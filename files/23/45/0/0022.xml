SECRET.(LR.Q. 41.)CABINET.COMMITTEE ON IRAQ.Repoet.THE Committee have held eight sittings, in the course of which they havemade an exhaustive examination of every aspect of the exceedingly difficult problemsubmitted to them. In this examination they have derived useful assistance fromthe presence and advice of Sir Percy Cox, who was summoned from Baghdad forthe purpose.The Committee have been conscious from the start that there exists a powerful body of opinion, both in Parliament and the country, which favours,plainly for financial reasons, an early escape from the responsibilities which HisMajesty&apos;s Government have been forced to assume in Iraq during and since thewar; while in some quarters there has been a loud call for immediate evacuation.The Committee have given due weight to these considerations, the force ofwhich they have no desire to minimise. On the other hand, they have felt it tobe their duty to examine with much care the extent to which the policy of evacuation, whether immediate or gradual, is reconcilable with the pledges into which the British Government have entered, with their obligations as themandatory Power, with the interests of the country and the peoples concerned,and with the larger interests of Great Britain and the British Empire.A novel factor has been introduced into the case, since the appointment ofthe Committee, by the proceedings of the recent Conference at Lausanne. Atthat Conference the future of Mosul, which is an important part of the mandated territory of Iraq, became one of the chief points of controversy between theTurkish and British Delegations. The Foreign Secretary, acting under the directinstructions of His Majesty&apos;s Government, declined to surrender the MosulVilayet to the Turks, and showed by argument that it was an indispensable andinseparable part of the Arab Kingdom of Iraq. He ended by referring the dispute to the League of Nations, but agreed to postpone the reference for a year in orderto admit of a possible settlement by negotiation between the British and turkish governments. It still remains for this solution to be incorporated in the Treatyof Peace.In these circumstances it is obviously impossible for His Majesty&apos;s Govern -ment to, surrender by any immediate decision, or by a hurried evacuation, theterritory which they have just declined to give up since it cannot be doubtedthat were the British forthwith to withdraw from Iraq, not only would Mosul fallimmediately into the hands of the Turks, but the Arab Kingdom, which so mucheffort has been expended in order to build up, would collapse. The conclusion ofpeace with Turkey therefore marks a definite stage upon which the entire futureOf Iraq will depend, and prior to which it is impossible to take decisions whichmight fatally compromise the prospects of peace.Apart from these considerations, which in any case necessitate a postpone-ment of withdrawal (even if the latter were accepted on its merits), the Committeehave come to the conclusion that immediate or precipitate withdrawal is impossiblefor the following reasons:  . . &apos;;  . &quot; &apos;&quot;     ,;(     1. It is the considered view of the General Staff and the Air Staff that the shortest possible time within which evacuation could be carried, out,without the assistance of further reinforcements, would probably be[9716] B 2
not less than two years.    A more rapid evacuation would entail thedespatch of reinforcements and a heavier expenditure; and the riskwould consequently be greater than were the retirement spread out. over a longer space of time. -..2. Whatever be the precise value and implications of the promises and&apos; ;     : engagements entered into by His Majesty&apos;s Government towards the $- &apos; - Arab State and the Arab peoples since 1914, an immediate withdrawal,involving the downfall of the Kingdom of Iraq, would be regarded, andin the opinion of a majority of the Committee would be justly regarded,as a breach of faith on the part of the British nation, which wouldinflict irreparable damage on British honour and British prestigethroughout the East.. 3. Such a withdrawal, in the present state of our mandatory relations with iraq, would also be a breach of faith to the League of Nations, atwhose instance we are continuing pending a final settlement by treaty or otherwise to carry on the Administration.- 4. The return of the Turks to Iraq and the downfall of the Arab kingdom would carry with it consequences of a far-reaching character. It is notto be anticipated that, a victorious Turkey would halt at Mosul. she would demand and she would obtain, because at any time she couldseize, Baghdad. Neither, having recovered Baghdad, would she be willing to stop short of Basrah, and even were such an arrangement;made, and a British boundary drawn between Baghdad and Basrah,the expenses of such an arrangement would be scarcely less great thanthose which we are now bearing, while Basrah would become a terrairredenta to Nationalist Turkey.5. Nor would the consequences, in all probability, be confined to the Kingdomof Iraq alone. The presence of a victorious Turkey at the head of thePersian Gulf could hardly leave British interests in that sea and in the adjoining area, from which the oil supplies of the British Navy are mainly drawn, unimpaired. A Bolshevised Persia, which is a not unlikely sequel, would aggravate the danger. Further it is the- - considered opinion both of the Foreign and Colonial Offices that thereturn of the Turks to Iraq would be the inevitable prelude to an agitation which would not cease until Syria and Palestine hadexperienced a similar fate.If this were the case, Britain would have fought the Asiatic war in vain,Turkey woTild have been the victor, not in Europe alone, but in Asia also, and hertriumph would not be a mere reversion to the status quo ante, but would plant an aggressive Islamic State in a central site, where she would be in a position tocontrol the fortunes of the Middle East, with results to British interests in thoseregions, and even in India, that might well in the long run be disastrous.: These considerations have led the Committee to the conclusion that a policyof immediate withdrawal is out of the question.It then remained for us to consider (1) within what space of time our obligations could honourably and safely be brought to an end; (2) what should bthe nature and extent of the financial outlay which we should accept during the interim period; (3) in what way a progressive curtailment and the ultimate termina-tion of British responsibilities can best be adjusted to the political or contractualrelations into which we have entered.1. Taking the conclusion of peace with Turkey as the datum point, weadvise the Cabinet that the period within which our mandatory relations with iraq and our expenditure on that country should be brought to an end shall be atthe longest four years from the date of ratification of the Turkish Peace Treaty.When we speak of the termination of the mandate, we have in mind that as soonas Iraq has been admitted to the League of Nations (and we have undertaken touse our good offices for her admission as soon as possible) the mandatory relationsbetween Great Britain and Iraq will automatically come to an end. But, in order Ito.eiiable her admission to come about, the League of Nations will require to be assured that the frontiers of Iraq are settled, and that a stable government hasbeen set up-conditions the satisfaction, of which must to a large extent deterrnhieour policy,&apos; as will presently be indicated&apos;, in tho intervening years; &apos;
2. During the interim period we recommend that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould incur no expenditure on civil administration other than the salary and expenses of the High Commissioner and his staff, for which an estimate can begiven. The liability of His Majesty&apos;s Government in these respects will notexceed , 30,000 a year. The military and air expenditure incurred by His Majesty&apos;s!&apos; Government on Iraq should be terminated within the same period, a progressive reduction taking place in each year. It has not been possible for the Committee to fix the exact total of this expenditure. The best plan would probably be forprovisional estimates to be agreed upon between the Treasury, Colonial Office andAir Ministry, and to be submitted to the Cabinet for approval. These, if approved,could be stated in the House of Commons, when the general statement of policyis made.There is a force of levies in Iraq, some 4,500 in number, mainly consisting ofAssyrian Christians and Kurds with British officers, for the payment of whichHis Majesty&apos;s Government is at present responsible, the financial resources of theIraq Government, who are bound to spend 25 per cent, of their budget on defence,being at present insufficient to enable them to do more than maintain the Arabarmy of about 4,000 men and the police. The Committee are of opinion (1) that itwould be unwise to disband this force at oiice, since, in four years&apos; time, it mayconstitute the most valuable element in the future defence of Iraq; and (2) thatits temporary maintenance, subject to any reduction or transfer it may be foundadvisable to make, should in consequence continue to be included in the Militarycharges borne by His Majesty&apos;s Government, on the understanding that king feisal be informed that all British expenditure on this head will cease at the close of the interim period, or if possible eaiiier, when it is contemplated that the levies will be absorbed into the defensive forces of the Iraq State.As regards the Treaty with King Peisal, which was signed in October 1922,and communicated officially to the Council of the League of Nations in November1922, but which has not yet been ratified, the Committee are of the opinionthat ratification could not, when the requisite conditions have been fulfilled,be &quot;honourably withheld. This, however, cannot in any case take place forsome time to come. For in the first place, Article 18 of the Treaty requires thatit must have been previously accepted by the Constituent Assembly, and secondly,this Assembly cannot be convened and cannot act until the frontiers of Iraq havebeen determined and the Mosul question settled. In other words ratification isnot likely to occur for at least a year, and possibly for longer. .In the meantime there are features in the Treaty, particularly as regards themilitary and financial obligations entailed, which have caused not unnaturalapprehension. If the recommendations which have been made in this Report are accepted by His Majesty&apos;s Government, it should be easy to remove theseapprehensions by a Protocol stating that, notwithstanding the provisions ofArticle 18 of the Treaty, which lays down that &quot; it shall remain in force fortwenty years,&quot; the Treaty itself shall terminate within the period now laid down,to be replaced, it may be, by some other arrangement on lines which will be indicated later on. i()In the meantime the Committee have prepared drafts of the subsidiaryAgreements provided for in Articles 7 and 15 of the Treaty, regulating the extent and conditions of the material support to be afforded during the interim period.These drafts are submitted herewith, and the Committee recommend that theyshould be concluded without delay. %,There remain the questions (a) whether the arrangements here proposed arelikely to be acceptable to the Iraq Government, and (b) what is the future thatmay be anticipated when the interim period comes to an end. On the first pointwe have the affirmative view of Sir Percy Cox, provided that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment announce their intention to: ratify the Treaty as modified.by the subsidiary Agreements and by the accompanying Protocol. ,.   !...,On the second point we anticipate that, although the mandatory relations ofGreat Britain with Iraq and the financial liabilities of His Majesty&apos;s Government, will have terminated within the stated period, it will&apos;, be the desire both&apos; of KingPeisal and the people of Iraq that the special, relations existing bletwben^GfreatBritain and the Arab Kingdom shall not be abruptly terminated, but that anagreement will be capable of conclusion between.the two Governments on some such lines as those of the Anglo-Persian Agreement of 1919, which may admit ofBritish assistance being,given to,the Arab State, at no. cost to His Majesty&apos;s
Draft Protocol.It is understood between the High Contracting Parties that, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 18, the present Treaty shall terminate upon Iraqbecoming a member of the League of Nations and in any case not later than fouryears from the ratification of peace with Turkey. Nothing in this Protocol shallprevent a fresh agreement from being concluded with a view to regulate the subsequent relations between the High Contracting Parties; and negotiations forthat object shall be entered into between them before the expiration of theabove period.Government, with a view to the development of its resources and the stability ofits administration. In such an arrangement special provision for the maintenanceof British interests, including those relating to the port of Basrah and facilitiesfor Imperial air routes, may profitably be included.Should these expectations be realised, it may yet be that Iraq will constitute a stable factor in the group of British interests in the East, without eitherimposing a burden upon the British Exchequer or entailing military liabilitieswhich His Majesty&apos;s Government would be unwilling to assume.(Signed on behalf of the Committee&quot;!DEVONSHIRE.March 23, 1923.

183 fag).1 1 -  &quot;.....-&apos;- .....&quot; &apos;lCf -HBP05T Og THE Q0I  LTTEB ON IRAQ,memorandum by the L^rd President of the Oounpil&amp;on CflP0lS7(2g),I am in agrsement with the main recommendationsof the Committee.    It seems that, up to a certain psint, theprsblem is very simple.     We want to be relieved %f the burdenaf Mesopotamia and of the responsibility of its administration and the Arabs want us to go.     Moreover, as to the planreoommen&amp;ed in the Report of carrying out this object I haveno criticism to offer.     The method by which the frontier isto be delimitated is a very good method,, namely, by submission to the &quot;decision of &quot;the League of Nations, and the diplomacyby which the Turks were induced to regard with favour this solution was admirable.     Further I have no comment to offeras to the other oonditions of the withdrawal.     No doubt itaannot be carried out in a day.     Four years seem a not un-.reasonable period for its completion.     Its gradual characteris convenient and workable.    In short it fulfils the twoessential oonditions - respect for the pledges of the Governmentand regard to the interests of the inhabitants^But though this plan is straightforward enough the carrying out of a policy founded upon it is not quite so easy.In the first place though we are anxious to be gone it wouldbe unacceptable that this should be effected by our being turned out by the Turks.     In the second place not only must we notbe turned out but if and when we go it is most undesirable thatthe...
the Turks should, occupy- the&quot;-plaoe&quot;we &apos;have vacated.    At the worst this might be the preface to the reappearance of theTurks at Baghdad and even at Basrah, and at the best it wouldmean that we must resign all connection with. Mesopotamia,since if we were to leave British officials in the employ ofthe Iraq Government, as is suggested, it would be out of thequestion that we should risk having- them disestablished andpossibly slaughtered by the triumphant Turks.    It is therefore a prerequisite - which I need not say is indicated by theCommittee - that a condition precedent to-&apos; the beginning c-four evacuation is that the Turks should have bound themselvesto recognise the independence of Iraq.    It is in this connect-ion that I venture to trouble the Cabinet because the proposal which has been made to us is not merely that the plan of theCommittee should be the accepted policy of the Government, butthat we should publish it;    and it is as to the advisability of this that I have the greatest doubts.     what effect would this publication have upon the prospect of the Turks signingan instrument which recognises the independence of Iraq?I suggest that once they know that xse have made up our mindsdefinitely to leave &quot;Mesopotamia they will begin to reconsider the settlement of the frontier to which they are committing themselves, and they will come to the conclusion that once we have publicly formulated a definite plan of. getting rid ofthis burden, opinion will force us to go through with it, andthat if they obstruct with sufficient Turkish perseverancethey will have their opportunity of re-entering into all thatthey lost as the result of the war.    It would surely then bebetter from a diplomatic point of view to say nothing aboutthe arrangements for evacuation until wo have got the signature of the Turks safe.-,
Is there any reason why we should.no Vadjon^^ih^namely accept the Report of the Committee so that Sir Percy Coa:Fmay know what is in front of him, hut keep It a seci-et?     Itis said that in fairness we must let Peisul know.    Certainly,if he can he trusted.    And why should he not he trusted?   Itis manifestly even more in his interests than in our own that nothing should bo said until the Turks have ontered. into a binding engagement.    The only other reason against secrecy ofwhich I am aware is the alleged necessity of meeting thedemands of British opinion.   Upon this I cannot speak with any confidence but I cannot help believing that the Housq of Commonswill quite understand that the obvious order of proceedingsis, first the Turkish Treaty and afterwards the arrangements for evacuation, and that the;&apos;&apos; will be quite reasonable on this headeven if the Turkish signature is delayed till the Autumn.   Inany case it is a dangerous principle cf policy to bo guided byunreasonable public oninioniI think there is an additional reason against public at-ion defending on the role of the League of Nations In theCommittee^ plan which I put in the background becaxi.se it isprobably not of the essence of the soheme.   The Committee pro-pose we should secure the termination of the mandate by obtain-ing the admission ef Iraq to the League.   I speak with hosi-tation because 1 am not familiar with the practice of theLeague.    But are wo quite sure there will bo no difficulties inthe way of this admission,?   cgv, the League must apparently besatisfied that Iraq has a stable Covernment,    Unless wo arc sureI suggest that in addition to other reasons submitted in this paper it would.be rash to puhlish a policy containing thisprovision.(Intd.)

CYPHER TELEGRAM TO SIR H. RUMBOLD (IiAUSAME), II0.1.OP 21st APRIL, 1923.Policy of His Eajesty^s Government with regard to Iraqas proposed &quot;by Cabinet Committee appointed to consider mattercontemplates progressive reduction of British expenditure there,,and final termination of British mandatory relations within fouryears from ratification of Turkish Peace Treaty British interestsbeing subsequently maintained by conclusion of anew agreement on lines of that which was contemplated ?;ith Persia.    This policy hasnot been finally approved by Cabinet but is likely to be acceptedby them.   Meanwhile Sir Percy Cox who has returned to Baghdad is anxious to announce decision,   A fear has been expressed that anysuch announcement might react unfavourably upon present or futurenegotiations with the Turks about Mosul, and might encourage themin pushing their claims.   Question of Mosul is excluded from yourimpending discussions at Lausanne, except in so far as you areinstructed to attempt to reduce the yearTs delay before referenceto League of Hations to six months.    Do you fear that publicationof British policy as regards Iraq will in any way revive thequestion or cause you difficulty at Lausanne?     On one hand It mightbe thought to encourage Turkish pretensions for immediate acquis-ition of Mosul.   On the other hand it might abate them, owing toimpression that task will be easier in four years time.Kindly favour me with your opinion.
23011 SIR H. RU11BOLD.   (LAU3AKHH).. No, 0? APRIL 23rd. 1923. &apos;Your- telegram Ifo, 1 (of April Slot;    Iraq),A public announcement of the now policy will certainly, ifit Is made, create a stir at Angora and in the Turkish press,     the reaction here will depend greatly on tho form of the announcement-which will doubtless be carefully considered.   Provided it is made clear that the decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government has been taken not in order to get rid of a burden but rather in discharge of definite responsibilities assumed by them, which responsibilitiesinclude that of launching Iraq on an independent and stableexistence as a new State, the effect on our proceedings here shouldbe useful rather than otherwise.Tho responsible Turkish representatives are already committed in two nays, viz.   (1) they have agreed to a settlement of the Mosulquestion by negotiation with,His Majesty1 s   overument - and failingan agreement, by reference to tho League of &quot;Nations;    (2) theyhave agreed to paragraph 1 though not to paragraph 2 of Article 16of Draft Peace Treaty.     That being so the publication of thedecision now contemplated would put us in a position   to say to thoTurks something like this :-&quot;We on our side are responsible for starting Iraq as a new and independent State.    You on your side have renounced any claim tosovereignty over that country.    Our statement of future policy showsthat we are approaching our task in a spirit of complete loyalty tothe principles which you and wo have both eutuioi&amp;ted.    One of thefirst conditions, however, of providing for the future stability oftho new State is that its frontier with Turkey should be settledas soon as possible.   T?e, therefore,, suggest that this should be expedited by reducing the period allowed for our endeavouring to1.
settle it amicably from twelve to sis months.&quot;       So far asthe present Conference is concerned] the Turks would find itdifficult to reject this suggestion.,It is more difficult to forecast the effect of pub-licatiou on the actual negotiations between us and the Turksregarding the frontier after Article 2 of the Treaty comes intoforce.    I sec no reason why it should stiffen their attitude.If anything it may make them more inclined to fee accommodatingduring that stage as they will probably cherish, though ofcourse they will not avow, the hope of re-adjusting four yearshonce any settlement unfavourable to themselves whethereffected In agreement with us or by decision of the league ofHationsaIn view ox the above considerations and the difficultyof concealing for any length of time either the fact that a new policy has been decided on or its general nature, I do notthink that any apprehension regarding the effect on theTurkish attitude towards the Mosul question br the course ofthe proceedings here need deter His majesty is Government frOmannouncing their decision if this is considered desirable for reasons connecred with the local situation in Iraq.

Turkishagents are encouraging this apprehension.      It is important that this should be removed.Best possible effect in Syria, Hejaz and Arabia generally,as well as in Iraq would be produced by publication.     Peopleof Iraq would be stimulated to defend solidly against any Turkishthreat the genuine independence    . . assured to them by our action.It will be brought home to Turks that Iraq is no more likely thanthe Hejaz to be recovered by them.
