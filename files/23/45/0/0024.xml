Stated in its briefest possible form, the situation dis-closed by the above was as follows:-Lord Curzon&apos;s Speech in the House of Lords on April SO,1923, resulted in the formulation of a new German proposal inregard to Reparations, dated May 2, 1923.   Notwithstandingstrong representations by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs in favour of a joint reply, and an apparently unquali-fied concurrence in this proposal by the Belgian Government, thelatter had been induced by the French Government to send a jointNote in reply to the German Note, and this reply had been handed to the German Ambassador on Sunday evening, May 6th,without any effective opportunity being allowed to His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto state their views.   The Italian Government shared the pointof view of, and wished to act with, the British Government, andthe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs had undertaken,after consulting the Cabinet, to communicate   to   M. Mussolini the.    - -     .    .   ..- . .    .    1   &apos;1 - ,      .        .&apos; -      - 1 .     /   : &apos; - .. .    - .&apos; &apos; .       &apos;        -   - .gist of the proposed British reply before despatching it toGermany.   The German Ambassador had made a personal communication to Lord Curzon indicating that the German Government would beready to take advantage of an opportunity to reopen the question and to make more precise proposals. **After hearing from the Secretary of State an exhaustiveresume&apos; of the situation., the Cabinet agreed(a) To approve the draft despatch submitted by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, subjectto any alterations which the Treasury might deem necessary from a financial point of view, andsubject to the following drafting amendments inaddition to any which the Foreign Office mightthemselves deem necessary:-Pgge 3, Para.(l), Line 3:    for &quot;much below&quot;put &quot;far belowLine 7:for &quot;amount&quot; put &quot;sum&quot;.Line 9:   After the word &quot;which&quot; put&quot;in the conditions predicated&quot;.PagePara,(2): Before tba word &quot;insufficiencyput &apos;&apos; obvious &quot; .itPageLine 10: Wrait the word &quot;frankly&quot; beforethe word &quot;recognise&quot;.Line 14:   After the word &quot;if&quot; omit thefollowing words:    &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government are correct in believing that&quot;;

The Cabinet were informed that the Admiralty hadreceived information to the effect that the Russian soviet authorities, of their own volition, were about to send the crew of the, British Steam Trawler JAMES JOHNSON,detained at Murmansk, to the entrance of the Kola Inlet,where arrangements would be made by the British senior naval Officer for their embarkation.   This, however,apparently did not apply to the Captain of the Trawler,who, the Cabinet were Informed, though his sentence hadbeen quashed, was to be tried again.The Cabinet were also informed that the Britishdespatch had reached the British Trade Commissioner at moscow, and that the latter had reported that he had warned British subjects in Moscow and Petrograd that theposition might become serious, but that he had no meansof warning confidentially persons in Russia outside thosecities.After a short discussion based on this information,the Cabinet agreed --(a) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should enquire into the positionof British subjects in Russia, and take such action as he might deem desirable,including, if necessary, a telegram tothe British Trade Commissioner in Mobcowasking for further details in regard tothe Captain of the Trawler JAMES JOHNSON,and authorising Mr Hodgson, if this had not already been done, to postpone the communication of thedespatch to the Russian Soviet Government:(b) That, in the event of pressure in Parlia-roent to publish the Note to the russian soviet Government, a reply should be made that ordinary courtesy dictated that thereshould be no publication until the reply of the Russian Soviet Government had beenreceived:(o) That if the Russian Soviet Government should publish the British despatch, the BritishGovernment should be free to do the same:(d) That, If necessary, the Foreign Office Vote,which was down for discussion on Thursday,May 10th, should be kept open in order thatthe question of the Russian Note might be debated in the House of Commons on thesecond day of the Foreign Office Vote,which could be taken on any day allotted- to Supply.
J5a&amp;&quot; TAX 3, The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed hiscolleagues that he was carefully watching the positionin Par 1 lament in regard to the piiblic outcry against thenew Income Tax (land and house property) assessmentsbased on the recent re-valuation necessitated by thefact that outside of London the quinquennial valuationhad not been made during the War.    He had arranged for ameeting between members of the House of Commons interestedin this question and representatives of the Inland Revenue,,which should ssi-ve to clear the air and to elucidate anysericus objections that might be raised.Whitehall Gardens, S.W..1,May       1983.r
CIRCULATED TO THE CABINET.Amended text of draft reply to German, note on Reparations. *X*FOREIGN OFFICE,May      , 1923.Your Excellency;H s Majesty&apos;s Government have given their careful attention to the memorandum which Your Excellency com-municated to me on the 2nd instant, and in which theGerman government put forward their proposals for asettlement of the question of Reparations.     this action On their part is well known to have been thesequel of a suggestion which I made in a debate in theBritish parliament on April 20th;   and His Majesty&apos;sGovernment therefore have a special interest in the response which has been returned to that appeal.I cannot conceal from Your Excellency that theproposals of your government have come as a great dis-appointment, ana that the unfavourable impression whichthey have made upon His Majesty*s Government as well&apos;as on their allies, is one which, in my opinion, theGerman government might and ought to have foreseenand therefore guarded against.     The proposals are farfrom corresponding either in form or in substance towhat His Majesty&apos;s Government might reasonably have expected to be made in answer to the advice which Ihave&apos;X*A slight change has been introduced at the instance of the Chancellor of Excheauer with theapproval of the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs in the paragraph numbered (2), on page 2,His ExcellencyHerr Sthamer,etc   etc     etc.
have on more than one occasion ventured to convey tothe German government through Your Excellency, and tothe more direct Invitation extended to them in the speech referred to.     The main grounds of this legitimatedisappointment are the following:-  (1)   The German government offer, in total pay-ment of their acknowledged debt, a sum which, fallingfar below the moderate amount forming the basis ofthe British scheme submitted to the Paris conference ofJanuary last, must have been known in advance to be al-together unacceptable to the allied governments. Further-more, the payment of even this inadequate sum is madedependent on the issue of a series of internationalloans, the success of which in the conditions predi-cated must be largely speculative.   So much so, thatthe scheme proposed by the German government actuallycontains provisions dealing with the contingency ofthe loans not materialising.   Moreover, the arrange-ments proposed under this head involve financial con-ditions less burdensome to Germany than if the loanswere to be successful, so that no real incentive isthereby held out for her to attempt to raise them.(2)   The failure of the German reply to indicatewith greater precision the nature of the guarantees which they are disposed to offer is more particularly to be regretted.     The allied governments, instead of receiving concrete and substantial proposals in thisrespect, are confronted with vague assurances and references to future negotiations, which, in a businesstransaction of this kind, are lacking in practicalvalue.The
The disappointment is enhanced &quot;by the belief whichHis Majesty&apos;s Government would like to entertain thatindications are to he found in the German memorandum that the German government recognize the responsibilityresting upon them to make an earnest effort to dischargeloyally their obligations under the treaty of Versaillesin a manner which the allies could regard as both equitable-able and sincere.     If Germany did intend to open theway to an effectual and speedy solution of a problem,the failure to settle which is gravely disturbing thepolitical and economic condition of Europe, and indeedof the whole world, then it seems unfortunate that she should not have shown a keener appreciation of the lines on which alone can any such settlement be sought.His Majesty&apos;s Government for their part are,per-persuaded that in her own interest Germany will see theadvantage of displaying a greater readiness to grapplewith the realities of the case and, discarding al]. ir-relevant or controversial issues, will proceed to re-consider and to expand their proposals in such a way asto convert them into a feasible, basis of further dis-cussion.    In such discussion His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwill at the suitable moment be ready to take part bythe side of their allies, with whom they share apractical interest in this question which they have no intention to abandon as well as the desire to terminatea situation of international peril.     But they cannotconceal from the German government that the first step towards the realisation of any such hope must be the recognition
recognition by Germany that a contribution much more serious and much more precise is required than any whichhas yet been forthcoming,I have the honour to be, with the highestconsideration,Your Excellency&apos;s most obedient Servant,
