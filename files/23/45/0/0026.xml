The Cabinet considered the situation arising out ofDEPORTEES .the decision of the House of Lords, by a majority, the same afternoon, that they had no jurisdiction to hear the appealPreviousReference:       entered on behalf of the Borne Secretary in the case of theCabinet 6 (22),^Conclusion 8.) deportation of Mr Art    0*Brian, of the Irish Self-Deter-rination League.    The effect of-this decision was that theearlier decision of the Court of Appeal would stand, makingIarliament-jJARY BUSINESS, absolute the writ under which,  on Wednesday May 16,  the.(previous reference:Cabinet 251(23) ; Con-clusion 2 .isHome Secretary must produce the person of Mr Art 0&apos;Brienbefore the Court.    The decision would-also involve therelease of some 100 persons who had teen arrested anddeported to Ireland at the same time as Mr 0&apos;Brian, under an Order made by the Home Secretary on March 11, 1923.The Cabinet were&apos;informed that Mr Art    0&apos;Brien had beenbrought to England and that some half dozen of the other persons originally deport 3d. were now in England for oon-sideration of their oases by the Mviaory Committee,   Thedecision of the House of Lords left the case in an unsatis-faotery jaosition,since, in the hearings       before the divisional Court and th^ Court of Appeal, three Judges&amp; in the aggregate had pronounced in favour of, and threeagainst, the action of the Government.
Having considered the matter from the point of view ofthe position of the Home Secretary, the maintenance of lawand order, the -urgency for action, the convenience ofParliament and the Parliamentary time-table for theremainder of the Session, the Cabinet agreed --possible delay(a) That it was necessary not only with the least /to indemnify the Home Secretary against?any possible consequences of the action he had taken on.behalf of the Government,but also, ih the interests of law andorder, to obtain,legislative powers forthe arrest and internment in Great Britainand North Ireland of persons engaged inplots against Ireland or other parts ofthe Empire:    that it was not practicable,in the short period of three days remain-ing before the Whitsuntide Recess, evenif extended at great inconvenience to members of Parliament to four or five days,to make sure of passing through parliamentary Bill providing for both points;    that,if a Bill of Indemnity only was introduced before the Recess, it would be said thatthe Government were more concerned toprovide for the security of the Home Secretary-  than for the preservation of law and order;but that if, on the introduction of the bill of Indemnity, the intention of the Govern-ment was announced to introduce afterWhitsuntide a Bill of arrest and internment,the passage of the Bill of Indemnity wouldprobably be as strongly opposed as a singleBill covering both points, and the subsequentpassage of the second Bill after the Recess,when interest had evaporated, might bedifficult:(b) That, in these circumstances, provided theposition of the Home Secretary was safeguardedduring the Racess (as was believed to be thecase, though the point was still under con-sideration by his legal advisers)&apos;the best plan would be to introduce a Bill4coveringboth points, in the House of Commons on thefollowing day, and that the question whetherit be introduced in the ordinary way orunder the Ten Minutes Rule be left to thedecision of the Chancellor of the Exchequerand his Cabinet colleagues in the House ofCommons:(c) That, in order not to dislocate at short notice the arrangements of members of bothHouses of Parliament for the WhitsuntideRecess, the House of Commons should.beasked to take the Second Reading and sub-sequent stages of the Bill immediately afterthe rs-assembly of Parliament:
(d) That the Chancellor of the Exchequer3hould consider whether, in ordv-r toreduce the dislocation o^ the time-tabl*? for the Parliamentary Sessioninvolved in th* passage of this emer-gency legislation, it would be expedient to ask the House of Commons to re**assembleafter the Recess on Monday, May 28th,instead of on Tuesday, May 29tht(e) That Mr Art   0&apos;Brien, when released onWednesday, May 16th, should immediately be re-arrested on a charge of conspiracy^on which, the Cabinet were informed, theDirector of Public Prosecutions and responsible Ho^e Office Officials had advised that the Crown had a good case:(f) That a similar course should be adopted as regards any of the deportees (said tonumber half a dozen) against whom an equally good case could be made out,and who should be arrested on landing inGreat Britain on the same charge a3 Mr ArtOVBrien:(g) That the remainder of the deportees,on arrival in Great Britain, should be released, and watched, but, unless theycommitted a breach of the law, shouldnot be re-arrested or&apos; interned, pendingthe passage of the new legislation referredto above *
