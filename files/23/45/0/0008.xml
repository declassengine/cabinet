Draft of the King&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament.February 13, 1923.My Lords and Members of the House op Commons,The Conference which was held in London early in December on the subjectof the payment of Reparation by Germany was resumed in Paris in January.My Government, in their desire to hasten a complete settlement of the Reparationquestion, offered to the Allied Governments far-reaching concessions on allied debts to this country; I greatly regret that it proved impossible to reach a generalagreement. The French and Belgian Governments have therefore proceeded toput into force the plan which they favoured, and the Italian Government havecountenanced their action. My Government, while feeling unable either to concuror participate in this operation, are acting in such a way as not to add to thedifficulties of their Allies.During the past three months, the plenipotentiaries of My Government, inconjunction with those of the other Allied Powers, have been engaged at lausanne in a sincere and patient effort to bring to a close the conditions of warfare which for over eight years have desolated the regions of the Near East,.I greatly regret that, in spite of the conciliatory spirit shown by the Allies,and of the immense concessions which they were prepared to make, the Treatywhen on the verge of signature was declined by the Turkish Delegation.But I cherish the hope that, when a full report of the proceedings has reachedthe Turkish Government, the latter may still be disposed to accept the treaty and that the opportunity, so earnestly and laboriously prepared, of rebuilding thepeace of the East and the stability of the future Turkish State may not be sacrificed.I welcome the prospective settlement of our War Debt to the United Statesof America, which reflects the determination of our people to meet their obligations.Members of the House of Commons,The Estimates for the public service in the coming year will be laid before you in due course.The financial burdens of the country are heavy, and reductions in public,expenditure remain essential to the well-being of the State.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons,The serious state of unemployment among My people causes Me the deepestconcern, and must continuously engage the attention of My Ministers. Theincrease which has recently taken place in our oversea trade gives ground forconfidence in the future, and I earnestly trust that we may anticipate a continuedimprovement in both our external and our home trade. I look forward moreparticularly to a greater development of inter-Imperial trade in co-operation withthe various Governments of My Empire. Meanwhile full effect will be given tothe special emergency measures which have been initiated to afford relief to thesituation.The condition of agriculture continues to receive the careful consideration ofMy Ministers. With a view to the alleviation of some of the difficulties in theindustry you will be invited to consider proposals for granting credit facilities toagriculturists.The anomalies and inequalities of the present system of local taxation have long called for reform and My Ministers are examining the whole question. It ishoped that it may be found practicable to deal with the subject on a comprehensive-sive basis and, in particular, to remove some of the burdens which press on the occupiers of agricultural land.Among the measures which will be presented for your consideration will beBills dealing with unemployment insurance benefit, housing, trade boards, andindustrial assurance.The Departmental Committee appointed to consider the operation of theIncrease of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act.has now made its finalreports and proposals will be made to you to carry into effect certain of theCommittee&apos;s recommendations. You will also be asked co deal with difficulties arising out of the legal interpretation of the Act.Measures will be submitted to you for simplifying legal procedure andeffecting economies, especially in the County Courts, and for the consolidation ofvarious branches of the law, particularly that relating to the Supreme Court andto Real Property and Conveyancing.And I pray that the blessing of Almighty God may rest upon yourdeliberations.
