INDIANMILITARYRF.QUIRE-feNmS ,krtilleryCor NativeBtates .3.    After careful and sympathetic consideration ofthe reasons in favour of granting a limited amount of artillery (15-pdr., 2.75 inch and 13-pdr.) to the militaryforces.of certain Native States (Paper C .1.-4350), theCabinet reached the conclusion that,  on broad grounds ofImperial policy- the reasons in favour, of the proposal were outweighed by the disadvantages.    In particular,they were influenced by the consideration that the grantof this privilege to the Native Princes would be followedby a claim for the equipment of the Indian Army (consistingof Indian troops) with similar artillery,- a claim whichit would then be difficult  to resist.    The Cabinettherefore agreed --To confirm the Conclusion of the CabinetCommittee that the Native Chiefs shouldnot. be allowed to raise batteries armed with modern artillery (India, B.I.,  Con-clixsion 2, of 25th January,  192 3) .JfAZTRISTAN,^rs-u. ousiRsferenc e:iablnet 3(23)    Con-fclus ion 5 ,)The Cabinet approved the Conclusions of theCabinet Committee -(a)  That  the request  of the Government ofIndia for a Commission to examine frontierpolicy should not be acceded to:(b)That the present policy with regard toWaziristan should be carried out withvigour and determination (India,  B ,1.,Conclusion 3,. of 25th January,  1923.)

The Committee had under consideration a Memorandum bythe Minister of Health covering the draft Mental Treatment Bill(CP. 25 (23) !. Some discussion took place on the proposal con-tained in Clause 4 of the Bill for placing in approved institutionspatients suffering from incipient mental disorder who were incapable of volition or minors. Emphasis was laid on the desirability, fromthe point of view of facilitating the passage of the Bill, of making provision that in such cases the patient should not be placed inthe approved institutions solely on the recommendation of twomedical practitioners, but that a recommendation from someimpartial non-medical person should also be required.The Committee were also informed that the Scottish Board ofControl desired the application of certain of the clauses of theBill to Scotland, and that for this purpose it would be necessary to alter the title of the Bill.The Committee agreed-^(1.) To adjourn the further consideration of the MentalTreatment Bill with a view to proposals beingmade by the Minister of Health tor incorporatingB 2
iii Clause 4 some form of non-medical protection in the case of patients incapable of volition andminors.(2.)

The Parliamentary Secretaryto the Ministry of Transport urged the desirability of dealing atthe earliest possible occasion with the questions of headlights onAphides and rear lights on bicycles. The police and the motorrepresentatives strongly favoured rear lamps on bicycles, but,having regard to the strong feeling on the matter, he would beprepared to accept reflectors for bicycles provided the headlightprovisions of the Bill could stand.The Committee agreed To request the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry ofTransport to circulate a fresh Memorandum to the Cabinetdealing with the urgency of the matter, and specifying indetail his proposals.6. With reference to Cabinet 8 (23), Conclusion 2 (m), theCommittee had before, them a Memorandum by the President ofthe Board of Trade relative to a question which had arisen onClause 1 (6) of the approved War Charges (Validity) Bill.Emphasis was laid on the importance of securing the early passage into law of the Bill, particularly in view of the fact that a numberof judgments against the Government would probably be obtained in the near future.The Committee agreed To adjourn the further consideration of the point raisedby the President of the Board of Trade on the WarCharges (Validity) Bill until the next meeting.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,March 2, 1923.
