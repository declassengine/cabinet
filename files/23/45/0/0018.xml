The question of how far this measure would gotowards improving the position of agricultural labourers in regard to wages was considered torequire further exploration before final deci-pions could be taken and announced in regardto the other recommendations in the Report,though on their merits several of the proposalsof the Minister of Agriculture, including theproposed duty of 10/- a quarter on MaltingBarley, with a preference to the Dominions,commended-themselves to the Cabinet.The; Report of tha Agricultural Tribunal was accordingly. referred to the following CabinetCommittee for consideration and Report:- .The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries(in the Chair),...

APPfiKDlX.AGRICULTURAL RATES RELIEF COMMITTED.REPOHT.The Committee were appointed &quot;by the Cabinet on the14th February, 1923, to examine and report to the cabinet as to how local rates in agricultural districts oan best be assisted out of the Road Fund.     The Committee haveread these terms as qualified by the decision of theCabinet given at the same tine &quot;that such assistance shallnot be given until the Rating Bill has become law&quot;*The Committee consider that the question ofScotland should be dealt with separately and a separate report on the subject by the Secretary for Scotland is appended.It will be recollected that the Cabinet Committeeon Valuation and Rating Reform proposed to embody in thedraft Bill a provision that the assessment of agricultural land for rating purposes should bo reduced to a general level of 25%&apos; of the rateable value, instead of as at presentround about B0% in rural districts and 60  in urban areas*Such a concession would necessarily entail a reduction inthe total assessable value of the areas concerned.     Whileit is expected that the general revaluation proposed wouldin many rural areas more than counter-balance the lose inrateable value from this cause, it was evident that indistricts with a high proportion of agricultural land thenet rosult would still be an Increase in the poundage ofrates in the districts, and it was therefore desirable tofind   oome means of giving assistance, at least in thesecases and, if possible, in the rural districts generally to allay the opposition from the non-agricultural ratepayers.The Comnlttee accordingly suggested that &quot;the basis on
which contributions are made to Local Authorities out ofthe Road Fund should be revised so as to afford a somewhatgreater measure of assistance to rural areas than atpresent in respect of the heavy costs now falling upon them in respect of the highvfay expenditure&quot;.In proceeding on the assumption that the assistanceto rural ratepayers is to be given in conjunction with ascheme of valuation and rating reform, we recognise that considerable difficulties will arise in passing such ameasure during the present Session and, moreover, that any act could not come into full operation for two or threeyears.   We are, howeverimpressed by the very strong demand for the relief of the burden of rates on the farmers,and we desire to point out that, for the same sum of money,greater relief will be assured to this class by couplingthe relief with a reduction In the assessment of the farmers than by giving It to rural districts as a wholeon the present basis of rating, when agricultural land will only participate in any relief given to an averageextent of 23)v of the whole.The Cabinet made it clear on the 15th Februarythat the reference to this Committee Intended to apply tothe whole scope of the Read Fund finance, and not merely to such future surplus or such expansion of the revenue as might become available.This direction would, of course, cover a completerevision of the basis of distribution of the Road Fund and,particularly, the present basis of grants to the London andthe County Boroughs.   Such a revision would no doubt come within the scope of the wider enquiry into the general question of road finance which the Cabinet postponed on the14th February for consideration in more favourable circum-stanccs.   Further, to make any reduction at the present time
1    166in the existing level of assistance given from the Road fund to London and the County Boroughs would raise acute political issues and greatly increase the difficulty of obtaining.Parliamentary sanction for the scheme of reform submittedby the Valuation Committee.We have accordingly felt it necessary to restrictour consideration to such balance of revenue as is likely tobe available in the Road Fund after existing commitmentshave been met.     With the very short experience so far available of the growth in the revenue of the Fund, it is difficult toform a reliable forecast of future revenue.     The Ministry ofTransport consider that, in the financial year 1923/24, a sumof  1,000,000 could be made available for the purpose of assisting rural districts in Great Britain, and. we are disposed to think that this estimate might be increased, without serious risk, to  1,500,000.     Reliance on this higher estimate might involve some addition to the amount of cover which the treasury have undertaken to give to the Funds during the next few years.As far as present indications go the revenue of theRoad Fund seems likely to Increase somewhat more rapidly in future than the charges upon it, but it Is of course un*-desirable to pledge the whole balance of; the revenue forany long period ahead.     The rural districts will no doubtexpect any relief given in connection with the Valuation Billto be of a permanent character but it has to be remembered thatthe immediate object to be secured is the reduction of theburden on the farmer.     Other ratepayers in the rural areas have no comparable claim to relief but they will certainlyobject to any senaibles&apos; increase in their rate burden.     It IsImportant therefore both from the political point of view, as also to secure that the farmer does in fact get relief whenhis assessment Is reduced,, that the introduction
i   rJOf the scheme should not be attended by an immediate increaseof rates in rural areas.     We have accordingly attached more importance to securing that the relief from any scheme of grants is immediate and considerable than that it ispermanent.A further point to be borne In mind, if the limitedfunds available are to be used with the greatest effect,Is that the relief should be adjustable to the circumstancesof particular districts, in fact that the grants should begreatest where the reduction in the farmers&apos; assessmentwould entail the greatest increase In the poundage ofrates.     This Is likely to be secured best under a schemewhich permits of the exercise of a wide discretion bythe controlling Department,It Is expected that the general Rating and Valua-tion Soheme (apart from any schema with which it may becoupled for the reduction of the farmer*s assessment) would bring about an all-round increase in rural assessments butthat the increase would, In many districts, be relativelysmaller for the farmer&apos;s assessment than for the non-agricultural ratepayer^ assessment.     There would auto-matically follow In those districts a transfer of rate-burden from the farmer to the non-agr I cultural ratepayer.This burden would be additional to that which would betransferred to him as the consequence of the coming intooperation of any scheme for the reduction of the farmer&apos;sassessment.     For the first of these additional burdensthe non-agricultural ratepayer could not equitably be given any compensation.     For the second we think he could reason-ably claim some measure of corapennatien/We have already stated that the general Ratingand Valuation scheme cunnot (as we are advised) be broughtfully into operation for two or three years after thepassing of the necessary legislation^     Meanwhile the
rural ratepayers - farmers and others alike - are claimingto be entitled to an immediate reduction of the ratesraised to meet expenditure on rural roads, which &quot;has,in ^creased rapidly consequent upon the development of motortraffic.    It is obvious that if, to satisfy this claim(which has recently bean Supported by a resolution ofthe House of Commons),, the available Road Fund money were paid away before the contemplated reduction of the farmer&apos;aassessment takes effect, the saine money would not also beavailable to satisfy the claim which-the non-agriculturalratepayer would be certain to makev at the appropriate time, for compensation for the rate-burden&apos; w hie h would fall to be transferred to him as a result of that reduction of assessment. ..It seems to us impracticable with the sum now available, to satisfy fully either (i) the claim of the rural ratepayers - agricultural and non-agricultural.for a reduction of the rates required from them to meet expenditure on rural roads, or (ii) the claim of the non-agricultural ratepayer for compensation for the burden whichwould be transferred to him on a reduction of the farmer&apos;sassessment.If, however, some relief is to be given to the rural ratepayer at an early date, coupled with some immediate and larger measure of relief to the agriculturalratepayer, it would seen necessary to provide:--(a) fo-r a reduction in the assessment to 25$ ofthe rateable value on agricultural land asAo-on as practicable, without waiting for thepperation of the general Rating and Valuation&apos; /re form&apos;:j(b) to couple this reduction with a scheme for theallocation out of the Road Fund of the greatestpracticable measure of relief to the rural areas,euqh relief to be given in largest proportion to-the most agricultural of the rural areas, and,amongst them,&quot;to those having the heaviesttotal-rate-burden and the heaviest rate-burdenin respe,ct of highways ;    and
(c) to provide that the general Rating and Valuationscheme and the reduction of the farmers assess-ment shall he linked together by means of aprovision that the reduction of assessment shall come to an end if by the 51st December, 1925, ageneral Rating and Valuation Reform Bill has not received the Royal Assent,Proposals have -been submitted to us by the Ministryof Transport which will, we think, admit of relief being givenin the manner contemplated in (b) above *It Is suggested that the Ministry of Transport should proceed to consider in each case where there is likely to bean increase in rates how far any hardship to non-agriculturalratepayers resulting from the lowering of the agriculturalassessment can be mitigated.(a) by endeavouring to arrange with the County Councils&quot;to place upon the County rate (and thus^ransfera portion ofthe charge from the rural to the urban ratepayers) the costof classified roads at present borne on the district rate,with the aid of liberal grants from the Road Fund towards-putting these roads where necessary into a sound condition;(b) by making similar reconditioning grants for themore important unclassified roads remaining with the district councils;(c) by continuing the present policy of adding to themileage of classified roads, (carrying maintenance grants of50% or 25%) where traffic considerations justify this course.We recommend that the Treasury, the Ministry ofHealth, and the Ministry of Transport co-operate in thepreparation of a scheme on these lines to be brought intooperation as soon as practicable5Signed on behalf of the Committees,(Signed)     R.A. .

ANKEXBRE TO APPENDIX.AGRICULTURAL RATES RELIEF.B$ff6rt by the Secretary for Scotland on the Scottish. aspect of the question,,The Scottish side of the problem presents peculiar features- which will require special consideration.In the.first place it has to be noted that the generalmeasures of reform called for In that country will be concerned only with rating.    No amendment of the general valuation system is proposed as in England.   But as indicated in the Secretary&apos;for Scotland&apos;s memorandum (R.T.C.7)  of the 22nd January, 1925,the reduction of the rating basis for farms in Scotland will inconsequenco of the division of the rates between owners andoccupiers, and the limitation to the occupiers&apos; rates of the rating relief presently given under the Agricultural Rates(Scotland) Act, 1896, be attended with considerable difficulty,especially if, as seems to be essential, the reduction of the rating basis is extended to the owners half of the rates.    Thegrant required in connection with a reform of the kind cannotbe placed at less than from  500,000 to  600,000 which mightbe partly provided from tho limited .surplus of  1,000,000 to 1,500,000 referred to above, and partly by a revision of thebasis on ifhich the Roads Fund is now distributed.sA difficulty, however, more directly relevant to theremit to this Committee arises In connection with the suggestedscheme for giving compensatory relief to rating authorities from the Road Fund for tho loss which would b e; occasioned bythe writing down of the rating basis for farms&quot;.     In scotland the greater part of the rates which would be affected by thiswriting down are levied parochially and the&apos;ratio ofagricultural to non-agricultural, valuation - and consequently the effect of the writing, down - would vary from parish to&apos;parish.   The road rate, on the other hand, is levied uniformlyover the whole of a County District which/may contain as many as 10 or even a larger number of parishes!,    Thus, the incidence of any relief from the Road Fvmd such as is contemplated will be uniform over the whole 10 or more parishes,although the requirements of the several parishes In rospect of relief may be widely different.It is not easy to see how this difficulty is to bogot over if the relief is to come wholly from the.;Road Fundor, at any rato, Is to be wholly devoted to roads.     Onemethod of dealing with the situation would obviously be to associate with the relief from the Road Fund - an increasedgrant from Exchequer in aid of some important branch ofparochial expenditure - e.g,, pauper lunacy.    It would require a grant of something like  250,000 to raise the existingPauper Lunacy Grant to 50f, of the net expenditure as contemplated by the Finance Bill of 1914.   But that is a matter outside thepresent remit,, - ....,      - Another...&apos;..
Another ground,for considering that relief must be given in Scotland to other purposes than roads. If the rating basis -of farms is cut down - is that there la Ie33scope for applying the suggestions of the Ministry ofTransport in&apos;-that country*.
