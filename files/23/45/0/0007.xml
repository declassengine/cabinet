..,\- S EGRET--OABINET 7  (P.5)CONCLUSIONS of a Meeting of the cabinet held at 10, Downing Street^  S.W.l,.on tuesday,  FEBRUARY 6,  1933,  at  3-30, p.mifJffB TURKISH 1*      In the absence of the Secretary of State for peace CONFERENCE._______ Foreign Affairs through indisposition, Sir Eyre C cwe2(Previous reference cabinet 6^24), tim Permanent Under-Secretary of State for ForeignxConclusion la)Affairs,  informed the Cabinet that withm the lasttwenty-four hours the French Ambassador has made two important communications on behalf of the French Goveiment.The first communication was that received during the meeting of the Cabinet on the previous day(Cabinet 6(23), Conclusion 1(b)  ),  to which, under instructions from the Marquess Curzon, Sir Eyre Crowehad replied that the next move in regard to the TurlcisPeace Treaty was with the Turks and that Ismet Pashashould be informed that if he had any communication to inake,  it should be addressed to the Secretary-General of the Conference, who was still at Lausanneand would forward it to the Powers.*Ehe second communication was ambiguous andcontradictory.      The first paragraph stated that theFrench Government had learned that Ismet Pasha was due^ to leave Lausanne at 7,0 a,in.   to-morrow,       but that,.if the Allies were willing to sign the Treaty he had rejected on Sunday, he would be prepared to remain at lausanne *
The sab sequent paragraphs, however,, proposed that  theTreaty to he signed should contain -concessions which on Sundaythe Allies had felt it impossible to accept,      Por example,Part HI of the draft Treaty,  containing the Economic Clauses,was to be omitted, a proposal which the French and ItalianDelegations, when pressed by the Marquess Oarzon, had declaredwas beyond the extreme limits of possible concession.    Further,,a clause was to be inserted in regard to the Judicial Regime in substitution for the Capitulations, based on a rejected Turkishproposal- as amended by the Italian Delegate in consultationwith Ismet Pasha after the Conference 1  an amendment which hadnot yet been communicated to the British Government.     Anadditional Turkish proposal in regard to the regime for foreign-ers, the.text of which had not been received, was also to beincluded,&apos;Sir Eyre Crowe had pointed out the inconsistency of thefirst and later paragraphs and had informed the Fi*-ench ambassador that it-was impossible for the British Government to undertaketo sign Articles,, the nature of which was unknown, and the ambassador had. undertaken to obtain details by telephone.The. Conference agreed(a) To approve the attitude taken upby Sir Eyre Crowe:(b ) To reserve their decision untildetails were available:(c) To meet on the following afternoonat 3,.30 ppm,  if the Foreign office had received the material necessaryfor a decision.
