In view of the strong and numerous representations made to members of the Cabinet by individual supporters in both Houses of Parliament against the proposal to aakParliament to grant the powers required by the Home secretary and against ihelr inclusion in a single Bill with an indemnity-nity to the Government for action taken in regard to theIrish Deportees, the Cabinet agreed -(a) To reverse the decision reached on May 15th(Cabinet 26(23), Conclusion 1) in favour ofthe inclusion of both points in a singleBill:(b) That the Home Secretary should, on thefollowing day, circulate to Parliament aBill to prohibit the institution andprosecution of legal proceedings in respectof action taken under the Restoration of order in Ireland Regulations:(c) That the Bill should be on the lines of adraft presented to the Cabinet at the meet-ing, but that the final drafting, to meetcertain criticisms of detail, should beleft to the Home Secretary and Attorney-General :(d) That, in view of the uncertainty which existed as to the legal powers at thedisposal of the Government, it was desir-able to obtain an independent impartialopinion as to the sufficiency of those powers and as to any extension requiredto enable the Government to deal withparsons plotting in Great Britain againstthe Irish Free State:
(e) That a Select Committee whether of bothHouses or of the House of Commons only,was an unsuitable body, partly because it was almost bound to report on partylines, and partly because, for this veryreason, it would be difficult to securethe secrecy which the nature of some ofthe evidence to be presented renderedessential.   The best plan, in the cir-cumstances, was considered to be theappointment of an independent tribunal of three eu-inent and unbiassed persons,one of whom should be possessed of legal qualifications and experience,and to consult the Leaders of theOpposition in regard to the panel from whom this tribunal should be chosen:(f) That the Lord Chancellor should draftan announcement to the above effect,and that, if acceptable to the Chan-cellor of the Exchequer, the latter,as Leader of the House, should announceit on the following day in the House ofCommons.
(previous reference:(g3), Con-elusion 4.)Bi After consideration of a Memorandum by the Ministerof Agriculture and Fisheriescovering the draft of theAgricultural Credits Bill (Paper 0,P.-237(23)) and theMinutes thereon of the Committee of Home Affaire (H.A.C.11(23) Conclusion 1), the Cabinet agreed(a) That Clause 1 (5) of the draft Bill,providing that an advance by the1Public Works -Loan Commissioners toan approved Association should bemade at the minimum rate allowed forthe time being for loans out of theLocal Loans Fund (4f$), should beexojsedt thus leaving the interestrate, as is usual, to be fixed by theTreasury, who would make it      overminimum, i.e.,5%(b) To approve the introduction forthwithof the Agricultural Credits Bill inthe form of the draft attached toC.P.-237(23), subject to the amend-ment in (a) above and to the amend-ment of Clause 1 (6) as recommendedby the Committee of Home Affairs,

The Cabinet had before them a draft Agricultural BatesBill circulated by the Minister of Health (Paper CP .-242(23)) and the Minutes of the Committee of Home affairs thereon (.H.A.C. 11(23), Conclusion a).At the Committee of Home Affairs a proposal had beenmade on behalf of the Chancellor of the Exchequer that theproposed grant should be on a fixed rather than a variablebasis.   The main reason for this proposal had been thatotherwise the door would be opened to a strong demand fromthe farmers for the fixed;, grant made by the Exchequer in1896 (when the assessment of agricultural land was reducedto one-half the rateable value) to be raised so as to bring it up to an amount equal to half the rates on the land,that is to say, to the 1896 proportion of the rates, whichhave since been raised, thus involving a great increase inthe grant,On being informed that the variable grant would onlyapply so long as the 1896 Act applied (ife.,, pending thepassage into law of the Valuation and Rating Reform Bill)and that the latter was extended annually under the expiring laws Continuance Act, the Chancellor of the Exchequer with-drew hie opposition to a variable grant.&quot;(a) That the grsra-t should be variablebut not extending bevond 31st March.1925t unless Parliament shall in themeantime have passed a valuation and Rating Reform Bill&quot;.m*eswouxct oe reaay Dsiore ruts sna ui vub niuisun-tide Recess:(c) That the Minister of Health should have authority to circulate to Parliament the &apos;Agricultural Rates Bill.
