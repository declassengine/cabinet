Circular letter to be addressed by the Treasury toi Departments.Treasury Chambers,Whitehall, S.W.March, 19&amp;3*Sir, .  ,I am directed by the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty5sTreasury to acquaint you, for the information of the Secretary ofStats, that His Majesty&apos;s Government have had under careful review the procedure which is intended, to ensure that the financialbearings and feasibility of all questions of policy should becomprehensively examined in advance between the Treasury and theDepartments concerned so as to enable the business of the Cabinetto be conducted with full knowledge of all the relevantcircumstances and considerations.His Majesty&apos;s Government are satisfied that the theoryunderlying: the present system is sound and is in accordance withthe accepted principle of. business as ordinarily understood viz;that before a decision is invited or reached a proposal shouldhave been subjected to careful and critical examination from thepoint of view of getting the best value for money and of makingsure that there is money available.The Treasury as the central and as the Finance Departmentof Government  is charged (inter alia) with the responsibility bothof taking a. bird1 s eye view of the position and of providingfinancial and economic advice and criticism.      And the theory ofthe existing procedure accordingly involves earlyclose, and continuous consultation with the Treasury.As, however, the practice of Departments does not alwaysconform to the recognised&apos;theory, and to that extent public business is deprived of the safeguards which every private business rightly insists upon as essential, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment desire it to be clearly understood throughout the
Public. Service that for the future any proposal involving thTaxpayers&apos; money, whether in the form of direct expenditureor of Government guarantees or otherwise, will only beadmitted for decision (one way or the other) at the cabinet after it has been examined in all its aspects between theTreasury and the Department from which the proposalemanates..  I am, etc.The Permanent Under Secretary of State,
