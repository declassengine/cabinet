The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Pensions (Paper O.P,-S03(23)) on a PrivateBill entitled The War Pensions Act Amendment Bill, to beintroduced by Mr P.

TheMemorandum pointed out that under the present system thequestion whether a disability is attributable to or aggra-vated by war service is an issue of fact for the decisionof the Ministry of Pensions, subject to an appeal to anindependent Tribunal.   The Bill would effect a fundamental change in this principle by substituting- a provision thatany disability or incapacity from which any ex-Service man who has served, for however short a time, at home or abroadmay suffer, however long after his discharge (no time limitsbeing recognised) should be presumed to be due to or aggra-vated by his service unless or until the contrary is proved.The Cabinet agreed -(a) That it should be made known that theGovernment could on no account acceptthe principle involved in the Bill, onthe ground that it imposed an unfairobligation on the State and that there-fore the Government would oppose the bill being read a Second Time:(b) That the Minister of Pensions should arrange with the Government Whips for him to address a meeting of the support-ers of the Government in a Committee Roomof the House of Commons.

APPENDIX.Circular to be issued by Unemployaient Grants Committee, toLocal Authorities.Sir,I am directed by the Unemployment Grants Committee to refer to their Circular Letters of the 1st June and 7th Deoemba r 1933with regard to Schemes of work undertaken by Looal authorities with state assistance for the relief of unemployment (Luringthe winter of 192S-33.In the abnormal circumstances of the last two wintersIt has been necessary to make considerable provision forunemployment.     The Government hope that the conditions which made this neoessary will progressively disappear.     Generalunemployment Has already improved and it Is hoped with someconfidence that this Improvement will oontinue.     At the sametime the industrial situation in some districts next wintermay warrant the-execution of further public works for therelief of unemployment.     The Government accordingly wish tobe in a position to consider making such provision for further assistance as the situation demands and the finances of thecountry admit.The Government will accordingly be obliged if LocalAuthorities will again co-operate with them by at onceconsidering the prospects In their area, and by submitting to my Committee as soon as possible, and In any case not later than the end of July, a preliminary statement of works whichoould be put in hand if required.It will be appreciated that the extent to which government assistance oan be given must in any oase be strictly limited,In view of the need of reducing the financial burden of thecountry.     Local Authorities should, therefore, weigh carefullyin each oase whether having regard to the prospects of improvedemployment any special scheme is needed in their area next winter.
Ml).&apos;.LIt will not be necessary at this stage to submitdetailed drawings and plans.     Approximate estimates orexpenditure, of numbers of men to be employed, and of duration of work etc., on special forms to be obtained from thisCommittee will be sufficient.As regards the terms of assistance,  the Government would propose the following:-I.      Works carried out from Capital, and financed by Loan-(a)   Revenue Producing Schemes.Grants equal to 50% of the interest on loans raisedby Local Authorities for a period of not lessthan 10 years, in respect of expenditure on approved schemes, will be paid by the State fora period of 5 years.(D)    Schemes for work undertaken in connection with or as, part of a revenue producing undertaking whichin the view of the competent department., will not themselves direoily produce revenue or are netlikely to produce revenue for a considerablenumber of years.Grants equal to 50% of the interest on loans raised for a period of not less than 10 years inrespect of expenditure on approved schemes will be repaid by the State for a period of 15 years or forthe period of the loan, whichever is the lesso(c)     Non-Revenue Producing Schemes.Grants equal to 65% of the interest and sinking fundcharges pn loans raised to meet expenditure on approved schemes, will be paid by the State for aperiod of one-half of the term of the loan, subjectto a maximum of 15 years.II.     Works financed otherwise than by Loan.Grants will be paid by the State on the basis of60% of the wages bill of unemployed men taken on for the work.The general conditions previously laid down will continueto apply.     It will be optional for Local Authorities to carryout schemes by direct labour or through contractors, but theview of the Government la that the contract system should beadopted to the        utmost possible extent.I am, etc.,
