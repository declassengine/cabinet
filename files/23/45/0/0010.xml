At a meeting held the. sameReference&apos;Cabinet. 4 ( 3)Conclusion 5).Reference morning between the French Delegation and a British&apos;Cabinet 4 (23) 0Delegation composed of the Prime Minister, the Bor-dPresident of the Council, the Secretary of State forforeign Affairs, and the Secretary of State for &apos;iar, -M..    le Trocquer and General Payot had. asked for; per-- -mission to run troop trains and supply trains through -the British occupied zone,  and as the Germans could&apos;not be oounted on to run the trains they had also askedfor the right to staff the railways in the british zone with French &quot;technical personnel, as had. been doneduring a strike of the German railuayraen a few yearsago.       ^The British Delegates had refused this proposal on the ground that, in the event of consequentialdifficulties, the British troops would be responsible
for the maintenance of order and we should thereby become involved in the support of the Franco-Belgian action in the ruhr, which would be contrary to our declared policy of neutrality and non-intervention,     in announcing this., however,the British Belegatfeo had offered to re-arrange the boundaryox the north-west angle of. the British occupied zone in sucha way as to transfer to the French zone the line of railwayiiBuren-Grevenbroich.     This line, could, then be worked by Frenchtechnical personnel and trains could be run up to the full capacity of the line either for troops, supplies, or reparationscoal, in regard to which the French Belegation had also expressed anxiety.      This proposal had not satisfied the FrenchDelegates who, at the end of two hours discussion, had made anew &quot;proposal that a limitation should be placed on the numberof French troops, and supply trains to be passed through theBritish area in a given time.     The actual proposal before theCabinet was that the number of trains  er day should belimited to the number which had been allowed to pass throughthe British zone for the^maintenance ox the French forces inBuisburg, Ruhrort, etc, prior to January 11th. 1923, and thatthis facility should be given irrespective of the ultimatedestination of the trains., ..-After hearing the views of Captain Georgi,thetechnical adviser&apos;on.railways to the 3ritish High.commissioner in the Rhineland,to the effect that the Germans would probablyaccept the latter proposal and had no ground for objecting tothe proposed re-adjustment of boundaries of the zones, forwhich many precedents, existed, the Cabinet agreed
(a) To approve the action of the British Delegatesin rejecting the original French proposal forthe unrest rioted, use of the railways in theBritish zone by French military trains and forthe manning of these railways by French tech-nical personnel:    also to approve the offer to transfer to the French zone the territorycontaining the Ditren-Grevenbroich railway.(b) That the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should telegraph ins truetidhs to the british ambassador at Berlin to notify the GermanGovernment that the original French proposal had been rejected as inconsistent with our general policy in regard to the Franco-Belgianoperations.,, but that the request for the same number of trains as had been allowed beforeJanuary 11th was deemed reasonable and wouldbe granted, and that German co-operation in working this train service was relied upon by&apos;His Majesty&quot; s Government; also, he should further notify that His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthad agreed to the transfer to the French zone of the territory containing the line Dtfren-Grevenbroich.(e) That the German reply Should be awaited beforenotifying to the French Delegation or Governmentour acceptance of the proposal to allow thesame number of military trains to pass throughthe British zone as had been allowed prior to january 11, 1923.(d) That if no reply had been received from Berlinbefore the meeting arranged for the following morning, the French Delegation should be in-&apos;formedthat His Majesty&apos;s Government were dis-posed to fall in with their wishes but Couldnot give a final answer until they had consultedtheir advisers on the spot.-3-
