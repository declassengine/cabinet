Thereafter British subjects would remain in Russia at their own risk.(g) That, with a view to securing the safe return of the Captain and crew of the Steam Trawler&quot;JAMES JOHNSON&quot;, who are believed to be at murmansk awaiting an opportunity to leave,the following immediate steps should be taken:-(i) The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should telegraph to the british trade Commissioner in Moscow to informthe Russian Soviet Government that theBritish Government proposed to instruct the Captain of a British warship now in north Russian waters to provide facili-ties for the departure of the Captain andcrew of the Trawler &quot;JAMES JOHNSON&quot;fromMurmansk, either in a Sloop or a boat belonging tothe Sloop, or otherwise, and to ask thatthere should be no obstruction by theSoviet authorities:(ii) That the Admiralty should instruct the senior Naval Officer in North Russianwaters to arrange for a Sloop to proceedto the vicinity of Murmansk, with instruc--tions, immediately on receipt of a farthermessage from the Admiralty, to take stepsto bring off the&apos; Captain and crew of the
9 9Steam Trawler * JAMES JOHNSON&quot; either inthe Sloop herself, in one of her steamboats,, in a trawler, or by any availablemeans.(h) That the Home Secretary should arrange tokeep und-?r observation the members of theRussian Trade Delegation, and any otherprominent Russian Bolsheviks, at the expira-tion of the time-limit of ten days from itsreceipt mentioned in the draft.despatch^ inorder that if any attempt should be made to detain the British Trade Mission in Moscowor other British subjects as hostages, suchcorresponding action might be taken here asshould prove feasible.(i) That the Secretary of State for the Colonies^in consultation with the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs, should send a communica-tion to the Dominions in regard to the policy towards Soviet Russia set forth in lord curzon&apos;s despatch.

[This Document is the Property of His Britannic M^jesty-s Government. ]2 3 9Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1923.CONFIDENTIAL. ^\^^f SMEMORANDUM TO BE HANDED TO M. CfflCHERIN.1. THE tone and character of the Notes recently received by the British agent at moscow from the Russian Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, in reply to certainrepresentations made by the former under instructions from His Majesty&apos;s Government,have imposed upon His Majesty&apos;s Government the duty, which has perhaps been alreadytoo long delaved, of considering carefully, and seriatim, in relation to a large number of similar incidents, whether it is desirable, or indeed possible, that the relations of thetwo Governments should remain any longer upon so anomalous and indeed unprecedenteda footing, and whether His Majesty&apos;s Government can with due self-respect continue to ignore the repeated challenges which the Soviet Government has thought fit withapparent deliberation to throw down. His Majesty&apos;s Government have therefore decided that the moment has arrived to address to the Soviet Government a consideredstatement of their views with the desire to arrive at a definite conclusion.&apos;2. It is now just over two years since His Majesty&apos;s Government signed a trade agreement   with  the  Soviet Government, with   a view to  promoting  commercial relations   between  the  two   countries,   the   question   of   political   relations   beingpostponed until the above agreement had been tested in practice, and until theSoviet Government had satisfied  certain indispensable conditions.    In taking this step,   which   was   in   advance   of   any  similar   action   by   any   other   foreign government, His Majesty&apos;s Government not only signified their willingness to establish a friendly understanding with the Russian Government and the Russian people, butthey made a material contribution to the stability and prosperity of the Russian State.At the same time they were careful to prefix to the agreement the stipulation,incumbent upon both parties, to refrain from hostile action or propaganda, the oneagainst the other.   This undertaking, which has been loyally and scrupulously observed by His Majesty&apos;s Government, has from the start been consistently and flagrantlyviolated by the Soviet Government, and correspondence between the two governments in .the autumn and winter of 1 921, which has been published, sufficiently indicated thegrounds of complaint of His Majesty&apos;s Government, as well as the nature of the Russianreply.   After this, there was some slight curtailment of the activities of Russian agents in Asia, the Soviet authorities apparently realising that the Trade Agreement, fromwhich they derived such substantial advantage, might be imperilled by unduly rashconduct.   More recently these pernicious activities have been vigorously resumed.   Itwould be easy to fill many pages with a narrative of these proceedings resting uponunimpeachable authority.   Such a narrative would doubtless provoke, as it did before,an indignant denial from the Soviet Government with allegations as to false information and spurious documents.    His Majesty&apos;s Government have no intention to embark upon any such controversy.    They are content to rely exclusively upon communications which have passed in the last few months between the Russian Government andits agents^ and which are in their possession, and upon the recorded acts of members ofthe Soviet Government itself.3. Among the most fertile fields of Russian anti-British propaganda has always beenthe area which comprises Persia, Afghanistan and the Indian border.I. Persia.4. The Russian Minister at Teheran has been the most tireless, though not always the most successful, operator in this field. He has housed Indian seditionists within his hospitable walls, and has sped them on their mission to India His Majesty&apos;sGovernment know the exact sums which have been sent to him from time to time bythe Russian Government largely for the purpose of anti-British intrigue; and theyhave seen instructions that have passed between him and his superiors, and between him and his subordinate agents, with a view to stirring up anti-British movements andrebellion in that part of the world. The activities of this agent have even extendedto the neighbouring territory of Iraq, and Kermanshah, where there is a Soviet Consul,1525 [9902] B
the instructions to whom are knowm to His Majesty&apos;s Government, has been made the active centre of these benevolent intentions. That these activities are well known to andhave been authorised by the Soviet Government at Moscow is demonstrated by a reportfrom M. Shumiatsky, the Russian representative at Teheran to the Commissariat forForeign Affairs, in February 1923, which contains the following interesting paragraph:&quot; Our Mission in carrying out the instructions which your telegram amplifies, had decided on this political line of action especially in North Persia and Teheran;a good group of workers has been organised who can act in an anti-British directionwith real activity.....    If the Commissary for Foreign Affairs will agree to the plan of the mission, for the first expenditure 300,000 tomans will be necessary as a credit toenable us to work.&quot;II. Afghanistan.5. Afghanistan affords an even more favourable field, of enterprise, owing to itsproximity td:: the Indian border. Here M. Baskolnikov, the Soviet, representative inKabul, has distinguished himself by exceptional zeal. On the 17th February, 1923, hetelegraphed to the Soviet authorities in Tashkent that every possible means shouldbe used &quot;to aggravate the undoubted existing crisis by making a breach betweenAfghanistan;&apos;and the English,&quot; and that &quot;the immediate delivery of arms and moneywouMshave ran immense-significance.&quot; The Russian Commissariat for Foreign affairs will no doubt recognise the following communication dated the 21st February, L923,which they received from M. Raskolnikov : &quot; I am making arrangements for giving help to Waziristan, probably to the extent of the outlay of 3,000 roubles and ten boxes ofcartridges &quot; ; and a further communication dated the 17th March, in which M. Raskolni-k,ov implored the Commissariat not to curtail his work for &quot; Indian work and extraordinaryexpenses,&quot; as. this would cause &quot; an irretrievable loss to the work of the Legation in itsmpst...vital spheres.&quot; These extraordinary expenses for the year October 1922 toOctpber 1923 were estimated by M. Raskolnikov in November 1922 at 800,000 out ofa. total Legation expenditure of&quot;about 1,200,000 Kabul rupees.; :6.,.The Commissariat for Foreign Affairs will also doubtless recognise a communicationreceived by them from Kabul, dated the 8th November, 1922, to the following effect :&quot; Your instructions as regards the caution with which our intelligence and propagandawork should be done are being complied with exactly. Special attention is now being given to the region north of Peshawar, among the Mohmands, but in this respect wecannot do much owing to the insufficiency of funds.&quot;7. Nor will they have -forgotten a communication, dated the ItSth March, 1923,from M. Karakhan, the Assistant Commissary for Foreign. Affairs, to M. Raskolnikov,in which, he said : &quot; Bring with you a concrete proposal with regard to the form theco-operation in assisting the tribes should take. On the settlement of this question will depend the question of the delivery of arms. Please inform us of your ideas as tothe form of co-operation necessary to ensure local supervision in the distribution ofthe arms.&quot;8. These communications throw an interesting light on some recent events in theIndian Borderland.III. India.9. M. Baskolnikov has also not failed to cast his eye across the Indian border.Already in November 1922 seven Indians who had been trained as Communistagitators at Tashkent and, after the conclusion of the Russian Trade Agreement, at moscow, were arrested on their arrival in India from Moscow whence they hadtravelled under the charge of Prussian civil and military officials by a circuitous and very difficult route, in order to avoid detection.10. In the same year a number of Bank Notes of 100/. each, issued through LloydsBank and the Russian Commercial and Industrial Bank in London to Nikolai Klishko,Assistant Official Agent of the Soviet Government in London in June 1921, werecashed in India on behalf of a revolutionary Panjabi in touch with other Indianseditionaries who are known to have been closely associated with the Russianrepresentative in Kabul.11. In the light of these incidents it is not surprising to learn that in a recentcommunication to M. Karakhan, M. Raskolnikov thus expressed himself: &quot; I consider It most important to maintain personal touch with and render at least the minimumamount of assistance to Indian revolutionaries. At the very lowest it is necessary to assign at least 25,000 gold roubles.   Failing this the existing organisation will collapse.&quot;
. 12, In their note of the; 7th September, 1921, the Soviet Government indignantlyrepudiated any connection between themselves and the mischievous body known as,the Third,International. It is singularly unfortunate, if this be the case, that a memberof the Soviet Government, M. : Sokolnikov, ,people&apos;s Commissary for Finance, and presumably a responsible official, should at a meeting of the Financial Coinmission of theFourth Congress of the Third International held at Moscow on the 25th November, 1922,have been one of the body of three by whom the sums of 8O,O0OL and 120,000Z. wereallotted to-the British and Indian Communist parties respectively. Of this sum 75,000Z.had arrived: in England by the beginning of January , 1923. A. little earlier, inSeptember, 1922, the Soviet. Government had borne the; expense of equipping anddespatching to India and other Eastern ; countries&apos;62 Oriental students trained , in propaganda schools under the Third International. - ... \13. The above paragraphs contain but a fevv. selected examples.among many scores of-similar incidents, covering in their wide ambit Egypt, Turkey, the British Dominions,and even Great Britain, which testify to. the consistent manner in which the SovietGovernment has flouted-and infringed the preliminary condition upon which the trade agreement was signed. , It is: clearly impossible that an arrangement should beperpetuated, which is faithfully observed by one party and as systematically/-violatedby the other. &quot; Unless such acts, are, repudiated and apologised for, and: unless the officials, who-have been.- responsible: for.them are disowned and recalled from; the scene of their maleficent, labours,;it is manifestly impossible to persevere with an&apos;agreement which is so cue-sided in its operation. ;  .    . * .- &apos;IV. - Outrages on British Subjects.14. Nor do these cases stand alone. They have been accompanied or supplemented bya series of outrages inflicted Upon British subjects in the past few years, for which noapology.has been offered and no compensation given. The most conspicuous of thesecases. are the murder . of Mr. C. F. Davison, in January 1920, and the arrest and.imprisonment on a false charge.of Mrs. Stan Harding in the summer of the same year.A prolonged correspondence has taken place on both of these subjects and- has been.publisned in both countries. It has produced the most painful impression in the british parliament and in the Press of this county, where public opinion is at a loss to under-. stand, how such treatment as that accorded to these unfortunate and innocent persons should be meted out by a Government to which the British Government has gone outof its way to extend a friendly hand, or how the latter Government can consistently with its own dignity and with the adequate protection of legitimate British interestsacquiesce in the continuance of such a scandal. . .,; 15. As to the case of Mr. Davison, His Majesty&apos;s Government in their Memorandumof the 25th January, 1922, requested to be allowed to examine the record of theevidence brought before the Russian Court by which he was condemned to be shot,and insisted on the payment of full compensation to his widow. Neither of these demands was granted, but a number of irrelevant and easily refutable charges were brought by the Soviet Government against the British authorities in reply. HisMajesty&apos;s Government cannot acquiesce in so impotent and unjust a conclusion.16. In the case of Mrs. Stan Harding, the details of which are well known throughoutthe world, and have elicited but one opinion in all civilised countries, a similar demandfor compensation to the injured lady was made by His Majesty&apos;s Government and wassimilarly rejected by the Soviet Government.17. In both these cases His Majesty&apos;s Government are unable any longer to triflewith the matter. They must now require that the Soviet Government should admittheir liability and should undertake to pay such equitable compensation as may be awarded by an arbitrator to be agreed upon by His Majesty&apos;s Government and theSoviet Government, or failing such agreement, by the President of the international court of Justice at The Hague, or by some other impartial person of similar standing.18. The demand for compensation in these cases is without prejudice to any other claims that may be made by, or on behalf of, other British subjects, many of whichhave been notified to His Majesty&apos;s Government, or by the Russian Government onits own behalf. The manner in which these claims should be dealt with is a legitimatematter for discussion. -    A .&apos;   :,       ; V. Treatment of British Trawlers.    ,19. The feelings aroused in this country by the above treatment of British subjects,^iwithout justification, and so far without redress, has been greatly aggravated during[9902] B 2
the past year by a series of acts perpetrated by the Russian authorities in contravention of the generally accepted conventions of international law, and involving a whollyindefensible interference with British shipping arid acts of indignity against Britishsubjects. Prolonged correspondence has taken place upon the arrest of the steamtrawler &quot; Magneta,&quot; while fishing about 9 miles off the Murman coast on the31st January, 1922, the trawler, while under Soviet compulsion, being subsequentlywrecked and the crew of ten men drowned ; and also upon the arrest &quot;of the steamtrawler &quot; St. Hubert&quot; on the 3rd March, 1922, when fishing more than 12 milesfrom the coast, that vessel being confiscated by the Soviet authorities and being stilldetained in the harbour at Murmansk. The reiterated demands of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment for the admission of liability and the grant of compensation in these two cases have been persistently refused by the Soviet Government. More recently, anotherflagrant case has occurred, the steam trawler &quot;James Johnson &quot; having been seized in thepresent month while fishing in the same waters, the vessel and the catch confiscated bythe Soviet Government and the master condemned to a month&apos;s imprisonment withhard labour. .        .if20. It is&apos;time that the Soviet Government should be made aware that it cannot withimpunity behave towards British subjects and British shipping in this arbitrary andintolerable manner. His Majesty&apos;s Government are compelled to insist upon (a) thegrant of compensation to the owners and relatives for the loss of the &quot; Magneta &quot; andthe death of the crew; (b) the release of the &quot;St. Hubert&quot; and &quot; James Johnson,&quot; asweir as the crew of the latter, with the grant of suitable compensation ; and (c) an assurance that British fishing vessels will not be interfered with in future outside the3-mile limit..i       , VI.-Return of Notes relating to Religious Persecution.21. During the past year a series of events have occurred in Russia1 involving the trial,the condemnation, and, in more than one case, the execution of prominent Russianecclesiastics, occupying a high place in the hierarchy of the Orthodox or Catholic&quot;churches inthat country. In July 1922 the Metropolitan Benjamin of Petrograd and&quot;ten other priests were tried and condemned&apos;to death, and, it is believed, executed foropposing the confiscation of church property. At the end of March 1923 ArchbishopCieplak and Mgr. Butkevitch, the leading Roman Catholic prelates in Russia, weretried for alleged acts of hostility to the Soviet Government, and were condemned, theformer to 10 years&apos; solitary confinement and the latter to death, the sentences beingduly carried out. The Catbolicos of Georgia and the Bishop of Kutais, in theCaucasus, are under arrest in Tiflis and awaiting trial. The Patriarch Tikhon, of theRussian Orthodox Church, was in May 1922 placed under close arrest and is shortly tobe tried (the. trial having apparently been only temporarily postponed) on a charge of counter-revolutionary activity.22. His Majesty&apos;s Government have refrained from expressing an opinion&apos;upon thenature or validity of the charges brought against these ecclesiastics, conceiving thatthat is a matter oh which they are not called upon to pronounce. No attempt,however, is made in Russia itself to deny that these prosecutions and executions arepart of a deliberate campaign undertaken by the Soviet Government, with the definite&apos; object of destroying all religion in Russia, and enthroning the image of godlessness in its place. As such they have excited the profound consternation and have provoked theindignant remonstrance of the civilised world. When Mgr. Butkevitch was sentenced to death, appeals were made to the Soviet Government from Governments and&quot;religious bodies in many countries. It was in sympathy with this outburst of theaffronted moral sentiment of mankind that on the 30th March the British representative at Moscow, acting under insfructions from His Majesty&apos;s Government, approachedM. Chicherin with a &quot;submission that the execution of the sentence cannot fail toproduce throughout the civilized world a feeling of horror and indignation whichthe Russian Government can hardly wish to invite&quot; and &quot;with an earnest and final appeal to that Government for a stay of execution.&quot; On the following dayMr. Hodgson received a reply signed by M. Weinstein claiming the undeniable rightof Russia to pass sentences in conformity with its own laws, and declaring that&quot;every attempt from outside to interfere with this right and to protect spies anditraitors in Russia is an unfriendly act.&quot; Further, M. Weinstein proceeded in thesame letter to make an irrelevant and insulting reference to a communication receivedby M. Chicherin from the alleged representative of a so-called Irish Republic in France.tThis note, unexampled in the case of Governments affecting to be on friendly termfi,
5was at once and rightly returned by Mr. Hodgson, at the same time that he repudiated^all desire to interfere with the right of the Russian Government to exercise jurisdictionwithin its own territory. On the 24th April Mr. Hodgson received a further reply from M. Weinstein couched in terms even more offensive.   Mr. Hodgson returned no-answer. But the Soviet Government, in accordance with a practice which usage hasnow rendered familiar, published the correspondence to the world.23. It must be clear that the exchange of correspondence conducted by one of thetwo parties in the above temper and language is not merely inconsistent with that^standard of courtesy which ordinarily prevails in the relations between Governments,but places the continuance of those relations in grave jeopardy. When further it isremembered that this is only the latest incident in the long series of studied affrontswhich have been recorded in this Memorandum, it seems difficult to arrive at any other-conclusion than that the Soviet Government are either convinced that His Majesty&apos;s&quot;Government, will accept any insult sooner than break with Soviet Russia, or that they desire themselves to bring the relations created by the Trade Agreement to an end.24. His Majesty&apos;s Government would on general grounds, and in the interest of theeconomic recovery of a country with whose people (as they have recently-had many-opportunities of testifying in a practical way) they have genuine ties of sympathy and old alliance, much regret that an abrupt termination should be made to. an experimentwhich was entered into by them in sincerity, and has been pursued with undeviatingloyalty and good faith. But it is not possible for them to acquiesce in a continuance ofthe treatment which has been summarised in this Memorandum and which is incompatiblealike with national dignity and with mutual respect.25. In the above Note have been stated the requests which His Majesty&apos;s Government-feel constrained to make.   They are requests for : 1. The actions and assurances by the Soviet Government with regard to propaganda and hostile action which are contained in para. L3.2. The admission of liability by the Soviet Government and the undertaking topay compensation in the case of the British subjects and the&apos; British shipsas demanded in paras. 17 and 20. &apos;-3. The unequivocal withdrawal of the two communications signed by M. Weinsteinwhich have been described in para. 22.To Mr. Hodgson.You should forward this Memorandum to the Soviet Government and should inform them that His Majesty&apos;s Government have no desire or intention to enter into a prolonged and possibly acrimonious controversy on any of these subjects ; but that unless within ten days of the time at which, your communication is received by theCommissariat for Foreign Affairs the Soviet Government has undertaken to complyfully and unconditionally with the requests which it contains, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment will recognise that that Government do not wish the existing relations betweenthe two Governments to be maintained.In that case it must be considered that notice of the termination of the trade agreement, as provided for in the terms of the Agreement itself, will have been given at the time when the ten days will have expired ; and no alternative will be left to youbut to request the Soviet Government for facilities for the immediate return of yourself,your Mission, and Mr. Preston to this country.C. op K.o

It was agreed that no such liability could possibly be assumed be the British Government, but the fact that they had no liability for the payment of compensation did not ? them from the responsibility of assisting persona who had suffered owing to their loyalty to the Crown.
