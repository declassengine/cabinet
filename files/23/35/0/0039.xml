t G RE T.BRITISH secretary MOTES Off AH^ Mjf IflEBIiVIBW i-T VILLA V&amp;LBTTA. MS,OB &apos;WEDNESDAY,  JANUARY 4th,  1922,at 6*45 p.a.PRESENT:GREAT BRITAIN. ITALY.The Bt? Hon. B. Lloyd George,0-M.,M.Pi,       Signor Bonomi.Mr. T. Jones . ...... British Secretary.Signor Buti ........ Interpreter.
Mr.   Lloyd George, after wo looming Signor Bonomisaid it was desirable that ho should examine the suggestionsput forward as the result of the Conference with M. BriandIn London before they were presented on Friday.     They weresuggestions for discussion and not a formal agreement.Sigmor 3on&amp;ml asked If Italy would get anything in kind or in specie.-   Mr, Lloyd George *     We shall be put in a worse position this year if the suggestions fero carried out.We wes^s prepared for that In of&amp;es? to help PraaeeoSignor Bonomi said ho vjotild fee mmh interested to learn if the suggestions were going to help to salvageEastern europe sad Germany.     Aooordlag to the Press reports,Gormany was to pay 500,000,000 gold marks.     Would not thatembarrass Germany?Mr. Lloyd $sorgo.     It Would help1 Germany indi*eetly*He was anxious that the pro sent Conference should be muchmore than a Conference on Separations.     It should aim atsetting Europe on its feet again;   that was the mostimportant task before them.-Signor Bonomi said that on that point he was infull agreement with Mr. Lloyd George.     They both shared the same ideas in regard to Germany and Russia.     Bethwanted to put the vanquished In a position to comply withthe conditions of the Treaty.-Mr. Lloyd George said it was important to remember that before the war Germany was more dependent than therest of Europe for trade on Russia and the Eastern Statesand unless that trade was restored, Germany could notfulfil her obligations under the Treaty.     His own view^i-s that there should be an Economic Conference tc whiehall represent at I-gc of        leading countries of Europe,including/
including Russia, should be summoned. At present the method of working through an agent in London who had constantly to consult Moscow, was most unsatisfactory and made progress very slow. We were impotently looking on upon Russia striken with famine and with thousands dying. It was much better to endeavour to arrange a European Conference of the responsible leaders of the Allies, who would meet the responsible leaders of Russia, Germany and Austria to consider the reconstruction of Europe, instead of a Conference of experts like that held at Brussels.

Signor Bonomi agreed but was inclined to doubt whether France would share theses ideas. Italy had not formally recognised Russia but was on the way to doing so.

Mr. Lloyd George emphasised the fact that the Conference would be an economic rather than a diplomatic Conference, It would make suggestions for reconstruction involving certain measures of control. e.g. over Railways. Such measures would be unwelcome to the Russians and they would demand full diplomatic recognition. We should then be able to say that on conditions we would grant the recognition asked for. These conditions would include, -

(1) Recognition by the the Russian Government of obligations to pay national debts, including those incurred under the Czarist r√©gime;

(2) Compensation for damage to our nationals;

(3) The impartial treatment in Russian Courts of any now investments made as a result of the Conference.

Broadly, what these conditions amount to was a guarantee of security for trade and industry.

Signor Bonomi said that substantially the Italian Government had made a declaration on similar lines with the addition of a condition dealing with the return of prisoners.


UB LLOYD GEORGE said that he thought Prance would heinfluenced by what Great Britain was prepared to do in theraatter of guarantees for her security.    The joint guarantee,with the United States of America of June 1919 had fallenthrough.    If now Great Britain were alone to give a guarantee of assistance to Prance in tho event of unprovoked aggressionbjr Germany, it would be on tho distinct condition that Prancewas prepared to march with Great Britain and Italy to thereconstruction of Central Europe and Russia,SIGPOR BOBOkl:      &quot;It would not be an Alliance?&quot;MR LLOYD GEORGE:      &quot;No,     We could not enter into an exclusive alliance with Prance and leave Italy out.   british public opinion is too friendly to Italy to allow that;&quot;Sigouri BOBOMI. said that he heard that assurance with much pleasure as an exclusive alliance would have a bad reaction in Italy.Reverting to the Question of reparations and to the recent discussions in London between the British and French, SignorBonorai said he gathered that neither England or Italy would receive anything.   A bad impression would be made in Italy unlessall the Allies were called upon to bear sacrifices, Prance andBelgium included.   He did not want to enter into details buthe understood that out of the payment of 500,000,000 goldmarks to be made by Germany in 1922, England and Prance wouldbe paid for their armies of occupation and Belgium would receive her priority claims.   He wished to remind Mr LloydGeorge that Italy had an army of occupation in Austria.MR LLOYD GDORGE pointed out that Germany had hot agreedto pay for it.   There had been solidarity between the Allies inthe matter of reparations, but not in the matter of payment forthe armies of occupation.    Great Britain had never been paid for the troops in Turkey.SIGNOH BOBOMI said that he thought the position had been changed by the agreement of august 13th 1921, and that the
French army of occupation was going to he pMcroditod with;.h.o value of the Saaa* basin.MR LLOYD GEORGE said that he was not familiar with all thedetails of the August agreement which Signor Bonomi had betterdiscuss with Sir Robert Horne, but he believed the agreement had not been ratified.SIGNOR B080MX replied that the failure to ratify the august agreement had a bad effect in Italy.   He was anxious tostrengthen the good-will between England, France and his ownandcountry,    ; if he went back empty handed he would be bitterlycriticised.MS LLOYD GEORGE said that British public opinion was alsoirritated with.Prance on the question of submarines,   if prancepersisted in her policy of buildihg submarines Great britain would have to build anti-submarine craft.    There was this to besaid fcr Prance that her richest province had been devastated, andthe damage had not yet been repaired.SIGNOR BONOMI said he freely acknowledged that Prance had suffered the&apos; severest damage, but if Prance with her large army, went in for a big naval policy, while Italy retained anarmy and navy of a negligible sise, Italian publicopinion would be full of resentmenti   Italy would not mind if all the Allies alike, Prance and Belgium included, had to reduce their claims upon Germany.    Italian business men were much concerned to avoid making such demands upon Germany as would lead her to print more paper money and drive the value of the mark still further down.MR LLQYB GEORGE pointed out that the proposal was to giveher four months in whioh to pay the 500 millions and that she should also be given a guarantee that she would not be molestedfor the rest of the year.     That sense of security would tend*
to improve the value of the mark. Further, her position would be helped by the fact of her co-operating with the other powers in the task of industrial reconstruction.

In conclusion Kr Lloyd George stated that he had discussed the question of the guarantee to France and of the economic Conference with L Briand. No agreement had been reached and it was important that nothing should be said about these matters to the public at this stage.  He would like if Signor Bonomi would consider the suggestions which had been discussed in London and in Paris and he suggested that they should resume their conversation on Thursday at 6.0 p.m. In the meantime Signor Bonomi would have an opportunity of discussing reparations with Sir Robert Horne, M. Loucheur, and M. Theunis at the Conference arranged for Thursday morning at 11.30.

Signor Bonomi agreed to these arrangements.
