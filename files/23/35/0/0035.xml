that the less useful members of the british service should not be got rid of by sending themto Ulster.     He asked in particular for theservices of Mr,Watts of the Admiralty andMr.A.T*?. BoMnaon from, he believed, the Ministryof Transport.The Prime Minister said it was a matter of concern not only to northern Ireland, but equally to the United Kingdom as a whole, that the Govern-ment of northern Ireland should have a fair start with an efficient civil service, and he.undertook&apos;to speak in this sense to the Chancellor of theExchequer.Sir   James Craig thanked the.

CLEG,STATE VISIT10 BELFAST BY THEVICEROY.b.     The Prime   Minister said that, as the resultof a long conversation with several of his colleaguesincluding Sir Hamar Greenwood, as well as with sir. -James craig, at and after luncheon, he had come to the conclusion that the Cabinet ought toadvise the Ming to go to Belfast to open the new parliament in person, provided he was invited bythe new executive.     He thought that the Mingshould also be advised to express his willingness to open the Parliament of Southern Ireland-H&apos;   invited by the executive.     The Prime ministers aid that he himself had been induced by the strong arguments brought forward to alter hie originalpoint of view, which had been opposed to a Stateopening by the King, on the ground that it might give an impression of partisanship if His Majestyopened the Northern but not the Southern IrishParliament,She Prime Minister undertook to speak tolord Stamfordhara on the subject,6,     Sir James Craig said that the Viceroy wouldbe glad to have the Prime Minister&quot;s advice as towhether it would be advisable for him to pay aState visit to Belfast on June 7th on the .occasion of the first assembly of the Parliament Of SorthernIreland, for the. transaction of formal business,such as the taking of the oath, election of a speaker, ete*     It seemed desirable that theViceroy should pay his first State visit in con-nection with so important an event as the bringing into being of this new Parliament.     If, however,he postponed his visit until the State opening bythe Ming, his. visit would be altogether over-shadowed in importance by the.
