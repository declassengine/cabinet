Prime Minister&apos;s Statement in the Houseef Commons, November 15th, 1919.THE PRIME MINISTERS    I am answering all thequestions together.     It is impossible to answer themseparately because they run into each other and some ofthem cover exactly the same ground.     As to the question in regard to the so-called peace advances from theSoviet Republic, the Allied Governments have always de-clined to take any action on communications which purported to come from the Governments of hostile countries throughirresponsible agencies.      They have only acted on commun-modifications coming officially and directly from suchGovernments.      That has been the practice of the Alliesduring the War, and events have fully  justified it.      TheGovernment do not think it advisable to depart from thatpractice now.In reply to the question asked by my hon. and gallantFriend the Member for Barnstable, I wish to state cate-gorically that no person has at any time on my behalf or with my knowledge interviewed representatives of theBolsheviks for the purpose of ascertaining whether , and upon what terms negotiations for peace might be opened.I have never agreed with what I may call theNorthcliffe policy, explained by its author earlier gbhisyear that the world powers should sink their pride for a mount and get into communication with the Bolsheviks, andthat we should employ an avowed English Bolshevik sympath-iser for.that purpose.      In my judgement that certainly isnot the method by which peace can be secured in Russia.In reply to the question put by my Noble friend the Member for Hitchin, first of all, as to the presentposition of Admiral Koltchak and the administrative andmilitary causes of his retirement.      The position in western Siberia is undoubtedly grave.      The Bolshevikforces are marching rapidly on Omsk, but the KoltchakArmies
Armies have not evacuated that town, and its fate willhe decided by the battles that are to be fought in thecourse of the next few days in front of the city.     As tothe causes of the retirement,  they are rather too corn-plicated to give in answer toaa question.      But it illus-trates the aspect of the Russian Civil war which I venturedto emphasise on Saturday - its abnormally sY/aying character.Early in the year Admiral Koltchak&apos;s Army had crossed theUrals and advanced beyond Perm and a junction with general denikin in the South and the Archangel forces in thenorth was regarded as imminent, whilst an advance to moscow before the winter seemed quite within the limits of practicability.     At that time General Denikin was only just holding his own in a limited territory on the easternshores of the Black Sea.     How Admiral Koltchak has re-treated 660 miles and General Denikin has swept theBolshevik Armies from a vast and fertile region coveringthousands of sqare miles.     Within the last few v/eeks hehas lost some ground:, but he still holds by far the greaterportion of the recovered territory.      We are far too apt to examine the fight in Russia in the light of our experience of the great struggle in France.      There an army of the size of General Denikin&apos;s or of that of hisBolshevik foes would hold a front of a little over fiftymiles with well-organised communications behind.      Here,such an Army has to hold a front of 1,300 miles, with avast country behind thoroughly disorganised, often over-run by marauding bands who temporarily capture and lootgreat cities in the recovered territotire.      The vast majority of the population feel no ardent loyalty for either side and very quickly change their allegiance.      There isthe further complication of provincial or national move-merits like Petlura&apos;s.      The result is that General Denikinhas not so far been able to establish administrativecontrol
control over the conquered territories.      That makestrade in this very important region for the supply offood and raw material for the present almost imp rac tits able.I might also add that the absorption of the railwayequipment in the supply of the Armies adds to thedifficulty.It is the policy of the Government to open up tradeand commerce as much as possible with South Russia,  in theinterest not only of Russia but of the world.     We havemade special efforts in that direction during the last few months, and the hon. Member for the CamlachieDivision of Glasgow - a well-known and able Member of this house - has been appointed to go on a special mission to South Russia with the object of, amongst other things,investigating what can be done in these reapects, and ofgenerally advising the Government on the position.As regards general policy,  the Government have re-peatedly stated this in the House.      I stated it in some detail in the month of April.      More recently it has been explained to the House of Commons by&apos; my right hon. FrienflThe Secretary if State for War and by my right hon.Friend the   Chancellor of the Exchequer in his writtenand financial statements.     From the policy thus enun-ciated the Government have no intention of departing.As has been explained, between the date of the armistice and the end of October, in cash and in kind, the valueof nearly  100,000,000 has been spent or sanctioned bythe United Kingdom on account of assistance sent toRussia.     A substantial part of this sum has been, orwill be, added to the permanent indebtedness of thiscountry.      The Government has repeatedly made it clear to the House of Commons that with the crushing financial burden already cast upon it by the Grat War, it cannotcontemplate
contemplate the assumption of new obligations under this head.     As the Chancellor of the Exchequer explained inthe White Paper and in his speech, there is no provision made for such additional expenditure in Russia.      Ifan addition is to he made to the national obligations under this head,  it will be the responsibility of theHouse of Commons to determine the additional taxationthat shall be imposed for the purpose.On the other hand, the Government have an over-whelming sense of the importance of bringing peace toRussia.     Not only is Russia a source of unrest anddisturbance to all its neighbours, with all the infinitepossibilities for mischief which lurk in such a conditionover so far an area, but a settlement of the Russianproblem is essential to the reconstruction of the world.Russia is one of the great resources for the supply offood and raw material.      The present condition in russia is one of the contributing causes of the present high prices, and high prices are undoubtedly in all landsthe most dangerous form of Bolshevik propaganda.      Thereare also many indications that German reactionaries areusing the present strike in Russia to strengthen their influence with all the struggling parties alike in thatcountry, and I have no doubt that if the strugglecontinues, the military party in Germany will secure agreat hold in Russia through the medium of the verynumerous bodies of demobilised officers and nen-commissioned officers out of work, who will find readyemployment in that country if the war proceeds.      from the humanitarian point of view it is no less important in the opinion of the Government that civil war, which isnot only destroying the economic life in Russia and thusimpoverishing the world, but it is slowly decimating itsinert and helpless population, should be brought to anend
end as soon as possible.That is why the Government have always &quot;been ready to take any reasonable opportunity which may present itself to effectsettlement of the Russian question on conditions which will rebring peace and good order and constitutional governmentto Russia, on terms which are acceptable to the Russian people themselves.      Their views on this subject were embodied in theAllied letter to Admiral Koltchak.     &quot;It is proposed to hold,I hope, at early date, an International Conference atwhich Ministers of the Allied and Associated Powers will consider the various grave and outstanding problems whichthe Peace Conference has so far been unable to settle forone reason or another.      Russia will be amongst these problems.      If the House of Commons wishes to have a discussion of the Russian question before the assembly of this conference, the Government will, of course, be prepared togive the necessary facilities.      But I would respectfullysuggest before the demand Is made that Members should bearin mind that in a difficult and delicate matter of this kindit is not always the best plan to have a public debate in which the Government may be forced in support of itsviews to give publicity to information   on matters connectedwith the position in Russia - information which hasinfluenced their judgement on policy.      The House ofcourse, may rest assured that trie Government will inaugurateno new policy and commit the country to no fresh action without giving the House the fullest opportunity of discussing it.
