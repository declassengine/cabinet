It therefore declared on March 23rd at Councilin London that simultaneous occupation of Frankfort andDarmstadt must in any case be condition of giving permission to Germany*   On April 1st French President of Councilannounced in a conversation with British Ambassador and repeated by telegraph on same day to French ambassador in London that he would do nothing without having warned andconsulted Allies,   He made his acts conform to.his words,On April 3rd he addressed a telegram to French representative in London, Rome, Brussels, Tokio and Washington giving text of his letter of even date to German Charge d&apos;Afiaires inParis
Paris and adding : BI have no doubt &quot;but that Governmentto which you are accredited will appreciate as I donecessity of immediate action and will he ready to lendFrench Government its effective cooperation^,   MarshalPoch is studying the military measures which can nowno longer he avoided nor postponedn0   In order.to ensurethat this telegram should reach Government to which itwas addressed in good time President of Council communicatedcopies to all the Allied Embassies in Paris on April 3rdat 7 p0mo   French Government was therefore fully justifiedin declaring repeatedly that it had taken the greatest care to warn and consult its Allies0   Question at issue indivergence of views which has just arisen between Cabinetsof London and Paris is application of ono of most solemnclauses of a Treaty signed by France and Great Britain.That Treaty states in precise terms the policy which Franceand Great Britain have undertaken to pursue with a viewto solidarity in defending not only their special interests,but also higher and permanent interests of civil!zation6France has never wavered in this policy^   I do not wishto insist on fact that dignity of French Government (group undecypherable) but I am not to be (group undecypherable)uy German Government breaking word spontaneously givenby it to French Government;   the Berlin Government had \indeed declared that in no case would it allow supplementary.German troops to enter Ruhr Basin without previous assent of Francs,   Let us examine question from a higher stand-point,   As regards very heart of matter iBe* question as to whether French Government was justified in occupyingFrankfort
Frankfort and Darmstadt I feel bound to recall factthat German Government had spontaneously recognized (1)that in no case Reichswehr should be sent Into RuhrBasin without previous and formal authority of AlliedPowers:   (2) that French Government could rightly claim   iterritorial pledge for this.deviation from Article 43of Treaty of Versailles:   finally German Governmentpromised to withdraw Reichswehr as soon as order had been-established in Ruhr Basin.   This promise could notsuffice in eyes of French Government,,   What proof hasGerman Government given of good faith in executing Treatyof Versailles?   It would be too long to recite all theviolations of Treaty during last few weeks,   I&apos; would only mention that Allies have not received satisfactionin accordance with Treaty stipulations either respectingreparation for damages nor as to delivery of criminals,supplies of coal, nor disarmament of army.   It must be recalled too that after systematic destruction of Frenchmines in Nord and Pas de Calais, French economic lifedepends on supply of German coal due to her.   Maintenanceon French and Belgian frontiers of military forces and armaments which according to Versailles Treaty should nolonger exist is standing threat to their security^   Belgiumhas shown like France that she realizes danger and hasnobly affirmed her solidarity by despatching a contingent to join French troops occupying Frankfort and Darmstadtuntil German troops shall have evacuated neutral zone.Do not British Government measure danger of these successiveand
and systematic violations?   When will they call a haltto Germany?   If they do not do so France must, hut she-wishes to do so with all herN Allies.   Amongst declarationsmade to me &quot;by Lord Derby I note particularly this one.&quot;It is essential Id opinion of His Maiesty(s Governmentto maintain unity of Alliescas regards application of treaty with Germany *   Such is also the firm conviction ofFrench Government,   But it is not only as regards germany that unity appears to French Government necessary,   none of vast problems now pending can properly be solved withoutintimate and cordial cooperation of France and GreatBritain.   Grave difficulties which constantly come to light in Russia, in Balkans, in Asia Minor and throughoutIslam render it more than ever necessary that Paris and -London Cabinets should have mutual and unlimited -confidence in one another.   Due regard being given to above considara-tions French Government do not hesitate to declare thatin all Inter-Allied questions which execution of Treatyraises they do not contemplate any case in which theywill not be happyj before acting5 to assure themselves of assent of their Allis&apos;s3(10,4   8/4).

(D)e........ ...OOQOOOOOO&apos;Your telegram No. 449 (of April 9th G)I request Your Excellency to make without delay toMonsieur Millerand communication to the following effect and to hand him a copy.&quot;The reply of the French Government commences with anarration of the events which have led to the unfortunatemisunderstanding between the French Government and theAllies,   His Majesty&apos;s Government foar that they cannot accept this narration as being a complete or accurate statementof the factsa Ibthing however will be gained by a discussion on those details at this stage as the question at issue is sufficiently clear 0   It has nothing to do with the clauses of the Treaty relating to reparation, delivery of war criminals, coal supplies and disarmament, Tho Fjrehch Govorn-ment did not take independent action on these questions, andit would not have been necessary for them to do so, inasmuch as they knew from categorical statements made at the supreme council and in the British Parliament that His Majesty &apos;sGovernment were perfectly ready not only to discuss thesematters but to take the necessary action in concert withtheir Allies to enforce performance of its obligations byGermany,   To those declarations His Majesty&apos;s Governmentadhere.There
There were two issues and two issues only in the presentcases   The first of these was whether the German Governmentshould be permitted to restore order in a disturbed area intheir own country with the only means which were availableto them.   The Allied Governments, and at one period theFrench Government.were prepared to grant this permission;.&apos;but they differed absolutely as to the conditions to beattached to it0The second issue, arising out of the condition proposedby the French Government was whether Allied troops or alternatively French troops, should occupy other parts ofGermany, far removed from the Ruhr, either as a condition of,or in answer to, the entry of German forces into the Ruhr *The Allies were unanimously opposed to such an occupation.Thereupon the French Government decided to act independently *His Majesty&apos;s Government note with satisfaction thedeclaration with which the note concludes that the FrenchGovernment do not contemplate any case in the future in whichthey will not be happy to assure themselves of the assent of the Allies.

nevertheless free themselves to follow it *   His Majesty&apos;sGovernment must say definitely that they cannot accept thisview, which is incompatible with the entire spirit uponwhich the alliance has hitherto been maintained, and that,until there is a complete understanding on this point, theBritish Ambassador in Paris cannot attend meetings of aConference which exists to concert Allied measures forthe enforcement of the Treaty.Repeated to Berlin Ho. 115, Rome No, 128, and Brussels
(This Document is tho Property of His Britannic Majesty !sGovernment,  and should he returned tti the Jo reign Office if notrequired for official use.)FRANCE.POLITICAL,Cypher telegram to Lord Derby (Paris).Foreign Office.   10 th. April, 1920 .   11.0 p jn .No . 437 .    (D) .In my telegram No . 436 of to-day I have stated that wecannot accept French narrative as a complete or accuratestatement of the facts.   It would he too long for a telegram to demonstrate the first of these propositions, hut the inaccuracycan easily he proved by the following statement, which you areat liberty to use in conversation with Monsieur Millersnd ifyou think: fit .1 .     The French Note states that French Governmentdeclared on March 23rd at Council in London that simultaneousoccupation of Frankfort and Darmstadt must in any case hecondition of giving permission to Germany.   This is not thecase.   First hint of proposed occupation of other parts ofGermany than Ruhr was made to you by M. Millerend on March 21stand contained no mention of Frankfort or Darmstadt (yourtelegram No . 336) .   At the Council in London on 22nd (not 23rd)I mentioned the proposal, of which French Ambassador had notheard,  and which he discredited.   It was, however, discussed and unanimously disapproved of &quot;by Allied representatives ,Counter proposals were put forward Toy us as described in my  :telegram No. 373.    See also concluding words of this telegram in which I stated .that    &quot;His Majesty!s Government cannot consent in
in existing circumstances to any proposals to send allied forces into Germany11 ,   On March. 23rd,  first mention of Frankfortand Darmstadt was made by K, Millerand to you and reported by you to me (your telegram &apos;Mo . 343) .   We discussed it in allied conference the next day (March 24th) and it was unanimouslyrejected.2.     The Prench Note states that on April 1st M. Millerandtold you that he would do nothing without having warned andconsulted the Allies a   This is very different from thedeclaration as reported &quot;by you in your telegram No . 396 of thatdate,  and from the statements twice made &quot;by Prench ambassador to mc here, which were that Prench Government would not actwithout the consent of the Allies ,3,     French Note states that Prench Government had taken the greatest care to warn and consult their Allies bycommunicating to Allied Embassies in Paris on night of April3rd Prench reply to German Charge d &quot;Affaires, which had beenforwarded to Prench representatives abroad,  indicating that marshall Foch was studying military measures which could no longer&quot;be avoided or postponed.   Prench reply,  telegraphed to us from paris, did not roach Foreign Office till afternoon of April 4th,$aster Sunday.   On April 5th. it was officially read by PrenchAmbassador to Mr. Bonar Paw who reiterated British and Alliedobj elections ,Nevertheless on same day before any reply from us hadbeen or could have been received, M. Millerand admitted in conversation with Sir G. Grahame (Sir G. Grahame &apos;s telegramWo    421) that orders had already been given for advance of Prenchtroops because Prench Government had had no reply from Allies and could not wait.   At same interview Sir G, Grahame imploredFrench Government not to take precipitate action and impressed upon
upon them deplorable effect of isolated proceeding .   onmorning of April 6th the occupation took place .These facts show that Trench contentions in note now under examination cannot be sustained.
