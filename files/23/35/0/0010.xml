Tho kinistur of food had boon of opinion that tnc movement was revolutionary*****    ill
in character-. -^TTSr^CTaa^^^ oormi lariatarrangements though the So-operative Societies.   The greateststress was laid on the inadequacy of the military forces avail-able in the United Kingdom for dealing with a development.    in whole of Scotland,  fo- example, the available infantry was stated by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff to amount onlyto two battalions, and in the north of England to three battal-ions, after the departure of the battalions destined for Germany,Poland, India and Egypt.    The rest of the Army consisted of un-trained war levies.    Further, unless the Government could makeau**e of be in? able to wo h the railways and the electric light and powe&quot; stations, which was at present doubtful, the situation would be ve ry d ange roua .This weakness was aggravated by the fact that the measuresoriginally contemplated fo** the formation of a special forcein aid of the civil powers had broken down.   At the meetingof *he Sv.Tmlv an^ 7-anspo&quot;*t Committee on the previous day ithad been stated that the Trade Unions had prohibited thei-members f*om joining the Special Const Salary, and. the numberof Special Constables was stated to be totally inadequate.    Theguards en supplies of rifles\ ammunition and other war material,were stated to be small, and the difficulty of increasing themlay in the fact that, the wi+hdrawal. of troops for this purposehampered the essential training of the forces, which ere atpresent raw and inexperienced.The following suggestions were made with a view to safe-guarding the position:-(a) The Secretary of State for &apos;&apos;ar asked for authority*0 F,*on *ho riAPT*atch of the battalions to the nlebieoitary areaeunder the Treaty of Peace..It, y;aa recognised that this step could only be taken with the assent of the Supreme Council, and that, to ask fortheir release, besides causing re^t dislocation of the a-ange-....ment3
 ments, would constitute a serious confession of weakness.

(b) That special precautions were necessary for the safety of the seat of the Central Government, since revolutions rarely succeeded except in cases where the Central Government was upset.

(c) That a special effort should be made to increase the numbers of Special Constables, and in this connection it was suggested that some organisation should be started to make possible the mobilisation of the 20,000 ex-officers  known to be out of employment. Another suggestion in the same order of ideas was that discreet inquiries should be made on an large scale to obtain the names of persons of undoubted loyalty who would agree to join a Special Constabulary on an emergency. (The question of whether this should be undertaken through the evil or the military organisation discussed but not decided.)

(d) That the Prince Minister should at an early date summon a meeting of the Supply and Transport Committee with a view to the further examination of these questions, and to a stimulus to the Government&apos;s organisation in the event of a strike.

(c) That, in the meantime, the Chairman of the Supply and Transport Committee should be asked to furnish an interim report showing the present position.

With a view to further consideration of these questions The Secretary of State for War and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff were asked to furnish the following information.

(1) Figures as to the forces available in Great Britain for the defence of the Government and order, and particulars as to their distribution.

(2) Suggestions as to the best means of re-inforcing them on an emergency.

(3) Ac? to the distribution of stores of arms and ammunition.

 
? CAUCASUS ? THE CASPIAN

(2) The Conference then proceeded to a discussion of the problems raised by the retreat of General Denikin and the consequent threat to the Caucasus and two Caspian. It was pointed out that the command of the Caspian Sea was the pivot of our whole strategical position in the East. Its capture by the Bolshevists would bring about the final downfall of Denkin, turn the frontier of the Caucasus, expose Northern Persia to attack, and immensely increase the resources of the Bolscheviks by giving them control of the oil and other produce of these regions.

The Prime Minister than gave the Conference particulars of the latest developments in this question in Paris. The Military Council at Versailles had advised that an Allied force of two divisions was required for the defence of the Caucasus against the Bolshevists, but discussion their report had been postponed and their naval and military advisers. On the morning the previous day he himself had had an interview with the Polish Foreign Minister who had expressed a wish to work with Caucasian States. As a result of this conversation the Supreme Council had invited M. Jules Cambon, Mr. Philip Kerr and the Marquesi Di Toretta to confer with the representative in Paris of Georgia and the Azerbaijan. The results of this Conference which had taken place on the previous evening had been to show:-

(1) That the representatives of the Caucasus and Azerbaijan believed that, with assistance as described below, they could hold their position. Their people and armies would fight a defensive but not an offensive war.

(a) That if necessary, Georgia could raise 50,000 and the Azerbaijan 100,000 troops. Each state already had a small regular force with good officers who had served in the old Russian Army, including some officers of high rank.

  
(3) That assistance was required in form of food, arms and ammunition. No troops had been asked for.

(4) That both the Georgians and Azerbaijanians desired the recognition of the Government of Daghestan as a de facto Government.

The First Sea Lord then gave the Conference particulars of the measures required to secure the command of the Caspian. These included the taking over by some 1,200 British naval ranks and ratings of the ships now manned by Denikin&apos;s forces in the Caspian; the re-arming of some of the ships; the conveyance to the Caspian, by the Black Sea and across the Transcaucasian States by ?ail, of perhaps three submarines and armed motor-boats: the establishment of a secure base at Baku, for which the Navy would provide such coast defences as required, but he laid stress on the importance of the base on the land side and its overland communications being safeguarded. In view of the probability of the Bolsheviks having a force superior in speed and munitions, the Admiralty could only advise the undertaking if the base and Baku-Batum line were properly secured. The Admiralty&apos;s plans were fully matured. 600 of the naval forces required were already in the Mediterranean and could be moved at once. The necessary a? and munitions had been earmarked for immediate despatch, and the whole of Denikin&apos;s ships would be completely taken over within about a month of the issue of the order.

The Secretary of State for War then raised the question of whether it was sound policy to take steps at this state go constitute the line of defence against Bolshevik advance through the Caucasus. Both the loyalty and the fighting efficiency of the Georgians and the Azerbaijanians was at least very doubtful. Therefore, in his opinion, it was madness to adbandon Danikin and his army who were still putting up a sto? fight in the Kuban and the Don?sion. Apart altogether from our obligation of honour not to desert Denikin and our friends, it was the right couse to strengthen only organised force still amounting to about 100,000

.... men

 
 men, which lay between the Don and the Caucasus, rather than to abandon it and try and build up a new line out of very inferior material on the Southern side of the mountains. He would, therefore, draw a line round Russia along the frontier of Finland, the Baltic States, Poland, Rumania, and the Denkin country and say to the Bolsheviks that the Allies were not concerned with what went on inside these boundaries; that they were prepared to raise the Blockade and trade with them, but that if they trespassed beyond these frontiers they would fight them. He was utterly opposed to leaving the Denikin country outside the ring fence and inside the Russian bear-pit, thereby leaving our friends to the mercy of the Bolsheviks. This was the best that seemed possible at the present time.?

Lord Curzon said that the real difficulty was that the anti-Bolshevik Russians had failed. Koltchak had failed and Denikin now appeared to have failed. Was it possible to build any effective resistance out of them, and was it not better at once to organise the excellent defensive line of the Caucasus. To support Denikin would be a very formidable task; to help by resistance at the line of the Caucasus was not nearly so great an obligation.

Mr. Montagu pointed out that the Bolsheviks were now apparently anxious to make peace with England and might be willing to agree to including Denikin&apos;s country in the Russian area in return for peace and Trade.

Mr. Bonar Law asked whether Denikin really represented the Cossack country, and whether if there was a free representative Assembly it would in point of fact declare for independence from Russia. To insist on the Kuban and Don being excluded from Russia might well be an interference in Russia&apos;s internal affairs.

The Prime Minister said that the first question to consider 

.... was

  
 was whether we could give the necessary support on either of the lines proposed. It would clearly be difficult enough to do it for the Caucasus and Caspian, but to attempt to draw a frontier beyond which we were not going to allow the Bolsheviks to advance along a 1000 miles front across the plains of South East Russia seemed to him out of the question. In point of fact Donikin&apos;s failure had been a political rather than a military failure. He had quarrelled with the Georgians, with Azerbaijan and with Daghestan to the South; he had quarrelled with  the peasants throughout the country which he occupied in his advance because he permitted his officers to seize the land. He had suppressed the Kuban Parliament because it had disagreed with his policy and had executed its leader. Though he was himself a man of integrity, the officers associated with him were many of them hopeless. Denikin&apos;s movement was really part and parcel of a great combined attempt on the part of the anti-Bolshevik Russians in the North, East and South to overthrow Bolsheviks and reconstitute and united anti-Bolshevik Russia. It had utterly failed. Kolt? had disappeared. Denikin had been thrown back in disorder, and seeing that both Koltchak&apos;s and Denikin&apos;s armies had had large quantities of Allied munitions and some thousands of British and Allied officers and K.C.O.S. to help them and at one moment had come within measurable distance of military success, it was clear that the real reason of their failure was that the Russian people did not want them. Further the Bolshevik armies were now very high organised and trained. It seemed to him, therefore, that we had to recognise that this phase of the anti-Bolshevik movement had definitely failed. He, therefore, agreed with the Secretary of State for War&apos;s policy that we ought now to say to the Bolsheviks that we were not

..... concerned


 concerned with what went on inside Russia, hut that we were concerned with the independence of Russia&apos;s neighbours, and would fight them if they attempted to destroy it. He further proposed that the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and Lord Beatty should see the representatives of Georgia and Azerbaijan and report as to what military resistance they were capable of making to Bolshevik advances, remembering that there were only three roads through the Caucasus, two coast roads and the central pass, and that these did not afford facilities for the advance of a great army.

The Secretary of State for War asked if this Leant final desertion of Denikin and the volunteer army because if so he could not agree to it. The Prince Minister said that his only proposal at the moment was to extend the same guarantees and the same help to Azarbaijan and Georgia as? had extended to Poland and the Baltic States. As to Denikin he was still getting our supplies, and he did not see what more we could do to help him hold his own than we were doing at present. The fact that we were proposing to put a second line behind General Denikin and to hold the Caspian for him would be an assistance to him.

Mr. Montagu proposed that we should find out at ones whether the Bolsheviks would agree to exclude the Cossack country from Russia, but it was pointed out that negotiations on those lines with the Soviet Government was impossible for many reasons, including time.

The Chief of the Imperial General Staff explained the views of the General Staff as the defence? of India. He said there were three possible lines of defence. The first was through Constantinople, Batoum, Baku and Herv?. The second was through Constantinople, Batoum, Baku, Enzeli, Toheran, Loshed. The third was through the North of 

.... Palestine

 
 Palestine through Nisibin, Mosul, Khanikin and thence to the Persian Gulf. He was against attempting to hold the two Northern lines if Denikin failed and would prefer to base our defence on our own railheads in Mesopotamia and India.

Lord Curzon pointed out that the proposition at the Moment was not the defence of India, but whether or not we could not Galvanise the Caucasus people into permanent independence and opposition to the Bolsheviks. For this purpose it would be necessary that we should attempt to hold the Caspian Sea, but he was prepared to take some risks in this Matter seeing that there was an alternative road of exist via Enzeli if the Bolsheviks advanced and worse successful in driving us out of Baku before we could withdraw

It was decided that:-

The Chief to the Imperial General Staff and Admiral Beatty should interview the representatives of Georgia and Azerbaijan with a vi? to finding out their powers of resistance and that, ponding their report, the Conference should adjourn.
