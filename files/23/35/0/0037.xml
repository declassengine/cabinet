Briand haddined with Mr Lloyd George at the Hotel Grillon. The sub-stance of the Conversation was communicated to Sir maurice hankey.by the Prime Minister after the meeting.Mr LLOYD GEORGE opened the Conversation by statingthat the question of Upper Silesia was one of extreme diffi-culty, and he did not at present see a solution.    It was true he had not yet seen his Experts, but so far neither henor Lord Curzon could see a way through.M. BRIAND said that Mir Lloyd George must not attachtoo much importance to the attitude of the French Press.The Anti-English papers did not really count for very couch.Certain papers, such as the &quot;Journal&quot;, the &quot;Petit Journal&quot;and the &quot;Petit Parisien&quot;, had taken a much more sensibleattitude., Mr LLOYD GEORGE replied that nevertheless it was the \hostile papers -that were always quoted in England, and their secretary.(This Document is the Property of His BritannicMaj esty * s Government.)- SECRET - /NOTE OP A CONVERSATION BETWEEN THEPRIME MINISTER and M. BRIAND,  on sunday, AUGUST 7, 1921, at 9-30 p.m.
virulent attitude had not been without a certain effect inEngland.    In Labour circles, and to a great extent in Liberalcircles, considerable doubts had been produced as to the wisdom of the Entente.    Even in certain Conservative quarters^particularly where Lord Robert Cecil&apos;s influence was felt,there were also doubts.    What the English people were afraid of was another Alsace-Lorraine and another war of revenge.Owing to the fact that the attacks in the French Press were now assuming a somewhat .personal character, he himself had thought it wiser not to come to the present meeting, and itwas only owing to the insistance of M. briand that he had done so.M. BRIAND replied that he was very glad that Mr LloydGeorge had come, because he liked his mind, and had felt all along that possibly Mr Lloyd George might see a way out.Later on, the two Prime Ministers discussed the procedure to be adopted at the Conference.Mr LLOYD GEORGE suggested that on the following afternoonthe question of Upper Silesia should be discussed in a generaDway, and the case should be stated on each side.    After that,some excuse should be found for remitting the question again to Experts.    It would, of course, be impossible for the experts to reach a result unless they had a hint from above as to what solution they were to reach.    He himself and M.Briand, therefore, must get together privately and try and find the solution.    They could then give their Experts ahint, and the Experts could then send in an agreed Reportfor adoption.    He felt it was important that the formal- - iproposal ^or a solution should come not from, the supreme council itself but from the Experts.M. BRIAND agreed in the wisdom of this course.The Conversation then passed to the question of      ,   1reinforcements, and 11 BRIAND asked whether Mr Lloyd George
could not agree to some details, such as machine-guns, etc.,being sent.Mr LLOYD GEORGE replied that if he found that he and M. &apos;Briand were going to reach agreement on the main issue, andit was important from a political point of view for M.Briandto send some reinforcements, he might consider meeting himjThroughout the Conversation It. Briand was somewhatdepressed, and the Prime Minister was very careful throughoittthe interview to make it perfectly clear that he saw no prospect of a solution.Hotel Grillon,&apos;    PARIS,August 7, 19210
