(This Document is the Property of His BritanninMajesty&apos;s Governments/SECRET -THE GOAL STRIKE.NOTES of a CONVERSATION held at 10, Downing Street, S.W.1on MONDAY, OCTOBER 35,  1980, at 18-15 p.m.PRESENT:-FOR THE GOVERNMENT. FOR THE MINERS&apos;  FEDERATION.The Prime Minister. Mr Smillie.Mr Bonar Lav;. Mr Frank Hodges.Sir Robert Horne. Mr Rob son.Mr Bridgeman. Mr Herbert Smith.The Coal Controller.Sir Maurice Hankey.(As on the previous day, no official record was kept, andthe following brief Note is made from memory only.)ffiRGENCY (1) THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE MINERS&apos; FEDERATION eomment-S BILL.ed adversely on the fact that the Emergency Powers Bill wasto be introduced in the House of Commons that afternoon.They said that it would make it more difficult for them to induce their men to enter into an agreement.THE PRIME MINISTER explained that the Emergency PowersBill was absolutely necessary to enable the Government tomeet the situation created by a strike.    They probably wouldnot have introduced it at this stage if they had only been
faced by a miners&apos; strike.    Eventually, however, in a pro-longed miners&apos; strike the emergency powers were necessaryto enable the Government to distribute coal and even foodequally among the people. There might, for example, be large stocks of coal in the West End and none in the East End, and yet, without these powers, the Government could not secureequal treatment.   What had mainly actuated the Government in introducing the Emergency Powers Bill today was the actionof the railwaymen.    If the Government were to be faced witha railway strike and an electricians&apos; strike it was absolute-ly vital that they should have these powers.   Moreover, ifthey did not seize the present opportunity for obtaining thepowers, the Parliamentary situation towards obtaining themmight become very much more difficult.    At present the Gov-ernment could only operate under D.O.R.A.., and this wouldexpire the moment the Turkish SJreaty was ratified.    The powers were very much more limited than the miners seemed&apos;to think,and only enabled the Government to commandeer transport anddistribute supplies equally, etc.    These were powers whichnearly every other nation already possessed, and he himself had been surprised when he discovered that we did not already possess them.    The powers sought for would not give theGovernment any power for dealing a blow at Trade Unionism.THE MINERS&apos; REPRESENTATIVES said that, unfortunately,  itwould make their position more difficult,  and they urged thatthe spokesman of the Government in the House of commons should lay stress on what the Prime Minister had said.
3 ^ION, (2) THE PRIME MINISTER then read the document inp Appendix I, and handed it to the representatives of theMiners&apos;  Federation.( Mr SMILLIE said it was no use his giving any reply about this, for it was impossible for him and his colleagues to*place before his Executive any document based on output..THE PRIME MINISTER then read the alternative in appendix ii, based on profits, explaining that this was a substitute for paragraph 2 (b) of Appendix I, and that the earlier part of Appendix I was unaltered.After an interval, during which the representatives ofthe Miners&apos;  Federation examined this document, Mr SMILLIEoffered a few preliminary criticisms of the proposal.    he pointed out that it was apparently proposed to base theprofits on the November figures for export coal.    He remind-ed the representatives of the Government, however, that byNovember the Government stocks of coal would have fallenconsiderably, and that the first aim of the Government wouldbe to increase their home stocks.    This would mean thatthere would be a diminution in the quantity of coal avail-able for export, and the probability was strong that theprofits from export coal would not be sufficient to givethe miners their full 2/-.He pointed out also that the same objection applied hereas he had made the previous day on the output proposal,namely, that the miners were penalised in the event of a failure to reach output, although the mine owners might be just as much responsible.    He thought that the Governmentwere trying to over-reach the miners, and might have made amore favourable offer.SIR ROBERT HORNE then explained that the intentionbfthe Government was to take the figures for September andto assume that every ton of coal in excess of what had been-S-
retained for home consumption in September was to count as&apos;coal for export, and would be credited to the pool from&apos;which the 2/- would be payable.    Hence, even though in fact the Government might do as Mr Smillie suggested, and retain a portion of this coal to build up their stocks, neverthe-less it would be assumed to count as export coal.Mr SMILLIE then stated that the Miners&apos;  Federation couldnot recognise any arrangement for an automatic reduction inthe men&apos;s wages unless the employers also had to make somesacrifice.    They could not accept a one-sided burden.A further criticism was that,in the draft now before him,the increase of 2/- a day, etc., only commenced from thedate of the resumption of work, whereas previously it had   -always been assumed that any increases were to date from october 1st.Another criticism was that it would take some time,afterthe resumption of work, before the full output was reached.A certain amount of repair work would have to be carriedout, for example.    To take the period of November alone was,therefore, taking too short a period on which to make acalculation.    He also observed that since, under this scheme,wages were to depend upon increased values, the scheme wastantamount to an increase in output.THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE GOVERNMENT pointed out that most of these points were criticisms on which there wasample room for negotiation.    They did not affect theprinciple at stake.    The Government had made a great eon-cession in proposing the immediate increase of 2/-.    Thiswas a concession which the men could retain if they would work hard.    The Prime Minister and his colleagues had seen representative mine owners, and had put it to themthat it would greatly assist in a settlement if the-4-
mine owners could see their way to make a proportionatereduction out of their 10 per cent, in the event of theoutput not being realised.After some further discussion, during which Mr Hodgesasked a number of questions to enable him better to under-stand the scheme, it was arranged that, in the first instance,Mr Hodges should confer with the Coal Controller on figures,in order to enable him to explain the scheme to the Miners&apos;Federation.    After this, the representatives of the Miners&apos;Federation would meet their Executive, after which theywould return to discuss the matter further with the repre-sentatives of the Government.whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,October 25, 1920.
APPENDIX      T.1. The Mining Association and the Miners&apos;  Federation shall(a) co-operate to the fullest extent to obtain increased  &apos;output and for the purpose will arrange to set upDistrict Committees and a National Committee.(b) proceed forthwith to prepare a scheme for submission to the Government for the regulation of wages advances in the industry having regard among other considera-tions to the profits of the industry and to the prin-ciples upon which the surplus profits of the industry are to be dealt with.2.

If the output for the four weeks ending27th November falls below the annual rate of 248,000,000tons, but not below the rate of 246,000,000 tons, the advance will continue to be paid.    If it falls below&apos;   246 000,000 tons but not below 242,000,000 tons, ls.6d.will be paid;    if it falls below 242,000,000 tons but notbelow 238,000,000 tons, 1/- will be paid;   with propor-tionate reduction for youths and boys in each case.Each subsequent four weeks will be similarly dealt withon the basis of the four weeks preceding.
