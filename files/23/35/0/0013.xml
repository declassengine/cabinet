Deschanel that afternoon.    The effect of theIBS CHANEL.oonve --sation, of which the Prime Minister gave a full account, was to indicate that if M. Deschanel represented the nev/ reside in Paris their policy was likely to be cf aI somewhat Chauvinistic character.Led Pi-Xenhe^d s**ted that at a meeting he had held that morning the French Minister of Justice, who had hithertoshown himself very reasonable, hai  .       hardened perceptibly.The Prii-se Minister said that M. Deachanel had notbeen able to give him any indication as to the future of theConference, as this was a matter for M. Millsrand, thenew President of the Council. :j
10 POLICY.1&apos;   (fe) with reference to Minute 4 of the Cabinet Conferencejjueasus. held on the previous day, the Prime Minister gave a very full account of the greeting held at the Quai d&apos;Orsay that morning.Pe+ails Fill be found in the p**oaes-verbeaux of the twoM : ^   Meetings,  (I.CP.-J.J and M&amp;), and the conclusions reached are attached ag an Appendix to these notes.   No decision hadbeen reached in regard to Mr Churchill&apos;s proposal for unifyingthe Command and co-ordinating the efforts of the Statesbordering on Russia, as M. Clemenceau had suddenly adjournedthe sitting, and the P**ime Minister did not think that it was much use pressing this proposal until the new French Govern-ment was established.This view was generally -agreed to.,    .UU/vt^V II,. f^GLf-feared  u^JLft.JOULMr Churchill summed up/the new policy towards Russiasomewhat as follows:-   To abandon the policy of giving any assistance to the anti-Bolshevist fo-cea engaged in the civil war In Russia;   in fact, to leave thaia to their fate, thoughcompleting any obligations that might have been entered into.The Prime Minister inte polated that if General Denikincontinued to defend the Crimea he would be in favour of givinghire the sa.;e sort of support as hitherto.    He was somewhatdoubtful, boweve^j as to whether it was wise to support himon the Don.    He appeared to be on the point of collapse.Mr Churchill, continuing hie summing-up of the policy,said it was to support the s, all States round the fringes,who ardently desired their freedom&apos;    these would be maintainedas a sort of pad against Bolshevism, in the hope that whenthe ilrife of civil war in Russia had come to an end and therewas no further internal antagonism, the Bolshevists would beprepared to recognise the independence of these States.57ith our aid it was hoped that these States might be able tomaintain themselves.    He thought that was a fair and not anexaggerated statement of the new policy.mbe P-ims Minister agreed that it was not an unfairstatement.   *e had not, however, definitely abandoned Denikin.,- o^.
Mr Churchill said&apos;he was net certain as to the presentposition of General denikin.    Undoubtedly he had endeavoured to hold too wide a front, but conceivably,now that hisfont had contracted, he might be able t0 hold on.    We ought not, to pr-judge the question.The Prime Ministor strongly urged that the War office should not hand over material to General Denikin if there wasa probability of its being thrown away.Mr. Churchill entirely as-eed.   tXvS^ WOv OAxJL- unMjk &apos;The Prime Minister asked Mr Churchill to bear in mindtwo other possibilities of anti-Bolshevist activities.    Thefirst was the possibility of a serious effort by the KubanCossacks, to whom allusion had been made in the Quai dTCrsaymeeting. .Mr Churchill pointed out that the Kuban Cossacks hadbeen the mainspring of Denikin7 s forces, and the represents,-tives of the Caucasian States had naturally been violentlycritical of them.The Prime Minister recalled that there had been trouble in the Kuban Parliament, and that General Denikin had -arresterthe President and shot him.Mr Churchill recalled that General Denikin had actedat the instigation of the two Divisions of Kuban Cossacks.The Prime Minister said the second possibility wasthat it was conceivable that the Ukraine might say that theywere not for Denikin, who in their eyes represented the oldregime,- but that t^ey wanted an independent and autonomousUkraine.Mr Churchill said that as long as General Denikincontinued fighting it was a matter of honour to us to main-tain him.The /Prime Miniate- said it was not a matter of honourhut a matte&quot; of Judgment.    It must be recalled that our resources were not unlimited, and it would not be possibleto vote any further sums in the next financial year.
lir Churchill said he wished to point out how serious 1the effects of the new policy were.    At the most c-itlealmoment in General Denikinrs operations the new policy ofobtaining wheat from the Bolshevists had been announced.The facts ;;,ust be faced, and he would show that very eon-siderable complications would ensue, from the point of viewof those who supported the new policy.    It   light eexacerbate and arouse the national spirit of Denikin&apos;s forcesThey stood for a united Russia, and the new policy was against it;    They were totally opposed to the establishmentof 8.2a 11 States carved out of the former Russia, but the new policy was for it.    All he said at the moment was &quot;Do notcut off General Denikih&apos;s supplies&quot;.^he Prine Minista- said he agreed.    He had already stated that if General Denikin would hold the Crimea it was worth while considering the question of giving him support.&amp;? Churchill said that General Denikin&apos;3 forces had fought a g*eat battle, but now they *&apos;ere being destroyed.When they were out of the way no doub* it would      greatlyassist the new oolicy.The P&quot;ime Minister agreed.Mr Chu-chill pointed out that the new oolicy of thischain of bo-der States, which it was hoped would succeed,mi-ht bring frightful evil with it.    It involved abandoning the cause we had hitherto supported, a cause which stoodfc a united Rissia.    This cause was only abandoned to beit &apos;^-created.    Prom the moment that /-as understood, general denikin*s forcss would cease to exist and there would only be one Russia   a Bolshevist Hussia.    The only course open tothe elements loyal to ourselves, for which he himself stood,was to ioin the Bolshevists.    This, as a matte- of fact, waspoinff on, and many were already gain? oy?.y to Bolshevismbecaus- Bolshevist Russia was a r\o-e presentable object tharYou would get, the sefore, a united Russia which would be bitterly hostile to the
Entente and to Great Britain, but f-iendly to Germany.   AGovernment would be created somewhat similar to the Pirectoireto which the old elements under one form or another, under one excuse or another * would have come back.    This newRussian State would find itself confronted with a ring of newStates all round it.    All these new States would be   a matterof irritation to them.    The Army might not be very closelyunder their control.    Both from the point of view of internal and external policy they would be bound to attack them.    he agreed that no othe-&apos; course was open for adoption at themoment, but it would b-inp the Allies -ight up againstBolshevist Russia.    They would not attack all these states at once, but they would take them singly.    Nor would they make the mistake of announcing that they were going to conquerthem;    they would declare that they were going to deliverthem from the tyranny of the white Guards, o** what not.    Nowthis new policy had been adopted, however, these Governmentsought to be organised.    Borne great Allied General ought tomake plans by which, if the Bolshevists attacked Poland, theywould be attacked from Finland or elsewhere, so as to show the Bolshevists that they could not wipe out fi-st one Stateand then another..    This organisation was absolutely necessary,because the new noliay was certain to produce a greatnational Russia which must be hostile to our civilisationand to our external policy.    The only hope was that Leninwould prove himself strong enough to restrain the militaristelements, to demobilise and adopt a pacific policy.    Thertsk that he could not do so, however was very great, andthe only thin&quot; to be done-was to organise these States.Lord Our-zon pointed out that E&apos;r Churchill had de-nounced the new policy, and al;. ost in the same breath hadadmitted that that was the only thing to be done.    his proposals as regards the co-ordination and unification ofCom and fo* the defence of the border States could be put-po-pf^d *rtv*n the new French Government was formed.
He felt, however, that Mr Churchill had made one mistake. There was no reason to believe that the Bolshevists wished to attack the ring of border States.

 Mr Churchill said the only reason they had not done so was because they had been fully occupied with Kolchak and Denikin.

 Lord Curzon said that the negotiations at Dorpat (which the Prime Minister pointed out had been carried out when Kolchak and Denikin were virtually beaten) did not support this view. The representatives of the Caucasian States had that morning expressed the view that they had no reason to believe that the Bolshevists wished to attack them, and he could see no evidence of Imperialistic desires on the part of the Bolshevists.

 Mr Montagu said he had always understood that expansion wap the very life-blood of Bolshevism, and that both propaganda and military methods were contemplated.

 The Prime Minister said there was no evidence of this.

 Mr Montagu asked what the answer was to Mr Churchill&apos;s suggestion that they would announce that they wished to free these countries?

 The Prime Minister asked what evidence there was that they would wish to do so?

 Mr Churchill recalled the case of Hungary, which the Bolshevists had desired to free by military operations.

 Lord Curzon suggested that the Conference should ascertain what assistance Field-Marshal Wilson and Marshall ? could give to the Caucasian States.

 Mr Churchill asked if we were going to take away from Denikin the war material promised to him and to hand it over to the Caucasian States while Denikin was still fighting. He himself did not oppose the new policy but he asked for fair treatment to Denikin so long as he maintained his front.

 The Prime Minister agreed, so long as the General Staf was convinced that Denikin was putting up a real fight.


 Mr Churchill said that General Holman had been instructed not to hand over further material unless he was sure that proper use would be made of it. The War office had been considerably hampered, in sending out material, by the Shipping Controller. He thought, however, that a very fair packet of supplies could be made up for the Caucasian States.

 Lord Curzon drew attention to General Milne&apos;s recent telegram indicating that 2,000 officers and many wives of Russian officers were seeking refuge from South Russia. This did not seem to indicate that General Denikin had any prospect of holding his own.

 Mr Churchill said that we ought not to provide accommodation for any adult male. He was determined to ensure, as far as possible, that our own Mission were extricated, and consequently precautions were being taken somewhat in advance of the absolute needs of the military situation.

Lord Curzon suggested that some officers of the mission should be sent to Batum.

 The Prime Minister pointed cut that Marshal Foch had expressed the view that General Denikin could not last long. He asked what was Sir Henry Wilson&apos;s view.

 Field-Marshal Sir Henry Tilson said that this appeared to depend on the Cossacks. A week or two ago, when  things looked black for General Denikin, he had seen an officer, just back from South Russia, who expressed the view that General Denikin could probably hold the right bank of the Don, that is to say, the Cossack country.  A Pole who had called on him today, and who knew Denikin well, had expressed the same view.

 Mr Churchill said that M. Maklakoff, whom he had seen today, had said much depended upon General Denikin not being abandoned. If he was not abandoned, his army would stay with him. But the new announcement as regards obtaining food from Russia would be taken as foreshadowing his abandonment, and


Denikin&apos;s army would think that the only thing to be done was to go over to the Bolshevists. Already the Bolshevists were holding out the paw to them. He would like a message sent to General Denikin to the effect that what had been promised would be sent, in order to counteract the effect of the food announcement. He agreed with Mr Hooven that the new commercial policy might have good results. Nevertheless, ? would ? large numbers might, go over from Denikin&apos;s army, and Denikin&apos;s future depended on that.

 The Prime Minister said he was glad to hear that the Kuban Cossacks were opposed to the Bolshevists.

 Mr Churchill asked if he right send a message to General Denikin, to the effect that the Stores promised him would be continued to be sent so long as the front held, and that the British Mission would, as arranged, be kept there until March 31st, so long as there was no collapse.

The Prime Minister said that he would first like to receive a full Military Appreciation from General Holman, and to hear the advice of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff in regard to it.

 Field-Marshall Sir Henrv Wilson said that he had sent our General Milne to report on the situation. He had left Constantinople two days ago, and could be relied on to give a fair and unbiassed appreciation.

? CASPIAN. (8) The Prime Minister said that it had become clear at the Meeting at the Quai d&apos;Orsay that no-one would send troops to guard the communications with the Caspian. The A?baijanians had said that there was a garrison of 7,000 men in Baku very well armed. The Georgian representatives at the Quai d&apos;Orsay had made a most favourable impression. They had stated that their population had, like other Russian provinces, undergone military training. He asked if, after having the Caucasian representatives, Admiral Beatty had anything to say.


Lord Beatty said that the Wavy had been criticised asunwilling to take risk3.    When the proposition as to the caspian had originally been placed before-e the Admiraltythey had been asked to consider the conditions which would arise when the ice melted.    Their problem was to consider how, with an inferior force, they could deny the use of the caspian for the transport of troops to an ens.ay.   He wishedto point out that the ships were of ve-y inferior quality;they were only armed merchant vessels;    their guns were oldand would ^ve to be replaced, and they would be opposed byfast and relatively modern ships.   All the tactical andmaterial advantages would be on the side of the enemy.    Never-thelessi the Admiralty had said they would undertake it, pro-vided that they had. a protected base at Baku.    They had drawnup a scheme on that basi3,    They had, however, to insist thatthe base should be protected from the sea, and from Attack byland, and that ccn-mmicaticns to it should be securely held.-The next phase had been when, a few days ago* he and the-Chief of the Imperial General Staff had been asked to inter-view the representatives of the Georgians and Azerbaijanians.The Georgians, he considered, from what he had heard, we-e am^ii.ta&quot;w-r rsioe, honest and trustworthy.   Th&amp;t assisted him toa certain extent.    His opinion of the Azerbaijanians, however,was much less favourable-, and it Was they who held Baku.    Hewas advised by the Admiralty Intelligence Department thatthere were some BO,000 Russians in Baku who might turnBolshevist at any moment.    (The Prime Miniate^ interpolatedthat BO,000 meant men, women and children.)   Already oneabortive attempt at a rising had been made.    Befce anythingcould be done by the Navy that position must be made secure.He had come to the private conclusion that if the War office were prepared to send one Division to support the Azerbaijanhe would risk the protection of the Georgians in the Westernhalf o* the nrW.    But the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff, however, who was the  -asponaible adviser on thisquestion, adhered to his estimate of three Divisions.
Lo^d Beatty then read a telegram he had received fromthe Commandar-in-chief of the Mediterranean, in which thatFlag Officer had spontaneously, and without any prompting orrequest from the Admiralty, asked that the despatch of Navalranks and ratings to Baku should not take place unless theBaku-Batum &quot;all-ray was guaranteed by British t-oopa, and Bakuheld by B-irish mil it a-7 forces.   He himself did not feel justified in over-aiding such an important pronouncement f-01*he man on the spot, with all the knowledge at his disposal.In view of this statement he felt that it would be only throw--f.r.0- away the lives of valuable men to trust to the Caucasians,in whom the Chief of the Imperial General Staff had no confi-dence.    He was reminded by the First Lord that the ships inBaku were untrustworthy.    It must be remembered that afterMarch 15th. the ice would melt, and they only had until then to get ready.   This was hardly sufficient tine to get theships f^om Denikin, to have ship-^epai-e^s sent out, and toget the ships  ^paired.   At present the ships we re quite unfi-to fight.    Their guns had only 10,000 yards range as comparedwith 17,000 yards range possessed by the enemy1 s guns.    Thesituation would be similar to the Battle of the Falkland Is-lands, where the Ger: ans had been destroyed without our shipscomin&quot; within -*.r.ze.    But if he could be given two months hecould rectify this, * hough during that time Baku must be&apos; madepe *perfectly safe.The prime Minister said the question was whether it wa-worth while taking the risk involved.Field-Marshal Sir Henry &quot;ilson pointed out that theRussian Fleet, -ather than hand over to the British Sfcsvy,might turn Bolshevik.The Prime Minister said that in that case, of course,the whole thing would be at an end.Field-Marshal Sir Henry hlson recalled that when wehad previously been in the Caucasus we had held the Baku-
 The Prime Minister asked where Denikin repaired his ships.

 Lord Beatty said that Denikin&apos;s base was at Petrovsk.

 Mr Churchill said that Petrovsk was about to fall. One way of getting over the difficulty might be to say to Denikin that we contemplated taking over his ships, and that this meant that we must recognise the Caucasian States. We might insist that he should recognise these States, and, in addition,that he should establish a better Government, such as Savinkoff might establish. If he could make terms with the Caucasian States and, in addition, undertake to maintain Baku, then a shield would be provided and time would be gained. Denikin was how much humbled, and might possibly be willing to make common cause with the Caucasian States. It might be worth while to put it to him. If that was effected and all stood together, it might be possible to give the necessary security to the Baku Dockyard. The moment the British took control of the fleet in the Caspian the whole  situation would be pulled together.

 Lord Curzon said that he had put a somewhat similar proposal to Mr Teeretelli. He had pointed out that  the Caucasians and Denikin had the same enemy, and he had asked why, if General Denikin was driven back, he should not agreeto co-operate with him. Mr. Tsereteili simply would not look at it. The hatred of the Georgians  against Denikin was greater than their hate of the Bolshevists.

 Mr Churchill said that probably Denikin, instead of ? on the Caucasian States, would go to the Crimea.

 Mr Long pointed out a further objection, that negotiations, ? if successful, would take time, and the Navy could not afford to delay taking action at once.

Mr Churchill suggested a method of expediting matters by sending a suitable telegrams to General Denikin, and at the same time working on Mr Teeratelli and authorising the Admiralty to make a start.

 Lord Beatty pointed out that all this would not ensur the protection of Baku.


 Mr Churchill suggested that ? of a general scheme of ? all anti Bolshevik elements at the at the same time the military ? might consider the possibility of sending a few more battalions - Indian, with a few British - to the Caucasus, and a plan could be worked out for getting out the sailors, in the last emergency, through Enzeli. It had to be recognised that the loss of the Caspian is equivalent to the loss of a great province of the British Empire.

 Lord Curzon said that, as a civilian, he felt powerless to combat the naval and military arguments. He thought, how-ever, that Lord Beatty understood the supreme importance of the Caspian. After hearing all that had been said, was there really nothing that the Naval and Military Advisers oould suggest?

 Lord Beatty said that all he asked for was military support from Baku on the land side.

 Lord Curzon asked what was the minimum force he required?

 Lord Beatty said that that question must be put to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff.

 Mr Long said that the Admiralty had undertaken to do their part. The difficulty was on the military side.

 Lord Curzon asked the Chief of the Imperial General Staff What incentive the Bolshevists would have to break this railway. He very much doubted if they would attack it. Supposing the two ends were held, was it essential te keep the railway? Was the necessity for this that the force on the Caspian would have to be supplied?

 Field-Marshal Sir Henry Wilson said that this was the reason. He himself profoundly distrusted not only the Azerbaijanians but the Georgians also. Only last November the ? had wanted to attack the Armenians and sent 7,000 men. Now the Azerbaijan was asking the Armenians to help defend the Caucasus. Was this likely?

 Lord Curzon suggested that the railway might be held by local troops.


 Field-Marshal Sir Henry Wilson said that in any case local troops would have to protect it to a great extent. Two Divisions spread over 500 miles would be strung out very thin. We should have to run this railway from the very start, as the rolling stock was in a very bad condition. In reply to the Prime Minister, he said that the reason for his distrust of the Georgians was that they had given up ? only two years ago to the Turks.

 The Prime Minister pointed out that since then there had been a great national movement and a new State started in Georgia. At that time they had been part of the old Russia.

 Mr Churchill suggested that some Serbian elements might be obtained.

 Field-Marshall Sir Henry Wilson said he supposed the object of this operation was to defend Mesopotamia and India.

 Mr Long said that an even more important object was to hold the oil of Baku. All the experts insisted on the important ? of this.

 The Prime Minister said that the real importance was to establish a barrier against Bolshevism. He himself was not in the least afraid of an attack by the Bolshevists on Mesopotamia and India. The fundamental mistake that was being made was to suppose that the Bolshevists were really a great military force. In a civil war, where the numbers were limited, no doubt they had a great superiority. But they were without good communications and without munition factories, and it was absurd to talk of their undertaking an expedition against India, which we had always regarded as a very serious matter for the Russian Empire when at its strongest.

 Field-Marshall Sir Henry Wilson said that in this case it did not seem worth while sending sailors to the Caspian.

 Mr Churchill pointed out that holding the Caspian would see to establish the possibility of a flank attack on an enemy advancing on India. Even if Krasnovodsk and the railway to the east of it was not occupied, there  would
always be a threat from that direction.

Field-:Marshal Sir Henry Wilson said that this would cost too many troops. The line Krasnovodsk - Merv had been given up at the request of the Secretary of State for India because it required so many troops.

Lord Curzon gave a brief explanation of the results which would ensue if the Caspian was lost. First, Armenia would go. From a political point of view that seriously affected the Peace Treaty, as it would be necessary to build up a new State of Armenia. Then Georgia and the Azerbaijan would go. Third, the Caspian would be lost.   Fourth, Enzeli would fall to the Bolsheviks, and this ?ould be followed by the loss of North Persia, against which the Bolsheviks had designs.  The Shah of Persia would then disappear, and North Khora?san would be occupied by the Bolsheviks.  All this would stir the Afghans to their vitals, and the position would become very serious. A wave would be set in motion that would not stop until it laved the mountain barriers of India.  He did not like, in talking to one of Lord Beatty&apos;s record, to talk of unwillingness to run risks. Probably no-one-in tho world had run greater risks. But he wished he could find some legitimate risk that Could be taken to save the situation. He felt convinced that something ought to be done, and that the soldiers and sailors ought to discover some way out.

Field-Marshal Sir Henry Wilson replied that we had already once been in the Caucasus, and in his view had very wisely withdrawn. The fact was we simply had not got the troops to send there. 

Mr Churchill asked whether if we could get out of sending the plebiscite battalions we should be able to wake up a force with Indian battalions supplemented by one ? two of the plebiscite forces.

???

The Prime Minister pointed out that we could only get out of sending the plebiscitary battalions on one ground, whi? had been mentioned the previous day.


Mr Upntagu asked whet he- the suggestion to obtain(f   Serbian troops could not be followed up.Field-Marshal Sir Henry Wilson pointed out that thenegotiations would take months.Lord Beatty said that the Navy roust have their decisiontoday b** tono^-ow, oh it would be too late.Mr Churchill pointed out that if some troops could besent, Serbians or other troops might follow late&quot;.    He again   .reverted to the idea that General Denikin might be induced to send 10,000 of his best men to Baku, if we undertook inreturn to support him in the Crimea.   Many of these menpractically had a rope round their neck if the Bolshevistscaptured them, and they had no alternative but to go onfighting.Mr Long asked if sufficient troops could not be obtain-ed from somewhere.Field-Marshal Sir Henry &apos;wilson  said that the t*Qor*sdid not exi*** * Ftayot and India were each calling for fivemore battalions,and troops were also required at home,The Prime Minister said it was quite clear that theoperation could not be undertaken.   He accepted the viewsof Lxrd Beatty and Field^Marshal Wilson.Mr Churchill asked that this decision should notnecessarily be final, and should be **eviewed within a week,conditionswhen      &quot;      might have snanged.Mmary 19, 1920.
