Trot giQeument is the Property of-aiHOTE of a Conversation &quot;between thePrime Minister and M. Loucheur at aLuncheon at 10. Downing Street, onWednesday, 3rd December, 1919.The following were present:-The Prime Minister.Mr. Winston S. Churchill.M. Loucheur.Sir Maurice Hankey.Prof. P.J. Mantaux.The conversation turned largely on the general relations between Prance and Great Britain and moreparticularly on their policy in regard to Bussia andthe Turkish Peaoe.Mo Loucheur began by dwelling on the importanceof a complete understanding between Great Britain and france on all questions of foreign policy.    These twocountries, he said, were practically the only fullyorganised States remaining in Europe.    In Italy thesituation was very serious and this was particularlydangerous for Prance.   He thought that Great Britainand Prance ought to formulate a scheme of general andeconomic policy which they could present to theUnited States of America and which, he thought, america would then accept.   When pressed by the Prime Minister,however, he agreed that America was disinterestingherself more and more in European affairs and that inview of the probable continuance of President Wilson1sill health, it would be extremely difficult to.obtainany decisions from the United States.The first point to which the conversation turnedwas Bussia.   When asked by the Prime Minister to explainhis proposals in detail, M. Loucheur said that in theview
view of the French Government, support by troopa was notpractical politics.   The first step, he advocated., was to&quot;bring together the Eussian representatives in Paris and toget them to agree as to some scheme for the politicalstatus of all the various anti-Bolshevist elements inEussia.   He regarded this as of the first importance.Next, he would support the anti-Bolshevist States &quot;by sendingsurplus war material in large quantities, this being partlypaid for by commodities given in exchange.   France, he said,was already arranging to send war material to General Denikinin exchange for commercial products.   He agreed that theFrench Government could not ask the Frenoh Parliament for a vote of Credit in favour of Eussia.   This, however, did notapply to Poland.   The traditional and historical friendshipof France for Poland would not preclude financial assistancefrom France to that country.   He would encourage Poland toco-operate with General Denikin against the Bolshevists.Mr. Churchill observed that if a decision to this effect was not reached very shortly, General Denikin mightcollapse.M. Loucheur, however, did not confine himself toBus si an policy..   He said he had prepared and committedthe paper, a complete scheme of policy covering the wholeof Europe as well as Turkey.At this point, the Prime Minister interposed with astatement as to the gravity of the present position.   TheUnited States were withdrawing themselves more and more from European affairs.   He could not agree with M. Ii6.uchettrthat there was even a reasonable prospect that the UnitedStates would give France a loan for the rehabilitation of the devastated areas.   This made it all the moreimportant that Great Britain and France should sticktogether.   What was the position, however?   The relationsbetween the two countries on certain questions had-2- latterly
latterly &quot;been most unsatisfactory.   The French Press hadconstantly attacked the British Government, particularlyin relation to Syria, and had accused them of all kinds of &quot;bad faith.   The Quai d&apos;Orsay and even Mo Olemenceauhimself, probably at the instigation of the Quai dIOrsay,had been by no means friendly.   When he had proposed, forexample, that&apos; General Gouraud should come to London todiscuss matters with Pi eld-Marshal Allenby before proceeding to Syria, tie had received a reply from Mo Glemeneeau couched in terms that were almost insulting, more than hinting atbad faith on the part of the British Government.   although he had replied in studiously friendly terms, Me Glemeneeau1 sletter, had left an unpleasant impression.The Prime Minister pointed out that Prance was not left in a very easy situation as the result of the war.   InGermany, as all the information he received pointed, Prancewas regarded with sullen hostility.   A feeling was growingup in Germany akin to that which had existed in Prancetowards Germany in 1871.   Prance could not count on support from the United States.   Consequently, it was essential thatshe should continue her former close relations with GreatBritain.   If this was to be the ease, the Press attacks mustcease and bitterness must not be allowed to grow up out ofpolitical affairs, such as that of Syria, which were not really of vital importance to either Nation.M. Loucheur admitted that the relations of the twocountries were not all that could be desired and said thatone of the reasons which had prompted him to come to london was to prepare the way for improvement in this respect.   Hehad already given his general ideas in regard to Bussianpolicy and he would like to develop them further^   As regardsthe Turkish Peace, he outlined the following proposals.He would allow the Turks to remain in Constantinople,* but he would place the Straits under Anglo-Prench control-3- with
with an Anglo-French garrison.   The whole of the Straitswould be run as an Anglo-French concern with a Turkishfacade.   He proposed that the whole of the Turkish railways should be run by an Anglo-French Board similar to the suez Canal Board, the actual administration of the Straitsbeing also conducted by an Anglo-French Board.As regards the Italians, he proposed an Anglo-Franeo-Xtalian Board for working the Heraclea Coal District, Italybeing given priority of purchase of the produots of the mines.   He seemed to think that Italy would be satisfied with this.   Personally he was not in favour of Franceremaining in cilicia but he admitted that if, owing to the pressure of the Colonial Party, France had to remain there,it would be difficult for her to avoid undertaking come degree of protection for the Armenians.   His plan for theprotection of the Armenians, however, was to attach aBritish or French Officer or Official to the staff of theTurkish Talis and High Officials.   He asked the PrimeMinister if he would state what were the British desideratain Turkey.The Prime Minister said that Great Britain desired a mandate for Mesopotamia and Palestine.   He emphasised thegreat importance of no quarrel arising between Great Britainand France in regard to these regions.   Great Britaindesired that France shottld come to terms with the Arabs, butthey must do so without enabling the Arabs to say that theyhad been deserted by Great Britain.   France must avoid awar with Feisal.   If such an eventuality occurred, howevercorrect the attitude of the Governments, it would be almost impossible to avoid embittering the relations of the twocountries.   Opinion in Great Britain would be stronglymoved in favour of the Arabs who had fought alongside usin the Palestine campaign.   There would be interviews withand articles by such people as Colonel Xawrenee.   The-4- British
British Press, which had hitherto &quot;behaved very well and hadnot retaliated to the attacks of the French Press, wouldpublish violent articles and public opinion would be stronglymoved.As regards Palestine, the.Prime   Minister said that all he wanted was the traditional boundaries of Dan andBeersheba.   Some people considered that the boundary should run north of Dan, but he had only asked for Palestine andhe defined this as the original traditional Palestine.   Ifthe two countries could not agree as to the proper boundary,he was prepared to submit it to arbitration by someonenominated by President Wilson.   He laid stress on theimportance of securing the use of the Waters of the Jordanto Palestine which, Uo Loucheur remarked, could be arranged as an economic question.In regard to Mesopotamia, the Prime Minister statedthat the British Government wanted a pipe line and a railwayconnecting Mosul with Haifa.   This was primarily a commercialrequirement but not entirely so as the British government must insist on the right to transfer troops by it to dealeither with a local rebellion or, conceivably in the distantfuture, a war with some other State, and they must be able   fto transfer the troops without violating Francers neutrality./Mo Loucheur said that it would be necessary to get roundMo Clemenceau on these questions and he promised to use hisgood offices in this respect.   Contrary to what the PrimeMinister believed, he thought that M, Berthelot was sincerelyanxious to come to an agreement with Great Britain on thesequestions.   M. Berthelofr had worked very hard to come to anagreement with Feisa! and he had heard M* Eerthelot speak inhigh terms to M. Clemenceau of the Emir Feisal.   He was veryhopeful that France would come to terms with the Arabs asthe result of the conversations with Feisal.The Prime Minister said he was much less hopeful.    The-5- Emir
Emir Peisal had written him a letter from Paris which wasnot encouraging.   M. Loucheur ought to see this letter andhe instructed Sir Maurice Hankey to show it to him.(Sir Maurice Hankey sent, a copy of the letter to Mr. Churchillwho was to see M. Louoheur on the same afternoon).Mb Loucheur, continuing, said, that he actually proposedto approach M. Clemenceau through Mo Berthelot with whom hehad discussed the whole question before coming to England.teHA^gene*a3r&quot;&quot;que^t^n^^e thought there had been faults on both sides.   Actioncertainly ought to be taken to change the attitude of theFrench Press which he admitted was abominable.   The french people, however, thought that the British attitude was oftenvery grasping, particularly in regard to oil.   They appearedto be endeavouring to secure control of oil all over theworld, not only in Mesopotamia but even in Boumania.The Prime Minister said he had never heard of any british Government action in regard to Roumanian oil.The conversation then turned on the question of thebest means of procedure.   In this connection, Mr. Churchillagain urged the importance of avoiding delays since unlessPoland was put in motion against the Bolshevists within afew weeks, General Denikin might collapse.M. Loucheur said that Mo Clemenceau was most unwilling /to come to London for any general discussion of the TurkishPeace.Mr. Lloyd George pointed out that this had always beenM. Clemenceau1s attitude ever since he came into office.Before that time, the Conferences had taken placealternately in London and Paris.   M. ribot , though as oldas M. Clemenceau, had not hesitated to come to London.Nevertheless, in deference to M. Clemenceaurs age and out of the great respect and honour which he felt for/him,Mr. Lloyd George himself had consented to journey time after-6- time
time *o Paris.   A  the beginning of the present year, he   Vand -Mr. Balfour had spent five months in Paris.   Mrc Bonar Lawyjbrd Milner, Mr. Churchill, Mr. Chamberlain, lord Curson,    ^ &apos;Mr. Barnes and other British Ministers had had to spend, inthe aggregate, weeks in Paris.   All this time they had hadto leave their business in London which was heavy and urgent.Meanwhile, M. Clemenceau and his colleagues had been on the spot in Paris and had been able to attend to their duties-       / Iwithout intermission.   In the present situation in England,with many important measures coming before Parliament andwith numerous urgent questions to be settled, including thatof the railwaymen^s wages, which if not settled before december 3lst might result in a Railway strike, it was quite impossible for him or for any of his colleagues to proceed -to Paris for another prolonged Conference*   He urged very       fstrongly that on this occasion, M. Clemenceau, accompanied,..-.&apos;if possible by M. Loucheur himself or M. Tardieu, should come to London, where they might meet representatives &apos;qf.Italy for a discussion of the Turkish Treaty, and of Ja\panMas well for a discussion of Russian policy.    The American&quot;*&apos;government should also be invited to send a representatiythough he doubted if they would accept.In reply to M. Louchsur, he said he would not insion the transfer of the Peace Conference to London.    IfFrench Government would prefer, the London meetings mftake the form of conversations and the formal signatxjPeace could afterwards be carried out in Paris.M. Loucheur said that this consideration would  .great weight with M. Clemenceau. He was leaving for to-morrow and he would do his utmost to indues M./C1to come to London, for conversations. The earliest ^date, he thought, would be December 11th, as M.&apos;Clefthad to be present for the opening of the Chamber-on&quot;\8th, 9th and 10th December.
