  r e s e n tsThe Prime MinistersMr. Bonar LawsSir Robert Horne;Mr. BridgemansSir David Shackleton:Mr. Duncan (Coal Controller)Sir Maurice HankeytMr. Thomas Jones:Members of the Mining Association withMr. Evan Williams as Chairman.NOTES of a Meeting held at 10 Downing Street.S.W.. on W OHESUff* OOTOBBR 27. 1920. at10c 50 a.m.
jf. 9 9Mr EVAN WILLIES:    I should like to say that we had previously called a meeting of the Mine-owners this morningfor 10 0&apos;clock, so that we have not had more than a few minutes conversation between ourselves.THE PRIME MINISTER:    Then your colleagues do not know the position?Mr EVAN WILLIAMS:    No.-   THE PRIME MINISTER:    In that case I had better explainmore fully what the position is.    I am glad to have had this opportunity of meeting you as a body, because we have cometo a point where the Government and the Owners will haveto take a very serious decision.    We have not given our reply to the Miners&apos;  Federation.    We had a meeting of theCabinet last night, and afterwards saw the Miners, andinsofar as we are concerned we have got the full authorityof our colleagues in the Cabinet.    We felt, however, thatthe position must be put before the Mine-owners before we gave a decision, and therefore we have not communicated our decision to the miners.You followed, I have no doubt, the Debate in. Parliament.The most striking feature of that discussion was the pro-posal put forward by Mr Brace, which undoubtedly repre-sented an advance upon anything which up to that momenthad been stated by the Miners. His proposal, that thereshould be an immediate advance, represented, of course, nochange   I mean his statement that they were prepared to revise the 2/- at the end of the year in view of the finan-cial position at that time.    It was, of course,  too vagueto accept.    What we felt was that any revision of wages,which depended upon a long drawn-out argument as to whowas to blame for output and as to the figures here andthere, was something which simply might end in another
quarrel and another strike, and we thought we had betterhave it now than postpone it for another two or threemonths.    We thought that any plan which was mreed uponmust be a plan that would work automatically upon figures which are easily ascertained;    for instance, figures of output, or some figure about which there could be no quarrel,and it should not be open to an argument as to who was to blame, and so lead to prolonged enquiries.    As far as wewere concerned, you may recollect the question which I put to Mr Hodges at the last meeting we&apos;had together.    I asked him:  &quot;If the 2/- is given, what output&quot;, and If the outputdid not materialise, would he be prepared to allow us totake the 2/- off?    He said, No, he would not.    If he had said &quot;Yes&quot;, we all felt at that time that the public wouldnot regard a&apos;strike as justified merely upon the questionwhether the 2/- should be given now and come off if theoutput failed, or whether S^x2 3Exs3suax3b4xfe you should waittill the output materialised and the 2/- given then.    Ytfehave had several meetings with the Miners.   We only met theExecutive yesterday for the first time, but we had first of all the same informal meetings with three or four ofthem as we have had&apos; with Mr Williams and Sir Adam Nimmo,out tney im oaraiijf   uuxu. u.o  unoj  v.wj-^ yi,^.. wj.^------negotiate, although they were willing to give us any information which was in their power.    They were notauthorised to conclude any arrangement on behalf of their colleagues, and- then they arranged with us that a fullmeeting of the Executive should be summoned.    The miners&apos;leaders took exactly the same line.   They said,  &quot;We areonly here to have a free talk, but we are not authorised  -to settle until we have had our full Executive&quot;.    even then, the Executive is not authorised to settle, because-2- ^ &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;N
they nave to see their delegates, and I am not sure if the delegates are authorised, either.    They may have to takeanother ballot.    The negotiations took this form. Theminers&apos; leaders made it clear from the start that it wasno use trying the datum line.    The men took a violent prej-%-dice to the datum line.    As a matter of fact, the miners&apos;leaders never tried to explain it to them, and we all thoughtthat if we butted in and started explaining it to them theywould think we were going behind their backs and trying toget at their men.    The result was that it was never explainedThey thought it was some sort of dangerous animal, or a trap,and they voted against something   which was the datumline   which they had never heard of before.    There is no more conservative person today than the miner of thiscountry.    They made it quite clear to us that whateverproposals were made, whatever modifications were introduced in the figures,  they thought it was hopeless to try and go back to their men on the datum line.    They were a little un-nerved by the defeat which they had. had.    No doubt the ballot was a defeat for the Miners&apos; Executive.    Then some-body suggested that we should get at values.    Then came thequestion, when we got on to values, if we made the 2/-dependent on increase in values two things might happen.The first was that prices would go up in- consequence ofthe shortage-due to the strike.    In such a case they would get their increased pay without any increased output ofcoal, and the public would undoubtedly be very disappointedif that happened.    They would say: &quot;They have their 2/-without working any harder&quot;, and there would be profounddisappointment.    The other thing was equally dangerous,that prices might break;    and, as you all know, that is  cP
by no means improbable, because, as the result of a Confer-ence in which I took part at Spa, the French are pretty wellstocked with coal at present, and the Germans are beginning to deliver coal to them for the first time fairly steadily.That will make a big difference in the open market, I under-stand.    If the miners worked hard and increased the quantityof coal, and, in spite of that, owing to the break in prices,they were deprived of their 2/-, they would all say,  &quot;Well,we have been tricked&quot;.    They would get angry and out of hand,and they wou.ld throw over their leaders.    And although wehave had great difficulties with these leaders, as Mr Williamsknows very well, the second team is much worse than this.I do not know about the other coalfields, but I know in our part of the world the other team would be much more difficult.I do not think there would be.anything to be gained byanything that would make the men feel that they had beendone.    Therefore the proposal was put forward that we shouldsort of stabilise the price upon which we reckon values,taking the price of the September Quarter, and that that-should be the basis of computation.    Also, that we shouldstabilise the amount available for export, because,  they said,&quot;supposing there is a shortage in the home market as aresult of the strike, there may be nothing for export, inwhich case our increased output will be thrown away complete-ly and. there will be nothing left&quot;.    Then we said,  &quot;Very well,let us take the average figure, which I believe is219,000,000 tons of coal that is distributed to the home market, and then treat everything above that as the export,and let us fix the value at the September Quarter prices&quot;.They saw that this was really another way of arriving at thedatum line.   The proposal was that 2/- should be given them,but it should come off at a given date if these figures were
not realised. - I am told that these figures worked out at an output for 2/- of &quot;246,000,000 tons-;    that is, if they do not reach 246,000,000 tons  their 2/- comes off and they drop tols.6d.    If it is 242,000,000 tons they would have the ls.6d.,and if it is 238,000,000 tons  they would have 1/-.    That is how these figures will work out.    It is really the datum lineproposal again.    There is no real&apos; change in the figures,because the question was, - you put 248,000,000 tons  as thefigure before, but it was always a question wfesfear at whatpoint you deduct the first 6d. off.    The 248,000,000 was thedatum, but you had to consider where, between your next figure and your 248,000,000 tons the first 6d. would come off.Therefore you never quite defined what you considered wasin course of materialising   whether it should be 244,000,000,245,000,000, 246,000,000 or 247,000,000.    That had never been settled.    Therefore we have not really departed from the datumline figures.    The only departure is that we say we are pre-pared to recommend to you today that we should say to them&quot;We will give you 2/-, but it must come off automatically ata given date&quot;  I am coming to the date in a short time  &quot;if those figures do not materialise&quot;. &apos; If the output reaches246,000,000 tons it is 2/-;    anything under that, up to242,000,000, it is ls.6d., and then after that it vanishes.That is the scale which it is proposed should be set up.The advantage of this is that it is perfectly automatic. we gave no indication to Mr Smillie whether we would take thefinal terms which were discussed yesterday, but this was thequestion we put to him:    Is it understood that if thesefigures are not reached,  the 2/- will scale down automatically__there was no argument about it   and he said &quot;Yes, thatis understood&quot;.    And the document to be prepared will be basedupon that assumption.    In the House of Commons we said,speaking as a Government, that we were prepared to accept. -5- /&apos; \/ i
or to recommend any scheme where the increased wages had reference to output, and where it was quite clear it was to &apos;come off without ^ going through the process of what theycall &quot;revision&quot;, which means argument which would be. endless.As you know, this has gone on for months, and we could nothave it repeated every time you were to take 6d. off.Wow you come to the question, of output and time.   As faras the nation is concerned, without reference to the partici-pants on both sides of the discussion, what the nation is most concerned about is output.    There is no doubt about thatat all.    It is the general feeling throughout the whole ofthe community.    They are very, alarmed at the very appallingdiminution in the output of a commodity which is more import-&apos;ant than almost any other commodity which is produced bythis country, and certainly more important than any commodityfrom the point of view of Exchanges.    Therefore the nation ismore .concerned about the output of coal than it is about any-thing else, and naturally we, representing the nation, are bound to give first consideration to that point of view.Now the first proposal is this, that there should be adeclaration   and a solemn declaration   in the agreement by both the Owners and the Miners that they will co-operate in the production of more coal.    It is such a seriousnational necessity that I do not think we can face thefinancial outlook without it, especially in view of thefalling demand, from foreign countries for one reason or another   from China because of the silver depreciation;from India because of the monsoons,and various other coun-tries for other reasons.   We cannot face the financialoutlook unless there is a-great increase in the output ofcoal.    It is a grave national need.    Therefore we areconcerned that there should be a solemn declaration by the mine-owners and the Miners at the very outset of the Agreement
that they will both put their backs into increasing theoutput of coal during the next few weeks.    There is no doubt,for one reason and another, that there has been slackness on both sides in the matter of output.    I am convinced of that.There has not been the pressure which you would have had under pre-War conditions, and that is inevitable.    It is nota question of criticism.    There are not the same inducements;there are the guaranteed prices, and other reasons.,there forfeit is vital that we should appeal to both sides that theyshould give.their solemn word of honour to the nation.    Thenation asks this on the honour of both parties, that theyshould discharge this vital national obligation to save thecountry from what may be a very serious financial position.The same appeal has been made in the Continental countries - in Prance and in Belgium.    In Prance there has been a mostremarkable patriotic response to  this appeal.    It has reallysaved Prance from what might have been bankruptcy.    The same 1thing applies to Belgium.    In Belgium they are producing,I am told, more coal than before the War.    Probably that isimpossible here, but I am perfectly certain that with theco-operation of both parties this can be done.    The Miners&apos;Federation are prepared to give that pledge.    It is thefirst time they have given it as a definite solemn pledge.I have no doubt there will be a very considerable section  perhaps not very considerable       but there would be a sectiorwhich, for ulterior motives, will thwart it.    In the main,however, I think the Miners are a patriotic body.    Theyshowed that during the War, and the appeals made to themonce or twice for increased output have been responded to.I think they &quot;would have due regard to their pledged wordto that extent, and especially if that is reinforced by theknowledge that if it is not forthcoming the 2/- will vanishin due course.
Now I come to another proposition where I must ask the Mine Owners to make their sacrifice.     We wereconfronted with one argument which was difficult to answer.     There is a good answer to it when you are dealing with people with whom you can leg argue .   It isvery difficult in the middke of a Strike to combat anappeal which, on the face of it, looks reasonable,,   Youe1have no time to go into details.     This is the argumentwith which we were confronted during the last four days.They said.    &quot;Here you are, you ask us for output.   Wesay *we will give you our word of honour that wo will do our best?   You say you wonIt take it.1     That is what you say to the Miners, but you go to the Mine owners and you ask them to increase output and they say theywill do it, and you take their word.     Why should younot accept the word of the Miners when you accept theword of the Mine Owners?&quot;     That is the sort of argument which is very dangerous when you are dealing with a country where after all three-fourths of the peoplebelong to the working classes.     There is a class of people which would say that we have a class prejudice;that we are taking the word of the Owner and not theword of the Miner.     Then the suggestion was put forward that we should put the Mine Owners in the same category.We had put it before Mr.Evan Williams and Sir Adam NImmobut they both said to us &quot;We are not authorised to give any answer on the subject and you must put it before that we should put the Mine Owners in the same category.Now in this connection there is a 10 per cent which isto be given, under certain conditions, in addition tothe profits -which are distributed amongst the Owners.This is under the Coal Standards Act.     It is proposedour colleagues when they come here&quot;The proposal is
that we should treat that 10 per cent in the same way that we treat the 2/- of the Miners.    If the 246 m&amp;lliontons is reached then the 10 per cent operates;    if itdoes not, then you should fine it down in exactly thesame scale.     Well I know there is an answer to thatwith the Miners this is an additional 2/- which you are giving now, whereas in the other case, it is something-which had been given before;   logically that is so, but you know when you are dealing in a great struggle where you may very well have the Miners and the Transportworkers and the Railwaymen, who hold the vitals of life in this&quot;country in their hands, it is a difficult matter.     They will hold them less after we have carriedthis Emergency Powers Bill through.     It is a dangerousargument and you want to be able to give a simple answer the simple answer is, the Government have to put the mine Owners in exactly the same position as the Miners.*FEORD CORY: A worse position.IB MINISTER:        That is true, but nevertheless, a stronger position.I am not contesting that you would be in a position tosay, at any rate, that they are in the same positionas far as this increase in output is concerned.    their share will scale down -- their advance will scale down -in exactly the same way.     We ask it aoart altogether from the logical considerations or even(logical justice of it.     Mr.Bonar Law has just reminded me of a mostimportant consideration, namely, that we propose a scaleup for the Owners.     We put you in the same categorytreating the 2/- as the corresponding figure to the10 per cent and the 3/- and S/6d. corresponding to the equivalent figures in percentage.   We would, therefore,appeal to you apart from the logical considerations or
that we should treat that 10 per cent in the same way that we treat the 2/- of the Minerse    If the 246 million tons is reached then the 10 per cent operates;    if itdoes not, then you should fine it down in exactly thesame scale.

SIR THOMAS RATCLIFFE-BLLISeven the logical justice, to assist us tc theextent of putting us in that very powerful positionas far as publie opinion is concerned if thestruggle is resumed.     I would not like to predictthat this arrangement will go through tomorrow byany means after the very narrow division which theyhad yesterday.That ten per cent Is ten per cent of the newpool: and not ten per cent of the old pool.SIR ROBERT HORNEThe ten per cent is the surplus as you knowover the pre-war standard.SIR THOMAS RATCLIFFE-ELLISTHE PRIME MINISTER.From today?Yeso     What we proposed to do wasto fix what you were entitled to as at the present time and to draw a line there.     We said that the 2/- would start fromthe time they resumed work     We were prepared, as you&quot;we will date it back to the 1st October if necessary&quot;.     But we have since had a Strike and we have now wiped that all out and we will give them the 2/- from the date they startworkoAfter a short discussion between several of the Mine Owners Representatives   -know, before the Strike, to h^me /THE PRIHE MINISTER;The men suggested that we should give them timefirst of all to get the pits in order.     We alwayscontemplated just the possibility that there might bea ballot because they are by no means united and thereis a very bitter struggle going on amongst them.Therefore we thought that the testing pea?iod reallywould be the end of November and the beginning ofDecember.     That would give time to them if necessary
to get their ballot, to get the p&amp;ts in order and also to make the appeals which they have undertaken to make to their men to co-operate.Well this is the position now which they areprepared to recommend.     They first of all asked that there should be no alteration until thensmeanwhile - and this is part of the bargain which ought to have explained - there should be a committee set up to consider the whole of the wages in theindustry.     I will read it to you&quot;Proceed forthwith to prepare a scheme for submission to the Government at the earliestpossible moment for the regulation ofwages in the industry, having regard, among other considerations,, to the profits of theindustry and the principles upon which any surplus profits are to be dealt with&quot;.That will mean a Committee in which you will bothparticipate and you will try, and agree upon somescheme which you will recommend to the Government0What they really wanted was this.     They said thatthat would take some time and it would not come intooperation before April and they wanted a guarantee of B/- until that came into operation.     That weabsolutely declined to give.     We said &quot;Ho, we are quite willing to take a sir testing period for the2/- but we must know that you are beginning work atonce&apos;.1    At last after a good deal of discussion Ithink they are prepared to recommend this to theirdelegates - that the last fortnight in November andthe first three weeks in December should be thetesting period of the output and that upon the testfigures of the output for those five weeks thequestion of whether the 2/- should remain for January
shall depend.     In the same way the figures forthe January output shall determine what the increase will he for February and so on from month to montheThose five months will not determine for all time thefuture wages.     They will only determine the wages for the subsequent month.     For instance, if theyonly reach 243 million tons they would be down to1/6 and so on to if- - the wages would come downautomatically according to the figures of the output.Yesterday we really broke off because they wanted the 2/- to merge into the new scheme - that is reallywhat they were fighting for - so that it should never come off.     That we absolutely declined.   Wesaid &quot;We must have a testing period and we are quitewilling to give them the last fortnight of December.&quot;They proposed the first three weeks in December.They were insisting upon the whole of the five weeksup to April.     We retired and then upon that therewas a division of opinion amongst them, and they onlycarried a practical acceptance of our extension ofa week by a majority of three.     That is where theyare now and they have agreed upon those conditions torecommend an acceptance of this proposal to their executive.     We have not told them we will take theirextra week so that up till now there is no agreementbetween xksm us and we have got to decide the questionthis morning.Is the comparison with the same period in theprevious year?     The output is always larger before christmas than any time in the year.
THE PRIME MINISTER: It only determines it anyhow for a single monthit only determines it for January.SIR CLIFFORD CORYTHE PRIME MINISTER:SIR T. RATCLIFFE-ELLISrHE PRIME MINISTER:There are regular fluctuations during the year.The principle is that the preceding month shall determine the wage for the succeeding month.    It isa question of the datum line.      If December is a goodmonth you might go up to 246 million tons hutsupposing in January they came down then in february the wage would correspondingly falloWhose figures are we to take in connection withthis automatic arrangement?They will be the figures of the Secretary for mines.;IR. BONAR LAW:THE PRIME- MINISTER:A DELEGATETHE PRIME MINISTER:You may take it as an absolute fact that this isthe datum line camouflaged to please the miners.(Copy of the.document quoted from by Mr*Lloyd George was then handed to therepresentatives of the Mine Owners ).If in looking through the document you thinkthat it is not quite clear enough and you can suggest any amendments we shall be pleased.     With your legalknowledge as well as your knowledge of the trade youwill easily be able to assist us to make this auto-rnatic arrangement quite clear.     In our judgment thatis essential.The five weeks are multiplied by ten in orderto ascertain the rate for the year.Yes.     Fifty is the multiplicand.     Luckilythey did not press for a change of the multiplicand
MOTHER DELEGATE.MR.BONAR LAW:THE BJBIM! MINISTER:THE DELEGATE:THE PRIME MINISTER:MR.EVAN WILLIAMS:THE PRIME MINISTER:Supposing the pool whittled down to nothing, that does not affect our guarantee I suppose?That is not touched at all.It Is the 10 per cent you are putting on the table.What about pay on E89 million tons output?We have not gone beyond 3/^.     If it went further the Miners might ask for more, but I am not anticipatingthat just yet.Has nothing been said about a limit of time duringwhich this shall operate or does it simply go on until a new agreement takes place without question of limitation?That is the advantage of it.      It is something which works automatically so they will have nothing to gain by putting off a permanent arrangement.     Itwill also help when you come to the permanentarrangement, but for the moment it is dependent uponthe work they put in.      I think you may probably nowlike to discuss this amongst yourselves.The Mine Owners then deliberated among themselves.IS- 14.
On resuming:MR. EVANS WILLIAMS:     We have to recognise that time is short, and that you have to meet the Miners1 Federationat 12 o&quot;clock.     We have gone through the proposals, andI think it would not he right for me not to say to you that the Goal Owners as a whole are disappointed at theterms that are now offered to the men, hoth on points ofp.principal and in regard to detail.     As you know, theposition that we took up when we met the men about threeweeks&apos; ago was that we would not give any anticipatoryadvance at all, except upon a clear indication of outputmaterialising, and that is the position which we maintainedas you know right through the negotiations we had with them,and that no doubt contributed very 3argely to the rejection of the terms put forward by the men themselves.     they wanted to get a 2/- advance straight away unconditionally.THE PRIME MINISTER:   Unconditionally.MR. EVANS WILLIAMS:   Yes.    The difference, of course,in our minds at that time was in the nature of the con-ditions.     We maintained that we must see the output before they got the advance, whereas the other class of conditionwas, the advance having been given, that its continuanceafterwas contingent upon output being increased.     We felt/Stefethe Debate in Parliament that that was t he position whichcould not be maintained.     It was a decision which rested with the Government, and it was as a result of that debate that we felt the position could not afterwards be maintained by the Government, as it might have done before.     starting from that point, we feel that the terms which are being offered by the Government now are terms which they havearrived at, having taken everything into consideration nodoubt/
doubt, and which they are prepared to stand by absolutelywithout any kind of giving way again.     J3ut we want to makeit quite clear, both from our own point of view and fromthe point of view of the country, that when this is offered to the men, and when it is put to the public, It should be described as the &quot;Government proposal&quot; and not as the&quot;proposal of the owners&quot;.TEE JrBIMtsi MINISTER:    That is quite right.MR. BVAiiiS WILLIAMS:    I think we are all agreed upon that.     There are two classes of reasons for that view, butthey will be so obvious to you that I need not explain themto you.     It, therefore, resolves itself to our giving youour reply to those parts of the proposal where we are askedto give pledges mi: in regard to our co-operation and ourendeavours to increase output, and do everything in our power,now I am authorised to say   - I am making it very brief -*that in so far as -e^clause- 1. is concerned, the co-operation tothe fullest extent and the preparation of a scheme, are infull accord with our vie\7s.     In effect they go practically no further than we had already gone.iiiow I should like to make an observation in regard tothe preparation of this scheme.     We feel that basing- thewages upon output is a method which no one could think of as being a permanent method upon which wages could be based;that circumstances may arise very soon owing to the fall of export prices and other causes that may make the regulationof wages on this basis very unprofitable to the country as awhole, and we do not want this to continue for a single day.beyond what Is necessary.     It is difficult to say how longa scheme will take to prepare, and It Is equally difficult tosay/
say whether it is possible to secure a scheme after further sittings,,      We should like to feel that thishemethod of wages is to/put an end to at no very distantdate in any circumstances,because it may involve theindustry of the country in paying wages to the minersfar in excess of what the country can afford&apos;to pay.    Ido not know whether it is possible for you now,andwhether it would be wise to fix a date beyond which thisshould not operate, but we think you ought to have it inyour mind that there is some risk.THE PRIME MINISTER:    The miners wanted to put a date ine      There would be no difficulty in getting a date inserted if you desire it, but you must remember that one reason why we were afraid of putting in a datewas that they would say &quot;Here you are no near that date,why should you take the %/- off&quot;.      That is why we didnot put a date in.MR. EVANS WILLIAMS:      We had not time this morning to discuss it.      I only mention it as a point which shouldbe borne in mind.MR,. ARTHUR PEASE:     I understand that if no agreement is come to it goes on indefinitely, and the question ofthe whole trade of the country is so serious   forinstance plates have dropped from  29 to  19 in the last few months,.      There will have to be a radical reductionin wages which will not be a question of 2/-.THE PRIME MINISTER:      That is a different conditionof things.     For instance, supposing the cost of livingwere to go up 5Qfi that does not mean you would rule theminers out.MR. BONAH LAW:
ME. BONAR LAW;      It is pending the preparation oxthe scheme.ICR. EVANS WILLI1MS:      It does mean that if negotiations-ions for a scheme &quot;break down finally, then a new conditionof things arises.      I need not dwell any more on thesetwo points.Now I come to Clause fe)  on the second page, and I amauthorised to say to you that we, as owners, are not. ofcourse in a position to say that we accept these onbehalf of the mine owners, because we have no right to do that.      It affects each individual.      I am sure you wouldnot expect us to accept this on behalf of the mine owners,but we are prepared to recommend xx fully to the trade,the acceptance of these, and we have not the slightestdoubt that when recommended i-t will be accepted as awhole.      Speaking for myself, and I think for the wholeof my colleagues, we think this should have a very greateffect upon the public and upon the men.      The owners areprepared to do their utmost to increase output.     At thesame time the men are also asked to do their share.    Theonly difference as I pointed out during our informal discussions on Sunday and Monday is, that whereas the menare getting something in excess of what they were gettingbefore,  the owners are asked, to give up something whichthey have at the present time.      The Prime Minister hasalready recognised that.      We, as the Central Committeeof the Mining Association of Great Britain,accept theobligation to recommend this fully to our colleagues, tosee that it goes through, and the Central Committee haverepresentatives in every district.     We, recognise thegreat strain that has been put upon you, Mr. PrimeMinister,  during the last few days.      Starting from^-s    the
the position which this matter was brought into afterthe Debate in Parliament, we hajre to feel very thankfulthat we have been able to make such a good fight against the pretentious and claims of the men, becausethe position has been a very difficult one.      We have:got to recognise that if these negotiations breakdown the case which goes to the public is one upon which an absolute stand will be made.      We hope very strongly,indeed we have full confidence, that when theseproposals are put to the men they will be put as theabsolutely final and unalterable proposals upon whichthe Government is prepared to stand or fall.
The only doubt with regard to this document that theowners had was in regard to the commencement, namelyr&quot;The Mining Association and the Mine Owners Federation shallMy colleagues feel that it would be better to have the document worded so that no questions are likely to arise^that these are the owners&apos; proposals when they are submittedto the miners..     The fact of their being put forward as theowners proposals would have the effect of making them less acceptable to the men than if they were put forward as theproposals of the Government.      I am afraid that I have notexplained, myself very clearly, but that is the position which in the short time at our disposal vie have arrived at.I hope I have conveyed the views of my colleagues faithfullyand without any unnecessary elaboration.The Prime Minister, Mr. Williams and Gentlemen, I thankyou on behalf of my colleagues and myself for the patrioticspirit in which you have examined these proposals^&apos;     I am glad to see that the representatives of the Mine Owners&apos;recognise, as we do;, that in a struggle of this characterthe ultimate arbiter is the public opinion of the country,and that if we happen either to make or reject a proposal which does not commend itself to public opinion it is quite impossible to continue the struggle because In the endpublic opinion has a way of imposing itself upon either aGovernment or even upon a great organisation.     Therefore,I am very grateful, speaking on behalf of the Government,for the spirit in which you have met us:.     Yoti showed yourreadiness to make sacrifices for a cause which we all have at hearts      At the time of the Debate in the House ofCommons there was no doubt about the feeling of the Houseitself as a whole and that they were anxious to have asettlement upon these lines - or upon a development of theselines.     Lord Gainford knows how quickly one is able to ,.
gauge the feeling of the House.    It is not manifestin what Is said in debate but it manifests itself in thetalk in the lobbies and elsewhere.    There was no doubtthat the overwhelming sentiment of the House as a result&apos;of that Debate was in favour of a decision more or lessupon these lines, and I think they accurately gauge thefeeling of the cottntry.With regard to the suggestion that the Mine Ownersshould not be a party and that the proposals should comefrom the Government; of course the proposals will comefrom the Government, but we must make it clear that wehave the assent of both parties to the arrangementj that does not mean that both parties would not h&amp;xxEEXEii prefer that the terms should have another form.    The Miners&apos;Federation do not s.accept these because they think it isa settlement which they would prefer.    On the other hand,the Mine Owners would not accept them as proposals whichthey would prefer, but we must have the knowledge that theyare accepted by hoth par ties because they are both involved.We have been thinking of the form in which this might be finally drawn up and it is proposed that we should have asort of pre-amble on the following lines&quot;Recognising that on the increased production of coalthere depend not only the prosperity of all who are engagedin the coal Industry but also the welfare of the-nation&quot;and the cost of life of the people; and having in vie?; thatthis urgent need can only be met if the Miners and MineOwners throughout the country work together cordially forthis crommon purpose:    and further, having regard to thenecessity of setting up machinery for regulating wages Inthe Coal Trade so as to get rid of present anomalies and provide against future difficulties. -The. Mining Association and the Miners&apos; Federation
(The proceedings with the Mine Ownersthen terminated)solemnly pledge themselves to make every effort to achieve these objects.&quot;&quot;To that end they will co-operate&quot; - we leave outthe words &quot;&quot;the Mining Association and the miners Federation&quot;,and then we go on to state that there shall be co-operation and. that the?/ sha.ll forthwith prepare a scheme for submission.We would like to be able to have agreement upon that basisbetween the Government, the Mine Owners and the Miners *Feeler at ion.    I think that is very vital.    As a final word1 would like to say this - the Miners have to summon theirdelegates probably to-morrow - or Friday.   There is&apos;no doubtthey will have a very great difficulty in carrying their scheme and I think it is very important that these conditions should not go out until they meet because if information getsout into the various districts you will have all the collierssaying that this is the darum line over again and. the leaderswill come here and be compelled more or less to reject thescheme.     Therefore, we shall be very much obliged if you willtreat this, In the first instance,  as a Cabinet documentuntil the time comes for us to have an agioed report.
