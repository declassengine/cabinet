Notes of a Conversation between thePrime Minister of Great Britain andthe Prime Minister of Italy held atthe Hotel Crillon, Paris on liOHDAY,August 8th,   1921, at 12.30jL.r,i.PRE SENT:GREAT BRITAIN. ITALY.The Rt,Hon.D.Lloyd George,Prime Minister, GreatBritain,Sir Maurice Hankey.Signor Bonomi,President of the Councilof Italy.ffiarchese della Torretta,Minister of Foreign Affairs.Signor Giuseppe Brambilla,Chef de Cabinet of ForeignAffairs.UPPER SILESIA..     After the usual courtesies Mr. Lloyd George refer-red to the conversation he had had on the previous evening with M. Briand, and. explained the procediirewhich had been agreed to for this afternoon, namely,that the experts of the various Powers should putforward the different points of view in regard, toUpper Silesia.    After that he thought the best plan would be for the Prime Ministers only to retire andhave an informal conversation,      The question wouldthen again be remitted to experts who would be given
do].some hint of the line they should take by theirrespective chiefs.      Prom the point of view of -french public opinion it would be much better that theproposals for a settlement should come ostensiblyfrom a Committee of Experts than from the supreme council.8IGHQR BONOMI th^efwiw agreed with thisatprocedure.    iff. Briand esa the station had mentioned tohim his conversation with Mr. Lloyd George,THE MARCHES! BELLA. TORRETTA intervened at thispoint to explain that he had also seen M, Briand that morning and had found him in a very conciliatory frame of mind.SIGBOR BOHOMI said that he understood that theobject of this first meeting was to discuss thequestion of reinforcements.     How co\i\&amp; this be reconciled with the procedure which Mr. Lloyd. Georgehad outlined?MR. LLOYD GEORGE replied that from hisobservations it seemed that K, Briand was not going topress the question of reinforcements very strongly.Instead of a Division, he was now talking of sendingsome details ruch as machine guns,  tanks, etc.He thought that if the main lines of agreement onthe larger question could be found, not much difficulty need be made by Great Britain in sendingsome small reinforcements of this kind.SIGEOR BONOKI and the MARCHESE DELIA TORRETTAsaid that that was exactly the conclusion at whichthey themselves had arrived.      Italian public opinion,like British public opinion, was strongly adverse tothe despatch of any considerable reinforcements,  buthe thought a concession could be made on this point to help M. Briand provided a settlement were in sighton the main question.
ABGLQ-ITALIAN Hie conversation then took a more generalPOLICY .turn and Signor Bonomi made a statement to theeffect that the policy of the new Italian Govern-ment was strongly in favour of close relations -with Great Britain.SH&amp;NOECB&amp;lSrOMl-EGE : who had insisted thatGreat Britain and Italy must stand firm on thequestion of Upper Silesia explained that this wasa,matter of some difficulty to the Italian Govern-ment for the reason that Prance could make it very&apos; awkward for them in a number-of places such asAlbania and Yugo-Slavia.     nevertheless if hecould go back to Italy and make it clear to thecountry that Italy had close relations with GreatBritain he could risk this.MR. LLOYD GEORGE said that his policy had&apos;always been favourable to working closely with italy, Apart from the historical titsasB and. theinterest which the British people had always felt in the liberation of Italy, the essential factor in the case was that therevwere no points of friction between Great Britain and. Italy.    Hecould not think of a single place where their interests conflicted.      On the contrary it waseverywhere Italy&apos;s interest to work with GreatIBritain and vice versa..      He suggested it would bea good plan before the end of the present conference for a meeting to take place between Signor Bonomi,the Marchese della Torretta, Lord Curzon and him-self with Signor Brambilla to interpret and SirMaurice Hankey, the Secretary to the british cabinet.      This led to his making the suggestionIthat In a few days time the Italian Ministers shouldctisiei with him and Lord Curzon and discuss allthe questions of interest to the two countries,it -  - 3 - ...
 He definitely asked the Marchese della Torretta to let him have a list of the questions which he would wish to discuss.

SIGNOR BONOMIN and the MARCHESE DELLA TORRETTA gladly accepted this invitation, and the Marchese DELLA TORRETTA undertook to let Mr. Lloyd George have the list of questions at an early date.

MR. LLOYD GEORGE said that in former days he had been in the habit of discussing all these matters very closely with Signor Nitti. After his leaving office, however, he had never found it possible to resume conversations on the same footing with Count Sforza. It had been rather like trying to talk to Mont Blanc. He had never really succeeded in having a heart to heart talk with Count Sforza. Consequently he had got rather out of touch with the Italian point of view in some questions, - for example, on the question of Albania.

THE NEAR EAST, TURKEY AND GREECE.

This led to a certain amount of conversation in regard to the Near East, and Italy&apos;s relations to Turkey and Greece.

THE MARCHESE DELLA TORRETTA said that on assuming Office one of his first acts had been to reverse the strong Turco-phil policy of his predecessor and to give instructions to Constantinople that the Italian representatives were to wok closely with their Allies. He hoped that Mr. Lloyd George had already seen the results of this.

MR. LLOYD GEORGE agreed that he had and thanked the Marchese for what he had done.

THE MAECHESE BELLA TORRETTA continuingsaid that as an Italian he would prefer that therehad never tees sugh people as the Greeks, hut sinoethefcja weiseAit was necessary to work with them andhis aim was to reach an understanding.MR. LLOYD GEORGE: said he thought that theBritish Government could assist in this.There was then some conversation in regardto the position in Turkey and the   MARGHESE BELLATORRETTA agreed with Mr, Lloyd George that theobject of the Allies should be to restore theposition of the Turkish Government at constantinople and to deal with them rather than with Angora.The Marchese Stella Torretta   however consider-ed that in order to strengthen the position of theTurks at Constantinople, it was desirable to give them some territorial extension.MR. LLOYD GEORGE said that this was no longer possible-, after the Greek victories.     The allies would have no right now to ask the Greeks to retire from Smyrna; even if they wished to do so it wouldnot be easy to enforce it.     Ear from strengthening the position of the Turks in the region of theStraits he thought it would probably be necessary to let Greece occupy the Dardanelles^   It was impossibleto allow the Turks to keep it after what had. happen-ed in the late war.   Choice therefore was betweenits occupation by the Allies and. the Greeks.   He was told that the Allies would require two divisions forthe purpose.     This they could not spare.    GreatBritain certainly would not continue paying 4,000,000 a year for the maintenance of their forces at Constantinople, and he did not think the prench or the Italians would either.     In thesecircumstances the best plan seemed to be to let
the Greeks occupy the Dardanelles.    There wasnot the same objection to the Greeks occupying itas to the Turks.     If the Greeks ever threatened to close the Straits the Allies could immediatelyput pressure on them at Athens.    The TurkishCapital at Constantinople %iras behind the starits and if the Turks closed the Straits they alsoshut off their Capital from Allied reach.SIGHOR BONOMI&apos; and THE MARCHESE DELIATORKSTTA without saying anything very definiteshowed from their manner that this proposal wasnot very acceptable to them.    Shortly after themeeting came to an end the Marchese della Toreettapromising to send Mr. Lloyd George a list of subjects for discussion with the Italian pointof view where necessary.
