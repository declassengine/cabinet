Kal OR.ercpouIqs said that the  vhole people o f Oreoce would,fl grateful for that declaration and. that he would soraraunicaw oc&amp;formed at once in reply to enquiry, lionsieur Kalogoropoulos said that it was hisassign to find out if the British Government had any desires or advice toir-3 the Greek Government,      It was the wish of Greece that all theBrangomonts provided for in the Treaty, which would give peace to thoast, should be maintained,. but the Greet Government was anxious to hoarther tho. British -Government&apos; -had any advice to give it.The Prime -minister  asked whether Greece was able- to defend its newIssosslons against any attacks which might be made upon it.,do1    jgonsisur ICalegeropuulas said that iCiustapha Kemal could/nothing in grade and that he was -convinced that the Greek Army could scatterpstapha kemal as soon as it was given the right to do so by the AlliedB&apos;n-s, who had the. right to give or withhold that permission.    Once10 ^ra-ilists had boon scattered the Greeks could maintain in SmyrnaI30 divisions oarmanontly, and in addition, if necessary,  could sendI * Arthur divisions.    So far as the maintenance of the    Greek posses-^3 in Smyrna and    Thrace were concerned, Greece was absolutely one andme ...inister said that if Mansieur kalogeropoulos did&apos; not wish   &apos;&apos; s.o, he would not press him for an answer at tie moment as he .nightto consult 1 is &apos; Government before giving one, but the suggestion had-^do that the road to  oeace. might bo- eased by making Smyrna anaoii;oa3 province with a Christian .  .   .  .   .............
Governor appointed by the Allies and aoparate from Athena,     Thesuggestion, in fact, was to apply to Smyrna the system which had previously been adopted in the case of Eastern Rumella, and. whichin this case, as in. that, would nrobably end in complete inoorpora-ticn with Greece.      The defence of the province would then reston local levies- and Greek troops could only bo introduced at the call of the Allied, and &apos;in tho event of a Turkish invasicn.Lions ieur Kalegeropoulos    said that he would &quot;have to consult his Government /before, giving any answer, but he would like to sayimmediately that tho situation in Smyrna had already been tiansfor-mod through the. introduction of -a Greek administration.    law andorder had been established, and the population which had previous-ly been driven away by the Turks was now returning.     Everybody ini-      &apos;.&apos;:   &apos; situfeiiicn :     &apos; - &apos; -Smyrna now admitted, that the  TrJ .y&apos;.was greatly improved...    If,however., the Greek Army were compelled to withdraw, disorders wouldprobably -ensue ,      Further., once the Greek Army was withdrawn, itwould bo a -very difficult thing to re in traduce it again..     Ha couldnot disguise tho fact that there were other powers, by which heclearly meant the Italians, who were engaged in an active propagandathere in favour of the Turks against the Greeks...   - The majority ofthe population was Greek, but there was a largo Turkish minoritywhich outside propaganda couSd work upon.      The withdrawal -of theGreek Army, therefore, would make the autonomy of Smyrna verydubious.-   $be Prime&apos; Minister ^ said that as far as he could ascertain., theKe ma list demands -we to that both Smyrna -and Thrace should be re turnerto Turkey,   ...Monsieur ;Kg, 1 oaeioyoul&amp; replied &apos; that :suc:h. a. thing would boabsolutely impossible.      The Greeks would&apos; never agree to that soleng as they could resist it..  The Prime Minister said that he was glad to hear this and thatLhe relied upon tho spirit of the Greek people -not to surrenderlegitimate r-ights.      At the same time.,it- would, help the BritishGovernment if the Greek Government could find.: some way of making     if
concession about Smyrna^    Jiom the.point of view of Greece, itculd bo a groat pity if the Conference broke down because  the -Q racksmro unieascnably unyielding-      If. tho Conference is to break down,t &apos;./ould be far better it should do so by * mr -oaeenablenoos on thearks, for in that case,  if Greece had boon wxllxug to agree to areasonable corcrremise, they would bare the Allies on their side,Tho Prime iiinxstur then explained to monsieur Kal-jgeioooul; sthe proposed procedure and said that, the Conference would. probus ,y.oar the Turks first, but would then communicate- to- i.ionsieur.
