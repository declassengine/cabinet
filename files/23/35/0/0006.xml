Clemenoeau, con-taining proposals as to the heads of a Treaty of Peace with turkey on the alternative hypotheses (i) that the Sultan andthe Turkish Government were to be expelled f^ovs Constantinople(11) that they were to re ain there (Appendix).H. Eerthelofs scheme for the first alternative did not differ substantial!? frota the goint scheme prepared by him in concert with Lord Curzon.    His proposals for the  sec or-.&apos;.. -i- -vl:
(a It e &quot;&quot;native were generally criticised en. the ground that theywere unnecessarily harsh to the Turks.It was felt that it would be desirable that the BritishGovernment should prepare their own scheme, based on thehypothesis that the Sultan and the Turkish Government we *e tore-tain in Constantinople.It was agreedThat the Secretary of State for India should,draw up, for the consideration of the primeiiiniater and hie colleagues, the heads of aTreaty of Peace with Turkey, based on theassumption that the Sultan and the Govern-jent of Turkey would remain in Constantinople.It was further agreed -That, in order to assist I-ir Itontagu in thefinancial aspects of the. question, IIr ArraitageSmith,  of the Treasury, should be surxwoned bythe Prise Minister to Pa &quot;is.Pa&quot;is,January 11, 193C
\Sf*- J^Xt&quot; b-oakin8 the peace and the treaties, whloh_.affsared-.itsF^/^territcrial integrity and its sovereignty, Turkey has freedthe Allied Powers from every other obligation other than res-poet for the guiding rules of their own policy, which are best-,besides in accordance with the general p-inciples of Justice.In closing the Straits Turkey kaus ont the comraunications ofRussia with the Allies, caused Russia&apos;s political and militarydissolution and prolonged the War with all its disasters; -sucha catastrpohe oarmot be allowed to be renewed.The following principles appear to be those which should govern the settlement of the Eastern question.1. The xcaintenance of an independent Turkish State, composedof the Provinces in habited by a majority of Turkish elementsand placed under the sovereignty of the Sultan,  remains dec-id-ed.S. lies mandates and no spheres of political influence willbe accorded to any specific power in the Ottoman Emplfe asconstituted by the provisions of the Peace Treaty.3. Turkish militarism will be suppressed like Prussianmilitarism:    neither the Turkish Army nor the Turkish Fleetwill be maintained.4. The absolute freedom of the Straits will be ensured:guardianship over them, from tho Black Sea to the mediterranean-nean, will bo entrusted to an international organisationsafeguarding the effective neutrality of the passage.5. The Armenians will be entirely free from the Turkishdomination and constituted as an independent State,S. The Arab and Syrian populations cannot be replacedunder the Turkish Yoke.7. The rights of minorities represented by numerous peoples of different race and religion will be scrupulously guarantee:
by a special Treaty placed under the specific guardianship of the League of Nations, which will affirm their right to keep their civil and religious status, their educational and philanthropic establishments and complete political equality.

?. The reform of Turkish administration (Administration, Justice, Finances Genda?meric) will be guaranteed by the control of the interested Powers.

Peace with Turkey offers four principal problems:

A. Constantinople and the Straits.

B. Anatolia and Asia Manor.

C. Ar?enis.

D. Syria, Mesopotamia and Arabia.

A. CONSTANTINOPLE AND THE STRAITS.

Two solutions are possible: the maintenance of the sultan at Constantinople or the expulsion of the Turks from Europe.

From the point of view of ethics and history the eviction from Europe of a State which has remained barren and inoanable of progress, and is based on the right of conquest and the oppression of different races and superior civilisations, represents a victory for Right. Moreover, the less of Constantinople would mark in Moslem eyes the definite eclipse of that mysterious power which the possession of Constantinople entrusted to the descendants of Osman over the Moslem peoples dependent on England and France. The capture of ? by the Turks marked the end of the ?  ? ex due from Constantinople would sig? the the birth of a new epoch. To these arguments of philosophy one may ? the difficulty of guarding the Straite without a considerable military force and without a very large expenditure if Constantinople and its 800,000 inhabitants remain in the hands of the Sultan and consequently with in the of the intrigues of a Germany
???

The doctrine of the maintenance of the Sultan at Constantinople has numerous supporters, especially in France, because the development of the latter&apos;s material and moral interests in Turkey is larger, than that of any other. Power, (although England had in 1913 more than a quarter of the whole trade of Turkey and more than double that of any other Power). France possesses in Turkey the bulk of railway capital and of under-takings of private and public interest, in which, before 1914, she had invested more than three milliards; she possesses  a great part of the. Ottoman Public Debt, and had exercised a preponderating influence in the administration of the so-called assigned revenues and in that of the tobacco Regie.  Her moral influence Was safeguarded and propagated by hundreds of school and philanthropi? institutions, religious as well as secular, distributed throughout the towns of the Ottoman Empire. The continuance of the old Turkey is for the rest a system the  simplicity of which pleases many practical-minded men, and which may appease the susceptibility of a re-constituted Russia Even in England a large number of those interested in politics, impressed by consideration for the Moslems of India, are opposed to the idea of removing the Knaliph from his secular Capital. Lastly, the military leaders of the Allied Powers and the Allied Commissioners at Constantinople are unanimous in drawing the attention of the Heads Of their Governments to the growing power of nationalist feeling in Turkey, to the organisation of the Army of Mustapha Kemal in Anatolia, to the weakness ? owing to demo?ilisation  of the Allied forces on the spot, and of other available troops, and to the extreme difficulty, perhaps the impossibility, of making the Turks accept, without a large military Expedition, the decision of the Allies, which is to expel from Europe the Ottoman Empire and Khaliph.

In view of the considerable weight behind each of these two ? theories there would appear to be room for contemplating successively both hypotheses.


&amp;f1. The establishment of a State of Constantinople andthe Straits.In the event of the Powers -deciding to drive back theOttoman State into Asia in order to ensure the freedom of theStraits, it would be possible to create a State of Constan-  iftinople and the Straits, comprising in Europe the territory   .1situated between the Sea of Marmora and the line Enos-Midia   j](or confined to the Ghatal^a lines) ----- and in Asia only the   jAsiatic shore of the Straits of the Boephorus (with a frontier running from Shile on the North to Tsmld&apos;on theTenedos and following a line about CO kilometres from, theana (sic)coast),  the Asiatic ehvPothe Sea of Marmora remainingTurkish.    All the Islands between the Dla-k Sea and theMediterranean        d be included in the State.The new State would be placed in a general \?,y under thehigh protection of the League of Nations ,    It would beneutralised.    The fortifications wculd be destroyed (to an extent to be fixed by a Military end Na^el Inter-allied commission), and a acne to a depth of bC kilometres wouldbe da-militarised on the- Asiatic sk-es.The a demist ration of the State would at first be organ-ised and directed by a Government Commission (&quot;Commission deOr ouve me me nt&quot;)representing the most interested Powers.This Commission weald be composed of two delegates of eachof the great mediterranean Prwers (France, England, Italy) -to which could be added /subsequently the United St at en ifit desires to- participate, and Russia, as scon as the latterPower should ha\e been entirely re-constituted) and onedelegate for Greece, one for Rotmania and ultimately one for Turkey,In the event of.a persistent difference - of opinion between the members of the Commission the question a tissue might be carried, by a vote cf two-thirds of the delegates, before the Council of the League of NationsSouth) and of the Darddanelies (with a frontier running from
ti1The Chairman of the Commission would hold office for twoconsecutive years:    he would be alternatively French andpredominantEnglish, on account of the -material, intellectual and moralinterests cf France and England in the Ottoman Empire.The Chairmanship might, however, after a period of eight years, be entrusted to one of the other Great Powers towhom the Chairmanship would fall by rotation by a vote oftwo-thirds of the members of the Commission,The Commission would establish the necessary adtninistra-tion3 and regulations, would nominate Government officials and would examine a draft constitution as well as a judicialsystem to bo submitted to the Council of the League ofNations.The administration would be made as simple as possible,and the Departments reduced to the following:(a) Ministry of the Interior (including Phhlio Works,Bdu.cat3.on, Health, Posts and Telegraphs);(b) Ministry of Finance (and Commerce);(c) Ministry of Justice;(d) Ministry of Pefenc-e (and Peace).Iho Commission would exerciDO the command over themilitary and naval forces charged with fc-hs policing theState of Constantinople and guarding the Straits.,    Thointerest edstrength of these forces would be fixed by the/principal allied Powers, and might be eventually modified subse-guenfcly.by the Commission.Those fcross would consist chiefly of a gendarmerie on land,  fa,nd a Kaval Defence force (both Inter-Allied), their strength being such as to enable them to keep order andresi3t a sudden attack coming whether from Europe or fromAsia sufficiently long to allow the Fnglish and FrenchFleets to Intervene.
The State would receive,-within a period and in a formcompatible with the general organisation of its administration, elective institutions placed under the guarantee ofthe League of Nations.   All residents in the State wouldenjoy complete civil and political equality whatever might&apos;be their race or religion.
Should the resources of the State be insufficient atfirst to defray the expenses of its Administration (which ex-penses would have to he carefully reduced to a minimum)the ujF-keep of naval and military forces, its own share of the OttomanDebt and the obligations undertaken&apos; by Turkey,the Powers repre-sented on the Commission for Government would have to consider how best they could assist it, either by means of money advances,&apos; orby the transfer of other guarantees to- turkey creditors.From the religious point of view, all mosques-would be respected.     St, Sophia alone would be set apart and respected asa monument of antiquity, no religious services being allowedtherein (unless services of various religions were celebratedthere turn about).The Commission for Government of the State of Constan-tinople and the Straits would be entirely independent of theOttoman State in Asiatic Turkey and would take no part in the supervision excercised by the Powers with regard to the finance,justioe and gendarmerie of such State, which would be sovereignand independent.All care would be taken when transferring the seat ofgovernment from Constantinople and detaching the same from theTurkish State, all facilities being given, to retiring high offi-officials and the task of provisioning and supply being carried outwith care.        The principles laid down by the Allies with re-gard to reparation would be applied to the personal property ofthe Sultan as well as to private property in Constantinople and throughout the whole of the new State,2)     Constantinople to remain as capital of the TurkishState.Should this be the ca.se, the general principles setforth above would apply to European Turkey. as well as to.theremainder/
soreminder of the Ottoman Empire in Asia, It would only be neces^gary to provide for if-a) an Interallied force of about 30,000 men (one third each -being supplied by the French, the English, and the Italians).   Itstasjc would be to guarantee the absolute liberty of the Straits andto occupy the points decided on by military experts, but whichshould not include Constantinople, where no Turkish troops couldbe maintained, other than the Sultans small personal Guard.b) the limitation of the Turkish State in Europe to a veryrestricted hinterland to the capital, which should not fro; beyondthe Chatalja lines, (to which Greek sovereignty would extend), to balance its limitations in Smyrna),p in order to respect the prin-ciples of nominal Turkish sovereignty and to facilitate the-with-dra^al of the Italian troops of occupation.o) application of administrative reform and of Allied con- -tro], over the State of European Turkey.d.) the proposed formation of an &quot;International Straits Com-pany&quot;, to be formed by the fusion of the French and foreign Com-panies interested in all matters concerning navigation, in theStraits.      The inevitable development of traffic throughout theEast after the conclusion of peace makes it possible to considera scheme which would permanently internationalize communications between the Aegean and the Black Sea. &apos;   Such internationalization,cannot fail to facilitate the settlement of questions concerning :tho Jiinterland of th&amp;se communications by sea.The Board of the Company would be assisted by a Commission ,composed of delegates of the interested Powers (or their repre-eentatives at Constantinople), which would form a Supervisory Com-mission.        The funds required to defray the expenses of such a company would be furnished by supplementary taxes on navigationand trade, which, would be settled by international agreement,B) Anatolia...
B. Anatolis and Asia Minor.

The Ottoman Empire, Whether existing in Europe or not, will continue to exist Asia Minor under the national Os?anli dynasty

Its territory will be bounded as follows:-

1. To the north, by the Black Sea as far as the Lazistan frontier (to be assigned to Georgia) to the east of Trebizond.

2. To the West (by the enclaves assigned to the State of Constantinople on the borders of Asia, of the Bospborns, and of the Dardenelles), or by the Asiatic side of the Straits and of the Sea of Marmora, then by the Mediterranean as far as the ? Silician frontier (the Lama-su River).

3. To the south by the course of the Lama-su, the Chamarlu Dagh, the division of the rivers beyond Bulgar Dagh, as far as Uch Kapular Dagh, then a line corresponding to the boundaries of the vilayets and marked out by the Ki?il Dagh, the Hezanli and the Belli Gedik Dagh, as far as the ? then the course of the latter and that of the Euphrates downstream as far as the boundary of the vilayets of Mamuret-ul-Aziz and the Diarbekir then the boundary of such vilayets as far as the Upper Euphrates(Murad-su) and thence downstream until its juncture with the Munzur su.

4. To the East along the Munzur-su as far as its source and along the Munzur Dagh, then by a line starting from, the eastern end of the Munzur Dagh (Merjan Dagh) rejoining the Black Sea to tho east of Trebizond by the Kara Dora River, this town being left to Turkey together with Erzinjan and the road which runs between the two  and also Kharput.  Erzerum would belong to the now Armenian State and Argaha-Maden to the territory for which the French will receive a mandate.

The capital (in which the Sultan would reside) would either be Koniah, Angora, or Broussa (if-Constantinople were not retained/
retained as capital).

The Ottoman Empire would retain its parliamentary institutions, which would be adapted to new circumstances by the following reforms:-

1. Military and naval reforms. The Turkish Army and Navy to be done away with, as well the Ottoman War and Naval Ministries. The Turkish Gendarmerie would be reinforced , commanded and instructed by Allied instructors, and placed under the authority of the Ministry of the Interior.

2. Legal reforms. The Ottoman Court to be re-constituted an Inter-allied Commission, the seat of which would be in Turkey, and which would make use of the work already done in this direction by the Paris Conference and the Allied Delegations in Constantinople.

After the application of these reforms, the Capitulations (which would remain in force during the interregnum) would be abrogated.

3. Financial reforms. It will be impossible for Turkey to carry out ? obligations to the Allies without financial control, or even to exist; supervision of all sources of revenue and of the distribution of income are equally necessary.   An Inter-allied Commission (composed of French and English t representatives, Italy having no Turkish interests and not having declared war on Turkey, which means that no war expenditure has been incurred by her in that country. She will therefore have very little to claim before the Reparations Commission, as her nationals have suffered no damage). ? be entrusted with preparing

these/
these reforms and organizing supervision by the Powers on the fol-lowing basesa).   The Interallied Commission of Control shall hixdniktJammhsS: concern itself both with finance and with currency.   TheOttoman Budget and all financial laws shall be submitted to it for approval before being laid before the Ottoman Parliament.The Commission shall be charged with all currency ques-tions and shall supervise all State payments.b)     The former Administration of the Ottoman public debt, which has shown proof of integrity and usefulness and which represents the interests of foreign holders, shall have its powers extended and shall be entrusted with the collection of taxes.     For this purpose it shall be attached to the TurkishMinistry for.Finance and shall be given instructions by theInterallied Commission of Control.     It will be difficult to alter the present rules and regulations for the administration ofthe Ottoman Public Debt, seeing that they are the result of anagreement between its creditors and the Ottoman State made withthe approval and sanction of the Powersit would be unable toact without the revenues at piesent grantedcIt will in all probability have its principal offices atConstantinople.
4. ? Administrative control will be ensured by the presence of three Delegates (English, French, Italian) whose counter-signature will be necessary, in each Ministerial Department(except the purely political ? such as the Grand Vizirate and Foreign Affaires). The Controllers will meet in Council twice a no nth under the presidency of the Grand Vizier to ?remine administrative and financial questioins.

5. Protection of  Minorities. The particular rights of the numerous populations of different race and religion,  scattered in Asia Minor, will be guaranteed by a special treaty fr?med in accordance with the principles  adopted in Trooties for the Protection of Minorities already  signed in 1919 (by Poland, Czecho-Slovakia,  Rou?snia, Serbia, Greece), but adapted to the special needs of Turkey.

This Treaty will establish for these populations the right to preserve their civil and religious statue, their scholastic and hospital establishments, and even, if this seems convenient, their jurisdiction so far as concerns litigation arising in each community in connection with civil and religious status, the persons concerned being entitled in case of need to choose between their special tribunals and the new tribunals whose organisation is proposed.

The exercise of these rights will be guaranteed by the international control of Turkin reform and by the intervention of the League of Nations, which must be carefully defined.

6.  Situation  of Europeans.

(a) Grook  Occupation of Sm?. The Greek troops have occupied Smyrna in consequence of the decision of the supreme council,
Council, which was due to the disorder and abuses which reigned there, and must only leave the town gradually.

It will be necessary, while respecting the nominal Turkish sovereignty and assuring full liberty of commerce in this port of exit which is so important in Anatolia, to assure a special position for the Greeks in the administration of the town Smyrna. This port will be constituted a free port, under Inter-Allied control.     Greece will receive a predominant part in the exercise of military and judicial control in the Sandjak of Smyrna, with the exception of tho financial control established for the whole of Turkey which must not be sub-divided.

On the other hand Greece ? should receive compensation in Europe by the attribution to her in full sovereignty of Adrianople and ?race , up to the Enos-Midia line, the frontier of the State cf Constantinople, perhaps even up to the line of T?hataldja, access to the sea being assured to the ? under the control of a European Commission.

The Greeks would in addition have a share in the governing Commission of Constantinople (in the case of a separate state being constituted there) and will receive doubles? the Dodocanese and Cyprus.

(b)Italian Occupation of Southern. Anatolia. (Scala-Nova, Adalia, Ko?ia). The Italian troops, who are provisionally in occupation of a part of Asia Minor, have not been summoned there by the Allies and have on the contrary called forth written observations by the British, American end French Governments, and a refusal by the Conference to recognise  the legitimacy this occupation.

The withdrawal of these troops will in addition be easily obtained, as well as that of the Crock troops, in consequence of the organisation of the Ottoman State of Turkey in Asia and the control exercised ever it by the Great Powers.

The
The Italians, who have nafte an agreement with the Greeksfor the return of the Dodocarese, sad who will hive a share in the governing Commission of the State of Constantinople, asI pell as in the financial,  judicial and military control offckey in asia., will receive as compensation for the withdrawalIof their soldiers economic advantages ?/hich ni\ht caicict in a&quot;   gright of priority over all commercial enterprises in SouthernAnatolia as well as in a Franco-Italian -agreement for the coalni no s of He r e,e e la(c)    The French&apos; eccrapation in Syria-Gllioia which is the resultI of an Ancrlo-^rench agreement and of decisions of the Conferenceimplies for strategic and economic reasons the possession ofUho pasoesesf the Taurus; the historical defence of&apos;Syria,,    TheFrench Government is disposed to organise the  administration ofOilicia in such a way as to ,..^isure to the Turkish majority ofthe population, as well as to the Armenian minority, their rights and the largest measure of protection.;0o     Armenia will he constituted a completely independentRepublic under the high protection of the League of Eat ions.It will be composed essentially by the re-union ofthe Russian Armenian Republic (which comprises about one and a half million of.^Amoriioas ) and of the former Turkish Armeniawhere it will bo necessary to bring back the greatest possible number of the five hundred thousand Armenians dispersed in asia Hi nor , at Constantinople, in the United States, in Persia,in Bulgaria -etc.     In this way there will be degrees be reconstituted in reasonable limits, what was formerly the kingdom, of Great Armenia;    it nay be remarked, that of ail theStateo which are endeavouring to establish control on theRussian frontier, 0:1 independent Armenia, is that which theRus russians
 Russians are most prepared to recognise.

The territory of the Republic of Armenia, would comprise:

(1) The existing territory of the Armenian Republic of Erivan, including the districts of Bochelie, of Upper Kanbak and Zanguezour, which are at present contested by the States of Georgia and Azerbaijan;

(2) The Turkish Empire, the eastern portion of the Vilayet of Erzeroum including the town and district of Erzerum, the plain of Mouch, the district of Bitlis, and the region of Lake Van, up to the Persian frontier. The frontiers of Armenia with the Republic of Georgia and Azerbaijan, with Turkey, with the French zone of ?, will be traced on the spet by an Inter-Allied Commission.

The Council of the League of Nations will be charged to take action in order to give to the Republic of Armenia the assistance in relation to supplies and money which one ? might attempt to obtain from the public and in particular the American public by interesting them in the fate of these unhappy peoples.

A force which may be estimated at a minimum of five thousand and a maximum of twenty thousand men, to be organized in mixed detachments, seems necessary for the maintenance of order in Armenia. This force might be organised by officers supplied by the Allies, under the direction of the League of Nations, which would act by means of voluntary recruiting.

Since the territory of Armenia has no direct access to the sea, or at least does not include any port, the relations of the new state to the other countries will be assured by transit
 transit conventions between Armenia and the states which surround it, and by the establishment of Batoum as an independent free city, under the guardianship of the League of Nations. This constitution, similar to that of Danzig, would guarantee to Armenia and to the Republics of Georgia and Azerbaijan the use of the port of Batoum.

Armenia would be directly connected with this port, which is its natural outlet, by being linked up to the Tauris-Djoulfa-Chakhtakti-Bouddachine Railway, by a branch line between Tauris, over the mountain chains of Northern Persia, and the Black Sea. Armenia would also be connected with Constantinople towards which the traffic of its valleys was directed in the nineteenth century, by the linking up of the line from Erzerum to Angora, and with the Mediterranean by a branch line towards Alexandretta, which would be connected with the line from Baghdad by Diarbekr and Mardin the existing southern terminus.

The idea has been considered of attaching the Greek province of Pompus to Armenia, and giving it Trebizond as an outlet but this solution will not stand examination, for in the Vilayet of Trebizond, the Mahomedan element represents 80% of the population and the country must remain Turkish as even the Greeks are of opinion. The construction of a railway from Erzerum to Trebizond is practically impossible in consequence of the mountainous character of the country and in addition such a line would never pay expenses.

The great difficulty in establishing Armenia is that the Armenians practically nowhere constitute a majority;  the great objection to attributing to them countries such as Cilicia where there is a strong national nucleus situated more than four hundred kilometres from Armenia, is that such an extension
extension would certainly re.se.lt in placing the Armenians ina-a definite minority in the-.tr state and that when a genuineconsultation of the-inhabitants took placo they would electa,, majority of represent at ires hostile to the Armenians.     one must never lose sight of the fact that it is further from the historical Armenia to the Mediterranean than  ron 3witzerlandto Cette and that there are on the way only isolated groups of. Armenians in a &quot;population with an enor mons majority, andimplacably ho stileg     Reality and logic, are equally opposedto the &quot;dream of a great Armenia str etching from Trebizond toAloxandrottaoBut in order to create the. united Armenia which we havedefined, of which half (Turkish Armenia) is, still only atheoretical conception, it will he necessary first of all toprotect the grouped elements of Russian Armenia against aTartar and Kurdish population which is extremely hostile., then to   bring back into Armenia from the four corners of Turkey andthe world several hundred thousand of Armenians who arescattered and little inclined to leave their businesses, to sponc&quot;hundreds of millions to rebuild the dostroye&quot; villages, toremake the roads, to re c on struct, the railways, to ensure the feeding of the population in a region which is absolutely-ruined and deserted, and finally to defend the new inhabitantsagainst an energetic Zur do-Trade ish population which liasseisedjj&amp;gx^T^aip: the land, a task which is particttlsrly difficultbee aii se the long si a very which fgarKfrr-^na^^Armenia has suffered has deprived her of confidence in herself-.With the a s si stance of America and of the league of Hat ions this problem which is very difficult, even in the most reduced form,--can no doubt be resolved.
