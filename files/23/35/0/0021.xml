-PHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY * S GOVERNMENT oGoal Striked /Note of a conversation held at 10, Downing Streeten October 25th 1920 at 10.45 a.moPresenfcoThe Prime minister mr.Bonar LawSir Robert HomeSir Erie GeddesMr oBridgmanMr * A oR .Dun c anSir MoHankeyoMr oToJones.Part of the time:MroEvan WilliamsSir Adam Niramo.The Prime Minister, addressing the two coal owners present, said that according to his information the minersr leaders would not accept a settlement on the output basis.     The Executive wouldbe bound to reject it or refer it to a fresh ballots   A more hopeful line was on the basis of values with output camouflaged^Sir AoNiramoj    &quot;We do not want an arrangement which would put themen in a mess in a months&quot;   &quot;The position is so uncertain thatyou are riding for a fall at the end of Novembero   You cannot get the  3,000,000 extra values from exports.&quot;The Prime Minister:    &quot;The men would consider themselves tricked. Wecould say - 8We are afraid prices may break9 - and if they did themen would say     8We have been tricked8.   They would turn on theGovernment and say we cannot trust the government   I suggestthat we should add an alternative that if values do not reach acertain point and output does, the increase in wages should begiven on the outputo&quot;Sir AoNiramo;    &quot;I do not think we could quarrel with that&quot;MreBonar Law;    &quot;You realise the meaning of the Prime Ministersalternative?   The public will say that we are giving them concessions in two forms and that we are therefore defeated.&quot;Hie Prime Minister:    &quot;If the men increase their output the public will be willing to pay.   You are not sure of getting a settlement on;to the output basis alone, hence my alternative.   I am not afraid ofthe publie if we have got a rational scheme0&quot;Sir Robert Home:    &quot;The men have been asking for a share of the pool and we have taken the line that the pool was temporary and that we could not calculate what It might be.&quot;Mr*Bonar Law:    &quot;It would be said that the reason why we gave them the alternative was our fear that output will not beincreased^- SBOHSTSo20o
The Prime Ministers    &quot;But if the men feel themselves tricked bytheir leaders we shall be left with a mob to deal witha&quot;Mr Evan Williams o    &quot;It is important in our view that theledders should be trusted by the mem&quot;MroBonar Law:    &quot;Why not try our offer on output plus a reductionin masters&apos; profits?Sin AoKimmo:    &quot;You have an element of elasticity by having a margin on the output before you lower the wage and you have equality of sacrifice from owners and men from a givenline,&quot;The Prime Minister: &quot;It is not a question of the reasonableness ofour output proposals but of the psychology of the men*The Prime Minister then read aloud the draft whichhad been handed to the 4 officials of the miners federation on Sunday October 24th, and he pointed out that there were certain vitalfigures to be incorporated in this draft.Draftolo    The Mining Association and the Miners&apos; Federationshall:(a) co-operate to the fullest extent to obtain increased output and for this purpose will arrange to set upN District Committees aid a National Committee:(b) proceed forthwith to prepare a scheme for submission to the Government for the subsequent regulation ofwages advances in the Industry having regard among other considerations to the profits of the industryand to the principles upon which the surplus profits of the industry are to be dealt with between the producers (including employers and workmen) the consumers and the State:2b       Pending the preparation of such a scheme as is referred to in 1 (b) wages shall be regulated onthe following basis:-(a) an advance of 2s. a day to persons of 18 and overa shilling to persons of 16 and 17 and 9do to persons under 16 will be paid from the date ofresumption of work to the classes of colliery workersentitled to Sankey wage and subject to the conditionunder which Sankey wage is payable:(b) provided that if at the end of November the outputhas not reached the agreed figure a reduction willbe made automatically on a scale to be agreed uponnoii and similarly if in any following month the out-put falls below the agreed figure, the wage shall be adjusted for the succeeding month according to thesame arrangement:,Mr. Evan Williams said that against the figure of 2sc should beplaced 248,000,000 tons and against l/6de 244,000,000 tons,IIf the output figure were nearer 248,000,000 than 244,000,000Ithe men would get the 2so    If, for example, it was246,000,000 they would get the 2s,   If it would help the!
Government.to push this through the owners&apos; concession could he outlined to the men. He thought proposals on these linescould be recommended to his people. -flMr. Bonar Law:      &quot;Suppose you have 3d off below 247,000,000tons?Sir A. -Nimmo:      &quot;We do not object to that in principle but itwould involve many wage changes.&quot;Sir A. Nimmo asked what about output above 248,000,000 tons.If the owners were to sacrifice below 248,000,000 tons theyshould get something above 248,000,000 tons but it might benecessary to take a wider step. e.g., 6 million above248,000,000 instead of 4 million below.Mr. Evan Williams:      &quot;I don&apos;t think they would want to widen the step above 248,000,000.      If you keep the margin at 4and you allow the owners to get extra profits you wouldwipe out the pool.&quot;Sir A. Nimmo: pointed out that the men had conceded theprinciple of giving an inducement to the owners.     The bestprinciple would be to stabilise the owners&apos; profits and output.Mr. Evan Williams:      &quot;To do that you must get a stabilisedprice.      I should not object to assuming that the export prices were those for g september.    I doubt if they will be much lower,as for the first few days the bulk of the pool will be going on contract prices.Sir A. Himmo did not see how the money could be got on the november output.     He could see the output  coming alongperhaps in the second half of November.Mr. Bonar Law suggested the addition of words such as&quot;unless some tribunal said the falling off wasnot due to the men.&quot;Mr. Evan Williams:    &quot;The owners&apos; concession would counter that.&quot;The Prime Minister suggested the words&quot;if 248,000,000 tons is reached in the last fortnight of November.&quot;Mr. Evan Williams:    &quot;Assume that the export price will be thesame as for September and assume that all coal in the last two weeks above the average figure for export is for export.&quot;Sir Robert Horne:    &quot;We put it the other way;    &quot;Not more shallbe assumed to be kept for home consumption&quot;.     We must give2j million pounds or there will not be enough to provide the2s.Mr. Evan Williams:      &quot;We cannot hope as owners to get anythingextra on output but we ought to share if there is an increasein values.&quot;The Prime Minister:    &quot;Is there not something to be said for putting the crude proposal as to values first? and having these improvements upon it in reserve?Sir R. Horne:    &quot;We could point out that if prices fell theywould have to face the men. &quot;The Goa&amp; Controller:    &quot;They have been told the price may fallbut not likely within 6 weeks.&quot;Mr. Evan Williams thought they would fall materially in
November.     The men did not know much about the U.S.A.offers of coal to Scandinavia, etc.Sir A. Nimmo said there was lots of coal on the sea cominginto European markets from Japan, China, etc.The Coal Controller thought these shipments were highly-speculative adventures.Mr. Evan Williams though that presently in order to maintain our markets we should have to bring our prices down.The Prime Minister thought the more temporary the solutionthe more the men would be pleased and it would be an inducement to hurry up the permanent arrangementsMr. Bonar Law. &quot;assume there is no big fall in November but abig fall in December?&quot;The Prime Minister:      &quot;I should meet that frankly by the outputalternative and should give the men a guarantee that theyshould get the 2s. irrespective of values.     It would be serious for us if prices dropped and we did not get it made up by an increase in output.     I woutd have a double induce-ment and I could defend it and commend it to the public&quot;At this stage Sir Robert Home and the Coal Controllerretired to draft a proposal on the basis of values on thelines suggested by Mr. Evan Williams, for submission to themeeting with the miners&apos; officials at 12.15*2 Whitehall Gardens, S0W010October 25th,, 1920.
