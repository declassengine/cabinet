Sir Edward Grigg.

-----------------

THE PRIME MINISTER said he was glad of an opportunity to discuss the difficulties in regard to Egypt with Lord Allenby. Difficulties often arose when communications were exchanged entirely in writing. Misunderstandings were very liable to occur as to the exact interpretation to be placed on a phrase in a telegram or a despatch. When the matter was discussed face to face, it would often be found that misunderstandings were removed and agreement reached. It might, of course, be found that there were questions of principle which separated the views of Lord Allenby from those of the Government. It was very important, however to insure that there should be no dispute over some mere misunderstanding. Consequently, he would like Lord Allenby to explain exactly what his position was and he would then explain the position of the Government, and they could try and understand one another&apos;s point of view. The Prime Minister then referred to Lord Allonby&apos;s Despatch of February 2nd, 1922, drawing attention in particular to paragraphs 16 and 17 in which Lord Allenby gave some account of what had occurred at a Cabinet Meeting held on November 4th, 1921. When he read these paragraphs, the Prime Minister said that they conveyed quite a different impression to what


was his recollection of what had occurred at the meeting. Accordingly, he had consulted the Cabinet Minutes, which contained a very full summary of what had occurred, and this entirely confirmed his own recollection. There had no doubt been expressed differences of opinion at this meeting, as at most Conferences or Cabinet meetings, but at the end there had been a definite summing up by the Prime minister himself and the conclusion of the Cabinet had been recorded in plain language. When he read Lord Allenby&apos;s account of the same meeting, he obtained the impression that there had been a great conflict of opinion and no decision.

LORD CURZON entered at this point.

THE PRIME MINISTER repeated, for the benefit of Lord Curzon, what he had already said to Lord Allenby. He then asked Lord Allenby if he could summarise what was the difference between him and the Cabinet.

LORD ALLENBY said that the Cabinet appeared to think that an Egyptian Government might be formed which would be prepared to sign a Treaty which did not give full independence to Egypt. He himself said that this was impossible. His conviction was that any concession or arrangement must be unilateral. No Egyptian Ministry would sign a treaty making a bargain with the British Government for anything less than complete ?. He himself had ? Sarwat Pasha to recommend that the Protectorate over Egypt should be lifted, leaving for subsequent discussion and eventual settlement certain subjects reluting to the British position in Egypt. He had pointed out to H. M. Goverment that this was a most admirable opportunity for achieving a settlement. When this opportunity had not been seized, he had felt that there was no alternative but to resign, as the views he hed were perfectly well known in Egypt. The point at issue, therefore, was that Lord Curzon thought it was possible to make a bargain with an Egyptian Government and he was convinced that it was not. Lord Allenby then pointed out that Sarwat Pasha&apos;s life would not be worth a fortnight&apos;s purchase if he were to enter into a bargain.


The fundamental difference was that Lord Curzon thought a bargain could be made and he knew that it could not. It was essential that the friends of the British Government should not be treated as though they were enemies. If he had been permitted to offer the terms he had proposed, he would have had to deal with a strong and friendly Egyptian Ministry, which was prepared to treat honestly and openly. It was essential to have a friendly Ministry. The sort of Ministry which he had had to deal with during the last three years had been politely hostile or else merely a Ministry of Affairs, and that had been of no value. Lord Allenby at this point referred in detail to some of the Ministries with which he had to deal, culminating in Adly Pasha&apos;s Ministry, which had resigned owing to the failure of the London negotiations. Sarwat Pasha was so hopeful of forming a Ministry and the prospects had been so bright that he had actually intended to include one of Zaghlul&apos;s old supporters. Owing to the long delay by the British Government, however, in taking its decision, the situation had changed. The result was the non-co-operation manifesto whose authors Lord Allonby arrested. He had since seen them and had told them to return to their homes and keep quiet there and had given them warning of the serious danger to which they would be exposed if they did not do so. He had also released the five newspapers which he had found it necessary to suspend. This had been a salutary lesson and he had no fear of a repetition of this incident.


The fact was that all these Egyptian leaders were willing to back the favourite but not if they thought it was going to be pulled. One main cause of many of these difficulties had been that Lord Allenby had not been allowed to hang Abdol-Rahman Fahmy, who had been condemned to death, in the Conspiracy Trial of 1920.

LORD CURZON recalled th? the only reason why Abdol-Rahman Fahmy had not been hanged was that Lord Milner had represented that to carry out this sentence would be to destroy all chance of a settlement.

LORD ALLENBY said that the reasons did not affect the matter, but the fact was that our failure to deal with those people had resulted in a reign of terror. Those who co-operated with us in their own homes were treated as though they were traitors. The Egyptian moderates all feared that Zaghlul Pasha would be allowed to return. At present he was detained at Aden because the British Government were unwilling to charter a ship to take him to the Seychelles. The British Government said that the Egyptian Governement ought to pay, but he could not ask the Egyptian Government to do so.

He himself felt that Great Britain was strong enough to allow Egypt to have independence. If this were done, Great Britain would still retain effective guarantees in its army, its navy and its position in Egypt.

As regards the proposal that Egypt should have its own foreign relations against which so much stress had been laid in the past, (in this connnection Lord Allenby referred to


correspondence of 1914) that had now been concerned and the pro? was thereby virtually abolish?

LORD GURZON asked exactly what Lord Allenby meant by this.

LORD ALLENBY replied that this had been part of Sarwat Pasha&apos;s programme.

LORD CURZON agreed that at one point this had been conceded on condition that Sarwat Pasha took office. Lord Curzon then raised the question as to whether Lord Allenby&apos;s account of what had occurred was quite fair. He recalled that after Lord Allenby&apos;s return to Egypt he had been sent a despatch, dated December 3rd, which informed him of the policy adopted by the British Government. Sarwat Pasha had the put forward a programme on which he was willing to take office. Lord Curzon had accepted it. He had in his possession a telegram in which Lord Allenby expressed his gratification at this acceptance. The British Government had then waited for some time for Sarwat Pasha to take office. Lord Allenby had explained that Sarwat Pasha was apprehensive of Zaghlul. The British Government had then consented that Zaghlul should be removed. After the removal of Zaghlul, Sarwat Pasha had entirely changed his terms. Lord Allenby had telegraphed the new terms to Cannes and Lord Curzon had replied that he would give an answer as soon as he got home. The real reason for the present difficulties, however, was that Sarwat Pasha had been frightened to continue.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that at the moment he would like to avoid these controversial points as regards the past. He himself had never heard Lord Curzon express the view that any Egyptian Ministry would sign any Treaty. First there had been the Report of Lord Milner&apos;s Committee. The Cabinet had rejected this, but had agreed on the abolition of the Protectorate, subject to a suitable Treaty being


concluded with Egypt.     Lord .Gurzon had-undertaken, to do his best to carry out tuis decision.     He had carried on the negotiationswith Adly Pasha which had failed-      Then Lord Allenby had tried to obtain a treaty and had&apos;not succeeded.      The reasonLord Allenbyof this failure was the one /    had given, namely, that SarwatPasha had been afraid.     The Prime Minister then recalled that Sir William Hayter - an English offioial in Egypt, had written a Memorandum in which he stated that no egyptian government would ever be willing to sign a Treaty conflictingwith the policy of the Egyptian Nationalists,     This policyreally amounted to nothing less than complete independence,such as was enjoyed by Roumania.     Anyone who gave away that policy would be regarded&apos; as a traitor and he himself had alwaysthought it would be impossible to obtain a treaty .LORD ALLENBY agreed.THE PRIME MINISTER, continuing, said that if no treaty was possible what was to be done?     He hoped he was wrong in what he believed to be the fundamental difference between lord Allenby and the British Government and if he was wrong,it,he hoped Lord Allenby would say so.     As he understood/theposition was that the British Government did not intend to give up Egypti    that is to say, that special interests in and controlof the British Government over that country.      . e^alt&amp;jst&amp;ndingthe Egyptian attitude and even the attitude of some of the news-papers in this country, they were not willing to give this up.Sarwat Pasha, he gathered, was a Turk and a person in whom theEgyptian public had little confidence.LORD ALLENBY expressed doubts in regard to this.THE PRIME MINISTER, continuing, said that in saying this,he was only repeating   a   view which had been expressed to himby British and Egyptian residents in Egypt.     He was told that Egyptian public opinion had not the same respect forSarwat Pasha as they had for Adly Pasha.     Still, the choice of individuals must rest with the High Commissioner.      The
line of difference between Lord Allenby and the British Government appeared to be that the British Government said that the Protectorate should be abolished, but only on certain specific terms. Lord Allenby said "No. Get rid of the Protectorate and then the effect will be such that opinion in Egypt will be so modified that the Egyptians will conc? your terms." The British Government said. "No; we will not let go until we know exactly where we are in regard to our terms". Lord Allenby said, "Let go now and trust to the effect of your beau geste". If that was the difference, it was fundamental. If the Egyptian Government would accept office on the declaration that they would subsequently agree to the British Government&apos;s terms, that was a different matter.

MR. AMOS at this point asked permission to intervene to say that they were not resting in the hope of creating a good feeling. In fact, they were abandoning the Milner policy, but the proposed letter to the Sultan provided a modus vivendi which would preserve British interests intact.

LORD ALLENBY then referred to the draft letter to the Sultan contained in his telegram No. 19 of January 12th, 1922, and said that it was an attempt to put the policy adumbrated in Lord Curzon&apos;s despatch of December 3rd, in a good light to the Egyptians.

LORD CURZON then referred to paragraphs 10 and 11 of the despatch.

THE PRIME MINISTER, after reading the draft letter, said that it confirmed him in the belief that he had previously stated Lord Allenby&apos;s point of view quite fairly. This letter made it clear that the Britain Government, without waiting for the conclusion of the treaty, would abolish the Protectorate and recognise Egypt as a Sovereign State. They would provide no obstacle to the re-establishment of the Egyptian Ministry of


Foreign Affairs, and would abolish the regime of martial law.He then quoted paragraph 2.3 as follows&quot;As soon as this state of affairs has beenestablished His Mage-sty&apos;s Government will examine in consort (sic) with Egyptian Government and inmost friendly spirit the conclusion of an agreement on following points which will remain for settlement:-.A. Security of communications of hritvshEmpire.B. Defence of Egypt against all foreignaggression or interference., direcorindirect.0. Protection of foreign interests in Egypt.&quot;D-    The Sudan.-MR.AMGS said that- the intention of the draft letter was that these subjects would be reserved.THE B2IMj3 MINISTER asked if there was any point inwhich he had been unfair to lord allenby point of view.Mr.Amos had to deal with Egyptian opinion and he and hiscolleagues had to deal, with Parliament..     ne presumed thatthe procedure would be that the representative of the ForeignOffice in the House, of Commons would have to Introduce aBill which would provide for the ahculition of martial law,tne- withdrawal of tne Protectorate, fc-nd the setting up ofEgypt as a Sovereign State       J--e would be ashed whether therewere any conditions attached to tneso concessions.      the reply would be, &quot;No, we have written a letter to the sultan saying that- certain points&apos;were left over for specificnegotiation,&quot;      His Government would be quite unable totake up such a line in the House of Commons and. aEpolicyof this kind would at ence be rejected.-
On Mr&apos;; Amos indicating dissent from his remarks the Prime Minister asked him to say what he would tell the House of Commons, if he were in thePrime Minister&apos;s place.Mr. Amoe said his case would he that theBritish Government held the goods in their possession.     All the matters which were to hereserved for subsequent discussion with the egyptian government were actually in our hands.     He wouldtell Parliament that these matters were reserved for future. consideration, and that in the meanwhilethey were in eur possession.The Prime Minister said that there oould be nothing worne than to send a letter which the egyptians would understand in one sense and wein another.     The Cabinet had taken a different viewof the meaning of the draft letter from that which mr. Amos appeared to take, and he felt sure that theEgyptian Government would take the same view as thedraft letterCabinet. He asked Mr, Am.03 to shew him one word in the/whioh reserved tho statue, quo..--Mr.6. Amos said that the status goo was asolid fact, namely the military occupation.The Prime Minister pointed out that beforethe war Egypt war not independent.    Its sovereigntyhad been vested in Turkey.      If this draft letterwere sent, this sovereignty would be handed overto Egypt.      That was not maintaining the status quo.If it was intended that the status quo on thesereserved questions was to be maintained,  it wouldbe much better to draw up a document which would say so.      That could easily be done.     Ho did not wish to have any misunderstandings.      If the/Government
Government. mean the same, thing as Lord. Allenby andhis advisors a document could, and should, bedrawn up.-which./would, state it clearly and -withoutambiguity...    Was. he..to understand that L-rd Allenbydid, net intend to let, gc of Egypt?Lord Allenby, said his intention had been,to state that-there were some things which we were   -willing t*-let:-Egypt have beginning, with theWithdrawal cft he Protectorate.   Our guarantee forthe powers we wished to retain were that we hadkept the country for 4-0 years and could centime todo sa for another 4-b years if we so desired.* The\Prime Minister said that if Lord Allenby&apos;draft despatch had been approved and sent, everyfez in Cairo would have been thrown into the air and every Egyptian would have interpreted it . as -meaningthat the British: were to be. cleared out -of.Egypt .and -that they had entire, independence.     His suggestion was that two people, one representing Lord Allenbyand one representing the British.Government, should put down, in plain terms exactly what was intended andtell-;., the Egyptians.. in clear and definite terras howfar we were prepared to go.      If the Egyptians wouldnot. accept, these.-terms then they must:. be told thatthey would have to.  - . -, Lord allenby said that in that case he couldnot gc back tc Egypt.      It was. perfectly wellknown in-Egypt that his policy was as indicatedin the ..draft letter.- -  . The Prime Minister&quot;asked if Lord,;Allenbyconsidered that Mr. Amos had interpreted theletter wrengly.Lord Allenby replied in the negative./The Prime Minister
The Prime Minister suggested that in this caseMr. Amos&apos;   interpretation should he put down inperfectly clear terms.Lord Curzon said that some way might &quot;cafound by which an Egyptian Government taking officemight state clearly and explicitly that theyinterpreted the arrangement in the same way as theBritish Government.Mr. Ames pointed out. that the constructionto he placed on the proposed letter had been clearlyindicated by the designate$Egyptian Ministers, andwas recorded in a Prcces Verbal.    He mad not thoughtit worth while te trouble the Prime Minister Withthis detailoLord Curzon said that    a   Prcces Verbal wasnet  sufficiently authoritative.      His idea was thatthe Ministers on taking office might address aletter to the Sultan containing the interpretation of the Agreement&quot;in similar terms to those used inthe Process Verbal,.Lord All leuby was certain that Ministers would never do this.      They -were not sufficiently sure that they would be backed up by Great Britain.The Prime Minister said that there should beno great difficulty in putting - in writing what Mr\.Amos had said to. him to-day.      He suggested that Mr.01 bAmoe should put/in writing himself.      He believedhe was a very gifted writer.Mr. Amos said that he was not the author ofany of the despatches which had been referred to atthis Meeting./The Prime Minister
The Prime Minister said that if he was, there was nothing to be ashamed of in the despatches which were very fine reading; his only complaint of the despatches was that they did not appear to express the interpretation of the draft letter in the telegram of 12th January, placed on it by Lord Allenby.

Mr. Amos pointed out that the diplomatic situation in Egypt was very different from the political situation in London. The British Government, no doubt, had its own particular difficulties, but in Egypt they were threatened with the great danger of a complete breakdown in the Government. This would be certain to be followed by a period of annexation since there would be nothing else to do. Eventually there would inevitably be a reverse of policy

The Prime Minister asked why.

Mr. Amos said that in ten years time some Government would come in which would be unwilling to continue the difficult situation in Egypt.

The Prime Minister said that of course he could not say what a Socialist Government would do if it came into office, but that apart from this no British Government would be willing to give up British control over Egypt.

Lord Allenby asked if this would be the case for ever. In that event no Egyptian Government would ever accept office.

Mr. Amos said that talk of annexation filled the British officials working in Egypt with despair. The Prime Minister asked whether the policy which Mr. Amos favoured would not result in our losing all control of Egypt.

Mr. Amos


Mr. Amos replied that it would not.    1Tb&apos; mJ.sapprolooriBi.or^,laad^ o       od^^u-4uois^.suh jteot-^tu-^nyone -in Egypt.The Prime Minister said that his information was that both among Egyptians and foreigners thepolicy Mr, Amos favoured was- twaing. ..interpreted as the surrender of &quot;our posit ion thereMr.. Amos asked whether people were saying thatthe presentation1of the draft letter would enable the egyptians to call for the withdrawal of the troops.The Prime Minister said that the view held wasthat it was an abandonment \f the British position inEgypt and trusting to luck..    He culd not go to theHouse of Commons with such a policy..Mr, Amos asked how the-position,  if the policyof the draft letter were adopted-, would differ from theposition in 1914-..Lord Chrzcn pointed out that it would give Egypther independence, which she had never had before.The Prime    Minister expressed similar views and pointed out that Egypt had never had independence forcenturies.Mr.,. AmwS said that the suzerainty of the Turksbefore the war did not affect the position of Egyptvis-a-vis Great Britain.Lard Curzon pointed out that the essential difference was that Egypt would be given independencefor the first time.The Prime Minister asked Mr. Amos if he was willing to put in writing what.he had said verbally.Mr. Amos  said he was here in a very humblecapacity.The Prime Minister pointed out that Mr. Amos-had tnte-Tvened &quot;-^^po^riiaiieou^-ly ir the ,.ac^TOre-ai?rc.n..    Hehad no objection to his ha;vT^3g^k;-hr^id^us-, tut. aa he had
done so he hoped, he  would not object to putting in writing what he had said.

Mr. Amos turned to Lord Allenby.

Lord Allenby said he had no objection to Mr. Amos doing this. His own advice had been very carefully considered and now had been rejected. For three years he had endeavoured to maintain the Protectorate, not without success, and now his advice had been rejected for the second time he must ask the Prime Minister to accept his resignation.

The Prime Minister said he was not sufficiently clear as to the difference existing between them.

Lord Allenby said that the difference was that he insisted on a unilateral declaration and did not believe that any bargain was possible.

The Prime Minister said that all he asked was that the things should be made clear in the letter which Lord Allenby admitted should be made clear. If Mr. Amos, in consultation with Lord Allenby, would put in writing the views he had expressed, another meeting might be held the same afternoon further to consider the matter.

The Conference then adjourned until 6 p.m. on the dame date.
