TEE PRIME MINISTER informed the Conference that hewas to meet       Cleuenee.au on the following day, and he wishedto consult hi a colleagues as to the line that he should take.He himself thought it might be best if -he -.v\et K. Clemenceaualone, in order that they might clear the air by a franktalk before any Conference was held with other AlliedMinisters.    It would probably be necessary to invite SignorScialoto some of the meetings,  and his own opinion wasthat it mi^ht be as well to send an invitation to the Aineri-oan Ambassador.    Unfortunately, the conversations which hadhithe &apos;to taken place with Signor Scialoia had proved absolute-ly fruitless, as the Italian Foreign Minister neither had any suggestions to make himself, nor had he any authority toaccept any suggestions of ours.. - Mr Lloyd George said thathe attached the greatest importance to a very early meeting,in Italy,  England,  cr elsewhere, of really responsible Minis-ters with authority to sign Agreements.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS agreedthat an invitation should be- sent to Mr Davis to be present at meetings when Signer Scialoja attended, but he was quite certain that Mr Davis would be party to no decision.    Hethought that a number of talks with M.  Olemenoeau might bemore profitable than one prolonged Conference.It was agreed  That invitations should be sent to theAmerican Ambassador and Signor Scialojato attend certain Conferences to be heldin the course of the next few days, whenthe questions of the Adriatic and Turkeyw?&quot;e discussed.THE PRIME MINISTER then asked what he should say -to U,.Clemenceau.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS suggestedthat he should speak rather on the lines on- which he had spoken to M. Loucheur when the latter had lunched with himrecently, when the Prime minister- had pointed out how things were drifting and how the United States were practicallydropped out.    He had further complained of the tone of the
French Press, which was inspired by the Quai 4* Or say andwhich..was to be deplored at a time when things were socritical.    Ho&apos;^ was. it possible to rcake Peace in the liiddleEast when the atmosphere was poisoned by Allied Pressattacks?    The&quot; second point was that thin?.3 were drawing toa he;.-d in Morocco.    The French thought that they had Syriain their hands, that they had squared Feisul, and they howintended to turn Tangier into a French Naval PossessionsA third point to which the Prime Minister night refer&quot; wasthe question of the guarantee of the integrity of Frenchsoil.    ThiS was oti- pt^on^est weapon, arid should be kept in reserve.    Parliament had accepted the ,guarantee so long asthe United States were associated with us, but if - we. came in alone it was doubtful whether it ^would  be approved.    he hoped that the two Priise Ministers would not .get tangled up with the narrower issues involved, i,eM the borders ofPalestine, the Dan-Beeraheba line,  or the limits of Arabsphere.   As regards Constantinople, was it to remain withthe Turk,  and, if not, what kind of administration was to bset up?    The French had recently changed their attitude;    a first they had wanted to take over the administration ofConstantinople.    They had then receded from this position,and th?n, after the withdrawal of the United States, theyhad revived the proposal for an Ancrlo-French administrationwith an Anglo-French Police Force, and so on, leading to a condominium, which would be a certain source of friction,in his opinion, out of which we should eventually clear wit.disgust.    Lord Gurscn said that he &apos;--as in favour of anInternational Commission administering Constantinople andthe Straits.    If it were necessary to .make concessions toMoslem and Indian sentiment, he would fc.ransfe? the  capital of Turkey to Asia Minor and.leave the Sultan in a &quot;Vatican&quot;on the Straits.    Two further proposals had been made;    one was to have definite spheres of economic control for theFrench, the Italians and the Greeks;    and the second,, to
have one Power to ?, the ? another the Customs, and so forth.

THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that his own plan was --

(a) The Greeks to have Smyrna, and

(b) The Italians to be granted prior economics concessions in the area allotted to them under the Sykes-Picot  Agreement.

He did not think it was necessary to work out the details of this at present. What we ourselves really Wanted was free ingress for our goods. He reminded the Conference that what we had obtained in Mesopotamia was enormous, whereas the Italians were in reality receiving very little. He suggested that we should follow roughly the lines of the Agreement of 1916, which save Mesopotamia to the British, Syria and Gilicia to the French, and South Asia Minor to the Italians. His own view was that the Italians would accept much less than they  were entitled to claim.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA thought that much depended upon the way in which the negotiations were conducted. He suggested that, in granting concessions to the Italians, care should be taken to avoid any appearance of partitioning up Asia Minor among the Allies. If it was intended to turn Turkey out of Constantinople, he did not think the so-called "Vatican" solution was any real solution so far as Moslem  sentiment was concerned. The Moslems did claim the sovereignty, however titular and shadowy, of Constantinople. He agreed that an International Commission was the right solution, but he would have a Treaty with the Turks forcing the Sultan to have Constantinople and the Straits administa?ed by a Commission in the Sultan&apos;s na?e.   He was anxious to kno? what it was proposed to do with Adrianople. The further one went North of the Straits the more Turkish the population became. Briefly, he agreed entirely with Mr Balfour about Italy, and he did not quarrel with the suggestion that the Greeks should be given Smyrna,  and he agreed


with the ^reign secretary&amp;tary atopul an international agntwsl        ^of the Straits so long as the titular sovereignty of Ooh-stantihople regained with the Turks.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR said that he earnestlytrusted that the conversations with M. Cleraencean would beprofitable.   Any solution was better than no solution.    Hethought that the prime Minister should say that,  as theUnited States have now gone out* the matter-is simplified;and if only Prance and England can reach agreement on Turkishpolicy, with a fair recognition of Italian claims, we could make that agreement effective. - Prance would be consternatedif she learned that it was by no means a foregone conclusionthat we would guarantee her integrity, and he agreed with lord Curzon that this was a very powerful weapon in our hands.Today the Turkish control was passing from cur hands,    Wecontrolled Constantinople on both sides of the Straits, butnot the huge territories lying outside it.    There was a real danger of Bolshevist penetration, imperilling our interestsin the Middle &quot;;ast.    Another reason why it was important tocome to an early agreement with the French was that our troops in Turkey were deteriorating in quality and they hadto be relieved by young,  immature men.    The French had greatinterests in Constantinople, and so we ought to be able tosquare them.    It was vital to come to some definite agreementbetween the two Great Powers concerned.    He was in favour ofwhat would virtually be an Anglo-French Administration,-withcertain concessions to other Powers.    Next,.-he had reason tobelieve that M. Clemenceau intended to discuss Russia.    Thesituation there deteriorated every day.    If nothing could bedone we ought to clear out.    He reminded the Conference thata month previously the Prime Minister had practically given  an assurance to the House of Commons that the Russian question would be finally settled at this Conference.   As with Turkey,so with Russia;    there must be a joint definite Anglo-Frenchoolicy.    rTe must decide  
(a) &apos;.that grders were to be given to. theBaltic States:(b) EJhat we were to do in regard to poland:(o) Are we to adopt theS&amp;Uinkoff policyof a Conference between the anti-Bolshevik States and the loyal Rus-siana,with Great . Britain and Prancesup;j.r vising?If there were, ranch further delay, Lenin and Tro+sky wouldprevail,,    England and Prance must speak with one voice, inrespect of Finland,-.- the Baltic States,., the loyal Russians,and so on.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD *F EDUCATION said that hewas much attracted by iir Balfour&apos;s suggestion for South asia minor, but as regards North Asia Minor and Armenia we hada strong oody of opinion in England which was anti-Tur&apos;.^.which we tnifht- attract by showing f-at ^e had taken properprecautions to ensure the protection of Armenia.    As regardsConstantinople and the Straits, he favoured an international commission to control the Straits and to exercise effective control over Constantinople, with the Sultan in nominalcontrol.    Indian students with whom he had cose in contactwe&quot;e vary -aon-ehensive of the effect in India of the expul-s ion of Tu&quot;key f rom Constant inople.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS thoughtthat if the French re.rained in Asia Minor we might argue that it was up to then; to look after the whole of the armenians on the coast and in the strip connecting with russian Armenia, near Erivan.   An alternative had beensuggested by Lord Bryce, who had said that if we could persuade some great or small Power to take charge ofArmenia the United States would supply the necessary funds,although they might shrink fro..&apos;., political responsibility.As regards Mr Fisher&apos;s other point, he did not believethat there was any serious or lasting sentiment in Englandabout expulsion.
THE LORD PRESIDENT OP THE COUNCIL said that mr churchill&apos;s view was that the Prime Minister should come tosome agreement with&apos;.... Clenenceau, and then    , say to therest of the world that we could not tolerate anarchy in theMiddle East, that Prance and Great Britain were in agreement,and that the other Powers jnust conform,  - This would involvethe exclusion of the Italians, who might be a great nuisance,but it wag not Vise to icno**e them.    Owing to their great increase of population as compared with Prance, they imaginedthemselves to be a Great Power,    Moreover, they felt ill-usedover the Treaty of London, and there was no doubt that theFrench had behaved badly towards then?.    7e could not,  inhis opinion, settle Asia Minor without reference to Italy,and it would be impolitic to thrust her ostentatiously intothe background.   He agreed that there could be no Inter-allied conference in London during the next two or three days.    &quot;hatwas required was a Conference of much bigger scope than waspossible here, with more extended time.    l7e xainht tell theFrench that they had made Paris impossible, that we do not insist unon London, and that we suggest that the conference should meet at Brussels.   Ae regards Constantinople he was inclined to agree with Lord Curzon.   The place was no partof Moslem religion, but only of Moslem sentiment.    In any agreement he hoped it might be possible to exhibit Italy,at any -ate nominally, on equal terms with France;   herintrigues would no doubt continue, but they would not be effective.     Some Agreement which could be reached with IUClemenceau was devoutly to be desired.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said he ag *eed with Mr Balfouras regards the Italians.   We ought first to come to someclear agreement with M. Clemenceau, and then bring in theItalians.    In regard to Constantinople, both the Aga Ehanand Lord Sinha in Pa-Is hid attached great importance to
Moslem sentiment.    - There was no object, he thought, intaking it from the Turks and handing it ove- entirely/ to international control.    We&apos; could get all we wanted by anInternational Co..mission working through a titular Sovereignin Constantinople.Tfip. PRIME MINISTER thought that about 30,000 inter-national troops would be required to occupy the Straits.    Itwas undesirable that the Sultan should have anything morethan a handful of guards himself.    Were we to make the Sultanlike the Khedive,  or was he to be independent, like the Shahof. Persia?    The latter alternative he thought was dangerous.Although,  as Mr Montagu had said, the population northwards-towards Adrianople was mainly Turkish, the people outsideConstantinople proper were overwhelmingly Greek.    He thoughtthat we should treat the Sultan as another Khedive, and keephim in Constantinople.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS thoughtthat if the Sultan was left- in Constantinople the Moslemworld would say that we had never really defeated him, andhe would become at once -the centre of reaction and futuretrouble.    We thought we should try and settle the future ofConstantinople, not from the point of view of india but ofthe future, of the world.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL did not agree, but thought -thatwe should look at the question mainly from the point of viewof the futu-e of, and how it affected;; the British Empire.If we could satisfy the Turks that we intended to treat themwell, it would benefit us in India, Mesopotamia and Egypt.THE PRIME MINISTER thought, that they should considerthe practical result of the policies suggested.    If the sultan was at Constantinople,  his Ministers must be there.He would then govern Turkey from Constantinople, whe-e wecoulrt. onlv allow him a small bodyguard.    This would mean that he would be the creature of what was really a foreignjunta.    There was the danger that the French would always
try to Influence hies, and we should, have a revival of the oldG^eek &quot;pmi*e in a nuch wo-se form.. Constantinople wouldbecome a source of infection and war.    In his view the Turkought to have a chance of making a Turkish Kingdom or commu-nity.    This he could not do if he remained under an Inter-national Commission, the effect of which would be to turnTurkey into an Egypt worse than the Egypt of * he old days,as the Italians an well as the French would be concerned withits administration.    He admitted the peril of Moslem and&apos;Indian sentiment, but he would say to the Turk:- &quot;Go toBvusa, where you can be independent.    As Turkey must govern the Straits they . ust be guarded by an international force.The closing of the Straits by Turkey during the ;?ar had pro-longed * he &quot;&apos;ar by two years, and Turkey had thus signallyfailed in her duty to the wo-Id&quot;,    The Turk was in a minority in Constantinople itself, and much more so in the suburbs.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOE INDIA asked whether thePrime Minister would consider a plebiscite of the populationof Thrace, on the lines of the Polish plebiscite.Tgr ppjr-IE MINISTER pointed out that the cases were rather different.    Danzig was 95 per/cent. German, -but as itwas the door of Poland we could not leave it to Germany.Constantinople was the door between Europe and Asia, and mustbe internationalised.    Further, with her great populations,Turkey was a different problem from Egypt, where the pooula-tion ?ras o-actically entirely on the banks of the Nile.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOE INDIA said he wished itplaced on record that all Indian opinion in London and India,official and native, was against the.proposed solution.    Itwould be quite impossible to use Indian troops to enforce a peace of this kind,THE LORD PRIVY SEAL again emphasized the importanceof conciliating Turkish opinion.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR &quot;JAR said the Conference had formed certain quite clear proposals:-
&apos; * 38i(a)  That Constantinople should be inter-nationalised:(1/ (b) That the Sultan should reside there asa titular head:(c) That the government of Turkey should beexercised from Brusa, where the Sultan&apos;ministers would be, with Allied Commis-sioners to advise them.THE PRIME MINISTER said that in this way the YildizKiosk would be the Sultan&apos;s Vatican.    He reminded the Con-ferenoe that today there was a Commission governing Constanti-r-nople in the Sultan&apos;s name.THE PRESIDENT CP THE BOARD OP EDUCATION said he agreed with Mr Churchill&apos;s suggestion as tending to conciliate Turk-ish and Moslem sentiment,.    It would be a great advantage tous if we could make the Turks feel that we had played upfor them.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL asked which solution was likely togive less trouble to us in Egypt,  India and Mesopotamia?THE SECRETAHt? OP STATE FOR INDIA said he would with-draw his objection if the government was to be from Brusain the name of the Sultan, who would have power to reside in constantinople.    He again enquired what was to be done aboutAdrianople.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS repliedthat early in the year it had been proposed in Paris thatthere should be an international State there.    In. regard toMr Montagu&apos;s statement about the unanimity of Indian opinion,he said that all the Indian officials in the Middle Eastwere strongly in favour of the dissolution of the turkish empire and of turning the Turks out of Constantinople.THE SECR TARY OF STATE FOR WAR foresaw danger inlettimr the Sultan be in Brusa, where he would graduallycollect round him Mustapha Kemal, Ehver, Trotsky and others,who would help him build up a huge hostile force, and turnAsia Minor and Arabia into a Seething cauldron of trouble.

It would be wise, in bis opinion,  to keep him in Constanti-nople, under our eye.    However, he was quite prepared tosupport anything that was agreed upon by the Prime Ministerand Um Clemenceau,THE LORD PRIVY SEAL thought that  the Prime minister might put it to M. Clemenceau:     &quot;What is most likely to bringpeace in the British Empire and peace in Europe?&quot;.rpw-c! pnTyag MINISTER said the point was that the Alliancethat won the War was now falling to pieces.    The United .states were dropping away,  Italy was recalcitrant, and France and ourselves were agreed on no subject.    France wanted to adoptBismarck&apos;s attitude, which nearly brought on war in 1874-..It was essential for us to have a complete understanding with france on all these vital problems.    It&apos;was disastrous thatthe Peace Conference had been held in Paris, where a press campaing against us had been sedulously worked by the Quaid&apos;Orsay,  and even M. Clemenoeau had been overborne.    Moreover,Signor Orlando&apos;s constant absence.,with his Foreign Minister,meant that popular opinion in Italy, had gone to pieces.    Hewould like +0 revert, to the practice adopted by the SupremeWa- Council, which was.,, that the Allied Ministers met intheir several countries in turn.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS thoughtthat M. Clemenceau&apos;s point was that he must keep up the prestige of France by having the Conferences in Paris,especially because&apos; the British were everywhere en evidence in the Middle East;    but he agreed with the Prime minister that Paris as the meeting place had really smashed the alliance.    He himself would like to have the Conferencesomewhere where could be. assembled all the Ministers who could decide fundamentals.    The fundamentals to be decidedW a -n   .(i) Cur general policy in Russia:(ii) Asia Minor and the question of Mandates:(iii)  Is the Turk to be in or outside Constan-tinople?
As regards the Conference to settle these questions,  he would the SECRETARY CP STATE FOR TAR agreed v-ith this latter supcreation, on the understanding that the finalratification should take place in Paris.sible to get really responsible Italian Ministers to come toLondon.
