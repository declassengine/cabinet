Pie asked ifit was not possible to have some scheme in which, in the eventPRESENT:-FOR THE GOVERNMENT.FOR THE GOAL OWNERS.The Prime Minister.Sir Adam Nimmo.Mr Bonar Law.Mr Evan Williams.
of the desired output not being realised,: the owners also would suffer some diminution in their profits.    This wouldbe a guarantee by the owners to the men of their bona fideintention to obtain more profit.    Would it, perhaps, Tiepossible for the owners to say that they would agree to a diminution of some part of their 10 per cent.?    Prom calcu-lations which had been made, he understood that the loss tothe owners would be more nominal than real, when account wastaken of Income Tax, Super Tax, and all the deductions whichwere already made.SIR ADAM NIMMO and Mr EVAN WILLIAMS explained that theyreally had no powers to commit the owners to anything of thekind, and they could not take the responsibility of giving adefinite reply.    They felt sure, however, that the owners would point out that while the miners were getting advantagesout of the bargain and were only asked in the event of failure to realise output to give up the whole or part of those ad-vantages, the owners were getting absolutely nothing.    Ofcourse if they were getting something out of it they wouldnot mind giving up a part if output was not realised.    Itwould take about 48 hours for them to summon the representa-tiv^s of the mine owners.    Both the mine owners presentexpressed a strong preference for a scheme based on outputover a scheme based on profits.    They thought it was unlikelythat the miners would accept a profits scheme when theyreally understood it.    If it came to this point, that theMiners&apos; Federation would accept the output scheme if theowners would give guarantees, they thought that would be themoment to approach the owners.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that Mr Smillie was neverlikely quite to reach that point.    If, however, the Govern-,ment were in a position to s&amp;y that they were going to ask-2-
the owners to give up something, this would help Mr Smilliein &quot;facing the miners,, who did not like the output scheme.He would not, however, like to tell Mr Smillie that he was willing to put this question to the owners unless he felttolerably certain that the owners would accept.THE MINE OWNERS then indicated that if the Prime minister was of opinion that on this basis the proposal would be ac-cepted by the miners,  they thought with the Prime Ministershelp the mine owners might be induced to make the concession.It would probably be necessary for the Prime Minister himself to see the mine owners.    Up to the present time the owners had got very little out of the pool, and many of them werenot in the mood to make concessions.SIR ROBERT HORNE pointed out that it would help very muchin establishing good feeling between the miners and the mineowners if the latter could make the proposal on their own initiative.SIR ADAM NIMMO said that he understood that this proposal was only made in connection with the output proposal, and notwith the scheme based on profits?THE PRIME MINISTER agreed that this was the case.The Conversation then turned to the question of a proposal that while 248,000,000 tons should be the datum of productionaimed at, the 2/- should not be taken off until it fell to244,000,000 tons.THE MINE OWNERS pointed out that the Government would bein a great difficulty in explaining to the public that this did not mean a reduction of the datum from 248,000,000 to244,000,000 tons.    SIR ADAM NIMMO thought that the mine owners would probably be opposed to the Government on that.Mr BONAR LAW observed that this was vital.    The Governmentcould face the public and make their case to them for this-5-
arrangement, but they could not do so if the mine ownerspublicly supported the view that it was equivalent to reducing the datum line to 244,000,000 tons.The discussion then passed to the possibility of conclud-ing an arrangement with the miners on the basis of profitsinstead of on the basis of output.THE PRIME MINISTER explained that it had been made very clear,  in the course of the discussion, that the miners didnot like to return to a basis of output, since that had been so signally rejected by the ballot of the miners.    They had shown themselves much more willing to examine a scheme basedon profits.    He was anxious that the mine owners shotildconsider this point and let him have their views on thefollowing morning.There was then a considerable discussion on the questionof the scale of reductions below the datum line, and various alternative proposals were made.Finally, it was arranged that the mine owners should thinkthese matters over, and return on the following morning at10-45 to give their views to. the Prime Minister and hiscolleagues.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,October 24, 1920.
