British, war, to :ie paid&apos;,    (3) if reparation was tobe paid to the Oh-istiana who had been forcibly expelled bythe Turks duwin&quot; the &apos;*ar, and to British subjects whose property had been destroyed;    (4) if the Pores were to haveeffective means of protecting the Christian minorities inTurkey from massacre and oppression,    Li. Venicelog estimatednon-Turkish minorities to number about 3,000,000.    Led Curzntheneforp, * bought that -while there was no advantage in try into wrin? blood from atone, you could not f *eat Turkey
differently from the other enemy countries. He therefore proposed a strict from of financial control, subject to the provision that this would be relaxed as soon as the Turkish obligations had been paid off. Lord Curzon finally stated that he thought the Turks would really welcome stringent financial control for a number of years as the only method of putting their country upon its legs.

Mr Montagu objected to the extent of financial control proposed, and saw great advance in concentrating all powers of control - military, financial and political - in the hands of a single Commission, instead of dividing them.



CHATALJA



(2) The discussion then turned upon the question of the frontier in Europe.

The Prime Minister expressed himself as being strongly in favour of the Chatalja line because it would be an advantage that part of the duty of patrolling the frontiers of the Sea La? should be undertaken by the Greeks and not by the Allies.

Mr Montagu pressed the General Staff objection that this would impede the line of communication between the Allied Forces occupying Gallipoli and the Bosphorus.

It was generally agreed, however, that the objections to the Chatalja line were not substantial, and that this was the best frontier to propose in the North.



SMYRNA.

(3) There was some discussion of the Smyrna question.

The Prime Minister stated that ?. Venizelos had made it clear to him that he would not be able to remain Prime Minister of Greece if the Conference required the Creeks to leave Smyrna. This, however, did not exclude the possibility of Smyrna being left under Turkish nominal suzerainty while the Greeks had the political power within the limits of their occupation.




The Conference thought that some such arrangement might be considered.

CILICIA

(4) Lord Curzon pointed out that the French in their proposals apparently contemplated annexing Cilicia without even a pretence at a mandate.

It was agreed that it was out of the question to agree to this.



ADMINSTRATIVE CONTROL TURKEY.

(5) There was some discussion of Lord Curzon&apos;s proposals for the control of Gendarmerie, Police, Justice and Public Works.

It was agreed that, in the discussions with the French an attempt should be made to see whether 1. would be possible to frame a loosen form of administrative supervision.

FINANCE.

(6) The discussion then returned to Finance.

The Prime Minister thought that the best plan would be to give complete control of all the revenues of the Straits to the Commission of Control, that the first charge on Turkish revenues should be the cost of the forces of occupation in the Straits (it was roughly estimated that this would cost between 3 and 6 millions), that the second charge should be compensation to refugees, and the third charge pre-war debt.

It was decided that -

Lord Curzon should have a meeting with Mr Montagu the following morning and prepare a Memorandum, as the outcome of this discussion, containing proposals in regard to the Straite and the control of Turkey, on the assumpton that the Turks were to be left in Constantinople, for submission to M. Clemenceau.
