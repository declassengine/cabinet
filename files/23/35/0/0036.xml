(l)  These Conversations were held in order to discuss the Forth- position to be taken up at the outset of the forthcomingIffiing Con-Es at ions Conversations due to., commence on the following day with1th theinn Fein Mr de Valera and the other Sinn Fein leaders.Mr Cope, the Assistant Under-Secretary in the IrishGovernment, first gave those present all the informationhe had been able to gather in regard to the personnel ofthe Sinn Fein Delegation and the attitude they were likely
to adopt. After this. he withdraw, and the discussion contin-ued.General Smuts, who had seen Mr de Valera and some of hiscolleagues the same morning, then gave his impressions.The first question discussed was as to whether the Prime   *&apos;Minister should see Mr de Valera alone, or whether,  inconjunction with some of his &quot;colleagues in the Cabinet, heshould hold a formal Conference with the Sinn Fein&apos;leaders.In this connection the Prime Minister read the followingletter which he had just received from Nix- de Valera:-&quot;Tbe hour you suggest will suit me admirably.T am not sure whether it is your intention&apos;that we should be alone or with colleagues.Would you kindly let me know definitely?For my own part i am quite ready, if youprefer, to meet you alone,&quot;It was generally agreed that this letter indicated a desireon Mr de Valera&apos;s part to see the Prime Minister alone.General Smuts said that he had advised Mr de Valera andhis colleagues that this would be the best plan.    The fact was that these young men, who had talked so big about an irish Republic and made a rebellion, were totally inexperiencedand were in a state of extreme nervousness about negotiating with so distinguished a statesman as Mr Lloyd George.    Thefirst object was to. remove these not unnatural apprehensionsand to establish a good atmosphere in which to carry out the-a___    . -i     ____j*_________ T.T- ma al -P   ^e1 *&quot;    4-Vint-    tl-ia fioat.   vtia.ivmore lomiaj. uoruereauBa.     xun ixj.ua wax   aoj-u   uumu ^Vw-    jof achieving this would be for Mir Lloyd George to see Mr de valera with the least possible formality and to discuss thematter very frankly-    It would be desirable for the PrimeMinister to allow Mr de Valera to talk very freely;    in fact,to give him plenty of tether.After considerable discussion, the line suggested byGeneral Smuts was agreed to, and under the Prime Minister^instructions Sir Edward Grigg telephoned a letter for Mr de valera, proposing that the first interview should be between
i   * the ^ime Minister and Mr de Valera alone.The subsequent course of events was left until after thePrime Ministers interview had indicated what would he thebest way of continuing  the discussions.\ Fiscal (2) A good deal of discussion took place hsfcx in regardjstron. &amp;to the fiscal question, and it was generally agreed that,if and when the Conference came to business,  the real diffi-culty would arise in this respect.    The Sinn Fein leaders were likely to demand fiscal autonomy for the whole ofIreland.    It was almost certain, however, that Ulster wouldnot agree to this,  as the population of Southern ireland would be in so large a majority that their view as to the fiscal methods to be applied would almost certainly prevail.To meet this, a proposal had been made that no fiscalmeasure could be applied without the consent of the NorthernIreland Representatives on the Council.    This would mean that Southern Ireland would have a majority but NorthernIreland would, have the veto, which it was recognised woulda systemnot be/very easy /to work.   Another plan would be to allowSouthern Ireland, to have fiscal autonomy subject to free trade with Great Britain and Northern Ireland, while NorthernIreland itself would be allowed to opt between the possessionof fiscal autonomy and a single fiscal system with GreatBritain.    Should Northern Ireland opt for fiscal autonomy,the question was raised as to whether there would then be anyjustification for Ulster to retain its members in the british parliament, a power which it was understood NorthernIreland was very anxious to keep.It was pointed out that if fiscal autonomy were given to southern Ireland and taxation was thereby veiy much reduced in Southern Ireland, it would be an almost irresistibletemptation to Northern Ireland to throw in its lot with southern Ireland.    From the point of view of Great Britain
it was most undesirable that taxation in Southern ireland should be materially less than in Northern Ireland er inGreat Britain itself.    It was also urged as essential that ireland should take its share of the National Debt.
(3) A short discussion then took place in regard to the .present situation in Gaaa&amp;se,  in connection with which an appreciation by the General Staff was referred to  (paper cp.-5124).The attitude which the British Government had adoptedin refusing to allow Greece even to purchase war material in this country was discussed.    It was recalled&apos; that, owingto the assistance which had been given to Turkey by Italyand Prance, an arrangement had been entered into at- therecent London Conference that Great Britain, Prance and italy should all remain absolutely neutral and should not furnishsupplies to either party.    A suggestion was made, however,that to refuse even to allow the Greeks&apos; to purchase warmaterial was an extreme interpretation of neutrality, andthat the vast majority of the precedents were in favour of allowing both parties to purchase.    It was then recalled thatwe had felt it Impossible to allow the Turks to purchase warmaterial in this country since we were technically still at war with them, and that, in order to secure strict neutrality,it had been regarded as necessary also to prohibit the Greeksfrom purchasing.The trend of the discussion was in favour of allowing the Greeks to purchase war material, more particularly inview of the fact that the murks are now evidently in collusionwith the Bolsheviks and receiving arms and munitions of war from russia, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,July 15, 1921.
