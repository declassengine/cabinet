THE EMPLOYMENT OF JUDGES TO PRESIDE OVER INDUSTRIAL COURTS.

(2) The Conference considered a request from the Minister of Labour what Lord Shaw of Dumfermline should be appointed to preside over a court of inquiry, which he had been asked by the Transport Workers&apos; Union and Lord Devonport to set up to inquire into the transport workers&apos; demand for a wage of 16s. a day. In support of this request it was pointed out that Judges possessed in a unique degree the confidence of the workers as Presidents of these courts.

It was agreed:-

That Lord Shaw of Dunfermline should be appointed President of the Inquiry into the wages of Transport Workers, but, in view of the congestion in the work of the Law Courts, as explained to the Conference by the Lord Chancellor, and the frequent demands made on the Judicial Bench in cases of this kind, the Prime Minister, without committing himself to any particular number undertook to give favourable consideration to the Lord Chancellor&apos;s request for an increase in the number of Judges.

(The Conference adjourned at midnight).
