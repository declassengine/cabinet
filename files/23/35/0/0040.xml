carry them. We had made a settlement of the Eastern Question a condition of our Treaty of Guarantee to France and this settlement was the host that we could hope to have. We had done our utmost to help Greece by making the Treaty of Guarantee conditional on a settlement of the Eastern Question and there was nothing better in sight for Greece, unless she were prepared to continue the war to a successful decision.

M. GOUNARIS explained that while the Greek Army was able to hold its positions he could not reach a decision without foreign help.

THE PRIME MINISTER said ho quite understood that and did not regard it as reflecting in any way on the Greek Army. Their achievements had been very wonderful and it was too much to expect of them to renew the offensive now. M. Gounaris should also realise that public opinion in England and France had been very much alienated by the return of King Constantine who had acted against the Allies in the war, and that there would be little support for the Greeks in going on. King Constantine was out chief obstacle in securing popular support for Greece. Fooling had been chilled by his return. He was not saying this, of course, with any suggestion that we concerned ourselves in the internal affairs of Greece, but he thought it necessary to make it clear that British feeling about Greece, which fundamentally unchanged, had temporarily lost some of its warmth.

M. GOUNARIS said that he greatly regretted the series of events which had led up to this and was convinced that the British view did not correspond with the facts. He would not, however, enter into that question now. He flattered himself taht the British Government had had good evidence that the Greek attitude showed full appreciation of the continuity of interest between Great Britain and Greece.


TEE PRIME MINISTER said ,there was an old-standingsentiment in England for Greece whiot had not changed at albut there was also a certain antagonism to thd existingGreek Ministry and this was very unfortunate at a moment when English sentiment was so vital to Greece.      It ,vsasquite certain that our proposals were now the utmost that could be secured for Greece.     She would have evory reasonto be gratified with such a settlement as it would addgreatly to her power and prestige.     Ho beggedM.. Gduaaria to put himself entirely in Lord Curzon&apos;shands.Me GOUBARIS indicated that he would do so.THE  RIME MINISTER added that If and When this settlement was carried through Greeoce would be inpossession of very considerable new territories-     she had /rapidly increasing population and great possibilitiesof - development.   . He was disappointed that events had made it impossible for Greece to be established in Smyrna asprotector of the Christian populations.      The future,however^ was with Greece-.CAHNES*12th January,19 22.
