(Introduced by Mr. A. B. Vaux India Office). 

Mr. Hasan Imam.

Mr. Chotani.

Dr. Ansari.

Shaikh Kidwal.

Mr. A. Ghaffar.

Mr. Hasan Imam. We have first of all to thank you for according to us another opportunity of making our submissions. We know that time has very much pressed in the conduct of the high duties you have to perform. I shall try not to take much of your time. The memorandum that we have submitted must already have reached you.

PRIME MINISTER. I have read that.

MR. HASAN IMAM. And I am sure you will not require me to read it out.

PRIME MINISTER. No, I have read that very carefully.

MR. HASAN IMAM. We discussed in some details the important questions of principle in our first interview. There are five points on which we wish now to invite you particular attention, and I shall state them first and then make our submissions afterwards.

 






- a -On behalf of the ^oharmaedaas of India, we have cometo raske the. prayer that Constantinople maj? be evacuated and left free to the people of Constantinople,. namely, the Juries,fhe suffering there tu var.; great on account of the largeinflux of people.    Our information is that we have as ?aanyas two million people in this city of Constantinople whilethe capacity of that town is not more than eight hundred thousand,   iRe have received authentic and reliable letters from there, and the suffering seems to be very great,   Thatis one point,She second point is in regard to Thrace,   3?he first andthe most important point that we consider in regard to Thraceis that that part of the country should not be given to theCreeks on any account.    It would wake us harpy if Thrace couldbe given to the Turks, but if that cannot be - done - we arenot in a position to say what can be done and What cannot bedone - b t if that cannot be done for any reason, thou we ask that a new State may be created in the nature of &amp; neutralstate with &amp; Moslem ruler, and that Western and  astern Thracemay be combined and constituted into one autonomous state.    in western Thrace the Mohammedan population is outstandinglylarge.    In Eastern ffhr&amp;oe the Mohammedan population is predo-minantiy Turkish, and the population is predominantly Turkish-generally.. l!he third item on whioh we ui&amp;h to make our submission to you Is isroyrns, for the economic prosperity of Asia Minorwe feel that  Smyrna is an absolute..; necessity to- Turkey-The fourth point is in regard to the Arab States,   Wehave mentioned that as a separate head in the memorandum thatm have submitted to you.   The Arab statue, namely, Syria,Palestine,-Mesopotamia, the Hejaa, fee ask that these arab states
 States may be constituted as independent States and freed from outside control.

The fifth point is that the Ehalif&apos;s suzerainty may be recognised over all those portions of the territories that recently constituted the Ottoman Empire.

PRIME MINISTER. Suzerainty over the Arab States as well?

MR. HASAN IMAM. I mean religious suzerainty.

PRIME MINISTER. I see.

MR. HASAN IMAM. That is, his position as the Khalif.

PRIME MINISTER. Have we anything to do with this? Is it not a matter for the Moslems? themselves to choose their own religious Chief? That is a thing surely that we cannot dictate about. We feel that we should not interfere with the Khalifate, because that is a matter for the great spiritual and religious body to which you belong to choose for itself. England has never interfered in these matters. We could no sooner interfere with the choice of the Khalif than we would with the choice of a Pope for our Catholic fellow subjects. That is a religious thing altogether.

MR. HASAN IMAM. What has caused us a certain amount of anxiety is Article 139 of the Treaty.

PRIME MINISTER. You mean the words jurisdiction of any kind over the Moslems?

MR. HASAN IMAM. That is the point.

PRIME MINISTER. Is not the spiritual sovereignty of the Khalif of the same kind as the spiritual sovereignty of the Pope over the Catholics?

MR. HASAN IMAM. It is something different from that.

PRIME MINISTER. In what respect? Would you mind telling me?

MR, HASAN IMAN.


MR. HASAN IMAM. I shall tell you. Now, for certain purposes it is very similar - I will not say it is exactly the same - but similar. There are circumstances when the fiat of the khalif may be required for the whole of the Moslem world. The words used in Article 139 are so comprehensive that they might be read to oust the religious jurisdiction and authority of the Khalifa, or Shaikh ul Islam or any authority appointed by the Shaikh ul Islam. It is not enough to say what meaning was in the mind of the draughtsman. The whole clause is repugent to us, and according to your interpretation it is unnecessary. I am not very familiar with the authority of the Pope.

PRIME MINISTER. The authority of the Pope is very complete in the spiritual domain, very complete. In England a bishop, is only appointed with the sanction of the Hope at Home. In fact, I think they are all appointed by the Pope.

MR. HASAN IMAM. We want whatever power the Sultan possesses as the Khalif to remain undisturbed. We ask that the power Sultan exercises shall not be interfered with.

PRIME MINISTER. We never interfere with the spiritual power of the Pope in any part of the King&apos;s Dominions. We have certainly got tens, if not scores, of millions of Catholics in the Empire, but we never interfere with the spiritual dominion of the Pope, who is of course an Italian, and it is a very powerful dominion, and similarly we have no desire or intention to interfere with the spiritual authority of the Khalif.

MR. HASAN IMAM. If that Clause 139 remains, it is an interference with the position of the Khalif.

PRIME MINISTER. The Turks never raised that point. They do not seem to think that Article 139 interferes with them at all. 

MR. HASAN IMAM. If I may be permitted to say so, the Turks - whatever their capacity to negotiate, if I may so use the expression, for their own interests - whatever their capacity may be, 

I


I have already submitted to you that we do not represent theTurks, we come here as IndianMoblems, belonging to the Empire.ffl&amp;KE. MIlIETBIi.   4f1*er all, the Sultan is theirs specially, andthey never stated that article 1S9 was an interference,SEA 1215 KIDMa.1.   The lurks objected to this Article, - I meaneven the Constantinople Turks in their observations on theTreaty.    They clearly demanded the suppression of &quot;this Articlealtogether, as trenching on the domain of the Ehariat* ,iffiu EAEAM ISiAM.   They also think so now.Prime^ IflEISTEB.    They have never told - as that at the Conference.It has not, as a matter of fact, entered into our heads that wewere interfering&apos; in the least with the spiritual power of theKhalif,HE. ff&amp;d&amp;H IMM.    In that ease, it would go a long way to allayanxiety if that were made clear.fivlME HIIflSffBB.   You can assure the Moslems of India that thereis not the slightest intention to- interfere with the spiritualpower of the&apos;Ehalif in any part of thy world.EE. HA EAR KAM.    The result of this clause is - I have not heardit from the Turks - bat the result of it seems to rae to be asfollows : - Take for instance Tripolij    it was Turkish; the major portion of it was taken over by the Italians, but by treaty the religious suzerainty of the khalif was maintained in express,terms.    How, by this Article, that authority goes.    The way ittouches us Mohammedans of India is this, that If the Khalifrenounces his position as a khalif in respect of the people ofTripoli, he is weakening his own dominion, his religious dominion and if it concerned him personally, and no more, we would have nothing to say, but if my khalif gets weakened,  I naturally feelanxiety.   This Article seems to us to remove the Jurisdictionthat he exercises in Tripoli, religious jurisdiction in Tripoli:,I have given to you only one instance - there may be other -instances, but I give this one instance.   The original Treaty- regarding
regarding Tripoli I think is the Treaty of lansanne.   A mereassurance is not enough.   ,We want Article 139 expunged.1HIME MXWISjf&amp;B. I will make a note of that, and when we come tofinally settle up with the Turkish Government we will make itperfectly clear that we do not intend to interfere with thespiritual authority of the Khalif.    s?e do not want any mis-understanding on so important a matter to our Moslem fellowsubjects throughout the world.MB......HAdAH IMAM,   As you were pleased to observe on one occasion,the King Kiaperor was the largest Mohammedan ruler la the world.Your Mohammedan population is as much as one fourth.PKIMSMlBl^fSB.    It is our pride as an Empire that we do not interfere with the religious convictions of anybody.   We have got within it a larger variety of religious faiths probably than any other Empire in the no rid, and it is our pride, as it wasthe pride of the Koraan Empire before,   ftoey never interfered with the religious faith, conviction or worship of any part oftheir dominions, nor do we.egypt. EaAAxI i AM.    I can give you this assurance, Sir, that ifthe religious sentiments of the Mohammedans in the british dominions are considered and to them peace of mind is given, canthey think of living under any other Government?   Why should theyfhey would like to live under a system that supports them in the enjoyment of their religious feelings.    Shere is just one furtherpoint.    I do not know if you desire me to discuss - your time isvery short - these several items separately.    In connection KithConstantinople, wo have also got the question of the Straits,PRIMk. MIBIS1EK. If xptws. you would like me, before you go, totell you briefly what the view of the British Government is upon these subjects - unices there is something further that you wouldlike to press?I&amp;U KASAB IMAM. I have now stated the main points, and we pressedsome of them home in our first interview.
PRIES EIMETER.    I will tell you exactly -our view with regard toall these.    As to the evacuation of Constantinople - I am infavour of it, strongly,  I am in favour of our evacuatingConstantinople and leaving it to the Ottoman Government,With regard to the point about the vast crowd of refugeesof all sorts,  i deplore it.   The Russians were brought therenot by our wish;    I think, it was a mistake, a great pity thatthey were brought there j they will only be a source of disturbancebefore they are done, and i think it is very unfortunate that theyshould be there at all, but what can you do with a vast continentlike Russia where there has been a great deal of trouble andmassacre and the people are living in terror and fleeing- anywherethey can get to save their lives.    I put to the Turkish represen-tativee from Constantinople the question whether, if we evacuatedprotect themselves.    The moment they &amp;re in a position tothe place, the;y  v.ould be in ^position to/defend themselves in -regard to. the City, we are prepared to go.With regard to the Straits, the Dardanelles, after the ex-perience we have had, must be internationalised.    I do not think the Turkish Government will object to that.    The Dardanellesare not only tho entrance to Constantinople, they are the entrance to Bulgaria, Roumania and Russia, which is a greatsource of food supply and raw material to Europe, and the factthat the gates were closed against us prolonged, the war by atleast two years.    The Turks told me it was all done by a fewmen, notably Bnver and Talaat and that the Turkish nation wasnot behind them, out was in favour of maintaining the oldfriendship with England.    After all, we have spent a good dealof blood and treasure in supporting Turkey in the past against it assailants.    These men unfortunately insisted upon rushingTurkey into a quarrel with their old Allies, France and England.These two Rowers and Italy were the three Powers who stood by turkey when Russia was going to trample it out.    This lartyamong the Turks had however, to our surprise, suddenly slammedthe gates in our face.    That prolonged the war by two years,the re
there is no doubt about it, and we cannot take that risk again.The Straits, are so important- to the world outside that we musthare a sort of international guardianship.   That does not meanwe will occupy any considerable portion of Turkey, but we shalljust occupy the gates.   There is not very much of a populationthere at all.    I do not think the Turks mind that.MR. KASAg. IMAM.     May I say In regard to the straits, what we feelis that, should it ultimately be decided that the straits beinternationalised, at least Turkey should have the fullest freedom to cross from one side to the other if she has got to protectherself against Greece.    If that is not allowed, that portion ofTurkey which includes Constant inople will he exposed to endlessmenace from the Creeks, and therefore we submit this for your consideration,PRIME MIIJlSTEka    I am glad you put that point.With regard to Thrace, it is not a pure population of any kind, it is Creek, Armenian, Jewish, Bulgarian as well as Turk-ish.    It is the most mixed population in Europe, and I agree thatis an argument rather in favour of internationalising it and making a separate State of it than heading it over to&apos;Greece.I will tell you at once why we do not do that.    Intemationalisat ionmeans a garrison, and no one is ready to put a garrison there.We have not sufficient concern in it to keep a division of troopswith all the cost and anxiety it involves.    France has not, Italy has not, America certainly has not, and unless these.great powersput troops there to keep order you cannot internationalise it.Without the troops of the Croat Powers it would be like Macedonia.When the Bulgarians got there they killed the Creeks.   When theCreeks got the upper hand, they killed the Bulgarians.   TheSerbians did the same.   They all massacred each other for thelove of Sod, and then they said &quot;Ihy do not you people in Europegarrison the place?&quot;    It Is not worth it;   we have too many otherresponsibilities in the world to go to Macedonia to prevent theraces
races there from continuous internecine strife,   fhe real difficulty here is that if you internationalise it mease aninternational garrison, and no one is going to put in troopsthere, while tho effect of creating a neutral state without aninternational garrison would be that there would be such internaldisorder that soon there would be no population there, either( reek, fi&apos;urk, Mohammedan or Christian of any. sort or kind, andin a few years the country- would be a wilderness,   y.ou $ast putsome Power there.    Wo went into the statistics, and the onlyconclusion we came to was that on the whole there was a Creekmajority.   We set up a quite impartial Commission,   They went intothe matter, and had the Turkish figures before them and alsoimpartial American figures before them, and the conclusion theyoarae to was that there was a majority, not a very decided one Ibelieve, but that there were more Creeks than any one else.KaS&amp;B . B-.AM,     The Greek population consists of a largenumber of Kob ammo dans,IB 1MBJMIBISTiiiB.     Greek Mohammedans,  out they are Creeks.IB. KAiaAft IhAM.   They do not want any Government apart from theBultan&apos;e Gove government at,PKIhlS i MIlil^iTEB.    I am not in a position to argue out the questionof statistics because everybody produces a different set of statistics,    I am only pointing out that -what we did was tosubmit tho statistical question to an impartial Commission who reported in favour of tho Greeks.    if there had bee a a definiteMohammedan Turkish majority there, we should have left it inthe hands of the Mohammedan Turks.   What we wanted was someonewho would look after the people.    The Turk, unfortunately, hasnot in recent years managed things well in Europe.    Mis recordin governing other races is not very favourable.    la reseatyears he has not had a succession ox very good rulers - I suppose.Abdul Hamid was the at rouge st/haler they had on the whole - but unfortunately there has been frequent trouble these and it wasthat
that trouble that precipitated war in Europe,   The great european war really had its cradle In the Balkans.    That is where itstarted, and we thought we must&quot; have and end to this sort of thing.   The Turks, somehow or other, have not been able to keepthe peace; let us see, whether the Greek will do it better.    Iam not certain that he will, but let him have a chance.EE. HAM4Jri IMAM.   We do not admit your remarks about Turkishincapacity.    We feel that the Greeks will exterminate the Mussul-mans and their institutions.    Is it not possible to have&apos;at leastan autonomous State there?   The people of the place, whatever theyare, can determine what form of government they will have there.EEI.ME MlffI8ffBBT.   I have little doubt about what that would mean.After a period of disorder it would fall into the hands of the bulgarians.    I have no doubt that an autonomous State there fromwhich the Greeks were excluded would fall into the hands of theBulgers and I do not know that the Turks would be any betterpleased.    It is a part of the world where we would rather not interfere.    It is a place we would infinitely prefer to leavealone if we could.    It is not on our &quot;beat&quot;.MR. KASAff IEAM. fo speak frankly, what we feel in India is that although that ought to be the position and the attitude ofEngland, England as a matter of fact, has put Greece into Thrace,This is the feeling there,PRIM MIHI^TEB.     So, that is not so.    I think we were largelyresponsible for the Greek occupation of Smyrna,    fte are not responsible in the same way for Thrace.    That was the verdict ofa Commission which was American, Ereneh and Italian, as well as british, and they decided that Thrace ought to go to the Greeks?and until the decision was taken by all the Allies, Thrace w.soccupied by Allied and not Greek troops.    The same Commission,also on the statistical evidence before them, allotted Smyrna toffreeee.   We had our share of responsibility with the rest, butnot a particular responsibility for Thrace.    Smyrna I think wehave a very large - responsibility for, and I do not mind, pointing out- .io
out exactly way that was done.   At that time, in May 1919, Ithink;, the Italians were landing troops all along Asia Minorsad occupying town, aft-ar town, and were rapidly approachingBmjrn&amp;e   This was being done without the consent of the Powers,There was trouble in imyraa at the time and we felt that at themoment it was purely a question whether Smyrna was going to fall into the hands of the Greeks or Italians,    It is more a Greektown than it is Italian; there are not very many Italiansthere, but there are a very large number of Greeks &quot;there, and accordingly we, that is France, the United states and ourselves,asked Venizelos to occupy this place on behalf of the Towersuntil there was a decision.    We have therefore a special responsibility for Smyrna because we authorised the Greeks to occupy it, lor the reason given, before its destiny had beendecided,    I am very hopeful that the proposals now put forwardabout Smyrna will be accepted by the Turks,    we have made proposals which I think are a very considerable advance on theTreaty of aevres, and i am therefore encouraged to believe thatthe Turks will accept the proposals we put forward,    Withregard to its being a necessity for the economic prosperity ofAsia Minor, we fully accept that, and not only that, but that turkey should share in that economic prosperity from the pointof view of revenue as well.hill HAiiAJ- IMAM.   The proposed modifications make no material dlffe-rence.EKIMM MISISTMB.   As to the Arab States,  some of them are absolutelyfree from control.    I do not think however that any responsibleArab Chiefs would like to try the experiment&apos; of being absolutelywithout the support of a Great Western rower in Mesopotamia orSyria.    The;, are people who have not for hundreds of years hadcontrol of those states.   They are not a coherent people, theyare tribal....MR. HApiiA IMAM.    Some of them nomadic.
PRIME MINISTER.   Yes.     Even in the Hejaz there is constanttrouble between one Chief and another?    and I am certain inMesopotamia there would be endless feuds between tho varioustribes.     There are even two very powerful sects Of the Mohammedanreligion there, each occupying one end of the country.   All theseare elements which make for disturbance in Mesopotamia, and ifwe withdraw altogether - which we have &quot;been thinking of doingmany a time, and we are by no means wedded to remaining in.Meso-potamia, and If wo knew that there was a powerful Arab ruler whowould keep the country together and protect life and property and commerce there, we are not in the least concerned to remain there-what we are afraid of is that the moment we withdraw, these tribeswill be at each other *s throats.;    they owe no allegiance to eachother.     If they accepted some great Arab Chief and recognised him as the ruler, I think he would be the last man In the world toask us to clear out.     He would want our support., and I have seensome of these Arab Chiefs, very able men, and never have they asked us to clear- out altogether;   they have asked us to remainand give them advice and such support as is necessary, and I haveno doubt that support will be required for a good many years tocome.     Mr, Churchill Is out there now, he is in consultation withthe Arab Chiefs.     This very minute I have a telegram from, him,I was reading it when you came in.     He tolls me that he is inconsultation with the Arab Chiefs there.     We have given them a free choice of their own ruler.MR. HABAH IMAM.     If Feisul is allowed to form a Government of hisown, or any other- chief, for I have no particular leaning to Feisulor anyone, if he were allowed to make a State there, and our government were to leave the country to whoever was locally ofimportance there, whether Feisul or anyone else, and so leave themto
to do as they have done in the past, I think it wouJ * clear the atmosphere a great deal in India.     I may tell you,   /ithoutintending to give any offence - that has never been my intentionand ought not to be my intention - but I have to state the factthat the belief in India - I air- only giving that fact as a beliefI am not talking of the correctness of tho belief - but the belief-In that England has desired the breaking up of the Turkish EmpireThat is the belief,  and they point to certain circumstances:-with the object of acquiring territorial gain for herself,/- firstCyprus carved out.     How wo have Mesopotamia in the possession ofEngland and Palestine in the possession of England.     :-&quot;yria has gone into the possession of the French, and the belief In india has been sedulously circulated, whether by France I do not know,but the belief in India la that France and Italy favour the main-tenance of tho Turkish Empire but England is tho hindrance.IEEEE&apos; mieistke.   If France wishes the maintenance of the turkish empire why Is she in Syria?     Ihy is England to blame If Franceis in Syria?     Neither France nor Italy want the maintenance ofthe old Turkish Itoipire *SHAIKH EIDVfAI.       If England were to leave Palestine and Mosopo-tamia, France would probably leave Syria, otherwise France thinksshe must have a footing in the Hoar East.PRIME MI 1:11 tee.     I&apos;m sure that would not be the case.MR. HASAN IE7EE     I am not on whether it Is the fact or nefct, butam only stating the fact that there is a belief.PRIM;^/;INISTER.     There are so nany wild beliefs in the world thatI despair of putting them right, and all one can do Is to tract tothe common sense of the people of India as one is trusting to thecommon sense of the people in this country.     There are all sortsof opinions circulating In this country that it is hopeless to try and track them and all I can. say is that we are giving a largermeasure of self -government to tho Arabs in Mesopotamia than theFrench are doing to the Arabs in Syria at the present moment.I think that Feisul would be very delighted if the Arabs of Syriagot the same measure of self-government as we arc giving to the&quot;13&quot; Arabs
Arabs of Iraq.MR. HAiAAM IMAM.     I have bad an informal talk with Feisul, and I understood him to say, so far as his views were stated, to me bymeans of an Interpreter, I understood him to say that he wished tobe left alone In Arabia, and that there should bo no mandate.    Thatis what he told me last evening.PRIME l^IHlh^TE-M     VJhy did he not say that to us?     Feisul has seenus recently and he has not expressed that opinion to us.MR.

I do not know what his leanings are in regard toBritish cash, I have had no talk with him on the subject, but in ageneral sort of way, this Is what I understood him to say, that he wanted, to be left alone and did not want to be under a mandate.PRIME MIl-ilhTER.      If Feisul does not want any British assistance for mesopotamia, I think he ought to let us know that at once.     If he feels that if he were elected ruler of Mesopotamia by the people he does not need. British assistance, I think we had better- know it.MR. HAoAII IMAM.     What I understood from him yesterday was that he did not want any mandates over Arab States.PRIME MlhlSTScA      Well, I shall take note of that.

HH...JjASAH IMAM.    That Article was never framed with a view to that,I quite recognise that, and we have had the assurance given to ustime out of number that there was no intention on. the part ofEngland to interfere with the religious suzerainty.PRIME MINISTER.   It is quite contrary to our policy.MR. HA pen IMAM.    So it would be, I myself am not inclined to thinkthat that   is the Intention, but as it reads, it is -liable.....PRIME MIEISTER.    It may be liable to that Interpretation, and I havemade a note of that with a view to further discussions.MR. KASAH IMAM.    So far as the Turks are concerned, we have submit-ted In regard to Constantinople, and we are gratified to learn thatthere will be evacuation of Constantinople.PRIME MINISTER.    That In our Intention.MR. HASAN IMAM.    And in regard to the Straits, there is a questionof Inter-na11ona11s atIon .PRIME MINISTER.    Of the Dardanelles.ME. HA PAH IMAM.    Of the Dardanelles, and we are very anxious aboutthe protection that is required for Constantinople.     Constantinoplewill be completely unprotected if forcer, from the Asia Minor sideof Turkey are not given freedom, to come, uninterrupted freedom tocome over- to. Constantinople *PRIME MIRISTEM,    In the event of its being attacked - that I willmake a rote of.MR. .0A:&apos;./.&apos;.-. IMAM.    In regard to Thrace, that is for you to say whatthe position will be.    1 do not wish to repeat what 1 have already on another occasion submitted, but we cannot emphasise It too much,and 1 fee?! I would be failing in my duty if I did not press this one firrther aspect of it, that Constantinople without Thrace inthe hands of the Turks is in a defenceless condition.PRIME MIElPTiilR.    It was the lines at Chatalja that stopped the -&apos;victorious Buigar Array when the Turks were completely defeated andwere simply a mob of fugitives.      The lines of Chatalja are one ofthe most powerful defences In the world.     However I will considerthat point too. -
MR. HA BAH TM&amp;M.    The military position is now different, havingregard to aircraft development, long range guns, high explosives,etc.      In addition to what we have submitted, we are anxious aboutanother matter in regard to Thrace.     There, we have many sacredbuildings of the Mohammedans, the ancient tombs of the Khalifs atAdrianople, and if.you refer to the proportion of population fromthe papers I have mentioned, in the previous interview, it wouldappear that In the town the Muslim population is predominantlylarge.PRIME MIKIgTER.    Thrace is a very complicated problem.    If youtake Southern Thrace, the Greek population predominates.     Thefurther you. get from Constantinople the larger- the Turkish popula-tion.     That is one of the difficulties we had.     You. could notvery well leave Adrianople to the Turks, and Mid-Thrace right tothe sea to the Greeks,     Therefore, we had. to decide what we should do with Thrace as a whole.     That was our difficulty.     As a matterof fact, in the Bulgarian war it was first of all captured by the bulgarians, and if it had not been for the Internecine strugglebetween the Serbs, the Greeks, and the Buigars Adrianople wouldhave been Bulgar at this moment,MR. HAaAH IMAM.    I quite realise that, but if I may point outanother thing in connection with the population of Thrace, itwould be a mistake to class the population there - I say so with every respect - it would be a mistake to class the population there as Greeks and Turks.     It should be on tho basis of their religiouspersuasion, Mohammedan and non-Mohammedan.PRIME MINISTER.    I am not sure whether our statistics are based onreligion.MR. MERR.    There are some religious ones.MR. HA:-AH IMAM.   There I vnderstand It is Greek and. Turk.PRIME MIIilBTER.    I rather think It is Greek and Turk, I think youare right.      If Greek (And Turk is the classification, then it isnot a complete classification.MR. HACAH IMAM.    In Salonlca you have hardly any&apos;Mohammedan popula-
tion left, although there were many Mohammedans.PRIMS MINISTER..    I think, however, that Salonlca was overwhelminglyJew, neither Greek nor Turkish, but Jewish.MR.. KASAH IMAM,    There was a very large Mohammedan population.PRIME MINI -TIER,    Salonica was not separated In this wars the Turkslost it in the Balkan War.MR. HASAN IMAM.    I only mentioned that aa an&quot; instance ofwhat the greeks &quot;will do.     In the Greek War they took Thessaly and afterwardslost it and Salonica In the Balkan War.      After that, the Greekstreated the Mohammedans in such a way that the Mohammedans, although they were Greeks, practically disappeared, and their mosques and places of worship have been converted to uses which, according tothe Mohammedans * idea, are sacrilegious;PRIME MIEi:.:TER.    If Abdul Hamld had been alive the Turks would nothave been in this plight at all.     He was much too sagacious astatesman, to have allowed them to make the mistake of wantonlyattacking their old Allies, and, it is very unfortunate that theyshould, have done it.      It cost us a thousand million sterling,- andmany thousands of lives which we Mad not the &quot;slightest desire to spend upon attacking the Turkish Empire, not the slightest.     Wewdre forced to become enemies of the Turks, forced against ourwills.     We had not the slightest desire to quarrel with the Turks.There was nothing further from our minds when the War was started.SHAIKH M.H. KIDWAI.    In the mind of Russia I think there was neverthe slightest friendship for Turkey.PRISE MISISTER.    It was not Russia-that began it.     I agreeConstantinople was always in Russia&apos;s mind, but it was not Russiathat attacked.     That was the folly of Enver Pasha;    he went andbombarded Odessa.      If the Russians had bombarded Constantinoplethe Turks would have had a case.      But instead it was the Turkswho deliberately provoked the quarrel.MR^ BiUAE IMAM.    Was it not under compulsion?   Did Enver adopt theaggressive?PRIME MIEI&apos;,TER.    Yesj    and the Turks whom I had the pleasure of-17-
meeting here a fortnight ago said that they utterly n&apos; -udiated. him,MR. HAS Ah IMAM.    I cannot say that Saver Pasha has he peel his race,and I myself, when they declared war In. 1914, felt it was a mistake.As an Indian Mohammedan, I felt it was a mistake.PRIMS. MIHIcMJMR..   The -greatest mistake Turkey ever committed or anyother country.MR.- HA-&quot;AH IMAM.   There was a latent feeling amongst the Turksthemselves - at least In the mind of Silver Pasha - I do not knowwhether it was true, that there was a secret Treaty between Englandand Russia.     I saw it in the papers in India, that there was asecret Treat;/ whereby it was agreed that England would agree toRussia taking over Constantinople,PRIME Ml^IMIER^.   That . Tr6aty was made after the War began, in 1915.The War had been going on for 7 or 8 months before that was signed.MR. HA- AH IMAM.   There was no treaty before the War?PRIME MIHI.TER*    Oh no, certainly not.SHAIKH M.H. KIjWVAI.   Did not Lord Salisbury a long time before theWar, propose that Turkey should be divided up?PRIME MlEIiiTlR.   There was never a proposal that Turkey should be divided up;    at least 1 have never heard of it,     I have no doubt at all that the Kaiser told the Turks that to persuade them to comeinto the War.     Lord Salisbury was not the. man to do that.MR. HA h\H IMAJM    In regard to Palestine, I am only pressing thepoints, we beg you to consider If Palestine cannot be left as an arab State,PRIME MIHI.sT.ER.   That is impossible.    I have listened to all theother points you have made, and some of them I think I have met.I will also give careful consideration to the whole case you have madebut Palestine is quite impossible.     Oh, no, you could not go hackon that.     We are first of all committed to the Jews throughout theworld on that subject;    that is absolutely settled, and the Turksnever asked for that.
M%...HM* ff...SIREU.   1 mx n0*&apos; asking on behalf of the Turks.PRIME MIEEiTElM   Nor have the Arabs pressed for it recently unlessFoisul has been putting forward proposals to you.MR. HA,:ah IMAB.    I understood that from Felsul last night.     i cannot say that ho wanted it for himself, but he wanted it to bean Arab State.     Palestine, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Arabia Proper,without mandates - this is what he told me last evening, and whatis more, we did not know what he. wanted and what he did not want,but he said to us, Mir. Chotani, Dr. Ansari and. Mr. Kldwai were there,he said :    &quot;You are British, you have come, and demolished us, you have come and fought -as, you are British;   now, if you feel for us,if your religious feeling prevails in your mind, then it Is for you to press your Government.&quot;     This is what he said to met    &quot;It is foryou to press your Government&quot;.PRIME MINISTER.    I see.I4R. HA-AN IMAM.    What I have placed before you now is not at thoinstance of Felsul, but because I have been commissioned by IndianMohammedans to place this matter of Palestine before you also.....PRIEE El KI SEER.    On Palestine, I do not think wo can alter thepolicy we have adopted there. ,   It.Is a very mixed population, itis of course traditionally a-great Jewish country, and although the.Arabs are undoubtedly in the majority and should have their voice in the Government of the country, I think in view of the greatInternational place which Palestine holds - It holds;a differentposition from any other country in the world, It has a groat inter-national position where Jews, Mohammedans and Christians meet, allregard it as a sacred country, and they have got their sacredshrines there - therefore, Palestine is in a very different positioneither to Mesopotamia or Constantinople..MR. MR &quot;ME IMAM.    I suppose you know Jerusalem was our first Kaaba,Mohamme*   himself used to pray facing Jemsalem for fourteen years.Jerusali n was a Kaaba at a time when Jerusalem was not in the handsof the M-Eiammedans.
I        - &apos; 341gRIiJE MINISTER.   Therefore you see it is a place where Jews,Mohammedans and Christians meet, and all regard it as a sacred land.It is a shrine which is visited by hundreds of thousands of pilgrims.In view of its International character, we cannot change our policyand make it an Arab State. 1SSAIKII U.H. KXPhAX,   What promises did you make,to Feisul and hisfather?     What does Colonel.Lawrence say?. HASAH IMAM.,   So far as the town of Jerusalem Is concerned, nodoubt the tomb that Is there Is the subject of veneration for all of us, but I am not- talking of the actual custody of any particularplace of worship orsanctity, but so far as the country is concerned,Palestine, if the people of the place, whatever the population, were left to govern themselves, it would be. only-one more State andnothing else..PRXM3? MIHIctkr.   It is not merely the sepulchre of Jerusalem, butthe whole country is covered with Mohammedan and Christian shrines,everywhere and with Jewish shrines *     The Jew, the Christian, the muslim, they all moot there, and it is not merely one little spot,but the whole land bears that- character, and as a matter of fact, Itis kept going - it Is not a rich country - it is largely kept goingby the fact that it is a religious centre. &apos;.MR.. HA t___IM/ M,   It draws pilgrims &apos;from all over the world.PRIPM MliMI -TBR.    If It had hot been for that, there would have beena far smaller population there now, it is too barren a land.People pour into it from all parts of the world.     Three faiths meet&apos;there, and It Is garrisoned to-day by Mohammedan and by Christianand by Jewish soldiers as well.MR ^ J1A- A IT.....IMAM.   What will be the character of. the Government there?MRIhM Mini.,TSR.    That we have not finally decided,   but it will bea very different thing from Mesopotamiap   that will bo purely arab and we will leave the Arab to govern himself there with as littleinterfere  .ce as we possibly can, but Palestine is a different -thing,MR. HAbAK IMAM.    We are sorry you have to leave at once.     We haveifeS;i;e
to thank you for having given us this further opportunity.r^IKl; *TKK.   I have to thank you for the very clear way inwhich you have presented your cane.     At any rate, the Mohammedansof Turkey have had the advantage of a very powerful and ableadvocacy, and there are several points which have been modified in the Treaty largely as the result of the intervention of ourMohammedan fellow-sub Jests In India by presenting their casethrough the able advocacy which I have been privileged-   to listen to here.     I and my colleagues will give careful considerationto all you have said, and if possible, I will let you know thefur tier modifications which we shall press on our Allies, in viewof the representations you- have made on behalf of the Mohammedansof India. &apos; &apos;-21-
