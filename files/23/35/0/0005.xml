THB PRIME MINISTER said that he wished to coasaunioate tohis colleagues the gist of an interview that he had just had with M. Oleiuenoeau, who had arrived in London that morning.The discussion load been confined to the French Premier and himself, and had been of an inforiaal and friendly character.It was evident that M. Glesseneean entertained high expeota-tlona as the result of his visit.   It appeared that M.Cleiaeneeau was, on the whole, rather relieved that theUnited States had practically&quot; dropped out, and he favoured a Joint Angle-French Kote being sent to Washington askingwhat the American Governments intentions were, and did theyreally isean to have anything more to do with the peace settlement?   If net, the French and ourselves were quite ready to go ahead alone,   M, Cleoieneeau anticipated that theunited States, would, drop- out, and he.did not think it miehmattered whether they did or not.   M. Olesaeneeau was cosingto see him agn-in at S e* clock, that afternoon, and was bring-ing with hits a Paper containing the 14 - reservations to theproposed -Treaty with Germany, which had been submitted bythe Republican Party;   10 of these were itnssaterial, hut fourcould not be accepted by 6**eat Britain.   In particular, hebad - told M. Cleisenoeau that the reservation as regards theBritish Empire representatives must be retained, as otherwise the Pominiona would break away froai us.   H. Clemenceau, onhearing this, promised to stand by us in this question.The French Premier&apos;e view wan that the United States would continue to support us, supposing there were, trouble withGeria&amp;ny, as American pride was involved.    It was scissionknowledge that the Aiaer leans- Imagined that they had won theWar, and they would feel bound to see the thing through. ,     IMr Lloyd George, proceeding, said that M. Cleajeneeau. thenreviewed the whole situation.   He jsealiaed that, owing to
America&apos;s defection, everything now depended on Great Britain. He anticipated a revolution, in Italy, as there was no-one there with any authority at all; there was no-one in Italy with sufficient authority to append, his name to any Agreement: on the whole, therefore, M, Clemenceau thought that Italy would drop out of the Alliance. Mr Lloyd George said that he had impressed upon M. Clemenceau that the first thing to do  was to re-create mutual confidence as between France and England, and he had referred to unjustifiable attacks which had been made upon Great Britain in the French Press. The French Premier replied that the Press campaign was really inspired by M. Peincare, who was behind the Quai d&apos;Orsay in this matter, and it was designed to injure not England but M. Clemenceau himself. M. Clemenceau volunteered the observation that it was a great pity that the two Prime Ministers had not had opportunities of meeting more frequently, as such meetings would have obviated many misunderstandings. As regards the ADRIATIC, M. Clemenceau agreed that it was very important not to quarrel with the Yuge-Slave, and he proposed that afternoon to produce a draft Agreement for Mr Lloyd George&apos;s inspection. This Agreement, M. Clemenceau thought, offered a solution. Mr Lloyd George said that he had reminded M. Clemenceau that England usually did better than her word; for instance, she had promised 6 Divisions in the event of war, and had provided ?. M. Clemenceau appeared to be well satisfied about SYRIA and CILI?IA. He had stated that he had come to an amicable understanding with Feisal.  As regards ARMENIA, he would not touch the question: he was not disposed to worry about the wretched Armenians any further. It further appeared that he did not really care whether the Sultan was allowed to remain in CONSTANTINOPLE or to be Kept out of it:  he would, however,  prefer to have him there, with a joint Anglo-French control of the

(Mr Lloyd George) that it was no use discussing these questions with Signer Scialoja.

As regards RUSSIA, M. Clemenceau had not taken an encouraging view. In his opinion the Russians were Orientals and were thoroughly enjoying themselves at the present moment with their fighting, their tortures, and so on, and he had come to think that we had made a great mistake in interfering. He. was clearly taking now the purely non-intervention line, as he had undoubtedly been strongly influenced by the recent Elections in France, which had convinced him that there was no danger of Bolshevism spreading into that country, where the population consisted largely of small-holders. M. Clemenceau had also stated that he did not apprehend any danger of Bolshevist infection in GERMANY. The German people were temperamentally lovers of order and discipline. Mr Lloyd George said he put the Savinkoff  proposal before the French Premier, which, as had been stated at the Conference on the previous evening, had been to summon all non-Bolshevist states to to meet the loyal Russians, the Caucasus States and others, to a Conference over which the French and English would exercise a certain supervision. M. Clemenceau had told him that France had spent 750,000,000 francs on RUSSIA, but this almost certainly must have included her expenditure on POLAND. The French Premier was absolutely opposed to any dealing with the Bolsheviks. As regards POLAND M. Clemenceau thought of that country not in reference to Russia but in respect of Germany only. He was not in the least interested in the BALTIC STATES, except so far as they might present a buffer against German aims. He had never liked General Denikin, probably because he regarded him as a British proteg√© and Admiral Koltchak he did not like because of his past. Russia, M. Clemenceau  had said, had always been badly governed.

Clemenceau thought ofthat country not in reference to Bussia but in respect ofGermany only,   He was not in ib^ieaet interested in theBALTIC STATES, except so far as they might present a bufferagainst German aims.   He had never liked General Denikin,probably because he regarded hita as a British pyptrg,ge&apos;*. and admiral Koltehak he did not like because of bis past,   tossia.Li. Clemenceau had said, had always been badly governed.
It seemed that he would like POLAND to maintain a strong army which could be called in to assist us in the event of trouble with Germany.

As regards GERMANY M. Clemenceau thought that the present Government was bound to disappear, and would be succeeded by a Militarist Government, This, however, would only be a phase, and in any case there was no need  to fear the temporary advent of a Militarist Party, as the German people had had quite enough of fighting.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR F0REIGN AFFAIRS enquired whether M. Clemenceau thought that the new Government in Germany would be Monarchist, as well as Militarist.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that M. Clemenceau&apos;s view was that it would be Hindenburg, but he evidently had no great opinion of Hindenburg. The French Premier thought that we should have trouble with Germany for the next two years, necessitating constant pressure on the part of the Allies.

In reply to a question by Lord Curzon, Mr Lloyd George said that M. Clemenceau had not raised the question of our guarantee of the INTEGRITY OF FRENCH SOIL. Mr Lloyd George had told him that there was bound to be opposition in Parliament if we undertook to give a separate guarantee. In this connection he had impressed upon M. Clemenceau that everything, depended on the atmosphere in which these problems were faced, and M. Clemenceau had agreed as to the desirability of re-cresting the fraternal relations which had existed until a few months ago. M. Clemenceau had been particularly keen on ECONOMIC QUESTIONS. It appeared that he thought that our interest in HUNGARY covered some deep political game. He had endeavoured to reassure M. Clemenceau by saying, that he personally had absolutely no knowledge of any such underlying motive, and he had reminded him that
ever since the days, of Koesuth the British sympathy withHungary had been based upon a traditional feeling.   In respectof MOROCCO M. Clemenceau had declared his complete ignoranceabout the subject.   He (Mi? Lloyd George) therefore suggestedthat Lord Curson should see the representative of the Pmmh.Foreign Office and discuss the question.(Lord Guraon undertook to see H.Berthelotthat afternoon and discuss- the Moroccan &apos;question.)THE SECRETARY. OF STATE FOR WAR reminded the conference that Parliament was still under the impression that therewould be an Allied Conference on Russia.   If this conference was not to take place, Parliament and the world in general. ought to be Informed at ones that our policy now was one of4 complete non-intervention, so that the wretohed people inRussia, who were still relying upon our assistance, mightknow their fate.THE mim &amp;IMISTBR quite agreed, and said that his last public announcement (which bad been at the Guildhall)on cur policy in Russia had been grossly distorted by amischievous Press, the repercussion of which was to be foundin the Benlkln newspapers.   Proceeding, Mr Lloyd George saidthat M. Clemenceau had told him the French were very muchalarmed about the FINANCIAL FOSITIOM and the Exchanges inparticular.   The matter had been discussed only the previous day in.the French Cabinet., when two -miggestlene had been putforward.   The first of these was to suppress all importsexcept food and other vital national essentials.   When itwas found that the remaining imports wss only amounted to IS&quot;per cent, of the whole, this proposition had been dropped.The second suggestion was for the-French Government to takeover all the foreign funds in the country.   But this, again,was vetoed when it was discovered that only 80,000,000 francs-6- &apos;
pev annum were involved.   The French-Government had thenfallen hack upon.a Loan for tho devastated areas, which M.Glemsnoeau had acknowledged could only he balanced- on theBudget by taxation.   The French Premier had said that he intended to substitute -M. louokkt/R &quot;for M, KLotz as Ministerof&apos;Finance, and had telegraphed to 1 . Louoheur to come overat once in order to talk over financial questions with theChancellor of the Exchequer.   Mr Lloyd George said that hehad told. M. Clemenceau that it was essential at once to clear up the misunderstanding between the French and the Englishin regard to two&apos; important questions.-(a) gSPAHATIOH:(h) W%&amp;m-* &apos;THE GKANGKLLOB OP TKI EXGHF4U8J? said that when M.Loucheur had recently been in London the (hS declined to- /discuss these two questions with him.   Moreover, France hadrepudiated her agreement with Lord Inverf ortht whom  hLouoheurhad absolutely refused to meet,, about the taking over of cer-tain surplus stores in France,   II. Loucheur had said to him,-*Can we not mike some general agreement, and say to theCaeoho-Slovaks* for instance, &quot;Unless you send coal toHungary we will not give you this, or that&apos;:   similarly, wecan bring pressure to hear on the Hungarians -to release - wheat:in ether words, why could not Great Britain and France act%e the Pietatore of Europe, in accordance e with a consideredagreement?*.   M. Loucheur had recognised that it would beimpossible to float successfully a French Loan in Londonuntil the French Government had.put their financial house inorder.-   On M. Loucheur &quot;asking &quot;whether Sir Sohn Bradbury could go to Paris and discuss this question with him, he had pointedout that Sir John Bradbury was no longer a Treasury official.and he doubted whether this proposal would be consistent with
53X1? .roim Bradbury&apos;s present position.   He bad, however, seen -Sir John Bradbury about it, and the latter had agreed to goto Paris and see M. Loucheur.   As H. Loucheur had been tele-graphed for by M. Clemeneeau, he would arrange to wire toSir John Bradbury to return to England at once.   In his (mr chamberlain&apos;s) view, the question of REPARATION was too bigfor Great Britain and Prance to .tackle alone.   In this, matter the United States of America must be our mainstay, and he did-not eee why they should refuse to assist, as it was really a matter not of sentiment but of business.   Further, not onlythe United states but the whole of the Neutrals must realisehow deeply they were concerned in the rehabilitation ofEurope.   As regards the proposed&apos;Loan in London, he had-told M. Loueheur that the terms would probably be-much mere onerousthan he imagined, and he had a&amp;id that he was really at hiswits&apos; end to find resources to meet our own liabilities here.THE PRIME SOTX&amp;T8R said that he would be glad, if the&apos;Chancellor of the Exchequer would carry out his suggestion and get Sir John Bradbury back to England, in order to advise the Chancellor of the Exchequer when he discussed the questionof Reparation with M, Loucheur, supposing.the latter came over.He was very anxious that the question of Reparation should be definitely settled before M. Clemenceau left for France.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that he had just received from Mr f&amp;thhone, the United States Financial Repre-sentatiwe In Paris, a statement ef the policy of the UnitedStates Treasury.   This was a most discouraging document.   Hewas,&apos;however, replying to it at once.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the- discussion he had had that morning had revealed the fact that, M. Clemenceau was strongly pro-Austrian, and was most anxious to help thatunhappy country.
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOB WAR thought that if we would relinquish the idea of INDEMNITIES, Austria would be able to hold its own.

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that Sir John Bradbury had bean looking into this question, and was of opinion that Mr Churchill1&apos;s proposal would only be a make-shift and would offer no permanent solution.

THE SECRETARY  OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS informed the Conference that he was suggesting to the Treasury that we should at once send two or three shiploads of coal to starving Vienna, if shipping were available and the Treasury would give their consent. He pointed out the great effect that this would have upon Austrian sentiment, if they received these loads of coal as a present from Great Britain.

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that he would consider the question most sympathetically: but he must remind the Conference that coal at present was our only financial asset.

THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF EDUCATION thought that the main difficulty in relieving the situation in Austria was the shortage of trucks.

The Prime Minister asked the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to arrange that an official of the Foreign office should be in attendance at 10, Downing street, at 3 p.m. that afternoon, when he was again to see M. Clemenceau, for purposes of consultation in case he (Mr Lloyd George) wished to be more fully informed of certain details about Turkey.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had suggested that Signor Scialoja should be invited to attend some of their Conferences, and M. Clemenceau had signified his willingness that he should do so.  He had also said that he was quite prepared for an invitation to be sent also to the American


Ambassador,   It appeared that M. Clemen ee&amp;u was not oon-contemplating a formal Inter-Allied Conference, but merely a succession of friendly conversations, to Which Allied repre-aentatires might be invited.. She Prime Minister asked the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affaire to see Mr.&quot;Davis and Signer Seialoja, a&amp;d requeatthem to be good enough to hold themselvesin, readiness to attend at suoh a Confer-enoe tomorrow,&apos;Friday, December ISth.He further asked the Ministers present to be prepared to meet him again that afternoon, after Ma interview with Iff.- clemencoau . in order that he might keep- them au eourant with the progress theywere makingsSubsequently, the Prime Minister asked the Secretary to add the following:-M. Clemenceau had said: &quot;you have no Army 01*.the Shine,neither have I.&quot;   M. Clemenceau did not believe that germany had any Army, either.   Marshal Foch affected to believe thatthey had a great Army, his object being that one day he might,if necessary, be able to turn, round and say: &quot;you didn*t leaveme enough troops.&quot;fbiteh&amp;ll Gardens, S.W.1.,December 11, Ifla.
