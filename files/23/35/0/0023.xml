(This Document is the Property of His Britannio.Majesty&apos;s Government.)SECRET -S r, ^SS oTHE COAL STRIKE,NOTES of a Meeting held in Mr Bonar.Law&apos;s Room at theSouse of Commons, S.W.1, on MONDAY, OCTOBER 25,1920, at-50 p.m.PRESENT:-FOR THE GOVERNMENT.The Prime Minister.Mr Bonar Law.Sir Robert Horne.Mr Bridgeman.The Coal Controller.Sir Maurice Hankey.FOR THE MINERS1   FEDERATION.Mr Smillie.Mr Frank Hodges.Mr Robson.Mr Herbert Smith.The meeting was held in order to enable the representa-tives of the Miners&apos;  Federation to clear up certain points on the scheme based on values, which had been presented tothem at the IS-15 meeting, before putting the principle for decision before their Executive.Mr SMILLIE pointed out that the scheme based on valuesdid not differ in its essentials from the scheme based on output, since, b&amp; in the main, profits would depend on output.    Both schemes were open to the same objection, thatthe miners were liable to be penalised by a reduction oftheir increased wages owing to causes over which they would
have but little control.    For this reason it would be dif-difficult to induce the men to accept either scheme.THE PRIME MINISTER and Mr BONAR LAW pointed out that theJoint Committees would give the miners the power of ensuring that the mine owners played their part.    It would enablethem to give publicity to any neglect on their part to do so,and to bring the pressure of other mine owners to bear on arecalcitrant mine owner,,THE COAL CONTROLLER attached importance to the latter &apos;point.Mr SMILLIE thought it was unfair that men who       mightbe doing their best should be liable to fail for causesover which they had no control, and to be penalised fortheir failure.    It would be better to trust to the honour ofthe miners.    Nevertheless, he admitted that he and hiscolleagues were &quot;up against it&quot;, and that some scheme oflinking wages with output was unavoidable.    If some means could be found to achieve this, the four men on that sideof the table would not oppose it.    He then gave instancesto illustrate the powerlessness of the miners to bring pressure on the mine owners in cases where the managementwere notoriotisly not doing their utmost to obtain output.Whole-hearted co-operation between mine owners and minerswas essential to increased output.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that, as he had indicated that morning,&apos; the Government had seen certain mine owners,and, though these had not been able to commit the whole body of the owners, they had not denied that the ownersmight be induced to give some guarantees.Mr SMILLIE pointed out that this only applied to theoutput scheme, and not to the scheme based on profits.    he asked if it could not be extended to the latter scheme.
THE COAL CONTROLLER gave an explanation of the difficul-ties of any such extension.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had been very stronglyimpressed with the case made by Mr Smillie that morning onthis point. The miners were asked, if certain conditions were not realised, to give up their increased earnings, andhe quite understood how much it would help in getting thescheme accepted by the miners if the owners were asked togive some corresponding guarantees.Mr SMILLIE said that under present conditions the owners had not sufficient incentive   pecuniary incentive   todevelop their mines to the fullest possible extent, owingto the statutory limitation on their profits.Mr BONAR LAW pointed out that this point had expresslybeen reserved until a permanent scheme was under consid-eration.    It had been felt that, in a provisional and temporary scheme, the miners could never have been induced to accept any addition to the owners&apos; profits.Mr SMILLIE and Mr HODGES then asked if a longer period than a single month could not be taken for calculating theprofits?    Instead of comparing the profits for Novemberwith the profits for September, they proposed that twoperiods of. three months should be taken;    e.g., the compari-son might be between three months ending December 31st. andthree months ending September 50th.    By February the profitsfor the quarter ending December 31st. would be accuratelyknown, which would not be the case by the end of Novembereven for that month.    Moreover, by February the permanentwages scheme ought to be ready.    If the necessary outputhad not been reached, account could be taken of it in thepermanent scheme.    The reason for this delay was that itwould take some time for the full output to be reached-3-
after the strike, partly owing to material causes, such asthe need for repairs, etc., and partly because some time was necessary to enable the Miners&apos;  Federation to get thescheme understood by the miners.Mr BONAR LAW said that, as one who had great experience in the iron trade, which was very like the coal trade, he anticipated that when prices stopped soaring there would bea slump.    This was one reason for not taking too long aperiod.    It might result in profits falling and thus pre-venting the men from realising their increased wages.THE PRIME MINISTER said that his enquiries had indicated a real probability of a fall in coal prices.    If this occurred, and the men&apos;s 2/- was taken off, the results would be deplorable.    The miners would lose all confidence in their leaders and in the owners, and would get completelyout of hand.    To provide against this, it had been proposedto take the September prices as fixed prices for calculating the profits in this scheme.    This would safeguard theminers against loss.    On the other hand, it was, of course,conceivable that prices might rise.    In that event theminers would gain by taking the risk of the market.    TheMiners&apos; Executive would have to choose between the security-of calculating the prices on the September figures andgambling on the risk of the market.    If they preferred the september prices, the pool would have to take the risk, andin any event the miners would get their 2/-.Mr SMILLIE said that the main object was to reach asettlement which would not break down before a permanentwages scheme had been worked out.There was then some further discussion as to the period to be taken, in the course of which the Government repre-sentatives suggested that from the middle of November
until the middle of December was a good period.    It wouldgive sufficient time to get the output going;    the ma wouldhave every incentive to work after the strike;    and itavoided the Christmas holidays.    The representatives of theminers were asked to consider it, which they undertook to doMr HODGES said he was becoming impressed with the risk to the miners in depending on export prices,. which were soliable to fluctuation.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed that this basis was only suit-able to a provisional scheme of short duration.Mr SMILLIE asked whether it would not be possible to date the increased wages back to October 1st.    This would helpimmensely in getting the scheme accepted by the miners.THE REPRESENTATIVES OP THE GOVERNMENT indicated that thiswould be a very difficult concession for them to make, inview of the strike.Mr HODGES pointed out that under the output scheme,although 248,000,000 tons had been the nominal rate of out-put as the datum,&quot;the real datum line had been 246,000,000tons, since the 2/- was not to   be reduced until the outputfell below that figure.    In the scheme based on profits, ifthe profits were  1 under  2,400,000 the miners would haveto give up their 2/-.SIR ROBERT H0RNE pointed out that both schemes had been drawn up on precisely the same lines; in fact, if anything,the miners were a little better off under this scheme.THE PRIME MINISTER said he thought Mr Hodges could trustthe Government to interpret the scheme rationally; if, forexample, profits came very close to the  2,400,000.After some further discussion, the meetingadjourned in order that the Miners&apos; Repre-sentatives might consult their Executive.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,October 25, 1920.
