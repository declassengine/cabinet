Notes of a Conversation between the Prime Minister and the Crown Prince of Roumania, at 10, Downing Street, S.W. on Saturday, September 11th, 1920 at 9.45 a.m.

The Crown Prince of Roumania was accompanied by M. Boeresco, and the Prime Minister was accompanied by Sir Maurice Hankey. The interview began with some conversation of a general nature, in the course of which the Crown Prince mentioned that Roumania had a good harvest this year, although this was qualified later by M. Boeresco, who explained that in some parts of the country the peasants were only cultivating their own holdings with the result that considerable tracts of country were left entirely uncultivated. The Crown Prince stated that Roumania&apos;s great difficulty at the present time was transport, and that according to latest reports this was deteriorating rather than improving.

The conversation then turned to Roumania&apos;s position vis-a-vis Soviet Russia, and after some general remarks as to the difficulty of dealing with a people who showed so much bad faith, M. Boeresco asked the Prime Minister point blank what his advice would be as to Roumania making peace with Soviet Russia. He explained that in no event did Roumania contemplated hostilities with Soviet Russia, but the question really was as to whether they enter into peace negotiations now or fence with the Russian proposals and play for time.

The Prime Minister replied that if they wanted his advice he would say that Roumania would probably get better terms from Soviet Russia than from any Russian Government which might take its place. Later he developed this point a little explaining that supposing General Wrangel was successful, he was not likely to be more accommodating than Soviet Russia about Bessarabie. Moreover, at the present time, Soviet Russia was rather pressed owing to their


their defect at the hands of the Poles and the menace of Wrangel&apos;s forces in the South. For these reasons they would be more likely to be in an accommodating spirit.

In reply to a question by M. Boeresco, he said that at the moment it appeared doubtful whether a London Conference would take place. Consequently, he did not think it was worth while for Roumania to risk her prospects of getting peace on the ground that she might get better terms at the London Conference.

At this point the question was raised of the Alliance between Roumania, the Jugo-Slavs, and the Czecho-Slovaks. M. Boeresco explained that this was a purely defensive Alliance, intended to safeguard the countries concerned against aggression from Hungary or Bulgaria. He stated that M. Venizelos was very favourable to the entry of Greece into this Alliance, and he intimated that M. Take Jonescu had great hopes of being able finally to bring about Greek participation perhaps when he visited London. He further stated that M. Take Jonescu was very anxious to have a common frontier with the Poles in Eastern Galicia and for this reason hoped that Poland would retain some hold on Eastern Galicia. The Prime Minister said that he had always been doubtful about the expediency of including Eastern Galicia in Poland. At the Peace Conference in Paris he had formed the conclusion that the people of Eastern Galicia were not Polish by origin

 
origin, nor inclined by sympathy to place themselves under Polish rule. He had always advised the Poles against creating for themselves a discontented province in Eastern Galicis.

The Crown Prince, while admitting that the Poles had quarrelled with most of their neighbours, stated that this did not apply to Roumania, who had always got on very well with the Poles.

From the discussion of the Poles the question turned to the Jewish problem, which is common to Poland and Roumania. The Crown Princes stated that the Jewish population of Galicis  was about 800,000. 

They consisted in the main of petty tradesmen and small money-leaders. They are evidently unpopular in Boumanis excepting in Bucharest, where the rich bankers are Jaws and were stated by the Grown Prince and M. Boeresco to be very good Roumanian citizens. M. Boeresco said that the Jaws in Roumania wars of a type superior to the Jaw in Poland and that the Roumanian Government had every hope of a satisfactory solution of the Jewish problems. In fact, he stated that the present Government of Roumania is a firm and stable one. General Avere?, the Prime Minister, is personally very popular, owing to his record in the war and ha has a strong Ministry, which it is hoped will become still stronger if, as anticipated, Veld? Voeved the late Prime Minister, joins it.

The Prime Minister intervened at this point and expressed satisfaction at this news. A strong and stable Roumania, he said, was of great importance to the peace of Europe. He was strongly of opinion that 

Roumania
Roumania should make peace with soviet Russia. He recalled that last January in the same room he had given the same advice to M. Pathek, the Polish Foreign Minister. M. Pathek had called attention to the bad faith of the Bolsheviks and he had asked him if he could guarantee a peace, if it were made, and he had replied that he could not. He had than warned M. Pathek that if they attacked soviet Russia the whole of Russia would simply recall that the Poles were foreign invaders and would really get the support of the Bolsheviks. M. Boeresco observed that even though there might have been some wild talk of Roumania attacking Soviet Russia no political party had suggested it. The Prime Minister, continuing, said that Roumania now had a great country, double the size of pre-war Roumania. In reply to the suggestion by M. Boeresco that Roumania was justified in defending her frontier, he expressed agreement. Roumania, he said, should defend her own frontiers. If she limited herself to this she would receive the sympathy of Western Europe, and if attacked, would probably receive such help as could be spared. So long as she adopted a defensive attitude, it rendered it easier for the Governments of Western Europe to persuade their Parliaments to give assistance in the form of arms, munitions, etc., if she was attacked. The difficulty with the Poles had been that they had so far antagonised public opinion that Parliament had shown itself indisposed to help them. Provided Roumania showed a disposition to make peace, she would get the sympathy of the world with her. It was peace that the world wanted. It would be an advantage to Roumania to get a Treaty conferring Bessarabia on her, signed by same de facto Russian Government. Once Roumania had got Bessarabia in this way, it was unlikely that anyone would attack her.

M. Boeresco then stated that the Beasarabian Treaty agreed to by the Powers had not yet bean signed. Lord Hardings had told him that the British Ambassador in Paris had been given full powers to sign
sign and that there were no difficulties as regards the British Government. He was somewhat puzzled to know why the signature had not taken place.

The Prime Minister undertook to make enquiries on this point and instructed Sir Maurice Hankey to take the necessary action. M. Boeresco thanked the Prime Minister and stated that the Minorities Treaty had been ratified  and all formalities compiled with, so that no obstacle to the Bessarahian Treaty was to be  found there.

Towards the and of the conversation M. Boeresco raised the question where the peace negotiations should take place. Both the Crown Prince and he expressed great unwillingness to discuss peace terms at Kieff or any Russian town. They would prefer some neutral country. He asked if the Prime Minister would have any  objection to the Roumanian Government proposing London for the negotiations.

The Prime Minister, replied that he would not raise objections to such a proposal.

Subsequently the possibility of a Conference at Geneva was raised by M. Boeresco, and the Prime Minister expressed the view that the Swiss Government would not care to have a Bolshevist Delegation present there.

H. Boeresco than proposed Copenhagen as a possibility. In conclusion there was Some conversation about the general state of affairs in Roumania, in the course of which the Crown Prince and M. Boeresco mentioned that 75 per cent of the oil plant had bean repaired. 50 per cent of this had been done by the Germans before they left. The Roumanian oil was now in the hands of the British-French-Roumanian syndicate. Sir Albert Stern was the head of the British Section which was backed by the Angle-Persian oil Company. M. Bratiano&apos;a name came up and it was mentioned that ha had now only 7 supporters in Parliament and was working wall with the present
