N
il PEAof CON- U) ^ PriiaS Minister said that he had seen M. ClemenceauFERENCg^ on the previous day, and that LI. Clemenoeau hoped to be ableto finish off the -questions of Flume and Russia, but oouldnot undertake to start any &apos; new discussion, such as the r,;ast-ern Question.   The British Ambassador had called on him thatmorninr and had confirmed this.    Sir Maurice Hankey had in-formed him that on the following morning the following ques-tions would be discussed at the Supreme council the Caucasus,The Adriatic,The Administration of Western Thrace.*?M. CI^vtPNCFlACS    (3) The Prime Minister mentioned that Lord Derby had in-P.R0P0SKP VISIT to egypt. formed him that morning that Li. Clemenceau was desirous of paying a visit to Egypt in order to obtain a complete rootand change, but that he would not do so if there was any ob-Section on the part of the British Government.    On receivingthis request he had communicated with Lo*id curzon, who sharedhis own view that there was no objection, and that every possible facility ought to be offered to I!. Clemenceau toobtain an enjoyable holiday in Egypt,During the meeting the Prime Minister signed and despatched a letter in this sense to II. Clemenceau.RUSSIAN POLICY. (4) The ?&quot;ine ! Sinister commenced the discussion by summingThe Caucasus.up the latest information on the subject of Russian Policy.LI. Nitti had had breakfast *ith Mm that mo;ning, and had raised this question.    Ke had shown himself very hostile to russian intervention.    He did not  even believe in the ^barbed wire&quot; policy.    He had asked the question   supposing affija^an+ee is riven to Poland and Poumania, both of whom have advanced, as indeed the Poles admit, beyond thei:&apos;ethnographic boundaries, would the Western Allies be committed to giving them support?   Italy could not do so,and a. Nitti doubted if Prance could,  either.    He was o&quot;posseto encouraging people anywhe-e if, in the event of their
 being beaten it would involve a choice between either their abandonment or embarking on a fresh war. In M. Nitti&apos;s view Soviet Russia was very bad, but nevertheless Russia had accepted this form of Government. He had stated, however, that in his opinion Bolshevis? was done for, and had disappeared except in name. The Soviets had now taken into their Government some of the aristocracy and bourgeoise classes. M. Nitti went much further than N. Clemenceau, being absolutely opposed to the "barbed-wire" policy. In reply to Mr Long, he said that M. Witti&apos;s view was that if the Bolshevists were only let alone they were not going to attack when militarism was in the ascendant. As long as you made war you tended to create Bolshevism. "Stop the war", said M. Nitti, "and Bolshevism will gradually decline".

Mr Bonar Law pointed out that the logical deduction from M. Kitt&apos;s remarks, though he had not himself made it in so many words, was that it was desirable to make peace with Soviets.

Mr Churchhill observed that that, at least, was a definite policy.

Lord Curzon thought that, from what he had heard M. Nitti say, he was in favour not of the "barbed-wife" policy but of what might be termed? the "chain" policy, by which he meant that a chain of States encircling Russia would be assisted by arms, Munitions, and other war material, to resist the Bolshevists if they crossed the border.

Mr Churchill pointed out that this was neither Peace no? War.

Lord Curzon replied that this was really the present policy of the Allies.

The Prime Minister said that the question which would be raised on the following day was as to whether Georgia and the Azerbaijan were to be told that, in the event of their undertaking to resist the Bolsheviks, the would be 




 assisted by some or all of the following methods:-

(a) The supply of arms:

(b) The despatch of x Divisions to help them hold the Batoun-Baku line:

(c) By the British Navy taking over the Caspian Fleet.

In the event of (a) and (b) being adopted, would the British nation undertake it themselves, or only in conjunction with the Allies? (c) would, of course, be an entirely British operation.

Mr Churchill pointed out that Italy might at once be omitted from the discussion. Great Britain had a supreme interest in the Caucasus and the Caspian in connection with the defence of India. France had a great interest in the defence of Poland. (The Prime Minister added "and Cilicia".) Italy, however, had no special interest in the Caucasus.

The Prime Minister then asked the Chief of the Imperial General Staff to express his views.

Field-Marshal Wilson said that, as instructed, he had a meeting with the representatives of Georgia and the Azerbaijan. The net result was that the Azerbaijan could produce 10,000 troops and 50 guns. One difficulty in their case was that many of their officers were Turks. The Georgians could produce 30,000 troops and 150 guns. Their rifles were mainly of old pattern and inferior in quality. As regards population, Georgia had 31/2 millions. The total number of troops at present was 40,000 men and 200 nuns? for the two States. The line Batum-Baku was 500 miles in length, which worked out at about one battalion to 20 miles. They required that we should command both the Black Sea and Caspian, otherwise they would not undertake to hold the line at all. Georgia wanted to be fed entirely, and the Azerbaijan wanted some food for itself. The Azerbaijanians also stated that they were feeding 350,000 Armenians?, and they would wish the Allies?

  
 to take that over. Further, the two states asked that recognition should be given to the Armenian Government as a de facto Government, and they desired the help of the Armenians for the defence of the Caucasus. Mr Tseretelli had done a good deal of the talking, but had been constantly interrupted by another delegate. II. Tseretelli did not pretend to know very much of the military situation. He had said that the two countries were friends, and that their General Staffs had stusied the question. They were ready to fight to the last man.    It would, however, be necessary for them to raise large forces, and for this they had no equipment or arms, beyond those for the existing forces already mentioned. On the previous day the Prime Minister had somewhat surprised him by a reference to the successful resistance of the Caucasian States to the Russians. He had traced back the history of Georgia to the year 1212 A.D., and could not find any case where they had not given in to every enemy. The last thing they had done, and the most cowardly of all, was to hand over Batum to the Turks two years ago. Their record was one of constant cowardice. They had surrendered in turn to the Arabs, the Turks, the Persians and the Russians, and had constantly asked the help of each of these countries against the other.

Lord Curzon expressed some doubt as to this historical summary. According to his recollection, the Russians had had a great struggle to conquer the Caucasus, which had lasted for forty or fifty years, at the end of which they had captured Tiflis. This fighting contained some very heroic exploits by the defenders, and they had produced a great leader, whose name was SCHAMYL. Of course he could not discriminate as to what part the Georgians in particular had played in these wars.

Field-Marshal Wilson stated that in the year 1300 Georgia had played herself under Russian protection


 against the Turks and Persians. In 1703 a Georgian Prince had raised the flag of revolt, but this had been at once quelled by the Turks.

(At this point it was suggested that the question now was as to whether the Georgians would fight if stiffened by British or Allied troops.)

Lord Curzon then gave an account of an interview he had had that morning with ?. Tseretelli. He had not shown himself at all boastful about the military qualities of the Georgians. He had stated that it was their desire to build up a national State. Although advanced Socialists, they were totally opposed to the Bolshevists. He had said that they would fight whether with or without assistance, and that the present Government were bound to put up a defence of the Caucasus against the Bolshevists. He had stated that their first need was not arms, but food. His view was that if the Caucasian States resisted, the Bolshevists would not attack, and that they would be atle to come to terms with the Bolshevists. If some effective resistance could be put up, the  Bolshevists, in ?, Tseretelli&apos;s view, would have no object in attacking.

Field-Marshal Wilson pointed out that the line must in any case include the Caspian. So much had been admitted by the Azerbaijanians. Otherwise the position would be turned. His considered opinion was that this involved two Divisions of Western troops in the Caucasus, and a third in reserve at Constantinople. That afternoon he had seen Marshal Foch, who had told him that if any Frenchman ordered a single battalion to the Caucasus he would at once be repudiated by the French people. The more he thought the matter over, the more he was convinced that two Divisions were an absolute minimum. He did not think that the Caucasians would render such assistance. They had actually handed over Batum to the Turks without any fight at all.


&amp;? Churchill pointed out that they would probably beattaoked by the Turks from the rear.   Enver Pasha, who had lately bean In Pe-lin and had made advances to the British,was now stated to have flown back to Turkey by aeroplaneand to be raising trouble there.Field-Marshal Wilson, in reply to the prine Minister,said that on the following day Marshal Pooh would absolutelyout any operations in tha Caucasus, and he himself, forthe reasons he had given, felt bound to support him. Heoeuld not advise action with less than two Divisions, and itwas impossible for us to find that foroe. He had no precise information as to the line the Italian mlllta *y authorities would take.The Prime Minister then asked Admiral Lord Heattywhether he was prepared to send 1*^00 Naval ranks and ratingsto the Caspian unless the communications from Batua to Bakuwere securely held.Lord Beatty replied *iiop certainly not&quot;.The Prime  Sinister pointed out that that ruled out(b)*and (el of *he three points he had mentioned for deoi-sion, but it did not -uile out (a).Mr Churchill expressed the view that without (b) and(e), that is to cay. Allied assistance and the holding ofthe Caspian, the Caucasian States would go ove^ to the bolshevists.The Prime Minister -thought that the mountaineers werenot likely to take to Bolshevism.   That might occur inBaku and Batum. .Sir Churchill point d out that the control of the caspian **&apos;ae ah essential element in our whole position in central Asia,   Once the command of the Caspian was goneit could o-orMbly not be reeovced for years.   Its losswould lay open to the Bolshevists not only Worth Persia butthe Caucasus and the count-y to the South, and would open-7-
up a fresh and direct line from Russia towards Afghanistan. In his view it was absurd to deal with only one aspect of this question. Marshal Foch, whom he had only spoken to on the subject today for the first time, had spontaneously uttered precisely the same idea. The idea of "unity of command", of which the Prime minister had been so warm a supporter, was as true now as in regard to Russia as it had been two years ago on the Western Front. The policy of whether we were to have peace or war with the Bolsheviks was one for the Governments to settle. It might perhaps be the right course to make peace. M. Nitti apparently believed so.If this was so, this policy ought to be taken up by those who believed in it. The Allies should either declare a peace policy or a war policy. What was neither one policy nor the other was to allow all the forces opposed to Bolshevism to go down in turn one after the other, and in the end perhaps to have to make a disastrous peace.    In order to realise what might happen, it was only necessary to recall what had happened to Germany. Once her  armies had been broken and she had given in, she had had to make a complete surrender.   At present we were losing both the war game and the peace game. The first thing to decide was as to what our policy was to be. If we decided we could not fight, it was better to make peace. In reply to the Prime Minister, who asked what his proposal was, he said that the Government should decide whether it was to be war or peace. In any case, however, it was essential to place the military direction in the control of one man.  In his opinion we could not do better than follow the precedent of 1918 an place Marshal Foch at the head of a Military Committee which should be authorised to communicate with Finland, the Baltic States, Poland, General Denikin (who was still holding up half the Bolshevist Army) and the Japanese.

The Prime Minister asked what instructions it was proposed, under this scheme, to give  to Marshal Foch. In 1918
Marshal Foch had had clear instructions that he was to do all he could to destroy Germany, and the Powers had promised to him every gun and every ship that they had. The difficulty now was to know what instructions to give him as to the amount of support he was to receive.

 Mr Churchill said he would divide the subject into two groups: the first one being one on which he believed all were agreed, and the second one in which opinions might differ. The first branch of the question was that of his defensive instructions. The whole line of defence against the Bolshevists should be placed in his control. He was reminded by Marshal Wilson that the French were not interested in the Southern part of the defensive forces. What they were interested in was the line from Finland to Odessa. This front should be defended as a whole. He was not suggesting at the moment that the Allies should contemplate any advance into  Russia, and when he spoke of "the Allies" he ?eamt Great Britain and France, and not Italy, which was not specially concerned. Marshal Foch&apos;s organisation would constitute a great Military Staff for studying the question, and it would arrange that all the states from Finland to the Black Sea should stand together. It was probable that an attack would take place in the Spring, and this was a practical consideration. His proposal was that the Inter-Allied Committee, with a great General who, in his view, should be Marshal Foch, should arrange for the defensive ensures  to be taken in hand. They should present a unified front.  The Bolshevists would then discover ? that if they crossed the line in one place to attack the Poles, they would find themselves attacked by Finland. Marshal Foch would become, as it were a Great Constable of Europe.

 Lord Curzon said that that was what he meant by the "chain" policy.

 Mr Churchill, continuing, said that the French took very little interest in the South. That they feared was
that the Bolsheviste would upset Poland, whom they oountedon as a valuable counter to German aggression.    They did notwind very much if the British Empire in the East was troubledby what happened in.South Russia.   ffe might, however, make ita condition of our agreeing in a unified front on the west of Russia that the French should give some help in the South.As Pa-t of the general plan he contemplated it might benecessary to hold the Caspian, but the question must not beconsidered piecemeal, and it was perfectly useless to hold the Caspian in order to stave off the Bolshevist menace fora time.   Be himself had asked Marshal Foch if he ignoredthe situation in other theatres than the Western Front ofRussia, and he had replied &quot;Ho? the situation was as criticalas it was at the tire of the First Battle of Ypree, when hehad had to put into the battle.the soldiers who looxed afterthe latrinee.   If this plan were adopted it might give us the means to compel the Bolshevists to accept a peace that dinot look like a surrender.   He wanted fi-st to set up theCommittee he had proposed, with harshal Foch as President,to look after the defence of the Western and Southern Fronts,construing the term &quot;defence&quot; in the widest manner, and toprelate the operations of all the different fo-ces under this commission.   The second man on the Commission should lankmore particularly after the Southern Front, and should be aBritish representative.   He asked his colleagues to look atthe question from the noint of view of whether what hevrould term &quot;Leninism&quot; should be -iven a chance or shouldbesmashed at once.    In any case the first step was to set upthe Commission with full force \nd authority.The Prime minister stated that such a body had al-ready b^en set ap.   A decision had been taken in London, endconfirmed in Paris, to continue the military organisationat Versailles, with Marshal Foch at its head.   All that wasnecessary was to rive it a definite reference to take thisquestion in hand.   The decision, however-r, really depended
en whether we were willing to give full suppor?to^e6Tstlte3encirallncr ^lssia o- not.Lord Curzon suggested that such a body would &quot;equire aBritish Military Representative of very great standing and authority.Mr Chu-&quot;chill said that fo- &quot;england the Chief of theImperial General Staff clearly would ha-&apos;e to be there when allthe   re at decisions were taken.     Re could have a pe-manentrepresentative the-e, ae at present.The Prime Miniate- pointed out, that Field-Ma-shal Wilsonalways had been present when great decisions were taken,Mr Long pointed out that M-* Churchill&apos;s proposals we-ereally in two parts, . One part was the action he proposed totake through the lilitary Commission, and the other was theaction to be taken later on the Caspian.   The difficulty was,however, that in dealing with the Caspian time was an easen-iial consideration.   Action was required immediately if itwas to be. taken at all.   He had been stud vine the evidence onthis .;uatter very closely during the last few weeks, and hehad come deliberately to the conclusion that the danger toour Eastern Empire was greater than it had ever been before.If we did not take immediate steps we might in the nearfuture be fighting desperately for the retention of ourKaste-n Empire.   He did not unde-stand from Field-MarshalWilson whether hie objections to holding the Caucasus were due to lack of troops o- whether he did not take the same view as the Admiralty, that the holding of the Caspian was essential.    If the Field-Marshal said that he agreed in thebutpolicy suggested by the Admiralty,, ija had no men available,that raised a different question.   In his view the industrial situation at home celled for.a larger Army,   The situationin Asia gave opportunity *o obtain this...   If, because oflack of men, nothing could be done, it would be better toatlake peace ri^ht away..   It had been suggested^the cabinet itself that the Navy had abandoned the Caspian.   This,howeverwas not .*he case.   If it could be said in the Cabinet itself,
the same thing would be said outside, and this was very unjust. At the present time it was possible to recover control of the Caspian, but later on this would no longer be possible. He asked that Lord Beatty might now be heard.

Lord Beatty said that he would like to add an additional danger to those that had already been mentioned as involved in the loss of control of the Caspian. This was a Naval strategical question. During the last five years our command of fuel and particularly of coal, was one of the factors which had helped us to control the seas. This power was passing, owing to the fact that oil was rapidly taking the place of coal. Not only was the mercantile marine using oil as its fuel to an increasing degree, but the Navy was now dependent to the extent of 75 per cent, on oil supplies which were not under British control. He believed that at the moment he was correct in stating that only 4 per cent, of the oil output of the world was under British control, although if the proposed agreement with the French were signed this percentage would be considerably increased. It was very important to the Navy that this control should not be in foreign hands. Of course the output of the United States of America was entirely in American hands. The Americans could also at any moment control the Mexican Eagle supplies, and owing to its geographical position the same applied to Trinidad.  The other sources of supply which we could control were ? small. One of the problems of the Naval War Staff had been to ascertain where oil was to be found which could be obtained without control by other Powers. Of these source it was found that Persian oil was by far the most important In Persia there were great oilfields not as yet tapped, which experts believed were more extensive than those in existence elsewhere. To hold the Caspian meant that these  oilfields would be relatively easily defended. From the commercial point of view it was most important to hold them?
If as the Secretary of State for War had suggested, it might be desired to re-capture the Caspian in the face of opposition, this might prove well-high impossible. At the present moment tome was a very important factor. If no decision were reached  within three days ? he believed it would not be possible to hold the Caspian. A good deal had to be done. Among other things, General Denikin&apos;s consent had to be obtained. (Mr Churchill observed that there was no difficulty about this.) The representatives of the Azerbaijan had informed him that they would agree to hand over their ships. We should have to put ourselves in a position to repair them, and they would have to be got into condition for use not later than March 10th., when the ice would melt on the Volga. If no decision were taken within these days he repeated it would be impossible to affect this.

  
THE PRIME MINISTER asked the Chief of the Imperial General Staff whether, If he were a Bolshevist General and the country north of Baku was held by mountain tribes, and the British Navy held the Caspian, would he be able to march his army on Baku and keep his communications open?

FIELD MARSHAL WILSON stated that this depended upon the value of the Azerbaij ians. In his experience, however, and he had had three years&apos; experience of mountain warfare on the frontiers of China, a mountain range was about the weakest line to hold.

LORD CURZON pointed out that the question would depend largely on the attitude of Daghestan. An appeal had been made for the recognition of the Armenian Government as a de facto Government, and he thought that the question of recognising Daghestan ought also to be considered.

FIELD MARSHAL WILSON said he was given to understand that there were a great many places where the Caucasus range could be crossed. If the Bolshevists were only opposed by the forces of the Azerbaijan, he thought that they would have no difficulty in marching through.

MR CHURCHILL pointed out that if General Denikin could maintain his front the communications between Batum and Baku would be secured.

THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that it would, at any rate, take the Bolshevists some time to force the Caucasus. Before they could menace Baku and its communications the Navy would have time to slip out.

FIELD MARSHAL WILSON said it would not be wise to risk 1,200 British sailors on the Caspian then their lines of communication were only held by Azerbaij ians and Georgians. Even if he himself were ordered to send troops to the Caucasus it would take him a long time. In reply to Mr. Long he said they could not be sent from Constantinople as this would denude that district.

  

   
THE PRIME MINISTER said that in any event to send 3 divisions of British troops was out of the question. If Marshal Foch was unable to send a battalion it was no use talking of sending western troops to hold the line of the Caucasus. No one present had suggested for a moment that the British could send 3 divisions.

 MR SONAR LAW pointed out that if we made up it a condition of our support elsewhere it was possible the French might change their attitude.

 MR CHURCHILL said it might be assumed that the Italians would send no one.

 FIELD MARSHAL WILSON pointed out that the French could not even obtain troops for Syria.

 LORD CURZON pointed out that all the Powers were interested to some extent in the Caucasus owing to the Oil at Baku. No doubt it was of greater interest to us than anyone else, owing to our position in the East. If command of the Ca?ian were lost we might find that before long our whole Eastern Empire was rocking, but if we could dominate the Caspian it might alter the whole situation in the East. Otherwise, we were in a worse position than we had seen any time since the beginning of the war. The Bolshevists, seeing that we were weak, would overrun Khorassan and Northern Persia, the Caucasus and ?rmenia.

 MR MONTAGU agreed, but asked whether, from the point of view of India, it was not also necessary to hold the lines east of the Caspian in order to secure the support of the Afghans.
he stated that he would not himself choose that line for the defence of India.

 MR CHURCHILL pointed out that for the defence of India it was probable that we should merely attack elsewhere, for example, from Finland and Poland.

 THE PRIME MINISTER agreed. If he were convinced that the Bolshevists were contemplating a great military expedition against India, he could see no object in holding the line that had been suggested. He recalled the meeting of the Industrial Unrest Committee which had been held a few days ago, and from which he gathered that there were not enough troops for maintaining order at note. In these circumstances, it was absolutely out of the question to send 3 divisions for the defence of the Caucasus unless the French would cooperate effectively. Assuming that a great military expedition were undertaken by the Bolshevists against Azerbaijan, their object would be the oil at Baku. He could not understand why they should go beyond this. They would be entering Armenia, a miserable country which no one was willing to accept responsibility for. It might be said they would go to Cilicia, but this was without any great wealth, though he had heard of one valuable copper mine. Barbarians did not march after nothing. When Napoleon had invaded Italy he had admitted that he went into these rich plains in search of food. It was suggested that the Bolshevists would overrun Poland. If they did they would come up against Germany. Another suggestion was they would go into Hungary. The latest reports showed that the Hungarians were as badly off as anyone.

 LORD CURZON pointed out that one aim of the Bolshevists was the cotton of Central Asia.

 THE PRIME MINISTER replied that this was not to be found in India. So far the Bolshevists had nowhere attacked the allies except by means of propaganda. This was quite a legitimate

        
method of making var* but the railitary methods would not ore-vent thi-.. a    11 was true that in the United states of i.merloamill tary&apos; me tfcods had in .. sense been adopted,  that ie to say,the rounding up &amp;nd banishment of the Bolshevists.    In Lussia,hoveveri the milltary opposition to the bolsheviets had onlyended in failure.    Its only result had been to oret te amongthe  jolcheviste what 7.-S no &apos; the most formidable po ;er in theworld, -inoe all trie other armieu jere demobilised.V.II OUUIvOHILL pointed out that the military o.oosi ti on tothe ool:;.-hevists had been very haig-hearted..,:hlir&apos; ..YUM::7Z3. said that it -fould always be hall-hearted.Lien v/ould not volunteer to give cheir lives merely to opposeBolshevism.   He did not believe th*t tny troops oould ae ob-tained except from airland, and 3 divisions from  ,agland was out of the question,   -ranee was not sufficiently interested inthe Caucasus,   He believed Marshal ^och ;:ms speaking the per-feet truth then he said they would no &apos;o send one battalioii.

If   Smiral .ie;. tty could t; ke the naval risk he .&apos;ould be&quot; procured&apos; to ti. ie tae   -olitieal risic.   ke did hot&apos; -VISE,
however, to press admiral Beatty for an immediate reply if he would rather think it over carefully. If this could be done he would be prepared to send war material to the Caucasus and to supply them with food for their armies. There was, he admitted, the risk of the arms and ammunition falling into the hands of the Bolshevists, but the Bolshevists had captured so much British material that a little more would not make much difference.

 MR CHURCHILL expressed the view that the material they had captured was not of much value now.

 THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was not as though we were handing over something to the Bolshevists that they had not yet had. As regards Mr. Churchill&apos;s proposals for a united command under Marshal Foch, he expressed the view that this depended entirely upon the instructions given to the Council. This Council was already in existence, the only question to decide was as to whether this particular question should be referred to it for study.

 MR CHURCHILL observed that much more than a study has required. It was necessary that it should be given a definite command.

 MR BO? recalled that M. Pat? the Polish Foreign Minister, had suggested the same plan as Mr. Churchill, namely, the coordination of the whole front from the Baltic to the Black Sea, but had combined with a suggestion that a line should be drawn which the Bolshevists should be informed must not be crossed. He did not see, however, how this could be done when the whole of ? was in a state of civil war.

 THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that ? had drawn an armistice line.

 MR CHURCHILL pointed out that this was a first-rate arrangement from the point of view of the Bolshevists. It meant that the ? were absolutely passive until the Bolshevists were prepared to deal with them. That was one of the reasons why he advocated the establishment of a single organisation for studying the whole policy on this front.
 THE PRIME MINISTER said there was no evidence that the Bolshevists meant to attack the Baltic States, and there was some evidence that they would be willing to recognise the Caucasian States, and the same applied to the Poles.

 MR CHURCHILL suggested this was only temporary.

 THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that everything depended on the instructions given to the Council. If it was merely to study the question he had no objection -- (MR CHURCHILL pointed out this was no use) -- but if Marshal Boch was to be able to order General Haller or General Munnerheim to attack, that involved supporting them for offensive purposes. General Judenich had said that he had not been given enough support. Exactly the same was being said by General Denikin whom we had helped to a very material extent. He believed that General Holman was sending telegrams to the effect that the people round General Denikin were claiming that they had been betrayed by the British. Whenever they were beaten these people would say that. It was no use undertaking responsibilities which we were unable to support. The Italians would do nothing, and the French, to use an Americanism, would "pass the buck" to us.

 MR CHURCHILL said the Prime Minister&apos;s point of view seemed to be that the Bolshevists were not to be feared.

 THE PRIME MINISTER said that the danger of Bolshevism was not military but political.

 MR CHURCHILL said it was beginning to become military.

 THE PRIME MINISTER said we could make the danger a military one, just as had happened in the French Revolution. He thought it was possible to equip the nations of the Caucasus so as to make the Bolshevists think that it would be better to make terms with them than to attack them. As regards the Poles. We should say the same to them as we had said to the Esthonians, namely, that if they would not make peace the responsibility was theirs.

 MR CHURCHILL pointed out that in the main this was what was being done.
 THE PRIME MINISTER contested this. As Lord Curzon had pointed out, the Allies had undertaken a great gamble in Russia. They had wrestled with the Bolshevists for command of Russia and had failed. Up to now most of our strength had been put into this. The suggested policy now was to say: We leave the internal situation of Russia alone, but if the Bolshevists attack Esthonia, or Poland, or the Caucasus, they will be resisted.

 MR CHURCHILL asked that the situation would be if Lenin felt that he could only maintain his strength and his position by continuing to attack these States. Has it not a thousand pities to have the present fronts broken up?

 THE PRIME MINISTER said that on the assumption that General Denikin and Admiral Koltchak were broken up, which he agreed with Mr. Churchill was a horrible thing, involving, as it did, the slaughter of many of the best elements in Russia, there would be no further resistance throughout Russia. Mr. Churchill then suggested that Lenin, flushed with military victory, would begin to constitute himself a new military power in Europe and would begin by attacking Poland and Esthonia.

 MR LONG pointed out that when Poland was attacked, according to Field Marshal Wilson, we should have no soldiers to send to her support.

 THE PRIME MINISTER said that a Frenchman today had told him that although the French would not send troops merely to keep the Bolshevists out of Minsk or Dvinsk, they would find plenty of troops to send to Poland to resist an attack on the dependence of that country.

 MR LONG said that in his belief if it were announced that there was a menace to our Eastern Empire, sufficient troops could be obtained in Great Britain to meet it, and at the same time any serious danger at home would be provided against. We had learned for the first time this week that the army was inefficient owing to the youth and inexperience of the troops, and at the same time thousands of seasoned and trained men were trooping the streets.
 MR CHURCHILL said that the whole of the Prime Minister&apos;s argument led to our making peace. This was not a policy that he himself, having in view his attitude on this question, could accept at the present time, but, nevertheless, it was a policy that ought to be faced by those who believed in it.

 THE PRIME MINISTER said that Mr. Churchill was driving his argument too far.

 MR CHURCHILL said it was better to face it than to ignore it. At present events were just being allowed to take their course.

 LORD CURZON again raised the question as to the maximum which could be done on the Caspian within our narrow limits. At present there was a garrison of a brigade at Batum. The First Sea Lord had proposed to hold the Caspian -- (ADMIRAL BEATTY interpolated "Provided the line from Batum to Baku was held") -- Supposing the lines of communications were only held by native forces, but 2 battalions were sent from Batum to Baku. Assuming that the worst happened and that the Bolshevists threatened Baku, was it out of the question, he asked, for the Navy to fall back on Enzoli?

 THE PRIME MINISTER said he did not wish to press Admiral Beatty to give an answer before the following day if he did not wish.

 ADMIRAL BEATTY said he had already carefully considered this question, and to fall back on Enzoli was not a practicable proposition. It would not be possible to put to sea with a force possibly inferior to the enemy in strength and with the ships loaded up with troops. That was why the Admiralty asked that Baku should be defended from the sea, as well as from the land. Then if need be the fleet on the Caspian could retire to/it before a possibly superior naval force. The enemy had, as a matter of fact, the means of putting a superior naval force on the Caspian.
 LORD CURZON asked in that event what was the use Of trying to hold the Caspian?

 ADMIRAL BEATTY claimed that the Navy might be sufficiently strong to prevent movements of troops across the Caspian.

 THE PRIME MINISTER said he had some recollection that on a previous occasion our forces had retired from Baku to Enzoli.

 LORD CURZON said this was the case.

 MR L0NG pointed out that at that time the Bolshevists did not command the whole length of the Volga.

 ADMIRAL BEATTY said that the Bolshevist ships consisted of destroyers, whereas the British ships would consist only of armed merchant vessels. The Bolshevists had 3 destroyers below and 4 above Tzaritzin, and they might be able to put two or three more on to the Caspian. If we could put two or three submarines on to the Caspian we might command it sufficiently to prevent large military troop movements across it although submarines were not a good type of vessel for fighting destroyers.

 THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that the Bolshevists were very poor sailors.

 MR CHURCHILL asked what the conclusion of the discussion was?

 THE PRIME MINISTER said we were not prepared to send two or three divisions. We were prepared to help clothe and equip the Caucasian States, to resist the Bolshevists. Admiral Beatty advised that he could not recommend the dispatch of British sailors to the Caspian unless the lines of communication were securely held. This seemed to be the position.

 ? MARSHAL WILS0N added that the Caucasian line could not be held unless the Caspian was held.

 MR CHURCHILL, asked what his suggestion would be, said the Finns, the ? States, the Poles, the Serbs and Bulgarians, both of whom were willing to help, the Roumanians, in fact, all the forces in that part of the world, should be coordinated under Marshal ?. This was the only alternative to making
peace and making some attempt to induce Lenin to show mercy to these Border States. We could adopt either one course or the other. For a whole year we had seen one friend after another pulled down. Peace would be better than this. It was absurd to do nothing, and what was being proposed in the Caucasus and the Caspian was like using a piece of putty to stop an earthquake. General Denikin had had an army of 250,000, and Admiral Ecltchak 500,000, and these had now gone down. The Bolshevist enemy now had a force which the ? Powers had not yet felt, but which all the small countries on the fringe of Russia which had been seeking their own interests so assiduously would now begin to feel. Whether we wanted peace or war we ought to establish some sort of a front.

 LORD CURZON asked whether, on the following day, the question of recognising the Armenian State should not be raised?

 THE PRIME MINISTER said he was under the impression it had already been agreed to.

 ADMIRAL BEATTY said it was quite clear that the Caspian could not be held without the 2 divisions in the Caucasus.

 MR CHURCHILL suggested that the Caspian could be held if General Denikin still held.

 ADMIRAL BEATTY said that in that event General Denikin could hold the Caspian himself.

 MR CHURCHILL said that General Denikin had expressed the greatest regret when the Navy had been withdrawn.

 LORD BIRKENHEAD, asked for his views, said that we were in a position to send food and arms, beyond this he could suggest nothing. The only other proposal that had been made was that of the First Lord, namely, that the whole of the facts should be stated in Parliament and extra troops raised.
PROPOSED EVACUATION OF BATUM.

(5) MR CHURCHILL said that if the Caspian was not to be held he must make a formal request for the garrison of Batum to be withdrawn. It was needed elsewhere and if it was left where it was it might before long be forced to retire in ignominious circumstances as the French had been forced to retire from Odessa.

 FIELD MARSHAL WILSON supported this request.

 LORD CURZON begged that it should not be withdrarm at present.

THE INDUSTRIAL SITUATION IN GREAT BRITAIN.

(6) THE PRIME MINISTER asked Sir Robert Horne to report on the industrial situation at home.

 SIR ROBERT HORNE said that what might be termed the Bolshevist forces in Great Britain were very active but not very numerous. They gathered inspiration from Bolshevist military successes in Russia. They were conducting a very large number of meetings especially in Glasgow. They had now definite plans which they intended to put in operation whenever a serious disturbance should occur. They were particularly lively to take action in the event of a strike of the coalminers, especially if they were joined by the transport workers. They were working hardest among unemployed ex-soldiers, and that element would join the Extremists, and he had reason to believe they were, to some extent, being provided with arms and hand grenades which were imported into Glasgow from Ireland. He had been in touch with some of the people inside this movement which had been going on for weeks. The plan of the miners was to take the country when it was at its weakest, that is to say, in March, when it was believed the army would be at its lowest. They were working in close association with the Cooperative Movement, which had asked to be allowed to collect stores for the purpose of a strike. The Transport Workers were at present asking for 6s. a day on a 8-hours day. At present they only worked 47 hours a week and apart from overtime were earning roughly 12s. a day. Even Lord Devonport, who was usually willing to resist, thought that the situation was one in which a court of inquiry was required.
Lord Shaw of Dunfermline, thanks to Lord Birkenhead&apos;s assent, had agreed to act as Chairman. He thought that Bob Williams, the Transport Workers&apos; Leader, was probably asking for this inquiry in order to get his organisation to strike for 16s. a day simultaneously with the coal strike. He understood that the plan was to keep some of the men at work in order to supply the Cooperative Stores, and to control distribution from these. Supplies would only be issued to persons who had vouchers. Complete financial supplies had been organised through the Cooperative Bank. The whole organisation was better than it had been before, and a good deal had been learned from the railway strike. The Transport Workers were also working to get control of petrol. The Government&apos;s transport system had been largely disorganised and depleted, and it would take time to get the lorries together again.

 THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that the Defence of the Realm Act would still be in existence in March and lorries could be commandeered.

 SIR ROBERT HORNE pointed out that one of the anxious features in the situation was that the available military forces were very small and could not keep order unless the Constabulary were enormously increased. Unfortunately, the Special Constabulary scheme had almost broken down.

 THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that it could not be worked up again without an alarmist speech. It would be for the Cabinet to decide whether this was desirable. He believed that if some statement were made the men could be obtained. It would be necessary, however, to state the evidence.

 SIR ROBERT HORNE pointed out that the Government would then be accused of being provocative. What he had urged at a meeting of the supply and Transport Committee was that the Home Office should try and obtain the men through the Constabulary.
 THE PRIME MINISTER said he was sure the men could not be obtained without a statement of the situation such as Sir Robert Forme had made. It would be necessary to appeal for Special Constables. Dock Labourers, Drivers, Co. It would then be said that the Government were forming a strike-breaking organisation, and challenging the whole Trades Union movement without that. What, he asked, could be done?

 MR LONG said his solution, as he had already indicated, was more troops. This, at any race, would make things safe in Scotland. Sir Eric Goddes had expressed the view that the ? tremists would begin with sabotage from the very first.

 SIR ROBERT said that the railwy strike had taken everyone, including even the Extremists, by surprise. This time, however, it was thought that the Revolutionists would not at once. However, they were only a small force.

 (There was some discussion at this point as to the attitude of Smillie and Hodges).

THE PLEBISCITARY ?. (7) MR CHURCHILL said that he specifically and formally recommended that the 11 battalions  should not be sent to the plebiscitary areas.

 THE PRIME MINISTER said this was not a decision only for the British Government. One or other of the Ministers would have to tell ? Clemonceau on the following day. This would be a movement against peace.

 MR ? thought it would be a very serious step to take, and he would first like to see the figures as to the  number of troops in Great Britain.

 ? WILSON agreed that if there were enough troops in England these battalions ought to be sent, but the  difficulty was there were not enough. Apart from the weakening of the allied forces in the plebiscitary ?, an announcement tnat we could not send these battalions would lower our prestige.

 LE ? pointed out that the failure to send these batalions would become public knowledge and would have the effect


 of the alarmist statement which Sir Robert Horne required to obtain in the Special Constables.

 LORD CUEZON said that the effect in ? and in Germany would be ?. We might let our Allies know that in certain eventualities we might have to recall there battalions.

 THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that he should tell Mr Clemene? privately that serious trouble in England was anticipated and that we might have to keep these battalions at home.

 FIELD MARSHAL WILSON pointed out that some advance parties had gone already and some of the battalions were due to start almost at once.

 MR LONG pointed out that the retention of these battalions could not be Kept secret. If it became known that they were retained owing to the serious situation at home it would create a great sensation.

 FIELD MARSHAL WILSON asked that it might be placed on record that if and when 11 battalions have gone to the plebiscite areas, 7 to the china, 5 to India, and 5 to Egypt, only 38 battalions would be left at home, of which 8 were Guards battalions. These battalions had a ration strength of only 600 men, and consisted entirely of young end inexperienced troops. In his opinion, they rould be almost useless in the event of trouble at home.

 MR CHURCHILL pointed out that there would be only 2 battalions in Scotland. In the last strike 8 had been required in Glasgow, and 8 in Liverpool, and these were not sufficient.

 THE PRIME MINISTER said that before taking a decision he would like to have full particulars as to the number of troops we were now paying for in the United Kingdom. In accordance with custom, the matter ought to be considered by the Cabinet on the basis of a document containing full details. He would therefore, ask the Chief of the Imperial General Staff to supply such a document.
