(This Document is the Property of HiH gritMa.1 estv1 s Government, -\annicSECRET-THE COAL STRIKE.NOTES of a CONVERSATION held at 10,&apos; Downing Street    S W 1on SUNDAY, OCTOBER 24,  1920,  at ll&apos;a,m. ^reet, s-^.l,PRESENT:FOR TEE GOVERNMENT.The Prime Minister.Mr Bonar Law.Sir Robert Horne.Mr Bridgeman,The Coal Controller.Sir Maurice Hankey.FOR THE MINERS&apos;  FEDERATION.Mr Smillie.Mr Frank Hodges.Mr Robson.Mr Herbert Smith.(At the outset it was agreed that the Conversation shouldbe purely informal and that no official record should bekept.    Consequently, no notes, whether stenographic orother, were kept, and the following brief note is frommemory only.)THE PRIME MINISTER began by explaining the origin of thepresent meeting.    Conversations had taken place during theprevious week between representatives of the Government andMr Brace and Mr Hartshorn.    These had.been of an informalcharacter.    He had felt, however,  that, as the miners federation had been summoned to London, the government ought to take advantage of the opportunity to see whether-1- &apos;
the results of the conversations with Mr Brace could leadto a settlement of the present strike.    No-one really wanted the strike - least of all the principals;    that is to say,the mine owners, the miners, and the Government.    Hence,if possible,  some means should be found to bring it to anend.    THE PRIME MINISTER then continued to sum up the impressions of the Government,  following the conversations with Mr Brace.    These are contained in a document which was communicated at the end of the meeting by the Prime Ministerto the representatives of the Miners&apos;&apos; Federation and whichis attached in Appendix I.    After describing these proposals,THE PRIME MINISTER said that the point on which the Govern-ment laid stress was that if the advance of 2/- a shiftwere made at once and the output on which it was based wasnot realised, the reduction of either the whole 2/- or a proportionate part thereof, according to the actual outputobtained, should be automatic.    Unless the Miners&apos;  Federa-tion could accept this, the scheme would be impossible towork.   When the day came for the reduction to be made, itwould be contended that the causes of the reduced outputwere beyond the control of the miners themselves.    Gonse-guently the Government insisted strongly that the re due tionmust be automatic in order to avoid any possibility of controversy.THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE MINERS&apos;  FEDERATION were unani-mous in regard to the.extreme difficulty of their acceptingan automatic reduction in the event of the output not beingrealised.&apos; They pointed out that as .a matter of fact output was often determined by circumstances wholly beyond thecontrol of the miners themselves.   Unless tubs, trucks,and all accessories were provided, it was impossible for theminers to make a great increase in output.    By closing a
single shaft a mine-owner could often prevent a particular-mine from increasing its output.    They laid the utmoststress on the fact that under this  scheme the miners had togive guarantees for output, whereas no similar guaranteeswere exacted from the mine-owners.THE PRIME MINISTER AND HIS COLLEAGUES,  in reply to  this,pointed out that under the scheme the miners were obtaining the great boon of an immediate rise of 2/- a day.&apos;   If theyfailed to achieve the production for which this 2/- a daywas expressly designed, they were asked to sacrifice thewhole or part of.the increase.    The mine-owners, on theother hand, were not obtaining any benefit.    It would,  conse-quently, be very difficult to ask them to give any corresponding guarantees, since those would come not out of increasedprofits arising from the present arrangement, but from, theexisting pro fits,which were limited by previous agreements.Great stress was laid on the fact that under this scheme the miners would in fact receive their 2/- a day, and it waspointed out that in every probability,, and according to MrSmillie&apos;s owi   admissions,  they would be able to achieve theoutput necessary to retain the 2/- from November onwards.THE REPRESENTATIVES OP THE MINERS FEDERATION explainedthat as the datum line scheme had been rejected by theminers themselves,  it was very difficult for them to go backto the miners with any scheme based on output.After somewhat prolonged discussion, the representativesof the Government produced the alternative scheme inAppendix II. providing for an immediate advance of 2/-,and its retention unless profits failed to reach an agreedlevel:    that is to say, the retention of the 2/- was to bebased on a continuance of profits, and not on an increase -in output.
THE REPRESENTATIVES OP THE MINERS&apos;  FEDERATION, while ex-pressing a preference for any scheme which avoided output,said that they could not go to their Executive on the subject-until they had received further details as to the level of profits required for the retention of the 2/-.THE PRIME MINISTER said that this had not yet beenexplored by the representatives of the Government, and he proposed an adjournment for this purpose.It was suggested that, before the meetings were resumed,it might be an advantage for the Coal Controller to have a preliminary talk with Mr Hodges on the question of figures,when his investigations were completed.In conclusion, Mr SMILLIE pressed very strongly that neither side in these Conversations should try to obtainany advantage over the other side.This was generally agreed to.It was also agreed that there should be no Press reportof the meetings at this stage.The Meeting adjourned at 1 p.m.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,October 24, 1920.
APPENDIX      I-.1.    The Mining Association and the Miners&apos;  Federation shall:a. Co-operate to the fullest extent to obtain increased output and for this purpose will arrange to set upDistrict Committees and a National Committee.b. Proceed forthwith to prepare a. scheme for submission tothe Government for the subsequent regulation of wagesadvances in the industry having regard among other considerations to the profits of the industryand to theprinciples upon which the surplus profits of the industry^ir-tt-C^/are to be di?s*M%^%ed. between the producers (including-employers and workmen), the consumers and the State.2.    Pending the preparation of such a scheme as is&apos; referred toin 1 (b), wages shall be regulated on the following basis:-a. An advance of 2/- a day to persons of 18 and over,     Ashilling to persons of 16 and 17, and 9d, to persons under 16 will be paid from the date of resumption ofwork to the classes of colliery workers entitled toSankey wage and subject to the conditions under whichSankey wage is payable.b. Provided that if at the end of November the output hasnot reached the agreed figure a reduction will be madeautomatically on a scale to be agreed upon now, and isimilarly if in any following month the output falls ^below the agreed figure, the wage shall be adjusted forthe succeeding month according to the same arrangement.APPENDIX     II.Alternatively that the 2/- sbmild be given now, and thatit- should be retained unless the profits failed to reach a level to be agreed upon, and if they shouldAot reach that figure the 2/- to be automatically reduced according to a scale to be agreed upon now.
