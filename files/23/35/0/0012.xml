SEC.BE T.NOTE OF A CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE PRIME MINISTERAND Iff. NITTI ON SUNDAY,  JANUARY 18, 1920, ATCLARIDCE&apos;S HO TEL, gARIS.M. Nitti, accompanied by M. Trombetti and a young Ital-ian officer, had breakfast this morning with the Prime Min-ister, Mr. Bonar Law, Sir Maurice Hankey, and towardstheend Lord Birkenhead being also present.M. Nitti came . to discuss the general European policyof the Allies.    He began by saying that the whole situationwa,s in his opinion fundamentally changed by M. Clemenceau1 sfailure to secure election as President of the Republic. he described this as a cataclysm.    His interpretation of M.Clemenceau1s failure was that there is a radical change inthe French point of view.    He believes that in French estima-tion M. Glemeneeau represents the war spirit in the minds ofthe French people, and that France has had enough of the warspirit and wants to get back to peaceful conditions. Acccrd-ing to his view France at heart rejects the &quot;barbed wire&quot;policy towards Russia, and is now less antagonistic to the bolshevists.    He said that he had reason to believe thatthis was in the minds of a good many ^Deputies.M. Nitti then proceeded to comment on the present trend of the policy of the Allies and its effect on the European \situation.    First he said that the general hostility towardsthe Bolshevists, and more particularly the &quot;barbed wire&quot; pol- .icy, not only brought the governments of the Y/estern nationsinte active conflict with the Bolshevists, but also alienated &apos;all the Revolutionary elements,which are at present pery ac-tive in all parts of Europe, and tended to drive the Socialists,who sympathise with the Bolshevists to some extent, towards themore revolutionary wing of Socialism.    Next he turned to those
Articles of the Treaty of Peace with Germany which deal with the Kaiser and these guilty of breaches of the laws of war. Regarding the Kaiser he said he would make no comment, as this was a settled question. He did observe, however, that in his defense the Kaiser would insist on dragging out the archives of every Government, and would prolong the trial. What he alluded to more particularly was the trial of the criminals. He pointed out that the accused persons consist almost entirely of officers who belong to the Conservative Party in Germany, with whom there is a certain amount of sympathy among the Conservatives of some other countries. By too drastic an application of the provisions of the Peace Treaty, therefore, the Governments would alienate conservative opinion in Germany and possibly, to some extent, in other countries. Finally, by driving the Kaliph from Constantinople the Allies would antagonise the whole of Mohammedan opinion throughout the world.

 Summing up his general thesis, therefore, M. Nitti said that the present trend of Allied policy was to  alienate first the Bolshevists, and, with them, the Revolutionaries and the Socialists generally; second, the Conservative in Germany, and, to some extent, elsewhere; and, finally, the whole Mohammedan world. The conversation then came into further details.

 As regards Russian policy. M. Nitti laid great insistence on the mistake it would be to encourage Poland and Roumania in ant active policy of hostility towards the Bolshevists unless we were prepared to give them material support. Otherwise, the only effect^of this policy would be to bring the Bolshevists in full force upon Poland and Roumania, who would be unable to resist them. In this connection he observed that there is already a Bolshevist movement In Bessarabia. So far as Italy is concerned, he said there was no question of sending any


&apos;During the- discussion Mr. Sonar Law asked&quot; M. Kitti . whether the-idea would commend itself to him of drawing a line on the map,and letting the Bolshevists know  that,  provided they did not passit we should not fight them. M. Nitti replied that this fitted in very well with his ideas. a -j fi. 11 0-roopa to fight against the 3olshevio*Hw ooxsnevists.    Tne people simolyweuld not stand it..He then developed in greater detail his Ideas about the trial of those guilty of effe&amp;oes against the laws of war.   he emphasised the great difficulty which the Corm&amp;n Governmentwould have in handing over any considerable number of of f i--oers, since this would antagonise the whole of the Militaryand Conservative elements In Germany and reader the positionof the Government extremely difficult.   There was a very longdiscussion on this question, in which the Lord Chancel lor tookpartsr and it is hot possible from memory to reconstruct the so-quenoe of arguments.   M. .Hittl*s proposal was that the CarmanSovemment should be ^iven the opportunity of trying the of-fenders themselves.-   Out.of this suggestion arose a proposal that, without giving up any of their rights under the Treatyof-Peace9 the Allies might give the Sermaas a chance of trying-the criminals themselves.   They would, however,/have to givea definite undertaking that the trials would, be genuine, sad itwould&apos; be british.mt.e&amp; to them that- if at any stage it became ap-parent that this was not the case and that the trials were asham, the Allies reserved the right - to insist on the fulfil- .ment of the Treaty of Peace, and the delivery of the criminalsfor trial.    It was pointed out that this might lead to the es-cape of. the accused before they could be brought before an allied court, but, it was recalled, that M. Clemenceau had ox-pressed the view that.in any case a large number would escape.Many, it was thought, would take service with the Bolshevistsrather than face a trial.   Another suggestion was that thereshould be a most drastic curtailment of the number of prisoners to bo demanded.   It was suggested that in order to vindicate&apos;the moral law of the world 30 or 40 trials would be ample.   It-was recalled, however, that opinion in  ranee m&amp; very &quot;bitteron. this point, and it might be particularly difficult for aW v- ...      ^ ^ .   ,. -  . ,.. j^rfti

It would be a matter for subsequent consideration as to whether some relaxation on the lines in-dicated might not be- advisable.Possibly, however, a hintmight be given to the. Germans either by the British or Ital-ians that a proposal of this kind would, receive consideration.During &quot;the above conversation the Prime Minister handed to M. Nitti a copy of a document, dated the 25th March, 1919,which, he had on that date handed to M. Clemenceau, PresidentWilson and M. Orlando.    This document contained suggestions as to the general lines of the Treaty of Peaoe with Germany,&apos;aand tended to show that in many respects the views which Mr.Lloyd George had then- held, and which he&apos; still held, were not so very different from those adumbrated by M. Nitti.
