Montagu, I.P.His Highness the Aga KhanMr, -13 .M-.H . 3&quot; .M. ChotaniDr. M.A. Ansari.Mr.       Hasan Imam.Shaikh M.H. Kidwai,MR, HABM^ niAll.   My friends have asked me- to be their spokesmanon this occasion.   But before I present our cabe, I wiiih toesqpresB, on &quot;behalf of my colleagues and rayaeli&apos;, our thanks forgiving us this opportunity of placing the views of the peopleof   India on the matter about which there is ahsolute unanimityof views among the various sections of the Indian people.    Motonly do the Munsalmans of India&apos; feel intensely on this questionof the Turkish Settlement but the same views are held by their non-Muslim brethren.    The moderate, the extremist, the Hindu,the Sikh, the larsi and the Christian are all united in thedemand that the settlement in the Hear East will he made on principles of justice and in full accordance with the pledges  &apos;given to the prople of India by responsible Ministers of theBritish Empire as well as those of the Allied and associated powers.Our chief concern is the Khilaf&amp;t.   The Khalifa, should bein a position to defend and safeguard the honour of Islam.We feel that complete independence of the Sultan-Khalifa with
full sovereign righto of the Turkish people over TurkishTurkey together with complete financial^ economic, militaryand naval freedom, are absolutely essential for the main-tenance of the institution of the  hilafat.   Indians whoare themselves striving for s^ara^f. are not opposed to national autonomy in the non-Turkish portions of theOttoman Empire but they insist that the religious suzeraintyof the Sultan-Khalifa should be maintained *   Mussulmans alsofeel that there should be no ncn-Muslirs control of any kindever the Arabic-speaking portions of the Ottoman a.-pi -ewhXokx comprise the sacred lands and the holy places of Islam.. X propose to lay before - you our case in two parts;one regarding Turkish Turkey and the other regarding theArabic-speaking parts of Turkey.    Mow, Sir, 1 begin withthe Treaty of Sevres.    The Treaty, of Sevres is regarded by indians generally and by Kahommedstns in particular ascruellv hard and unjust.    I advisedly use the -word * unjust *,though it is a wor&amp; which 1 would much rather not use,because it is a statement of the fact, in regard to theimpression and the views of the people -of India,    It isregarded as enslaving a people who have been not withouthonour in the past and.whose.excellent qualities certainlycan be appreciated upon acquaintance with them..   The terri-torial, military, naval, and the financial clauses arcwidely known in India.    It may be. that, every individualIndian does not know the details of. those clauses -MR.. HQHTACfll.   Forgive me interrupting hut 1 know you are anxious not to take up too much time-.   Supposing you tellus what you object to in the territorial, mi I its. rev, noval$nd financial clauses *   If you let the Prim&amp; Ministerknow your case, you can develop the details afterwards.gJCPOS KIK13TBIU   I have no doubt that Bekir Sattsi Beywould not mind boing kept waiting if he knew the reason.O -
&quot;but&apos; you can hardly explain it to Mra.IfK .BA3AH IMAM.   As regards these clauses,-what India)wants is the fulfilment of a pledge.   Before -1 pass tothe territorial clauses 1 wish to express on behalf ofthe people ef India that the pledge that was given tous in January 1918 by you,- Sir, should be, in itsintegrity, fulfilled to us, and in this connection I want to make one further submission, that we the IndianHahemraedans who are here to-day representing Indiagenerally, as well as the Indian Mshommadans, are nothere as suppliants for favour * we are -here before youas persons who have had a share in the achievement of victory.FHXjg.-^IffijIia^^laL  Yea, that is so, and a very largeachievement.   As far as numbers are concerned the prepon-derant share.BH.u E&amp;BAH^ IMAM.   If it is not impertinent to make such a claim as this, we are eo-victors with you, and we aresharers to the fullest degree in the credit that victorybrings to the victors.   Therefore I am not here on behalfOf the people of Turkey, I ma here on behalf of the peopleof Isdda to demand that which was promised to us, to demand the fulfilment of that assurance upon the basis ofwhich we gave you our men, we gave you our money, and. whatIs more, not money and men alone, but we gave, your ourblessing.   That, is hew we look at it.   &amp;ow I wish toshow to you that the Treaty of Sevres does not fUlffilthe pledge.   The territorial clauses affect particular-lariy Thrace; therefore I shall tales Thrace first.PRBIS t Mli-II --^QSH,.,,   Bo you put fhrac-e first and principally?
3%EU XMMl.   So far as tha Turk in hi a homeland isconcerned -1 take Thrace first.   In January 1918, the assurance given to us was on the basis -PBIMB ItlSHSTER.   I know the Quotation and thou?-h I wishto hear all you have to say, it will save time if you donot repeat it.I:0d.i HASAIf XMMT..   How Thrace is predominantly Turkish in population and Thrace is a necessity for Gonat antinop 1 eiXf Thrace is given away Constantino pie will stand ri^hton the frontier&apos;from where another country begins,    XfThrace is made over to another country the unwisdom of having a capital right on the frontier of a kingdom isma nix eat.    Thin between the Turks sand thii Greeks there isno love lost.   The fact has got to he acknowledged;traditionally they have bean bad friends and Constantinoplewill stand exposed to attack from the Greeks,.   Theretention of Constantinople for the Sultan, may fulfil the sentiment that we, the Mahemme&amp;ans, hs?..ve, hut whatis given to the Sultan is a&amp;ain taken away from him.   1submit he has got to have supreme temporal authority,unrestrained by outside control; according to the termsof the Treaty of Sevres he cannot have that.   The dailyprovisions for the city of Constantinople come fromThrace.   The population-is Mahommedan and the necessityrfor Turkey   to have Thrace is so great that if you takeThrace away from Turkey and make it over to the Greeks,the Indian Mohozamedans will feel that Constantinople (ofcourse the Tusks will fool it much more than any one else),&apos;&quot;but the Indian Mahommed&amp;ns will feel, and India generally -will feel, that Constantinople has boon given to theTurks only-&quot; for the satisfaction /* 4 h
or a sentiment but left, and cruelly left, to the mercy of the greeks * I nay tell you, Sir, that I do not wish - to be veryemphatic in sty words, but 1 want you to belieye me that we arevery emphatic in feeling on this Question, that Constantinopleif left to the Sultan without Thrace will practically not havebeen left to the Turks at all. 1^ir^MXHj^BR.   Bekir  ami Bey preferred being in Angora to being in Constantinople wider those conditions;   that is why-it is doubtful about the wisdom of Constantinople being retained by the Turks,     I do not think it worth.Turkey*a while.    Itis a very mixed population.   It may be Turkish but not predom-inantly Turkish.     It Is predominantly non-Turkish in populationI do not say it is Greek but it is non-Turkish.     There areArmenians, there are Greeks*   It is a very cosmopolitan popula-tion.     You cannot say it Is Turkish in the s&amp;nee that Paris isFrench or Berlin is German or London, In - spite of the fact thatit is very cosmopolitan, Is Kngllsfc.H.H.THE AOA KBAff.   It is the capital -Of Islam,PRIES MINISTER,      well, the capital of Islam is where theEhilafat is*     It was Brouseaj   it was Koalas   I am not certainit was not Angora.     It is where the Khll&amp;fat happens to be andBekir Sami Bey is by no mesas certain that he wants Constanti-nople for the -Ifoung Turks *    they  prefer to be in the centre oftheir own people and for that reason X have not been In favourof retaining Constantinople for- the Turks because I thought it[weakened them and did not strengthen them.     The difficulty,p.f I :may say so, is this.     The population just outside Constan-Mnople is predominantly Greek *   It is true when you get further
up towards Adrianople it is fairly equal, but Eastern Thrace ispredominantly Greek.     If there is a Mahommedan majority, it is rather in Western Thrace, about which there is very little dls-pute.     It is one of those &quot;baffling problems that completelydownbreak /every form of argument that you ever advance.MR. 1IASAM IMAM.   From, the figures that X have received throughthe favour of some friends the total population of Thrace is1,155.^000, of which the Greek population is only 300,000*     Inany carte the view of the Indian Mahommedan is this, that we neverbelieved that Constantinople and Thrace would be taken away fromthe Turks.     To us Constantinople means a great deal because! oursentiments are there.     For 500 years we have been there.     lehave looked towards Constantinople.     After we have finished ourprayer towards the Viest, towards Mecca, &amp;&amp; we do in the East, wehave to think of Constantinople as the centre from which theinfluences of Islam are to radiate because that is the temporalcapital of Islam, and&apos; we do not want to lose it*I would submit this, that whatever arrangementthe Powers may make in regard to Thrace, 1 think 1 may say thatthe MahO-iamedan view all over the world, and certainly in India,the llahommedan view and the Indian view, but the Mohammedan inparticular, is that we can never reconcile ourselves to the ideaof Thrace being made over to the Greeks and if 1 may be permitted to say so, if our own Government, the British Government, says,we will leave you to do whatever you like with the Greeks 5settle your own differences with thera, I can give you this asaur-ance that every man in India will contribute whatever he possessestowards securing to the Turks a place in Thrace that will never be lost to them through any aggression on the part of the Greeks.
PRIME MINISTER.

Does that mean that if we settle about Thrace you will not regard the Treaty of Sevres as being a satisfactory, or just one?

H.H. THE AGA KHAN.

With Thrace Greek, certainly not.

PRIME MINISTER.

And your second point is - I would, rather, subject to whatever the Secretary of state for India has to say, I would rather Mr. Imam had gone on on the line he had started and developed the financial, military and naval clauses. I can understand the sentiment about Thrace and Smyrna, but it would be very helpful to me if Mr. Imam would give me a summary of the objections to the financial, military and naval clauses. Those are rather the things that we canalter; the others are much more dificult, but it would be very helpful to me to go to the Conference this morning with a knowledge of the objections which are entertained to the financial, military and naval clauses as Interfering with the independence and dignity of the Ehilafat.

Mr. HASAN IMAM.

If I may be permitted to say so you, Sir, have put the subject very happily in words In which I could not have expressed the idea &apos;the dignity&apos;.

PRIME MINISTER.

I can see that Is a very essential point and I should like to know what the real objections are. That would be very helpful/


to me when I get into conference with my colleagues of the great Allied Powers. I would like to know the points of objection at the present moment. We will have further talks on the subject but I now I should like to know these points.

MR. HASAN IMAM.

Article 232 reads :-

"The budget shall be submitted first to the Financial Commission and shall be presented to Parliament in the form to be approved by that Commission. No modification introduced by Parliament shall be operative without the approval of the Financial Commission."

What is the use of presentation before Parliament at all ? As it strikes me the presentation of the budget to Parliament would really mean a formal passing of the budget through Parliament.

PRIME MINISTER.

I agree so much with you that I wish it were possible for the Turks to put their case about this. They have never really put it to us. It is true We are meeting them, but they never present their case on this subject.

SHAIKH M.H. KIDWAI.

If I may respectfully say so, if any modification does take place in reducing the severity of the conditions, that will not meet the case. It must be independence real and true.

H.H.THE AGA KHAN.

Financially as a debtor nation she may allow creditors to have certain things like Brazil and Portugal.

PRIME MINISTER.

Turkey has never said anything-in this way. I do not know what they want though they have been here some time. That is why I want the Turks to present their case.

SHAIKH M.H. KIDWAI.

Islamics one and indivisible, and any question affecting its status can be discussed equally by Indian, Turk or any other Muslim people.

PRIME MINISTER.

Its voice is not; its tongue here is Turkish. The Turk can wield his sword but he is not effective with his tongue; he is perfectly hopeless. I wish this case could be put and I wish Bekir Sami Bey would tell us exactly what it is he


wants In regard to this.    He pill Una much more sympathy about it than he will about the other.    Shore are great difficulties&apos;in regard to the others for clivers Reasons.   The Greeks have occupied those territories;    they are there and it is verydifficult, to get troops out of a place if they do not want to go.H.K,*THE AGAm KHAIf ... If the great lowers will leave us alone,  we will raise the troops very easily.PHIMID MIfllSTSR.  If you could localise the conflict and let theTurks and tho Greeks fight it out it w.ould not matter so much.The real danger is that Islam will bach one party and theChristians will back the other and that would be fatal for thepeace of the world.    If it aas fought out there I would not mind;the Turk can fight well if he cannot talk and 1 would ratherleave it to them to fight It out.E.H.THB A Chi KBAB, And you will not lot us go in ?PB 1MB Ml MIST 253*  It would be fatal.MR. Jl&amp;SfK IMAjSf. Bave it neutralised then together with WesternThrace.    But to allow the Creak to be there is asking for fight-Ing and keeping Islam in a permanent state of unrest.    I can Beeno peace.    If you take away Thrace and Constantinople it looksas though your policy is to check Islam and the people willthink that is the policy.    If you neutralise it, then therewill be no danger to Constantinople.   Lot every man who livesthere, Sreefc,  Jew, Christian or Mahommedan have an equal vote and let there he a Muslim Governor elected by the League ofMat Ions,MR. BOB AS I A. . The experience of the League of Hat Ions has nop \been happy.MR. HASAH IMAM. But the experience of Creek over Turk has been h- - . \disastrous. &quot;\SHAIKH M.H. IP AI. If Thrace is given to Greece it will meanextinction of Muslim rule in Europe and we in India will thinkthat the old policy of turning out Islam &quot;bag and baggage&quot; is
 being executed.

PRIME MINISTER. There are Mahommedans in Serbia and in Bulgaria, in Bosnia and Herzegovinia. Islam has powerful representation throughout the Balkans although you have not got Turkish rule.

H.H. THE AGA KHAN. Bosnia, as long as she was under Austria, was under a great Power: it was like being under British rule. Now they have the pretence of being a great Power; they are different.

PRIME MINISTER. The Bulgarians treat them well inside Bulgaria.

K.H. THE AGA KHAN. They never give them anything. They have no rights. They cannot become officers or enter the Civil Service: they are only there on sufferance and the result is that 300,000 have gone to Turkey out of a population of 800,000.

MR. BONAR LAW. In time you will have the Russians coming to Constantinople neutralising any Greek influence. 

PRIME MINISTER. Will you do this for me. Will you give me a paper on Article 232. First of all your criticism on it; then your suggestions for its amendment.

I will put to you the difficulties which are presented to me whenever I urge this case with which I have great sympathy. It is said that the Turks borrowed a good deal of money upon certain undertakings with regard to customs and the management of their finance - nothing to do with the war, but prior to the outbreak of war - upon the strength of that the French presented them with money. It is chiefly French since they found 70% and the 30% was found by the British. Therefore they say you must have a certain control of finance because it it part of a bargain.


MR. &apos;EfoSAil.: mi&amp;..     It is a mortggge.PRIMS MINISTER, It is a mortgage with trustees ami conditions,personally I am in favour of foregoing everything about repsra-tions and claims during the war.      It is no use and will onlybe a constant source of worry.      so long as it is simplyconditions which existed before the war, it was a bargainbetween the Turics and the bond-holder, and I do not see thatthe Turk has a right to complain.      Brazil has accepted that and so has Greece.     We prevented Greece the other day fromissuing a cortaih number of drachmas because We were responsible for the bond-holders.      Here therefore there is nothing that derogates from their independence.      80 long asit conforms to that, you will find that so far as GreatBritain is concerned, we are quite willing to forego any sort of claims that have arisen out of the war and we are willingto let bygones be bygones , or to use our own phrase * cut theloss1  and Impose ho conditions in this respect upon Turkey.We propose to increase their naval and military forces, thatwe have already done and I think on the whole they will be fairly satisfied with that.      Our difficulty is aboutconscription.     - You see we have forbidden conscription toGermany and to Austria.    Austria is of no account;    Germany is.And if we forbid conscription to Germany, it is very difficultto extend it to turkey.      The Germans will say sooner or later,not just yet perhaps but later on, we are not going to accepta condition which you would not impose on Turkey which was just as much your enemy in the war.      They will insist onhaving conscription and Europe eould not face another greatconscript army in Germany.      Therefore we must insist on it.We have no conscription here so we are only imposing acondition which we impose on our own people here without exception.        We are quite willing to meet the Turks but Ireally do not Know what they want about finance.
9 9 Q-11.11. THS /.C.a KJiAB..        The stajjug quo a ate bellum.1^431;Li &apos;.&apos;!-R* I think with properr pressure you will getthat.     You (I say have a little trouble in some directions butI cannot imagine why they could not be worked but it has neverboon as^ed for so far.MR. HASAS IMAM. Conscription may be forbidden but how canyou safeguard the dignity of the Sultan as an independentsovereign when there are Commissions of officers of otherQ;Q:unt.r.ie;s going about ana ferret ting- into what Turkey is doingand opening rip chances of intrigue for as many Powers aspossible.      These Commissions of Control should be removed.;PRIMS MliHSTHUi. You will help the Turks very much if youwill make their case intelligible to the supreme Council.    Theyhave not done it up to the present, but if you concentrated on financial and other controls that is hhex-e you can possiblyobtain great advantages, but we must know what is wanted and it-is no use Bekir sami Bey going back.to Angora and then returninghere and saying we do not like this and we do not like the other.He must let us know what he really wants.    If you.will kindlylet me have a memorandum criticising the controls.    Tho case ofThrace and amyrna he put fairly well because he had the wisdomto employ a lawyer who presented his case for him.    He presented a very able statistical ease for both Smyrna and Thrace, but when you come to the others he has presented no case of any kind.If you could help him to present his case I should be very glad.I would rather&apos; know exactly what his case is about control and what he wants done.H.i:I. THE AC A We may on behalf of the Indian Mahommedanspresent a case because our justification is  that the Khilafatmust be .strong and independent.Liii. BQJIAH 1A\7. .     It should not be presented to the supreme council in a joint form.PRIMS lfI8ISTSK. It is to help the Turks present their case.iLR. HAS AH IMAM. We present the case to our own Government;to our own Prime Minister.PfiDIB idillSTEH- If you will kindly let me have an
analysis of the controls;    in what respects you say theyderogate from the dignity of the Ehilafat and therefore areobnoxious to tha whole world of Islam;    that is a thing whichwill carry very great weight coming from India and especially from those who have been so very loyal to the Empire in a timeof very great difficulty and who have a right to speak becausethe victory is largely theirs;    therefore I should be glad of your memorandum as soon as possible.    I do not know whenBekir S3 ami Bey will return but I think he will probably leavehis Delegation here and will return to Angora.      When, he gets-there he is dealing with people who have only a generalobjection to things but have no clear idea of what they want.It is very fortunate that they handed over their case to Mr.Imam and I believe we shall get a really satisfactory- Treaty.LIB., HASAH IMAM- I wi 11 write the memorandum to-night and let you have it by Monday morning.(The proceedings then terminated).
