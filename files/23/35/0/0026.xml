NOTES of a- Meeting held at 10 downing street on 0ctober&quot;27th,  1920,  at 12 noon.P R E S E N T:The Prime Minister.Mr. Bonar Daw..Sir Robert Home.Mr . Br id pern an .Sir David Shackleton;.Mr. Duncan (Coal Controller)Sir Maurice Hankey.Mr. Tom Jones,Members of the Executive of the Miners&apos;Federation,  with Mr. Smillie as Chairman.THE PRIME MINISTER:    Wehave had a. Conference which haslasted one hour and three-quarters with the Mine owners and we have explained to them the various stages of thenegotiations and the proposals which emerged from ourvarious discussions.    The last stage of our discussionwhen you adjourned-was at the point as to whether-weshould fix the wages as from the 11th December or whether as you suggested, we should take the five weeks.which &apos;included the last fortnight of November and the first three weeks of December,as a determining factor for themonth of January, and the output for January similarlyas determining the advance for the succeeding four weeks,and so on in each succeeding month.   We have given agood deal of consideration to that difference and we felt
that although it, ?fss very Important and that It might involve a complete drain In the pool and a loss whichwe should have to make up somehow or other, we would not take the responsibility of preventing a. settlement inthe dispute merely upon that difference.    In this l^e strerelying upon two things.    First, may I say mainly upon your word of honour that you will put the whole of yourstrength In the. organisation and increase.sing output.We attach great importance to that undertaking.   we need the influence which you possess, and rightly possesswith the various large bodies of men, who look to you for guidance in their daily tasks.    We also know thatwhen you give your word you mean It,  end that insofar as human capacity permits you.will do your best to adhere faithfully to your bond.    That is how we dra?;upon the experience of the past, and that we rely verylargely upon this undertaking which you are giving us.This has influenced us to take a risk which,upon thefigures, we are not justified in taking.    We felt thatif you gave that undertaking it was a risk we are justi-fied In recommending the nation to take, depending upon your word of honour and knowing that it would be dis-charged to your country as you -have always done when-ever you have signed an undertaking.The second thing we depended upon was that ifyou failed, to secure the necessary output for one reason or another that both you and the owners , . . . . .We are drawing no distinction here.    You would not auto-matically have to abate your 2/-, but the owners would automatically abate their 10$.    They pleaded that theywere not -in quite the same position because the 10$ 
was something which was given them under the Coal Industrie?Act and there was no proposal to give them any addition now,whereas in your case you are getting an addition of 2/-,Logically, I think they were right, but I pointed out tothem two points of view of the appeal to the men that it made a very great difference where both parties were inexactly the same position, and therefore they must be pre-pared to sacrifice with logical consistency and perhapslogical justice to the presen.tm.ent of the case to the wholeof the Coalfields.   What really matters is that whateveragreement is.come to there should be cordiality and good-will and co-operation in the Coalfields between all thosewho are engaged in discharging this very important function of the industrial life of the community;  in fact the mostimportant, 1 think In. the whole mechanism of our industryand commerce.    It is right that I should say that when put that point to them although they urged that they werein a strong logical position they very readily agreed tomake that sacrifice.    I think It is is fair that that should be stated on their behalf,Now I am going to give you the document and 1think you will probably ^like to examine it carefullybecause it involves calculations which you are entitledto examine carefully to see whether they carry out themain principles which were laid down and which were accepted between us yesterday,.    This document will be handed round.    I propose that the document should begin with this preamble       &quot;Recognising that on the increased production of coal there depend not only the prosperity of all who are engaged in the Coal industry but also the welfare of the nation and the cost of life of .the people;and having In view that this urgent need can only be matif the miners and mine owners throughout the country work^
together cordially for this common purpose:    and further&apos;,having regard to the necessity of setting up machinery for regulating wages in the Coal Trade so as to get rid; of present anomalies and provide against future difficulties.The Mining Association and the Miners&apos; Federationsolemnly pledged themselves to make every effort to achieve these objects.&quot;I do not know that 1 have anything further to add..I think the best plan would be for me to hand this documentround and leave you to examine it.MR. HODGES:    How do you get the figure of  576,000 per week?SIR ROBERT HORSE:     576,000 per week is 50 weeks which whenmultiplied gives the yearly figure which ne were working onbefore, namely, 2888 millions.      The reason why we turnedit round into weeks was because taking a five week period -you could not compare it with the subsequent four weeks.Therefore, we have to get the weekly average of  576,000.The rest, I think, is simple.TEE PRIME MINISTER:    I think we had better now adjourn and&apos;if any explanation is required the Coal Controller can come-in and give you any information that is required in regardto these figures.The representatives of the Miners&apos; Federationthen deliberated amongst themselves.On resuming the Prime Minister said:    Now, Mr. Smillie,we shall be glad to hear what you have to say to us.MR. SMILLIE:    We have gone through this memorandum of your proposals and we are rather concerned, about this proposed,increase in wages above the 2/-.     It looks to us as if theminers were being asked to give a great deal at that pointin order to secure/l/- per day ^r/o/-.     We consulted Mr.
Duncan in the matter and I think we disagreed about themeaning of it.     He,thought it would be well to put it before you.     In view of the fact that we are really on both jsides - out to encourage the miners and the owners to increasethe output, we do not think that /this clause would help usbutx rather retard us.THE PRIME MINISTER:    I will tell you about that Mr. Smillie.I have two points which 1 should like to give you in answer.The first is, this is something you never asked for.      Ithink it was a proposal which we made ourselves.     Yourdemand was,a 2/- demand altogether and., therefore, it is rather our suggestion with a view to encouraging outputthan any proposal which you mades      If we had left thisout altogether we should have been dealing with your proposal and. you would not have had any right to complain.     This is something which we suggested, as. an additional encouragement to increase the output because.se we have a serious apprehensionas to the serious financial position of this- country unless we can increase the quantity of coal sent abroad.     Thereare a good, many reasons for our arrarehensions as I wastelling the owners this morning.     For instance, there is a collapse in the silver in Chinaj    there, is the failure ofthe monsoon in India.      These have had a serious effect upon the orders which are coming to this country and:,therefore, that is going to alter our financial positionand perhaps make the exchanges worse.     We should be payinghigher prices for our goods than we otherwise should, be doing and at a time when there is a fair chance of the costof living coming down on the state of the markets the pricemay be kept up merely because we have not the necessaryexports, R^
9 9 RW l-J \JTherefore, an increase in coal is a very vital necessity to the financial condition of the country, and we are putting tills in, not because you ask for it, but simplyas an additional inducement for the miners to go evenbeyond the figure we had laid down originally.     Now thatis one answer.My second point is this, we must consider what I toldyou about yesterday, and that is the pool.     I am afraidwe shall be out of pocket upon the transaction.     From themoment we guaranteed the price to you, I think we were really bargaining for a deficit, and it is just possiblewe should be bargaining for a considerable deficit, evenif you make the output,because the indications are thatthere will be a break in prices at the present moments weare quite willing if you prefer to take the risk, but Ithink you very wisely decided that you would, as it were,not gamble with the wages of the men, and you would prefer a certain 2/- to even a higher price at a lower output.    Ifwe go beyond that, and increase these rates above 246,000,000beyond what we have already done, we might lose very veryheavily, and we should have to go to the consumer and make him pay.     The 1/- as it is, is an undoubted additionalrisk for us.     We could justify it oh the ground of output,but if you were to increase ^ssss^^m^ the amount or lower thefigure, I think it would be so serious a risk that we mighthave to put a very heavy additional burden on to the con-suraer.     That we could not do.     It seems a curious thingathat you should press upon us/-fete higher wage than you askedfor.     We cannot go beyond that without running riskswithout putting a severe tax upon consumers.     Those areour answers to the queries you put to us, Mr. Smillie.MRo SMLLLIE/
MR. SMILLIEs     In one of your Clauses you say prooeedforthwith to &quot;prepare a scheme for submission to the Govern-ment at the earliest possible moment&quot;.     We anticipate beforethe time comes that it will be unnecessary to use this secondscale at all*THE PRIME MINISTER.    I hope so too, and the mine ownersare just as anxious ae you are to have a permanent basis.They would infinitely prefer having something which you candepend upon to work, not merely for weeks, but if necessaryfor- years;   but you cannot be quite sure of that, and Mr.Hodges yesterday quite frankly stated in his judgment itmight mean April.     Well, if we were running this at greatdeficiencies for November,, December, January, February, Marchand April, that would be such a heavy deficiency that the taxpayer or consumer would have to go? to the rescue.mr SMILLIE %     But you are not running at any risk,because if we do not make good you will reduce wages.THE PRIME MINISTERS    I am assuming you have made good.You must remember we are running the risk of a fall in prices which might go on very rapidly in December, and might getworse in January.     As Mr. Bonar Law put it yesterday, andMr. Smillie confirmed it, from his experience once there isa break, it goes very very rapidly.     Therefore, we might-have a deficiency, which would not merely bankrupt the fund,but which would be an enormous burden upon the Exchequer.That is I assume that you go up.     As a matter of fact fromthe point of view of the Exchequer, the worse thing for usunder those circumstances would be that you could ^r^duceyour output   - from the point of view of the Exchequer, not from the point of view of the country.MR. HARTSHORN/
MRo HARTSHORN.   Is there really any indication thatthere is likely to he a break in prices?   I am only asking for information.THE PRIME MINISTERS     The coal owners certainly expectit.     That I can see, because there is a very considerablebreak in prices in other directions*     It is hardly conceiveable that this is the only thing where there is no probability of a break.     The other is that there Is a great change in theconditions, in regard to Prance and even Italy,, because theGermans are for the first time delivering coal.     I know it from the political side.     I was constantly getting telegrams from Mo Millerand, and in the old days from M* Nitti, and afterwards Mo Giolitti, asking for coal.     M. Giolitti asked me at Lucerne when I met him there -tuii i bog for more coal, buthe does not do so any longer.     There is not the same pressure.Goal was always the cry at every conference.    &quot;Give us morecoalIw   They did not complain about the price.     They said,&quot;Give it to us&quot;I     Now I do not get any such telegrams..   that means there is a change.     They are getting some coal from america, and also the Germans are delivering coal   -   I believethey are delivering the 2 million^ tons.SIR ROBERT HORNE:     Prance has a surplus of coaloMR. HARTSHORNS     She is selling it again is she not?SIR ROBERT HORNE s     That is what the Germans say.MR. HODGESs     You saw our difficulty Mr. Prime Minister.I daresay the Coal Controller explained it to you.     It mightbe that these negotiations might be extended for a couple ofdays if we begin^ to go into the question as to what is the exact proportion that we should have after the 246,0009000 tonshalf
have been realised, provided that prices begin where theyare, I can see negotiations hanging out.     Now I do not want to say that &quot;sufficient for the day is the evil thereof&quot;,but I do/ want to put a proposition to the Government whichI think will get us away from the discussion of the propor-tions that we are to have after the 846,000,000 tons havebeen realised;   that is the proper work of the PermanentCommittee of the National Board.   Undoubtedly that is itsfunction, always with the sanction of the Government,   woulda proposition of this character that I am going to propose toyou now have your approval?     As I pointed out what we want to do is always to keep before the workmen the possibilityof them having a proper proportion of increased values, andif it could be shown to them,in fact if they could discoverunder the actual terms of this document that they would begetting less proportionately for the figure, xsx 22 securedabove 246,000,000, tittfja. they get from 238,000,000 to 246,000,000they would naturally say, &quot;we have been had&quot;.   What induce-ment is there for us to increase output above a certainAlthough we are earning the money, we are to get a lesserproportion than the money earned prior to that figure.   Thisis what occurs to my mind   - a clause like this instead ofschedules ofthose particular/figures:&quot;If the values from export estimated upon ths basisof this scheme for the month of January are in excessof the figure which warrants the continuance of the2/- per week shift advance, such excess income to bethat wasfigure if we are to get a less proportion of that output?that date the principles of the permanent scheme arenot in operation&quot;.How/
How, that would carry us out of this difficulty, and carryus forward into the period of the permanent arrangements.We only say that, in order to help us out of this veryobvious difficulty, caused by setting down figures as tocertain advances after the 24690009000 have been achieved.THE PRIME MINISTERS   You have another point I believe.Perhaps you had better put both your points then we canretire to consider them.MR. SMILILEs   One of your clauses I observe says:-(d) Similarly, on 31st January, the wage advances will be automatically adjusted, and thereafter every four weeks,on the results of the four weeks immediately following thelast preceding test period   - but the Christmas holiday weekshall not be counted in any such period.&quot;   In Scotland, atthe New Year, the holidays extend to almost a week.     I thinkthat also should be mentioned.SIR ROBERT HORNEs   We would make an allowance for that.I think to put it in this agreement m uld merely lead tocomplications.     So far as the Mines Department is concernedwe will make an appropriate allowance for the change inScotland and the north of England.MR. SMILLIE.     Then another clause reads:-     &quot;(f)    the certificate ox the secretary for Mines as to the amount ofproceeds and the amount payable shall be accepted as final&quot;.Does that mean without question?sir ROBERT HORNE:    It is purely a question of figuresyou know Mr. Smillie.MR. SMILLIE/
MR. SMIDLIE.     One of the things we complain to thePrime Minister ahout is that we are never in a positionto know how figures are arrived ate     It does not seemquite fair that we should not have access to the figures.THE PRIME MINISTER:     Are these the Customs figures?MRe DUNGAH: Our weekly figure is the only figure which would be in question* All the others are fixed.The figures would be there week by week.MR. BONAR DAWi    The only question would be the-  - - MU(JjMfc ..character and the msma&amp;eSamx and division.MR. DUNCABfs     It is merely a question of arithmeticoMR. BRACE:     If the point was raised, we simply want to be able to say   &quot;Oh yes, if there is any question at all we have the fullest liberty to approach the Ministry of mines to give the decision&quot;.11
w 4*SIR ROBERT HORNE:     If Mr0Hodges would like to see thefigures in the hooks we should he delighted for him to seethem.     We oan only go on figures we get and if you come and see them we shall he quite happy about it.     These arefigures of output.MR.HODGES;     We do not want to come to check Mr.Duncan&apos;s figures.     This is the real position.      The Controller getshis figures returned to him week by week from the pit fromthe Colliery books.     A question may arise as to whether you had the correct returns from a Colliery Company, or from   -&apos;&quot;a,number of Colliery Companies.     I hope that we should never be in that position, but would the Prime Minister give us the right, if we had occasion, to put a chartered accountanton to examine the accounts at the Colliery, or even at-pCollieries, to see if those figures were correct or not.The figures for price are fixed;    we understand that, andit is just to leave us a safeguard,as we have always had inour OonciliatCT^ Boards, that we should examine the Companies&apos;-books.MR.BONAR LAW:    In that form it would seem very invidious.MR.SMILLIE:     We had that right in the Scottish Concilia-tion Board.     We had Miners who went round.to the collieriesIwho were entitled to compare the figures.MR.DUNCAN:    If they ask the Secretary for Mines to investigate any particular figure, he will always do it.There is nothing in this. ;PRIME MINISTER:    Speaking now from the general point ofview, what I should went to avoid would be a sort of dilatory:    Ienquiry which would prevent this scheme coming into operation!:     &apos; \ , jThat is all.     If you can find any means by which you eancheck the thing as you are going along at any given point *   but if at the end of the five weeks you said &quot;Here, i must examine these figures      I doubt that colliery and this&apos;
colliery;    we must &quot;be allowed to send men down there&quot;then, you know, this does not come into operation.     Youdo not want any delay.ME.HODGES:     We do not want any deliberate delay.PRIME MINISTER:    If there are any means of checkingthe thing without delay   if you can think of any means,well and good.MR.BRIDGEMAN:   You would be in a position to call myattention to anything which you may desire and it could be examined as it occurs week by week.PRIME MINISTER:   What is the end of the third week inDecember?SIR ROBERT HORNE:    The 18th.PRIME MINISTER:   That gives a week for any process thatyou can thihk of before it comes into operation.     As amatter of fact it g&amp;ves more because the pay-day does not come to the end of the week.     It really gives a fortnightin which you can examine it.     So long as there is a process which does not prevent the scheme automatically coming intooperation on pay-day, I do not think there could be any objection to it.MR.HERBERT SMITH: It will be done in process if it causesdelay.PRIME MINISTER:     I think the best thing is for us to shesay that we will give you every facility for the checkingof the figures.SIR ROBERT HORNE:    Certainly.MRoSMILLIE:     We have no intention of raising this point for the pttrpose of retarding output.     We had in mind whatthe Scotch figures were when the cost figures of themanagement went up enormously and we had no opportunity ofsaying a word.PRIME MINISTER:      Is: there any other point which youwish to make Mr.Smillie?
MR.SMILLIE:    If we are going to settle, we want tosettle it right out at the earliest possible moment.    Everyday we sit here is postponing it.PRIME MINISTER:    That is true.HARTSHORN^:    Was it not suggested that instead oS .the indefinite term used in the early part of the proposals that we should suggest that the report should he made&apos; by the goal Owners and the Miners ?MReROBS0N:     I think it was &quot;as early as possible&quot;.MR.HODGES:     We were suggesting a date for a reporteven if not a final one.PRIME MINISTER:   You mean for the new scheme.MR.ROBSON:     Yes.     You said at the earliest possibleda te.PRIME MINISTER:    The Owners are anxious about thattoo.MR.HARTSHORN$:   Why not take the first week in January?SIR ROBERT HORNE:    The difficulty is, if you find your-self, as you will, with a good many details to discuss and you are not ready by the first week in January, it tends toproduce a hustled report and inadequate consideration of something which may be essential,MR.BRACE:     The putting in of a date helps to crystallisepoints in one!s mind.PRIME MINISTER:   You can say this - that the Owners andyourselves may be able to do it on that date, but to put it inhere is to pledge everybody to something which may turh out to be impossible and which may appear as a condition which wouldbe broken if not realised.MR.HARTSH0RNI1:    Instead of saying &quot;proceed forthwith to&apos;prepare a scheme for submission to the Government&quot;   could wenot put in words to this effect : &quot;that both parties shallreport to the Government at the earliest possible date&quot; - that
we should report to the government what progress is made,say &quot;by the end of January ?PRIME MINISTER:   We will consider that amongst other things.MR. BONAR LAW:    Is there not an objection to reportingwhilst in the middle of negotiations?PRIME MINISTER:    It would probably take you a weektheto consider what/report should be.     When the Goal Commissioniwas in progress I sent for Mr.Justice Sankey and I asked himwhether he could do it by a particular date, and he said hewould consider it, and later he said he could do so, but no-one could say that here.     As a matter of fact I know Mr.HodgesTview because he expressed it quite freely yesterday.     Is there any other point Mr.Smillie?MR.SMILLIE:   No, I think that is all.The Prime Minister and his colleagues thenretired to deliberate amongst themselves.
On resinningTHE PRIME MINISTER said there are only two- substantial points which remain.     The first is with regard to what is to happenafter the 2/- figure has been reached, and the other as towhether we -are going to put a date in for the delivery ofthe report.     I will take first of all the question of thefigure above 2/-.     Mr. Hodges put in a suggested amendmentwhich we have examined, and I will tell you what our objec-tion to It isj    it means the re-opening of negotiationsupon the provisional period.      Supposing for the sake of:&apos;V::;:!:--;,:.&apos;- 77        77: -y.-&apos;-.&apos;.&apos; 7 .77y v7   -,-7 7;7 y 7 :- - i .&apos;y v-yyy7-. . 7.:7/&apos;:   y y&apos;,       .. 7yy       -7- ;;-&apos;.y-..- -   ;: y7. 7-&apos; y. - yyy 7\ 7;.77-7 7 7-: -7,.-;.y-&apos;...........7 &apos;.i /-7/argument you get up to your 250 millions or 252 millions, orwhatever the figure Is which would entitle you under ourscheme to your extra 6d. - at any rate you have exceededyour 246 millions.     Then comes a fresh demand:    thenfollows negotiations where the price of coal will be involved and all sorts of other questions.      In fact more or less thesame sort of issue as we have been discussing, and that at aperiod when I should have thought you would have been devotingall your negotiating capacity5-beca11.se we know by bitterexperience that is very great! - to getting round the ownersin the way you have got round us I      In your own interestswe should have thought it was a mistake for you. to devoteyour energies in that way.     You want, and everybody wants,in fact you have been pressing for an Immediate settlementof the permanent basis.    -What you would be doing then wouldbe that you would be fighting for 6d. here, whereas youought to be settling the permanent basis with the owners?^You do not want that and it is only a provisional period;It is a question of 2, 3, 4 or 5 months - 5 is the period, put up by Mr. Hod.ges.      There is no time here for a secondnegotiation--to use Redvers Buller&apos;s phrase to be &quot;spatchaS -cocked&quot; into the middle of a big negotiation of the whole thingWhat really matters is that so far as this provisional period is concerned, the thing should work automatically.     Therefore,
you should devote your energies with the&apos; owners to preparethis great scheme for putting the industry on a permanent basis satisfactory to all1.&apos;.      That is ou^ feeling withregard to that.     Therefore, we would infinitely prefer that you should settle that point now.     You know thefigures  are not as indefensible as they appear to Mr. Hodges,We worked them out.     Would you mind, distributing- this document?     You will find, that it is a scale which works on very defens       principles. ^1^288,000 or over, l/6;    yougo up another 288,000, that gives you another 6d$    you go up another 283,000, that gives you a further 6d. which makes 2/6;   you go up another 288,000, that gives youanother Gd. which makes o/-s     Each stage goes up by theasame figure so, therefore, it is/perfectly logical system which you can defend..      I think It is better that you shouldsettle it now than that you should leave it during a provisional period to another agitation and another seriesof negotiations which will simply Imperil the positionwithout achieving any result.     With regard to the date,we have some feeling about that.      It is no use puttingdown a date there which has no meaning.      There is no manhere, and. there was no man amongst the owners who .could saythat a scheme could be prepared in the first week ofJanuary.      It would, be put In merely for controversialpurposes.      Now that is a thing that you can defend..      Ifthere were any hope - if there were a justifiable hope -that by the first week In January you had your schemeready th^h you wotyfe. have put that date In, but simply tosay you must put it in there in order that you may reportto the Government the stage of the proceedings - well, Ido not think that is much use.     hook at the proceedingswe/had during the last few days;    I could not report&apos; duringthe last two days what the position was nor could you,certainly not without damaging the/success.     There,jwsL        Mil)
were trying this and trying that way out.     You might have reported that we were doing our best, but nobody could reportexactly what the state of the proceedings was without eachgiving away his own particular position, and possiblyreporting something which would have no reference to thefinal decision when it cameo      If you do not report reality.It is no. use reporting sham.      It is no use saying &apos;we arevery sorry we have not come to an agreement&apos;, that is no use0Therefore&apos;, there is no point in it except one which I thinkis a misleading one and which I think would obviate a littletrouble for you at the present moment, but which would create trouble later on..    It is essential from our point ofview, there should be an automatic scheme *     We do not wantany discussions about it until you come to/the final thing.You are simply leading your1 men to expect a report say, onthe 2nd January.     Well&apos;, what is the good of mkking an alteration,     You would be merely creating trouble foryourselves by the Insertion of a misleading date.      It is much better that the men should come face to face with the knowled.gethat they are getting the 2/-;    they may get 3/-, that depends upon their co-operation with the owners.      The same thingapplies to the owners as to whether- they get the whole ofthe 10/s - that depends upon whether they will give you bonafide assistance In increasing the output and Improving theconditions.      If you put a d.ate of that sort everybody willtreat this thing as if it were of no account at all.     Therewill be no real exertion and the object which we have in viev/and which the nation expects us to have in view of having a real inducement for the owners and for the miners to putforward exertions immediately in order to save the situation will be thrown away completely.      Now that is our very definiteview upon those two points.     I d.o not knox? whether you wouldlike to consider them.
MR. SMILLIE:   We are of opinion&apos; that if you w ish to securethe greatest possible output and if you do not look upon us as experts;    if you know better than we do ---------
THE PRIME MINISTER:    I have really never put myself forward as an experts    I have always apologised when I have discussedfigures with you that I do not know the trade, and I amonly just picking it up as I go along, doing my &quot;best to try to secure conciliation and agreement between ourselves.MR. SMILLIE:    If we are to endeavour to increase the outputwe believe we should stand a better chance without thosefigures.   If you say &quot;No&quot;, well, alright.THE PRIME MINISTER:    I am not arguing about those figuresgoing inj that is not the points    I am arguing againstreopening the thing in the form as suggested by^Hodges.It was never put td.me that the figures should be taken outaltogether.MR. SMILLIE:! hope that we shall be in a position to reach the output which wotild justify any such thought as this.It is very doiibtful if in that period we shall be able toreach that output, but it is our business to do our best and we are giving you the best idea of the way to set about it.    I am perfectly sure of this, that reading the paperpresented to us this morning the men would not be encouraged to increase the output above 246 million.SIR ROBERT HORNE:   We have made an improvement in our previous figures, Mr. Smillie.   We previously offered 3/-for 256 million.   We now offer 3/- for 254 million, andwhereas we offered 2/6d. for 245 million we now offered2/6d. for 250 million.MR. ROBSON:    That is not the point.   You have put in a document which, ensures 2/- for a certdin output, but itis no use our going before a conference of men and have totell them that they have to tuen out  twice the number of ...
tons for a l/-.SIR ROBERT HORNE:    That is not true.MR. ROBSON:    I am trying to put before you what are theviews of our Conference.   &apos; For a certain number of tons theyget 2/-, but when you get in the higher regions they have toproduce the same number of tons for l/-.     You could, not accept that that was proportionately right.SIR ROBERT HORNE:    If you say to your people *you have gotl/- for 238 millions which is 2 million tons less than previously proposed and you get 2/- for 246 millions-------MR. ROBSON:    If you go to a Conference and talk of 246million tons there would, be difficulty.     You. must keepaway from that.SIR ROBERT HORNE:    That is why we are trying to put themforward as values.MR. HODGES:    If we did not understand the document I could,quite appreciate our accepting Sir Robert&apos;s reasoning, but wequite see after all that we should have to earn every pennyof this;    that if we did not earn it it would, come off;we propose to earn it, we want to earn it, and we want to earn more;    but the document you have put before us at this moment indicates to us that when we want to earn more weshall receive less.     We are putting it to the PrimeMinister in all seriousness;   we want him to help us and Tiewant him to help us for the very purpose which he has inview, and that is the desire to get more output.     Now we put it to him --    it does run a risk of opening negotiationsa.gain in January;    it runs the risk of some dispute between ourselves and the owners,THE PRIMS MINISTER:    Of a provisional thing - that is what I
am talking about&apos;.MR. HODGES:    Is it too much$L to think Mr. Prime minister that when we get to that stage the owners and ourselveswill have arrived at such a conception of how the futureshould be run, if we have not got the scheme ready, wecould get over, with your approval the temporary difficulty.THE PRIME.MINISTER:    I want you to bear in mind, Mr, Hodges,   jthat there  are difficulties on both sides.     There  are menwho take very extreme views amongst the owners just as there are amongst your friends and they will have difficulties with those men If you start re-opening negotiations.     Forthe moment we have secured their consent to this.      It isnot an easy matter but we have done it upon trie scheme asa whole&apos;.      Just see what this means If we go back on thisnow.     What Is the first thing I shall have to do.      Ihave got their consent upon the scheme as a whole with difficulty.     There are some very powerful men who were opposed, to it.     Now the first thing I shall have to do would be to summon the owners again.
Take that from the point of view of what Mr. Smillie wassaying a moment ago, as to the importance of having this set-tied one way or another; I might get them to agree, or I mightnot; hut there we begin again.    They will say: wWellp you put this scheme as a whole before us, now you are going back upon it.&apos;f I was under the impression that the one issue between us, as Mr. Bonar Law points out, was the issue of the five weeks, which was a very serious issue.    It was one upon whichat one time we thought we should have to break.   We came tothe conclusion if that was the only issue, as I told Mr. Smil-lie yesterday, we should not be&apos; justified in breaking upon that whatever the results.    I told the owners that this morn-ing by way of inducing them to agree to the thing as a whole,and I should have to go back   to them again and begin negotiations-ations with them, and that is re-opening the whole of the thing again after, as I thought, every point had been closedexcept that one point, which is a very important point, aboutthe 5 weeks   putting off the testing time until January in-stead of taking it from December.    Our first proposal, as you know, was to take it at the 4th December.    Well, we have giv-en away the whole of that to you,because I faaocs put it to Mr.Smillie:- &quot;-Bfes^^W mean you will recommend it to your Exe-the whole of that thing again.    That puts us in a very greatdifficulty.MR HARTSHORN: Now these proposals are drafted you are giving 250 million datum line for 2s.THE PRIME MINISTER: Oh, no.    That is the first time thatI have heard that.MR HARTSHORN: We get nothing beyond the 250 millions.THE PRIME MINISTER: You get 2s. for 246 millions.MR HODGES: If we get a ton short of 246 millions we getless than 2s.executive?&quot;and we understood you said: &quot;Yes.it now it reopens
THE PRIME MINISTER:    That is so on a scale unless yougo up to the actual figure, or unless you scale it downin ounces and pennyweights.MR.SMI1LIE:   We have to try to carry our men and wewould prefer that those should he left out.   I am afraid itwill not reach the stage when we shall have to use this secondlot of figures.   We only discussed the Es. before, but thosefigures beyond the 2s. stage were put before us today for thefirst time.MR.BONAR LAW:    I thought it was on the assumption thatthe scale should continue on the same basis.MR.SMILLIE:    The Prime Minister said on Sunday thatthere may be increases in wages above this 2s. which would be quite true, but to go to the men with those figures it wouldmake it very very difficult.   I do not think it will reach250 millions this year, and it might perfectly well be leftout altogether.SIR ROBERT HORNE:   Mr.Hodges&apos; document provided for anexcess of increase above what you first mentioned.MR.HODGES:   We asked for 4d. for every  400,000.MR.ROBBON:    Supposing the miners said they would ratherhave it out.THE PRIME MINISTER:    Then I should have to go to theowners again;   I must deal fairly with them.MR.B0NAR LAW:    We must have some basis which leaves noroom for discussion.MR.H0DGES:    The trouble is this;    we proposed in ourdraft that just as you required 8 million tons to give you 288,000 in one period, we really propose, in the nest 8millions, that is up to the 254 million tons,, that we shouldalso have 8 million tons for a further advance of 2s.     we did suggest there was a basis, but we are now so wideapart that if we begin to talk about it now and argue.
to try to come to the right proportions, I am sure that these negotiations would go on for another couple of days.THE PRIME MINISTER: In any event they would go on.    Ishould have to go hack to the owners; I do not know whatanswer they would give, and we should have to reconsideragain.    They were the proposals I put before the Cabinet last night.&apos; I then summoned the coal owners this morning and theyhave accepted them as a whole.    Certainly they did not likethem.    Now it is proposed to tear them up and to leave out a very vital part of them.    The owners must he consulted inthis just as well as the men, and we shall have to go back. Ithink you had better consider this upon the figures which wehave given and then perhaps you will let us know.SIR ROBERT HORNE: Really what you are asking now is bet-ter and more favourable to you than what you asked at theend of your negotiations with the.coal owners.    Then you ask-ed 4s. for 256 millions, now you are asking for 254 millions.SXE MR HARTSHORN: These proposals are extremely difficultto defend before a Conference.    When we have to recommend themen to increase output, provided we get 246 million tons we receive 2s. but the miner will get no more if you get247,248, or 249, but still you want them to go on, and when you have got to 250 millions you will give them half the amountof money you put into the industry on the basis of thisscheme.SIR ROBERT horne: That is not accurate.MR HARTSHORN: I know it is accurate.    If you are going toput  576,000 per week into   the industry, and a 2s. advanceequals  576,000 per week, if we put that amount in in order toget half the amount, that is all that is proposed, becauseon the  576,000 a week we. shall only get Is.MR DUNCAN: Are you prepared to wait to put the money intothe fund?   You want something whether it is there or not.
MR WINSTON: The employers always laid it down that when there was increased output the pay would he proportionatelymore; you are asking us to take proportionately less.&apos;THE PRIMS MINISTER: That is on the assumption your pric-es will remain; that is a risk you are not prepared to take.. MR WINSTON: It is not on that assumption at all; theyalways took the risk.THE PRIMS MINISTER: They are not taking the risk this time,- the risk is to   he taken by the State.    That is ourdifficulty.    If they took the risk, very well, that is their business; but it is a risk we have to take and put on theconsumer.MR HARTSHORN: let me put it to you as I understand the document.    This at the moment assumes there will be a profit of  3. 12. 0. per ton of export coal.    That is the basis ofthis scheme, and all coal above 219,million tons is to go into that category.SIR ROBERT HORNE: Not on profits - price.MR HARTSHORNj What this document says is this, that we will assume the September quarter price of export coal is 8^s.per ton; that on all output in excess of the September quar-ter there shall be 15s. per ton as extra wages, and the dif-ference shall be  3. 12.0. per ton.    That is your basis of calculation and on that you say if you get at the rate of246 million tons you will be up another 576,000 per week inthe industry, and you will be taking that much out in wages;that is at the rate of 8 million tons a year.    That is thebasis of this scheme.    Then on the second 8 million tons youput the same amount in, but yra we shall get Is. out.SIR ROBERT HORNEj You are neglecting the point.    We give you Is. on 238 millions, which is your present ou4$ that isto say, you get Is. without anything extra at all, and theother Is. is distributed over the other 8 points.    You get
Is. on the present ou&apos;1^.    That is a thing you are neglecting.MR HARTSHORN: If you lay that down then it means that over and above that for all time under the two periods we aretaking half out that we put in.SIR ROBERT horne: The point of that is that you are as-suming that the industry should contribute nothing at all to the Exchequer.    That is the assumption, because if you take all out there is nothing left,and indeed after this period there will he nothing left any way.MR HARTSHORN: This scheme does not take anything out.SIR ROBERT HORNE: That is where you make the mistake.The September output was got at a time when your wages wereIs. less than -we assumed for the September output no?;.    Weassumed at the rate of 238 million tons.   We are now givingyou an extra shilling on your wages on that 238 million tons which adds 15 millions a year to the cost.MR HARTSHORN: You get it all back.SIR ROBERT HORNE: No, we shall not.THE PRIME MINISTER: If we got Excess Profits out of theindustry in the ordinary conditions we should get far morethan this.A DELEGATE: How do you make out that?MR BONAR LAW: The price would be so much higher.MR ROBSON: The consumer pays in the end.MR BONAR LAW: When these negotiations started it was onthe assumption that you were going to take any increase uponthe actual output, that even for the Is. there was to be anincreased output.    We have not said, but in effect we havegiven that away, and we give you the Is. on the present outputoThat is really the point.MR SMILLIE,: We had better consider the matter alone.(The Prime Minister and his colleagues then retiredand the Miners1 Executive deliberated amongstthemselves).
On resumingMR SMI1LIE said: We recognise that we shall have considerable difficulty in carrying our men with us in the accept-you have put in, hut we cannot recommend the men to accept this scheme if those figures are in, and we are desirous thatthose figures should he taken out.    If they are we will ae-cept the scheme and recommend it to the men at the earliestpossible moment, with a view to trying to get a resumption ofwork, but we cannot recommend it with those figures in be-yon d the 2s.THE PRIMES MINISTER: We had better retire to consider theposition.(The Prime Minister and his colleagues retiredto confer amongst themselves).(A few minutes later Sir Robert Home andthe Coal Controller returned to the Con-ference Room).SIR ROBERT HORNE: This point that you raise now of courseinvolves other Issxxes and it might be very important issues.The question I have to ask you, Mr. Smillie, is this: Ifwe only make an arrangement now with regard to the 2s. riseand the values which would be appropriate to it, are you agreeable to say that you will raise no further wage claim duringthe temporary period and before a permanent settlement Isarrived at?-   -    MR SMILLIE: We could not possibly do that. A permanent settlement might not be arrived at for six months.SIR ROBERT horne: One would hope it would be arrivedat within as near a period as possible.    Of course, you see what the suggestion is.    If we arranged upon the basis as suggested now we might have another conflict at the end of theyear.    Supposing you got up to a figure of tonnage which gave proceeds outside of the limit of the 2s. rise, we mightanee of this scheme even without Those latter figures that5K
be involved in another controversy at the very time when youare trying to arrive at -a peaceable solution with the coalowners as to permanent regulation of wages.    Surely we want to avoid that.MR SMILLIE: Supposing it were possible to raise output to 250 million&apos;or values, it would not be unreasonable forus to suggest to the Government that there ought to be achange in the wages if you were justified in doing so fromthe results.SIR ROBERT HORNE: Why should not we fix that now and bedone with It?MR SMILLIE: It is because we want to settle this strike and we cannot do it with that in.SIR ROBERT HORNE: That means simply this, that you do notthink that the values we put opposite our tonnage will carry the men now and you will not be free to claim some highervalues.MR SMILLIE: Exactly.SIR ROBERT HORNE: That means you are increasing the claimyou previously made upon us.MR SMILLIE: No.SIR ROBERT HORNE: Porgive me; your scheme was 4s. for256 million tons; it is now 4s. for 254 million tons, if yourobjection to our figures is good.    We really cannot make asettlement which is simply going to leave the public in doubt as to whether we are not going to have, even in this temporarily-ary lull^another conflict brought about.    We really must ar-rive at a solution now.    It would be madness to go through allthe.agonies of the last three weeks again, and the dislocation of trade and the uncertainty which has sent countless orders to other countries rather than to our own.   We cannot facethat kind of contingency.MR SMILLIB: Those figures which have been put in todayfor the first time we did not expect to   be in at all.   We
unitedlyknow it will not be possible/to carry it out.SIR ROBERT HOMEs I hope it is plain to all of you gen-tlemen by this time that I am very anxious personally to makeit as easy as possible for you to carry your delegates.    Iam also very   anxious that the scheme we put before you shouldnot involve anything which by any chance could cause a diffi-culty between now and the period at which yous get your per-manent settlement.    There is no person could be more eagerthan I.MR SMIIdLE: We do not anticipate any trouble between now and that time.SIR ROBERT HORNE: If we do not settle what is to be donein the event of your getting an output which would give pro-ceeds justifying a higher rise than 2s. we shall be very apt to get into difficulty for this reason that, in my own heart,I feel confident that you will have a bigger output than that between now and the end of the year.    That is my view andit would be appalling if you are going to start anotherseries of conferences with all this uncertainty.MR SMILLIE: But if at the end of the year we are reaX-ly able to increase the output I think we shall ultimatelyreach a higher output than we think today.    If at the endof the year,  or if early next year we reach an increased output by   mutual cooperation between both sides, we arenot thinking for a moment that you would not be preparedto   deal generously with the men.   Bo not you think wecould mOet quite frankly and talk to each other and say:&quot;We have delivered the goods, what Is, the position between us?&quot;SIR ROBERT horne: The difficulty I see about that isthat that is raising all the questions again.   We suppose that during this temporary period that we have settledeverything that requires to be settled until yOu haveyour scheme ready, or have come to the conclusion that
the scheme cannot he devised - I hope the latter will nothappen   hut what we are trying to do at this moment isleave everything unsettled for that temporary period, wellHeaven only knows what will happen.MR BRACE: The reason why the difficulty is so pressingwith   the Executive is that to begin with we have to recom-mend this scheme and defend it, and at, the xaads meeting ofthe conference the men will naturally take this scheme and say: &quot;Oh, what is the inducement to,us to increase theoutput; we find that, operating upon the 2s. basis we getso much money if so many tons of coal come nut, but when we get above a certain amount that there is a much lowerscale,&quot; and whatever may be the figure this Executive feels that there must be uniformity of scale up above that pointif the men are not to turn down the scheme.SIR ROBERT HORHE: I will tell you my point about that.I know how difficult it is to explain things to large bod-ies of men who have not had the opportunity of hearinganalytical discussions such as we have had,    I have had to speak to Juries many times so I know something about this./But what I would sayls, the Government has given you thefirst shilling really on the present output; that is the explanation of the thing, and the other shilling represents the extra 8 points.   What faced me in trying to arrive at away of presenting this for your purposes was this.    I could have taken the previous quarter of the year, which was only an output of 232 million tons, and taken that basis andstarted off with that upon the scale up to 246 millions.. In-deed that was taking the lowest basis at which you had ar-rived in the year.    But instead of doing that what I did wasto take the third quarter of the year and give you the Is.straight away on the output of that quarter, and then say to settle everything for the temporary period, but if we
if you got up to the amount necessary to yield the proceedsin this quarter then you would get the full advantage of the extra yield.    But now, because I have taken the third quar-ter which was rather tetter, apparently it involves me inthis difficulty that I must increase the scale all the wayup.   Well, you never meant that, and you never thought ofthat, because when you discussed xk previously with the own-ers the scale upon the basis of tons and not of values youaccepted a scale which really demanded less than what youare now asking.   You know that perfectly well.    That certain-ly is so on the figures; absolutely so.MR HARTSHORN: I do not know that any proposal was madeon a 4s. basis.. SIR ROBERT HOBNE: Let me take this.    I can put it to youperfectly plainly.   Your lines proposed to the owners were at the rate of  40 million tons to give you a Es. advance,and at the rate of E48 million tons for a 3s. advance, thatis to say, you took Is. for 8 points.    That is exactly the &apos;scale that we are offering you above the 246, and the reason why it is more below the 246 is because we. are giving youIs. now and at once.   Now are you really going to take ex-ception to our scheme because we give you Is. earlier than would otherwise have been the case.    I thought I was reallymaking some advance towards you in giving you the shillingon 238 tons on your present output, but it seems that in-stead of helping I have made it more difficult for you.your own scale previously was Is. on 8 points, and that isthe same scale we are applying now above the  46 millions.You surely cannot object to our taking a scale which youyourselves put before the coal owners.A DELEGATE: Our contribution to what you said was yourdifficulty that you had no surplus at all until you gotpast the S40 millions.3X
2 3SIR ROBERT HORSE: Between 240. millions and 248 you made it Is. advance; that was your proposal, and that is exact-ly our proposal between the 246. and the 254 millions,  onlyit is more favourable.    I looked at the thing from the pointof view of giving you Is. right away upon your latest outputinstead of going back to your lowest output and scaling up from that.   How I do beg qf yon, gentlemen, I think I have met you&apos;quite fairly upon this matter, and personally I feelthat it would be ludicrous if we were really to break downbecause we apply that same scale that you yourselves applied.Mind you, if there is any way in which we can help to put this thing in a shape which makes it more recommendable to your prople I am willing to try,my very utmost to find a wayof doing so.    But I really cannot believe that you are sug-suggesting that we are unfair when we do what you yourselveshave done-when we make the scale as you yourselves made out.MR HARTHORH: You must not forget, Sir Robert, that.westarted off with 2s. application on existing figures.SIR ROBERT HORNE: I know you did.MR HARTSHORN: We said in order to meet any objectionthey have we will put 244 millions for ls.6d. and 248 millions for 3s.SIR ROBERT HORNE: That is not what you presented in the document.MR HODGES: That is in the document.SIR ROBERT HORNE: Show me the document.MR HARTSHORN^: That was our proposal to the coal ownersas far as fl remember, and it is true we did take into ac-count in making those proposals that the output for Septemberwould be 236 millions, but we said, between 236 and 240millions there would be no profit.   He had based his scheme on 240 millions with   such export as we were getting at thattime.   We made a jump there to meet that.   Then it is truewe went another 4 millions for another 6d. it was with a view
&amp;o meeting that deficiency.MR HODGES: This is the proposal we put to the owners;there we give 3s. at 248 millions, and 2s. at 240 millions.SIR ROBERT HORNE: 3s. for 248 millions; that is Is.from 240 millions to 248 millions; that is exactly the scale.You say   that 240 million tons was the Goal Controller^amount, giving a certain export, so that from 240 to 248millions there is really an amount of 8 million tons extrafor export.   Well, now, for that extra 8 million tons youasked an extra Is.   That is Is. for 8 million tons extra.That is exactly the scale that I am putting to you from246 millions to 254 millions, and the only reason why, he-low 254 millions the thing has even the appearance to youof being Is. for 8 million tons is because I give you Is.at 238.millions.MR HODGES: That is the whole difference.SIR ROBERT HORNE: I&apos; really cannot believe that when Iadopt your own scale of Is. for 8 million tons you can take exception to that.MR HODGES: That is not fair; if you take our proposalsyou must take them in their Entirety.SIR ROBERT HORNE: You must also   take our proposals intheir entirety.MR HODGES: that are they?   You give us 2s. at 246 mil-lions, and you give us 3s. at 254 millions.SIR ROBERT HORNE: But we give you Is. at 238 millions.MR HODGES: Your- proposals are 2s. for 246 millions and 3s. for 254 millions.    Our proposals in their Entiretyon the settlement basis are 2s. for 240 millions; 2s.6d. for244 millions; 3s. for 248 millions; 3s.6d. for 255 millions,and 4s. for 256 millions.    There is the difference.SIR ROBERT HORNE: If you are standing upon getting youroriginal figures then I should like you to say so. We shall then know where we are.
MR DUNCAN: You are not taking the proposals in their entirety; you must take the Is. for 838 millions, and thatIs. comes really from the pool and you are getting it straightaway between the 838 and 846, and between the 246 and 254 mlllioJiEanother Is.A DELEGATE: It is equally true we are getting Is. at842 millions.SIR ROBERT HQRNE: There must be some point always where you change.MR SMILLIE*,,Why continue quarrelling today about a risein wages which we are not asking for.MR DUNCAN: You are asking for a permanent scheme.MR SMILLIE: We are not asking you for ,a permanent scheme;we want you to allow the way to-be open for a permanent scheme.MR DUNCAN: You are asking that the permanent arrangementmay be settled down as soon as possible, that being so is it not right we should have a system now that will ca-rry on forra&amp;ftjr a reasonable time to give that permanent schemean opportunity.MR SMILLIE: We have a system that carries on.MR DUNCAN: If, for instance, you have 254 million tonsin the first 5 weeks are you going to take the 8s. then?Clearly you cannot have the permanent scheme fixed up by then.MR SMILLIE: You would then discuss, surely,MR DUNCAN: The meeting might interfere with the perman-ent discussions.   You   can fix an arrangement which iswithout prejudice to your discussions, but you cannot do that within a fortnight of concluding your permanent arrangemente*MR MC.QBMWS: If this was being dealt with by a miner&apos;aagent in a colliery he dare not face his men and recommend it to them.   They would turn him out of office.   You have toput us in the same position.
SIR ROBERT HORNE s Then although in your original proposal you had Is. for a rise of 8 million, you are notcontent to accept that now as part of the temporary scheme.MR HODGES: It is not possible ^tefe/^tadb statement togo unchallenged.SIR ROBERT HORNE: It is the truth.MR HODGES: No, it is not the truth.    We must analyseour original proposals, althoggfe. it seems to be quite irre-levant because the past is dead and gone, but rather thanthat should appear upon the notes it is necessary to say this.    We said we will accept Ss.6d. for, 44 millions, andwe will accept it for the reason that we want to give theGovernment an opportunity of having 4 millions more avail-able for export.   We know that there can be no value, so to speak, by increasing the quantities up to  40 millions, be-cause the home market requires it, but we said, when wehave got the  44 millions we know that the whole of the re-mainder will be used for export, and the values accruingfrom the remainder justify us in having an additional six-pence for an additional 4 millions, and we have thereforebrought it up to  48.   We said the same thing will operatefor all the remainder because it will go to exports.   We can get 4s. at  56, millions, disregarding the first stage al-together, because we knew the real medium of bringing usmoney is from the export..   That is the real reason.SIR ROBERT HORNE: That is exactly the same position to-day.    The whole basis of this thing is that the extra coal would be going to export, and in- the same way as you tookthat scale before, so it seems to me the same scale is ap-plicable today.   You see you &quot;have always told us that youthought.it was not possible, or would be very very difficult,to get up to a reasonable increase in the output of coal to yield larger proceeds within so short a time.   Now yourfor that
your argument turns round all the other way and you are evi-dently now as convinced as I am that you will get the larg-er output with the higher proceeds, and accordingly you re-fuse, as I take it, to make -any agreement now with regard tothese higher figures, with the result that we should haveto go to the public and say, where we have got a solutionof the present controversy, so far as this 2s. is concerned,they must anticipate that, within six weeks we shall heback arguing this question again upon a different state ofaffairs.     Really the country cannot stand that kind of thing.It is perfectly plain we cannot have these controversiesinterminably, and that we ought to arrive at some sort of reasonable settlement now.    It is no benefit to the country .to get rid of this quarrel now to have it six weeks henceand in the dead of winter.MR ROBSON: Could you give the Is. sooner?SIR ROBERT HOEBB: We propose to give you the Is. reallyupon the present output.MR HARTSHORNS Are you prepared to modify these clauses,Sir Robert?SIR ROBERT HOREE: I cannot suggest that we can modi-fy in principle what our plan is, but if there is any way inwhich we can express it so that it makes it easy for you torecommend it to your delegates, I am certainly very willingto do that.MR HODGES: When you say you are prepared to. modify itin principle, we have got plenty of principles already; areyou prepared to modify it so that out of the increased re-venue above the 246 millions that gives us increased output,are you prepared to modify it so that there will be increasedcash for the workmen?/
MR DUNCAN: Are you willing to take the/risk of themarket.   That is the whole point.SIR ROBERT HORNE: We are doing that, you see.   let me,put this to you. leaving these two months between now andthe New Year out of account, supposing you find in january the market really has broken   say by the end of Januaryyou have not your final scheme prepared.    The result is thatwe have guaranteed the price, and, assuming that the pricehas broken, no matter what it may be, you are going to come forward and say: &quot;Our output is bigger,and you are bound to guarantee the price of September because the output isbigger; we are not going to take the scale we previouslyput forward; we demand a better scale&quot; - really, is it right we should subject the country again to the uncertain-ties of a coal controversy?MR SMI1X-IE: On output or values.SIR ROBERT HORNE: On the values; let us take it on the values.   We cannot question the values, Mr. Smillie; that isthe position we have taken up under this.    We ,guarantee thevalue.    We say   the Government will not look at the question as to what coal has fallen to, but we will take the price ofSeptember.    There is our great difficulty which confronts us,and I really do not know how we should solve it then.MR SMILIjIFj; Supposing prices dropped in January.    We saidHigkteBSjE we have got beyond the output which justified onvalues the Es. which you have given; we want an increase in wages on that output, but you said to us: &quot;Output has in-Creased but values have declined; you would nfct be entitledto it.&quot;SIR ROBERT HORNE: You would, because, under this agree-ment we promised not to take into account any drop in prices;we take the price in September.MR SMEELIE: Eor the purpose of the Es.
SIR ROBERT HORNE: For the purposes of the whole agree-&apos;ment. - Therefore we would not he able to plead that at all.That is our difficulty; I think you really must see it.MR SMILLIE: I had not in.my mind that we, would come toyou in January for an increase in wages in        face of the face^**that prices were so down       if you give us that increase under this agreement.SIR ROBERT HO RMS: You would be. entitled to, Mr. Smillie,according to that plan.MR DOTCAW: You are not thinking of fixing any point atwhich we have to restore the position.    Obviously the strikehas cost money to the pool as it existed.    There is no accountbeing taken of our restoring any portion of that.    Previouslyyou claimed a share of the pool; it may he you are gettingfar more than the whole of it as it stands.MR ROBSON: That is where you are, but Sir Robert has not seen it in that form.   You have promised that beyond a eer-tain point in the revenue you will have to make provision to pay; you will make provision to replenish your pool from whatever you have.    That is why you are sticking to thesehigheBff clauses.MR DUNCAN: That is what makes this impossible. It isnot because&apos;the owners have been granted anything more.MR ROBSON: As you get further you get further obliga-tions. You want to replenish anything you lose, as far as you can, that is why the provisions are in.SIR ROBERT HORNE; I do not think we could replenish the pool at all; that is my own personal view; I am not reallythinking about replenishing any pool, I am thinking Of at-tempting to meet obligations to you.   We have to meet theobligations to you no matter what happens.MR ROBSON: As you.say we are here to get an agreement;this says up to a certain point in going up we give a guar-antee of Es.   Beyond that, for an equal number of tons they
they get Is.   We know exactly what we have to meet with from our men.    It has been in my mind for some time that this isfor the purpose of replenishing your pool and for the pur-pose of meeting the additional liability of the 2-g- per cent,of the owners 10 per sent.SIR ROBERT HORNE: I do not know whether it would meetyou if we started at 232 and give an intervening 6d. and,Is.and ls.6d. and 2s.MR ROBSON: That would not help us.SIR ROBERT HORNE: Really, that is the sense of the thing.MR ROBSON: We have here a clause which says that for thefirst 8 millions you will get a couple of shillings.SIR ROBERT HORNE: No, no.MR ROBSON: We are trying to convey to you -------SIR ROBERT HORNE: I will put it differently to you.What I shall say is I will give you Is. at. the present out-put, and then I give another Is. from 238 to 246, and thenanother Is. from 246, millions to 256 millions.MR ROBSON: That does not alter the fact that the men haveto give another 8 millions for Is.   Why cannot we he guar-anteed the same proportion in the Msmma1 higher regions?SIR ROBERT HORNE: I will guarantee the same proportion,but it will start lower.MR ROBSON: Then you rob it of the advantages we havehad.      It is published in the Press you have offered 2s. to start with.    In the scheme you hafebefore you you have to earn the money; the difference now is that you have the 2s.to start with.SIR ROBERT HORNE: We put down 2s. upon the basis of an output to come, and that is looking to the present situationwhich yields Is. to the men and another Is. on the assumedoutput, but then if the output does not come then it willscale down.    I am perfectly willing to put it like that if
mithat aids you.in presenting the case;  but if you are&apos; onlyputting this ease to me .in the endeavour to get another Is.on the top of that 2s. that really is not quite fair.   Atany rate, whatever the result was to he, if this is onlygoing to have the effect of landing us in another controver-sy, or some change very soon, well, obviously it is not worth while, is it?MR ROBSQN: Nohody wants that.SIR ROBERT HORES: Let us be free from controversy untilthe permanent scheme is fixed-    If we leave it to future con-troversy, I mean, leave it unsettled,  if you get the biggerproceeds than justify the 2s. then obviously       the end ofDecember we may be where we are today.A DELEGATE: Gould you make the Is. to operate at 250million tons?MS SMILLIE: If it goes out to the country that we askedyou to take out of this document any mention of further in-creases on the 2s. and allow us to endeavour with the coll-iery owners to raise the/output, it will be a strange thingif we do not break down on that.SIR ROBERT HORNE:.I think the country would regard it morestrangely still if the ostensible and acknowledged result ofit was to leave you to raise a further claim in six weeks1time.MR HODGES: Are ,you prepared to consider the terms ofthis particular paragraph of yours so as to read &quot;less&quot;as &quot;over&quot;,MR DUNCAN: That is a complete change.MR HODGES: All those figures there on the scaling down-ward read &quot;over&quot;.    That means that between those two figuresof 864,000 and 1,152,000 we get 2s.6d. when we get to jthatpoint or over that point we get 3s.    Now cannot that ^bye re-versed and say, 1,152,000 wkxhkexratfcweffgx3wkh or less^; 864,000or less 2s.6d. 576,000 or less, ls.6d. so that between the
two   figures the workmen stand to gain &quot;the sixpence in theintermediary stages.ME DUNCAN: How would that meet the point that has been raised?   The stages between 238 millions and 246 millions-show 2s. and the between 246 millions and 254 millions showIs.SIR ROBERT HORNE: It would still leave 8 millions re-presenting in one ease 2s7 and the other Is.MR HODGES: I am just putting it to you; your proposalmeans we have to produce 6 million tofts of. output before wehave got an extra 6d.   We are asking you, after we have got over 250 millions, whether for 251 millions we can get6d.SIR ROBERT HORNE: We may have to consider the ttltfrk^ waymz&amp;terr of getting round this difficulty, but I do not think wecan possibly leave it in the shape in which we,run the riskof really having another conflict at the end of the year.That really would be too terrible for contemplation.   Wemust really make a decision which will carry us through tothe period when you either fix a general scheme or fail to fix one.MR HODGES: I tell you that as long as these figures re-,main where they are we cannot come to an agreement.SIR ROBERT HORNE: It is really the figures?MR HODGES: And the values.    We do not want to revise themmerely for the sake of difference in form; they must be alarger quantity of money than you propose should come into our hands.SIR ROBERT HORNE; It is not then a question of what oneset of steps represent compared with another; it is amatter in which you demand a higher wage at a certain value. -MR HODGES: If figures are to come in at all we must havehave alreadybetter figures than you/put in, otherwise we ask you to ex-clude them altogether.
SIR ROBERT HOME: Otherwise you fight for a higher fig-ure at the end of the year.MR HODGES: It means we shall make an application to theowners with all the data before us for an advance in thewages if the date indicates we are entitled to an advance.The line we shall take will be one that is fair to take.SIR ROBERT HORNE: You   consider that, during the tem-porary   period, if there is any increase in output over the246 million line which would give you the value for 2s. thiswould justify you in your view in demanding better figures4-than what we have put before you, and that these you would present to the owners.MR HODGES: If you put that question in that way, Yes.ne verWe should/jsaaxx make the application ofi these figures.SIR ROBERT HORNE: Now I understand the.new position.I will report it to the Prime Minister.(At this point Sir Robert Horne and theIToal Controller retired to discuss the&apos; Position with&quot;the Prime Minister andhis c olleagues). &quot; &quot;On resuming---THE PRIME MINISTER said? Mr. Smillie, Sir Robert Hornehas reporter&apos; to us the further conversation which he has had with you, and I cannot conceal from myself and&apos; my colleagues the feeling that the issue has taken a very grave turn.    Iwas under the impression when we adjourned last night thatthe only issue between us was whether we should take the 11thof December   the last fortnight of November and the firstin December, as the determining factor for the ensuing weeks of December, or whether we should take the 5 weeks as proposedby you to determine the wages for January.    It was upon that basis that I presented the case to the owners this morning,and also to the Cabinet.    It was upon that basis that I ob-tained the decision of the Cabinet and also the owners.    I
was clearly under a wrong impression.    How an absolutelyfresh development has occurred, and it is clear now that weare only settling a dispute up to the point when the outputreaches  46 millions.    If the output reaches the figure whichit represents at the beginning of the year, without anyspecial effort, without any cooperation, without any appeal,without any assistance from the owners or miners1 leaders,if it reaches that, we are open to a new claim upon a new basis which has not even been revealed to us.    The 2s. whichwe have been engaged in talking about for weeks goes by theboard and we are simply negotiating a further strike in Jan*-uary.    I cannot accept the responsibility for that, neithercan my colleagues, and inasmuch as I have misled my colleage-ues,quite unintentionally, I shall have to give &amp;hem an op-opportunity of hearing the new facts, and we shall give a replyto you tomorrow.MR SMILLIE: As a matter of fact, we were agreed with youlast night and could have gone out and recommended it,but you have put an absolutely new point.THE PRIMS MINISTER^ do not want to argue that; I. am notsaying the fault is either yours or mine; but it is quite clear that I was under a wrong impression.    I was under theimpression that the whole of the scheme was accepted, prov-ided we took your condition.    Perhaps I had no right to cometo that conclusion.MR SMILLIE: That was correct.THE PRIME MINISTER: It is clear that I misled my colleage*-ues last night.    I misled the owners this morning. It opensan absolutely new issue; we-are simply negotiating a furtherstrike in January, and I think a very grave turn has beentaken.    If egret it very deeply.   We were disposed1 to takethe issue upon that point; we decided, after what Mr. Smilliesaid, that if we agreed to that there was an end of it.   We
decided to take the risk of a good deal of misrepresentationfrom the public in order to secure peace; but we were clearlywrong.MS SMIILTE: You are quite right, but you have put newterms before us which, were not before us before.MR HODGES: These were not before us ^yesterday or the day before.THE. PRIME MINISTER: It is no use arguing about that, Mr.Smillie or Mr. Hodges; you jfere under the impression thatthey were not in; we are under the impression they were.MS SMI1LIE: We can prove-------THE&apos; PRIMS MINISTER: If you do you simply prove what Iam trying to point out.    I presente d the case to my colleage-ues that the whole of the terms were in.   You say xsmscs: Ihad no right to do so.    Then it is clearly righ,t that Ishould tell my colleagues that I was under a wrong impres-sion.    One thing is. quite clear, whether I was right or wrong,that this is no settlement.SIR ROBERT HORNE: You said quite distinctly to Mr.Smillie and to Mr. Hodges whether they wanted an ascendingscale as well as a descending scale and we prepared the as-cending scale in consequence.    It cannot be said that wewere yesterday considering nothing but the Ss.    In fact, Mr.Hodges1 own document considers an ascending scale as well as &apos;a descending scale.    The question now put to us is whether we could cut out everything which refers to an ascendingscale.    It cannot be said that we were referring only toa descending scale yesterday, because we were discussing the prospects of an ascending scale as. well.    It can only   ,be the particulars of the ascending scale that were not known in their entirety to the miners yesterday.MR HODGES: When we left you last night our Presidentinformed you that if you agreed to the two points we raised in your document we would recommend it. ^
MR SMILLIE: You asked us if we would recommend it.MR HODGES: You asked sb. our  resident if he would re-commend it and he said &quot;Yes,&quot;   at that moment this is: all we had before usT-plus the preamble which you have put on your other document.    What you said last night was: &quot;(b)For the purposes of this temporary arrangement the advancereferred to shall continue to be paid unless for the monthof November or any subsequent month the proceeds of export coal after-deduction of the cost of extra output are lessthan 2,400,000 (the estimated cost of the advance) in excessof the average monthly proceeds of export coal during the quarter ended 30th September, 1920; in which event the ad-vance to be paid during the succeeding month shall be re-duced by 4d. 2d. and 1-jgd respectively for every 400,000 of.such deficiency or part thereof.nTHE PRIME MINISTER: It is no use arguing about that; we.&apos;jmust argue about the position as it is; unfortunately wehad no shorthand writer here,   By common consent.    Thereforethere is nothing to refer to.   All I know is that I was underthe impression, as the result of the discussion, that therescale. It was upon that basis that I presented the case tomy Cabinet colleagues.    You say now that I had no right toMR SMILLIE: Not at all.THE PRIME MINISTER: The facts did not warrant my doing so. It was upon that basis that I presented the case thismorning to the owners. All we get now is that if the outputexceeds 246 millions there is another controversy open andanother strike may.take place. That is a responsibility i cannot take for the public. Merely to close up the strikenow to open it again in January is a responsibility I cannotanwould beascending scale as well as a descendingdo so.
take.    I must present the case to my Cabinet colleagues, andwe will give you a definite answer tomorrow.    12 noon willsuit us, I think, if that is convenient to you.MR SMILLIE: Yes, that is convenient.TEE PRIME MINISTER: If anything is to be given to thePress then they must have a full statement.MR HOUSES: I think, Mr.- Prime Minister, that we can pro-perly say negotiations are continuing and nothing more.THE PRIME MINISTER: It is no use having ex parte state-ments.    That is a futile thing to do and I cannot conceiveof anything being more mischievous.    If the public must beinformed they must be informed of the whole of the facts.(The proceedings then terminated).
