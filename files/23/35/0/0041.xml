The Russian Government regarded the cannes Glauses as a basis of possible agreement-, but ifthe signature of the -Russian Government to the clausesus -drafted was demanded as a condition of their attendancesat Genoa., the Russian Government would be placed in avery difficult position,      They regarded the spirit ofthe conditions as one-sided..   &apos; Tho obligation on the.nations -asking for assistance, was spoken of in the -draftbut there was nothing as to any obligation on &quot;the &apos;.pa&apos;rt-1&quot;
of the stronger nations which were asked to ronder assiat?. The Russian view was that the basis should be reciprocity. There weren also various details which the Russian Government could not wholly assent to, but possibly these were due to somewhat hasty drafting. If the French proposals were adopted that the Russian Government should accept the resolution of January 6th as it stood, his Government would be placed in an extraordinarily difficult position.

MR. LLOYD GEORGE said that, as M. Krassin knew, he himself had for a long time favoured peace with Russia. He had, however, always thought that Russia must accept the conditions which were laid down in the Cannes Resolutions. After all, they were only the conditions on which every civilised Government conducted its affairs. Every Government undertook to accept the debts of its predecessors; for example, supposing in Great Britain an extremist labour Government came into office which had disapproved the war and said that the cost of the war ought never to have been incurred. Nevertheless, such a Government would never repudiate the debts incurred by its predecessors. All that was asked of the Russian Government was the same thing. There was no expectation that they could pay the whole debt at once. France and Italy, for example, owed very large sums to Great Britain, and Great Britain owed large sums to America - probably in the region of a thousand million pounds - but there was no question of those debts being paid immediately. All the nations concerned, however, acknowledged their obligations. Until Russia was willing to do the same he foared the business community could not be brought whole-heartedly to accept any arrangement with Russia. The German Government, he was informed, found exactly the same need for Russia to acknowledge her debts. There were, for example, obligations by


Russia in regard to property which, had been taken fromBritish nationals.      He himself had recently mot a gentlemanwho owned several factories in Russia which&apos; had boon taken away from him and which were new derelict.      All that wasashed was that the Soviet Government should accept the prin-ciples of the Cannes Agreement   and state their willingness to discuss the application of the principles.      He yuitarealised the force of what M. rassin said in regard toreciprocity.      There was; however, no question of this sinceGreat Britain accepted the principles of January 6th.      Ifthe Soviet Delegation oould make a corresponding claimagainst the Western Governments, they wore . entitled to makeit at Genoa.      In fact,   if they had such a claim,  it was allthe more reason for accepting the principles.      Ho himself was only trying to get the Conference together.      If, howeverM. Chichsrin began tgniggle and introduce -all&apos; kinds of gualif modifications, we should never have the Conference this side of theDay of -Judgment.     He hoped, therefore, that.Russia would say definitely that she accepted the Cannes conditions ofJanuary 6th, and was willing to discuss their application.Ho begged that whoever was responsible for the reply wouldnot give a qualified answer, but would sny that he acceptedthe conditions..      He himself had. given an answer in the Houseof Commons on the previous day containing the hint of thesuggestion as to what the Soviet Government should reply Ifthey took a different lino and hesitated , there would be noConference.      If they did not accept,  there was no use. in holding a meeting and things would be worse than ever.     he hoped, therefore, that the Soviet Government would give a simple answer to the effect that they ware willing to acceptthe principle of the Resolution of January 6th and to cometo Genoa to discuss its application.      Every previous effort
to bring Russia to a Conference had failed because someclever gentleman had drafted a reply which had blocked theway.      Thus Russia had been kept out for two or three years from these Conferences with the result that when famine cams,all his colleagues wore helpless to do what thoy would liketo do,  since people said it was no use dealing with such aGovernment,.LORD CuRBOR pointed out that there were people at Parisalso who wished to keep-the Russians out.      The BritishGovernment -anted to send a very civil answer to the Frenchand to bring the French into the Conference.      He presumed that M. Eras sin wished the Conference to take place.(MoErassin nodded in the affirmative].      If, however,  theSoviet Government started to quarrel and haggle as to thebringingconditions, there was no chance of     I      France in.MoERaSSIM said that so far the Russian Government had raised, no objection .to the Cannes conditions.      The difficult&apos;arosg owing to France wishing to insist on the signing ofthis Resolution as. a condition of participating at Genoa.In signing these-conditions, Russia would be signing a one-. sided clause., which was a danger to herself.,      There was nothing in the Resolution which compelled France to recogniseher obligations,.    For example,  two hundred million roublesof Russian gold had. been taicen to Paris from Berlin,MM.,LLC YD. -GjjRGM pointed our that tne gold had been paid by Germany as. their contribution...M..ERkSSIiJ agreed but said that France had not rooog-nised the Treaty of Rrest-Litdvsk, .-MR. L10YD GMOkGiS said that If Russia was going to putoff participation in -Conferences for years for a very dbubt-ful claim which she. would certainly never,realise , the case was hopeless.     M.Boincare-would never agree to recognise .
iri advance&apos; such a claim and. there was not -the smallestchance    of Russia ever getting this. gold.      The only -result would ha tnat they would lose tne chance- of free intercourse&apos; hit ERAS SIR said that- it was -hot free intercourse; if .-one side had only obligations and the other -side -had claimswithout obligations. -. \\..*;   :  ...       -MI;, 110YD CkORGE said that all these claims could be maat uenoa.     All that Russia -need-. say now was. that she accept in principle the Resolution of - January .6th and. to .stateher willingness to come -to Genoa to ;Discussion-ss its application.At Genoa they&apos;could ma^e-their claims,-      M*Bonomi , whois likely to be Chairman,- was not unfriendly to Russia andwas not likely to rule such. questions as out of order. ..LORD CUkL-Ois then read a extract from M.Roincar6r s Hotssetting forth the French attitude on this; question.      he pointed out that- all that the Prime kin-ister asked was thatthe Soviet Government should accept the-&apos;-, conditions ofJanuary 6th in advance; retaining the right to raise their claims at the Conference. - -- MR* LLO YD. ^GEORGE pointed out that -  for example, theRussian Government might-have claims of one thousand millionagainst them, but.might raise a counter claim of.one hundredmillion in their favour.    -Their reply should be to accept. the principles of the Sarnie s Resolution and to state thatthey were prepared to discuss their -application..- MsKEASSIiJ said that there were, juridical objections toadopting this course.      If-they accepted, the conditionsof January 6th\ they would be in.the nature of a contract *ME. LLOYD GEORGE said that - if... the . formula he had pro-posed Was adopted-, there would be no-.. contract involveduntil the application of the&apos; principles;--.had been discussed at Genoa the eustace-siaii Delegates could put, forward, their wholecase.   . He strongly urged tnat they should telegraph
to Ms Bottom! that they accepted tire principles agreed to o:aJanuary 6th at Cannes and wore prepared to discuss their applcation. .   He himself would regard these words asgiving the Russian representatives the right to raise anycoiuiter/claims  , hut if M* Chichorin sent a halting reply, he knew perfectly .well wn.at M-Eoincare would do.      He himself was/quite willing that the Russian counter claims should bediscussed at Genoa, hut if they were discussed before then,the Conference would never moot and Russia would be playingstraight into the hands of her enemies,   .  These treatieswould take some&apos; weeks- to discuss at Genoa and there wouldbe ample opportunity for the Soviet Government, which wouldbe adequately represented,  to raise anything they wished,M; KRr.SSIR said that tha Treaties could not be signed at Genoa but could only be settled by the Governments,MRVLLOYD GEORGE said that if the...nations were  represented by plenipotentiaries,  they would.be able to sign at genoa,-      He would be there with full authority from hisGovernment.     MMPoincare would have full authority from hisGovernment and M..Ronomi from the Italian Government.      he presumed that the Soviet representatives would also have full powers,.M. KkASSLN then asked for further information as tothe economical measures proposed fox Genoa-MR * LLOYD GEORGE said that Sir Laming Worthington Evans&apos;was in charge of this side of the preparations\      The general idea was to form a- eorporation with a&apos; small capital of say30 million and for each country to form its own cor-porat,Ion in addition*-    The first idea had teen a big cor-poration with,a common pool.      This proposal, however, had broken down on the question of exchange- -    It had been founddifficult to decide what standard should bo taken for the
basis of its operations , e.g, the sterling standard, the franc or the lire, etc. Consequently, it had been thought better to have separate national corporations with a central corporation for purposes of co-ordination. For example, Germany required financial facilities to enable nor corporation to operate.

LORD CURZON said that a statement as to the general scheme had been published.

M. KRASSIN thought that this was not the ?.

MR. LLOYD GEORGE, after referring to a document containing the various Cannes Resolutions, undertook to furnish such portions to M. Krassin as concerned this scheme and to let him have them before his departure on Monday.

LORD CURZON undertook to do this on behalf of the Prime Minister.

In reply to a further appeal by Mr. Lloyd George for a simple acceptance of the Cannes Resolution on the lines he had proposed, M. KRASSIN said that Russia had her own public opinion, which might change, but changed very slowly.

MR. LLOYD GEORGE urged stronly that the Russians should adopt the Cannes principles and state that they were ready to discuss itheir application. Then they would be able to put forward their counter claims, which, so far as the British Government was concerned, would be carefully considered.

M. Krassin then withdrew.
