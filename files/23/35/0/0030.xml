OU J if X ; :.ki i&apos;X &quot;ii *Hotel Criilon,Place do la Concorde,Paris.28th January, 1981,Dear Lord Cursson,I think I ought to tell you of a conversation whichthe Jbriae Minister had with Count Sforsa yesterday in mypresence..     Count yforsa opened by referring to the suggestionhe had made on tho previous day th&amp;t the Tureo-Greek conference with-the Allies should be held in London,     He said that inmaking the suggestion he had felt that- London would be more acceptable to ail parties, that they would got iaoi*e fair playthere and, more especially, he attached importance to Mr.LloydSeorgre himself presiding.     He then went en to say that he had himself hold a diplomatic post feany years ago-in Constantinopieand had made many friends and aetruaintaaees there, and. that &quot;forthat reason he had-kept open possible means of communicationwith some of the influential Turks*     He then referred moreparticularly to Jalaat, who. is. at present in Berlin, and who,he says, possesses great influence with &apos;-&apos;Ustupha Kc&amp;al.     Hesaid he uished to consult the prime . inis-ster as to whether itwould bo worth-while for bin to give Talaat a hint that the1.
London Conference would offer Mustache SCeiaal the last opportunity -uaity to reach a settle&amp;ent        that for this reason it was essential he should send a thoroughly-good representativeana not adopt an intransigent attitude.      alaat hli&amp;eelf, ofcourse, could not possibly go to voodo&amp;v hut he could uadoubted-ly exercise a favourable Influence on ifttstapha Keiaal.     After ashort conversation, the &quot;rime Minister said that it would bedesirable for Count Sforsa to take this action, and Count Sforsaconcluded by stating that he would send a -special emissary to berlin to get in touch with Talaat*. She remainder of the conversation was devoted mainly toSeparations and I do not think it,is worth while for me to recall what 1 can remember of the conversation beyond statingthat Count sforaa expressed himself very much of our   point of,view.     Furthers he certainly gave me the.impression, that he intended to stato^ his views in the afternoon much mere definite--ly than he actually did.     1. gathered that his intention wasto say that he certainly understood Boulogne to be a definiteagreement, but an agreement as to tho ssasimura which we wore*to ask from Germany.At the end of tho conversation, the Prirse Minister asked&apos; - AS&apos;-
Count Sforssa as to Signor G3dLltfci*s position, and hesaid that he thought Signor Glolitti had weatheredhis difficulties.     He added that,in his opinion,/     some few years hence the Italian method of dealing withtheir labour and industrial conditions would be foundto set. the example to the world as the proper meansof settling such disputes?Yours sincerely,, /I f m pi :Hon*        -The Earl Ours on ol ICedleston, 3C*G*Hotel Hits,Place Vendo^ae,Paris *
