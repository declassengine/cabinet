Notes of a conversation which took place at a Luncheon held at the Hotel Beau Rivage, on Wednesday, December 8th, 1920, at which Mr. Balfour, Mr Fisher, Viscount Ishii, and Baron Hayashi were present.

After some discussion as to the desirability Of Governments appointing liaison officers With the headquarters of the League, and also as to the best means of expediting the work of the Assembly, R. Balfour referred to the question of Mandates, He said he ?hought that it was very important that this question should ?attled as early as practicable by the Council of the League as, if ?his were not done, it was quite possible that the Assembly might ?ake the law into their own hands and insist on discussing the matter ? public. He added, in reply to an observation by Mr. Fisher, that ?he fact of No. 6 Committee having, on the previous day, appointed Sub-Committee to go into the question of Mandates was all the more ?eason why the Council should deal with the matter at the earliest ?ossible moment.

The situation as regards the "A" Mandate was then discussed.

VISCOUNT ISHII pointed out that the only "A" Mandate of ?hich he was in possession up to date was the french Mandate for ?yria. He had no power to approve this Mandate on behalf of his ?overnment and he had accordingly communicated the text of the document ?Tokio by telegraph, and expected to receive a reply in the course ?f a few days.

MR. BALfOUR explained that the texts of the British Mandates ?or Palestine and Mesopotamia had been transmitted on the previous ?y to the Council of the League and there was no reason why copies ?f these should not be given at once to Viscount Ishii so that he ?houd communicate them if he wished to his Government. Indeed, if ? (Mr. Balfour) had known that it was necessary for Viscount Ishii ?refer to Tokio, he would have arranged for the texts to have been ?iven to him at the same time as they were sent to the Secretary-?eneral. He regretted that this had not been done. In any case, .....he


doubted if the actual terms of either the Mesopotomian or the%lestiD.e Mandate was a matter in which the &quot;Japanese Government wouldile! that they were very much interested. ;    That for -Mesopotamia was practically the same as the.2roneh.Mandate for Syria, but of course,that for Palestine&quot; differed in so far as the Zionist aspect-of thesituation had to be met.&apos;. As he had already said, however, ,hc did notttink that in either&apos; case, the Japanese Government would feel thattheir interests, were affected,, and in this opinion Viscount Ishiiagreed,.:.Vr   ;.,.   , &quot; &apos;-.....It was .arranged that copies of the &quot;Mesopotamlan and PalestineMandates- as...transmitted to the Council should be given that afternoon^lo. Viscount I.shii, - -. -&apos;-;.1.      ;.   ...... SIR CECIL HURST explained the situation as regards the &quot;B&quot;Mandate,. . .. .The text of this Mandate&apos; had been drawn up rather more than-i-year previously by a Mandates Commission, which met.under the Chair-manship of: Lord Milner in London and on which the Japanese/Governmentlas represented, . .I..-- As regards Togolahd&apos;&quot;and the C-amcroons, the . decision ofShe Supreme Council of May 7,. 1919 j was that France, and Great britain should...make a joint recommendation to-the- League of-Nations,as totheir future-.      This decision might mean either that there should be -ho Mandate at all or a special MandateIt was- now-agreed -that thereShould be a Mandate, but that such Mandates Would --have., to contain-some special provisions since owing to the geographical boundariesif. th.e territories in question it would-be difficult to. arrange for[their efficient administration by. the respective-mandatory powers,Bnl.sss-.they were more or less treated as integral..parts of. the[existing territories of these powers.     An amendment in the form of* tho Mandate was also proposed. --&apos;-&quot;-&apos;...       ....   .,H VISCOUNT ISHII said he had not himself got a copy of;the &quot;B&quot; Mandate but if Sir Cecil Hurst was-sure that Viscount Chlndaj 4&amp;d been given the document, he agreed that all-that it would bej-B-ecessary for him, to do was to wire to&apos; his-Government explaining the, ^ffiendments which it was proposed to make in the original toxt....... SIR CECIL-HURST-2-      - . - ...... -
SIS uisCIIL JETDS3&apos;j? undertook to arrange that yisoounb ishiii should he given a copy of the ;TB&quot;&apos; Mandate and also when available]the amendments proposed, The aaaeisdaients agreed upon by the$ranch and British Governments wouldp he thought8 be ready in thej course of a day or two.MS* M3HFOUB then referred to the nC&quot; Mandateo     He under-jstood that so far as the British Government were concerned,, the test of the document had.- been completed in aao-o^anso with the terms of[the Covenant.     Certain negotiations had, he understood, taken placefjbetween the Japanese and British Governments in connection withphis document6    He himself had had nothing to do previously withI the consideration of the &quot;question, and he would like to know what[was the exact situation.vTSCOUHP ISHII explained that after the Conference at,Spas certain negotiations had taken place between the British andMs own Governments .    The offer on the part of the British Governmentto give to Japanese&apos; subjects who were in possession before &quot;tho war,of property or concessions. in the mandated territories., an under-itaking that th-processes ooroessions should be re^gnisei and that theyKhbuld noT be deprived of their vested rights without reasonablecompensation, was not. in tho opinion of the Japanese Government,really any concession -at all.&apos;     . jfor in view of the assistance which had been given by Japan to the British naval forces in the pacific during the war,    the very least which his Government could expect as regards the treatment of Japanese subjects in the terri-j&amp;ories under Australian, control, was the same treatment which theyhad received when these territories had been under the Germans.:fie. pointed out that the Commonwealth Government had in 1918prevented a Japanese vessel from loading cargo at Rabaul-, and that owing to the subsequent attitude of. that Government and therestrictions Imposed., Japanese vessels had had to give up callingWt the port.   All that the Japanese Government wanted was an-3- ......assurance
p^urame of more generous treatment than they had received up toA long discussion then ensued on tho question of theLgotiatlons which had taken place between the two Governments,&apos;luring which Sir Cecil Hurst explained that the communication fromliscount Uchida dated August 2nd, 1920 had been interpreted by HisJajesty&apos;s Government as being a refusal on tho   part of theJapanese Government to entertain lord Curzonfs proposals made anJuly 1920.BARON HAYASHI said that his Government was stillam a r0ply to - -BUSt. 1M0.id had never dreamt that the British Government were under thelaprossion that the Japanese note of that date was regarded byIis Majesty7s Government as a refusal to consider the matterurther.VISCOUNT&apos; ISHII said that what his Government wanted wasme assurance that Japanese subjects would be given fair treatmenti tho future.   There was no question of their expecting that japanese immigrants would be allowed into the mandated territoriesquestion, but what they, wanted to make sure of was that those[Japanese who were already there would be given fair treatment andslowed to develop their trade.    He would also like to point outlat freedom of commerce was accorded to Australian vessels in theJlands north of the Equator, which were under Japanese control,&amp; It scorned very unfair that the Commonwealth Government shouldEp restrictions on the loading and unloading of goods by Japanese;vessels in the port of Rabaul.MR. BALfOUR thought that the case which Viscount Ishii,If referred to of a Japanese vessel having been refused permission&apos; I load cargo at Rabaul must have been an isolated one and probablyAdministrative blunder, and he could not believe that theI &quot;-ffionwealth Government would not be prepared to give to theIanese shipping,  similar facilities for trade with Rabaul as they.......gave
gave to such shipping at any other ports in the Commonwealth.

He would like to ask whether there had been any complaints of discrimination against Japanese shipping in any other Australian ports.

VISCOUNT ISHII said he did not know if this were so, but he had personally never heard of any complaints having been made as regards the treatment of Japanese shipping in ports such as Melbourne or Sydney.

SIR CECIL HURST suggested that the refusal on the part of the commonwealth authorities to allow a Japanese ship to load copra at Rabaul was possibly a war measure and due to the fact that they could not allow the export of the copra in question to Japan.

MR. BALFOUR said he presumed that Viscount Ishii&apos;s objection would be satisfied if the Australian Government were prepared to give the same treatment to Japanese subjects and shipping in the mandated territories as they gave to these subjects in the Commonwealth itself.

VISCOUNT ISHII thought that this would meet the views of the Japanese Government.

MR. FISCHER asked if the general question of the  facilities to be given to Japanese shipping to trade with Australian ports need necessarily delay the acceptance by the  Japanese Government of the proposed form of Mandate, and he suggested that it might be dealt with in a separate agreement.

Some discussion then ensued as to the exact formula to which the Commonwealth Government would be prepared to agree, and MR. BALFOUR undertook to consult Senater Millen, the Australian Delegate to the Assembly, at the earliest possible moment.
