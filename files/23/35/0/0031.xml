M     -$$$to189 ggg&amp; DffKFSBIOira f P ,ITALY, f.By Sir Maurice Hankey r.I have jpuet returned from a short holiday in the Seuth of Italy,soleThe/ $&amp;jeot ef my visit was to obtain sunshine   and an uninterruptedrest *   it would be presumptuous to endeavour en so slenoer a basisto attempt any exhaustive repsrt on the conditions of the country.Nevertheless I did have rather exceptional opportunities to pickcup certain scraps of information which might be of interest, andthese are set forth belowoi2. owin   to the uncertainty as to the duration of the Parisfor my journeyConference. I was unable to seoure sleeping accommodation/inadvance,    count    3forza however came to my aid and gave me ao&amp;mpartment in his personal car.   He was an admirable hos^t- andI had much interesting conversation with him (and his staff) inthe train,  ana again in Roa^e when homeward, bound.    In Rome also  had an hour&apos;s conversation with signor   Giolitti while lir.Mattel! his physician and most intimate friend, was my constant .oempanion during my short stay in Rome.    The information derivedfrom these sources was supplemented and explained by numerousconversations with sir George Buchanan, who entertained me atthe vmbassy and with members of the Embassy staff.Perhaps the most convenient method of setting forth thepoints of interest I picked up will be to pivot them round theprincipal individuals whexa I encountered.Signor Gjolitti.Travelling about in Italy, and gossiping with all kindscf people I gathered the impression that, whatever views may beheld of si nor Giolitti&apos;s attitude towards the war, he isgenerally   regarded as the right man anc the only man to deal withthe present political situation.It is customary in Italy for the Priixe itlnister of italy to oooupy the post of Minister *f the Interior.   All accounts agree
that signor Orlando and Si .;nor ITitti had. allowed the internal situation to degenerate to an incredible degree-,   ^&quot;hen Si ;;norGiolitti came into Office, therefore, he was faced with apolitical situation of the utmost gravity.       disorder.wasrife in all parts of the country.   Factories were beingseized by the workers; strikes were incessant; a   general strike on - the railways had only been averted by disastrousconcessions; there was much incipient Bolshevism, andinsurrection was in the air.Signor Giolitti appears to possess many of the qualitiesrequired for dealing with this situation.   He has unrivalledpolitical experience ano sagacity, he is not easily rattled;he has a sound physical constitution baseo on an extraordinarilysimple and regular habit of life; his great age (nearly 80)tends to dispel any idea of personal ambition.-  &quot;hen our Prime Minister met signor Giolitti at Lucernehe was impressed by the ruoh greater interest he displayedin home than in foreign politics.    This perhaps is the keyto his handling the situation..   He has devoted his energiesalmost wholly to the internal situation.At my interview I began by saying that,  if (IV). LloydGeorge had been present, I knew he would have hastened to congratulate signor $iolitti on the successful issue of the-prolon.;ec. parliamentary crisis on the question of the priceof bread.    I assured him also that his success would   be a source of satisfaction to the pr&quot;i;..c minister.    I then said that my only message to hirn from Mr. Lloyd George was a coraialinvitation to attend the forthcoming Conference in London.This at once launched Signor Giolitti on a mostintere ting dissertation on his Parliamentary situation.   Hewould be glad enough to come to London if circumstances
permittee, but for the moment the parliamentary situation requiredhis presence.First ana fore-most was the question of the bread subsidy.The Government had determined to reduce it *   Thf socialistshad        opposed the reduction and had put up an unparalleledparliamentary obstruction.   The Italian parliamentary procedureprovides no closure.   The Bolshevist   element wanted toremove the subsidy altogether, as this would provoke revolu-tion.    &quot;And how will yod. reduce the price of bread after therevolution?&quot;   was Giolitti&apos;s retort,   pvfentually some eortof a deal was done.    Apparently there are to be two kindsbreadof bread - a coarse / partly subsidised and a finer bread for those who can pay, Some people in Romte. Say that theworkin , classes who are in receipt of very high wages willbuy the higher priced bread.   However this may be SignorGiolitti was highly satisfied with the deal,, which, hesaid would result in talcing five iftilliardfet Of lira, off thebudget.The next question to which he referred was that ofthe factory legislation Elation.   It will be recalled that after the seizure of factories last Autumn signor Giolitti forjieda com?.i 3sion conposed of representatives of Ci^ployers andemployed to graft a Bill providing for thS Association ofrepresentatives of the workers in the control     of industry.ITo agreement was reached and eventually the Government under-took to introduce a Pill.   This is bow reaay ahd Signor Giolittihanded me the draft.   Dr. liattoli told me that SignorGiolitti has drafted almost the whole of it himself.   7 verymorning ahd every afternoon he would complete two or threeclauses for discussion with his expertsa2sText, signor Giolitti referred very briefly to animpending reorganisation of the Labour ministry, involvingapparently, the participation of employers ana employed insoiae council, but he was talking Italian and I cannotremember any details.
i 3At this point he began to speak with great vivacity-andclearness on a subject which is evidently very near his heartyas he kept returning to it, namely the development of the co-operative   movement.   It appears that the Co-operative movementhas advanced very far in Italy,  and that there already existsa co-operative Bank which has achieved considerable success,Signor Giolitti&apos;s plan is for the Government to double thecapital of this institution ahc. to carry out an immenseextension of its enterprise.&apos; He considered this to be amost promising development.   He said he already knew instances of extreme Socialists who had been preaching communism,-whohad become so interested in its development that they hadbeoome very valuable members of society.   Ken who had onlyworked seven hours a day were now working thirteen.   He hopedof the for a great extension/Co-operative movement in agricultureand the brown ooal mines that were developed during the war.An essential part of his policy is the development of italy national resources in order to reduce her dependence on imports, ana the extension of the Co-operative movement is animportant feature of this policy.Finally, he mace s. brief reference to a difficulty that has arisen in regard to education.   It will be recalled that during gignor Fittl&apos; s terv.: of office a new party called the Catholic Party,  came into existence.    This Party hasitto be placated, because if/voted with the socialists, itcould, upset trie Govern vent .   Qne of its demands is that theState examination should be extent.ed to the Catholic schools in order to avoic the present neoessity for the students at these schools to  co elsewhere for their exaainations.    this project has recently been rejected by one of the ParliamentaryCommissions, which  d :nor Giolitti has set up on the Frenchmodelo    This has put the Government, in a dileviaa, as theyhad promised to support the Bill, and they cannot afford-to&apos;     overthrow/the Cat&apos;1 olic party,    -nr. Mattoli stated that the Govern-ment intended to force the Bill through parliament,  notwith-standin;-. the action of the parliamentary Coi/ad ssion.    I might
interpolate here that in conversation with Count for&amp;a, Ireminded, him that I had heard one Italian Statesman after another (gaiandra, gonnino, Orlando,  3Sfitti) state that nothing would induce there to introduce the system of Parlia-mentary commissions in Italy.    Count sforza   admitted, theywere a great tax on ::ini stars, but said, that, provided the commissions were treated frankly and given plenty of informa-ticn,  they were not unreasonable.I was careful not to interrupt   Signor Giolitti in hisvery interesting sketch of the internal situation,    in factI asked many questions, and told hiiu that the Prime minister was particularly interested in them, and. weuld be glad toreceive mere detailed information, which he at once under*took to supply.orhen he had concluded I turned the conversation on toForeign Policy.   As at Luoerne, he was less expansive onthis subject.As regards reparations, he began by saying that forthe moment we should have to mark time, in order to siretime for the French hot-headB to cool down.    I then  remarked that events had developed so far that we should be obliged totake some, definite step forward at the forthoo:.dng Conference.He then said that he had no belief in a scheme which providedfor payments by Germany extending ever 30 or 40 years,    veshould reach a point when Germany&quot;would rather fight a newwar. than ga on payings   Hence, his view was that we should, aim at getting as much as we could out of Germany during thenext few years.   He showed the same scepticism about obtainingany considerable reparation from Germany as he had displayedat Beulogne.    This part of the conversation particularlyinterested me as he hau&quot;&quot;shortly before seen M. Sarrere,  theFrench Ambassador.
On the subject of Greece and Turkey he had but little to say. He considered this question even harder than that of reparations, and added with conviction that the Kemalist Delegation would have a very close "subterranean" connection with the official Turkish Delegation. I then emphasised the great importance and difficulty of the subjects to be dis? at the forthooning London Conferences and said that was why the Prime Minister attached so much importance to his personal co-operation. We again alluded to his parliamentary pre-ocoupations but eventually fell in with and indeed seemed very gratified by a personal suggestion which I ventured to make, that, if Mr. Lloyd George considered the conference was reaching a stage at which hie presence would really be important he should send his a personal telegram. In this event he would ask ? Italian Parliament to suspend its activities while he proceeded to London. Dr. Mattoli told me that Signor Giolitti takes a price in not allowing his great age to interfere with his public life, but hinted that the journey to Paris would be much easier and less exhausting than to London.

Signor Giolitti made a short allusion to Russia. The Bolshevists had made a great effort to foist Litvenoff on the Italians, and, during the negotiations the agent previously designated, had contracted a "maladie diplomatique". On the final rejection of Litvenoff he had suddenly recovered and was now stated to be on route. Count Sforza had previously told me that Italy does not count on getting much from the resumption of trade with Russia, as there is not ? to be act. The main object of the trace agreement, as in England, is to rev?eve the criticism of the socialists that the Government are preventing promising trade. Count Sforza added that Russian theat was urgently needed in Italy, as it is essential to the production of macaroni. There is u? a serious shortage of macaroni, and every carriage driver hired for the day stipulates for a mid-day macaroni for part of his pourcoire? Signor Giolitti said that Italian Socialists who had returned
from Russia were completely disillusioned and gave a very grim? account of the  condition of that country. He was much less optimistic about the future of Russia than he had been at Lucerne.

I then asked him whether Bolshevism had taken root at all in italy. He scouted the idea. Out of 156 socialists in the Chamber, only 17 professed Communist principles,  and they only did so in order to make a splash. In the Maples region I saw no signs of Bolshevism and the alleged Bolshevist movement at Castellamere was greatly exaggerated. In Rome however I saw the words "?iva Lenin" scrawled cn the walls.

One very interesting development which I just touched on with Signor Giolitti but gursued with Dr. Mattoli, is the "Fasoisti". These are unions of ex-service officers and men, who are constantly attacking the Socialists and have inspired them with something approaching terror. In fact, the Socialists have had to avail themselves of the protection of a new Police Force, which signor Giolitti had forced through parliament in the teeth of their violent opposition.

Towards the end of the conversation Dr. Mattoli intreduced the subject of Americans ship-building programme. Signor Giolitti said it was directed entirely against Japan. What America feared, he said, was that Japan would secure a foot-held in Mexico, and organise Mexican man-power against her. To me this is a novel,  and I think an improbable, theory.

In saying Good-bye signor Giolitti sent most affection ate messages to Mr. Lloyd George, for whom, I am convinced he has the sinoerest admiration and a genuine liking. Infact, I can only attibute to this his granting me a whole hour in the middle of a Parliamentary orisis,  and the extraordinary hospitality shown to me - motorcars, boxes at the opera, bouquets to my wife on arrival and departure,etc. ,.. etc.


Signor Giolitti left on me the impression of a man who has already surmounted prodigious difficulties and is gradually winning through. Serene and confident in his new experiments in social legislation he shows no trace whatsoever of the strain to which he has been subjected: Possibly, however, he is feeling the strain more than he shows. Count Sforza gave me an amusing account of an incident at the Cabinet, when Signor Giolitti gave a young Minister such a "dressing down" that he intended to resign. At the end of the meeting however Giolitti completely won him over by saying that he himself was really too young to restrain his feelings at times.

Count Sforza

Count Sforza is so well known that I will only mention one or two facts about him that may not be widely known His training was entirely in the Diplomatic Service and it is only recently that he entered Political life. He has gained immense prestige as the result of his successful handling of the Fiume situation. For this he has received the coveted Order of Knighthood of the Annunziata which makes him automatically a "cousin" of the King of Italy, and, as he told me himself entitles him for the remainder of his life to a special car on the Italian state Railways. This has excited some jealousy, and his predecessor, M. Tittoni, is stated to feel it very strongly. Count Sforza is a poor man, but nevertheless married a poor wife, a marriage of affection. The Countess is of Belgian birth, a quiet unaffected lady with a perfect knowledge of English and universally popular.. Count Sforza is a man of great physical energy I have myself met him swimming in a cold sea at Boulogne. During the journey to Rome he never missed an opportunity to leave the train and restlessly to stride up and down the platform.   I formed the impression that the direction of Italy&apos;s foreign policy is almost entirely in his hands, particularly since his success at the recent Rapallo Conference. He does not conceal that he has deliberately kept open the possibility of communication with some of the young Turks (notably Talaat) whom
he used to know in former days at Constantinople. He professes to bear no hostility towards the Greeks, and to have no territorial ambitions for Italy in Asia Minor.   He roundly condemned to me Sennino&apos;s policy at St. Jean de Maurienne. Partly from count Sforza, but mere perhaps from other wall informed sources. I gathered that his real aim is to avoid any territorial acquisition by Greece or any other Power in Turkey.   He would favour spheres of influence, and is particularly anxious lest the Straits should fail into the hands of Greece or any Western Power, as Italy attaches special importance to freedom of communication with the Black Sea.Signor ?ecehi,  the Minister of Marine, has recently impressed on the naval attache the importance Italy attaches to Asia Minor as a field for emigration owing to the closing of the United states, and the present unsuitabiiity of the Argentine (whence Italian emigrants are returning) and Brazil. Count Sforza did not expand much on this theme, on which I tried to sound him.

On less immediately Italian questions I have no doubt that count sforza&apos;s policy is to try and harmenize the British and French point of view. Without being definitely, pre-British, our stand point usually appeals to him, but he will not take a line which would annoy the French.

Signor Nitti.

I did not see Signor Nitti and I heard nothing to his credit. He is universally condemned for the weakness of his home policy, which is considered to have landed his country in great difficulties. His lack of legislative output is contrasted adversely with the comprehensive policy of Giolitti. There is a good deal of malignant gossip to the effect that he abused his position and "feathered his nest" and that on his downfall, he left immediately for Switzerland


and made large investments. Giolitti&apos;s entour? state that Nitti is worlding hard, underground to undermine the present Government. Dr. Mattoli was very insistent that recent attacks on Great Britain and France in Italian newspapers (which had entirely escaped my notice) were in reality intended to weaken Giolitti and were inspired by Nitti&apos;s rich friends. Giolitti had sent for the editors and told them they were doing an ill service to Italy. This would not be of much avail, because the papersin question were in financial straits, which enable Nitti&apos;s friends to put pressure on them. Giolitti had no means to combat this. The total sum at Giolitti&apos;s command for secret service, propaganda etc., was 80,000 lira a month. He had no private means. The cost of a single newspaper would he 250,000 lira a month Giolitti had no press. On the other hand I was told at the Embassy that "Il te po?, one of the offending newspapers was run in Giolitti&apos;s interest by, I think, the Banco Commerciale.

Personally I did not observe any marked anti-British current in the Italian press, but I only read spasmodically. Even the Irish news was temperate. Neither was I conscious of any anti-British feeling. On the contrary, I had a distinct impression that the Italians preferred us to the swarms of Americans by whom southern Italy is at present over-run. In this connection Dr. Mattoli told me that ?r. Schwab, the American millionaire had, on the previous day made a similar remark to him. He had replied that the reason was that, while England was saying nothing about Italy&apos;s debt to her, the Americans were always making themselves unpleasant about it. I would remark here that there is a general impression in italy that England would remit Italy, her debt, if America would remit our debt, which undoubtedly tells against Americans popularity.    I encountered hardy any Germans,  but in Rome I was told that German influences are again appearing, and
the naval attache had learned on the day before my arrival in Rome from two gooc sources that a great Italian steel group had been bought up &quot;by persons, behind whom was Hugo   gtinnes.Italy undoubtedly needs capital and will obtain it where she can.    Italian capital is very nervous at recent labourdevelopments anc. is thoroughly scared by the high taxation andthe extraordinarily difficult financial and economic situa-tion.    gignor Giolitti and the faithful Dr. katteli werethe only optimists I met or heard of.Curiously enough the appearance of the people does not give an impression of economic distress.    The wages of theworking classes are good, and, with more than 20 yearsexperience of Itaay?   I obtained an impression of there being less destitution than on former visits.    On the whole there seemed to be fewer beggars.   The principal grievance among thelower classes seemed to be the shortage of maca.roni whichis rationed.    I am told, however,  that the middle-classes are suffering severely from the high-prioes.   Bread is very coarseand good food is very difficult to obtain as every hotel keeperis at pains to explain.    It is stated that the workmen willnot work.    The only evidence I saw of this was that the fisher-men oonfine their operations almost entirely to the ooast,instead of undertaking deep sea fishing as formerly.The housing problem is most acute and I saw no buildinggoing on.    Dr.    attoli said that the Government vould nottaokle it until the price of building material fell.   Atpresent they are only   drawing up plans, and in some casespurchasing sites.   Houses and flats are almost unobtainable.One result i3 that the hotels are crowded with permanentresidents anc. it is extremely difficult to obtain accommoda-tion in Rome,   yven   the ?garquis Imperiali has been unableto obtain a flat.The servant problem is more acute than it was in &quot;Englandat its worst.
The railways anc the roads round the big towns areinctedibly bad.    There are a few really good trunk route trainsde luxe, but the ordinary train service is wretched, badlyadministered and over-staff ed.    I actually saw a short gooestrain of tvelve truoks being hauled by three engines.   Thereason for this excessive power was that some of the wheelsof the trucks did not revolve, but slid along the rails like&quot; &quot;traina broken toy /striking sparks and smoking as they went.    To-one seemed to worry,   as l-&quot;r&apos;* 7-t.G. yells, whom I met, remarkedto me, you could   almost see the decay of civilisation onthe railway.gi nor Giolitti however is making a gallant effort todeal with Italy&apos;s economic difficulties, by increasing taxa-bytion,/cutting down expenditure in every direction,  and by increasing production.    To one who has listened to hisearnest and confident exposition of his policy could fail to wish Italy a happy issue from her difficulties.(Sgd.) M.P.A. HAMKSY.th February,  1921.- 12 -
