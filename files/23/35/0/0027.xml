/NOTES of a Meeting held at 109 downing street held on Thursday, October 28th.1920, at 12, noon..&apos;   PRESENT.The Prime minister mr. Bonar DawSir Robert HomeMr. BridgemanSir David ShackletonMr. Duncan (Goal Controller)Sir Maurice HankeyMr. Thomas Jones.Members of the Executive of the miners federation, with Mr. Smillie as Chairman.THE PRIME MINISTER:   Mr. Smillie and Gentlemen.I felt when we parted last night that we had com^e to thegreatest crisis with which we had been confronted in the courseof our negotiations.     My colleagues and I felt that we couldnot take the responsibility of giving a decision which wouldbreak off negotiations without consulting the rest of our colleagues.     We had no doubt a^all as to the view which theywould take but we felt that they were entitled to be consulted.We have seen them this morning and their view is entirely ours,that we cannot even at the risk of a prolongation of this un-furtunate controversy agree to anything which would leave aloose end to the settlement and leave the question open whichmight in January precipitate a second dispute under very much
worse conditions for both parties, because there would bea feeling of resentment on both sides,     Therefore, wecannot&apos;recede from the position which we took up, that thescale must be one which wotild cover all the reasonable pro-babilities of the next few months during the provisional&apos;monthsperiodo     Five wssks seems to be the outside figure whichhas been indicated for the completion of negotiations fora permanent settlement, and to have an agreement which would provoke a renewed conflict during those five months is onewhich the public would not allow us to enter into.     If we did enter into it there would be a universal howl in con-condemnation of the negotiators on both sides.     Therefore, weadhere to the position which we took up yesterday in refer- -ence to scale.     What we could do would be to recast theformula in such a way as to make it clearer and we have gota proposal of that kind.     Copies will be here in a few minutes, but I can read it to you now.     We make it quite clear on the face of it that we have the same graduationsboth above and below;   there is no distinction at allbetween the scale we applied above the 3/- and the scale whiehwe applied below the 2/-.     There was a suggestion that therewas a bigger gap above than there was below but we make it quite clear that is not the case.     This is the sort offormula that we suggest.     I do not pretend there is any alteration in the character of the proposal^, but merely inthe presentation of it in order to make it clear.     It was open to objection undoubtedly previously - we looked at itafterwards and it seemed on the fact of it as if there were a difference above the scale to that whieh obtained below.We feel that although there is no strength in thein substance, there is 4 strength in the candAfefeea which was put from the point of view of form.     Therefore we suggest-2&quot; (*V^V
an alternative form which we will give you and you canconsider it and see if it meets your views.     I will nowsimply read it out:-SIR ROBERT HORNS:     This is instead of 2 BoTHE PRIME MINISTER:     &quot;lor the purposes of this temporary arrangements the advance referred to shall be automaticallyadjusted on the basis, set out below from the 3rd January,1921, in the light of the results of the five weeks ending18th December, 1920, and similarly from 31st January, and thereafter, every four weeks on the results of the four weeksimmediately following the last preceding test period - butthe Christmas Holiday week shall not be counted in any such period&quot;.        We propose to add here in order to make clear the point raised by MroSmillie, and I believe Mr.McGregor,&quot;Or the New Year week where that forms the period of holidayWe propose to put that in so as to have no misunderstanding.&quot;The basis on which the advance shall be adjusted is asfollows&quot;, now these are the important words &quot;if the weeklyaverage of the proceeds of Export coal during the test periodare maintained at the weekly average of the proceeds ofcapital Export Coal during the September quarter the advanceshall be l/-9       . and 4-gd. respectively&quot;.     There is nochange in the figure by means of which you arrive at the l/-but simply in the way it is put.     &quot;If (after deduction ofthe cost of extra output) they exceed the September figurean additional 6d., 34., and. E^d. respectively will be paid for every complete  288,000 of the excess&quot;.       So the de-termini ng figure will be  288,000 and there will be no difference whether it is above the 2/- or below;   it isexactly the same in. both cases.     We are giving l/- reallyto prevent the output from going down because we are afraid
of the experience of the advance we made he fore,238,000 to 232,000, and we are giving the 1/- rather to encourage the Miners to keep up to that figure.I will distribute this document which you may like toconsider and if you want any information upon detailsthen either the President of the Board of Trade or the goal Controller will explain anything you desire.IB.DUNCAN:   (h) and (d) both come out.SIR ROBERT HORNE:   Both are incorporated in the new form.PRIME MINISTER: The words which I read about the NewYear are being inserted in the new copies.The Prime Minister and his colleaguesthen retired, and the Miners&apos; Representa-tives conferred among themselves.
At this point Sir Robert Home and theCoal Controller rejoined the Representativesof the Miners9 Federation to explain certain points oMRsSMILLIEs   The Prime Minister has mentioned this morningthat it would be five months before our permanent schemefor the regulation of wages was ready.SIR ROBERT HORNEs    As I understood him/1 he said that was the longest period anybody had mentioned.MR.SMILLIE:    In the meantime the Government are anxious toavoid a new wages trouble at the end of this year or thebeginning of next.   We want to avoid that until the permanent scheme is finally adopted.     You have merely altered thescale of figures here to bring out what Mr.Duncan said wasthe real position.   We are all anxious to get output andwe are anxious to get something which we should be ableto recommend to our men.   We do not think that you are dealing fairly with us in the proportion in the event ofour getting a higher output.     Be do not think you are dealing fairly with the wages side in the proportions you have given.   We think you ought to give a higher&apos; proportion to wages than you propoae to give.SIR ROBERT HORNE:     I will tell you what we are doing.   Sofar as we can calculate it we are doing what you proposed when you met the coal owners.     I think you had a document thismorning.     In saying that I am referring merely to the scale of rises.   What you proposed was that yuu should get 2/-for 240,000,000 and thereafter a rise by 6d. for every400,000,000 tons increase.     We, are giving you the sames cale on the increase - Sd. for every 4,000,000 tons of increase.   Where we differ from what you previously askedis that we are giving l/** 0 233,000,000 whereas you asked2/- at 240,000,000. ^
MR. ROBSON:     Will you fix your mind upon the 246,000,000;that is where we are in difficulty In the higher regions.The adjustment of-the proportions &quot;between the. parties conoernedis a little bit to our disadvantage in our judgment.     Cannotyou increase the proportions beyond the 246-, 000,000^SIR ROBERT HORNE:      I am afraid that ^ould be very difficult.I will tell you why.    : We are really in a very embarrassedposition at this moment.      Just before you asked us to cometo see you I was discussing this very question with Mr.Duncan as to whether we should, not be in the position,, onthe figures&apos; we already have-, of being compelled to find some extra money somewhere.     Quite honestly that is my fearwhen you get up to the figures of wages such as we should bepaying at 250,000,000 tons., 3/- extra wage per shift, we maybe at a period when prices are considerably lower,      I was just asking- the Coal Controller the question what fall Inprices would entirely wipe out all our margin for exportpriceso      I have no accurate figure but I am told it would bea very small figure ind.eed in drop in the export prices in-order to wipe out everything that we had.      This would leave &apos;outus with/enough to pay the wages unless we Increased the priceof coal.      In such circumstances I do not think that you canpress us upon that line..     At the moment.! feel that thesituation will be sufficiently embarrassed.     Quite franklyI expect you to keep up output.      I think you will be atthe 252, level very soon, and we shall then be paying 2/-extra per shift - it may be that on 250,000,000 tons weare paying 2/6 per shift and on 254,000,000 tons 3/-a      I donot think you will be long in getting there&quot;,      I shall be surprised if you are not there by the end of this test period,MR. HERBERT SMITH:      I shall be surprised.SIR ROBERT HORNE:     You do not think it will be as much as
that then Mr. Smith?MR. DUNCAN:     The question does not arise.MR. HERBERT SMITH;      I am talking about the December period .&apos;SIR ROBERT HORNE:      Looking to the fact that you are at  &amp; x&amp;&amp;&amp;240,000,000 tons In the first quarter of the year the chancesthat you will be In the higher regions In the last quarterare considerable.      However that may be if there Is any fallin prices I am. afraid we shall be in Queer Street even on thesewages.MR. HERBERT SMITH: if prices did not fall you would be gettina high proportion^SIR ROBERT BORNE: Enough certainly to pay your wages butwe have also to- find something to pay an increase upon theowners &apos; surplus.MR. HODGES:      Would you give consideration to this proposition?The Prime Minister has emphasized over and over again that whatis wanted is an automatic scale so that there would be noclash.     We have agreed with you on the automatic scale fromthe 246,000,000 tons downwards.     We are prepared to agree with you that there should, be an automatic scale from that figureonwards.      The point is as to the amount of the automatic scaleYesterday and to-day you put to us a proposition which saysin effect that for every  1 that you get v-re receive 10/- outof, this figure.-   That is always providing that the pricesremain constant.MR. DUNCAN:     That is right. *
MS. HODGES:Now is it not possible to come to an agreementbetween the b0% of the proceeds which you allocated to us andthe 50% which will go to the Government under this schemedCannot we build.a bridge and say that we will start at the238,000,000 under this new form that you have proposed to usthis morning;    we will start from and use this formula thatfor every 216,000 we get 6de, for every  432,000 we get 1/and so on, instead of it being as you propose now  288,000------instead of our having to say that we are producing  576,000to get  288,000 worth we will be having 0432,000 in order tohave the full advance in wages-,MR. DUNCAN:      Is the point that Mr. Hodges himself-------MR. HODGES:      Instead of having the 50% as you proposed weshall have 75$.      216,000 will give us 6d$     432,000 will give us l/-, leaving you that odd 25% to meet what Is required, topay the owners their increased and to guard yourselves against any dipping in the pool,SIR ROBERT horne:      That percentage would not meet us,     you know.Mr. Hodges, that if there is a drop in the prices at allI am afraid, we  shall be embarrassed in finding the money forthese wages.     What would be a small drop In export prices,looking to the heights to which they have risen, would wipethe whole thing.     That is our difficulty.     We should be inan awful position and in a very short time we should - have togo to the consumer.      The result would be that we must putso much more on the price of your coal,MR. HODGES:      Under my proposal  -SIR ROBERT HORNE:      I am following that perfectly Mr. Hodges;-fejjfe the l/- in the balance^ as it is now; that is l/- at the.338,000,000 line^ wo shall get anoLhoi&apos; S/0-;-   we shall get another2/6 at 250,000,000 - that Is, 3/6 at 250,000,000.
MR. DUNCAN:      Mr. Hodges, are you. keeping in mind this point that even before^ strike the 1/- at 238,000,000 was takingmoney out of the pool.      Now out of the same pool, from whichwe have got to finance the strike as it were, we cannot getthe l/- because there may be nothing there.     We cannot getthe whole l/- if there is a fall in prices on the market.We are guaranteeing the September price: when you say we aretaking all that comes in and we are giving you half that is notaquite true.     We are giving you half if the September price is maintained but if the September price is not maintainedit is our proportion that is going to suffer and not yours.MR. RODGSS: On the other hand if the prices go up you &quot;willhave more.MR. DUNCAN: As the Prime Minister pointed. OT.it if you choose to take the risk of the market that is another matter.MR.  BRACE:      You will not pay until yoti have realised whatever the figure may be.SIR ROBERT HORNE:     Remember, Mr. Brace, thatxskx of that 2/-the first l/- is being given out of the existing pool such asit is..      Supposing you just give us the 238,000,000 outputthat l/- would be taken out of the pool and not out of the rasasproceeds of the export coal.c&amp; - &apos; /v:
MR. BRACE:    What you wish to do is to reserve yourselfaf&quot;si 11st a fall in prices or something of that character which would deolete. the pool.To enable us to pay  the wagesMR. BRACE-;    If the prices remained constant then yourpool fund Is perfectly safe.    Under those circumstancesis.it unfair to ash that If that be so - the financialresult - that in some form or other the workmen should share in it&quot;?MR. DUNCAN:    Will they share in the losses ?MR. WINSTONi    We are on your side now, Sir!SIR ROBERT HORNE:    Yes, I know.MR. ROBSON:    Mr * Duncan,  can you tell me to what extentduring the strike the pool has depleted ?   What are yourobligations during the strike through control ?MR.- DUNCAN:    The pool is being very rapidly depletedbecause you must remember that.we have to pay the men.MR. ROBSON: I wanted to know the extent of your obliga-tions .MR. DUNCAN:&apos; We think  3,000,000 Is a conservative estimateMR. ROBSON:  3,000,000 per week-:. --MR. HARTSHORN:    It would be a saving to the pool if those men were not working \SIR ROBERT HORNE:    It would be a saving to the pool butdetrimental to the country.MR. DUNCAN&apos; It might be a saving to the pool during thestrike, but it might be a greater loss to the pool.after/A
the men had returned.    We are paying all these wagesout of the pool now.    In addition to that you have allthe additional opening-up again - the difficulties which you yourselves have been describing during the last fewdays - in getting the pits Into working order.    Thatcomes out of the pool, which is being actually depleted-SIR ROBERT HORNE:    In the first fortnight of Novemberwe pay not only the Old wage but the additional 2/- aswell,.    That must come out of the pool.    Our embarrass-merits are really very great.MR. HERBERT SMITH:    We are agreed on the 246 millions.There us nothing between us there at present.    It isabove, that yop. people say &quot;you are taking a tremendousrisk.    Seeing that tha-t Is now stabilised,  if thereIs so much risk about It-, why. not say that if theprices go down your people will- be prepared to meet us-after stabilising on the 245 millions,    I am inclined to think it will go up in January.SIR ROBERT ECRNE:    You think so? &apos;   . :MR. HERBERT SMITH:    Yes.SIR ROBERT HORNE:   We are rather of.the opinion thatwe are likely to go down,  judging from all the worldfactors.    Of course, we can only speculate, that isquite true, but we have a very great responsibility in the position-    Quite frankly, I do not feel we couldface it,&apos; MS. DUNCAN:    Supposing the prices went up, then it is all the/Detter for you.MR, HARTSHORN;    Supposing we took the risk of prices
beyond the 246,000,000.MR DUNCAN: You must take the risk below also.-SIR ROBERT HOME; You say TOWe will take the riskabove but not below.&quot;MR DUNCAN: We should have to begin this all overagain.MR SMILIIE: One thing we are anxious about is thatwe want to get the highest output.    If export prices keep up for a time then the salvation of the thing comes from high output.SIR ROBERT HORNE: That is quite right.MR DUNCAN: Although we see no hope of such a thinghappening at the moment, I hope that prices will go up for this reason ** that it will be all the better forthe permanent scheme.    This is precisely what you aretalking about in regard to sharing.   You talked origwinally about having a share out of the pool; that is what you meant; and when you come to your permanent scheme it will he all the better for you if our prices have gone up and not down.   It will be for a very temp-temporary period.MR SMID1IE: The prices cannot possibly keep up.SIR ROBERT HORHE: The whole question is when the dropwill come, and that is what makes us very nervous totell you the truth.MR HODGES: I can see quite plainly in my own minda way out of the difficulty; we want to give the guarantee to the Prime Minister and the Government that there will
be no trouble in our applying for a further Increasebefore a permanent scheme Is ready.    If we can give him that guarantee, is it not within the competence of theGovernment to re-arrange the scale ?MR, DUNCAN: You have t o give a certain number of days to that iMR. HODGES:    Whatever length of time is required to doMR, DUNCAN: We should have to revise the 2/- at presentbecause it would make a difference .SIR ROBERT HORNE: The more we delay in getting a settlement$ the more cur figures are out j all our calculationsnext week-    If that is not done then all these figures are cleaned out and we shall have to start on newfigures altogether, because otherwise we should not beable to meet our obligations *are now starting on a scale mentioned In this paragraph,which, as it were, excludes the 1/-, 6d. and 4-id. fromany advance in quantities at all.    Then you take 288,000 to give you an additional 6d,    We can see ata glance what that means.   We quite see that you willdip into the pool to get the l/-.    Then for every 576,000 you would have to give us  288,000 in value.MR. DUNCAN:    We do not get the  576,000 unless pricesgo up.MR. HODGES:    Could, not we very simply say we knowexactly what amount of money would be involved,- couldthatat the present moment are on thework willbasis that/begin again -MR. HODGES:What new figures would be required ?   Younot we sayy &quot;Well, we will still take the1/- out of the
pool, and the 6d, and. the 4-gd.. respectively, hut forevery additional onal i-32, OOC we get l/-; for  216,000we get 6d,    That Is to say we increase our share ofthe proceeds from a half to three-quarters&quot;.^SIR ROBERT HORNE:    That would mean that you would begetting gn 250 million tons,  3/6d.  extra,  instead ofour figure of 2/6d.    Is that right ?    We readier cannot have that, Mr, Hodges.    That would be Impossible.MR.  DUNCAN:    With the loss of output.SIR ROBERT HORNE: Of. your own original claim of248 millions you are getting 3/-,   We are going to be embarrassed enough, as it is.    I am putting&apos;that honestlybefore you.MR. DIET CAN: It is even more than an embarrassment &apos; forthe period you may be bankrupt.SIR ROBERT HORNE:    That Is quite true.    We have tocarry the weight of this In the House of Commons and before the public.MR. DUNCAN:    It is not as though you could estimateprecisely, when the strike is in progress, what lossyou are incurring.    You cannot tell that,  I should think, for three months at least.MR. BRACE:    I quite understand you must be on the sideof financial  safety with your arrangement.    I understandthat;  to give certain results there would be a marginwhich, If you were assured now,  I feel sure you would let us&quot; share in that.    Cannot you say that given prices which either stand or are increased -which would increasethe pool fund - then over and above this arrangementAt (%
which you are suggesting we shall have consideration,after you know where you stand.MR. DUNCAN:    Mr * Brace, in making this arrangement you have just got a faint hope that prices will not go downtoo far;  if they do net you will he able to reap some-thing.  You say that even if that faint hope Is realisedyou are unable to give us a further sdiare.SIR ROBERT HORNE:    I do. not think, gentlemen, that wereadily can increase this offer.    I am afrdfid you must consider it on the basis of the terms we have put down.Sir Robert Home and the coal controller then retired.
At this point the Prime Minister and hiscolleagues re-entered the Conference Room,MR. SMILLIE:     We have decided Mr. Prime Minister to take a&quot;ballot of the miners at the earliest possible moment onthese terms!&apos;.      It was a question between calling a Conferenceand taking a ballot, and as the former would take some cons Id-enable time we have decided to take a ballot.THE PRIME MINISTER:     Does that mean that you are recommend-ing it to the miners.MR.SMILLIE:     We are going to recommend it, but we have one or two points to suggest.MR.HODGES:       In Clause 1 (b), after the words&quot;earliestpossible moment&quot; we propose to put in the following words&quot;and not later than the 51st March&quot;.T&apos;HS PRIME MINISTER: That seems all right. I think thatis probably an improvement. It simply means you must fixsome date,otherwise this thing might go on for ever.MR.SMILLIE:      As a matter of fact it is in order to getthe coal owners and ourselves together.   You do not want usto go on indefinitely.X. j..lxii    lit i*i a. Li J. *J J-liiJA * yi u sMR. BONAR LAW:     The only point which occur s to me is that .as the coal owners are a party to the agreement whetherthey should be informed,THE PRIME MINISTER: I think we will take the responsibilityfor that.MR. HODGES:      Then there is the insertion of the clauseconcerning the New Year holiday..   ... Vtr y   -
THE PRIME MINISTERS     This must he inserted in cases wheresay, In Scotland and in Lancashire.MR. BRIDGEMAN: There is some little difficulty concerninga difference.THE PRIME MINISTER:      I think you must allow that to beSIR ROBERT HORNE:      I think we might be able to give you a formula to be inserted after the vrords &quot;preceding test period&quot;in 2(b) namely &quot;but the Christmas holiday week shall not be counted in any stich period^ and an adjustment shall be madein those cases where the holiday falls wholly or partly in the New year.&quot;MR. SMILLIE:     Yes.     If xire really agree to the principleit is quite easy to find words, i/ If we are to go back withgoodwill to try and increase output then we do not want tohave anything in the way of victimisation.THE PRIME MINISTER:     We have always given a guarantee inthe case of a strike about that&apos;.     We had some rather badcases during the last railway strike where there had been alittle sabotage, but there has been nothing of that kind here.In so far as. the Government can influence the situationwe can certainly prevent that.     We.have always given thatundertaking in every strike of which I have had experience.MR. HERBERT SMITH:      Then all men will be allowed to returnto work.THE PRIME MINISTER:      If the miners accept it, it is essentialthat there mast be goodwill otherwise you will not get theoutput. - &apos;T.T\the New Year week forms a period of holiday.That is toadjusted otherivise it is very difficult to get a form of words.
MR. SMILLIE: I think the President of the Board of Tradeis going to assist us as far as he possibly can In gettingtrie necessary developments for outputsSIR ROBERT HORNE;     Yes, certainly, that is part of our.policy,,MR. HODGES:     I think that if this agreement Is acceptedthe Government should summon the workmen and the owners to&quot;a joint Committee with possibly a representative of theGovernment to preside over It, so that we can give an earnest of our intention that we are settling down to this responsi-ble and difficult work.     That I think should be an obligation on the Government.      It. might be that we may be able toarrange a meeting ourselves but in the case of disagreementthe Government ought to summon one:&apos;.SIR ROBERT HORNE:      That is quite rightsMR. SMILLIE:     There is the question of increasing theoutput and there is the question of beginning at once toendeavour to get the new wages -running. ^    The two. things aredistinct for the moment, thought the increase of output will be the chief thing.SIR ROBERT HORNE:      Is any body dealing with them?MEo SMILLIE:     There will be a joint Central &quot;Committee setup.because we are going to try to establish local Committees:,but the Joint Central Committee must have some power whicht^e^/feta^e not had up t.o the present time otherwise it will fail in the districts.SIR ROBERT HORNE:-     We will work it out in the best way possible&apos;.THE PRIME MINISTER:      No?; we come to the very important ^
question of publication.     The House of Commons is meeting in half an hour and someone will have to get up and answer questions: as to what has happened.     What Is your suggestion?We must agree about that because it is very important.      Ifthere is to be a settlement made It should be an agreed settlement.SIR ROBERT HORNE:     Are you going to the Trade Union Congressmeeting because they will want to know the result?MR.. SMILLIE:     Ye so the PRIME MINISTER:      The House of Commons will be very anxious to hear the resultflMR. SMILLIE:      I do not think the Trade Union Congress willbe very much interested in those clauses:,MR. BONAR LAW:      It may be desirable to get the Trade UnionCongress over before it is announced.MR. SMILLIE:     We shall send someone to the Trade UnionCongress to say that after serious negotiations we haveultimately arrived at something we could recommend to the merioWe should not go into the clauses at all.THE PRIME MINISTER:     Still, you. can keep it out of to-morrow * s papers, that I am quite certain ofcMR. SMILLIE:      I should be surprised if it Is not in already.THE PRIME MINISTER:      Therefore, it is much better that an accurate account should be given of the terms.     The Houseof Commons is always very jea.lous if news is kept back and -only put in the newspapers1,MB-. SMILLIE:      I think you are entitled to say to the. Houseexactly what has taken place and to say that a ballot Is
being takenQMR, BONAR LAW:     You,w ill have to read out this document&apos;,THE PRIME MINISTER:      But the House will not understand it.MR. SMILLIE:      It is far more dangerous from the point ofwhatview of/the people on both sides will say than what the document itself states.THE PRIME MINISTER:      It must be said in such a. way so as not to make it difficult for the men or for ourselves-&apos;.MR. HODGES:     We will send Mr. Brace to the Trade UnionCongress to explain it clause by clause IMR. SMILLIE:&apos;    it xTOuld be troublesome        someone -%gfexplains^t in one way in the House and. then for one of our people to explain it in a different way elsewhere.SIP; ROBERT HORNE:      That is a trouble which I can foresee.MR. BRACE:      I think it would be best to. read out in theHouse of Commons what we have agreed to.THE PRIME MINISTER:      That will baffle them more than ever,I think that whoever is going to the Trade Union Congressshould meet Sir Robert Horne and they should, agree upon thegeneral lines upon, v/hich the statement should, be made&apos;.MR. SMILLIE:      I do not think the text of this could, usefully be given to the Trade Union Congress-.     What the Trade UnionCongress are interested in chiefly is whether there is any hope of settlement.THE PRIME MINISTER:      The more it is. understood the more I;think the men are likely to, accept   it.SIR ROBERT HORNE:      I think we might say that terms havebeen arranged and that the miners &apos; leaders have agreed to^^. - (
