East..- $H3 PRIMS MIX?ISTSS said that he could not accept that account, of his last interview with tf. patek. What&apos;.&apos;-,h^ said waa that if Poland did hot oako peace, she-wouldteaks war entirely on her own responsibility, and would
have to &quot;bear all the consequences.   He had, however, clearlyindicated his own ^opinion that he -$nought that Poland ought tomake peace, though he obviously, could not dictate Poland&apos;s policy to her0     Aftes? some further discussion as to the paet, thePRIMS MINISTER-said that he thought it was no use discussingthepast ae it might lead to re orimi nation.     What did Poland want atpresent?HsPASEK said that Poland had always been ready for peace and was ready to   discuss peace tferms with the Bolsheviks.The PRIME MINISTER asked if theychad made any approaches to the Bolsheviks recently.HcPATEE replied that the moment was inopportune as thePolish army was retreating,, and to propose peace now would looklike weakness, if not surrender,.   if howeverfl the situation wasstandard!sede the Poles would work for peace.The PRIME MINISTER said that if that was so, there was nothing which the Allies could do for Polandc   If the moment wasunfaveurable far the Poles to seek peace, it was equally unfavour-able for the Allies.   - .M.PAIEK then said that Poland was very anxious to secure-material, not in order to make wars but &quot;because strength was as necessary to the making of peace as it %vas to the prosecution ofwar0   He further added that a leading Polish General had justarrived from Poland, ...The PRIME MINISTER suggested that this General. should seeMarshal POch and Sir Henry V/ileon and go -into the military situation with them*     The firs.t thing, he wanted td^kn&apos;0^ was the truth aboutthe military   situation^.      - -MaPATEK agreed to this.     He then said that he greatlyregretted that Great Britain and supported Denikin and Kolchak,but had not supported Poland to the same extent.The PRIME MINISTER said that this was due to the factthat there had been an Inter-Allied arrangement whereby Prance &quot;^as
to undertake td support Poland,  and Great Britain was to look after Denikin^ Kolehak and Archangel.In eonclusioh, M.PATEK said that he hoped that poland would secure the sympathy and friendship of Great Britain,    AllSJufope was at peace except Poland,  and Poland now requiredsympathy and support;&quot;,:       -The SRITfi^i MIIIISSEB said -that Great Britain had alwayssympathised with Poland and still dids &quot;but that Poland would never get the active sympathy and support of Great Britain solong as she pursued an imperialist policy.    If. Poland was prepared to &quot;build-her future on true nationalism, she would findfull support and sympathy in Great- Britain, hut if- she quarrelledwith Lithuania and with the Czechs,  and tried to annex Butheniansand Germans, Poland would get no sympathy from Great Britain. LetPoland accept true nationalism and not Imperialism as the &quot;basisof its policy, and    ; she -*ould find that Great Britain wouldstick &quot;by her loyally just as she stuck &quot;by her other Allies.Hotel Britannique,Spa.6th July,  1920
