REPARATION. 

2. The Conference briefly discussed the question of reparation.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that Lord Sumner&apos;s opinion was that the question of the distribution of the indemnity among the Allies should be left indefinite for the present, until the respective claims had been more closely examined. Lord Sumner&apos;s view was that whatever proportion was fixed, the French would sooner or later raise objections. Mr. Chamberlain said that he himself was, however, in favour of fixing a definite proportion.

The Lord Privy Seal thought that the French would almost certainly raise objections, whether any proportion were fixed or not.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer pro-ceedlng,stated thnt Lord Sumnor had proposed that wo should submit to the Commission a carefully documentednnd reasoned statement of our claims,     Fe couldkeep in reserve a supplementary list of claims tobe submitted later,, and we could lenve it to thoother Allies to follow our lead..The Prime Minister thought that unless wefixed n proportion, we were ,bound to meet with considerable difficulty.    In his view we could not expect ever to get the whole Indemnity]   but theGermans for a certain number of years would paysomething, and therefore he was in favour of fixing a certain proportion.The Lord Privy Seal agreed and thought thatthe Germnns would pay up to the extent of their ability to do so and the French would realise theabsurdity of submitting impossible demands.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that theFrench proposal was.that the., proportion,. as betweenthe French and ourselves, should be fixed, at 55 to25*.     Our own proposal was that the proportionshould be 50 to 30*     The United States, on theother hand had suggested.that 2 to 1 was a reason-able proportion^     Lord Sumner had, sncter instructionsagreed to accept.f*om-&apos; tihe Prime Minister., ^ the United States pro-posal, f$ the Frencni a*oul.a. also accept, fct*t thej&amp;eft&amp;ll        refnerj^lwThe Prime Minister said that he.was in favourof fixing something definite even.If it wore to our disadvantage-     The Germans might pay fifty or a hundred millions a year, over and above the cost ofthe Army of Occupation, but this would bear no real
relation to the total p.mount the Allies were en-titled to claims     In his opinion there was no, prospect of our getting the last penny out of. Germany *     He did not think, tha t fe5 per centorepresented our rightful dues, but he thought that.it would be better to accept this than to leave the. matter indeterminate *.Sir John Bradbury in reply to a question bythe .Prime Minister4 said that ho thought theGermans -might be able to pay two hundred millions a year,      4,nciw(AiJtt^      *he cost of the Army ofOccupation^The Prime Minister said that there was noquestion at. all, in the minds of anybody who had. visited, the devastated areas of France, as to the...extent of, the damage done;    but the French would always contend that /this had not been sufficientlyrealised by the Allies..The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated thatthe suggestion that some portionhe attached great importance to/any payment by thebs &quot;Germans shM&amp;d/de voted to the reduction of the Inter- --allied..debt, thus making Germany bankrupt ratherthan ourselves.The.Prime Minister said that we were to re-ceive about three, million tons of German shipping.He was afraid, however, that for the first year or so we should not benefit by this.     He inquiredwhether it would not be advisable to give the Frencha share of the shipping, and get them to make areparation to us in kind.Sir John Bradbury agreed that we might behit as regards the shipping, but on the other hand we might score about cattle and other assets to be
paid in kind.      He fully appreciated the importance ofa proper understanding with the French;    and he agreed with lord Sumner that  our rightful claim amounted to atleast three-fiftha of the French claim.The Prime Minister pointed out that the french proposal of $5 to .25 amounted to &apos;45&apos; per cent.     Was it worth while fighting about the differenae?     After all,there was no question as to.the enormous damage fromwhich France had suffered.The Chancellor of the Exchequer was of the opinionthat Parliament would accept the French proposal,  ifthe Prime Minister&apos;s point was clearly put. before them.Sir John Bradbury stated that the. previous discussions had been based on the assumption that the French and our*-sejr^fcs together would take eighty shares of the indemnity,the French proposal being that France should re delve fifty-five shares and -Great Britain twenty^five;    and that weshould negotiate with our Allies as to the disposal ofthe remaining twenty shares I    We had suggested  0 and 30.&apos;The United States suggestion on the other hand had fixedthe proportion,  as between France and ourselves,  at       and28,  giving France and Great Britain together 84 shares insteadof ftO at the expense of the. balance available &quot;far belgium and the other Allies.      He himself had suggested that france should receive -five-eighth &apos; s and ourselves three-eighth &apos; s .M. Loucheur&apos;s present  proposal was to begin by agreeingmerely a ratio between France and ourselves -  say as 11 isto $ .- leaving the ratio which the. aggregate chare of Franceand Great Britain is to bear to the total for subsequentnegotiation with the other Allies.It was agreed:-- That for political, reasons it was desir-able to accept the French suggestion as tothe proportion of the indemnity to be allotted to France and Great Britainrespe ct ively.
C HA IRIAN ship of THEREPARATIONCOMMISSION.. .3a . Tho Chancellor of the Exchequer said thatas regnrds the Chairmanship of the Commission,M;.&apos; Clemenceau nr.s opposed to having a minister in&apos; the Choir, IB1 hiirretan-Viwtr-thoro -was no objection to having a FrenchChr.chairman so long as his rights were clearlylimited and defined.(The Chancellor of the Exchequer thenhanded to Ministers present copies ofa Draft prepared by the Treasurydefining   ho powers of the Chairman).(Append&apos;!?. /&apos; &quot;    *-Experience showed that when- a Frenchmanwas In the Chair he generally exceeded his powers, or embarrassed his Committee by hisIndiscretions. and was Inclined to be biasedwhen he submitted the views of his&apos; Committeeto the Peace Conference. .
SIR JOHN BRADBURY thought that if the French and ? could agree as to our respective shares of indemnity, the question of the nationality of the Chairmanship of the Commission became a matter of much less importance. He understood that the United States were still very keen on having an American as Chairman.

THE PRIME MINISTER, said that he inclined to M. Clemenceau&apos;s view that an American Chairman from an exaggerated sense of justice, might, he disposed to take a, somewhat pre-?

SIR JOHN BRADBURY thought that if an American were in the chair the French Representative and ourselves Could mitigate any possible, pro-German bias on the part of the Chairman. The Americans attached great importance to equal authority being reserved to all the delegates, the Chairman being merely the presiding Delegate at the Meetings of the Commission.

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER suggested that he might interview M. Loucheur and say to him that this question had been discussed with the Prime Minister and his colleagues, and they were of opinion that we could come to an amicable arrangement with the French about the shares of the indemnity to be paid to the two Nations respectively. As regards the Chairmanship we agree that he should, not be a Minister. In respect of his functions we submitted certain draft proposals. Was M. Loucheur prepared to accept this definition of his duties? Further, we were disposed to accept the French proposal that the reparation, as between the French and ourselves, should be fixed at 55 and 25; and we suggested that the French and ourselves might negotiate with the other Allies about their share.
. THE -PRIME ilIllISIElv emphasized- the; Importance cf settlingup all outstanding questions&apos; with&apos; the French- in the firstInstance,,.   As- regards1 the Army&apos; of Occupation&apos;,  the Frenchmust agree that &quot;the Chairman should pay fall costs &quot;both tothe French and our seizes, having regard fro the fact- that theBritish soldier was paid at a very much higher rate than theFrenchman,,    Re thought we might state that in our opinion the fair reparation was two. to one, tut if the French would agree to full costs for- the Army of Occupation of the Frenchand ourselves being defrayed by the Germanswa would accepta reparation of 55 to 25.SIR JOHL-i BKaDBURY suggested that as a large portion ofthe business of the Commission would have to be done inCommittees, it might be possible, if thought&apos; desirable, toarrange that  (as in the ca.se of our own House of Commons)the Deputy Chairman -of the Commission should be Chairman of committees.    Such a Deputy Chairman would have past powersand might be a valuable /counterpoise to a&apos; French Chairman.THE PlvIME MINISTER thought that this wasv relativelyspeaking, an unimportant oonaideration.: It was /agreed that the Chancellor 6f the exchequer should -interview M, Loucheur at once and ap. roach- him on the lines that At. Chamberlain had suggested.,(At this, point the Chancellor of the Exchequer andSir John Bradbury withdrew).&apos;74;S7AI1A &apos;&apos;&apos;--&apos;-&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&quot;4.      THE PKIME iillilBTER said that, he wished now to- discuss theauestion of coal v/hich&apos; had been-raffed at the Inter-allied conference held that morning.:      .       -   - - .&apos;; :- .- (At this point Mr. Duncan, the Coal Controller andMr.:,&apos;, Lee of the Board of Trade joined theConference i.
THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD (F  TRADE said that the positionhrd been rendefrod^rruch-TTKire^xllffi^rult as a result. of the debate which had boon hold at the House of Commons&apos; the pre-vious eveningo   -He,-himself^ saw no solatXoir-of the financialside of the question.unless the l/2d.limitation of profitsriore imposedoTHE PRIME MINISTER enquired whether it was possible for us   -to do anything to assist the French in this matter.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD CP TRADE said that at present theFrench were getting half our total export of eoal, that isto say they were receiving 17 out of 54 million tonse    Theaverage ^rice they were paying was 62/6d* a ton,wfeieh wasabout 1$/- a ton less than other Nations8TBft PRIME MINISTER said that he had received the previous evening and early that morning an Influential deputation of mine owners and miners 0 who had represented that the main difficulty in regard to the output of coal, was the. congestion of traffic^ and they had reported that the exports from various Welsh ports had diminished by some millions of tons for this reason^THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD CF TRADE said that the main diffl-culty In regard to coal was the question of shipping0THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that we should tell the French that we proposed?-(a) To set up at once a Government committee consisting cf the Goal Control lea?, the Ministerof Labours the Food Controller, the ShippingController* and the Minister of Transport, to investigate closely the reasons for the presentcongestion^(b) Local Committees who would endeavour to inducemerchants to pay higher coastal freights Insteadof waiting for conveyance by rail whore the rates are at present considerably lowersThis9 he thought, would be a fairly good answer to the Frenchso far as quantity was concerneda
THE COAL CONTROLLER agreed that everything depended uponshippingoTHE PRIME MINISTER said that, what the French Representativesought to do on their return to France was to state in the newspapers that satisfactory arrangements had boon made inregard to coal and thai so many more million tons had been promised^THE S^Ftf) PRIVY SEAL pointed out that America might per hlgher:for our coal than the French In which case our exports wouldbe diverted to the United States,,THE COAL CONTROLLER, reported that his Department had pressed the Shipping Controller to relinquish more shipping for theexport of coaloTHE PRIME MINISTER said that ho had been informed that therewas some 14ft-, ships now lying idle In the Bristol Channel; thisho understood was largely due to the incompetence of certainHarbour. Trust Authorities in WalesiTHE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE said that one of theprincipal reasons militating against the export of coal wastho difficulty experienced in getting the dockers to work,,..THE LORD PR; IVY SEAL suggested that tho French Representativesnow in this country should be informed that wo should make no definite promises until the coal question had been morethoroughly thrashed out In British Parliament,, .(The Conference finished at 5*30 p.m.)
