The Conference had before them a personal telegram to the British Prime Minister from the Prime Minister ofCanada (Appendix) suggesting, inter alia, that before theImperial Conference in June next it would be an advantage if a representative, of the Canadian Government were toget into touch with the new United States administrationwith a view to ascertaining its view regarding the renewal of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance.     The telegram added that sir Robert Borden had intimated his willingness to undertake this task.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said he hoped the Government would not place their foreign policyin the hands of a representative of the Dominions in a vitalmatter of this kind.      The question of the renewal, of thisAlliance was being explored by the Foreign Off ice , theCommittee of Imperial Defence and other bodies and by Junenext much material would be available to assist the Govern-ment in coming to a decision.     He hoped that the cabinet would not wicxs rush to the conclusion that the Alliancemust be dropped because the Dominions did not want it.There was much to be said for continuing the Alliance though he would not now elaborate the arguments in favour.     Hewould only mention that Sir A. Geddes thought the Allianceshould be renewed.The Secretary of State for the Colonies expressed thehope that the Government would treat a great Dominion likeCanada with consideration in this matter.     He suggestedthat a telegram should be sent to the effect that theBritish Government fully realised the gravity of the situation that the Dominions had a special interest in the matter andthat naturally no steps would be taken without them, and
suggesting that Sir Robert Burden might &quot;be   fullyinstructed with the views of the Canadian Cabinet andthen come over to this country to discuss the question.It would then be possible to consider the advisability of opening up the question with the United States.The Conference agreed --(1)   That the Prime Minister should draft a reply on the lines suggested by the Secretary ofState for the Colonies for considerationby Lord Curzon and Mr,Churchill;( 2)    That the draft should include a referenceto the material which was in course of preparation by His Majesty&apos;s Government^(3)    That the reply as agreed should be forwarded to the Canadian Government; . .(4)    That the Secretary of State for the colonies should inform the Prime Minister of Australiaof the action that was being taken._Wb.iteh.all Gardens,  S.W.18th February, 19 21.
APPENDIX.PARAPHRASE TELEGRAM.        The Governor-General of Canada tothe Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Received, 15th February 19 21).February 15th.     Most Secret.     Following for Prime minister from my Prime Minister.     Begins:     Private and Personal and secret.     The question of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance whichI assume will be decided at the proposed meeting of primeMinisters in June has been considered carefully in Cabinet andit may be useful to let you have, for consideration of your government, our views.Every possible effort should, we feel, be made to find some alternative policy to that of renewal.     Admitting thatin the past the Alliance has been useful it seems truenevertheless ,thet conditions have been so altered that thedefence motives no longer hold while the objections have greatly increased.      It is unnecessary at the moment to elaboratethese points but I would emphasize the need of promoting good relations with the United States.      In view of her tendency towards abandonment of attitude of isolation generally hertraditional special interest in China which is as great as oursand of the increasing prominence of the pacific *as a scene ofaction there is a danger that a special confidential relationship between ourselves and Japan concerning that region to which shewas not a party would come to be regarded as an unfriendlyexclusion and as a barrier to an English speaking eoncord.We believe consequently that we should try to attain in another way our objects in the Par East.      Specifically we shouldterminate the alliance and at once endeavour to bring about aconference of Pacific Powers - that is Japan, China, the UnitedStates and the British Empire represented by Great Britain,Canada, Australia and Hew Zealand - for the purpose of adjustingFar Eastern
Far-Eastern and pacific questions.     Such a straightforwardcourse would enable us to end the alliance with good graceand would reconcile our position in respect of China andthe United States.      It will be a practical application ofthe principles of the League of Nations.      Should it eventual*-ally result in a working Pacific concert the gain toBritish-iimerican relations is obvious.It seems in any case highly important to know inadvance of the June meeting what is possible in thisdirection in order that the whole problem may then be fairly considered.     we suggest accordingly that a repres-representative of the Canadian Government should get in touch withthe new President and his Secretary of State as soon aspossible after their inauguration and discover throughinformal confidential conversations whether any such policyis feasible.     For this purpose I would nominate Sir robert borden who is willing to act.This method from all (group omitted) seems most appropriate first because the concern of the PacificDominions in question   is in reality more vital than thatof the other parts of the Empire and second because theproposal if put forward by Canada seems best calculated to(group undecipherable) Washington.     We attach importanceto the idea putting it forward as loophole $9 a Pacificconference.I should be grateful for your views.     Ends.DEVONSHIRE.
