F^TP.&quot;RATTONS. (l) With reference to Cabinet 11 (SI), Conclusion 1, theCabinet had a short discussion .in regard to one of the^ sanctions adopted by the Allied Conference against Germany,whereby the Allied Governments would collect a percentage ofthe purchase-money to be paid by importers of German goods.It was agreed  Thatj  if possible, the legislation requiredto confer the necessary powers on the Gov-ernment should be introduced cn the following day,, and should be entitled &quot;The german reporation (Recovery) Bill&quot;.ARRANGEMENTS (2) With reference to Cabinet 67 (SO),  Conclusion 1 and consequent ONCESSATION OF   Appendix II, th6 Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by&apos;theMINISTRY OPSKIPPING. Shipping Controller dealing with the liquidation of the workwhich would still be outstanding cn the 51st March, when theMinistry cf Shipping is to come to an end (Paper C.P,-S598.) ,and a Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty objectingto the proposal of the Ministry of Shipping that the AdmiraltyTransport Department should not revert entirely to the Admir-alty (Paper CPs-2658) .The Shipping Controller, in summarising his proposals,stated that it would probably take about two years to wind upthe work of the Ministry of Shipping in its various branchesof Finance, Reparation, Ship Management and Transport.    TheFinance Branch was at the moment dealing with about  750,000per week, and had very heavy responsibilities to discharge.Most of the work of the Reparation Branch would be terminatedby July next,    It is expected that about 2.50 vessels willremain at the end of March in charge of the Ship ManagementBranch.,    The estimated staff on April 1st.  for the whole cfthe Ministry would be about 679..    In his view there shouldbe in future a Parliamentary Secretary attached to a . Depart-ment of the Government, whose special concern it should be to watch British mercantile interests.    This was a proposal which would meet with the support of shipowners and of seams-who would like to. see their interests concentrated and notdispersed as they were be lore the War.    If the adoption.of
this proposal were not -possible, it might be w^rth whileconsidering -whether the Government ought not to combinethe Mercantile Marine Department - of the Board of Trade andthe Transport work of the Ministry of Shipping with theDepartment of Overseas Trade.    On the question of the oilersand colliers for the service of the Navy there was no dis-agreement between him and the Admiralty,The First Lord of the Admiralty stated that his Departmenwas strongly opposed to the transfer from the Admiralty ofthe military and naval transport work which had always been mainly carried out by Naval Transport Officers,    The provi-sion of military transport by the Director of Transports onbehalf of the War Office had always worked with great smooth-ness and good-will in the past,, and there was no desire forany departure from this plan.    In the view of the First Lordit was wrong in principle that a Department like the Boardof Trade, which was responsible for the supervision of theinterests of the mercantile marine,  should also be entrusted with the work of chartering and managing Government vessels.Such a plan would have the same objection as entrusting themanagement of factories to the Home Office, which was responsible for the observance of the Factory Acts,The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to the addendum tothe Shipping Controllers Memorandum, in which it was suggested that Sir Joseph Maclay should be authorised to act withcertain experts,named by him, as a Committee for control and consultation with regard to all matters which had been inany way connected with the Shipping Ministry till the conclu-sion of war responsibilities, the Shipping Controller tocontinue to have access direct to Ministers, as in the past,,for instructions and advice.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries stated that inhis opinion it would be desirable that the Fisheries work ofhis Department should be handed to any Department appointedto look after the general interests of the Mercantile Marine.
aVj*Dr&quot; It would be difficult to differentiate between ordinarymerchant vessels and fishing vessels, and if the new Dr-lj I pertvent were to be a branch of the Board of Trade it shouldbe rerrerc.bered that that Department, already possessed con-siderable fishery powers, especially in connection with theadministration of international Fishery Conventions.The Cabinet agreed  (a)  That one Government Department should beappointed not only to.liquidate all warwork but also to be charged in the future to look after all Government shipping workand the general Interests of mercantile shipping in time of peace (having ever before it war possibilities) and that suchDepartment should be affiliated to theBoard of Trade;    and that the question ofthe transfer of the -fisheries to this De-partment shoxnld be further considered:(b.) That a Committee shoiuld be set up for control and consultat/een with regard toall matters which have bsen in any way-connected with the Shipping Ministrytill the conclusion of war responsi-bilities, with Sir Joseph.Maday as chairman:(c) That Sir Joseph Mac!ay should continue tosuperintend the sale of ex- enemy ships andto exercise the final authority in suchs ales:(d) that the management of Admiralty-ownedoilers and colliers should rose with theBoard of Admiralty, and that the FirstLord should examine the possibility offurther economies in the employment ofoilers and colliers..felLL PROVIDING      (3) &quot;With reference to Cabinet 67 (20), Conclusion 1 andFOR CESSATION .     ^ .OP MINISTRY OF Appendix II, the Cabinet had before them a draxt of a Bu.1-MUNITIONS AND        &quot;IINI-STRv OF       to make provision mr the cessation of the Ministry of touni--shipping. . - &apos;      0,QoAtions and the Ministry of Shipping (Paper 0,P.-2680)..The Cabinet agreed  To refer the draft., the principle of whichhad already been approved, to the HomeAffairs Committee for examination priorto its introduction in the Rouse of Commons.THANKS OF (A) The Cabinet desired to place on record their deepCABINET TO .   ,SIR JOSEPH       appreciation of the inestimable services rendered to theMAC LAY AND HIS &apos;. , ...ASSISTANTS.      country by Sir Joseph Ma clay, and their sense of the remarkable powers of organisation he had shown throughout-3-
ADAhis term of office, and especially in some of the greatt - *&apos;. ,^ crises of the War.The Cabinet also expressed their recognition of the valuable services of Colonel Leslie Wilson at the Ministry:of Shipping,  and asked Sir Joseph Maclay tc convey to theband of voluntary workers.he had gathered round him thethanks of the Cabinet for the unselfish devotion they had shown in the service of the State,The Cabinet noted with satisfaction that sir JosephMaciay and sore o^ his experienced coadjutors were willingto continue their assistance for sore tire under the new arrangements now made with the Eoard of TraderSAFEGUARDING (5) With reference to Cabinet 11 (21), Conclusion 3, thebp INDUSTRIESEILL, Cabinet continued their consideration of the draft of the safeguarding of Industries Bill  (Paper CP.-2640),  and agreedto the following amendments:-(a) Clause 2 (5) __line^l.6.:    substitute &quot;generalefficieney&quot; for &quot;State&quot;:-(b)   &quot;Cost of production&quot; should be retainedas the criterion of dumping., as this wasthe phrase used in the Prime Minister&apos;1 spledge of November, 1918, and by members to their constituents:(c) Omit Clause 9   (2) dealing with &quot;articlescultivated11-, as it would lead to misrepresented-sentation and to charges that the taxation of food was aimed at:(d) Add to Clause 3 a provision limiting theapplication of the Bill &quot;to three yearsinsofar as it dealt with effects of depreciation of foreign currencies.Subject to the above and any consequentialamendment s,  the Cabine t authorising ed theintroduction of the Bill.The Secretary of State for India wished it to be recorded that he agreed with the Lord Privy Seal that theBill was a most unsatisfactory Bill, would be open to verydamaging criticism from all sides of the House,  and that-the main justification for proceeding with it was that itwas better than nothing.
-    148BOARDS.       (6) -Vith reference to Ko-s Affairs Committee 46   Conclusion.3,  the Cabinet had before then, a Mmvorandur. by the Ministerof Labour (Paper 0.1.-2501), a Note by the Chancellor oi theExchequer (Paper C.1,-2 537) and a Resolution of the ImperialCommercial Association (Paper CP.-2510), dealing vithproposals for continuing the work of establishing trade boards.The Cabinet were reminded that on November 25, 1919,they had approved the expenditure of a sum of  20,000 on additional temporary staff for the purpose of establishingTrade Boards to cover those trades in which ho machineryexists for the effective regulation of wages.    This sumwill shortly be  exhausted, and authority was now asked fora further  25,000 for the work of investigation during thecurrent year.    It had been hoped that the original sum wouldhave been sufficient to provide for the  establishment of100 Trade Boards, but, o&quot;&quot;&quot;ing to the complexity of many ofthe trades, only about half the number had been dealt with.Tha Government had from timp to time committed itself to thepolicy of extending Trade Boards, and to arrest the :vork now would not only involve the dismissal of a number of ex-c officers engaged on the work but would also lead to theGovernment being charged with neglecting the least protectedclasses of industrial workers.It was pointed out, on the other hand, that such acriticism could not be sustained.    Most of the sweatedindustries had been covered,  and the extensions authorised by the Trade Boards Amendment Act, 1918,  dealt rather withtrades where th-re was no effective organisation and wherethe Minister had reason to think wages were inadequate.Further, the economic condition of tho depressed tradeshad beer, profoundly altered by the *Var and had renderedregulation by the state less necessary.    It was, indeed,doubtful whether they fulfilled the conditions laid down
in the amending Act.    Complaints against the setting upof new Boards, as now contemplated, were very widespread,especially in the distributing trades, where it was heldtheir extension would lead to great administrative diffi-culties and to irritation not only among the employers butalso among tho employed whom it was sought to protect.The Cabinet were informed that a Question was to beasked in the House of Commons on the following day on thissubject, in which particular mention was made of the staffof the Ministry of Labour who would shortly be dismissedunless a further Treasury grant were forthcoming.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Minister of Labour should announce that,  in view  of the econ-omic and financial situation of thecountry,  the Government did not see their way at present to an extensionof Trade Boards, and regretted the consequent necessity of dismissing someof the staff who had been engaged on trade Board work:(b) That no further extension of trade boards to new industries should beundertaken by the Ministry of Labourwithout the prior sanction of theCabinet.
jf^mjjF^      ^ The telnet had h - fore them a oeirrt :&amp;^randuffiby.,teiTEES;BUREAUX ANDEXCHANGES.President of the Board of Education and the Minister ofLabour dealing with certain difficulties which have arisen in connection with juvenile employment (Paper CP.-2601).The Cabinet were informed that the work of advisingan  helping boys and girls as they left the elementary schoolwas at present being done partly by Juvenile Advisory Commit-tees whose powers were derived from Regulations made underthe Labour Exchanges Act,  1909,  and by Choice of employment committees who derived their authority from the Choice o?Employment Act, 1910, worked under the local Education Author-ities.    Difficulties had arisen from this divided respansi-bility.    There had been an agreement drawn up in 1911 overthe joint signature of the President of the Board of Educatioand the President of the Board of Trade, but it had failed tosecure the required co-ordination, and it was now imperative that some adjustment should&amp;e made which would assign responsibility-and ability to a single authority, locally and centrally,/whichwould at the same time ensure the close co-operation of thelocal Education Authorities with the Employment Exchanges.In the view of the Board of Education the cabinet should lay down the principle that in cases where a localEducation Authority has  adopted the Choice of Employment Actthat authority should be regarded as the sole authority and should be responsible for the advisory work on chiidreiisemploye ent.    If this principle were recognised, a committee could be set up to devise the best way for securing co-operation with the Labour Exchanges..Prom the point o^ vi^w of the Treasury it had to beremembered that where the local Education Authority func-tionrd it shared the eipense with the Treasury, whereas inthe case of the Labour Exchanges the whole of the financial burden tell on the Exchequer,It was ureed on behalf of the Ministry of Labour thatir tv^re to be an enquiry at all, the Committee should
.15 j.be unfettered and should not be tied in advance by the^ -recognition of the above principle.    It was important, incoming to a decision, to have in mind the fact that theUnemployment Insurance Act has cast upon the officers of. ..  the Ministry of Labour very responsible duties in eonneo-.   .,. tion with the paywent of benefit,  to which juveniles becameentitled as insured persons at the age of 16.The Cabinet agreed  To refer the. dispute to the Secretaryof State for India,  the Minister ofLabour and the President of the Boardof Education, who should bear in mind the Treasury and Insurance aspects ofthe problem,  and should only refer thematter again to the Cabinet in case of disagreement.MTTLEFIELD (8) With reference to Cabinet 45 (20), Conclusion 4,  theMemorials .Cabinet had before then&apos;, a Memorandum by the First Commis-sioner of Works on the subject of Battlefield Memorials(paper C,P,-2291) and a Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor War, covering the Report of the National BattlefieldsMemorial Committee (Paper 0,P.-2642).The Earl of Midleton, the Chairman of the latter Com-mittee, and the Adjutant-General, attended the meeting ofthe Cabinet.The question at issue was as to whether, in view ofthe general dernand for economy&apos; and the. feeling in the Houseof Corrmons in favour of restricting&apos; expenditure, the total sum. allotted  ( 300,000) and, more particularly,  the sumassigned to the Ypres Memorial, should not be reconsidered.After, a full discussion the Cabinet agreed  (a) That the sum of  100,000. required for theBritish share of the cost of the YpresMemorial should be granted:(b) That a sum of  100,000 should be allotted to be divided between the Royal Navy andthe Army for the other Memorials, in theproportion of  60,000 to the Army and 40,000 to the Navy:(c) That the Committee should advise the cabinet as to the best method of utilising the sumof  60,000.referred to in (b).    They should consider, inter alia.,  the following pro-posals, which were suggested at the meeting:-
 9O hi(i) A Memorial in Paris, which might perhaps bo a.replica of the ^bite-hall Cenotaph, and which shouldrecord the total of British casual-ties.    This  should be conditional on the French Government granting asatisfactory site in a conspicuousposition in the Capital:(ii) A Memorial in Gallipoli, in regardto which the Committee should get into touch with the Australian andNew Eealand Governments, with a viewto a joint Memorial, if possible, at.the entrance to the Dardanelles.(d)  That the Admiralty should consider the sug-gestion to erect.a striking monument on DoverCliffs, to be seen from ships passing up and d o wn t he Channel.STATE (9) Th^ Cabinet heard a statement on the Irish situationIRELAND.from Lord Midieton, who advised the Cabinet that if an attemptwere made at present to put the Government of Ireland Act.into operation in the South o^ Ireland it would be impossibleto have a free vote or a real contest in the elections, whilethe institution of a norinated Council in place of a Parlia-ment would prejudice the  future usefulness in Irish governmentof those who might accept service on it.Ih r*ply to a question by the Prime Minister as to how long the elections in the South should be put off, LordMidleton stated his grounds for thinking that no date couldbe assigned until the resistance cf the rebels in large dis-tricts of the South and wast, which had recently increased,had been overcome..  .  ,2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,March 8,  1981. .
