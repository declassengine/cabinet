(l) The Prime Minister ceil that he felt sure his col-CP Mr WALTERXiOriQ AND leagues would share his regret at the resignation of MrLORD MILNER.Walter Long, who was not only very popular and highlyrespected, but was one cf the oldest living P^liemenivariane&quot;and a Minister with very great and varied experience ofpublic life.   Mr Long*s illness had prevented him from taking an active part in Cabinet business during recent months, and the Prime Minister suggested that he should write to Mr Long oonveying the regret cf the Cabinet at his resignation, wishing him a speedy recovery, and expressing the hope that he might doire day rejoin his colleagues whenhis health was restored.He also proposed to write in similar terms to lord milner, whose vast experience and distinguished publicservice had been of such assistance to his colleagues and himself, and whose loss would be Very much felt.The Cabinet unanimously requested thePrime Minister to write to Mr Long andLord Milner, as proposed.
(2)   With reference to Cabinet 62 (20), Conclusion 4,and Cabinet 1 (21) i OoaioZaiEKlon 2, the Cabinet had tindereor^idaration a Report of ate Interdepartmental Committeeon the scope and organisation of the proposed Middle FasternDepartment (Paper C.P.-2&amp;*-5) , and also a Memorandum by mr churchill, when Secretary of State for &quot;Jinx (Paper C.P.-2571)covering various telegrams which had passed between him andSir Percy Cox.The Cabinet were informed by the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies (Mr Churchill)- that the interdepartmental committee had carefully surveyed the whole field, and had arrived at unanimous conclusions.    In his view, no eonsist-ent Arab policy wa3 possible unless the Minister responsiblewas glv^n effective control of all Arabian questions.    Onthe other hand, he recognised that in the case of an Independent State like the Heiaz, which had relations with foreign powers, it was necessary that the administering department should work in the closest co-operation with the ForeignOffice.    In short, he would strongly press for the right to initiate and regulate policy in Arabia.   With regard to thequestion of the Arabian Gulf% the Committee had agreed thatit would be extravagant to set up an entirely new Adminis-tra^ion, and had recommended that the Resident at Bushireshould, for the purposes o*&quot; the Arabian littoral, be an Agerof the Colonial Office, and for other purposes should con-tinue to be the Agent of the India Office.    Aden pr sentedno difficulty, while in the case of Kurdistan it was pro-posed that this district should fall within the sphere offho new Department, and he contemplated its re-organisation as a friendly State providing a barrier against Turks and russians.    Some such re-organisation would, Indeed, be essential if a?--at Britain was to continue to administerMesopotamia under the Mandate.    Similarly, Trans-Jordaniawould have to be brought under the new Department.Turninrr to Mesopotamia, the Secretary of State for the
Colonies inforeed the Cabinet that if the British forces were substantially reduced it right be necessary to con-aider a change in the Military Coarand, but he did not pro-pose to raise this issue at the moment.    The imperativeneed for economy in Mesopotamia had received his very careful attention, and he thought that as from 1922-2 3 itmight be possible to administer the country at a cost tothe British Fxohmquer     &apos; net exceeding . 7,000,000 per annum-.Having undertaken the burden of the Mandate,  it would beshameful if Croat Britain thr^w the Mandate aside without making an effort fo set up an Arab Administration in theplace of the Turkish Government which she had destroyed.In order to obtain the latest information, he proposed tomeet Sir Herbert Samuel, Sir Percy Cox, General Haldane,and the various Commissioners, in Egypt,  and he would liketo have Cabinet approval for this visit.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointedout that the decision of the Cabinet had only contemplatedplacing the mandated territories in the Middle East underthe new Department, and that the prcposals now b- fore theCabinet involved a considerable extension of this decision.He emphasised the very serious difficulties- which wouldcertainly arise -if the proposal that in future the ColonialOffice should have the right of initiating and controllingall Arabian volley was adopted.    It would be quite impossi-ble to transfer the King of the Hejaz, who was an Independentd -Sovereign, a signatory of the Treaty of Versailles and auember of the League of Nations,   f;cm the Foreign Office tothp Colonial Office.    Moreover, questions such as the choice of an Arab ruler for Mesopotamia raised issues in inter-national politics of the first magnitude, and he could not contemplate a situation where His kaiesty&apos;s Government mightbe committed by the Colonial Office to a definite policywithout the knowledge and consent ofthe Foreign Office,which policy would be brought before the latter Department
at a l&amp;te stage ^&amp;d after tke critics 1 decisions iu*d beentaken.In the course of the ensuing discussion it was suggestedthat a Cabinet Committee might be set up for the discussion of inter-Departmental affairs between the Foreign Office, the Col-onial Office and the India office, and that it was important that whatever Minister was responsible for Middle Eastern affairs should t&amp;ko over the exeoutive functions formerly vested in theMiddle-Eastern Committee.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve generally the recommendationsoont&amp;ined In the Report of the Interdepart-mental Committee on the Soope and Organisa-iion of the Middle Eastern Department (paper cp.-2545), on the understanding  (i) That this approval involved nomodification of the present arrangements, under which the revenues of tho Government ofIndia bear a portion of middle eastern expenditure:(ii) That the Committee^ proposals in so far as they affect&quot;theGovernment of India and its offi-oors should, before being putinto force, be communicated toand approved by the Governmentof India:(b) That the Secretary of State for foreign affairs and the Secretary of State forthe Colonies should consult togetherwith a view to reaching a working agree-ment on the question of the initiation anddevelopment of Arabian policy:(o) That the Secretary of State for the colonies should bo authorised to visit Egypt in theearly part of March next for the purpose of consulting with tho British Authorities inPalestine and Arabia, as proposed:(d) That the question of making a suitablegrant-Im-aid for Mesopotamia after thepresent evacuation of the main body ofthe troops should be postponed for fur-ther consideration.(q) That the question of making some public announcement of the change of name andstyle of the Colonial Office should befurther considered by the Cabinet at anearly date.-3 4-

NOTES OP A CONFERENCE HELD AT 10 Downing Street,  S.W.on 15tb FEBRUARY 19 21 at 11.0 a.m.PRESENT:-The Prime Minister ( In the Chair)Mr. Bonar Law:Lord Curzon;Sir Hamsr Greenwood:Sir John Anderson:General Tudor:Mr.  Thomas Jones (Acting Secretary).1.      THE PRIME MINISTER asked General Tudor to be present at the House of Commons during the Debate and Address that afternoon.2.      THE PRIME MINISTER said that on the whole the opinionof the Cabinet was in favour of refusing publication ofthe Strickland Report.      It would be helpful if he could say that this was a private report; that indiscipline hadbeen proved and suitable action had been taken.The prime Minister then proceeded to cross-examine GeneralTudor on the facts connected with the burnings at Cork,with special reference to any subsequent disciplinary action taken in the case (a) of the men,  and (b) of theColonel in Command.GENERAL TUDOR said that he had not received the finalreports before leaving Ireland last night, but he believedthere were about seven or more men unfit to be in the
Service end about twenty others ought to be got sway frombad influences.      The seven had not been dismissed, butthey had been  &apos;run in&apos;  for other charges at D unman way.Four of them were accused of robbing a Bank.     The K Company,to which all these men belonged, was being re-organised bygetting rid of these men.THE PRIME MINISTER stated that these men ought tobe dismissed immediately and that he could not go to theHouse of Commons and admit that they were still wearing theKing&apos;s uniform.GENERAL TUDOR stated that it could not be said thatthey were dismissed as they were to be tried by court martial.t rvy 5*.-...-s *&quot; / *.oj i -&apos; - y -It was pointed out that they would m0fc e^a^ettrial for robbing the Bank, which was a civilian offence.GENERAL TUDOR said it had not been possible to identify any one particular person as guilty of the corkburnings.      He had himself interrogated the Company,THE PRIME MINISTER said that he wanted to be able tosay in the House that it was very difficult to get evidence in Ireland;    that the atmosphere was one in which no-one was willing to give anybody away, either on the Government sideor on the Sinn Fein sides    there was a certain numbersuspected of acts of indiscipline and they had been dismissed;a certain number had been dispersed to other Companies.The Prime Minister then cross-examined General Tudoras regards the conduct of Colonel Latimer.GENERAL TUDOR said that the burnings took place at  .30 and the Colonel had taken charge of his men at 10 o&apos;clock.Latimer denied that his men were implicated in the burning.They were, on the contrary, doing their utmost to put out thefires.      He was with his men all night.THE PRIME MINISTER:    The report I had was that hewas billetted away from his men.GENERAL TUDOR:      The accommodation was of a verytemporary character in Cork.      Servants were living with the2.
Cadets.     Latimer could not get quarters for himself foren Office so the Deputy Constable allowed him to work at the Police Barracks and he lived in an hotel close by.He was there when the lorries came to him to report fororders.      The bombing started at 300 yards off and he wentand paraded his men.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that it was a veryserious situation for the Colonel to be away from his menin what was,  in effect, a war area.SIR HAMAR GREENWOOD:      This man should be suspended;he is still in command of I Company.THE PRIME.MINISTER said he ought to be in a positionto say that the Colonel was suspended.- sr-The Conference then adjourned at 11.30 until^ 12.15 in Mr.Bonar Lsw&apos;s Room at the House of Commons. \On re-assembling,  the attached draft of a statementprepared by the Irish Office for the guidance of the primeMinister and Lord Curzon at the Opening of Parliament was circulated and read.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he did not intend to read the draft, but simply to take it as instructions.LORD CURZON concurred,  and said he would follow theline laid down by the Cabinet yesterday, adding the para-graph on page 4 dealing with disciplinary action.SIR HAMAR GREENWOOD stated that only 2.8$ of therateable property of Cork had been burnt.The Conference then proceeded to consider the incident at Mallow,  following upon the shooting and death of Mrs.King, and the shooting and wounding of a number ofRailway servants.THE PRIME MINISTER read a draft of the letter whichthe Chief Secretary proposed to send to Mr.J.H.Thomas,  to
the effect that an Enquiry was proceeding.) THE PRIME MINISTER felt that in view of the debate in the House, such a reply would be utterly inadequate and the Government ought to give their own provisionalaccount of what had taken place.SIR HAMAR GREENWOOD then read two Police reports which had been received, which did not agree.      According toone report, the police had been fired at as they went tothe Station and they fired back in return, that is to say the murderers had fired first and there had been a casualty.According to the other report, .the men who had been woundedhad been arrested and were being marched off, when  the rebels,  thinking they were Police, fired on them and killedthem.The Conference favoured the first report as themore probable.SIR HAMAR GREENWOOD stated that an inquest had beenheld by three Military Officers (in lieu of a Coroner&apos;sInquest), that it had been twice adjourned owing to thedifficulty of obtaining evidence, and in the verdict they found &quot;deceased was murdered by some person unknown&quot;.MR.B0NAR LAW said that this was reported in the&quot;Daily Herald&quot; that day.SIR HAMAR GREENWOOD suggested that the line to betaken was     at the order of procedure in the Martial Lawarea would be followed in this as in similar cases and( 2) that the Railwaymen had given no information to help thepollce.The Chief Secretary then handed a number of papersto the prime Minister which had been prepared to illustrate the improvement in the condition of Ireland in the last six months,  and the Chief Secretary undertook   to obtain further information as to the rate of resignations from theIrish Police Force six months ago -^-%o* the present time.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.15th February, 19 21.
