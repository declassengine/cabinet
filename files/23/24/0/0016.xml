Fisher&apos;cabinet Committee on this subject,with a view to an immediate reportto the Cabinet on this question.Any necessary modifications in theconstitution of the Committee, tomeet recent changes in the Cabinet,were left to the Prime Minister andMr Cha rabe rl a in.
-b^fyr^n the Priire Minister .and the Secretary of State forthe Colonies  (Mr Churchill) at Cairo, on thr subject ofour future pr&amp;ioy in Mesopotamia and Palestine (CP.PapersNo3.  2742,  2743, 2 744,  2 751, 2753 and 2755).So far as general policy is concerned, the essentialMatures of the al oVe telegrams are as followsSubject to satisfactory arrangements in regardto  the Emir Peisal,&apos; and to there being nooffensive action against Mesopotamia by theTurks, the whole of the Imperial and localauthorities who met Mao Churchill at Cairoare agreed.on an immediate reduction by approximately one-third of the troops providedfor Mesopotamia in the Estimates for 19si-22.This reduction will take place as rapidly as shipping  can be accumulated.&quot;lie resultant saving on the Estimates for Pales-tine and Mesopotamia is estimated at  5,500,000.The reduced garrison will be on a 2.3-Battalionsscale.If the country remains  quiet and is not subjected to external disturbance;    if the Arab Governmentproves a success&quot;,    and if satisfactory progress is made with the development of local forces, afurther reduction will be. made In October, to a12-Battal ions scale, with further resultant saving.The principle has been accepted that the ces tof the garrison in Mesopotamia in 1923--24 shallnot exceed an average of  5,000,000 -  6,000,000 -a year, though this.depends on successful poiit-icai administration.^SlJ^yiL-SlSSAL &quot;aIID. ^!3UX.LA11.  -One-of the conditions.... of the above reductions was the installation of the Emir&quot;Peisal as Ruler of Irak.Mr Churchill&apos;s proposal was that the Emir Peisalshould be notified by  Colorol Lawrence that -&quot;in r &quot;p - nco to encuiries from adherents ofthe Fir Poloo-l the British Government havestatbri-hat&apos; they will place no obstacles inthe &quot;way of his candidature as Ruler of Irak,and that If he is  chosen he will have their support.&quot;The Emir Peisal should then proceed to Mecca, and Sir percy cox to Baghdad, where, early in April,  the latter wouldgrant an amnesty on generous lines.    Towards the erf  of Apr!
 the Emir Feisal would telegraph from Mecca to his friends in Mesopotamia, communicating the above notification from His Majesty&apos;s Government and stating that, after discussion with his father and brothers, he had decided to offer his services to Irak. Further, Mr Churchill contemplated an eventual modification of the Mesopotamia Mandate to facilitate Feisal&apos;s position: an appeal by Feisal for support to Naqib and Sayid Talib, as representing the Provisional Government: a definite withdrawal of his candidature by Feisal&apos;s brother Abdulla: after which, if the first effects were satisfactory, Feisal would come to Mesopotamia during Ramazan.

 The main difficulty of this programme was explained in the Prime Minister&apos;s telegram of March 15th, which was drawn up in collaboration with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and proceeded from the hostile attitude of the French Government towards Feisal. We had intimated to the French Foreign Office that if there was a strong demand for Feisal from Mesopotamia and peace could be restored by his establishment as Ruler of Irak, we should not feel justified in opposing his candidature, but unless the initiative came from Mesopotamia it would be difficult to reconcile Mr Churchill&apos;s programme with the attitude we had taken up. In short, the question at issue was as to whether Mr Churchill&apos;s plan did not cast the initiative too definitely upon the British Government.

In a later telegram in regard to Palestine (Paper C.P.-2751) Mr Churchill had amplified his suggestion in regard to the Emir Feisal by a further proposal that the Emir Abdullah, who had originally been an aspirant to become ruler of Irak, should be approached with a view to his becoming a Governor of Trans-Jordania under the High Commissioner of Palestine, and that he should be fortified there by the presence of a British force, which should enable him to restrain the people of that region from making trouble for the French. 
T-:s th&quot; &apos;^&apos;r^ and interest to acquiesce in the double arrangement of Peisal asruler If Mesopotamia and of Abdullah (under the High Commis-eiAner of Palestine) as ruler of Trans-Jordania.In a final .tele;;rcr. (Paper C.P,-S755) Mr Churchillset forth his appreciation of the difficulties of this problem, and ashed for reasonable latitude in dealing with it on the&quot; spot.SOUTHERN KURDISTAM.    As regards Southern Kurdistan, mr churchill&apos;s proposal was not to make any attempt to force under the rule of an Arab Government, the purely Kurdish dis-tricts of Southern Kurdistan; which they would undoubtedlyresist, but to inform them, as well as the Irak Government,that our intention under the Mandate was to maintain theexisting arrangement until such time as a representative body of Kurdish States should opt for inclusion in Irak.REPUCTTCMS OF THE GARRISON OP MESOPOTAMIA.Mr Churchill&apos;s proposals in regard to the steps to be taken for the reduction of the garrison may be summarised asfollows(i)  To continue the reductions already approvedto 33 Battalions, 6 Cavalry Regiments, etc.,for the speeding up of which additionalshipping is required;(ii) On the completion ^f the above,  to make thefollowing further reductions2 British Battalions,.1 British Cavalry Regiment,0 Indian Battalions,3 Indian Cavalry Regiments,2 Companies of Sappers and Miners,5 Field Batteries,4 Pack Batteries.(iii)  In consequence of the new arrangements,only 3 Battalions instead of 14 to besent from India to relieve troops now inM e s o p o t ami a&apos;.(iv) The War Iffiee to arrange at once with Indiato get rid o^ the whole or the greater partof a charge of  2,500,000 in 1921-22 for indian units maintained in India to providerelie fs:(v)  Consequential reduction of 25,000 surplushorses and mules.,  to be sold locally orotherwise di ? posed of.
PALESTINE AND TRANS-JoRDANTA,    Mr--Churchill was unable to recommend a reduction of the garrison ef PaJ^esivina^which in the last six months has been reduced from 25,000 to7,000.The proposed occupation of Trans-Jordania, to whichallusion has already been made, wAuld require one Battalion,two  Squadrons, and two guns, involving an increase of oneIndian Battalion and one Cavalry Regiment for the next sixmgnfhs,  after which local forces would be sufficiently traln-ed to relieve trr.eps in Northern Palestine to the extent ofthis increase.    Thus, the additional charge involved isestimated at only  153,000.BIN SATED.   Mr Churchill farther proposed (Paper CP.-2755)  to incfease Bin Sard&apos;a subsidy to  100,000 a year,paid monthly in arrears,  conditional on his maintaining peacewith Mesopotamia, Koweit and Hejaz.    Sir Percy Cox had advised that this sum would suffice to ensure his good will over thecoming difficult period, after which it might be possible tore due e It.KINO .EUS3BIN,    A similar sum would ba paid to king hussein,  conditional on improved arrangements for the pilgrim-age, recognition of the Peace Treaties, and exercise of his influence in bringing about peace in the Arab countries.YEMEN. With a view to a withdrawal of the outlyingdetachments of the Aden garrison, Mr Churchill proposed an offer to Imam, of a subsidy of  2,000 a&apos; month. In order toenable us to control the Idrioi pressure of Imam&apos;s west&apos;-rnfrontier, and so to influence the latter, he proposed a subsidy of  1,000 a month to Idrissi on the condition thathe excludes&apos; foreign-&apos; re from his area.
PALESTINE AND TRANS-JORDANIA

Mr Churchill was unable to recommend a reduction of the garrison of Palestine, which in the last six months has bean reduced from 25,000 to 7,000.

 The proposed occupation of Trans-Jordania, to which allusion has  already been made, would require one Battalion, two Squadrons, and two guns, involving an increase of one Indian Battalion and one Cavalry Regiment for the next six months, after which local forces would be sufficiently trained to relieve troops in Northern Palestine to the extent of this increase. Thus, the additional charge involved is estimated at only  £153,000.

BIN SAUD. Mr Churchill further proposed (Paper C.P.275S) to increase Bin Saud&apos;s subsidy to  £100,000 a year, paid monthly in arrears conditional on his maintaining peace with Mesopotamia, Koweit and Hajaz. Sir Percy Cox had advised that this sum would suffice to ensure his good will over the coming difficult period, after which it might be possible to reduce it.

KING-HUSSE1N. A similar sum would be paid to King Hussein, conditional on improved arrangements for the pilgrimage, recognition of the Peace Treaties, and exercise of his influence in bringing about peace in the Arab countries.

 YEMEN. With a view to a withdrawal of the outlying detachments of the Aden garrison, Mr Churchill proposed an offer to Imam of a subsidy of  £2,000 a month. In order to enable us to control the Idrisi pressure of Iman&apos;s western frontier, and so to influence the latter, he proposed a subsidy of  £1,000 a months to Idrissi on the condition that he excluded foreign from his area.
In regard to the above comprehensive proposals the Cabinet agreed -

a) THE EMIR FEISAL. That, in order to facilitate our arrangements with the French Government, the procedure in regard to the Emir Feisal should be based on the lines of the last part of Mr Churchill&apos;s telegram of  March 21st (Paper C.P.-2755), and should be as follows:-

Sir Percy Cox should return at once to Baghdad, and should set going the machinery which might result in an acceptance of Feisal&apos;s candidature and in an invitation to him to accept the position of ruler of Iraq. No formal communication should be made to the French at this moment, but the Foreign Office should give Feisal a hint that he should now return to Mecca.  In doing so they should intimate to him informally that the post of ruler over Iraq is vacant, and that if he was offered the position by the people of Mesopotamia, and his father and brothers were agreeable to the suggestion, we should welcome their choice, subject to the double condition that he is prepared to accept, the terms of the mandate as laid before the League of Nations and that he will not use his position to attack or intrigue with the French. Mr Churchill&apos;s suggestion that the acceptance of a mandate by Feisal did not preclude a subsequent re-adjustment of the relations between the mandatory and the Mesopotamian Government was concurred in, though it did not appear necessary at this stage to speak of a Treaty. If the above conditions are fulfilled, Feisal should, at the right moment. ?ake known from Mecca his candidature and issue his appeal to the Mesopotamian people. This would be the stage for a communication to the French.

(b) THE EMIR ABDULLAH AND TRANS-JORDANIA.

That no immediate decision could be taken in regard to the proposal for appointing the Fmir Abdullah as Governor of Trans-Jordania under the High Commissioner of Palestine, nor in regard to the other proposals for occupying Trans-Jordania, in regard to both of which the Cabinet felt considerable misgivings. On political grounds they were informed that the installation of Abdullah to Trans-Jordania, combined with that of Feisal in Mesopotamia, would be regarded by the French as a menace. On military grounds they were reminded by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff that the occupation of Trans-Jordania would involve a new commitment, the extension and duration of which it was impossible to forecast. The Cabinet, recognised that, in the event of an attack on the French in Syria from Trans-Jordania, we should not be entirely free from responsibility, since Trans-Jordania, though not forming part of the mandated territory, is included in th eBritish zone of influence under the Sykes-Picot Agreement. In view of the proximity that of Trans-Jordania, however, they felt that the possibility should not be excluded of exercising such control as was necessary.
by action from Palestine itself. In these circumstances they felt that the right course would be to communicate their misgivings to Mr Churchill before his interview with, the Emir Abdullah at Jerusalem on Easter Monday.

(c)KURDISTAN. To take note of and approve Mr Churchill&apos; s proposals in regard to Kurdistan.

(d) MILITARY REDUCTIONS AND SHIPPING. To agree to the proposals in Part V of Mr Churchill&apos;s telegram of March 16 (Paper C.P.-2743) in regard to military reductions and shipping, and to authorise the Secretary of State for War to arrange all details with Mr Churchill.

(e) To reserve the question of the proposed sub-subsidies to the various Arab authorities for discussion with Mr Churchill. Although these were generally regarded as excessive, no immediate decision appeared to be required.

(f) That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should draw up a comprehensive explanatory telegram, on the above lines, for the Prime Minister to send to Mr Churchill.



TURKEY.

The French Withdrawal from Cilicia.

(6) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed the Cabinet, that he had received information to the effect that the arrangements between the French Government and the Angora Delegation went far beyond a mere negotiation for the mutual withdrawal of their forces from Cilicia. They involved an extension of the French sphere in Turkey, and were at variance with the Tripartite Agreement. This might prove useful as a ? for inducing the French Government to be reasonable in regard to our arrangements for the mandated territories.

LEAKAGE OF INFORMATION.

(7) With reference to Paner C.P.-2756, the attention of the Cabinet was drawn to a paragraph which had appeared in that day&apos;s "Daily Express" in which an account was given of what had taken place at a meeting of the Government of Ireland Act Drafting Committee, held at the House of Commons on the previous day.      
IRELAND

? - Table for the Government of Ireland Act.

(8) With reference to Cabinet 10 (21), Conclusion 1, and Home Affairs Committee 83, Conclusions 3 &amp; 4, the Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Chief Secretary for Ireland (Paper C.P.-2723) dealing with the time-table of proceedings for the first elections and first meetings of the Parliaments of Southern and Northern Ireland, together with the Report of the Drafting Committee on the Government of Ireland Act, 1980, which had considered the Orders in Council necessary for putting the Government of Ireland Act into operation (Paper C.P.-2756). The Drafting Committee had agreed that the 19th April next should be fixed as the Appointed Day for the provisions of the Act relative to the making of Orders in Council. This date had already been approved by the Home Affairs Committee at their meeting on March 17th, subject to the Prime Minister&apos;s consent.

The Cabinet were reminded of the views which had been expressed by Lord Midleton, but were informed that the Home Affairs Committee were nevertheless of opinion that an opportunity ought to be given to the South of Ireland to proceed with the election of a Parliament. It was pointed out that if it were found undesirable or impossible to utilise the services of public men in the South of Ireland, a Council consisting of nominated soldiers or Civil Servants could be set up.

Inasmuch as General Macready, Sir John Anderson and General Tudor were due to be in London on the following the day, the Cabinet agreed --

To refer the time-table for further consideration by the Home Affairs Committee, together, with the Chief Secretary for Ireland and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty, at a meeting to be held on Wednesday, March 23rd, at 10-30 a.m. with General Macready, General Tudor and Sir John Anderson in attendance.


(-9 )    rrrhf,. Chief:-Secretary-?Trb.-land. mlnformed theR( o-rt of the &apos;Mallow Enquiry..

This Enquiry had been held in public and hadbeen attended by Counsel,- and- in. these- respects ,was of adifferent character from that-held into the Cork burnings.In the Cork -Case there had been&apos;n? deaths,  the Enquiry wasprivate, and the Report was one made to^superior militaryauthorit7.On these grounds the Cabinet agreed- -- 70 &quot;authorise the Chief Secretary to publish the&apos;, Mallow Report.IRELANJ(1C) The Cabinet had before-them a Memorandum by the-Bompensation   Chief Secretary for -Ireland, dealing with the question offor Maliciousjln-j^-iTies. Exchequer assistance towards payment of compensation formalicious damage in Ireland (Paper C.F.-3637).The Cabinet were generally agreed that if a beginnia.were&apos; made to give compensation at the present time on theground of destruction of property attributed to the actisnof members of the Grown Forces, all damage tc propertythroughout Ireland-during the recent disturbances would, belaid at the doors of- the Government.Tir Cabinet agreed-&apos;--&apos;&apos;To postpone the subject for further&apos;consideration.
FlTlMGKFTC&quot; Wlth reference t0 Cabinet 17 (20), Conclusion 3,the Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Postmaster-General recommending certain changes in Post Office. Servicesand charges, in order to meet the prospective deficits inthe revenue cf the root Office (Paper CP,-3704).General agreement was expressed with the suggestion made by the Postmaster-General iri his Memorandum, thatSunday collections and deliveries should be abolished.The Cabinet agreed -To refer the proposals of the Postmaster-General to the following. Committee,  forconsideration and report:-The Minister of Transport (in the Chair),.The Postmaster-General, or his representative,The Financial Secretary to the Treasury,The Under-Seoretary of State for the Colonies.-Mr T. St. Q, Hill (Secretary).RUSSIAN TRADE       (12) With reference to Cabinet 13 (21), Conclusion 1, theAGREEMENT.attention of the Cabinet was called to Questions which were,   being put in the house of Commons to the President of the Boardof Trade, on the legal and-ether effects of the Russian trade agreement.    The answers given to such questions would be of very great importance because of their influence on the courts in the event of any legal proceedings that might be taken to attach the property of the Soviet Government.The Cabinet, agreed - That the President of the &quot;card of Trade should consult the Lord Chancellor and the Law Officersof the  Crown in the preparation of any answers to be given, and. that such answers should be seen by the&quot;Prime Minister before they were given inthe house,   e        ... ,    &apos;. ; 1BCRBT S,TRY 10.&quot;,      (13) The Cabinet approved the appointment of the following committee  &quot;&apos;ss&quot;r &quot;&quot;&quot;arren Fisher (Chairman),Sir Eyre Crowe,S1 r Mauri c s- Hankey,to examine the expenditure on Secret service by the several.Departments, and,  after hear-in c; all the necessary evidence, to report their r-v commendations to the Cabinet for rs-ducing expenditure and avoiding overlapping.-0 1 -
GREECE.- (-14) -The Secretary of State for War informM:-t^--XJaiiin0t,Withdrawal       that .the Greek-HS-ov^ 11th Greekof the Divi-aionfroir, the divisions&amp;h (at present holding the Ism-id Peninsula and underIsinid I^eninsula. - . ,General Harington&apos;s command) to tike part in offensive operations about to commence against Mustapha Xemal&apos; s forces.The Division in question was at present supplied from thesarne base as the/British forces in the Constantinople area.The Cabinet were generally agreed, that, while we couldnot prevent the- Greeks from withdrawing their forces, itmust, be rttRde&quot; perfectly clear to them that if they were taking part in offensive-operations against the Turksthey could not be fed from the British base, and that our responsibility for them wevuld cease from the moment thatthey ceased to be under our command.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff warned the&apos; Cabinet that if the .,Greek Division was withdrawn and the.Greek forces were beaten by the Turks, the Allied position:at Ismid and in the Constantinople area could not be held with the -firces at present available,;It was suggested that in such an eventuality theBritish forces should be withdrawn in accordance with thegeneral policy of withdrawal from the Constantinople area.The Italian Government had failed to take its proper share in the occupation of the Constantinople area, and the onlytroops available had been the 11th Greek Division.    If thiswas withdrawn it might be necessary to expedite the retire-ment from Constantinople.Thp Cabinet&quot; agreed  -That the War Office should inform theMilitary&apos; Adviser of the Greek Delegationthat the British Government could not. Ofcourse, restrain the 11th Greek Division--from leaving the British Command., but,as ive could&apos; not be concerned in any opera-tions they might undertake,, the-Greek Gov-ernment must make their own arrangements as regards supplies for the 11th division from the moment when it leaves the BrivishCommand.
to the ,0abinet,  covering a Report of the Jrrbex-AJJLied    &apos;Rhine land High Commission regarding the present and pro-posed Customs organisation&apos;in the occupied territories(paper cp.-2741) i    This  Report had been submitted in accordancewith a decision of the recent Conference in London as a preliminary ot^p towards the establishment of a Customsservice as bne o f the penalties to be applied in conse-quence ofGermany&apos;s refusal to execute the Treaty of Ver-sailles.The Cabinet were informed that the&apos;establishment ofthis service in the British area of occupation would involvethe provision of some &apos;8C Custom House officials and ofadditional troops.    The latter .could not be provided until after the return of the Battalion?sent to Upper Silesia inconnection with the plebiscite there, unless fresh Battalionwere sent from home.   The.alternative was for French Customsofficers and French troops to enter the British area.Some doubt was &apos;express&apos;sbed as to the necessity for sending troops to protect the Customs officers, as therewere no signs of any local outbreak.General.agreement was expressed with the view thatthe initial tariff which&apos; it is proposed, to levy betweenthe occupied end unoccupied portions of Germany shouldbe a moderate one and that it should not be raised fromthe initial level without &quot;further instructions from HisMajesty&apos;s Government.    A high Duty would damage the Rhine-land severely, and&apos; ould give an impetus to French tradewith the rhineland and  the occupied parts of Germany,  atthe&apos;&quot;expense of our own trade-.--It-was ^other suggested that the whole of theCustoos arrangements &apos; should, be reviewed within a short period of from three to six months.The Cabinet agreed &apos;-- ee
(a).. That the President of the Board of trade should summon a Conference of Expertsrepresenting  The Board o f &apos;Trade,The Foreign Office,The Board,of Customs and Excise --to consider without delay the details of customs organisation: &apos;(b) That a;;&apos;Principal&apos; Officer of Customs shouldbe sent outyfco advise I r Arnold Robertson,the British Rhine land .. Cvnua^sexoner j in thelight Of the conclusions reached by the.foro.gb.ing Ccpferencet(c) -That the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should communicate with the Allied governments with a view to arranging that the Report ofthe Rhineland Commission in regard to the pro-, posed new Customs frontier should be consid-ered by the Conference of Ambassadors at Paris,,&apos;,. with fhom should be associated the necessarytechnical experts * Lord Hardinge should beinformed that, immediately on the conclusionof the Board of Trade Ennuiry, the necessaryexperts-would be placed at his disposal.(16) The Cabinet had a short discussion as to whetherofficial, entertainment should be offered by the BritishGovernment to M0 Poincare&apos;, the ex-President of the french republic, on his forthcoming visit to London as Chairman ofa Committee concerned in the arrangement whereby the City ofLondon interests itself in the restoration of Verdun.After an examination of various precedents and a consideration of the precedent which would be set for thefuture, the Cabinet agreed -*&quot;hat, the Secretary of State for-Foreign affairs should ask the British Ambassador in Paris to sound the French Government on the subjects
SILESIA,(17) The Cabinoimw ore&quot;&apos;reminded that the result of the he Result of Plebiscite In Upper Silesiahe Plebiscite.tion of the British, attitude at the Peace&quot;&apos;Conference.    Aftex^the - German remarks had been received on the Treaty of Ver-sallies,  as many members of the British Cabinet as Gould be spared had,come to Pains, and in conference with represents-tives of the Dosiiniona had conferred on the modifications tobe made in the Treaty,,    One of their recommendations had beenin favour of the plebiscite in Upper Silesia, and with their support the British &quot;Delegation had, with some difficulty,succeeded in getting it accepted by the Peace Conference(British Empire Delegation Minutes 32 to 35).After a short further discussion, the Cabinet agreed -That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should notify to the EritiehRepresentative on the.Plebiscite Commis-sion,as well as to the British Represenb-ative&quot; on the Ambassadors&apos; Conference inParis, the general view of the Cabinet,,namely, that the existence in isolatedareas of a Polish or a German majoritydid not justify breaking up the unity ofUpper Silesia, and attempts to do so shouldbe resisted.

J^KWm. Secret^ of State for Foreign Affair, stated.1st Dele-that the Italian Ambassador,  Signor de Martino, had seen him...tig^ during the morning and had informed him that Count Sforzawas arriving on Sunday,  and that the Ken-allst delegation from Angora was at present in Rome,    Count Sforza would liketo have an invitation from the British Government which hecould communicate to the Keroalists, and oo be able to inform them that this invitation had been obtained by his personalintervention.    The Ambassador ashed that we might send someinvitation to this effect.   He (Lord Curzon) had pointedout that an invitation had already been sent to the Kernel is tsvia Constantinople, and that the deputation&apos;had been ap-pointed and had already started.    To this invitation theFrench and Italians had assented.    To issue a fresh in.Vi.ta-tion would place the Turkish Government in a very difficult position.    He was inclined to agree with Count Sforza thatthere is a close understanding between Constantinople and the kemalists, and suggested sending a telegram to Count Sforzathrough the Italian Ambassador,  saying that there is no need to send an invitation, since the delegation had already started.The Secretary of State for India said Ire consideredthe situation satisfactory if tho Delegation came;    but, onthe other hand,  the Delegation might not actually come.    Ifthe relegation did not come,  the reason for the Conferencedisappeared, which would mean that there could be no peace in the Tast.    It would be preferable if the Kemaliat and constantinople Delegations came together, but if they wouldnot do this they should be allowed to come separately,rather than that either should be absent.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that thecause of peace ought not to be jeopardised on a point ofetiquette-    He had no ob lection to the Italians bringing the Angora Delegates.    This Delegation were the people whorepresented the eld  Turkish Government.    At present theBritish policy appeared to he one of /taking inroads on the
Turkish. Pocoeesibns, and aggressions on the whole Islamic&apos;!:&apos; ogrement *    Before Peace with Turkey had he en signed he had wished to attack the Turks in every possible way, but now he desired to listen te - what their Delegates had to say..If,, when they arrived,, it was found that they - claimed iwpos-sible things,  then he was quite ready for any countermeasures.Afteif som&apos;e further discussion, the Conference agreedThat  the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should send  the  following telegram to Count Sforsa,.. through the Italian Aribas-sadcr:-&quot;Invitation to Angora Delegation hasalready been given, and they are well ontheir way...  His JfejestyAs Government agreewith Count Sforza in thinking that it isimpossible to extend a wore formal invita-tion at this dote..&quot;(2) The Conference agreed  . That there should be a meeting of repre-sentatives of the Allied Powers at 10,Downing Street,  on Monday, February 21,1921,  at 11-30 a.m, ,. to arrange the pro-cedure to be followed during the Confer-enoe with the representatives of greece and Torkey.(?) The Price Minister invited the Secretary cf State forForeign Affairs to review the main questions likely to ariseduring the Conference.The Secretory of State for Foreign Affairs stated thatat the Paris Conference it had. been recognised that not onlyhad the Treaty of Sevres rot been ratified, but that certain points of i t had already fallen into desuetude by the passageof events,., and in other respects was- open to revision.He was of opinion, and. he believed the French were inclined to agree,, that the Treaty of Sevres should not be sacrificed...for this would reopen the whole question of the Middle %st,Mandates for Mesopotamia, Syria and Palestine, the Bulgarianquestion, Thrace, and the Straits..   It appear- d to himadvisable to proceed on the basis of the Sevres Treaty,but -to be willing to modify certain -features of it.
An understanding should first of all be come to on those parts of the Sevres Treaty which should remain unchanged,and he suggested that alterations should net be allowed inrespect of the following:-.(i) Constantinople:    i.e.,that the Sultan shouldhave his Government and Capital there:(di) The Straits: i.e..,that the Straits should bein the hands of an&apos;International Commission,safeguarding the passage frw.m the Mediter-ranean to the Black Sea:(iii) The Turkish Empire in Europe: i.e., the clauses dealing with Thrace and the de-militarised zone.The Kemal1sts would undoubtedly ask for (iii) to be revised and advance demands for Adrianople, Chatalja and othercities to be returned to the Turks,.   He considered thatthese should be resisted, for the fallowing reasons:-   Ifthe frontier were re-adjusted to. the Enos-Media line,  terri-tory would be handed over to Turkey in which the population is more Greek than Turk, and in Northern Thrace Greece wouldbe unable to maintain herself.    Bulgaria would enter thefield- and want compensation, and the Turk would be brought back in command of both banks of the Straits and the Sea of marmora.    Proceeding, lord Curzon stated that other points which he considered should not be touched were:-(iv) Clacses relating to Mesopotamia, palestine and Syria:,(v) Glances relating to the Heiaz:(vi) Clauses relating to our status in Cyprus,Egypt, eta:(vii) Clauses relating to Italian status in the Aegean, Libya, etc:(viii) Clauses relating to the status of Prancein Morocco, Tunis,etc.There remained,  however, some other points of the treaty which he considered were open to discussion and might be revised.   He considered these points to be:-(ix) Kurdistan;(x) Armenia:(xi) Smyrna,
tlici-a. .(xii) He-did not propose todouch Cillcia,. because that was a Frenchquestion.    France had proposed to occupy it, hut now sheproposes to evacuate it owing to the expense and difficulty&quot;holding it.The Secretary of Stats for the Colonies enquiredabout the Italian area.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs repliedthat this was not mentioned in the Treaty.    This was dealt-with in the Tripartite Agreement,  and the Tripartite Agree-ment was not in the Treaty, although the Italians wished itto he.urdistan.   (xiii)       As regards Kurdistan, we had originally contemplated the Kurds being autonomous under some sort of British super-vision; but now, owing to our present position in Mesopotamia,this would be most difficult to arrange.    If an agreement could be core to with the Kerralists it might be possible toarrange for some sort of autonomous State of Kurdistan underTurki sh snpervi si on.enia. (xiv) We recognised Armenia by the Treaty to be an Independ-ent State, with a Capital at Erivan.    The boundaries of thisIndependent State were not settled, and had been referred to president Wilson.    President wilson had proposed to includelarge portions of Turkish territory, including Trebizond,in the State of Armenia, but that was now quite impossible,owing to the course of events.    The Turks and the Bolshevikshad descended on to the borders of Annrehia &apos; simultaneously.First, the ^urks, with the cognizance of the Bolsheviks, hadcore and taken Ears&apos; and other places in that neighbourhood,and then the Bolsheviks, seeing that the Turks were alreadyappropriating the country,  started to act for themselves;they commenced by flooding the country with Bolshevistpropaganda, followed up by Soviet emissaries, until eyentu-ally a Soviet Government had been formed at Erivan.    Moan-while, the anti-Bolsheviks of Armenia were organising aresistance.    He thought that with the help of the Kemalists
I - 182we might be able to get a definite boundary agreed upon between Armenia and Turkey, but we could not arrange aG -boundary between Armenia and the Bolsheviks;    that theymust settle amongst themselves.    In this way the Arri-.eni.anQmight secure an autonomous existence.    In the event of Ciliciabeing handed back to the Turks it might be advisable for usto try and arrange for the Armenian residents there tomigrate and join the Armenians in Armenia Proper,lyrna. (xv) Next, as to Smyrna, by the Treaty of Sevres a nominalsuzerainty of the Turks had to be maintained there,  but otherwise the administration was to be Greek in every respect. The local Parliament, after five years, was to havethe opportunity of incorporating the country as. part of greece if it wo desired.    Lord Gurson was convinced that whatever the Kemalists might say about Adrianople, theywould take a very firm line on the question of Smyrna.    Theposition was that the Greeks were a majority of the populatiiaand they also had military forces there;    and as long as theycontinued the Veniselisf policy they would be very loath towithdraw.    Our attitude would largely depend on whether theConference encouraged the Greeks to carry on hostilities in Asia Minor.    It was essential to make some satisfactory arrangement about Smyrna,    Greece would have to be givensomething solid, and the Turks would have to be propitieted.Inasmuch as the whole history of rnurkey showed a slippingaway to other nations of the outlying provinces, he thought the safest method would be to act on the analogy of one ofthe provinces which had become- detached from the turkish empire.    He considered that the example of Eastern Roumelia,as  created by the Treaty of Berlin in 1878, was possibly thebest precedent.    Most people probably,realised that Smyrnawould eventually slip away ^rom Turkey in exactly the same way as Roumelia, but what was required was an interim arrangement to meet the present situation.    The constitutionof Eastern Roumelia right be adapted to the proposed
arrangements for Smyrna.    He would suggest^ (a) That Turkish suzerainty should be recognisedover Smyrna&apos;:(b) rlbat a Christian Governor should bs appointedby the Powers for five years, who might be either a Greek or of other nationality;    pos-sihly at first it would be better  for him notto be a Greek:(o) That the military defences of the area shouldhe organised by means of&apos; a Gendarmerie ar-ranged by the Powers:(d) That an Administration dealing with Customs,Law Courts, etc.,  should be devised.    Underthe &quot;&quot;treaty of Sevres the w hole of this Adrain-isfration was to bs handed over to the Greeks&apos;:(e) That a Provisional Assembly should be appointed.He would not go into any further details, but he was quitssure that during the first few days of the Conference claims and counter-claims of all sorts would he put forward by thevarious parties at the Conference, and when they had all ex-exhausted there elves in their demands he was of opinion that we might come forward with something on the above lines, whichmight prove acceptable.In reply to a question, Lord Cur sr. on stated that,underthe arrangement which he had outlined, Greece world have allthat  she had won in Europe, and would exercise the dominationin Smyrna to which h&quot;-r trade and hrr population entitled her.Lord Curtaon wert on to say that he would suggest that thedistrict should be called &quot;The Smyrna Province&quot;, as th&amp;fewould, humour the Turks, who translated &quot;Province&quot; by&quot;Vilayet&quot;.Tripartite (xvi) Other points of importance were:-Aj?reernent.(i) The maintenance of the bargain by which theItalians would have to hand back the Islands(with the exception of Rhodes)  to Greece:(ii) The observance of the Tripartite agreement was a matter to which Italy attached greatimportance, as she hoped to obtain therebya considerable amount of mineral and other advantages,Military&apos;   (xvii) As regards the military provisions of the Treaty, heProvi gi one . hi ,   ! ^ - ,had at first understood that the war Office were disturbed at the prospect of keeping troops in tho- demilitarised area,
I but be-now-understood that they did not wish to make any(J changes in the military provisions, though they held strongviews on the political clauses.*talja.....(xvi.il) In reply to a question why the substitution of theI Bnos-Media line for Ghatalja damaged British interests, Lord-*urzon stated that British interests were not directly affeot-ed except through the fact that this would mean that therewould be no chance of a real peace.    The Greeks would haveto be turned out, and th   Bulgarians would immediately come in.The Secretary of State for India ashed whether It wasadvisable for the Government definitely to decide beforehandwhat they would alter in the Treaty of Sevres and what theywould not;    would it not be better to wait and see thevarious claims put forward by the Delegations at the Confer-ence, and then decide what course of action to adopt?serbai jan. (xix) The Prime Minister was inclined to agree.    Ee went onto say that he was of opinion&apos;that Mustapha Kernel was reallylooking towards the East rather than to the West.    He thoughtthat Mustapha kemal was basing his strength in Azerbaijanand would like to know if he could be encouraged in that direction.    Azerbaijan could not possibly remain independent,and would have to be either Turkish or Bolshevist.Lord Curzon, continuing, said that it must be remember-ed that a large portion of the population of Azerbaijan wasTurkish and Mohammedan, and their presence would create lessharm to us than that of the Bolsheviks.    Then also there wasorgia.(xx)     the existence of Georgia, which State the Government had onlythe other day recognised de jure.  a edurse to which he himself had been opposed.    The existence of eGeorgia was one of themain difficulties in the problem of the Caucasus.    He didnot say this because he felt any animosity against theGeorgians:    on the contrary, one must admire the way Inwhich they had resisted the blandishments of the Soviet Goy--ernment.    It was, however,  of the utmost importance to preventthe -Turks  from getting back to Batum.
The Secretary of State for the Colonies said he would&quot;be pre pare&amp; to hand Azerbaijan to the Turks *The- Secretary of State for India suggested that theForeign Office should consider two points:-(a) Whether a Constitution, on lines somewhat similar to that of Roumelia, could not beapplied to Thrace:.RA3S (xxi) . (b) Whether it would not assist in a settlementof the Near. -Eastern question to invite theArabs to be represented at the Conference inthe following weeks the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs hoped thatthe occasion of the forthcoming Conference would be used tobring aibout an agreement between the French and the Arabs ?but he doubted if the best way to do this was by the latter being invited to take part in the general negotiations. Theyhad no locus stand! in the matter, King Hussein having do- -clined to sign the Treaty of Sevres,     He thought the beat waywas for the British representatives at the Conference to dealdirect with M, Berihelot.A suggestion was mo.de that, as we might be prepared tomake Concessions to the French regarding Mustapha Kerns. 1, theFrench, as a quid pro quo, should make concessions which, would facilitate agreement with the Arabs at Baghdad and Damascusand in Transjordania.The Secretary of State for India said that he feltcertain that either the Angora or the Constantinople Turks would raise the question of the guardian ship of the holy places, and if King Hussein was confronted with the poss-ibllity of his&quot; subsidy being cut off he would be more inclined to come to some arrangement with the Sultan on this question.The Secretary of State for the Colonies expressedregret at the suggestion that we should cast aside the Arabconception of - guarding the Holy Places, and pointed out that whilst there was much to be said in favour of Mustapha Kemalkeeping the Turkish flag flying in places in which he was interested, yet he had little to do with the tombs of MeccaIand Modiha *(3)
The Secretary of State for Kndia explained that he did not mean to suggest that the Turk should ever go hack to. Arabiaonly that some arrangement might be come to by whichhis - spiritual authority eyer, the Holy Places was maintained.The Lord President of the Council said he had not beenin a position to follow closely the financial and military considerations of this question, but in his opinion they hadpsvrvorted the policy-- of the Allies in. regard to Turkey.Putting aside^ however, this aspect of the question, hethought the position a deplorable one.    Of ,all the nations who entered the War,&apos; the Bulgarians and the Turks had the worst record9  and Turkey, which.owed its continued existenceto Prance and England, had behaved in an abominable manner and caused untold misfortunes,,    He considered that the turks had proved themselves quite hopeless-,    They had had mereopportunities and had shown themselves more incompetent than any race in the world.    Whilst the Arabs had contributed theiiquota to the intellectual attainments of the world, and had produced the Mohammedan religion, the Turks could make nosuch claim.;    nor had they shown any administrative ability.There was plenty of evidence to show that the Turk was notcapable of ruling.    He had no great opinion.of the BorderStates who had cast off the Turkish yoke, but it was signi-significant that once they were freed from the blighting influence of the Turks they had become increasingly civilised.-Mr Balfour,  continuing, said that if - there had been no warand the evolution of the Middle East had continued, there- was much to be said for the. Foreign,.Secretary53 proposals regard-ing Smyrna;    but in present circumstances he thought thearrangement worse than that set out in the Treaty of Sevres.It was bound to offend the Greeks4. and,after all, they wereour Allies during the. War,  - When M., . Venizelos- was recentlyin England he (Mr Balfour) had asked him about the.- defensivepowers of Smyrna, and If. Venizelos had said that Smyrna could hold its own and that Mustapha Kerna1 as a fighting force had
been greatly exaggerated.    M. Ve-rkLselos had asserted thatSrnyrria-vcrlnirnteere would be prepared to defend the Smyrnadistrict.    It had been stated that unless peace was made withMus-faphc Kemal there would be ro peace in the East.    If thispeace was arranged, Kemal would say that he was the onlyperson who had been able to stand  against the Great Powers,and it would add immensely to bis prestige.    He (Mr Balfour)did not believe that the policy suggested would bring peace,and he viewed the revision of the Treaty with the utmostreluctance.    He would strive to confine the Turks withinstrictly Turkish limits.    Our Allies who wished the Treatyrevised were hoping for some selfish advantage thereby.Doubt was expressed as to whether Greece would be ableto bear the financial burdens involved in meeting a potentialKemalist threat that might continue for an indefinite period.The Prime Minister reminded the Conference of theundertaking given by M. Veniaelos&apos; at Lyrapne, that he could,if given permission by the&apos;Allies, inflict a defeat onMustapha Kemal within a fortnight;    and he had carried out his promise within ten days..    Why should it be assumed thatthe Greeks could not defend Smyrna., and that FJustapha Kemal,with no support at all.,   could keep an army in being indefi-nitely?    Smyrna was a rich port ana could, he was informed,raise a numerous body of volunteers.    It was stated thatMustapha Kemal was being financed by the Bolsheviks, but he doubted this, and in any case they did not possess unlimitedresources.    lie did not. think the British Delegates should go into this Conference with the feeling that Mustapha Kemal wssa force before which we must bow down.    To surrender toMustapha Kcrral would not bring peace, but fresh trouble inthe East.The Secretary of State for India asked if sufficientconsideration had boon given to Mustapha Ksmal, not as amilitary danger but as a figure representing all those
interests who were united-against the Treaty of Sevres?fat^vexiGfi^Xo &apos; th&amp; remarks r&amp;gar&amp;ihg the Turkish - proper-tiohcf the population rf -certain.places, he weuldlikc it tobe recorded that he did not accept the figures which were basedon Greek returns.     Further, he would like to add that he attached more importance te the future of Adrlandpie than to Smyrna.The Secretary cf State for the -Colonies regretted the turn the discussion had taken.     We could either-make peacewith the Turks or we could -fight the Turks,      He could-only bringhimself to support Lord Curzon&apos;s policy with difficulty; but he did not believe that any solution of the problem would be found on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister or. Mrs Balfou:rethe result of which would be indefinite disorder over all the regions under review,      If the outcome of the- forthcoming conference were a continuance of the present state of degeneration and theabsence of an effective peace with the Turks:, his task of pacifyingthe Middle East would bo rendered ImpossibleHe could onlyregard such a proposal with dismaynThe Secretary of State for India stated that he had accepted the Treaty of Sevres, but he was bound to press for itsrevision, because it was demonstrable that it had not broughtpeace, and because he was being constantly appealed.to by thesehe represented,  to press for a revision.,      He agreed withMr. Churchill.The Prime Minister stated  that they were all agreed thatthe main object to work for was a permanent peace,, but ho oeujd&apos;not accept the sharp alternatives, put by Mr. Churchill,  of surrender or war as the only possible alternativesc(4)      The Conference had a brief discussion on the questionof&quot;the Anglo-Japanese Alliance in relation to the Dominions -2;, Whitehall Gardens    S.W1.,February 18th,  ISSL

Ministry ofShipping and ministry ofMunitionsCessation Bill.1. WITH reference to Cabinet 12 (21), Conclusion 3, and cabinet 67 (20), Conclusion 1, the Committee had under con-sideration the draft of a Bill providing for the transfer to otherDepartments of the powers and property of the Ministry of munitions and the Ministry of Shipping upon their being wound up before the close of the financial year.Mr. Barnes, on behalf of the Shipping Controller, stated that itwas desired to include the Ministry of Shipping in the Bill.The Committee agreed-To approve the Bill and to authorise the Treasury to arrangefor its introduction in the House of Lords, subject to thefollowing amendments : (i.) The addition of the words &quot;or duties&quot; after theword &quot;powers&quot; on page 2, lines 3, 5, 12 and 15.(ii.) The correction of a misprint in the short title of theBill, which should read &quot; Ministries of munitions and Shipping Cessation Act.&quot;Tuberculosis Bill. 2. With reference to H.A.C.-81, Minute 2, the Committee had under consideration a memorandum by the Minister of Health,CP.-2672, covering the draft of a Bill to transfer to County and county Borough Councils the duty continuing provision for the institutional treatment of tuberculosis, which was taken fromInsurance Committees by the Act of 1920, abolishing sanitoriumbenefit for insured persons. 119 County and County borough councils have already made adequate provision in agreement withthe Ministry of Health, and these Councils are expressed in the bill as having discharged their obligation. Of the remaining 26 Councilsall but one have made some provision,but in some cases it is inadequate.Clause 1 (2) of the Bill provides that if any Council fail to make adequate arrangements, the Minister of Health may make such provisions as he thinks necessary, and recover the expense from theCouncil.The remainder of the Bill is consequential on this, with theexception of Clause 5, which enables County and County borough councils to exercise their powers through a Committee and toappoint on the Committee persons who are specially qualified bytraining or experience.It was explained to the Committee that unless this Bill were introduced j^persons receiving Sanatorium Benefit would automaticallycease to be provided for on the 30th April. The Bill had been cutdown to the smallest possible limits, and would be favourablyreceived by the Approved Societies and Insurance Committees.The Committee agreed To approve the introduction of the Bill in the House of commons by the Minister of Health, subject to the insertion of a scottish Clause, should that be required by the Secretaryfor Scotland.Housing Subsidy. 3. With reference to H.A.C.-81, Minute 2, the Committee had under consideration a Memorandum by the Minister of Health,C.P.-2673, covering the draft of a Bill extending the period of theHousing Subsidy to private builders, and certain other provisionsconnected with housing.It was pointed out that the Bill contained not merely provisions to extend the period for the&apos; Housing Subsidy, but also referred toother matters of a somewhat complicated character, which might give rise to obstruction in the House of Commons. On the otherhand, it was suggested that as the greater part of the Bill merelyreproduced the Clauses of the Scottish Act, which had been passed
s190in the preceding year, the House of Commons could not reasonablytake exception to it. The view was expressed, however, thatopposition might be encountered notwithstanding, on political grounds.The Committee agreed That further consideration of the matter should be postponed for a week in order that enquiries into the provisions of theBill might be made by the Treasury and other Depart-ments concerned.Agriculture Bill. 4. The Committee had under consideration a Memorandum bythe Minister of Agriculture (C.P.-2646), covering the draft of a Billto correct drafting errors in Section 12 of the &quot; Agriculture Act,1920,&quot; aud the first Schedule to that Act, and also to provide forthe appointment of additional members of the Central AgricultureWages Committees for Scotland and Wales. It was explained tothe Committee that the Central Wages Committees consisted of an equal number of representatives of emploj^ers and employed, theChairman having the casting vote. The only additional membersthat might be appointed were two women, with the result that, ifsuch were appointed, women would have a preponderant influence on the independent section of the Committee. The additional members and the Chairman were paid, and the appointment of two new members would involve an additional charge of. between 100Z.and 150Z. A Financial Resolution in the House of Commons would therefore be necessary.The Secretary for Scotland drew attention to an amendmenthe desired to Clause 10 of the &quot; Agriculture Act of 1920,&quot; dealingwith the Procedure in Arbitrations relating to Disputes about Bent.It appeared that it was not clear whether this could be considered as a purely drafting amendment which would not give rise to opposition in Parliament.The Committee agreed (i.) That Clause 1 of the Bill containing only drafting amend-ments to the :&apos; Agricultural Act, 1920,&quot; be approved,(ii.) That Clause 2 relating to the appointment of additionalpersons to the Central Agricultural Wages committees for Scotland and Wales should be dropped,(iii.) That the Minister of Agriculture should arrange for theintroduction in the House of Lords of the Bill thusamended, provided that (a.) The Secretary for Scotland, on further enquiry,agreed to the abandonment of Clause 2 ;(6.) That agreement was reached between the secretar&apos;&apos;for Scotland and the Minister of Agriculture onthe subject of an amendment to Clause 10 of&quot; The Agriculture Act, 1920 &quot; ; and(c.) Iu the event of the Secretary for Scotland notagreeing to abandon Clause 2 of the Bill, or no agreement being reached in regard to clause 10 of &quot; The Agriculture Act, 1920,&quot;the Bill be referred back to the Committeefor further consideration.
Collection and 5. With reference to Cabinet 40 (20), Conclusion 6, the Com-,-*.SesS^ni ^on 0^        mittee   had   under   consideration a letter from the Government *!&apos;Official statistics.      Actuary (C.P.-2566), covering the report of a Committee, who hadbeen directed by the Cabinet to report on (a.) The need for enquiry into certain defects in official statisticsalleged in a petition to the Prime Minister in November1919 from a Committee of the Royal Statistical Society,business men and others.(&amp;.) The proposal to set up a permanent Consultative Committeeon the statistical work of Government Departments.Sir Alfred Watson&apos;s Committee reported (1.) That the allegations in the petition are based on amisapprehension of the functions of Government withregard to statistics which are, to a great extent, limited by considerations of the utility of the information forthe purposes of Government by the cost of obtaining itand by the nature of the enquiries involved in itscollection ;(2.) That these iimitations will exist unless and until it is accepted as the duty of the Government to providestatistical information on all subjects ;(3.) That the petition is accordingly misconceived, and therefore no enquiry should be held into the system of official statistics;(4.) That the present machinery for the co-ordination of official statistics is capable of improvement, and that a permanentCommittee should be set up by the Cabinet-withoutexecutive duties on which each of the principal Depart-ments should have one representative, the Scottish Officeand Irish Office having three each.The Committee should be authorised to advise on questions submitted- by Departments, and to have powerto initiate discussion and to make recommendations tothe Department concerned through its representative onthe Committee, but to have no power to make recom-mendations to any central authority ;(5.) That the report should be published as a Stationery Officepublication.The H.A.C. agreed-(i.) To approve the report of Sir Alfred Watsobs Committee ;(ii.) That the question of publication of the report should be postponed till a later meeting provided that if on enquiryit were found that the cost of publication would be smallthe chairman of the H.A.C., in consultation with the.    . Financial Secretary to the Treasury, should be authorised, to sanction publication.2, Whitehall Gardens. S.W. I,March 9, .1921.
