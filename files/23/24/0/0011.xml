(1) With reference- to-Cabinet &quot;1 (21), Conclusion .3.  the..Cabinet, had before them, in addition to the documents beforthem at the previous meeting, a Memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs stating the present position i;regard to the Report of Lord Milner&apos;s Special Mission to egypt, &amp;nd ashing the Cabinet to  come to an early  (preliminary)  decision, on the subject (Paper C,P.-2.589) ;    and also aMemorandum by the  Secretary of State for the Coloniesdeprecating any alteration of the existing status ef Bgyptuntil after the matter had been considered by the imperial cabinet in June (Paper 0.P..-2612) .The Secretary cf State for Foreign Affairs, havingbriefly summarised the salient features of his Memorandum,read to the Cabinet,  and invited their views on, the  follow-ing formula for a declaration to the Sultan of Egypt-, whichhad been suggested by Lord All^nby:-&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government, after a study of theproposals made by Lord Milner, have arrived atthe conclusion that the status of protectorate&quot; is not a satisfactory relation in which Egypt-should continue to stand to Great Britain.While they have not reached final decisionswith regard to Logd Milner&apos;s recommendations,they desire to confer regarding them with anofficial delegation, nominated by the Sultan,with a view,  if possible,   to substitute forthe protectorate a treaty of alliance whichwould, while  securing the-special interestsof Great Britain and enabling her to offeradequate guarantees to foreign Powers, meetthe legitimate aspirations of Egypt and theEgyptian people&quot;.While admittine misgivings in regard to some importantdetails of the Report of the Special Mission,  the Secretaryof S&apos;f-ate for Foreign Affairs warmly supported the twoessential features of Lord Allenby&apos;s formula, viz.,(a) that the status of protectorate is nota satisfactory relation in which egypt should continue  to stand to Great Britain,and(b) the proposed substitution c&apos;&quot; a Treaty of alliance which would still retain Egyptwithin the British Imperial 3ystHe urged that these preliminary steps should be adopted
and the recurrence cf disorder.Doubts were expressed as to the urgency for action.In this connection attention was  called to Lord Allenbv&apos;telegram No.Ill of February 19th,  1920, as indicating animprovement in the situation in Egypt itself.    The generalsituation of tho British Empire was,  on the whole,  improving..Such an incident as General Smuts&apos; victory in South Africa&apos;added a certain moral strength.    Advantages might4 it wassuggested, be obtained by giving time for matters to arrangethemselves.      Attention was called to the fact that thePrime Minister and Lord Milner had made it perfectly clearthat the Government and Parliament were not committed tothe s chore,,While the first part of Lord Allenby&apos;s formula,indicating that  &quot;the status of protectorate is not a satis-factory relation&quot;, etc, did not meet with serious criticism,it was generally agreed that it would be a mistake to pre-jucl ge the future decision by going so far as to offer to substitute for the protectorate a Treaty of Alliance.    Thouse of the word &quot;Treaty&quot;,  it was  held, would be certain to lead, at this stage, to much misunderstanding in tho minds of the Egyptians and of the British electors,In this connr-ction, Lord Milner, who had been speciallyinvited to attend this meeting of the Cabinet, laid stress onthe  adoption of a treaty basis in contradistinction toregulation of Egyptian affairs  from abo^e by Great Britain.The basis of our relation must be that it was bi-lateraland not unilateral.    He was in agreement that Egypt shouldbo effectively within the ring-fence of the British Empire,but their status must not be that of a British Dominion.Egyptians hod no desire to become British subjects.    they wished us to recognise their own nationality and not attemptto confer British nationality upon them.    In his view thepresent moment was a favourable one  for stating our attitude.M vp. did not tako advantage of it the present relativelyfavourable situation might deteriorate,  and six monthshence,  if nothing wore done,might become thoroughly bad.
The British Government would be bound tn permit tho meetingat an early date of the legislative Assembly which the&apos;&quot;had themselves created -arid&apos;hvhlch. had. been^suspended&quot;for-fiveyears.   Unless the position of the British Government wasmade clear before its assembly, its. first step would be topass a resolution in support of Zaghlul Pasha.   While urgingan immediate statement of our position, Lord Milner did not insist on the immediate abolition of the protectorate.After considerable discussion as to the preciseformula to be employed, in the course of which Lord Milnerpressed strongly for the retention of the word &quot;Treaty&quot;,though not &quot;Treaty of-Alliance&quot;,  it was decided to adoptLord Allenby&apos;s formula, with the omission of the word&quot;official&quot; before &quot;delegation&quot;, and the substitution of&quot;relationship&quot;  for &quot;treaty cf alliance&quot;.The Cabinet approved the following formula,and the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs undertook to communicate it toLord Allenby:-. S.        &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government, after a study of theproposals made by Lord Milner, have arrived atthe conclusion that the status of protectorateis not a satisfactory relation in which egypt should continue to stand to Great Britain.While they have not reached final decisionswith regard to Lord Milner&apos;s recommendations,they desire to confer regarding them with a delegation, nominated by the Sultan, with aview,  if possible,  to substitute for the protectorate a relationship which would,while securing the special interests cfGreat Britain and enabling her to offeradequate guarantees to foreign Powers, meetthe legitimate aspirations of Egypt and theEgyptian peop1e.&quot;

(1)    With reference to Cabinet 72(20), Appendix iii,W-i ^^ier-tak-en- to meet-an influential Agricultural.tio-n that afternoon on the question of the pricoa to be-jiaaiffr-r home-grown wheat, paid&apos;he thought it very *esiraile thatthe. question should be considered by the Conference..He took the opportunity rf welcoming tflr A, GriffithBeacawen as- Minister of Agriculture, and referred to. theMinister&apos; a. eminent services in connection with the passage through the House of Commons of the Agriculture Bill.The Minister of Agriculture said that he wished tothe Conference the farmers&apos; point of view of the difficultieswhich had arisen.   Last March^ in consequence %f a cabinet decision, the maximum price for hfroergrown wheat had been raised from 76/- to 95/- per quarter of 60A lbs.    On March12th the Prims Minister had given the following pledge in theHouse of Commons:-&quot;St long as wheat ie still controlled and thereby deprived of a fsreemarket, the controlled price of home-grown wheat of sound milling quality harvested in 1920 .shall be-the monthly average (c,i.f,) price3f imported wheat of similar or comparablequality, provicLe&amp; that the price .so paii to     ;the home grower shall not exceed &apos;95/- per quarter of  04 lT*s%   -In pursuance ef these arrangements the millers had been instructed to raise the maximum price payable frr home-grown ...wheat to 95/^^ and up tc November 6, 1920, the farmex had actually received **5/-.   About that date, world prices showeisigns of falling and millers ceased to aacumuSaate wheat, whilethe farmer began to force his wheat on the market.    In theresult, u any farmers had in point of fact sold wheat below95/- between November 6th and January 26, 1321, the $ate on    -;&apos; decontrol of wheat was announced..which the/      &apos; &quot; 9 The farmers&apos; contended that they had a guaranteed price, but the true position wasthat the 9:5/- was only guaranteed so, long as twi. conditions were satisfied:       -V &apos;
(i)  That wheat was otill controlled and thereby deprived of a free market:(ii) That the world price was in excess of95/-.In point of fact, the pledge given by the Prime minister had not been carried cut between November 6 and January 26,   &quot;for the reason that no adequate machinery existed to secure its fulfilment.The farmers claimed to be paid the difference in price between the amounts actually realised in sales betweenNovember 6 and January 26 and 9 5/-.    The aggregate amount ofthis difference was estimated at between  120,000 and  15Of,DObut it must be remembered that payment of this sum would notthe wholfi of the farmers 1get rid of/ grievance, inasmuch as manyfarmers had tried t** make sales during the period but had failed.In addition to the above-named claim,  the farmershad a farther claim based on an answer given by himself (SirA.  Griffith Boecawen)  on April 19. 1920, which had beenPrepared in consultation with the f&amp;vort OonrJLsai; n . and whichwas intended to amplify and explain the Prime Minister&apos;s jpledge on March 12th.    This reply read as follows:-&quot;rhe price to be paid for British wheat fgiof eouvd milling quality will be announced   ifeach month and will be the average of thee.i . f.cost of all milling wheat importedduring the two preceding months and of theactual and anticipated arrivals in theUr.it.ed Kingdom during&apos; the current month,subject  to an adjustment in respect ofthe lower percentage of flour of equalwater content obtainable from h^-me-grown-heat as compared with imported wheat,,and subject also to a maximum of 9 5/- a.quarter.   Home-grown wheat of sound millingquality will be defined as wheat   of fair ;-faverage quality for the season fit formilling into flour mr human consumption.In reply to the specific enquiries in thequ-stion, the term rsimilar or comparablequality&apos; refers to the percentage of flourObtainable, and the prices will be adjustedaccordingly.    Consequently, in view of thefact that British wheat yields on the averagea somewhat lower percent-ntage of flour of equalwater content than imported wheat, the maximum price of 9 5/- will be payable for- british wheat so long as the average price of imported wheat is in excess of that figure&quot;.
The teera contended that wheat was still controlled so longas the mills were controlled, so long as there was a fixedprice for fl*ur, and so&apos;- long as the Government prescribedthe extraction percentage, and that,this -Seeing so, they (the farmers) were entitled to the benefit *f the bi-monthly average cost of imported&apos; milling wheat price arrangementsIndicated in the last-named pledge.-v*n the assumption that,OC0,OCO quarters of wheat of -the 192* har\e st remained inthe hands of the farmers,&apos; the maximum cost to the Exchequer ofnot be likely toagreeing to this second claim would/amount to        more than 1,500,000, and might be substantially less.The .Prime Minister stated that the imp ess ion left onhis mind o^ the previous discussions was that the government did intend to guarantee the farmer 95/- for this 1920 hardest,the idea being to give him every inducement to maintain and extend the cultivation of wheat.    There was no doubt that farmers generally had read the Government pledge s as guaran-teeing them v$5/- for this harvest.    The farmer was a verysuspicious individual, and if he got the idea that he wasbeing deceived or tricked, the consequences might be veryserious, and the great hopes of increased agricultural pros-perity, based on the Government&apos;s agricultural policy, mightbe doomed tf* disappointment.    vThile he was disposed to agreethat the words used did not in fact amount to an absoluteguarantee, he was inclined to think that the best policy would be to admit the justice of the claims.    It was perfectlynotclear that the conditions of his pledge of March. 12th had/been satisfied in the case of the period .November 6 to January 26,and the Government would in any case have to pay the differenceon any. sales within that period up to 95/-*.Ohjection - as taken to a policy of complete surrender,on the ground t&quot;--at there had been considerable misrepresentations-tion about the farmers&apos;  case.    For example, the farmers hadalleged that the mills were so over-stocked with wheat thatthe millers had been unable to buy., and that so far from the .
farmers haying held up wheat for higher prices, they had beenplacing large quantities on the market.,-    These statements were incorrect..,    Since October last,, the stocks of imported wheatat-the mills had been steadily going down, and on February lstp 1921were lower than they had been for three years*     The ho^e grown wheat crop of 1920 was an unusually small sns, but the percentageof this crop sold to date was actually higher than in 1919.So far from- the /Wheat Commission having squeezed the farmers,the reverse was the Case, and the farmers had been allowed toaverage sales of wheat to the millers, with the result that Insome cases more than 9.5/- a quarter had been paid.It was then suggested that, possibly some compromise mightbe reached with the. farmers on the larger claim, and it waspointed out that under no. reading, of the pledges could it becontended that the farmer should receive 95/- if the c. 1. fcost of imported wheat fell below that figure.On the other hand, it was generally agreed that&apos; theGovernment would have to abide by the Prime.Minister1s pledgeas extended and interpreted by-Sir A. Griffith Boscawen^sanswer in the House of Commons on April 19th,. 1920, and that&apos; Itwould be Inequitable to repudiate the latter arrangements,which had been designed to help the Government oh a risingmarket, when in point of fact the conditions were reversedand the arrangement had turned out unfavourably tc the StatecUnder the. scheme,, the price payable for this month*s wheat, -based on the average of December and January and March would bo95/-, while the price for next April and following months would probably be below 95/-The Conference were then reminded of the great practical     -difficulties which would arise if in effect the Government ga^ea guaranteed 95/&apos;- to every farmer who sold his wheat before January26, and refused the same figure oo- farmers who, by design oraccident,, had not effected sales until after that date.    Inany case, there might be a rush.of selling, with no purchasers,and/
and this might necessitate the setting up of some central machinery for the purpose of the State acquisition of the-crop^The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the conference that he would have the greatest possible difficulty infinancing such an operation.     He thought it most deplorablethat it should be necessary to contemplate the continuedcontrol of the flour mills until September next in order to market the 1920 home-grown wheat; and he was assured that every effort was being made to bring this control to an end,but that the millers, who had the benefit of the agreementwith the Government, had hitherto refused any substantial modification of the terms of that agreement, and it seemed probable that nothing could be done to accele-spate itsexpiration before June 30th next.The Conference agreed -.-.(a) That the Prime Minister, who was to be accompaniedby Sir A. Griffith Boscawen. ford Crawford, and aRepresentative of the Ministry of good, should endeavour to negotiate the best &quot;pocsible settlement,with the farmers: represented!vesgenerally on thelines indies.tod in the foregoing discussions(b) That; in particularv the fvrnmrs should be assured of the intentren of the Government tc carry cut the pledges given,  in a generous spirit, and thatthey should be requested to cc-operate with theGovernment concerned in devising the best kindof machinery by which the pledges could, be implemented.
(2)    The Conference were informed by Mr. Balfour that, atthe request of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,ho had had a lengthy interview with Prince Sapieha and thePolish Charge d&quot;Affaires, in the course of which the dis-cuss ion turned on the question of Dayeig.    It should horemembered that, under the Treaty of Versailles, Dansighad been separated from Germany and from Poland, and had&quot;been placed under the League of Nations, which had appointedS High OoBKiissior.er to under take the general administrationOf.tho plaoo.    Under the Versailles Treaty, Danzig had tonako a special Treaty with Poland^    That Treaty had infact been drawn up and signed, bu-fc as yet had not been ratified by the Poles.    At the recent meeting of the council at Geneva.,, the question was raised of giving Poland a mandateto defend Danzig.   This piSC&amp;osal, which was supported bythe French, was, of ooarsa, misconoeivsd in its origin,since there haI never heen say intention of applying the mandates system to any European territories.    In suport ofthe proposal there was produced to the Council, the Reportof a Technical Commission nfoioh had rooommended that poland should have&apos; the right to erect an aerodrome within three miles of Dan-sig, and also to fortify tho town against possibility-ble attacks.   Mro Balfour said that he had strongly&quot;pposedthis. suggestion in the Council, feeling sure that In so doing.ho was voicing the views of the Foreign Office and the.British Government.    He had pointed out that the suggest edmandate for Danzig was quite irregular, and that the proper course was for the two, oomrunities to endeavour to livepeaceably side by side,    his opposition had somewhat aston-ished his colleagues in the Council? who had bh-o&amp;gkt thatthe proposal would go-- through without any criticism.    In theend it was agreed that the High Commissioner for Danzigshould be asked to report on the proposal.    The Report had&quot;been received, and was. understood to be very unfavourable to the Polish contentions.   This being the position, Prince
Sapieha had told him that the Poles would never have signed the Treaty with Danzing if they had not been informed by the French that they would be given this mandats as a matter of course and that no objection on the part of Great Britain was to be apprehended. He (Mr Balfour) had pointed out to Prince Sapieha that the adoption of the proposal would involve Poland in most serious difficulties with Germany, and that the polish proposal seemed to him most unwise, whether considered from a military or a political point of view. It then became clear that the Polish Government was not anxious to defend Danzing in the event of an attack, but to ? Danzing and its inhabitants. Prince Sapieha had stated that last summer, when Poland was in the midst of a serious crisis, the strike at Danzing had only been overcore by the help of British sailors. Similar difficulties might happen again, and Poland would have no security that the only open port at her disposal might not at any moment be shut by one of her enemies. Mr Balfour said that he has assured Prince Sapieha that he would be quite ready to examine any safe-guards which Poland might wish to propose, or, if necessary, to strengthen any existing safeguards. Subsequently he had taken Prince Sapieha over to the Foreign Office, and the whole question had been further discussed with Sir Eyre Crowe and Sir Cecil Hurst. Prince Sapieha had again stated that Poland had only signed the Treaty on the district understanding that she should have the mandats, and ? ? added, though without intending to be miniatory, that he felt confident he would have the utmost difficulty in persuading the Polish Diet to ratify the Treaty unless he could give satisfactory assurances respecting respecting the mandats.

(At this point the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and Sir Eyre Crowe ?.)


At a Meeting of the1 Council of Ambassadors in Paris a Resolutionhad been passed to the effect that the League of Ha felons might..consider conferring a &quot;mandate&quot; upon Poland In the event ofan attack being made on Danzig,     He explained that somemisapprehension had arisen owing to the use of the word&quot;mandate&quot;, the sense in which the French, word &quot;Mandate&quot;,- -had been employed in the Recommendation of the Conferenceof Ambassadors did not correspond at all to the English &quot;mandate&quot;in the Articles of the&apos;Covenant.,     It simply meant &quot;authority&quot;.The French: view certainly was that Poland should be informed now that, in the event of an attack on Danzig, she. would be .regarded as the Natural defender of the town and ought to makeher military preparations accordingly.It was pointed out that from a military, point of view this might be&apos; an absurd suggestion, inasmuch as itpresupposed that the best/way of defending Danzig would be by.putting Polish troops into the town.      It w as. quite clear thatthe Polish Govornment..really wanted to send troops into Danzignot. for purposes of defence, but In order to prevent strikes and to coerce the inhabitants..The Conference agreed --That, in dismissing   the question of Danzigwith Prince Sapieha, the Prime minister should-generally support the views on thisquestion which had been given by Mr.. Half ourto the Conference.2,. Whltehal 1 Gardens, S.J?, 1.2.1st February, 19.21.
