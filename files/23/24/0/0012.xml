Cabinet-ba-1 before them a Memarandnm by the Chief Secretaryfor Ireland, asking for a number cf decisions in regurl tothe bringing into operation of the Government&quot;of ireland act (Paper C*P.- 641).Tho first question discussed was as &quot;to whether the ulster Parliament should be set up in advance-of the southern parliament., or simultaneously.The Oabinet were Infarmel that the South and West ofIreland were not yet ready to -set up the Southern Parhiament-,whereas in Ulster the arrangements were well advanced.    Itwould be an embarrassment to Ul3ter to have to wait-until theSouth was ready.The Cabinet were reminded that the suggestion that the ulster Parliament should bo set up in advance of the southern parliament had been supported on the ground that it would-provide an example which would convince the South of theBritish Government * s dotormiiiation to proceed with the Actwould stimulate the Southand/to take advsiroag u of it.On the other hand it was urged that the proposal to separate widely the dates of the two elections, if carriedout, w.culd - be in direct contradiction of theGovernment&apos;&apos; 0 avowed policy i?f giving an equal chance to theNorth and South.   While a simultaneous election on the same day in Ulster and in the South was not pressed for, onepolicy suggested was that the interval should be a. very short one.    To  carry out this policy the Parliaments mightbe summoned by an Order which would apply to both Parliaments,and would state that they were to be summoned-.    Then proclama-tions might follow &quot;fixing separate dates for the two Parlia-ments.Another policy discussed was to name the name date for both Parliaments.    If the South -of Ireland did not takeadvantage of the opportunity, the summoning of the Southern
lerliament should he postponed, either for three years or for\       some shorter period.A third plan was deliberately to postpone the summon-ing of the Southern Parliament, on the ground that the stateof public order in the South of Ireland was too disturbed to warrant it&apos;.It was pointed out that it would be very inconvenientto postpone the issue of the proclamation of the Ulster Par-liament beyond the end of April, owing to the provocativecharacter of the provincial celebrations held in July.      Itwas undesirable that these should, coincide with the meetingof the Ulster Parliament.After a further discussion the Cabinet agreed(a) That there should be one appointed day - inthe first week in May - for bringing intof**rce the provisions ralating to the twolarliamebtsifb) That the necessary administrative arrange-ments should be proceeded with so ss toensble the above programme to be carriedtut, the precise time-table to be submittedlater to the Cabinet by the Chief secretary:(c) That the Chief Secretary should confer withthe prime Minister in the matter of the newappointments to the offices of Lord Lieuten-e.al and Lord Chancellor.-2-
I &apos; 1pHAKXSTAJN. (2) With reference to Cabinet 66 (20i , Conclusion S,  theCabinet were reminded by the Secretary of State for india that for some time a Mission from the Government of India,under Sir H. Dobbs, Foreign Secretary to the Government ofIndia, had been in Kabul negotiating a Treaty with afghanistan-stan.    The Afghans were also about to ratify a Treaty withthe Bolsheviks, which,  from secret information, we knew wouldprovide for the establishment of Bolshevist Consulates atplaces near the Indian Frontier, including Kandahar andJellalabad, in return for which the BolsheViks were togive Afghanistan an annual subsidy of  100,000 and certainwar material, including 13 aeroplanes, anti-aircraft guns, a wireless station, 5,COO rifles, and a smokeless-powderplant.    The Afghans, however,  declared that they would)       enter into no Treaty harmful to Indian interests,  and sir h. Dobbs had insisted that there must be no foreign Oonsu-lates in the neighbourhood of the Indian Frontier;On these issues a difference of opinion had developedbetween the India Office and the Indian Government.    the india Office considered&apos; that no Treaty could be signed withAfghanistan until they were convinced that the Tie aty withthe Soviet Government contained nothing harmful.    TheGovernment of India and Sir E. Dobbs, on the other hand, held that there was no need for a disclosure of the BolshevistTreaty with Afghanistan, since our Treaty provided amplesa-^equards and all the protection that a paper Treaty could;events would show which side the Afghan Government intendedto back.    If,  in practice,  they signed and carried out the bolshevist Treaty, we should at once denounce our Treaty.Moreover, the Indian Government laid stress on the probabil-ity that a breaking off of negotiations would &quot;be followed byan outbreak o^ war with Afghanistan.    The Secretary of Statefor India added that, from a study of the proceedings ofSir H. Dobbs&apos; Mission, it was clear that the Afghan Sovernim
had cold-shouldered the Bolsheviks and had treated our Missionwith every respect, although this might he merely a method ofconcealing their real intention.    The Secretary of State forIndia than read to the Cabinet a draft telegram (Paper C.P.-2665) which he proposed, if his colleagues agreed, to send toIndia.Lord Reading, who had been specially invited to attend theCabinet, emphasized that throughout the negotiations the Amirhad avoided disclosing the terms of the secret Treaty, whichjwith its subsidy, the provision of Consulates and the promise of armaments, was obviously directed against our Indian inter-ests..   The two Treaties were inconsistent and incompatible.If we informed the Amir that we would not continue the dlscus-sions unless the details of the Bolshevist Treaty were dls-closed, he might think better of it and decide to prefer the certainty of the 20 lakhs of rupees offered by/the Indian Gov-emment, to the uncertain advantages offered by the Bolsheviks.In the subsequent discussion stress was laid on the extentof the concessions we had offered to the Amir, including theraisins, of the 3ubsxdy from 10 to 20g lakhs, and, above all,the surrender of/our control over Afghan foreign policy, all ofwhich justified us in insisting on a substantial quid pro cud.$The utmost emphasis was laid on the strong objection to per-*.mitting Afghanistan to accept a subsidy from Russia, directed against Indian interests,  as well as from India. Exception wasalso taken to the admission of the right of the Amir to exer-cise a direct interest in Tribes on oar side of the Border.There was general agreement that the telegram to india should make it clear that no dual subsidy could be contemplateand that certain passages should be re-drafted to bring out this point.The Secretary of Statn for India protested against being asked to veto absolutely the possibility of a double subsidy.The Cabjjh^t *also considered the possibility, contemplated by the&apos; Government of India,, of an outbreak of war with
Afghanistan in the event of a breaking off of negotiations.

This was not unanimously accepted as certain, more particularly in view of the issue of the recent hostilities, the blow struck against Afghanistan by aircraft of a somewhat antiquated type and the improvement in the quality of the aircraft now available. in India. On the other hand. it was urged that, in view of our military obligations elsewhere, it might be preferable to tolerate a Russian subsidy for the present rather that incur the risk of the heavy expense of a fresh frontier war.

Subsequently (after the withdrawal of the Prime Minister to keep another appointment) there was some discussion as to the exact course the negotiations were likely to take at Kabul, at the order in which the two Troaties would be handled. There was general agreement that ? Dobbs should not sign a Treaty with the Afghans until the Cabinet had had an opportunity of considering the terms of the Soviet Treaty, and particularly the question of subsidies.

The re-drafting of the telegram to the Viceroy. in accordance with the foregoing discussion. was committed by the Cabinet to -

The Secretary of State for India,

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Lord ?

A copy of the telegrams as subsequently despatched is set out in Appendix I.

(3) The Cabinet had before them a Memorandom by tho Minister of Health dealing with a proposal for an Annual Register of Voters. (C.P.2618.

The Leader of the House of Commons on the 15th November 1920, had undertaken to introduce legislation for an annual register if the measure commended itself to tho House, and since that date 270 members had declared themslves in favour. This widespread support had probably been greatly influenced by the announcement which had also been made, in answer to questions, that by means oi an annual register there would be a saving of  £700,000. Subsequent examination had shown that the saving would not be more than  £250,000, and that there was strong opposition to the proposal in many quarters outside the House,  especially in Scotland, where all parties were against it unless it accompanied by a supplemental list and to this there were a number of serious objections. In anycaso no change possible would be applicable before the spring of next year.

The Cabinet agreed to request the Minister of Health to obtain the views of tho Government Whips on the proposal in the light of the above considerations, with special reference to the attitude of the House of Commons and of tho political agents of the various parties.
jNSUlT IF (4) The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the1CDUCTHN.President of the Board of Trade dealing with proposals te&apos;take immediately a partial census of production in respect&apos;ef the output of factories, etc., in 1920 (Baper G.P.-25?^) and a Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequeropposing such a census (Paper CP.-2555) on the ground notrnly that it was partial but that inddstrial and monetaryconditions in the year 1920 were highly abnormal.   Further,such a census, owing to the omission of Agriculture, wouldbe of no value in determining the relative taxable capacityof Ireland.   There was, in the view of the Chancellor of theExchequer, less objection to -a complete census for 1921, inwhich year the census of population would take place.It was urged on behalf of the 3oard of Trade that wewere in great ignorance of the present producing capacity ofthe nation&apos;8 industries in comparison with our pre-war position, and that the preparations for the partial censuswere far advanced.    Draft schedules for a large number of trades had been circulated to Trade Associations and chambers of Commerce, and representations had been made quite recentlyby the&apos; Federation of British Industries in favour of proceed-ing.   The partial census would cover about 70 per cent, ofour manufactures.After     further discussion the Cabinet agreed  That the partial census  for 1920 should be dropped, and that the Board of Trade shouldbe authorised to proceed with the arrange-ments for holding in 1922 a census of pro-duction for 1921.
ftOAIi MINES (5)--JWiiTh^3rffer^^ 1-ftvktdie^thjhinet had before them a draft of a Bill to curtailthe duration of, and amend, the Coal Mines (Emergency)    1Act, 1920, to the principle of which approval had alreadybeen given by the Cabinet on January 28, 1921    (Paper CP.-2663).The President of the Board of Trade explained the objects which it was proposed to secure&apos;by the Bill, andthe reasons  for taking twa periods for dealing with the pooling of profits.    The Coal Mines (Emergency) Act, 1920,as extended by the Mining Industry Act, 1920, pooled theprofits of the industry for the period April 1, 1919 -August 31, 1921.    If the pooled profits were greater thanthe aggregated pre-war profit standard   of the owners, each-owner was to receive from the pool an amount equal to hisown profit standard.    Farther, one-tenth of the surplusthe .of the pooled profits oveiyaggregated standards was to be divided amongst the owners according to an agreed schetaeof distribution.    If the pooled profits were less than theaggregated standards, such profits were to be distributedamongst the owners -in proportion to the standards of theindividual owners.    If the pooled profits amounted to lessthan nine-tenths of the aggregated standards, the deficitwas to be made good by the State insofar as it was due toany Order, Regulation, or Direction issued by the Controlleror by the Board of Trade after January 1, 192S.    Owing tothe abnormal depression which has arisen in the industry during 1921, it became clear that to continue the Billbeyond March 31, 1921, would involve the State in greatfinancial loss.    The Coal Mines (De-control) Bill seeks to terminate the financial control at March 31, 1921.    If itis carried it will limit the liability of the State to the 23,000,000 which will have been advanced at that date.    Ofthis  23,00^,000, certainly  19,000,000,and possibly thewhole amount, will be recovered during 1921-22 and 1922-23.-8-
The Bill gives effect to a-pledge given to the owners at thetime of the strike settlement&apos; when they agreed that theirftne-tenth of the surplus profita should vary up or dcwnwith the miners&apos; output bonus.    It was agreed that the varia-tion should apply to the period during which the output bonusvaried, i.e,, the months of January, February and March, 1921.This variation involved the division of the pool into twoat December 31, 1920.    The owners have agreed to waive their claim to one-tenth of the surplus in both pooling periods.The Bill provides,, therefore,&apos;, that  (a) In the first pooling period to December 31,1920, they should receive ten-tenths oftheir standards.(The profits of the industry are jufficient to provide this sum and toleave a surplus of approximately  15,000,000to  15,,000,000 after debiting the cost ofControl.)(b) In the second pooling period they shouldreceive nine-tenths of their standards.(This guarantee may involve the Stare inan amount of from  15,000,000.to  19,000,000,but the surplus of approximately&apos;- 15,000,000to  16,000.000 from the first pooling period will be&apos;available to me^t it,)The Bill also contains machinery for limiting the Statefinancial assistance to nine-tenths of the standards daringthe second pooling period (Clause 1 (iv)  ), effects certainconsequent repeals in the Emergency Act, and repeals Section f&apos;of the Mining Industry Act, 1920.The Cabinet approved the introductionof the Coal Mines (De-control) Bill..
Emergency Organisations

(6) With reference to Cabinet 4 (21), Appendix I (1), the Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Minister of Transoport, conveying tha recommendations of the Supply and Transport Committee with, reference to the organisation which it was desirable to maintain to cope with possible labour disturbances on a large scale (Saper C.P.2538). The cabinet also had before then a Memorandum by the Food Controller dealing with a similar emergency organisation at headquarters and in the Provinces for ensuring adequate supplies and equitable distribution of foodstuffs during any period when the ordinary channels of supplu and distribution were dislocated by reason of industrial disturbance (PaPer C.P.-2611). The estimated annual cost of the proposed skeleton machinery was £104,000, the chief items of which were - £85,000 for food services and £15,000 for wireless and other communications.

It was explained that subsequent negotiations which had taken place between the Ministry of Food and the Treasury had resulted in an agreement to reduce the £35,000 to £65,0G0, and, owing to the fact that a proportion of the officials required will have other duties not directly attributable to emergency work, this sum for the next financial year would be further reduced by £20,000.

The Cabinet endorsed the recommendations of the Supply and Transport Committee and of the Ministry of Food, subject to the expenditure for the next financial year not exceeding £64,000, and to the reconsideration of the whole question inthe Autumn.

It was further agreed-

That the form of the presentation of the Estimates for this expenditure should be determined by -

The Minister of Transport,

The Minister of Food,

The Financial Secretary to the Treasury.


5AILWAYS BILL.      (7)    The Cabinet approved the appointment of the follow-ing Committee to consider and report on the Draft RailwaysBill which was being prepared by the Ministry of Transport:-The Lord Privy Soal (Chairman)..The President of the Board of Trade (Chairmanin the absence of the Lord Privy Seal),The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Attorney- general,The Secretary of State for War,The Secretary of State for Home Affairs,The Minister cf Transport.vt T-r St,Q.. Fill (Secretary).m i.
Conclusion 2, the Cabinet- Irad-before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of 3&apos;:...to for War showing possible reductions in the tfatimaWs avdxadtted by Mr Churchill ( Igg^oOoaiaO) ,with a view to approaching the limit of  103^ 50CX GOG ....rv:Lddown at the last meeting of the Finance Commit toe (maper.F.C.-71).    The Secretary of State for War laid cmphasiy inhis Memorandum on the fact that such a figure coulu only bereached subject to a number of risks being undertaken by theCabinet.In the course of the discussien the Secretary ofState for War explained that broadly the Estimates were made up as fellows?- 68,000,000 normal expenditure, 10,0G0300O non-recurrent exosnditure, 28,500,000 grant-in-aid for the Middle East.The normal expenditure was roughly two and a half times thepre-war figure.   He had only succeeded in reaching &amp;1 OS v 509,00c.by reducing the Estimates for Mesopotamia and PaXoatxne -co 28,500,000 from  30,000,000.    In doing this he had discountedall possible reductions in the number of troops in theme two areas.    In his calculations he had only debited the pay ofthe troops to the Middle East, and not the overhead charges.If it proved to be possible to scrap a number of the Battalionsthere would be a corresponding reduction in depot and otherhome charges.The Cabinet were reminded that the course of the re go-tiations that day fitb the Germans incLiwste&amp;, a possibledespatch      wotp troops to the rhine, and it was also pointedout that the cost of maintaining troops in Ireland was con-siderably in excess of the original Estimate of  2,000,000.The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinetthat the arrangements which he had made with Mr Churchillprovided for the Colonial Office taking over, at a given date,the responsibility for the Middle Fast .troops and bearingtheir cost on the Colonial Office Vote as an appropriation-in-aid to the War Office.    The figure he had provisionally-12-
agreed with. Mr Cburchill Ahad been  30,000-, GOO out of a totalof  1065-00O,j000     In view 4f the efforts which the Secretarynt State for War was making, he did not wish tc press thepoint further, and he would accept the figure of  1065655,000as a maximum, on the understanding that the Secretary of Statffor far continued his efforts to secure every possible saving on the Estimates now submitted.    In particular, he hoped thatwhen any reductions were secured in the British and indian troops in &quot;Mesopotamia they would be struck off the strengthof the Army.Attention was drawn to the practice of supplyingcapital to the Territorial Associations by the Public &quot;vorkeLoan Board.    Fcr this purpose  200,000 had to be fcund thisyear, and it had not been included in the  106,500,000.Reference was also made to the French railway claims which, if they succeeded in full, would involve a charge onthe Estimates.    This, however, was thought to be highlyimprobable.The Secretary of State for War seid he oould onlyreduce the estimates to  106,665,000 on condition -(a) that about  200*000 was advanced to the Terr-itorial Associations   by the public Works LoanBoard, otherwise;the  200.000 would have to beadded to the estimates;(b) $hat the Frenoh-Railway claims so far as notpaid out of 1920/21 votes would not be chargedna War Offioe votes 1921/22.&apos; The Cabinet agreed to a maximum figure of 106,665,000 for tho War Office estimates for 1921/22, In the conditions stated:The Lstimates were approved also *m theassumption that the troops in the middle east will be substantially reduced before the end ofthe financial year.

APPENDIX I

Telegram from Secretary of State to Vicerey, Foreign Department,  dated 4th March 1921.

Clear the line

Your telegram dated 1st March, 207 A.Afghanistan.

There has, I think, been misunderstanding in regard to attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government towards question of Bolshevik subsidy. Subsequent telegrams wore not intended to be read as withdrawing from view expressed in my telegram dated 29th July, and we still strongly hold view that Bolshovik subsidy would in itself be strongest prime facie evidence of arrangements directed against British Government.

You now propose apparently despite everything that you know and we know of Bolshevik aims and aspirations, in the last resert sign a Treaty with tho Afghans without any disclosure of their arrangement with the Bolshevik Government and without any stipulation that the Afghans are not to receive money or arrms as presents from the Bolsheviks. I regret that I cannot assent. I leave it to you and Dobbs to decide in what order he should I waive tho question of foreign relations. If Afghan Government refuse to consider Dobb&apos;s proposal which prohibits Bolshevik consulates and Intrigue against us negotiations will clearly be at an end but evoe if they are disposed to accept these conditions tho Bolshevik Treaty must be asked for after an evidence of their good faith. It is ? to me that tho Bolsheviks are going to agree to pay the Afghans money from more ? of afghanistan. I cannot conceal from ? what the idea of a double subsidy finds little favour with H.M.&apos;s Government, and that its appearance in the Bolshevik Treaty would, I think, make the conclusion of our Treaty impossible. But in any case when the Afghans have disclosed the Treaty, even if Dobbs thinks that its terms justify him in continuing the negotiations, it must be telegraphed to me for the consideration of H.M.&apos;s Government. Meanwhile I must impress upon you strongly that you should not say or do anything which would appear to countenance the view that the Afghans could be allowed to receive a subsidy from tho Bolsheviks, if by a Treaty with us they were to receive a subsidy from us.

I regret if time has been lost, but however clearly we see the advantages of a Treaty and consequences of failure to conclude one, there is a point beyond which we cannot possibly go.

I assume that Treaty will be subject to ratification and that this will be stated in it.

The Secretary for Scotland raised, as a matter of urgency,the question of permitting&apos; or prohibiting a visit of ArchbishopMannix to Coatbridge, where he was announced to address twopublic meetings on Sunday, 27th February. The meetings werepromoted by Sinn Fein Clubs and it was estimated that, accordingto weather conditions, from 40,000 to 80,000 people may be present..The Archbishop had addressed a crowded meeting at Edinburgh on sunday last and there had been no disorder, and he was due to address a meeting at G-reenock last night, with the Provost in the chair. His speeches, while extravagant, could not be described as seditious! In the view of the local police authorities there was less risk of disturbance in allowing the meetings to be held than inprohibiting them. On the other hand, it was impossible with agathering of such dimensions to foretell what might happen. Thecourse usually taken by the Home Office had been to authoriseprohibition where the police and local authorities asked for it.Here that request was not made. In fact the local Chief Constabledid not think that the meeting should be prohibited. To prohibit the Coatbridge meetings would be likely to lead to riot and there wereneither police nor troops available in adequate numbers to suppressrioting on a large scale. In the event of a disturbance it was certainthat other discontented and unemployed elements would join forces with the Irish population.The Committee were agreed that the meetings should be allowedto take place.m 40ArchbishopMannix&apos;s Visit toCoatbridge.[5699 I
Legislation in thecoming Session.miscellaneous provisions Bill.Housing Subsidy.Other Provisions.Sanatorium Benefit.Water Charges.Borough FundsAmending Bill.Dentists Bill.ProprietaryMedicines Bill.2. The Committee had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Health (C.P.-2597) dealing with the introduction of bills promoted by the Ministry of Health in the light of the cabinets decision to keep legislation within the narrowest possiblelimits during the present session.(1.) After some discussion the Committee agreed (a.) That the Ministry of Health should proceed with a Billto continue the housing subsidy, which had formed partof the Ministry of Health (Miscellaneous Provisions)Bill, and should circulate a draft to the Committee ;(6.) That such of the other pi&apos;proposals in the miscellaneous provisions Bill as the Minister of Health might desireto pass into law should, provided they were non-controversial, be included in a separate measure to besubmitted to the Home Affairs Committee in due course.(2.)(3.)That the Ministry of Health should proceed with a Bill totransfer to County and County Borough Councils thepower to continue the provision for sanatorium treatmentof tuberculosis, and should circulate a draft to theCommittee ;That a draft of .a Water Charges Bill to enable certainwater companies to increase their charges, as had beendone in the ease of gas and tramways, should be circulatedto the Committee for consideration, together with astatement showing precisely the financial difficulties ofthe companies concerned ;(4.) That no action should be taken at present in regard to therecommendations of Sir Donald Maclean&apos;s Select Com-mittee to amend the Borough Funds Act. The Billrequires that the notice of a private Bill prior to thestatutory meeting of the electors should include astatement of the estimated expenditureprovisions of the Bill would entail. Thetook note of the different procedure whichin Scotland.(5.) That the Dentists Bill and Proprietary Medicines bill might be introduced in the House of Lords if there were any strong demand for them and if they were substantiallyagreed Bills. The Secretary for Scotland undertook toexamine the application of the Proprietary Medicines Billto Scotland.which theCommitteefollowedisRemoval of controlled prices for Imported Meat.3. The Committee had before them a Memorandum by the FoodController dealing with a proposal to remove control of prices of imported meat after the 31st March (C.P.-2542), together with aMemorandum&apos;by the Unrler-Secretary for the Colonies endorsing therecommendations of the Food Controller, on the ground thatdecontrol would have- a favourable effect on inter-Imperial relations(C.P.-2581).The Committee concurred in the proposal to remove all controlof imported meat on the 31st March, 1921.Business premises and the PentRestriction Act.4. The Committee had under consideration a Memorandum bythe Minister of Health (C.P.-2473), covering the Report of theSelect Committee on Business Premises, together with a Memorandumby the Secretary for Scotland (C.P.-2593). Section 13 of &quot;the rent Restriction Act, 1920,&quot; makes the provisions of that Act applyto Business Premises, but only until the 24th June of this year (inScotland the 28th May).
The Select Committee recommended a temporary schemeempowering a tenant to apply to a special tribunal for the pro-prolongation of his tenancy for not longer than June 1923, upon such terms as they consider just in the ciicuinstances.The Select Committee also recommended that a Committee of experts be appointed to consider the whole question of the relations of Landlord and Tenant of Business Premises with a view to permanent legislation.In the view of the Minister of Health the only practicalalternatives to allowing Section 13 of the Rent Restriction Actto run out in June were : (i.) To adopt the Committee&apos;s recommendations ; or(ii.) Forthwith   to   submit  proposals  of a   more  permanentcharacter.Merely to continue Section 13 of the Rent Restriction Act untilthe expiry of the whole Act in June 1923 would be opposed in bothHouses of Parliament.The Committee were impressed with the facts that thearguments in the Report of the Select Committee pointed to the expediency of terminating restrictions on the Rent of business premises at the earliest possible moment, and that the SelectCommittee&apos;s recommendations &quot;were entirely inconsistent with thearguments in the Report and with the evidence.The Home Affairs Committee were reminded that theirChairman had been strongly opposed to the extension of theprinciple of the Kent Restriction Act to business premises when thematter was considered by the Home Affairs Committee and bythe Cabinet in 1920, as being contrary to sound economic principles.Moreover, owing to the slump in trade, the temptation which mighthave existed some months ago for landlords to eject their tenantsin the expectation of receiving exorbitant rents on account of theboom in trade no longer existed. Business premises had been included in the Rent Restriction Act strictly on the understandingthat the Select Committee would advise on legislation of apermanent character. They had not done so, but had agreed on atemporary compromise inconsistent with the evidence submitted tothem.The Secretary for Scotland, on the other hand, was strongly in favour of adopting the recommendations of the Committee for setting up a Tribunal to hear the applications of tenants for the prolongation of their tenancies, and took the view that there wasno evidence before the Home Affairs Committee that the protectionof tenants of business premises, in Scotland at any rate, was any lessnecessary now than when the Act was passed. He did not think it waspossible to withdraw the protection that had been afforded to tenants.The matter was of special importance in the case of business premises,since a small tenant who was ejected and could not And alternative accommodation was not merely put to the inconvenience suffered by a domestic tenant, but was quite unable to carry on his business and liable to be ruined. While he agreed that legislation of this character was uneconomic, it was, in his view, as undesirable toallow it to expire in the case of business premises as in the case ofdwelling-houses, to which admittedly the Act would continue toapply until 1923.The Committee agreed, the Secretary for Scotland dissenting (1.) That the Government should not adopt the recommenda-tions of the Select Committee on Business Premises.(2.) That Section 13 of &quot;The Rent Restriction Act, 1920,&quot;applying that Act to Business Premises should beallowed to expire in due course on the 24th June, 1921(Scotland, the 28th May).

The Committee had under consideration a Memorandum byHospital Act, 1872. the First Lord 0f the Admiralty (C.P.--2326), covering&quot;the draft of aBill to amend the Greenwich Hospital Act of 1872. It was explained that the original draft Bill circulated to the Cabinet(C.P.-790J, had been discussed with the Treasury, who had agreed tothe draft now submitted. The Admiralty had power under the act of 1X72 to provide out of the funds of the Greenwich Hospital Trustfor the education of not more than 200 girls, the daughters ofwarrant officers, non-commissioned officers and men of the royal navy and Royal Marines ; the amount expended on the education and maintenance of any girl not exceeding the rate of 20L a year.In view of representations from school authorities that 201. a year under present conditions is inadequate, it was proposed in the bill submitted to remove the restriction on the amount.   There were atpresent 100 girls being educated at the expense of the fund theadditional cost would be about 1,500L a year. The restriction onthe number of-girls who might be educated, which it had beenoriginally intended to remove, would be retained.
