SAFEGUARDING (l) With reference to Cabinet 12 (21), ConclusionOP INDUSTRIESBILL. 5, the Cabinet had under consideration a draft of theResolutions to introduce the Safeguarding pf IndustriesBill (Appendix).As the result of consultation with the speaker of the House of Commons and the Chairman of Ways -and means, it had been found tuna voidable to Include in thefirst Resolution a list of the Key Industries, whichwould thus raise in an acute form one of the most contentions-tlous issues of the Bill.      It had also been ruled thatthe Resolutions must Include a definition of the term&quot;cost of production&quot;, and its inclusion would also be bound to lead to much controversy, inasmuch as the definition proposed was not &quot;cost of production&quot; asordinarily understood, but the wholesale selling price.It was suggested that &quot;foreign value&quot; might be substitutedfor &quot;cost of production&quot;, but this was strongly opposed on political grounds as a departure from the precise wordsused in the manifesto issued on behalf of the Coalitionat the last General Election^ which had been the basisof pledges given by Ministers in the constituencies.The Cabinet agreedTo retain the term &quot;cost of production&quot;and to approve the Resolutions as setforth in the Appendix,LIQUOR CONTROL.
