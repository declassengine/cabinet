I &quot;ISgRTO PRttSIA,        (1)  With Mi8&quot;ro;.c3 to tv^lnot .3* &quot;(W, Conclusion 4,  theCabinet had under consideration the question of the with-drawal of the British forces fro:-. Persia..The Cabinet were reminded that the decision to with-draw in the Spring of 1921 had been announced in both houses of Parliament..   Recently, however, as a result of discua-sions at the Finance Committee,  the question had arisen asto the possibility of an earlier withdrawal from- Persia aspart of a general scheme for the evacuation of the Mosuland Baghdad vilayets,  and the withdrawal of the troops inMesopotamia to a line covering Basra and the Persian oil-fields .Recent telegrams from the British Minister atTeheran (Mo.819 of December 17, 1920, and No.843 of Deceinbez31, 1920) had sade it clear that the General Officer corporation-..-manding in North Persia was under the impression thatGeneral Kaldane had received orders to effect&apos; an in-mediatewithdrawal of the I-Iorperforce, with a view to a subsequentretreat o^ the Mesopotamian forces to the Basra line,whereas in fact the question of the evacuation of any partof Mesopotamia had not as yet been decided by the Cabinet.The Secretary of State for Foreign -Affairs laid stres^on the consequences to our policy in Persia of a hastywithdrawal of the troops in advance of the date hitherto contemplated.    Premature withdrawal would involve the com-plete collapse of our influence in north Persia,  and might very well lead to a panic retreat, involving great sufferingand loss of life among civilians *    He asked that if anyorders    on the lines indicated in Mr Norman&apos;a teles:ran; No.809, of December SI, 1920, hadbeen sent, they might at onceb^ cancelled.The Secretary of State for v?ar stated emphaticallythat no such orders had &quot;been given.    The telegrams whichhad been sent to the Military Authorities in Mesopotamiahad merely been in the nature of enquiries.

Premature withdrawal would involve the coie-plete collapse of our influence in North Persia,  and might very well lead to  a panic retreat, involving great sufferingand loss of life among civilians a    He asked that if anyorders    on the lines indicated in Mr Norman&apos; s telegram No.809, of December 31, 19S0, hadbeen sent, the;; might at onesbe cancelled.The Secretary of State for tfar stated emphaticallythat no such orders had been given.    The telegrams whichhad been sent to the Military Authorities in Mesopotamiahad merely been in the nature of enquiries.
The Secretary of State for India referred to a tele-gram No,148.s, of January 2,  1021  (Paper G . P. -2412)  fromSir Persy Cox,  indicating that ho also was in a one doubt asto the precise position,  in view of apparent inconsistenciesbetween telfe grams received by him fro v. the India Office andtelesrra^-s received by Gsmral Haldane &apos;c&apos;rom the &apos;.7ar Office.In the subsequent discussion,  great stress was laid on the risk of maintaining, isolated,  at the end of a longline of communications, the small British .force in north persia, and on its high cost to the British taxpayer.    Thewithdrawal of the troops, which must in any case be under-taken before the melting of the ice on the Caspian,  exposedour forces to attack by the Bolsheviks, and ought to be pre-ceded by a continuous and systematic withdrawal of the civil-ian population from Teheran% and the Cabinet were ask&apos;-d togive a definite decision that General Ironside should forth-^ith warn the local European colony of our intention to commence the mi 111ary wif hidrawa 1 on April 1 at,, and toarrange for the retirement of those civilians who -tight wishto leave the  capital.In this connection the attention of the Cabinet was drawn to Foreign Office telegram No.5, of January 3, 1921, toMr Norman, which contained suggestions as to the withdrawalof the European population of Teheran,The Cabinet generally agreed that the suggestions in the last-named telegram were in conformity with theirpolicy, which aived at an orderly retreat of those civilianswho decided to leave, without any undue loss of time,  andthat the retirement of the civilians would In any case haveto b^ undertaken as a direct consequence of the decisionalready reached by the Cabinet to withdraw from NorthernPersia,  irrespective of any decision which might be taken as regards a withdrawal in Mesopotamia,The Chief of the Imperial General Staff explainedthat the confusion had arisen owing to the telegram which
had been sent on the hypothesis that the evacuation of north persia was to be undertaken in th-   Winter with a view tohastening a possible withdrawal in Mesopotamia to a linecovering Basra.   - General Haldane had replied that if hereceivei his instructions by January 7th. he could withdrawfro:&apos;:  Persia in the Winter months and be back at the Basraline by next July,   bailing the receipt of such instructionsby the date named, he could not get back to the Basra linebefore March, 192 2.After seme further discussion,  the Cabinet agreedThat identical instructions should beissued by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs and the Secretary ofState for War to the British Ministerat Teheran and General Haldane respect-ively, based on the following conclusions:-i(i)  The combatant troops in north persia should be in a positionto begin their actual withdrawalon April 1st:I   (ii) Prior to this date,  all -militaryimpedimenta should be withdrawn:(iii)  Civilians should be warned at once that if they wish to withdraw fromTeheran via Hamadan, they must leaveNorth Persia in time for the road tobe clear by April 1st:(iv)  All details  to be arranged between the British Minister at Teheran andI the General 0&apos;hficer Commanding in north Persia,MESOPOTAMIA. (S) With reference to Cabinet 32  (20),  Conclusion 4,  theThe Question &apos; Cabinet had before them a telegram (No.14 S,) dated Januaryof ShereefPeisal. 2,  1921,  from the High Commissioner in Mesopotamia,  giving further particulars of the political situation in mesopotamia and making certain suggestions regarding the proposal thatthe Shereef Peisal should be proposed as King of Irak(Paper CP.-2412) .In this connection the Secretary of State for PoreigrAffairs informed the Cabinet of a recent conversation- between Lord Hardinge and kU Leygues, the French PribeMinister, on this subject, in the course of which M. Leygueshad raised strong objections to the candidature of Shereef
Feisal which,  in hie view, would arouse a storm of indigna-tion in France.After some discussion the Cabinet agreed  To postpone any decision on the questionpending the making of further enquiries   .by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs into various aspects of thematter.(3) With reference, to Cabinet 82  (2C) , Conclusion 3, theCabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs suggesting certain modifications in thescheme contained in the Report of the Special Mission to egypt (Paper C,P.-8349), and making certain proposals as tothe procedure to be adopted regarding the publication of theReport and the negotiations with the Delegation to be sentto England by the Egyptian Government  (Paper CP.-2408) .The Cabinet were askrd that no immediate decision should be taken on the question of principle which had been expressly reserved at the meeting referred to above.    In viewof the great interest taken by the Dominions  (particularly by australia)  in this matter, as shown by Mr Hughes&apos; telegram ofNovember 18, 1920 (Paper CP.-2158) ,  and having regard tothe losses sustained by the Dominion troops in the defence ofEgypt during the War, it was urged that the Cabinet shouldcore to no conclusion on the main question of principle until after a discussion at the Imperial Cabinet next summer.The question was then raised an to how far the conductby the Egyptians of their own foreign policy was an essential part of the proposals of the Special Mission.lord Milner pointed out that up to 1914 egypt had had its own Foreign Minister and Foreign Offiee, though net itsown independent Diplomatic Service,    Foreign, countries had had tbmir own diplomatic representatives in Egypt, who dealtdirectly with the Egyptian.Foreign Office,    In theory theBritish &quot;Agent and Consul-general&apos; was nothing more than oneof these representatives,,  and not even necessarily the chiefo^ .t^em.    in Sir Eldon Gorst&apos;.s time the British Consul-Genera^
not being the doyen of the Service, had not taken officialprecedence over his foreign colleagues.    Under the proposed treaty, on the other hand,  the British representative inEgypt would always have recognised precedence.    He would,therefore, actually be in a higher position than any british representative in the past until the declaration of the protectorate in 1914, and that by the act of the Egyptiansthemselves.    Lord Milner regarded the conduct by the Egypt-ians of their own foreign policy as fundamental to the scheme in the sense that the essence of the scheme lay in the pro-posed Treaty, and it will he impossible to get the Treaty byagreement unless this particular point is conceded..    If the^gypimans were given the appearance of controlling their ownforeign affairs they would not bother about the substance,and the terms of the proposed Treaty absolutely precludedtheir having any foreign policy independent of Great Britain.If these terras were not sufficiently explicit, they could be strengthened in the drafting of the actual Treaty.    To this,he believed, the Egyptians would not obiect.It was urged, on the other hand, that if the Egyptianswere granted the machinery for conducting foreign policy they would use it to our detriment, and in any case they wouldnot long be content with the mere shadow of control.Lord Milner called attention to the importance ofprompt act-on.    wgypt was now politically very tranquil, butthis was due to the fact that the people were daily expectingthe Report, which they believed would be favourable to Egypt-ian aspirations.    If nothing was said or done soon, he fearedthere would be a reaction and that the old agitation wouldrevive and might again take violent forms.After a review of the various considerations,  theCabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should inform the High Comrcis-sioner in Cairo that His Ma^es-ty&apos;s Gcv-ernment had recei-ved the Report o^ theSpecial mission and were in process of
considering it., but that before tailingany decision they desired to discuss thematter with the  Egyptian Government,which should accordingly be invited tosend an official Delegation to london for this discussion in the early partof the year:(b) That the Secretary of 3* ate for foreign^airs should forward a copy of theReport to Lord Allenby, and invite hisopinion upon it..   Ee should make itclear, however,, that His Majesty&apos; sGovernment were not cor. mitted in anyway to the acceptance of the Report inprinciple:(c) That the Report should be laid beforeboth Houses at the opening of Parlia-ment, and should be communicated atthe same time to the Egyptian Delega-tion before their departure fro   egypt.whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,January 5,  1921.
