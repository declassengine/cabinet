(1) -Vith TBfBrenco to ..-,birwt-04.....Oonalualon- V-the-..Chairman of the Home Affairs Committee (Mr H.A,L. Fisher)reported that, in accordance with the decision of the Cabinet,the Committee, assisted by the Chief Secretary for Irelandand the Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty, had confer-red with General Macready, General Tudor and Sir John Andersonin regard to the . tree-table of proceedings for the firstelections and first meetings of the Parliaments of southern and Northern Ireland.Cwing to the necessity of taking advantage of themeeting of the Privy Council on March 24th, the Prime Minister,after consultation with the Chairman of the Home Affairs Com-mittee and fb&quot; Chief Secretary for Ireland, had already taken.a provisional decision.The Cabinet took note of and confirmed theprovisional decision of the Prime Minister,in consultation w1th the Chief Secretary,that an Order in Council should be issued on March 24, 1921,  fixing April 19th forthe Appointed Day, and May 4th for summon-ing Parliament   both in the North and Southof Ireland.The Cabinet then discussed the desirabilityof announcing a truce to take effect duringthe period of the elections,andthe offer of a truce for negotiationsbefore the election,and agreed  To consider both questions again after theFaster adjournment.(2) The Cabinet considered a recommendation of the HomeAffairs Committee, with whom, had been associated the chief secretary for Ireland and the parliamentary 17 Secretary to theAdmiralty, in favour of giving General Macready discretion tc.use armed aeroplanes for operations in Ireland against SinnFein.Considerable stress was 1&apos;aid on the great risk of death and injury to innocent people, owing to the extreme(a)(b)
difficulty of diet Ir. pi lacing innocent from guilty^Tr^^-^in&apos;aeroplane sumnonod possibly from a distance by telephone,and necessarily proceeding at high speed and operating at aconsiderable height. ,On the. other, hand, General Macready had shown theHome Affairs Committee that he was fully alive to the risks and hie personal responsibility in the matter, and had &quot;strongly urged the importance of his receiving discretion to&apos; arm the aeroplanes.    At present aeroplanes were dis-regarded owing to the fact that they were known to beunarmed.The Cabinet were informed that the experience in the-Punjab had been that it was impossible, once an aeroplanewas sent out, to safeguard against an untoward incident.The Cabinet agreed(a) That General Macready should be givendiscretion to employ armed aeroplanesin Ireland under very special regula-tions to be issued by the General,, butonly after their approval by the PrimeMinister, who should,- if he thought ad-visable, bring them before the Cabinet:(b) That the Secretary of. State for War should invite General Macready, in preparing hisdraft regulations,  to consider the expedi-ency of including regulations to the effectthat, while all aeroplanes would be&apos;armed,they should never, use their arma while inthe air except whenacmtng in conjunctionwith troops on the ground,

(9) The Cabinet had before them&apos; a Jtfemaxwidruiuby-theFirst Commissioner of torke (Paper C.P.-2643) in which theCabinet were informed that a site in St. James&apos;s Park,opposite the Horse (hoards&apos;  Parade, on which it had been intended, to place a statue of LordKitchener, had new been allocated to a proposed Memorial to the Guards&apos; Division.This had been announced in the House of Commons by theFirst Commissioner of Works, who had promised to exhibitdrawings showing certain consequential alterations of theroadways in the Park.    Sir Alfred Mond proposed that these-...^alterations, (which were explained to the Cabinet by meansof drawings) should be carried out as part of a scheme for.the relief ef unemployment.In the course of the discussion it was pointed outthat strong objection would probably be taken in the Houseof Commons to the course now proposed, that the general public were very jealous for the undisturbed preservation of the Parks,  and that an increase in the number of statues.in and around the Park was to be resented on aestheticgrounds.    It was generally felt that there would be less objection to the alteration of the roadways if it wouldresult in an increase of grassland.The Cabinet agreed to adjourn theconsideration of the subject.

THE MINISTER 0F TRANSPORT in the absence of the Attorney General, summarised the opinion of the Law officers, obtained in accordance with the decision of the Committee at its previous meeting, and stated the action which, in pursuance of the opinion, he had already taken or proposed to take, on the various conclusions and recommendations set out on pages 33 and 34 of the Colwyn Committee&apos;s Report. The statement in question may be briefly summarised as follows:-

CONCLUSIONS 1 to 4

The Law Officers are of opinion that the Agreement is exhaustive of the Government&apos;s liability under the Regulation of the Forces Act, 1871, and that the Companies will be unable to maintain claims for compensation under that Act beyohd what is provided for under the Agreement.

They are further of opinion that the Companies cannot support claims, under the Ministry of Transport Act, 1919, to compensation for alleged reduction in revenue earning capacity, except that insofar as any such reduction 13 due to acts of the Minister, and Sir Eric Geddes said ? was clear that the balance was not against him under this head.

As claims under these heads have not yet been formulated by the Companies, no immediate action on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government is called for.



RECOMMENDATION 1: EXCESS MAINTENANCE.

The Law Officers have advised that the Minister of Transport is entitled in law to disallow maintenance charges in excess of the 1913 standard unless such charges can be justified as being due to abnormal circumstances, and that be is legally entitled to make deductions from monthly claims and to disallow future claims until the excesses are adjusted or justified.

In this connection the Minister of Transport is advised that he cannot legally demand a cash refund until the final settlement with the Companies at the end of the period of control.
IRSCOMMBUDATIONS:    ARREARSf MAINTENANCE *,URRENT PAY4-BHIS ON ACCOUNT.e.c. OMMENDATI ON 3tIRRBARS OF MAIN-IS NANCE : ADDIT-ONAL COST OFRREARS MADE GOODDURING THE PERIODF. CONTROL.The Minister oi^Trajisport has already informed:.-,the Companies that in future charges for excessmaintenance will be (disallowed until justified,and that excesses on one Abstract will be set against deficiencies, on another^   insofar as this,action doee not suffice to effect  the.necessary adjustments, the Minister of Transport; proposes tomake deductions from the Companies&apos; monthly claims.The Law Officers advise that it is clearly,open to the Government as a matter of law. to&apos;carry out the recommendation of the Colwyr Comm-ittee that such payments should be discontinued..The Minister of Transport accordingly proposesto discontinue payments on aocount of arrears.The Colwyn Committee recommended that theCompanies should utilise funds already paid tothem (amounting now to approximately  42,000,000)before receiving further payments through the monthly claims on account of the additional costof arrears of work overtaken.toThe Minister of Transport accordingly proposesact on the advice of the Colwyn Committee andto make no further payments to any Company onaccount of the additional cost, of arrears over-taken until the funds already accumulated by that company have been disbursed.SO ommend at ION 4.SEARS OF MAINTEN-.:CE OUTSTANDING1.5 THE END OF THESRIOD OF CONTROL.iThe Law Officers advise that the &quot;agreement&quot;whioh the Colwyn Committee regard as inequitableis not a legally bind.ir.g Agreement but is amutebCe arrangement, and that it is open toHis Majesty1 s Government to endeavour tenegotiate a settlement on the lines of theColwyn Committee*s Report.-2-
RSCOMMSNDATION 5. The law Officers&apos; Opinion endorses generally the recommendation of the Colwyn Committee. NoABNORMAL *i3AR AND claims in respect of abnormal wear end tear haveTEAR. been allowed,With the exception of one admittedspecially in 1916.RECOMMENDATION 6. The law Officers are reconsidering theirOpinion, and nothing arises at the moment.      TheINTEREST ON CAPITA!   matter is relatively unimnortant.EXPENDITURE.RECOMMENDATION 7. The Law Officers advise that it is notpossible, as a matter of law, to set aside the replacement CF agreement as to replacement of stores, but thatSTORES. the circumstances surrounding this agreement mayafford a justification for its statutory modifi-cation.The Minister of Transport stated that he had had indications from the Companies that they willnot press their claims tinder this agreement.THE MINISTER OF TRANSPORT stated that he was anxious oto have confirmation from the Cabinet of the action which-&apos;he had already taken,  and approval of the action he pro-posed to take.     He anticipated that as a result of that action the Government would be attacked by the railwayinterests, who would represent themselves as being sub-jected to harsh treatment,  in which circumstances itwas necessary that he should have the Cabinet1s unquali-fied support.      The Committee and the Cabinet could rely upon him to proceed as carefully as possible in orderhot to place the Companies in an unreasonably difficult position.      The Minister of Transport pointed out thatsome  170,000,000 to  200,000,000 was involved in thisquestion, and stated that he was sanguine that, havingestablished the position of the Government by the actionwhich he proposed, he would be able to negotiate an egresdsettlement with the Companies, as a result of which the
amount ulAlma^tely&quot; paid.- -ter the f^ompajoia-a would, be- wry ouchreduced.      In ordex&quot; to negotiate such a settl^meiib- h a c -cee^,however,fully,/it would be necessary for him to make certain con-cessions to the Companies; the nature of whixih..he--wwuljd -pa-^o-pose to communicate to the Cabinet verhallly.The Committee agreed -To recommend t&apos;6 the Cabinet that theMinister of T^auiHpumt he authorisedto take action on the lines proposedby him.Whitehall Gardens, S.W01.March 15th. 1981..

TI^^R^OTOY)    U) ^ Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Confer-B1^L- enoe that there were three big questions of principle arisingTime, Table for out of the amendments to the German Reparation (ReVcvery)thft &quot;Pill. vBill on which a decision was required, and a decision wasalso needed on the question of the time to be allotted tothe Bill in the House of Oormons.   As regards the questionof time, he felt that it would, not be possible to take allthe remaining stages of the Pill in the House of Commonstoday.    There had been considerable opposition to the pro-posal to rush the Bill through the House before Easter.Lord Edmund Talbot said that he had pointed out thatthe Bill must either be taken forthwith or Members must beprepared to give up the Easter holiday.    There was a growingfeeling throughout the House that the holiday should not be sacrificed.The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested that it mightbe possible to take the Committee stage of the Bill today, onthe understanding that^the Report stage and Third Readingwere disposed of on Friday.    This would enable the holidayarrangements to be maintained.    If, however,  the House ofCommons insisted on a trore prolonged discussion, it should beinformed that, this could only be given by sacrificing the holiday,Lord Edmund Talbot remarked that it would not be pos-sibl&apos;-: to give the whole of Friday to this Bill, as the Hou3ehad been promised a discussion on that day on the CivilService War Bonus Estimates.    It would also be necessary tomake arrangements with a view to the House of&apos;1 Lords giving a first Reading to the Bill on Friday, so that it might pass through its remaining stages in the House of Lords on Monday,Tuesday or Wednesday of next week.The Conference agreed  That Sir Donald Maclean should he invitedto ask the Prime Minister today, whether itwas the intention of the Government to pass the Bill through all its stages forthwith,and that in reply the Prime Minister should indicate the willingness of the Government
Contracts,having standing contracts entered into before March 8, 1921,to take their case before a Board of Trade Committee with aview to getting seme relief.    As a result orF enquiries madeby the Board of Trade it was clear that practically all such contracts would in fact be taken before the Committeesunless a time concession ccuDd be made     In the result, theto give as much time for discussion aspossible, on the understanding that the Committee stage would be completed today and the Report and Third Reading stageson Friday next.     The Prime Minister might take the opportunity of emphasizing thegreat importance, from the point of viewof the national interest, of imposing thissanction on Germany with the least possible delay, and the danger of postponing the putting into operation of the provisionsof the Bill.    If the House of Commons wasnot prepared to support the Government in enforcing the sanction,  the Government mu3tconsider the question of withdrawing theBill, as th^y could be no party to a sham.Date from which The Chancellor o  the Exchequer informed the ConferenceDill will oper-ate. that, as drafted, the Bill caxre into operation as from thedate of its passing into law,the date on which public notice of the intention of the Government topass this legislation was given.    In the interest of the Bili..itself, as well as in the interest of&apos; good -admirrisdsraivi^rr, itwas desirable to insert a fixed date.    Apart from other considerations, the Board of Trade would have to set upCommittees to work the Act, and these Committees could notbe established in the few days available before the passingof the Act.    Unless, therefore, some concession was made,; great trouble and confusion would result immediately on theRoyal Assent being given to the Bill.   He therefore suggestedthat the Bill should be amended so as to make it-operate asfrom March SI, 1921.The Conference agreed --To accept the suggestion of the Chan-cellor of the Exchequer.Concession The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Confer-as regardsStanding       ence that under the Bill, as drafted, it was open to persons
Committees would be overwhelmed with applieationsnmd ^rouldhave to adopt some rough and ready method of-dealing withthe problem.    He accordingly suggested that in the case ofthese standing contracts entered into before March 8th, aperiod of one month should be granted in order that thegoods might be cleared.    The effect of this would be thatnonpayments would be made to the Exchequer in respect of such contracts before, say. May 1, 1921.In support of this proposal it was pointed out thatin the absence of any concession a very heavy penalty wouldbe imposed by the Bill on British nationals, particularly inthose cases, which were very numerous, where payments hadbeen made in advance.    In any event the pressure on the trading community would be severe, owing to the loss of future German orders and the fact that London would probablycease to finance the trade.    The inconvenience to &quot;the Britishtraders would be greatly increased if the Allied Governmentsdid not immediately pass legislation Similar to this Bill.The demand for some concession would come not only from theHouse Of Commons but from the whole trading community, andit was very desirable, in the&quot; interests of a possible future settlement with Germany, that the Government should have the trading community 6n their side in carrying out this particu-lar method of getting money for reparation.On the other hand, it was pointed Ojit by the PrimeMinister that this particular measure was needed as a sanctionand that it was most material to impose the sanction on germany with as little delay as possible, so as to exert themaximum pressure on Germany at the critical moment, which,in hi3 view, was the present moment.    He felt some doubt whether, in fact, the immediate enforcement of the sanctionimposed a very heavy penalty on British traders, and evenif it did put certain of those traders to some inconvenienceit must be remembered that the interests affected were engaged in importing cheap&apos;German goods into this country,
find it necessary to do so, an theunderstanding that he would*r6T5&quot;tain somecompensating concession in return fromthe opposition.mdeavourAllocation^ The Chancellor of the Exchequer reminded the Confer-of Receipt-pence that he had originally proposed, at the Inter-Allied(Conference,  that each Allied Government adopting this scheme should retain its own receipts for reparation, and only paythe surplus into a general pool.    This proposal had, however,been resisted by the French and Belgian d legates, who had insisted on all the money collected being pooled for thebenefit of all Powers interested in reparation.    An amendment&apos;had now been moved, the effect of which would be to restore the original-British proposal., &apos; -4-possibly to t^ie-^etrimeiTt-o^ Brrtish m^rrurfWtnrrcrs andBritish labour.    Personally he did not see any inconreni-ence In compelling persons to buy in Great Britain insteadaf in Germany.    The cases of traders who had made payments in advance could, no doubt, be specially treated.    The factthat this was a sanction imposed on Germany was bound to leadto an outcry, and precisely the same elements which had ep-posed the Dyestuffs Bill and the Safeguarding of IndustriesBill would oppose this Bill, and for similar reasons.    he doubted whether these elements would agree to any compromise,anal in any case he was most reluctant to have to adept apolicy the effect of which would be to postpone the opera-tion o^ tho sanction for at least six weeks.
