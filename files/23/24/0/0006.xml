With reference to Cabinet 75 (20), Appendix I (6),OF SCOTLAND BILL.sore discussion took place on the proposed Bill for theunion of the Churches in Scotland.    It was explained that
the proposals would he very strongly pressed by the repre-esntativea of the Scottish Churches,The Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary for Scotland,  togetherwith the Scottish members of the Cabinet,should 6 are fully examine the proposals inthe Bill in the light of public opinion inScotland, and advise the Cabinet thereon. LICENSING BILL.    (4) During the course of the discussion on future Parlia-mentary business,  reference was made to the possibility ofobtaining agreed proposals on a Licencing Bill.    It was stated that the Attorney-General had been devoting special attention to the matter.The Cabinet agreed  That the further consideration of thematter should be postponed until the attorney-General could be present.UNEMPLOYMENT.        (5)  The Minister of Labour drew the attention of theCabinet to the grave situation which would arise In regardto unemployment early in March, when Unemployment Insuranceor Out-of-work Donation^at present being drawn by upwards ofa million people,would run out and charitable contributions would be the sole means of support.    The Labour Party wouldcertainly press the matter during the Debate on the Address,and it was therefore necessary to take immediate action inorder to avoid the semblance of taking, under pressure, steps which would have to be tak-n in any event.    In order tosafeguard the country it was essential that a promise shouldbe given in the King&apos;s Speech to do everything that was pos-sible.    Proposals were under consideration in the Ministryof Labour which would shortly be submitted to the Chancellorof the Exchequer.    Broadly speaking, these proposals were, -to extend the period of Unemployment Insurance to 15 weeks ata uniform late of  1, provision being made to bring ex-Servieemen within the Unemployment Insurance Act.    It was proposedto draw upon the apsumulatiDiiS of the Unemployment Fund to finance the proposals.    The Exchequer would be called upon
to make a contingent provision lip to  5,000,000.    In viewof the fact that Trade Union benefits had been practicallyexhausted, the 15/- which in the first instance had merelybeen an addition to other means of support was now the onlyavailable source of maintenance^  and on this ground it was proposed to raise it to  1.It was pointed out, on the&apos; other hand,  that theunemployed were being better treated under the present ar-rangements than ever befor-&quot;.    It was tru-* that the rate hadformerly been 7/- a week in 1914, which was worth slighty more than 15/- today, but, on the other hand, it had applied only to a -fraction of industry-The Cabinet agreed  That the proposals of the Minister ofLabour, after having been submitted tothe Treasury, should be referred to theCabinet Committee on Unemployment forthe consideration of details, and thatimmediately thereafter they should beconsidered by the Cabin-t in the courseof th^ present week.(6) With reference to Conclusion 2 of the AppendixL-attached hereto, the Cabin-t had under consideration theReport of the Cabinet Committee on the Employment of ex-Servioe a en in Housing  (Paper CP.-2530), together with thefollowing, Papers:-Memorandum by tho Minister of Health(Pso-r CP.-2532) ,.Tele.crams exchanged between Sir LionelEarle and Sir Alfr d Mond (Paper C.P.-2531) ,Note by the Minister of Labour, coveringReply of Building Trade Unions (paper cp.-2536) .The Secretary &quot;ror Scotland explained that, the Build-ing Trade Unions having reject--ml the proposals of the Govern-ment for the absorption of 50,000 ex-Service men in the skilled crafts of the building trade, the situationenvisaged in the Report, of the Committee had arisen.    TheCabinet were recommended to obtain, if possible, the cons on-&apos;
of the Local Authorities and the Building P..plovers to takea definite T^rc^nt&amp;cre of unemployed ex-Service men onskilled work in the Housing Schemes at present being carriedout.    It  -as accordingly proposed to issue an appeal toLocal Authorities, to publish a precis in the Press of thenegotiations between the Government and tho Tirade Unionsextending over a period of more than two years,  and to ar-range *or a Con-fer&apos;-nce between the Cabinet Committee andthe Master Builderc,    It was further proposed that a SpecialOfficial should be appointed -&quot;ho should be charged with theoversight of the employment of ex-Service men in housing,and that any additional cost involved by reason of the em-ployment of these men should be borne on a special Vote bythe T&apos;&apos;i^isfry or Labour.    In the event of the r-refusal of theLocal Authorities and the Building Employers to co-operate,the Committee had considered various alternative proposals,the cumulative effect of which it was hoped would be tosecure the employment of 50,000 ex-Service men on skilledvork in Housing:-(1) By concentrating on n^w methods of con-struction which would largely eliminate,the employment of bricklayers:(ii) By offering a subsidy of  100 per house to Public ^orks Contractors) Public UtilityCompanies aed private builders, on condi-tion that a fixed proportion of ex-Servicemen were put on the work:(iii) By the employment of ex-Service men inTJrousir.  Schemes under th&quot; control of theO^ic&quot; of Works or the Scottish Board ofHealth on behal* of Local Authorities:(iv) By authorising the Office of works toundertake direct house-building on behalfof the Ministry of Health.The Committee were not sanguine as to the possibility ofcarrying out the third and fourth proposals, and in thelatter o-&quot;&quot; these complicated legislation would be required.It &quot;-as further proposed that it should be enacted that any local Authority failing to co ply with the Government&apos;3proposals for the employment of ex-Service men should bedeemed to be in dt-ault. with the result that their housing
scheme would, be caieried..throu^at their expense.The Cabinet w re generally agreed that it was impessi-ble to decide on the next step to be taken until the attitudeof the employers was definitely ascertained.    The latter were believed to be willing to bring matters to a head only on an issue for increasing the standard of production by a systemof bonus on output, or other similar means.It was explained that at a meeting between the Ministryof Labour and the Employers on the preceding Friday it had beenmade clear to the latter that the Government could not agreeto insist upon a system of bonus on output, on the groundthat to do so would raise an acute controversy not merelywith the Building Trade but with the whole Trade Union move-ment;    but the Master Builders had not given any definitereply as to the attitude they would adopt should the Govern-ment refuse to fight on that issue and limit their demands tothe employment of ex-Service men.On the other hand, there was an impression that, owingto the demand for buildings for trade purposes having fallenoff, the Building employers were inclined to be less independ-ent than formerly, and if an appeal were made to them therewas a possibility that they would agree to support the Gov-ernment, though on the whole it was probable that they werenot yet ready for action.    At the sace time, Local authorities were becoming less inclined to refuse co-operation.    the pressure of public opinion had not been without its affect.The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to the neces-sity of avoiding any action which would cut across the pro-posal fo^ setting some kind of limit to the liability ofthe Government in respect of Housing, and it was suggestedthat any further subsidies should be restricted to induce-ments to private buildors to core in rather than further financial assistance to Local Authorities.
It was suggested that the Government should not be too ready to accept the refusal of the Local Authorities toco-operate, and that they should make it a condition ofsubsidising the houses built by Local Authorities that ex-Service men should be employed, but this could not be done without legislation.The Cabinet agreed -That a Conference should be held, with notmore than six rtpresentatives of the Build-ing Employers&apos;  federation, to be attended by -The Prime Minister,Mr Bonar Law,Mr ChamberlainMr Munro,Dr Addison,Dr Macnamara,at 4-30 p.m, on the following Wednesday,February 9, 1931.(7) The Cabinet had undr consideration a Report by theUnemployment Committee of the Cabinet (Paper C,P.-2517) onthe slow progress of the Arterial Roads Schemes for therelief of Unemployment in Greater London, from, which itappeared that some 774 men only were errployed as against11,700, the number which should have been at work, at thepresent time.    It appeared that the co-operation of certainCounty Councils had not been forthcoming, for various m-asomparticularly the following:-(i) Th&apos;ir cor n-itments in connection with roadschnces in oth r parts o&quot;&quot; their Counties:(ii) That the schemes would not be of assistanceto unemployed in ttmir counties, but are r -quired for the unemployed resident in the metropolis:(iii) Their heavy financial obligations.The Committee recommended:-That the scope o&quot; reference to the Unermploy-ment Grants Committee (Lord St, Davids&apos;Corn ittee), be enlarged so as to authorisethem in their discretion to max- a grant ofthe whole or part of the 50 per cent, contri-bution which would normally be payable by aLocal Authority in respect of any arterialroad scheme in Greater London, such scheme tobe submitted by the Ministry of Labour and ministry of Transport jointly - Subject always to the Unemployment Grants Committee being
satisfied,in respect of any particular achemesubmitted to them,that the following condi-tiens prevail     ;..(1) &quot;That tve.Local Authority has refused&apos; to. co-operate either on the ground thatthe scheme will only assist the uneo*rployed in the Metropolis and not those ....in its&apos;are a - or that it has already: incurred heavy obligations in respect .-&apos;&quot;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos; a&apos;&quot;     of. arterial roads:and(2)  That there is serious-unemployr^ht either-    in the district in which the proposedarterial road will be made-or.in-a dis-trict near,enough to supply the labour, . - required.&apos;     1Lord St. Davids stated that, on the figures given by theMinistry of Transport, if the whole of the.. 9 or 11 schemesfor arterial rpada in London which-had hot been undertakenwere put in.&apos;hand and the whole&apos;balance of the coat granted,they would absorb almost  2,000,000 out of the  3,000,000 athis disposal&apos;    but, on.the other hand, in view of the small amount of the applications which his Committee ware receivingfrom Local Authorities, it Wa&apos;a&apos; &apos;improbable that the money would otherwise be. allocated in the course of the next threemonths.    It was important, i*&quot; the&apos;Cabinet concurred in therecommendations of the Unemployment Committee, that the deci-sion should not be published, lest the power of negotiating with Loc al&apos;Authorities-should &quot;thereby be thrown away.The Cabinet approved the recommendationsof the Cabinet Committee on Unemploymentset out above;, but &apos;agreed --(a) That &quot;the schemes to&apos; be submitted forgrant8 from Lord Sti Davids* ;.Cor ittee ,.should be-put fbrwdrdmby the&apos;Ministryof Labour alone, and not by the Ministry . -..... of Labour and the Ministry of Transport;   jointly:(b) That care should be taken to avoid thepublication of this decision.. ....: .OF       (6) The Cabinet took note of the Conclusions 0f the. following Conference of Ministers, held on January 25,. 1921, at -3-30 p,m.:-(1) Unemploymont -grant a ,(2) Ex-Service men and Housing Operations,Gardens,  S..&apos;,.l, (Appendix.),ry 7, 1921. .....-7- &apos;

Vler^employment &apos; With reference to. Conference - of Ministers heldjcoricl,. 1) v.       January -24th, 1921, the Conference had before then the copy of a letter from., the Chairman of the unemployment grants-Committee to the Prime Minister (C.P.2485) inwhich- he asked -(a) That the&apos;powers of the Committee to feel&apos; with roads which were not within the Ministryof Transport?s Scheme for construction andmaintenance grants:,  should not be limited to cases where the expenditure on labour was notloss than 50f of the total expenditure; and(b) that advances towards the cost of labour inschemes put forward by the Local Authoritiesshould no longer be limited to fOO but should be extended to 60/ at once.eith regard, to (a) Lord. St, ^avids stated that he was informed by the Ministry of Transport that except incoses of new roads or road-mic In which there was agreat deal of excavation to be- done,,  the labour cost would seldom approximate to 50% of the work, and there- -fore the extension of the powers of.the Committee which .was recently granted would only increase to a very limited extent the Cormeittee!s capacity for promoting employment.With regard to (b) the position on the 20thJanuary ess that the total grants promised to cover workup to eOth April, 1921&apos;, only amounted to  72,760 and  itwas probable that it wouide be difficult to make largegrants quickly &quot;put of the  3,000,000 authorised by theCabinet unless nearly all the money required by the LocalAuthorities mas provided for them.      To all intents- endpurposes the present scheme of grants had broken down. .-The Conference was reminded, by ft he Chancellor - of-the Exchequer of the position at the&apos;&quot;time ehen theCabinet made the grant of  3,.000,.000.      The Cabinetthen,,was anxious to husband- its resourcesy but now as there appeared..little danger of the  .%000,000 limit beingexceeded, there could.be little objection to falling in with the suggestion made by Lord StB.Davids.Tee/
The Chancellor of the Exchequer, however, attached, greatImportance to obtaining as large a local contribution aspossibles     Unemployment had always been regarded as a localproblem - the central Government co:rflning itself to supplementinglocal effort.     He was anxious that local bodies should notbe encouraged to abandon this responsibility.Lord St. Davids stated that in connection with his request for power to grant 60fo of the Wages Bill of additional mentaken for work, there was one minor point which he would liketo raises     At present the Committee could only make grants to assist Local Authorities in carrying out schemes, a phrasewhich rendered it doubtful whether the Committee could make agrant to a Local Authority for the purpose of enabling itto assist a scheme to be carried out, e.g, by a DistressCommittee or by Voluntary Agency0     He suggested the committee might be empowered to make grants in such cases providedthat the Local Authorities definitely recommended thescheme and made themselves respdns Ibis, for the Committee1 sconditions and provided also that no grant was ma.de in respectof any scheme of which.the proceeds (if any) would go to private per^sons or commercial companies *The Conference agreed:-(a) that the power of the Unemployment Grants Committeeto deal with roads which were not within the Ministryof Transport&apos;a scheme for censtruction or maintenancegrants, should not be limited to cases where theexpenditure on Labour was not less than 50&apos;? of thetotal expenditure *(b) that grants towards the cost of labour in schemesput forward by the Local Authorities should beextended from &apos;50% to 60&apos;6,fe) that the powers of the Committee to make grants toLocal Authorities should be extended to include agrant to a Local Authority to enable it to assista Distress Committee or Voluntary Agency in carryingout a scheme provided that the scheme was recommended&apos;-definitely by the Local Authority, and. that thelatter made Itself responsible that tho conditions laid down by the Unemployment Grants Committee were observed,-
C-SSteVICE ME1T fith reference- to Cabinet S3 (20),  Conclusion 6,ID r/^U3I]JGdrRATTOffS. the conference? had before them a Memorandum by theconclusion 2) ,Minister of Labour (C.P.246B)  In which he raised thequestion of the redemption of the Government under-taking that 50, 000 ox-service men should be employedon Housing operations.The Minister of Labour informed the conference that the answer of the building trade operatives to theGovernment request for their assistance in the matter,would not be received until after 3rd February,    but that so far as present indications went they were likely torefuse their co-operation-    The Minister of Labour there-fore suggested inter alia the following measures:-(a) That as there were enough sites now ready for building operations to take 50,000ex-service men,  the Local Authoritiesshould be asked if they would take onex-service men for these sites.(b.) That as the City of London was preparedto proceed with ex-service men -on the site now in its possession it should beinvited to make the preliminary prepara-tions for emp 1 oying ex- service men onthi s site,The Minister of Labour- held the view that if (b)above was set in operati on&apos; other L peal Author! ties would. be compelled by public opinion to follow suit, Afterthe 3rd February it would be,necessary to get the ex-service men together and train them if the promise ofthe government was to be redeemed.The opinion was expressed that action,   such as hadbeen indicated, by the city Of- London would be followedby other Local Authorities - though the /
&quot;^weaknes-a cf &apos;^1i-e---sxig^e^-i^oi&apos;i -of the..k!lnLsmer of ijaDoivrthewas that it did not bring in/e?nployers.    rmrpioyers wouldhe shy of falling in with the suggested sti on on account ofthe fear that if they undertook such housing work their employees would strike on their other huiicing contracts.It was suggested that between now end the 3rd february the building Employers Federation should be consulted as local Authorities would be quite helpless &quot;without their assistance.    The Ministry of Health estimated that 58^of the housing scheme a &quot;of Local Authorities were in factbeing executed by private contractors.It was also stated that a number of local authorities would like to take the line suggested by the Minister ofrpabour,  if the-/ dared.The Conference generally thought that before coming to a decision on the question raised by the Minister ofLabour.,  it was necessary to be further informed as to how far the Government was likely to succeed in itsendeavour to en-ploy 5o,OOC ex-service men on buildingoperations,  without the assistance of the Building TradeOpera.-mi ves.Th a Conference agr eed:-(1) To appoint the following Committee --Secretary for Scotland (Chairman)Minister of Labour.Minister of Health.Sir p.
