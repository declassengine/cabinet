Notwithstanding the Admiraltyrepresentations,  the British Government had really no alter-native but to ratify the Protocol,.    The efforts of theBritish Representatives at the Assembly of the League ofNations to secure that the decisions of the Court, whenestablished, should not be treated as precedents to be used against Great Britain, had been successful, and it wasespecially to be observed that the British representative had not signed the special Clause which made the jurlsdic-tion of the Court compulsory In the case of States whichaccepted that Clause,After the Cabinet had been informed by the Lord Ghan-cellor that&quot;he saw no objection or danger to Great britain in the establishment of the Permanent Court of InternationalJustice on the lines contemplated in the Protocol, it wasagreed --That the necessary steps, should be taken to ratify the Protocol establishing the Perrcan-ent Court of International Justice in thef^rm attached to Paper CP.-2543.
^SgQMINO (2) The Cabinet had ..under consideration a Memorandum byf&apos;j&apos;^f &amp; tKe WordProsident of the Council  (Paper 0*1,-2567)  coveringp NATIONS.     &quot;the- recommendations of an Interdepartmental Conference held for the purpose of -considering.. inter alia,  the action to be taken  on certain Resolutions recently passed by tho Assemblyof the League of Nations,.Smmission       (a)       The Cabinet were informed that the Council of theReduction .Armaments. League, in pursuance of a Resolution passed by the Assembly,would have to set up a temporary Commission, composed ofpersons possessing the requisite competence in matters of apolitical, 3ocial and economic nature, to prepare for theCouncil in the near future reports and proposals for thereduction of armaments, and that it would be necessary forthe british Government to nominate a representative, who should be some person in touch with the Cabinet and shouldbe of sufficient distinction and prestige to balance li-Viviaji:the nominee of the French Government, who aspired to be theChairman of the Commission.   The main duty of the commission would be to examine the best plan for effecting a reductiono^ armaments on the basis of expenditure, and ae this wouldInvolve the difficult task rf comparing the War Budgets ofdifferent countries it might be desirable that the british representative should have special financial qualifications,In any case,  the Representative should be a civilian andshould view the problem from the civilian  and politicalpoints of view rather than from the. military aspect.Some discussion took place as to the practicability of conducting any really satisfactory enquiry.on the lines proposed, and the Cabinet were informed that the commission would have to take all material considerations into account,such, for example, ae the nature of the financial liabilitiesincurred by countries which maintained conscript and vclun-tary armies respectively, or countries which had no oversearesponsibilities, and those   like the British Empire^ whosenaval expenditure must be largely determined by her-2-
world-wide geographical distribution.   While the planfavoured by the Assembly was not free from objection,  itwas less open to criticism than the scheme contemplated inthe Covenant, which involved the submission by each country of particulars of its military and naval expenditure, whichparticulars were to be examined by a Military commission which would advise what armaments should be regarded as adequate in each particular case.It was pointed out that,.before the British Hepre-sentative could take any decision on this Commission, itwould be necessary for the experts to prepare the material,and that in the nature of the question such preparationsmust take a considerable time.The Cabinet agreedThat Mr H.A.L. Pisher should be nominated asthe British Representative on the Commissionon the Reduction of Armaments.WOTg:    ^h the course of the foregoingdiscussion the question was raided ofthe exact relationship of the british representative on the Council of theLeague  go the Cabinet .t end it was gen-&quot;orally agreed that oho only way inwhich the British Representative couldrepresent the views ot Greet britain was by his representing the views ofthe British Government  for hue timebeing, and that it was clearly under-stood that before the British be present-ative book any decision of importoncehe would obtain Cabinet approval for his action * -[raffle inOpiumsolution.(b)     The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theColonial Office on the question of the Opium Traffic inthe Eastern Colonies  (Paper 0.P.-0554), and were informedthat if the expression &quot;suppression of the traffic&quot; couldbe interpreted as &quot;gradual suppression of the traffic&quot; thedifficulties foreshadowed by the Colonial Office would beto a considerable extent removed.The Cabinet took note of thiscons consideration.
Mandates&apos;CoramiauLeim,.The OaJlriaet-^er-e Informed that it would be necessaryto- appoint a British Representative on the Mandates Comrcis-sionIt was agreed  That the Secretary of State for theColonies should nominate a suit?hieperson to act as the British Re ore-sent at ive on this Commission, afterobtaining the Prime Minister1s ap-proval of the person selected.CommitteeBlockade.onam a teai       The Secretary of State for War informed the Cabinetthat It would be very difficult for him to spare time to actas the British Representative on the Blockade Committee, andhe emphasized the great importance of impressing upon who-ever might represent Great Britain on this Committee thenecessity of not disclosing the secret arrangements for theeconomic blockade enforced in this country during the War.The Cabinet agreed  That the President of the Board of Trade,after consultation with the First Lordof the Admiralty and the Secretary/ ofState for War, should nominate theBritish Representative on the BlockadeCommittee,(e * The Cabinet were informed that it was desirable, ifpossible,  to persuade the Council of the league to defer theconsideration of the &quot;A&quot; Mandates for Palestine, mesopotamia and Syria until the next meeting of the Council.    By so doing the Secretary of State for the Colonies would have an oppor-tunity of considering the terms of these Mandates at his forthcoming meeting in Egypt with Sir Percy Cox and SirHerbert Sanue 1.Tt was pointed out that the French Government was most anxious to get their Mandate for Syria approved by theCouncil, as it. was represented that until this approval hadbeen given it was not possible for the French to set gap&quot;thoir Civil Administration in Syria.The Cabinet agreed  That the British Representative should be requested to use his best endeavours to   ..persuade the Council to postpone the con-sidsration of the &quot;A&quot; Mandates until  thenext meeting of the Council in the Summer.,
AGENDA F&amp;R (3) With reference to Cabinet- 4 (21), Conclusion 4, theTHF IMPETUtAL--Oab1jnet.- had -under -consideration a Note by the Secretary of0ABX.,^,T IN1921. State for the Colonies covering the Report of the Inter-departmental Committee appointed to consider the Agenda andany advance arrangements for the forthcoming meeting of theImperial Cabinet (Paper CP.-2551) .rThe Cabinet agreed --(a) To accept the recommendations containedin the Report o^ the Committee:(b) To appoint the following Agenda Committeeto work nut details as to subjects,etc., for the different meetings:..The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,The Secretary of State for the Colonies,The Secretary of State for India,Lieut.-Oslonel L.C,M,S. Amery (Under-&apos;Secretary of State for the Colonies),Colonel S.H. Wilson, C3.,C.M.G.,(Secretary).EMPIRE! CURRENCY,   (4) In connection with the Agenda for the forthcoming meeting of the Imperial Cabinet, a suggestion was made thatit might be desirable for the British Government to place onthe Agenda the question of Empire Currency, In order thatthere might be a discussion as to the best means of remedyingthe present serious state of affairs which has involved apartialv  breakdown of credit as between different parts of the Empire.If some solution could be found,  trade would be encouragedand the rest of the world might be induced later to adopt asimilar system.    Special reference was made to the followingCabinet Papers on the subject, which had been waiting forconsideration for some considerable time-Memorandum, by Sir L. Worthing!on Evans,(Paper CP.-546) ,Joint Memorandum by Sir L. worthington evans and Lieut,-Colonel L.S. Amery(Paper CP,-ill?) ,Note by the Chancellor Of the Exchequer,covering Memorandum by Mr Blackett andMr Kawtrey (Paper Coin-1245),Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor India (Paper CP,-1357),
Memorandum by Sir L, Worthington Evans(Paper CP,-1509),Memorandum by the President of tie Boardof Trade (Paper CP.-1566).The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinetthat the proposals set out in the Memoranda by Sir L. Worth-inetou Evans were substantially those recommended by a certain-London banker, who had, however,  failed to secure Support forthese proposals either in the highest financial circles inLondon or in Canada,    It was most undesirable for the BritishGovernment to place an item of this-difficult, intricate andcontentious nature on the Agenda for the Imperial Cabinet,particularly when the Government had no concrete proposalto make.    He himself did not believe in the plan which-hadbeen devised for meeting these particular difficulties,  andhe certainly could not assume the responsibility of recom-mendlng the Imperial Cabinet to adopt that plan or any plan on similar lines.    The Colonial difficulties were largely dueto over-speculation, and he very much feared that any dlscus-8ion at the Imperial Cabinet would end in a demand by the. denies for financial assistance.    In particular,  thedifficulties cf the Australian Government were largely causedby the refusal of that Government to allow the Australianbanks to use their gold.    If any Dominion should spontaneous-ly place this question on the Agenda, clearly the BritishGovernment could not refuse to discuss it, but he woulddeprecate the British Government tasting the initiative inbriherinK the matter before the Imperial Cabinet.-The Secretary of State for War said he only wished the plan to be examined.    Ke himself had made no definiteproposition, but he felt convinced that the time mightshortly come when the different parts of the British Pmpirewould be quite unable to trade with one another.    Theserious thine was that, in spite of tho growing difficult-ties and financial stringency, no stops were being taken
In the course of the subsequent discussion it waspointed out that the plan referred to in the Memoranda wouldnot be accepted by Canada if it Involved divorcing her ex-change position from that of the United States and furtherdepreciating Canadian currency.    Further, any proposal which involved,, or might involve, Great Britain in stillheavier, financial obligations in the near future could not seriously be contemplated.It was then pointed out that it wauld be impossible to isolate the question of Exchange within the Empire from thatof Exchange outside the Empire, and that it was most desirablethat the British Government should encourage those enquiries into the world situation which had been initiated by theLeague of Nations through the Brussels Financial Conference.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the British Government shouldhot place the question of Imperial Exchange and Currencyon the Agenda of tho Imperial Cabinet:(b) That the Lord President of the Council, inconsultation with tho Chancellor of theExchequer, should draft the Terms of Rsfer-ence to an Expert Committee to consider thewhole question of the Imperial and foreign exchange a:(c) That when the Terms of Reference had beenagreed,  th- Chancellor of the exchequer should submit his proposals relative tothe enquiry to the Cabinet for furtheroona consideration.
JG-ENBlff SHIPS.    (5) With referar.ce to Cabinet 27 (20), Conclusion 6, theCabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Shipping Control-ler (Paper C.P,-2446)  covering an Agreement between GreatBritain and France with regard to the ultimate disposal of ex- enemy tonnage.Sir Joseph Maclay inferred the Cabinet that the Agree-ment had been signed by himself and M. Paul Bignon, and was subject to ratification by the British Government.The Cabinet agreed --To ratify the Agreement in question.
negotiations    the Cabinet were informed that the Master Builders werepith the Masterbuilders.. considering the reply to be given by then, to the offer ofthe Government, and it was suggested that,in the event of tlreply being, favourable, steps should be taken forthwith togive effect to the recommendations contained in the Reportof the Cabinet Committee (Paper C.P.25S0), which had dealtwith this aspect of the question.Th*a Cabinet agreed  To postpone further consideration of thematter until the reply of the MasterBuilders had actually bf&quot;en received.
ISNiPL  development (7) with reference to Cabinet 5 (Si), Conclusion ?,  theIIRELAND. ChiefCabinet were requested by the /Secretary for Ireland toconsider the advisability of allocating a definite propor-tion of the funds at the disposal of Lord St. Davids&apos; Corn-mi t tee to Ireland, it being pointed out that, owing to therecalcitrant and dilatory conduct of most of the Irish LocalAuthorities, very little money was being actually expendedin Ireland, while the position of the unemployed ex-Servicemen there was,   &apos;     even more desperate than in GreatBritain.    It was urged that some arrangement might be madeby which the Chief Secretary for Ireland might take the placeof Irish Local Authorities in applying for the Lord St. Davids&apos;Committee grants.The Cabinet agreed -That the Chief Secretary for Ireland andthe Minister of Labour should submit their proposals in writing to the Chancellor ofthe&quot;Exchequer, who undertook to give early consideration to those proposals.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,February 18, 1921.
