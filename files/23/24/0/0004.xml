FORTHCOMING INTER-ALLIED CONFERENCE IN? PARIS.

(1) With reference to Cabinet 2 (21), Conclusion 1 (b), the Cabinet discussed various-questions likely to be raised at the forthcoming Inter-Allied Conference in Paris.

It was agreed -

?) Composition of the British Delegation.

It was agreed -

That, in addition to the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Sir L.  Worthington Evans should be asked to attend in connection more particularly with the question of Reparation. ?

?) Disarmament of Germany.

The Cabinet had before them the following documents relative to the disarmament of Germany:-

A Report by Marshal Foch, President of the Allied Military Committee of Versailles, to the Conference of Ambassadors, (Paper C.P.-2465);

A Memorandum by the General Staff (paper C.P.-2472).

Major-General Sir W. Thwaites, the Director of Military Intelligence, and Major-General Bingham, the President of the section of the Inter-Allied Military Mission of Control dealing with the destruction of material, made verbal statements and answered questions supplementing the information contained in these Memoranda.

The principal point on which the Germans had failed to carry out the Treaty of Versailles and the decisions of the Boulogne and Spa Conferences, was in respect of the continued maintenance of certain formations over and above those permitted by the Treaty, which formations had been raised since the Ar?isties, and in respect of the guns, machine-guns and rifles in the possession of these unauthorised military forces. These forces included (i) the Sicherheitspolizei, (ii) the ?inwohnerwehr and Orgesch numbering perhaps altogether one million in the whole of ?, including 300,000 in Bavaria and 80,000 in East Prussia.

? NOTE BY THE SECRETARY. Arrangements for Sir L. Worthington Evans&apos; attendance have been made.
^^-&quot;Cx^s^la^ to supportlaw and order, the rights of property,and constitutional government;    It has/been declared illegal by the Prussianand Saxon authorities, but its founders are taking steps tohave this declaration reversed.If- due regard is paid to the great extent to which dis-armament has been already carried out, to the lack of ammu-nition,  and to the vast reduction of manufacturing facilitiesit is clear that the Germans could not constitute from theabove forces an army capable of resisting an Allied advancefrom the Rhine.    These forces had been organised and main-tained mainly with a view to the maintenance of internal order against a Communist insurrection,    In r.rast Prussia the potential enemy was Bolshevik Russia, and the isolation of east Prussia, together with its small garrison, called, from,the German point of view,  for the maintenance sf auxiliary forces of this character.    In Bavaria,- the memories of thetemporarily successful Spartacist revolt, and a possiblerecurrence of similar troubles, rendered the population ex-extremely nervous, and. so strong was the feeling that anyattempt to disband the Bavarian Einwohnerwehr would, it was represented, i.e&apos;t with forcible resistance.The Cabinet were informed that Marshal Pooh did not envisage in any case an Allied invasion of Bavaria.    He hadnot    sufficient troops for the purpose of such an invasionand for guarding his linv-s of communication.    If it were necessary to put pressure on Germany,  the Marshal would bewore likely to advise the occupation of the Ruhr, but inthis respect it had to be remembered that the Preach and belgian troops were inoor- plot - ly trained, while the numberof British troops available for such a purpose was negligibleThe British military view was in favour of giving theGermans a reasonable time for the reduction of the unauthor-ised forces.

Allies should confinethemselves to general: policy and leave the settlement, of details  (including, the fixing of dates), to. be left, for ar-rangemant with the German Government by the Allied Ambassadors- ,dors at Berlin^, advised by the Military Mission of Control..-   -In this connection emphasis was laid on the success of theBps, Conference^ which had resulted in the Germans carryingtheneutc in the wain, the engagements which they.hadyundertakento observe *    An alternative suggestion was that theGerman representatives should be invited, to Paris, but itwas felt that this would unduly prolong, the Conference..

) Reparations. ,      The. Oablne^-^TCt-^n^isi-^r-tS-&apos;- question of Repara-m tions.Mr HSF, Pass, of the Treasury, who &quot;Trad been present atthe Brussels Conference and had just returned froi Paris,gave the Cabinet advance particulars of the Report of the brussels Conference, which, as Lord D&apos;Ab.-rnon had reported by telegram, had been signed on the previous day.    It hadnot been found possible at Brussels to agree an estimate ofCmmam/&apos;s future capacity, to pay-, and it was accordingly felt to be unsafe to fix a. lower total figure than had been indicated at Boulogne;    At the moment there was ne possi-bility of fixing any total Reparation figure which would be acceptable both, to France and to Germany.    The Germans were now disposed to agree, as a temporary measure,  to postpone the fixing o^ Oe-many&apos;s total indebtedness for the time being and to make on arrange;&quot;: nt for the first five years, based on payment by Germany of not move than two milliards of goldmarks during the first two years, and three milliards of goldmarks during the last three yearsf the gross capital debt tobe fixed before the end of the five years,  and new annuitiessettled for subseouent years1:    in the first two years the major part o&apos; the payment to be in kind, and only a smallfraction in cash.    As part of the general settlement,  theGermans would press for certain concessions,  including thefollowing:-(i)  Germany to be released from the obligation of build ina ships for the Allies, and anyships not required by the Allies to,be re-turned to G-germany:I (ii)  In order to relieve- and stabilise the GermanExchange, tlm Clearing-house balances to be liquidated monthly and the total liability to be fiwad over a period of two years:(iii) All the Allies to *ollO&quot; Great Britain in giving up the right, under Article 13,to attach G-man private property:(iv) &quot;&quot;he release of German private property in allied ooert i e i.n necsssltous cr: s es ,- upto,  say.   2CO.
The Cabinet, were irrfbrmed &apos;that-,.in Lord D&apos;Abernon&apos;view,, the progress towards settlement of the Reparationsquestion might be regarded as entirely satisfactory.    Onthe other hand,  it was indicated that Sir John Bradburyfelt doubts as to the possibility of working the scheme.In this connection it was pointed out that there would bev^ry serious difficulties-over the method by which Germany-was to make payment in. Allied countries.    In particular,  itwas most important to secure that the payment would be made,without detriment to Great Britain&apos;o own trade and industry..The coal exports fro--:- Germany had already reached a pointbeyond the capacity of Prance for internal absorption, and she was  in fact selling her German imported coal to othercountries.    Potash and dryestuffs could only account for &apos;relatively small sums.    The suggestion was male that it -eightbe possible to institute son.-ft system of Export Tax on Germangoods, but this was likely to be criticis-d on the groundthat the British or other foreign importer would then bepayine G^m-nany1 s r^paratiermThe Cabinet wsre reminded o*&quot; the danger of postponing forsome time th    settlement o* the question of total Germanindebtedness and the eertaint.,  that such postponement wouldentitle Gem any to have the various itema s^t out and exam-ined,- which would lead to endless;dis^ussions relative tov alu as,   a-1 c.  et c *It was generally agreed that the whole subject 5should be mrtlme investigatedin Paris in consultation with lord&apos;Abernon and Sir John Bradbury, before,any discussion with the Allies tookplace at the Conmr nee,Turkey,-&apos; Greece, The Cabin-t then passed to a discussion of the TurkishBind the Sevres -    ,      . . . ,   ...     (, - ,preaty. Treaty.    mh.r- Cabin-.t -mr- remind:d o* tns attrtud- of f.snoand Italy, which, as illustrated by information from, all parts of the  east, as far as Afghanistan-, was, by means of intensive propaganda,  to rr-present themselves as, favouring a   ;drastic modification .of&apos; the T-.eafy of Sevres, and as- j
pointing to Great Britain as the obstacle to any modification. This propaganda took the form of advocating alterations at the sole expense of the Greeks. Even if such a scheme would satisfy the Turks, it would never fulfil the aspirations of other dissatisfied parties, such as the Arabs. The policy of Great Britain in Mesopota?ia was leading in the direction of an Arab settlement, and it was felt that the French ought to wake similar sacrifices in Syria. An all round agreed settlement, to which all the interested parties contributed by giving up claims, would afford the best hope of a peaceable solution of the Middle Eastern problem. In this connection it was represented that it was no use the Allies trying to insist on the l?tter of the Treaty of Sevres so long as they had no men or money, or the patience to carry their policy through; further, that it was no use insisting on the carrying out of the Treaty with an Eastern Government such as that now in power in Constantinople, which was unable to enforce its will on its own people. Above all, it would be fatal to our reputation in the East if we insisted on the full maintenance of the Treaty and yet allowed the Turks to tear it up before our eyes.

Doubts were expressed as to whether Mustapha Kemal would agree to any settlement which gave the Turks Smyrna but withheld Eastern Thrace and Adrianople. Further, it seemed doubtful whether the Greeks were willing to evacuate Smyrna merely because the Allies told ? to do so. Certainly public opinion in this country would not tolerate the use by the Allies of force to compel such an evacuation. If the Greeks liked to come into a general bargain of mutual concessions, the question might ? difficult to handle, but care must be taken not to alienate the Greek people without conciliating the Turks and Arabs.
The Cabinet were then reminded of the close connecting between the Middle Eastern question and the Greek question. King Constantine, having returned to Greece, was established on the throne, and seemed likely to remain there, at all events for some time, even if the Allies continued their policy of ostracism. The Venizelists, though not possessing a majority in the Greek Chamber, were actually the largest group, and their attitude was likely to be determined by the decisions of the Paris Conference. On the Smyrna front the Greeks were strong enough to resist any force which could be brought against them. On the Brussa front there had recently been fighting which each side represented as a success.  Whatever the precise military position was, a crash must inevitably ? in a few months&apos; time when King Constantine&apos;s lack of money would prevent the payment of the troops. It was most undesirable to adopt a policy of drift; the French would oppose such a policy, and it would certainly lose us the friendship of Greece, without enabling us to come to terms with Mustapha Kemal. To continue our policy of ignoring Constantine would involve a further fall in the drachma, and the disappearance of British trade. On the whole, therefore, it was suggested that the best course would be to revive the policy of recognising Constantine, on conditions to be laid down by the Allies.

The Cabinet were then reminded of the position at Constantinople. The Sultan&apos;s Government had behaved well, but was extremely feeble and on the verge of bankruptcy.

The Mission sent under Izzet Pasha to Angora had not returned, and reports as to its activities were conflicting. Possibly Izzet was awaiting the results of the Paris Conference.

General Harington estimated Mustapha Kemal&apos;s military resources at something between 30,000? and 80,000 men. Mustapha was opposed to the ? and to ? and the other extremists, but was a ? to ? with Moscow so long as he was in ? of money. It seemed possible that the fear
of a revived Russia, which was already threatening Persia and might soon become a menace to Turkey, might induce Mustapha Komal to seek reasonable terms rate the Allies.

It was suggested that the Treaty of Sevres in its main lines should be adhered to, more particularly in respect to Thrace, the Chatalja lines, and the guardianship of the Holt Places; further, that in the event of evacuation of Cilicia by France we should insist as a condition of our ratifying the Tripartite Agreement, that France should fulfil the obligations incurred in that Agreement in regard to the minorities in Cilicia, and that something should also be done for the protection of the Armenians. The settlement of the question of Smyrna might be made one of the conditions of the recognition of King Constantine. As the Turks attached great importance to possession the symbols of sovereignty, it might be possible to follow the precedents of the Eastern Rumolia and other former Turkish Provinces in Europe, and while retaining the Sovereignty of the Sultan set up a Christian Governor in Smyrna, under the general control and supervision of the League of Nations. This method might provide for a gradual transition of sovereignty and save the face of the Turks.

It was most important that neither Great Britain, France, Italy, nor the Allies as a whole, should send a Mission to the Turkish Nationalists. This would only raise the terms against the Allies. Constantinople might be a suitable place at which to hold a Conference, preferably with representatives of a Turkish Government which could speak for the whole of Turkey. It was also suggested that, in order to carry the Greek people with us, the Greek Government might be represented at such a Conference.
POST-OFFICE TELEPHONE RATES.

(2) The Cabinet had under consideration a Note by the Secretary (Paper C.P.-2471) covering the Reports of the Departmental Committee on Telephone Rates (Cmd.S? and of the Select Committee on Telephone Charges (Cmd. 247), and some discussion took place on the alteration of the rates which had recently agitated public opinion.

It was pointed out that the new rates could not come into operation in the case of old subscribers until the expiration of the three months&apos; notice, and it was estimated that there would only be about 500 new subscribers in London who would be affected by the rates up to the opening of Parliament.

The attitude of the Post Office was not challenged on merits, and it was generally recognised that the existing cost of maintenance and new extensions rendered the increase necessary, and that the proposed new scale of rates, on the whole, provided an equitable solution of the difficulty.

The Cabinet agreed -

(i)  That the Postmaster-General should make an announcement to the effect that there was no question of over-riding Parliament in this matter, and that if the Government should be over-ruled in Parliament an appropriate allowance should be made in the accounts of the new subscribers, to who? alone the increased rates would apply:

(ii) That, pending the discussion in Parliament, the revised trunk rates should be postponed:

(iii) That the Postmaster-General should prepare and circulate to the Cabinet, for information, the Post Office case for the increased rates, in as concise a for as possible.
