jJE FORTHCOMING       (1)     Tha Cabinet, -as a matter of urgency, had ellf-R- ALLIEDbsfEBENCS. short discussion with the Permanent Under Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs&apos; In&apos;regard to the forthcomingInter-Allied-Conference in Paris fixed for Wednesday next. .The prime Minister who, In view of the instabilityof the late French Government, had&apos; doubted the expediency.     -A.--of his. attending&apos;the Conference, considered that now, asa matter.-of courtesy towards &apos;the new Government , he ought to do so-.The general&apos;view was that, in view of the change.in the French Government, it would be advisable to post--pone the Conference sufficiently long to give time forthe new Government tc settle down and perhaps to obtainthe confidence of the Chamber.The Cabinet agreed( a) That,subject to the agreement of the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affaire, the british ambassador in Peris should  be instructed toinform the French Government that, in presentclrcums fences , it appeared to His Majesty^Government inconceivable that any FrenchMinistry, formed within the next day or two,could possibly be ready by Wednesday next toreceive the Allies representatives;    that,in order to remove the existing unsettledfeeling throughout Europe,&apos; the British Govern-ment considered It essential on this occasion to come to grips with the questions at issue and to reach decisions;    that they therefore considered it important that the French Gov-ernment should have time to confer an thevarious questions, in order to present their considered views;    and,  that,  therefore,  theywould propose-a -definite postponement of the&quot; date of the Conference sufficiently long tofacilitate this.Sir Eyre Crowe was authorised to add, for lord-Iardinge&apos;s private information, and for suchuse as he might deem It wise to make of it,&quot; that,&apos;&apos;if this course were adopted,  the French Govern-&apos;ment, before the Conference,.would probably haveto present their policy to the Chamber, end that&apos;&apos;,the character of their reception would be an im-*portent factor in the decisions to be taken;(b)   fhat,.before the Conference, the- Cabinet should&apos;diecuss the questions to be considered, whichmight Include the following:-.Disarmament of Germany-:Reparations by Germany   .Greece and Turkey.:Austria^

The attention o^ the Cabinet was drawn to the delayita Trial of   in bringing to trial persons in Ireland arrested on chargestersons ac-sused of of murder.fordor.Enquiries made from members of the Irish Administra-tion elicited that, owing to the risk involved to the lives of Counsel resident in Ireland, the present procedure was for the military authorities in Ireland to Instruct Counselin England in regard to  these oases.It was strongly urged that in the case of ten notablecharges for mutier committed in Dublin awaiting trial, whichwould constitute a great State Trial, the Prosecution shouldbe undertaken by the Irish Attorney-General in person, who,during  &apos;&apos;vw- Recess    is free from his heavy parliamentary duties.The Attorney-General for Irelandasreed.

pftHASBS -BY (7) The Cabinet were informed by ths Minister o* TrarsooimpANTBS ^^bthat the* railway-ay Companies had recently notified him o-r$PAIRS,  RR- Jj-pALS,  etc,    the great divergence in the tenders for the supply ofrailway material  (rails,  axle34  etc.  etc.)  submitted byBritish and foreign contractors.    In some cases american and Belgian quotations were only half the amount of Britishquotations.    In these circumstances the Railway Companies3ho^ to know whether, having regard to the unemployment situation,  they should for- the time &quot;being abandon theirnermal practice of buying in the cheapest market, and giveout their contracts to British firms irrespective of cost.In support of this policy it was urg-d that theGovernment had already instructed Public Departments to givea preference in the matter of contracts to British firms;that grave political difficulties with Labour would arise if orders which could be readily earri-d out in GreatBritain were sent to America, Belgium or Prance, and thatto send such orders abroad would be in direct conflict withthe principles of the draft Safeguarding of Industries bill and f^0 proposals set out in the Memorandum by the Presidentof the Board of Trade  (Paper CP.-2374)- covering that draftBill, and would open the Government (in the event of theBill becoming law)  to the charge of having made their ownpurchases in a cheap market and then presented private firmsby Statute from doing the same.Incidentally,  the Secretary of State  ror Indiamentioned that his Council had recently agreed,by a narrowmajority and aa a result of repr?sentations made by him,  togive Indian Rail--ay contracts to British firms, and thatif Bis Majesty&apos;s Government was now to adopt a differentpolicy he would feel bound to allow the Council to re-cons id *r the ir d---eis ion.On the other hand, it was pointed cut that to giveBritish firms an absolute preference in this matter wouldice an an addition of many millions to the railway deficit,
- wh-which addition would..Jha-ve to be met by the Exchequer;    thatit was to the interests of the Railway&apos; Companies to spendheavily on maintenance and repairs during the months whilethe Government  narantee remained in force;    but,  above all,that any policy which had the effect of maintaining inflatedwages and high profits at the boom level -would be /mostinjurious  to the country,  and that,   as it was  essential tobring home to Labour that wages rust inevitably fall withtee fall in th-3 cost of living,  no better example of the ill-effects of abnormal wages and profits could be furnishedthan would be afforded by the spectacle of these big con-tracts gating abroad.In the course of the discussion it was represented that, the divergency between the British and  foreign tenderswas due,,  in the*case of Belgium, France and 3-*germany,   to thecollapsed Exchanges, and,  in the case of America, to theheavy cuts  (amounting in some cases to  50 per cent.)  in rates of wages.    It was pointed out  that no r-auction ofwages and. profits, in the case of thm British contractors,would suffice to brine their prices down to the level ofEuropean -tvo^ tv,        *      competitors .    It was also urg - d that tneamount of preference which might be giver, to a Britishcontractor depended on the extent of the difference betweenthe British and foreign tender, and that there was less objection to giving a preference where that difference was small then where  tbr divergency was very great,A brie^ reference vas made to the proposals  con-stained in the Memorandum by the President of ftm Board ofTrade  (Paper CP,-2-374), and it was generally agreed thatit would be undesirable to embark on any policy which hadthe effect of maintaining the pre sent inflated rates ofwages and profits;    that, having regard to the reducedhours of labour end the himher standard of living,  it was essential, if national bankruptcy was to be averted,  thatGreat Britain should be able to so- pete with her foreign
rivals so far as possible without artificial alas or rsstric-tions&apos;    arid &quot;&quot;hat the beat hope for the future lay in increased production and reduced rates of wages.,-.The Cabin-t agreed  (a) That th--* Minister o; Transport shouldInfoaL the Railway Companies that thequeotior. of the allocation of their contracts, as betwoen British and foreignfirms,  -vas not a matter which called forth/.-. intervention of the.

*)w Settlement With reference to the Conference of Ministerspx-service tn Scotland.    held on Thursday,  50th December,. 1020,  at 5,45 p,m.the Secretary for Scotland stated that he had,  inconsultation with the Beard of Agriculture, gonevery thoroughly Into the problem set by the PrimeMinister, and had certain proposals to make*      Hesuggested that the principle should be adopted of accelerating settlement in the Crofting Districts endslowing it down in the Lowlands v      This should be done without any definite declaration of the policy, andLowland settlement, should proceed to a limited extent.In his opinion there were good grounds for justifyingthis policy,      First, settlement was more urgent inthe Crofting Districts - being an economic necessity.Second,  the danger of raiding and agrarian disturbancewas infinitely greater there, and third,  settlementsand enlargements could be more cheaply provided there.In the matter of costs ? the Board had gone very carefully into the problem and. they estimated that, onthe footing that the land, urns obtained on annual payment instead, of by capital payment,  that the costof equipment was reduced to a minimum, and  that theutmost assistance was exacted from the settler, theycould form in Crofting Districts new settlements andenlargements for an average sum of  500 each.On a similar footing, the Board had revisedtheir estimates for Lowland holdings and believed theycould provide the bare minimum equipment etc.-. at anaverage cost of  1,500 per holder.These figures would include loans for buildingsPprovision of fences, roads and  water, where necessary,loss on taking over sheep stock, and. compensation to tenants, but would not include provision for stock loans,
In regard to numbers and speed of settlement, theBoard believer)  they could make provision in about eighteen months for the settlement (including enlargements) of 2,000settlers In Crofting Districts, and 300 settlers in theLowlands, for a sum of  1,481-000,  exclusive of purchase price and loons for stock.      This sun wculd be available if the Board received  1,035,000 as recommended by theCabinet Committee, and could, as they anticipated, savea further sum of  398,000 by following as closely as posslblthe Committee&apos;s recommendations to reduce the scale of equipment on holdings, and by making no provision atpresent for expenditure on farms which are owned by theBoard but which fall out of lease in or after 1923.If these proposals were agreed to it should bepossible to make provision for the settlement In the nexteighteen months of 2,000 out of the 3,000 ex-serviceapplicants In the Crofting Districts, and 300 out of the1,400 ex-service applicants in the Lowland Districts,In reply to the suggestion by the Chancellor of theExchequer that the Board should accept the principle laiddown by the Cabinet Committee that loans for stock should only be given on the   for   basis, the Secretary forScotland stated he must adhere to his reservation on that point as in his opinion it was of vital importance thatthe Board should have discretion to make loans up to thefull amount in the case of sheep stocks *The Conference agreed
(1)    To accept the Secretary for Scotland8s proposals as indicated above cn the    understanding(1) that the additional funds to be providedby the Exchequer shall hot exceed thesum of  1,033.000 mentioned in paragraph37 (3) of&apos;the&quot;report and ii) that subject to (2) the recommendations contained in the Report of the LandSettlement Committee regarding economiesare put into operation.(2)    That with regard to loans for purchase of stock(Faragr-aph 31  (1) of Report) the Board ofAgriculture for Scotland should have discretion to advance in cases where they thought it essential to do so, a higher proportion of the stock value than 50 per cent.2,.
