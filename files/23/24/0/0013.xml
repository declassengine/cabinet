ISliIED CONFER-      (1) The Prdjre--Minister outlined to the Cabinet tb^ coursejflOE WITH THEISRMAN  ELE-   ef the negotiations which had taken place between the Allies[AT I ON.and the German Delegation on the. question of Reparation.He stated that it had been found impossible to arrive at anagreement.    It was therefore proposed to enforce the&quot;sanctions&quot;, and instructions were being, given for theimmediate occupation of Dusseldcrf, Duisburg and Ruhrort.Among the proposals which the Allies had put to the Germanswas one for the allocation to the Exchequer here of a pro-portion of the price of goods purchased directly from Germany,such proportion to be retained as part payment on accountof reparation, a receipt to be given by the Treasury to the purchaser in this country, who would send the receipt tothe vendor, who would recover from his awn Government.    Togive effect to this scheme legislation would be required.The Cabinet agreed  That the President of the Beard of trade should consider, in&quot;consultation with theTreasury, the form of legislation requiredto give effect to the absve proposal, andwhether it could be dealt with as a part, -of the Safeguarding of Industries Bill.
[&amp;8LEUM IN (S) &quot;With - refer eno-e * to - -war Cabinet 633, Conclusion 3. the:cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the President of,   the Board of Trade, covering a Draft Bill to vest in theCrown the property in petroleum within the United Kingdomand to wake provision with respect to the searching andboring for and getting petroleum and for purposes connected therewith, together with a copy of an Agreement made betweer.the Minister of Munitions and Messrs S. Pearson &amp; Sons, ltd.for the management of petroleum development(Paper C.P.-2482).The Cabinet were reminded that in October, 1919, ithad been decided that legislation should be introduced toprovide that  (a) The ownership of all petroleum from boringsIn the United Kingdom should be vested inthe State and no compensation should be paidto owners of land In respect of oil itself:(b) Compensation should be paid only in respectof disturbances to property and loss ofamenity.The Draft Bill now submitted had been prepared to giveeffect to this decision.The: Cabinet were also reminded that on October 22,1919, the Leader of the House of Commons had stated, inreply to a question, that  &quot;The Government have come to th?- decision that no royalty should be payable in thecase of oil&quot;*It was explained that the matter had become urgentlegal proceedings  following uponowing to/the discovery of oil&apos;by Messrs Pearson on the duke of Devonshire5s land in the Hardstoft Well.   This wellhad yielded about one ton per day for nearly twenty months,and It had been found necessary to sell some of the oil toprevent deterioration, the proceeds being paid into asuspense account.    The Duke&apos;s solicitors had served a writon the Petroleum Department,claiming the proceeds.   under their Agreement Messrs Pearson had, up to the present, spent in borings about  600,000 out of the  1,000,000 to which   -the Government were committed.
In the course or the discussion it was pointed outthat the position had materially changed since the decision taken in (So to her,  1919.    Experts were now generally convincedthat the amount of oil like!;,  to he obtained in this country-was negligible, that no special measures were therefore necessary to secure the property in oil to the State, andthat the most economical policy would be to terminate thePearson Agreement on the most favourable terms possible.It was further pointed out that a measure on the lines ofthe Draft Pill would meet with considerable opposition froma majority of the present House of Commons.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the draft Petroleum fill should not beintroduced1, and that tho legal proceedingsinstitutedby the Duke of Devonshire shouldtake their course:(b) That, subf-ct to the result of the Puke of devonshire&apos;s action, the President of theHoard of Trade should ho authorised tonegotiate with Messrs Pearson for the cancellation of the Agreement:(c) That, as provision would still be necessaryin the Estimates,  the Chancellor of theExchequer should be authorised to make such provision in trie way he deemed best,  afterconsultation with the President of the Boardof Trade and the- Minister of &quot;Munitions.
$GUARDING OP (5) The Cabinet bad before them a Memorandum by the3ST&amp;:es bill^&quot; 1      &quot;    pre-eldent of the Board of Trade (CeP.Bc^0) covering the draft.-Safeguarding of Industries Bill as revised bythe Cabinet Committee which had recently consideredthe subject, and also a Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for India (C0p,2676) drawing- attention to certainobjections to the Bill in its new form.jfeguarding of      (a)   With regard, to Part I of the Bill (Safeguardinglj Industries,of Key Industries)    the Cabinet were reminded that thei   . original intention had been to retain if possible forthe State some part of the profits which would result from the protection given by the Bill, and it wassuggested that either some limitation of profits shouldbe laid down or that some speoial form of taxation shouldbe imposed on income derived, from the protected products of the - Key Industry.     It was also -urged that havingregard to the great importance from the point of viewof tho State of scouring that the protected industries were maintained in an efficient manner so as to be ready in the event of a national oraergenoy. speoial provisions should be inserted in the Bill to ensure efficient....conduct and maintenance.&apos;The Cabinet were informed that these considerationshad been most oarefully reviewed by the Cabinet Committee)which, after full dlsoussion, had come to the conclusionthat so far from the affeoted industries being likelyto make substantial profits as:a result of the protection given them by the Bill, the rate of duty might not besufficient to do more than enable the majority of those industries to continue to exist, .   Any scheme for tho&apos; limitation or special taxation of profits involved
rigorous. Sta to--control, -anchinte-rfeorenoo.r--and. -the Committeehad decided that it would not be wise to do more than requirethe industries to furnish the returns of production, etc.as provided for in Clause 2 of the Bill-As regards efficient maintenance, it was pointed outthat in one industry there, might be efficient and inefficientfirms, and that if. as provided in the Bill, tho protectionwas to be given by means of a duty on tho foreign product,It would not bo possible to differentiate in favour of the efficient firms.     Furthers it would be most difficult,ifnot impracticable, to ensure efficiency by Act of parliament,and this could only, in any ovent, be attainable by settingup a complex, expensive and inquisitorial administration which would not be tol orateI by tha commercial oommunity.Por these and similar reasons, tho Cabinet Committee had thought It undesirable to attempt to lay down ite special provisions   in tho Bill.     The Schedule to the Bill could notbe onlarged by administrative action.     Clause 1 (r) onlyconferred on the Treasury referee a power to decide whetheror not a particular commodity fell within one of the items in the Schedule.:       : &quot; . e,Mention      (b)   The Cabinet then proceeded to discuss Partll of the -jDumping.Bill (Prevention of Dumping).     Objection was taken to theaotion of the -Cabinet Committee in amalgamating-the Dumpingand Collapsed Bxohange Parts of the Bill, it being pointedout - i(l) that, whereas the former called for legislation of a permanent, rbnraeior. . the latter was dueto abnormal trans vt ory conditions, and onlyrequired temporary remedies;    and(2) that it would apparently be open to the Boardof &apos;^rado to impose Duties on commodities, froma country whose Exchange had only collapsedto a very slight extent.The
$ The President of tho Board of Trade informed the.Cabinet of the reasons which had led the Committee to amalga-mate Parts II and III of the previous Draft Bill, and under-took to insert a provision in tho present draft limiting thecollapsed Exchange arrangements to a period of 3 years.Tho facts that employment in an industry must &quot;be. seriously affected, and that the expert Committee must satisfy itself in various respects., safeguarded the &quot;position so far asslightly collapsed Exchanges were concerned.It was then represented that the inclusion of theCollapsed Exchange provisions in the Bill was certain to raiseserious political and other difficulties.     Any effective measures in this direction would tend to prevent that revival of the collapsed Exchanges which was essential to the A-restoration of international trade and commerce.     It might bopreferable to allow certain industries to porish if the effect was to strengthen and encourage other industries for whichthe conditions in Great Britain were better adapted.     Critic-ism was also directed against the vagueness of the expressionsin Clause Z (1)  (b) &quot;Prices at Which similar goods can beprofitably manufactured in this country&quot;, and the subsequentwords &quot;by reason whorcof employment of any industry in the United Kingdom Is being, or is likely tc bo, seriously affected1&apos;On tho other hand the Cabinet were reminded that the.real danger to vital British industries at the moment was due&quot;dumping&quot;not to^ in the ordinary scrmje. hoi to collapsedExamplesExchanges. .   , - wore given of foreign tenders far belowthe cost of production of similar commodities in this country.Tho Bill would be criticised from all sides, and it would be strongly reprosuntei that the collapsed Exchange provisionsdid not go far enough. -    While it was no doubt most desirablethat.,...
that the fojce^4^.Jibi i^^ he restored, this should uc?tae doue at tho cole expanse of Great Britain.     owing toour geographical proximity to the Continent the tendency ofcollapsed ixohango countries ima to use our market in preference to thr-so further afield, and we could not hopo to retain our overseas markets if great, vital and essential industries athome wero destroyed,,      it was also pointed out that while theoollap3ed ilxchange acted as a bounty to the foreign, exporter,it at the same time constituted a prohibition as against the british exporter.    If thought desirable the words &quot;foreignvalue&quot; could be substituted for the words lrcost of production&quot;.The Cabinet agreed -To adjorarr tho further consideration oftho Draft Safeguarding of IndustriesBill until the next Mooting.Whitehall Gardens,Oth. March, 1921.
