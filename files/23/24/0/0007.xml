(1) With reference to Cabinet 4 (21), Appendix II (3),the Cabinet had under consideration Memoranda by the Minister of Labour (Papers CP.-2561 and CP.2562) on the subject of Unemployment Insurance. In the latter Memorandum the proposa1 was made to introduce a Bill amending the unemployment Insurance Act for the following purposes:-

(i) To bring ex-Servioe men within the pro-visions of the Act:

(ii) As from March 14, 1921,  to increase the weekly rate of benefit,from 15/- to 20/- for men, and the rates for women and children proportionately:

(iii) To extend the number of weeks during which benefit may be received in any one insurance year from 15 to 26 weeks.

Special provision was also made to cover the periods of acute unemployment during the next few months and during the winter of 1921-22.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer reminded the Cabinet that if the rate of Unemployment Benefit were raised, the claims for increasing Sickness Benefit under the National Health Insurance Act would be strongly pressed, and the double effect of increasing both rates of benefit would be more than industry could bear. But assuming that the Government were prepared to insist on Sickness Benefit not being raised above the present level, there was much to be said for the Minister of labour&apos;s proposals to place the Unemployment Insurance on an adequate and permanent basis at 20/-,upon which it would be possible to make a firm stand against any further concessions. 

Under the Ministry of Labour proposals the cost to the State in increased contributions wouldbe £781,000, but in addition it was proposed to draw uponthe accumulations of the Insurance Fund amounting to £22,000,000.    There was a two fold liability on that Fund at present:- 

i) To act as an actuarial reserve for the purpose of repaying the sum total of their accumulated contributions, plus 21/2 per cent compound interest, less benefits drawn,  to insured persons attaining tho ago of 60.
(ii) To fom a reserve, built up during periods of abnormally good trade, for meetingperiods of abnormally tad trade.On the other hand, it was stated that a goneral level ofunemployment of 9-^- per cent, of insured persons, extending over a period of 16 months, ?;ould totally exhaust the Tjnem-ployment Fund, while an unemployment rate of IS per oent ofinsured persons extending over the same period would involvethe Exchequer in a liability of  13,5o0,000.    It was impossi-bie to contemplate a proposal v/hich might leave the Fundabsolutely depletedi having regard to the actuarial liability-ity in respect of persons attaining the age of 60.    Moreover,inasmuch as the Unemployment Fund was calculated on anaverage rate of 5 per cent of unemployed, if the rate ofunemployment were above that level alter the expiry of the15 months period, more money would be paid out in benefitthan was being received in contributions.      It was therefore necessary to maintain a reserve both against the liability of those going out of insurance, and to meet tho rich ofthe rate of unemployment being above .5 per cent.For this purpose a reserve in the neighbourhood of  .10,000,000ought to exist in July 1922.    In order to effect economies, theChancellor of the Exchequer suggested that in any Billgranting an increase of benefit, certain amendments in thepresent Act should be mado to meet defects and possible improvements which experience had shown to be necessary(1) Where a husband is working full time, the wife should not be entitled to draw Unom-ployment Benefit:(ii) The weekly allowance should be diminishedafter the unemployed person had drawnbenefit for a certain period:(iii) Payment at the increased rates should be postponed until the increased contribution-tions began to be collected:(iYi Unemployment Benefit should not be paidconcurrently with wages for short time.The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to the state-meat pf the position in the Memorandum by the Minister ofLabour, referred to above, from which it appeared that
(It) To Torn a reserve, built up daring periods of abnormally good trade, for meetingperiods of abnormally bad trade.On the other hand, it was stated that a goneral level ofunemployment of      per cent, of Insured persons, extending over a period of 16 months, would totally exhaust the unem-ployment iPund, while ah unemployment rate of 12 per cent ofinsured persons extending over the same period would involvethe Exchequer in a liability of  12,500,000.    It was imposei-ble to contemplate a proposal which might leave the Fundabsolutely depleted, having regard to the actuarial liability-ity in respect of persons attaining the age of 60.   Moreover,inasmuch as the Unemployment Pund was calculated on anaverage rate of 5 per cent of unemployed, if the rate ofunemployment were above that level after the expiry of the16 months period, more money would be paid out in benefitthan was being received in contx-ibntiono.      It was therefore necessary to maintain a reserve both against the liability of these going out of insurance, and to meet the risk ofthe rate of unemployment being above.5 per cent.Per this purpose a reserve in the neighbourhood of  10,000,000ought to exist in July 3.922.    In order to effect economies, theChancellor of the Exchequer suggested that in any Billgranting an increase of &quot;benefit, certain amendments in thepresent Act should be made to meet defects and possible improvements which experience had shown to be necessary:-(i) Where a husband is working full time, the wife should not be entitled to draw Unom-ployment Benefit:fii) The weekly allowance should be diminishedafter the unemployed person had drawnbenefit for a certain period:(iii) Payment at the increased rates should be postponed until the increased contribu-tions began to be collected:(IV, Unemployment Benefit should not be paidconcurrently with wages for short time.The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to the state-ment pi the position in the Memorandum by the Minister oflabour, referred to above, from which it appeared that
not - erury -^onild^of about 1,000,000 workpeople, but that all other sources of &apos;revenue vhich had supplemented Unemployment Benefit wo aid atthe aarre time hake come to an end, notably Trade Union benefit and private savings,    The position was,  therefore, of greatseriousness4 and,as som-thing must be done, the present momentappeared appropriate.ate--to pum^e ^sainloycient Xneurance on apermanent b-ao4,x3-at.-eu.ch a rate as might reasonably be ex-nectQd to support a workman.    It waa only by such means thatit would be possible to preserve the contributory principle.If the rate were raised to 20/- for men, it should bO possibleto revert to the original waiting period of six days, insteadcf three, as at present^ and thereby &quot;avoid many of the abusesof administration,,   At the same time it was hoped that theproposal to postpone the payment of the 20/- until conbribu-tions were being paid at the increased rates would not be pressed^    It was particularly at the present time, whenpeople were out of employment and therefore not paying com-tributions,  that the increased rate of benefit was so urgently required.    It would, moreover, be impossible,  if that condi-tion&quot;were made, to bring ex-Service men into the Insurancescheme on the expiry of the Out-of-Work Donation,The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated, in reference to thelatter point,  that he was prepared to meet the case of the ex-Service men by paying out of the Exchequer the additional 5/-until such time as the general level of benefit were raised to SO/-,    On the other hand, provided means were-secured ofaccumulating the necessary reserve of  10,000,000 in the Unem-ployment Fund,  the exact method was open to consideration.The Cabinet were impressed with the impropriety of allowingworkmen en short time to drcv, Unemployment Benefit, and were of opinion that the increased lates of contribution should beb-ome equally by employers and employed, instead of the total contribution from the employer being 6d. and that of the workman 5d, as proposed by the Minister of Labour.
The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to a case which.had occurred of men refusing to work short time, in order to preserve tbr ir Unemployment Bern fit.    It was explained tothe Cabinet that --hire/the case of a particular individualrefusaa   to work would disqualify from - eceiving bens fit,the provisions o*&quot; the Act could be, and no doubt were being,evaded by the refusal of a Trade Union to agree to its mem-bers working short time, the object of such refusal being to.secure the continuance of Unemployment Benefit.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To accept the principle of an increase inthe rate of Unemployment Benefit from 15/-,in the case of men, to SO/-, with pr^por-tionate increases for women and children,on the following conditions:-(i) That the rate of Sickness benefit under the National Health InsuranceAct would be maintained as at present:(ii) That an adequate reseiwe should be kept in the Unemployment Fund, in the neigh-bourhood of  10,000,000:(b) Tc appoint a Committee, consisting of  The Minister of Labour (Chairman),The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The President of the Board of Trade,Sir L, Wo r tiling ton Evans,The Minister of Health.The Secretary for Scotland,Mr Pembroke Wicks (Secretary),(i) To consider proposals,  to be submittedby tho Minister of Labour, in consulta-tion with the Government Actuary, for amending the Unemployment Insurance /ctso as to permit the above rates ofbenefit being paid, subject to theaforesaid conditions, and, if possible,to the payment of equal contributions by the employer and bg the workman:(ii)  To  consider amendments to the UnemploymentInsurance Act for the purpose of s-curingthe reforms suggested by the Chancellorof the Exchequer,  and remedying the defectsto which the attention of the Cabinet hadbeen called,
OPENING OP (2) The Cabinet had before them a preliminary draft ofPARLIAMENT.  the King&apos;s Speech to be delivered at the forthcoming open-Draf    of theKingTa Speech.ing of Parliament, based on material supplied by the various(Jovftrniront Departments and prepared by Mr Philip Kerr (paper.P.-2555), and alse Memoranda by the Lord Chancellor onthe legislation to amend the Marriage Laws (Paper C.P.-2588) and by the Secretary of State for India on the qucs-tion ef the Preservation of Birds (Paper C .1.^2548).Before considering the Draft Speech, the cabinet discussed the question of the I?llls to be specifically mentioned therein, and it was generally agreed that, in thecircumstances, ^nly those Bills should be definitely r-fer-red to which either implemented Government pledges of amost absolute nature,or which were demanded by imperativepublic necessity.   At the same time it was clearly understoodthat the omisdid-n ^ror the Spe ch of particular Bills didnot preclude the introduction of those Bills should theCabinet decide - later in the Session that such a course wasnecessary or desirable.In the course of the discussion special reference was made to the &apos; ill for the Amendment o^ the Marriage Laws,which, apart from Clause IV, might be regarded as non-contentious, and to vvhich Bill the House of Lords had lastyear devoted very prolonged and careful consideration.It was suggested that if the Cabinet felt unable to treat the Bill as a Government measure, it night be re-introduced in the House of Lords, on the understanding that if itasraln passed that ^ouse the Government would be preparedto    ive it greater facilities than are usually accorded toa Private IvP-mber&apos; s Bill,Reference was also made to the question of the Reforr.of tlri House of Lords, and it was urged that, in view of&quot; the calls upon the time of Ministers and the magnitude andcomolevity of the subject, it would be impracticable topass legislation on the subject into law during the present session.
The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the only Bills to he mentioned inthe iCing^ Speech should be those deal-ing with unemployment Insurance,The Safeguarding of Industries,The Re-organisation of the Railways,The Sale of Alcoholic Liquor,Irish Land Purchase,andOhuroh Union in Scotland;(b) That the omission of certain Bills fromthe original draft (paper CP .-2553) shouldnot preclude Ministers from bringing forwardthose Bills for consideration at a later stage should Parliamentary exigencies permit.(a) that tho Secretary of State for India shouldbe at libetty to proceed with the Governmentof Burma Bill.The Cabinet then proceeded to examine the Draft speech in detail, and, after various alterations had been made,the Cabinet approved the Draft Speech for submission toHis Majesty.    (For amended Draft see 0,P.2555).COMMITTEE ON (2)    The Cabinet approved the appointment of theIILWAY AGREE-SHITS, following Committee to consider the Report of the DepartmentalCommittee on Railway Agreements, presided over by Lord Colwyn(Paper C.P.-2579)The Chancellor of the Exchequer (Chairman),The Lord Chancellor,The Secretary of State for India,The President of the Board of Trade,The Minister of Tx*transport,The Attorney-General,Mr. R4Bo Howorth (Secretary),Mr. So Twentyman (Assistant Secretary).2, Whitehall Gardens,February 11, 1921.S.W.li
