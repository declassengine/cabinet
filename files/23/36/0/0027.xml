I&apos;POCtHBNT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAPNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)iBET.VMOTE of a Conversation between Sir Edward Grigg.Mr. Vsnsittart of the Foreign Office and *   /la, Venlzelos, on the morning of Saturday,        -      / 0September 30th? 1922p(Circulated in accordance with ConclusionConference of Ministers, September 30th,. at 4-0 p0m*)PRIME. MINISTER tAs instructed by pcurself and Lord Curzon.  ; -Mr, Vanslttart and I went to call on Monsieur Venizelos thismorning and told him that we had come with a view to securingfrom him any information which he could give upon events in greece and his general estimate of the situation^He said that, as we knew, he had been&apos;withdravai from public life for a long time, and for the moment he could onlygive us, under all reservej his personal Impressions derivedmostly from the papers and partly from friendscHe had received In Paris yesterday a request from theRevolutionary authorities that he should represent theinterests of Greece abroadi   . He had replied that he could come to no decision tot 11 he knew:*- -(1)     The policy which they had in&apos;view a(2)     The peace terms which they would be willing toaccept, and their view of the alternative if these could not he secured by Conference,(3)     The condition of the Army as regards numbers,equipment, organisation and morale..(4)     The financial condition of the country*Ha hoped to receive an advance report of all thesematters In the course of to-morrow as he had particularly asked that they should send him some information at once,and more detailed information as it became available.     Inhis opinion the Revolution was absolutely national in character.The Committee which had invited him to represent the countryconsisted of eleven officers, only two of which had belonged/to
to his original National Party of Defence, the other nine &quot;beingRoyalists.      He was convinced that they had carried out theRevolution with sanity and clearness of view, and that they hadbehind them the national sentiment of all Greece,With regard to the Army, he said that their defeat had notin reality been a military defeat at all.     Their morale has firsto&amp; all been underminec^by the removal of the officers of experience in whom all ranks had great confidences and that then the worstpossible Comnander-in-Chief had been sent to. the Front.     ThisCommander-in-Chief, General Hadjianesiiis, had announced immedi-ately on his arrival in Asia Minor that the Greek Army should never have been sent there, that it was on a fool&apos;s errand, and thatho proposed to take it out,-,      hhen the Turkish attack followed, very soon after this declaration, it was natural that the whole Armyasked what it was fighting for and why it was not being withdrawn.Under all reserve he gave the following - estimate of themilitary position:--(l)     That there were seven Divisions Which had not sufferedseriously in morale and which could be very rapidlyre-organised.(2)     That the chief difficulty with the troops was theentire lack of equipment and supplies..     He saidsou to buy tobacco or any other, little luxury forten months past; that they had only had meat once a week for many months.past; and that they had beensuffering terrible hardships  or some time past-owing to lack of clothing and even of boots*iiaathat the troops of Asia,Minor had not/a singleThat their morale would be restored immediately ifthey learned that Great Britain was .at war with turkey and that they would he. fighting at.. GreatBritain&apos;s side,-2-(4)
(4)    That strong reinforcements would, in his opinion,be available after reorganisation if Greeneunderstood that Great   Britain was fighting asher Allyilie explained again that these wete his personal views and that we must hot take thfira as official statements on be-half of Greece-.     He would give us his official informationas soon as he received it.I asked hin whether it had been suggested that he himself should return to GreeeeiHe replied that he had no Intention of doing so,except possibly for a few days If he thought that his presence might be Of use.       His object in going there wouldbe to bull the country together and give it the inspiration&apos;whioh he believed \without vanity he would be able to do,  butnot to stay there or to take office in a Government.   For himto take office at this time would., in his opinion, beharmful to the unity of the country.     However constitution-ally he might act,  he would in reality find himself adictator-.     Such elements of opposition as might remain,would, he &quot;thought,  be very email, &quot;but his presence woulddrive them underground , and instead of taking a constitu-tional form they would lead to unrest and disturbance here and there in the country at a moment when the   Union Bacrdewas the essential requirement of Greece.    If he undertook to serve his country wi without taking office everyone would realise that he was acting,  not as a party leader anxiousto come back into the powdr which he had lost,; but as a true representative of the whole nation anxious onlyto heal its divisions and save its interests at a verycritical moment in its history.- He
He expressed the hope that the new. sovereign would establish himself firmly upon the throne and would reignfor many years.     He. himself would do his best to securethat result.With regard to Prance, he said that he.had not seen  , .^  .M. Poincare for,two or three months but that he had calledat the Qua! d&apos;Orsay yesterday and had asked for an immediate   -interview wi th Mi Poincare on the. groiuid that he was leavingdire oily for England where he proposed to enter into communi-vcation with the British Government,- and that he; would liketo have a convers.ati.on with it. Poincare. first.     It.. Poincarehad been out of Paris arid had, therefore made an appointment : ,;for Tuesday n^xt.     M. Venizelos had then said that he would come over to London first, and return to Paris, afterwards. ,With regard to other, States he had seen only M- Nine id,and that was. just before the outbreak of the Greek Revolution,His conversation with M. Nincic had! tmfortunately been cutoff by the entry into the room of. the King of Serbia...   He had remained, in conversation with the King for a few minutes huthad then felt it his duty to leave and had not had anotheropportunity of finishing his talk with M. Kincic,     The gist of M. Nincic*a conversation, so far aa it had gone, was this that the Serh-Croat-Slovene Government had been placed undervery great pressure by.the French.Government to abstain fromplaying, any part in the crisis except in subservience to Frenchpolicy, and they had.not been able,to resist this pressure for the present, ,    ...(XT.B. There is. a . Belgrade telegram: amongst the ForeignOffice telegrams to-day which&apos;explains that france had made a loan of 100 million francs to the Serb-- Croat-Slovene Government for military equipment etc.)He then explained that in his opinion his country mustI asked him whether he ..had/ahy - communication. with ,the French or the Balkan Governments.endeavour/
endeavour, If possible, with, the help of. the Balkan States,to prevent the return of Turkey to Thrace.     His opinion was that Prench policy in the Hear East was not only antl-Chrlstian and ahtl-European (these rare trifles), but it v/aseven anti-French.     Turkey could not possibly maintain herself in Europe except with the assistance of a solid Russian andBulgarian bloc, very probably assisted by Germany,   . Such abloc would be very dangerous to the Little &quot;Entente and very embarrassing to France which.had counted a great deal on the little Entente, and.would find the.Little Entente hampered at every turn by this hostile Eastern bloc when France requiredtheir, services elsewhere..It was perfectly clear frcstv the whole tone of his. cbn-versation that be took a militant view of the position andbelieved his country still capable of fighting; for itsreputation In Europe and-its position.in.Thrace. .   He declaredas we left, that, the soul of. Greece, was not dead, and that, he believed he could revive her but.-that. he. pa shed to preserve . .her national unity at the present moment, by all possible means *As we, left the house he added -that. we,, must. not over-rate theKamal 1st army,- \ - It had- had a political victory,-, not a militaryone,--and-:as a military organisation it was  a poor thing.. -(Signed)   E.W.M.
