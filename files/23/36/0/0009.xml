SCHANZER.   stage which had been reached in the Conversations withM. Schanaer.THE PRIME MINISTER asked whether there was anything which the British Government required from the Italians?Answering his own question, he said that they had already given us valuable support in connection with the questionof Reparations, and at the Genoa Conference.    That had proved of real value, and it would be useful to be ableto count on it.LORD BALFOUR agreed that up to now they had supportedus and that the support had been useful, though how farthat could be counted on in the future it was difficultto say.
THE DODECANESE.      The Conversation then passed to the Dodecanese, andthe suggestion was made that the British Government might ask to be represented at a Conference between the greeks and Italians, in order to see that fairplay was given tothe Greeks in regard to the Dodecanese.    We should have just as much right to be represented at such a conference as the Italians had to be represented at the ConferenceonTangier.   Another suggestion was made to the effectthat Stampalia might be handed back to the Greeks on thesame understanding as Lentnos had been handed back, faamely,that if required as a naval base by the Allies it shouldbe available for this purpose.This plan, however, was hardly thought feasible, as itwas doubtful if it would meet with the approval of theLeague/6 f Nations, with whom any such Treaty would have tobe registered.LORD balfour recalled that the Dodecanese were origin-ally part of Turkish territory.    Every portion of theTurkish territory which had been handed over to theprincipal Allied Powers had been placed under mandate, andit was not allowable to construct naval bases.m CORFU ^he Conversation then passed to the question of thePANNEL.Corfu Channel.Mr VANSITTART said it was true that an Agreement hadbeen signed between the Greeks and Italians in regard tothe neutralisation of the Corfu Channel, but it had beenconditional on the handing back by the Italians of the dodecanese to the Greeks, and subject to support by theItalians to the Greek claims in Smyrna and Albania.The Italians had not fulfilled any of these conditions and consequently had nfc right to demand enforcement ofthis Agreement.   He had been informed confidentially thatthe desire of the Italians to neutralise the Corfu Channel
was from fear of Prance and not of Greece.LORD balfour pointed out that the French could not &apos;the Corfu Channel unless the Greeks were a belligerenttheir side.same course as M, Poincare&apos; and return home without any agreement being signed.   He should content himself withsaying that cordial conversations had taken place and progress had been made, hut that in the time available ithad not been possible to reach any (Agreement.   He was allin favour of helping M. Schanzer, whose political position might depend on the success of his negotiations in London;,but he would be returning in July, when these questions,which involved much detail, could be again taken up.    Thedesire of the Italians to take part in the Tangier negotia-tions was rather inconvenient.LORD balfour recalled that the further conversations with M. Poincare had originally been proposed by M.Poincarehimself for the purpose of further discussions on Repara-tions.    Tangier had been an after-thought.Mr VANSITTART doubted if the Report of the ReparationCommission would be ready by the end of July, or beforethe end of August.LORD balfour thought it was difficult to postpone theConference until the end of August, because that wouldinvolve taking some action in regard to Turkey without aConference.    M. Schanzer, however, thought the best plan was to leave the Eastern question alone.THE PRIME MINISTER recalled M. Venizelos&apos;s confidence in the Turks, who, he had said, would always spoil theirown prospects by their clumsiness.FUTURE of the OONVER-SATIONS .THE PRIME MINISTER recalled a proposal he had. made toM. Schanzer on the previous day, that he should adopt the2, Wb71ehal1 Ga rden s,June SO, 193?..-3-
