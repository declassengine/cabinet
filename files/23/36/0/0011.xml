PRIME &apos;MINISTER&apos;S ROOM, HOUSE OP COMMONS,  S.W.1,ON WEDNESDAY, JULY 5, 1922,  at 6.20 p.m.PRESENT:-The Right Hon. D. Lloyd George, O.M.,M*P,,Prime Minister,The Right Hon. The Earl of Balfour, K,G.,0.M.,Acting Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs.Mr R.G. Vansittart, C.M.G.,M.V.O,, ForeignOffice.Sir Maurice Hankey, G.O.B., Secretary.LORD balfour said he wished to confer with the PrimeMinister as to the future conversations with M, Schanzer.He had had prepared in the Foreign Office a draft setting forth what he conceived to be the terms which the BritishGovernment would be prepared to agree to.   After obtaining the Prime Minister&apos;s approval he proposed to send this toM. Schanzer on the following day and to give M. Schanzer24 hours in which to study it, as he himself had to visitCambridge to confer degrees.   He also proposed to placeM. Sehanzer in touch with the Board of Trade with a viewto arranging a settlement on the question of shippingItalian emigrants.    On Friday he hoped to be in a positionfinally to conclude the Agreement.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed with this general prodedure.GENERALPROCEDUREIN THE CON-TBRSATIONSIITH M.SCHANZER,,
Sst!BAR Mr VANSITTART &quot; was also proposed the same eveningto give M. Schanzer a copy of the despatch to Paris onthe subject of the Near Past, which had been read to M.Schanzer at the previous meeting.    He also asked for authority to press M, Schanzer about the refusal of theItalian Government to allow the Greeks to exercise theright of search on the high seas.THE PRIME MINISTER and LORD balfour entirely agreed with the course proposed by Mr Vansittart.lord BAItPOUR then read the Draft Agreement prepared inthe Foreign Office, Article by Article.Articles I, II, III, IV, V and VI were approved bythe Prime Minister without alteration.THE DODECANESE     LORD BALFOUR sadd his personal view was that it wasAMD JUBALAND.not logical to link up these two qixestions.    The question, of Jubaland arose from the Treaty of London in 1915,    Thequestion of the Dodecanese arose out of an arrangement made in 19S0.    There were three courses available.    First,to insist on the return of the Dodecanese to Greece.    Ifthis attitude were taken, the Italians would undoubtedlythrow over the whole Agreement.    Second, to hand overJubaland and say that the Dodecanese was a question forthe Italians to settle with the Greeks, but should not beput into this Agreement.    If this course were adopted,the Italians would probably never hand back the Dodecaneseat all.    mhe third course was the one proposed in theForeign Office draft, or, rather, in a revised paragraphprepared at his suggestion, which he then proceeded to read.    The gist of this was that we should undertake to hand over Jubaland within a fixed period, and that theItalians should undertake to carry out their treaty with the Greeks on the subject of the Dodecanese,subject to any Agreement they might arrive at with the-2-
Greeks within six months.    In this event we would consent to the neutralisation of the Corfu Channel.(The Lord Chancellor entered at thispoint to see the Prime Minister on another question, hut took no partin the discussion.)LORD balfour said that the reason why he had misgivingsin regard to suggesting any modification in the Agreementbetween the Greeks and Italians with reference to the dodecanese was that,although we knew in our hearts that unless such modification were made the Italians would not-hand over the Islands, nevertheless this would not saveus from being reproached by the Greeks as having betrayedthem.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed, but he felt that we ought touse Jubaland to give us the whip hand over the Italians onthe question of the Dodecanese.    He then reverted to aproposal he had made at a previous meeting, that six months should be given for the Italians to settle with the greeks and that some date subsequent to that should be fixed forthe handing over of Jubaland.    In reply to Lord Balfour,he said he. would not definitely impose conditions, but hewould introduce the two questions into the Agreement- insuch a way that the Italians would be able to see that both formed part of a single Agreement.LORD BALFOUR agreed in this plan.    He thought that if itwere adopted the two questions should be dealt with inseparate paragraphs.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed, and suggested that theyshould be consecutive.It was agreed -(a) That the questions of .Jubaland and the dodecanese should be dealt with in sep-separately paragraphs:(b) That six months from the conclusion ofthe Agreement should be allowed for the
Italian Government to settle with theGreek Government on the question of the dodecanese:(c) That the handing over of Jubaland shouldbe fixed for May or June, or some conve-nient date, in 1923:setting forth the general desire for friendship betweenGreat Britain and Italy, in which the Prime Minister eon-curred.HE PREAMBLE.LORD balfour then read the Words of the Preamble,2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,July 5,  1922.

ANNEX No. 1.Palestine.(1)-     The British Government assure the ItalianGovernment that nothing will he done in establishing a national home for the Jewish people in Palestinewhich might prejudice the civil or religious rightsof the existing non-Jewish Communities in Palestine.(2).     Article 11 of the draft mandate for palestine is not intended to preclude the participation of italian enterprise in public works, services andutilities and in the development of the national re-sources of the country so far as these matters are not directly undertaken by the Administration.     In theevent of such participation Kis Majesty&apos;s Governmentare prepared favourably to consider a special arrange-ment being negotiated with the Italian Government toregulate the conditions of such Italian labour as might consequently be admitted into Palestine.(3).     The British Government assure the ItalianGovernment that under the constitutional proposals that are now under consideration for Palestine, HisMajesty&apos;s Government have included provisions in virtueof which foreign nationals, including of course ItalianCitizens, should have the right to be tried by a Courtwith a majority of British judges;    except in trivialcases in which these provisions would lead to ad-ministrative inconvenience, and that in this caseforeign nationals would have the special right to appeal
appeal to a Court composed with a majority of Britishjudges.(4).     The British Government assure the ItalianGovernment that the use of the word &quot;maintain&quot; inArticle 15 of the draft mandate was not intended to restrict the opening, of new Italian schools or to restrict the right of such schools to admit pupilsof another community.(5)..     The British Government assure the ItalianGovernment that the second clause of Article 16 of thedraft mandate is intended to show that the supervision of the mandatory will he strictly limited to that-required for the maintenance of public order and good government.     They add that there is no intention ofpermitting any arbitrary interference in the internal affairs of any religious community.(6).     The British Government assure the ItalianGovernment that in the event of the Italian economicalzone in Asia Minor materialising, and in the eventof any customs arrangement being concluded with theFrench Government in respect of sea-borne commercebetween Palestine and Syria, His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould give a favourable consideration to any proposalsfor a similar arrangement to be entered into with theItalian Government in respect of sea-borne traffic between Palestine, on the one hand, and the Italianeconomic zone and Rhodes on the other.(7).     The British Government assure the ItalianGovernment that consignments imported for the use of italian schools, orphanages, asylums, hospitals anddispensaries
dispensaries in Palestine should be admitted free of duty.

Consignmentsintended for the use of places of worship, monasticorders (not engaged in any form of trade, professionor commerce) would be admitted free of duty.

that such rights should, be registered by the Corn-mission and included in their Report to the Mandatory.IRAK.In view of the fact that the Irak mandate isnot at the present under discussion and that thepolitical conditions in Irak end Palestine are&apos; notexactly similar, the British Government give to theItalian Government the general assurance that so faras the different conditions of Irak will permit, HisMajesty&apos;s Government will ensure that Italian inter-ests in Irak will be safeguarded on similar lines tothose now suggested for Palestine..
