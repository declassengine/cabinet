(This Document is  the Property of His BritannicMajesty&apos;s Government-)SECRET -S-47.MEMORANDUM OP A CONVERSATION HELD IN THELORD PRIVY SEAL&apos;S ROOM, HOUSE OP commons on TUESDAY,  FEBRUARY SI,  1922,  at 4 o.m.*PRESENT:-The Prims Minister.Mr Chamberlain.Mr Balfovlr.Lord Beatty.Sir Maurice Hanksy.NATIONALFCONOMY.THE PRIME MINISTER gave a general explanation tc lord beatty of the present position.    The Geddes Committee had recommended a cut of  21,000,000 In addition to what mightbe obtained as the result of the Washington Conference andfrom further economies in the matter of oil, making a   -total of  38,000,000.    Then the Board of Admiralty, withMr Amery in the Chair, had published their Memorandum.This had given the impression that the Admiralty wereattacking the Geddes Committee, and the Memorandum hadreceived a bad Press.    The Admiralty offered a total of 19,000,000.    Apart from the Washington Conference,theCommittee on National Economy said that the Admiralty couldsave  21,000,000.    The Admiralty maintained that *they couldonly save  7,000,000.    This was only half the total of 14,000,000, which was explained in detail in the Reportof the Geddes Committee.   He felt it would be hopelessfor himself and his colleagues to endeavour to discuss
details with Lord Beatty:    the First Sea Lord would be ableto answer every criticism on technical grounds.    All theycould do was to   make an appeal to him.    They wished toput to him the new proposal, namely, that the question should be viewed from the point of view of-the naval risks to be incurred during the next two years, when a period ofhad trade was expected.    This year there would be a poorreturn from the Income Tax, and next year the same would occur, making two bad years.    He and his colleagues couldnot say to Lord Beatty &quot;You must take the risk&quot;.    He wouldlike, however,  to have the matter stated by Mr Bal four as hehad stated it to the Cabinet.Mr B.flTPOUR said that the substance of what he had sug-gested to the Cabinet was that It was not fair to ask the&apos;Head of the fighting Service not only to makethe cut Jgut tosay that he considered it satisfactory and adequate.    TheGovernment had to choose between the Scylla of financialembarrassment on the one side, and the Charybdis of an unsatisfactory naval position for two years on the other.Which was the best for the country?    So far as the financialside was concerned, he was not sufficiently informed toexpress an opinion.THE PRIME MINISTER said the financial side was as badas it could be.Mr CHAMBERLAIN said that nearly every big concern, and very many individuals, were paying their Income Tax out ofcapital.    Quite apart from the hardship on Individuals,therefore, the resources of the country were being drainedand businesses would tend to peter out, for the reason thatthe money which they ought to use for development wasbeing drained away for taxation.    He spoke as an old Chan-cellor of the Exchequer, who had taken over the financial responsibility from a predecessor who had told him that itwould be worse for Mr Chamberlain than it had been for
himself, and who had handed over to his successor telling him that the situation was still more difficult to deal with.He could not put the financial risk too high.   Moreover,  itwas Immediate.Mr BALFOUR said that if an appeal were made to a super-roan, as it were, from some other sphere, who would treat the question simply as a judge, telling him that we wished the British Empire to he as strong as eireximstances would allow, and asking Mm where the cut should be made, whetherthe Navy was to be reduced below not the limit of national,safety but below what was considered desirable for two-years.Or whether we were to accept a financial position that wouldcrush the country, he thought he could only give one answer.He thought that his reply wotild be that the risk from over-burdening the finances was greater,even from a naval pointof view,  than a very remote chance of naval risk.    The fact was there was no conceivable naval antagonist except Japan,for he really could not consider war with America as possibleduring the next two years.    For the matter of that, war with japan was equally improbable.    In such a case the super-manwould advise a, cut in the Navy, which, he agreed, was anational misfortune, but would only be adopted to avert aworse misfortune.Mr 0HAMBERLAIN added that the future of the Navy depended on getting back1our financial power.    Hence the Navy was asmuch interested in finance as anyone else.    If too great aload were placed on the camel&apos;s back it would break, whereasby going below the standard of naval strength a risk would betaken during the next two years which really was negligible.Moreover, when the financial danger was passed we couldrecover our position.Mr BALFOUR said that the worst case was that the french should start building submarines and that we should have todevelop counter measures.    In that case it would be necessaryto go to the House of Commons and ask for an increase, and
there-would be no difficulty in obtaining it. He thought thatrisk was ranch greater than any risk from America or Japan.THE PRIME MINISTER thought the House of Commons would doit the more readily if they knew the Admiralty had helpedin the time of financial risk.Mr CHAMBERLAIN said he thought it was necessary to makeit clear that they were not meeting Lord Beatty with any terms of reproach.    The Cabinet Committee had told them thatthey could not possibly have recommended the economies theyhad recommended without his most cordial and helpful co-operation.THE PRIME MINISTER associated himself in this.LORD BEATTY recalled that the Prime Minister had referredto the fact that the G-eddes Committee recommended a cut of 21,000,000 exclusive, of Washington.    The Committee, however,had only specified as to how the savings were to be effectedfor  14,000,000, and had left the remainder unspecified.    Ofthose  14,000,000 roughly  7,000,000 were totally impractica-ble if the Government&apos;s policy was to be carried out.   If thewhole of the Geddes proposals were to be carried out tomorrowthey would only amount to  14,000,000.    That was all the suggestions which were in any way practicable, and if theGovernment&apos;s policy of a one-Power standard wa3 to be pursuedonly  7,000,000 was practicable.    The figures he was givingwere only very approximate, and might be less.    If to this were added  18,000,000 saved as the result of the washington conference,  it would give a total of  19,500,000.    He-had stated the above as a preliminary - remark.   He recalled thatbythe Reoort of the Geddes Committee had been examined iskJ&amp;oj aCabinet Committee under Mr Churchill.    It was a very strongCommittee in character, owing to the fact that Mr churchill had occupied the post of First Lord at a time of very greatnational expenditure.    He knew all the channels in which onrtxcuts could be made,  and in Mr Churchill&apos;s period of adminis-tration he had probably obtained a greater value for the-4-
sovereign than any First Lord before or since.    The Admir-alty, therefore, had been scrutinised in the utmost detail and had wade every possible cut-.    They had cut off 15 menhere, and 20 there:    saved  5,000 here and  8,000 there.    he mentioned this to show how fine a sieve they had been passed through.    In regard to Mr BalfourVs suggestion that theAdmiralty and the Navy must take cognizance of the financial situation, he agreed that the Admiralty was as much inter-ested as any other Department.    Hence they had done all theycould to realise economies.    They had taken risks with thefact before their minds that the existence of the Navy depend-ed on the future financial status of the country.    On Fridayevening the Board had received the instructions of the Cabinetto consider the situation en the assumption that risks must be taken during the next two years.    In regard to oil, theyhad already taken risks, with the gravest misgivings.   Theyhad not taken these risks for two years only, but for threeyears.   These risks, which affected the situation in the pacific, were shared fully by the Cabinet Committee.    It wasonly with the greatest misgivings that the Admiralty had beenable to do this.    Now the Prime Minister was asking for alter-native proposals in regard to the personnel of the Fleet.    TheAdmiralty did their best to carry out the policy of the Gov-ernment in the. most economical way they could.   The policy ofthe Government was for a one-Power standard.   This had been endorsed by the Imperial Conference, and had been, the basis0f the Washing on Conference.    It had also been accepted bythe Washington Conference and by the Cabinet when it acceptedthe recommendations of the Washington Conference.   The Admir-alty, therefore, had to consider how this policy could becarried out in the most economical way.    They had made reduction-tions in their personnel from 125,000 men to98,000 men, asthe result of the Washington Conference.   Under the provisionsof the Washington Conference the United States Fleet wasinferior numerically, though equal in strength to the larger
British Fleet.    The British Fleet had been allowed surface ships owing to the fact that it was war-worn.    For thisnumerically larger Fleet the Admiralty was only asking98,000 men, which was 35,000 men below the American figureof 128,000.    He could make nu proposals for reduction unless it was qualified by some change in policy.    If this were done, some reduction might be feasible.    He understood thatIt was only contemplated for two years, but in this case itwas very difficult to make any financial reduction economic-ally which would be of any importance.    Still, if the Gov-ernment said that for two years the policy was to be to reduceand were willing to tell Parliament that it was temporary only,the Admiralty had to consider what, in that case,  the reduc-tion was to be.   He did not think it was possible to reduceany particular percentage and reinstate that percentage twoyears hence economically.    For example, the Geddes Reportsuggested a figure of 85,000 men.  -That meant cutting down an extra 13,000 men, who would have to be got rid of and brought back two years hence.    Already the Admiralty had made a cut0&quot;** S0,oo0. and they were meeting great difficulties in carry-ing that out without impinging on the savings to be effected.They were encouraging free discharges,  and asking men to take their pensions earlier.    They were told they might get rid of14,000 men in that manner.    The disposal of the extra 6,000whowas very difficult.    To add to this^nother 15,000 men/wouldhave to receive gratuities quite apart from unemployment doleswas not economical.    Moreover, in two 3rears&apos; time a bonus wouldbe required to get the men back.THE PRIME MINISTER asked how many recruits were obtainedannually?I ORB BEATTY said the number was about 6,000, but recruitswero taker, as boys.THE PRIME MINISTER remarked that during, the War full-grownmen had been taken, and had proved just, as efficient sailors
as the others, so long as they were under fully trainedo f f 1 e e rs.LORD BRATTY said that many&apos;officers would have to begot rid of; in fact, the saving would have to be spreadthrough ail ranks and ratings. The actual economy to beobtained from that was only from  200,000 to  250,000.THE PRIME MINISTER asked what other economies  could beobtained?LORD BEATTY said the only other economies to be obtainedwere in the dockyards.   He thought the Admiralty could makea further cut of ^4,000 there.    This would mean reducedefficiency, but the Admiralty would accept it.    This would produce perhaps  500,000 gross.    It would involve closing down Pembroke Dock.THE PRIME MINISTER remarked this was the only dockyardon the west coast.LORD BEATTY said that was so, apart from Devoftport.Mr CHAMBERLAIN remarked that Pembroke was a very poorlittle dockyard.LORD BEATTY said the saving on Pembroke would be  150,0(8)gross, but net it would not amount to more than  100,000.&apos;In all the economies relating to  the dockyards the cheapermen had been discharged:    that is to say, those of short service, who wer&amp; not yet entitled to gratuities.    Havinggot rid of 7,000 men already, the next 4,000 would be ona higher scale of service and by their contracts would beentitled to gratuities.   .Not so much economy would be real-is ed from this as in regard to the earlier men.    The  500,000gross would probably come,down to  300,000.   The admiralty had already made some economies and sacrificed a good deal,b\it beyond that the sacrifice became greater and even lesswas achieved.THE PRIME MINISTER said that this would not help much,not to the extent of one-tenth of a penny on Income Tax.Unless the Admiralty could do more than this it would not beo^ much use. -7-
LORD BEATTY said they had already Trade a great effort.Their personnel was 55,000 below that of the United Statesof America, and only 10,000 above that of Japan.THE PRIME MINISTER said there was no real basis of com-parlson.    There was no great reserve of seamen in America.They had not enough men to man their mercantile marine.Here there was a vary great reserve of seamen.   This had enabled us during the War to equip a fleet two or three times the size of the pre-War Fleet.   He had never heard&apos;thatthese men were in any way inferior.    Some of the best work had been, done in drifters, and so forth   of course, undernaval officers.    No other nation had a reserve of this kind.Mr BALF0UR asked whether economies had been made inregard to ships other than capital ships?LORD BEATTY said that Mr Churchill&apos;s Committee had cutdown very much in this respect.    The Foreign Office weredaily clamouring for ships to visit different ports, and theAdmiralty had to refuse.   The Government had supported theAdmiralty in this, tinder the protests of the Foreign Office.For instance, the Foreign Office had asked for the retentionof the South American Squadron, but the Cabinet had refused.Continuing, LORD BEATTY said that the Admiralty had cut down the complements of the ships. Every ship now would, on mobilisation, require men to bring it up to full complement.THT? PRIME MINISTER said that a point had been raised atthe Cabinet as to a certain number of men being surplus to requierements.SIR MAURICE HANKEY, at the Prime Minister&apos;s request,explained that the point made by Sir Robert Home at theCabinet had been that large numbers of men were occupied in Training Establishments on shore, who were surplus tothe personnel employed in manning the Fleet.   The suggestion had been that since the ships only spent a certain numberof days in the year at sea, their programmes could bearranged so that men could be sent from the ships fortraining while those ships were in port.-8-
LORD BEATTY thought this was not a practicable plan.Mr CHAMBFRLAIN asked if 5 per cent, or whatever thepercentage was, of the men in the ships could not be sentashore,while the ships were in harbour,  to the gunnery andtorpedo schools?.LORD BEATTY said that this was done to a certain extentalready, but they could not do it any further.Mr CHAMBERLAIN said that he had understood from Mr Amerythat the Fleet required mere men to man it in time of peacethan in time of war.    As he understood the point made by the geddes Committee, it was that the proportion of men in ancillary ships to the numbers borne in capital ships was now greater than it had been before the War.   He couldunderstand that there might be good, reasons for this,  andthat there might be a flaw in the reasoning of the geddes committee, especially after the Washington Conference, whenthe number of capital ships had been cut down.   The geddes committee also stated, however, that the proportions ashoreto those afloat were greater now than before the War.LORD BEAvTY said that the proportion of men in theBritish Navy afloat was far larger than in the United Statesof America.Mr CHAMBERLAIN said he had understood from Mr Amerythat the proportion afloat was larger than in the Japaneseor American Navies, but he gathered from the Geddes Gom-mittee that there was a larger proportion ashore than had been the case before the War.LORD BEAUTY said he believed the proportion was almost the same as in 1914.    The question had been raised at theChurchill Committee.Mr CHAMBERLAIN said he had obtained a different im-pressionfrom Mr Amery.LORD BEATTY said that this point had already been
examined, and economies &quot;had been made in this direction,though everyone grumbled .THE PRIME MTMIStf^R pointed out that the tax-payer als(grumbled.    If a Labour Ministry came in he thought theywould manage to reduce the numbers.Mr CHAMBERLAIN asked whether the Admiralty had menallotted to mine-sweepers, merchant cruisers,  etc.?,LORD BEATTY said that reserves were allotted for thispurpose mr. CHAMBERLAIN asked Lord Beatty to explain why, outof the  14,000,000 of economies specified in detail bythe Geddes Committee,  they said that  7,000,000 of econ-omies could be mad&apos;3 consistently with the one-Powerstandard, but  7,000,000 could not?    It seemed a very large31 fferenoe       opinion.LORD BEATTY said that  the reduction of personnel to35,000 men accounted for a very large item.Mr CHAMBERLAIN pointed out that it was odd that thesegreat business men should have established so large a gap between their calculations and those of the Admiralty.THE PRIME MINISTER said this was the more remarkableas Sir EriVGeddes had been a particularly efficient FirstLord.LORD BEATTY pointed out that the Fleet had not beeneconomically managed in Sir Eric Geddes*  time.   It hadbeen during war, when there had been no special case for economy.   With 85,000 men it would be impossible to manthe Fleet according to a one-Power standard.
THE Hi IMH MINISTER suggested that the additional men required to man the fleet oould be obtained within 10 days of the outbreak of war0LORD BEATTY said that the numbers were not sufficientefficiency of the British personnel which had enabled theAdmiralty to accept economies already made.     Ehey had only been able to do so because British seamen were better trained.Modern ships were very complicated and almost every man was aabused domestics.     Trie men enlisted during the war, to whom thePrime Minister had referred, were not men who had to man corn-plicated machinery, but had been engaged in less complex tasks.Every man in a man-of-war nowadays had to be very highly trainedTHE PRIME MINISTER suggested that this applied to a greatliner also.     During the war he had heard Admiral Jellicoestrongly argue that the convoy system was impossible becausemerchant seamen could not keep station, yet they had in factdone it perfectly.LORD BEATTY said this depended on the officers-sriakbut he-was speaking of able-bodied seamen, who must now be highly trained.MR. CHAMBEH1ALK asked if there was not much work in a shippwhich was practically unskilled.LORD BEATTY said there was very little.,MR. OHAMBEKBAIJH suggested thstl passing of ammunition,lifting of the shell into the elevators, which transferred itsbo the gun, for example.LORD BEATTY said that even the passing of ammunition was tall done by machinery.     The shell were a potential danger tothe ship and had to be very carefully handled by highly trained men.     Referring to the Prime Minister1s case of the liner,      she said that the crew of the &quot;Aquitania&quot; , which numbered mt^figmdto make up the necessary efficiencyIt was this supericshighly trained individual.
a thousand men included about 800 stewards, probably not a hundred seamen, with perhaps 120 in the engine room.THE Pit MB MINISTER said that the latter,  at any rateallknew/about machinery, since the fuelling was done by oil.LORD BEATTY agreed.At this point SIR GNQRGE BEHAREELL entered.MR. CHAMBERLAIN asked if Sir George Beharrell would tell him exactly what the argument was \which the Geddes Committeehad used.      He thought it was something to the effect that before the war there had been a certain proportion betweencapital ships and non-capital ships and the Committee had found before the Washington Conference that the non-capital ships bore a much larger proportion to the capital shipsthan before the war.SIR GiSDRGiS BEHARRELL said that Mr.Chamberlain had stated the argument correctly.LORD BEATTY said that Groups 2 and 3 included harbourships.      Since the war new classes of ships for anti-submarinework and for mining and counter-mining,,    which to their greatregret the Ravy had not been sufficiently well provided withbefore the war, had entered into the calculation.     these were additional requirements.      He asked if the Committee hadmede any allowance for this?SIR GEORGE BEHARRELL said they had not.      They hadmerely looked at the question broadly and had reduced Groups 2and 3 of the Admiralty plans to proportions which they hadcompared with pre-war.MR. CHAMBERLAIii remarked, therefore, the Committee&apos;s jreport was open to Lord Beatty8s objections.SIR GEORGE BEHARRELL said that if that was to be said,the Committee, no doubt, could make counter objections.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that the Admiralty had come to the conclusion that they could not do with less than 0
98,000 men, whereas the Committee said 86,000.     The Admiral K,pointed out that even if they reduce to 86,000, they wouldhave to pay so much compensation that the actual savings would not be more than 200,000.SIE GEORGE BEHARRELL said that the Committee had assuming-ed that a certain number of men would be got rid of by freedischarge.      It depended on the response to this.     Anyhow,it was an avenue worth trying.LORD BEATTY said that the point was that the admiralty had already had to get rid of 20e000   men.     He regretted thathe offer of free discharge was not being availed of as fully as might be hoped.     These men would have to be brought back in two years8   time.MR. CHAMBEELAIiSl asked what was the argument of the geddes committee regarding the proportions ashore and afloat?SIR GEORGE BEHAEEELL said that the Admiralty arrange- .orients involved a larger proportion being ashore than beforethe war.      The Committee8s idea was that men undergoingcourses of training should be temporarily detached from ships at such time as they were not at sea.LORD BEATTY pointed out that much of the essentialtraining of a man of war was carried out in port.SIR GEORGE BEHARRELL agreed. said that n ever the-less the Committee had felt that there was a large marginthere.      The Committee had been told that no less than 1,400men had been provided as reliefs for men who were sick.LORD BEATTY said that these were men who were sent home from ships.SIR GEORGE BEHARRELL said it was difficult to distin-guish   men sent ho-j^e from hospitalfroni men kept in sick bay.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that the discrepancybetween the Committee and the Admiralty was 14.millions.He would like to find some means of elucidating it.
SIR GEORGE BEHARRELL said that the dockyards were onesource of waste.      The enquiries which the Committee had madewith great care and discretion led them to believe that inthe Royal Dockyards, the output of work was only half of what it was in private dockyards.LORD BEATTY said the Admiralty repudiated this. Hewas not saying that the men in the dockyards did mo re,than70 per cent, of a day&apos;s work, their reason &quot;being that they wanted to avoid their comrades being discharged.THE PRIME MINISTER said that if the dockyards were cutdown  5 per cento the same work could &quot;be got out of them.SIR HEORGE BEHARRELL said that at any rate all the work required could be obtained.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that someone in the Admiralshould be instructed to go into the question with Sir George-^eharrell and ascertain if not more than 4,000 could be discha!&apos;ged from the dockyards.LORD BEATTY said that the Admiralty had already offered a cut of 4,000.SIR GEORGE BEHARRELL said that although piece work was said to be in operation in the dockyards, the Committeersenquiries had led them to believe that it was practicallynegligible and that the vast bulk of the work was done as timework.THE PRIME MINISTER asked Sir George ^eharrell if he was willing to go to the Admiralty on the following day to discuss this question^SIR GEORGE BEHARRELL said that if he did so the final report of the Geddes Committee would not be ready during thepresent week.      They were working to a very close programme.THE PRIME MINISTER asked if the Cabinet would have itVin their handsiSIR GEORGE BEHARRELL said that a proof would be avail-able to the Cabinet on the following day.
THE PRIME MINISTER said he would also like to know what savings eould be made in the Admiralty if a cut weremade to 86,000 men.MB*;CHAMBifiRLAlll added that this estimate snould be madeon tiie assumption that the Government were willing to accept such risks as were involved by the cut.LORD BEATTY said that this would mean reducing the fleetby one-third.     Five battle-ships would have to be laid up.He had been given this estimate just before he left theAdmiralty.     A certain number of cruisers and destroyers wouldalso have to be laid tip.SIR GEORGE BEHARREL1 said that that statement was madeon the assumption that the present policy was to be followed in regard to training.MR. CHAMBEKLAIiJ asked if the complement of ships was notasas large/or larger than pre-war?LORD BEATTY replied that they were certainly as large.9fc He reoalled that many new instruments had to be manned whichhad not existed before the war.MR. OHAilBERLAH asked if there was not a much larger pro-portion of oil-burning ships&apos;?LOAD BEATTY agreed.     He said that nine sets of wirelesshad to be provided for now instead of two.MR. CHAMBERLAIN asked if it was necessary to keep the mall manned.LORD BEATTY said that it was not, but they had to be looked after and that meant some increase.MR.balfour said he recalled that there had been a systemknown as the &quot;nucleus crew system&quot;.saidLOAD BEATTY/that existed still.     He pointed out that th^one-power standard could not be maintained with a reducedfleet.
MR. CHAMBERLAIN remarked that the Geddes Committee oonsisled of practical businessmen0      They might have recommended third-class jtfavy, which the Government could not haveacceptedo     They did not do so.      They differed from theAdmiralty not in regard to policy, but in regard to fact.LORD BEATTY asked if Sir George Beharrell could explainhow the Committee had reached their figure of 86,000 men.Had they cut down turret crews, or torpedo crews, or what?sir GEORGE BEHARRELL said th&amp;s had not been the methodof the committee     They had taken the Admiralty statement for 1922 regarding the numbers of/shipsTfco be maintained andtheir various stages of readiness, and had ilad^^no^^e^^^&apos;&apos; o^^ny-of thefj^uLORD BEATTY asked if they had taken auxiliary craft intoconsiderationsSIR GEORGE BEHARRELL said they had not.      They did notapproach the programme from that point of view.MR.CHAMBEELAIN&apos; said that this meant that the admiralty were maintaining a standard in excess of the srakEEpre-warproportions.      If not, they ought to be able to show that theCommittee was wrong somewhere.THE PRIME MINISTER said he was told that the Americanfiavy cost 70 millions a year, as compared with our  Javy, whichwas to cost 60 millions.      The Americans, however, had 30 to40 per cento more men.     How, therefore, was it that therewas only a difference of 9 millions between the estimates,more especially as the Americans paid higher wages?     Some-where or other our fleet must be more expensive.LORD BEATTY said that fe&amp;s our fleet was numericallylarger than the American though equal as regards efficiency.THE PRIME MINISTER asked that the Admiralty should not
approach this problem in a spirit of people trying to defendsomething, hut of those trying to help the country in a difficulty.LORD BiSATTY agreed in this attitude. He said he hadalready done his best and could do no more without a changeof policy.THE PRIME MlillSTiiH said that Parliament would be varydisappointed if the Admiralty could not get nearer to theestimates of the Committee.     He hoped Sir George Beharrellwould be able to reduce their estimate.SIR GjaQBGiS BiJJBA.iir.MLL remarked that the Committee hadnot taken into a account any consequential increase in unem-ployment benefit which might result from the discharges of seamen and dockyard hands.MR.CHAMBiSRLAIiS agreed that this was correct.     Therewas, however, the question of what compensation had to bepaid. tHxmeE under the contracts, to men discharged.MR. BALFOUH said he could not understand how theAmerican fleet was run on less money proportionately.LORD, BEATTY said that the 98,000 British personneldid the same work as the American 128,000.SIR MAURICE HAJSKKY pointed out that the 128,000 Americaspresumably included Marines.      The United States ^ar in&amp;Corps had, however, two additional functions.   First, athoy hadmen in garrisons and men, like the French Marines, in gsgxadfe-feionies, for example, in Porto Rico, Cuba, Hawaii, Guam,Manila and in expeditionary work in San Domingo, Haiti andAlioaragua. The second was a considerable force was allotted to the advance base force maintained at Quantico.MR. BALFOBB remarked that the American Marines were alsoused to guard trains,IPSIR MAURICE HAHKEY said that these were drawn from the advance base force.
After some further conversation, the meeting closed.It was arranged that Sir George -^eharrell should visit the Admiralty on the following morning at 11 a.in.  in orderto discuss the possibility of reducing the numbers of dock-yard hands and to discuss the savings which could beeffected supposing the personnel of the fleet were reducedto 86,000 men.2,Whitehall Gardens, s.W./l22nd February,1922    s
