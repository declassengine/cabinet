 on the situation. He then read telegram No.2469. He thought it right to tell his colleagues that, subject to certain conditions, the General Staff, he believed, were likely to advise the evacuation of Chanak.

 LORD CURZON, referring to telegram No.2469, said that this seemed to suggest that we were to give the Turks at once what they require to obtain from the conference, and to retire to Callipoli, leaving an advance guard at Chanak.

 MR. CHURCHILL said he understood the position to be that the Cabinet had to some extent staked our prestige on the holding of Chanak. Up to now we had exercised the greatest forbearance in regard to the violation of the neutral zone by the Kemalists, but there had been no hesitation that we should attack them within a few days if they continued to advance, and if fighting occurred, we should respond by calling up reserves and mobilising divisions. New Zealand and Australia were also willing to send troops. In that event we ought to telegraph the dates by which the troops could arrive. The interval was obviously one of great importance. If we were attacked, we ought to make every effort to win. If help, for example, could be obtained from the Greeks, we ought not to reject it. A large portion of the Greek army had not been mauled and might be sufficient for example to hold the European side of the Bosphorus.

 LORD LEE observed that it was undesirable to let the Greeks into Constantinople.

 LORD CURZON observed that surely we could not contemplate a war with Turkey, with the Greeks as our only ally.

 MR. CHAMBERLAIN entered at this point.

 MR. CHURCHILL and LORD CURZON explained the situation to Mr. Chamberlain and gave him telegram No.2469 to read.

 SIR LAMING WORTHINGTON-EVANS, referring to the anticipated advice of the General Staff, said that although he had only had a very short discussion with the Chief of the


 Imperial General Staff and had only had time to skim through their Paper, their advice, he understood, would be based on some such arguments as the following. We could not allow the Turks to proceed as at present for another forty-eight hours. If they refused to retire, this would prove that the cavalry were merely the outposts of a larger force. The Turks would then bring up other forces from outside the neutral zone, which would be permeated by their troops. If they were driven out now by our small force, it would be in the nature of a bluff. On the other hand, they might camp out of range of our guns and wait until they were ready to come forward in a few days&apos; time. The position at Chanak was at present too restricted as the hills outside Chanak and over-looking it were not held. Consequently, it would be difficult to lead and deploy any large force. The first step which General Harington would take would probably be to bring the four battalions in from Constantinople and try to seize the high ground. There were in addition, four battalions as well as the Marines on their way to General Harington&apos;s Command. No-one could tell what the result of a fight might be. The moment a shot was fired it would be necessary to mobilise. The C.I.G.S. would not admit that the position now held at Chanax was a proper brigehead. Moreover, it was within six miles of positions on the straits from which flanking fire could be brought to bear on Chanak and the straits. On his observing that the theory on which Chanak was held appeared to be wrong and that nothing less than a fifteen-mile front, as had already been supposed, was of value, Lord Cavan had agreed. He himself had then said that he had been led to suppose that a larger position was to be held. He thought the first was to get the advise of the General Staff.

 MR. CHURCHILL pointed out that to give up Chanak would be a serious blow to the prestige of the Empire and he


did not know what view the Prime Mimister would take of such a proposal. The only worse blow would be to be driven out.

 LORD CURZON recalled that only about a fortnight before, orders had been given that General Harington was at liberty to evacuate Chanak if he thought necessary and M. Poincare, during his conversations, had constantly taunted him on this.

 At this stage some discussion took place as to the desirability of asking the Prime Minister, who had asked to be warned if this was deemed desirable, to come up from the country, and MR. CHURCHILL telephoned through to the Prime Minister and asked him to come up at once, which the Prime Minister immediately agreed to do.

 As the result of this conversation, the Secretary was instructed to call a Conference of Ministers at 7.0 p.m. the same evening.

 MR. CHAMBERLAIN pointed out that at this stage it did not seem to follow because the cavalry now in the Chanak zone refused to retire without shots being fired, that Mustapha Kemal was definitely preparing to attack Chanak. The troops might conceivably be irregulars, or not under control.

 MR. CHURCHIL did not think either of these hypotheses was likely. It was possible that Mustapha Kemal might be bluffing.

 MR. CHAMBERLAIN said that his second preliminary observation was in regard to the freedom of the Straits. On the whole, military opinion had pressed the importance of holding the Asiatic shore. This being the case, it would seem if the General Staff were now advocating the evacuation of Chanak, that their view had changed. The question to be considered was whether it was now necessary for the Government to commit themselves to steps that would look like a


 renewal of the Great War because the War Office had expressed this opinion.

 MR. CHURCHILL pointed out that all that was suggested was that if we were attacked, the least we could do was to mobalise. He felt it was essential to back up General Harington. He confessed it had been a great shock to him when he had learned that the perimeter at Chanak was only four miles in length instead of fifteen, as had previously been understood, and that the two dominating hills were not in our possession.

 MR. CHAMBERLAIN pointed out that our policy had never been to make a last stand at Chanak, but if compelled to do so, to retire to Gallipoli, holding Chanak as long as possible as an outpost of Gallipoli. Was the step to be taken now to transfer the troops to the Asiatic Shore?

 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR then read the relevant portions of telegram No. 91137 of 20th September, 1922 to General Harington, in which had been set forth the relative importance of the various positions in the area of the straits, pointing out that Gallipoli had come first in importance, Chanak second, as an outpost to Gallipoli, Constantinople third, and Ismid last. He recalled that up to that time the policy had been to held Chanak and Ismid only as rearguard positions. At this first stage it had been assumed that France and Italy would co-operate. The telegram from which he had just read extracts, was the second stage and that was the last order given to General Harington, superseding the earlier orders treating Ismid and Chanak merely as a rearguard. In his last orders it had been pointed out that it would be a moral disaster to lose Chanak. Any soldier would take this as an order to hang on as long as possible. That was no doubt what was in his mind when, in telegram No.2468 he presumed that "policy remains same that I am at all costs to hold Gallipoli sad Chanak."


 MR. CHAMBERLAIN agreed that telegram No. 91137 stated the policy of the Cabinet. Two things had influenced them: first, the desire to differentiate between the Dardenelles on the one hand and Constantinople and Ismid on the other. If we were hustled out of the Dardanelles, our own prestige was mainly affected; if we were driven out of Constantinople and Ismid, the responsibility was shared with France and Italy who had refused to assist to hold them. Prior to the despatch of this telegram it had only been contemplated to hold Chanak as a rearguard. Then the Government had been told that the military importance of Chanak for keeping open the Dardenelles was more important than had previously been assured. If it was alleged that General Harington had been told to hold out at Chanak to the last, he would reply that that was not the Government&apos;s order.

 MR. CHURCHILL observed that if it was now decided to clear out of Chanak, we should become the laughing-stock of the world. The Government would have to be very adequately satisfied that it was unavoidable.

 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR again quoted General Harington&apos;s telegram - "I presure policy remains same that I am at all costs to hold Gallipoli and Chanak" (No.2468).

 LORD CURZON pointed out that the first thing we were working for was that Mustapha Komal should disevow the cavalry which had violated the neutral zone and call them back. Until a reply was received on this subject, the position was uncertain. Every pressure was being put on the Turkish Nationalists by the French to do this. If Mustapha Komal did not do this, or found difficulty in asserting his authority, was it worth while offering, as a condition of withdrawal from Chanak, that the neutral zone on the Asiatic shore should be observed by both parties. He hoped that this stage would not be forgotten. He hoped also that we should not forget the loss of prestige involved, in the Empire and in the world. He had understood


from the Prime Minister&apos;s speech, that we were standing for the freedom of the Straits. Was Chanak essential to that?

 MR. CHAMBERLAIN pointed out that at every stage the military advisers had insisted on the importance of Chanak and had accepted with difficulty, the naval view that the Straits could be kept open without it.

 LORD CURZON pointed out that this had not been the case in the previous March in Paris. The situation was that by holding Chanak we were likely to find ourselves in the position of having to mobilise two divisions, and finding ourselves at war with Turkey and evacuating Constantinople. This was a combination of disasters almost without parallel. The evacuation of Constantinople would mean not only that the Kemalists would cross the Straits, but that no conference could then take place, for the question of Eastern Trace would be settled, since the Greeks could not keep the Turks out.

 MR. CHAMBERLAIN pointed out there was little doubt that the British Government and their allies could have kept the Turks out of Constantinople. Consequently, any disgrace resulting from the occupation of Constantinople would fall on them and not on the British Government. If Constantinople were occupied, the whole Allied policy would fall to the ground and M. Poincare would be the first to feel alarm. The blame, however, could not be put on the British Government.

 At this point it was decided to invite the experts to enter, and to open the more formal Conference.
