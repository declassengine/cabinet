MEMORANDUM OF A MEETING HELD AT 10, DOWNING. ST., LONDON, S.w./1 on MONDAY, FEBRUARY 20th, 1922 at 7.30 p.m.

Present:-

The Rt, Hon. D. Lloyd George, O.M. M.P., British Prime Minister 

Dr. Benes, Prime Minister of Czecho-Slovakia.

Lieut.-Colonel Sir Maurice, G. C. B.

GENOA FRANCE.

(Note: On the same morining at 10.30 a.m. Dr. Benes had handed Sir Maurice Hankey, for communication to the 

Prime Minister, a copy of an aide mémoire, which he had prepared for presentation to M. Poincaré on the following day, and had asked if the Prime Minister had any objection to it.  After consulting the Prime Minister, Sir Maurice HanKey had informed Dr. Benes earlier in the afternoon that the aide mémoire was unacceptable, particularly in its references to Russia. This aide mémoire was the subject of discussion at the meeting here recorded.  A copy is attached in the Appendix).

THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was not sufficient justification of the Conference merely to conclude a general trade agreement with Russia. Great britain had such a trade agreement already and Czecho-Slovakia could have it when she wished. Moreover, the mere existence of a trade agreement would not induce capitalist to lend money to Russia. The City would not be satisfied to lend money unless tne Russian Government:  had been recognised
DR. BENES agreed that credit would not be given in advance of recognition. Even if, however,  the Genoa Conference should decide that the Soviet Government was to be recognised, still the City would not give money.  In any ease, recognition must come before credit. That had always beenn his idea. His plan had been first to establish trading relations, then to state conditions on which recognition could be given. Of course,if the Soviet accepted and the various countries agreed, then the Bolshevists might be recognised at Genoa. He was inclined to think they would accept the conditions. What, he asked, was the use of recognition if the situation in Russla remained as it is to-day.  A simple signature would not be sufficient to change those conditions.   The carrying out of the conditions would have to be proved. Further, he had thought that if the question of  recognition was raised, it would affront many of the States represented at Genoa.

THIS PRIME MINISTER asked which States?

DR. BENES replied some of the neutrals; for example, Holland and, he thought, Switzerland.

THE PRIME MINISTER doubted if Switzerland would be affronted. Holland was not a great industrial country and did not much matter. The countries which mattered were Sweden, and to a lesser extent, Norway, Belgium, Switzerland, Czecho-Slovakia, and perhaps Roumania. Poland would go with France in any case. He felt sure there would be no economic reconstruction in Russia without some Western control over railways and docks. Russia, however, would not grant this without recognition. The moment she was tasked for it, Russia would demand, to be recognised.  He asked, therefore, that recognition
should not &quot;be Tilled out at the outset t     Without suchguarantees as control of railways and ports,, no creditwould be given.-.DB.BJiNiiS said that his view Was that the ultimategoal of recognition could be reached more rapidly by taking the question step by step.     France would be unwilling to move very rapidly, and moreover, he doubted whether the Russians would grant control of railways and ports.THE PRIME MINISTER said that in that event theywottld get no creditDRaBM^S said that, so far as he knew   the Bolshe--vists, and he had spoken with   Rakowsky, they did not want to go to Oannosa&apos;,     Their object was to take a step,forward..      If too much were   attempted, he feared theConference would be a failure.     The only plan was togo step by step-THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that Great britain had had a trade- agreement for many months,  but, the trade:-would not go to Russia unless agents, Consuls andware appointed ,.,,Ambassadors/and&quot;full relations were established.       With-out this they declined to trade.      The terms of theBritish trade agreement had been vory severe and no more could be done on these &quot;lines.      It was not worth goingto Genoa merely to got more trade agreements. -   It wouldbe a great mistake for the Powers to tie their handsbefore they went to Genoa,      Of course,  if the Russiansrefused the conditions;  then the Conference would haveto do the best it could without them.     For example,
 they might restore the exchanges and establish trade in Central Europe. This would not complete reconstruction, but it was something. Without European help he felt sure that Russia would collapse and the Bolshevists with her. He believed European help was absolutely essential to the Bolshevists and that they could not do without it. For this reason he thought the Bolshevists would give any terms that the Western Powers asked. If Lenin came back from Genoa with nothing in his hands, he would be overthrown.

DR. BENES thought it was quite possible that a situation might arise at Genoa when the Bolshevists would say, "We do not want recognition". He would not exclude this possibility.

THE PRIME MINISTER hoped that Dr. Benes would not make up his mind that this was certain. Of course, if control of Russian railways and ports could be obtained without recognition so much the better. His view was that they could not. The British trade agreement was very complete of its kind, yet it was totally insufficiant to give guarantees for trade. The Russians would not recognise their pre-War debts without recognition.


weDr BTCNES said he wanted recognition, but/must prepareEurope for it.   He thought that if the Genoa conference were to fail over, the question of recognition,, recognitionwould take longer to obtain than if there had been no GenoaConference.    As regards the pre-War debts of Russia, hethought that to grant r-cognition in return for their ackncrirsledgrent was too high a price to pay.   He would only paythat price for political concessions In addition.   the recognition of pre-war debts b$ Russia would come the moment that credit was given to her.    He thought greater progress would be made by dividing the questions as he had proposed.;THE PRIME MINISTER said that in that event Genoa would   -accomplish nothing;    it would furnish a mere scrap of papoivAll Dr Benes . said was, - Let us have a Trade Agreement.   It &apos;.would merely be to come back with a piece of paper that could not be cashed at any bank0Dr BENES said the Bolsheviks were very anxious to get a trade Agreement.^HE PRIME MINISTER said in that ease let&apos;.them pay theprice.   If we could get the price we desired now, let ustake it.    If we could not do so, we could not.   Let us,however, obtain as much as we could.   Do net let.ua, at thiustage, say that we will not recognise without obtainingour whole price.   If we were to say,  &quot;Here is a syndicatewith a capital of  25,000.000 which is ready to put yourrailways in order&quot;, it was not unlikely they would pay theprice.Dr BENES asked how Mr Lloyd George would propose toensure that the Bolsheviks would keep to their bargain?evenTHE PRIME MINISTER said that the Russian Government/in-&apos;that case voxild not be the only one that failed in itsengagements,Dr BENRS said there was a difference between theBolsheviks and other Powers, because the engagement theywould be asked to keep would be a fundamental principle of-5-
-international law and justice.    Up to now th-y had&apos; not- keptit.    Only a year ago M, Eras sin had told him that inter-national law was an invention of the bourgeoisie.THE PRIME -MINISTER said he. had- information that unless-the ?olsheiks could p*t help they were lost.   He referred,to a report by Mr Hodgson., the British Agent in Moscow,who was convinced that the Bolsheviks would be compelled tocome to terms.    If Lenin came to Genoa and went back empty-handed,  the Bolsheviks would be lost;    Russia would rebel.Br BENFS said that in any event Lenin would not comehir^Qoi/ to Genoa.?m&apos; FRIW VTNTSf^R said that might be so, but he - would send, a Delegation.    He then read extracts from MrHodgson&apos;a report, and pointed out that in the main, theconditions which &quot;Vr Hodgson proposed &quot;should be obtainedfrom the Bolsheviks were those which Dr Benes- himself pro-posed,   Mr Hodgson also pointed out. that, there was , a.&apos; nationalist feeling growing up in Russia, which was grad-ually overcoming the previous international idea.Dr BENES said this was true.   He said he was afraid, ofother countries that would be represented at Genoa.    he himself desired an agreement with the Bolsheviks, but the. to and- from     . ., trans nor t/*     Cz^cho-Slovakia depended on conditions inother countries that, were not so &quot;far advanced in theirideas,as regards Russia,as his own.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that Great Britain andItaly were prepared for recognition under proper conditions.m. Briand had also been r^ady &quot;^or this.   That provided forthree countries.    He hoped that -czecho-Slovakia would also-&quot;take the same - line.    How,  then,  could other countries standout?    He had some reason to believe that M. Poincare&quot; was ready-&apos;for&apos;a conversation with him, whether&quot; at Calais, Boulcgieor Folkestone.   He thought possibly this might take place(soon.&apos; He &quot;asked, at any rate, that. &quot;Dr- Benes should notrul* out recognition.    If. the Powers w--re satisfied with--N  ,        &apos; -6- &apos;
the conditions -of ^cognition, let-1her,&quot;recognise SovietRussia..   If not, then they would not.    He hoped, however,t^-ey would not eo to G^noa with th*ir minds made up againstrecognition,Dr BENES said he understood Mr Lloyd George wanted themto keep an open mind.   - iTHE PRIME MINISTER replied in the affirmative.   Hethought the proper course would he to say - We will not recognise unless you will agree to such-and-such, conditions:,Dr BENES said he would correct this, point in. his. memgran-dum,THE PRIME MINISTER said the way to put. it. was that wewould not recognise unless satisfied of.certain conditions.Then a decision could be taken when the Powers met the Bol-sheviks .    ^hey mie;ht prove unsatisfactory.Dr B^TNFS said he was rather- sceptical.    He thought, theRussians would also put their conditions.THE PRIME MINISTER said that very likely he would not beable to look at their conditions.   He could not tell until he knew what they were,Dr BENES said that they would put cond it isms, for. payment on account of. the Czecho-Slovakia legionaries.   0 zee ho-Slovakiacould not possibly accept this.   Their legionaries had done agreat Work in Russia and had controlled the whole, machineryof Siberia for a long time.   They were not going to.pay forany damage these men might have done.T^E PRIMP /MINISTER said&quot;neither was Great Britain&quot;Dr BP]\P?S said he saw Mr Lloyd George&apos;s point pf view, andhe would amend his memorandum to show that recognition wouldbe given according as whether the Russians .would accept thepolitical and economic conditions or not. . He asked if Mr  -Lloyd George had.any remarks to make about the remainder ofhis document-?THE- PRIME -MINISTER called attention to clause 8, suggest-ing that-, the non-aggression clause should be passed as aresolution.   He would prefer it to be in the.form of a Treaty,

apjmjixBRAgg AIMS MJfliOIKB PR^PAkSl) BY       BblNJSS FORPftJfiSMTATIOiJ TO M.POIMCAHJE.General principles. f or the organisation pf the GenoaConferenceIn order that the Conference of Genoa is ableto arrive at real results and be truly successful, in solving tne economic and financial problems, considered from a general European point of view, and problems con-corning Russia in particular,  it is generally agreed,  inview of the general political situation, to submit its&quot;organisation to the following principles;-1.      A short postponement,  in all cases to theend of March /between the 25th and 28th/,  shall bedecided upon..2.      The treaties of peace shall not bo discussed,3,      The reparations shall not be discussed,4,      The participation of the Soviet representatives in the Conference does not imply political recognition ofthe Soviet Government.      The procedure to be adopted withregard to the Russian question is to be as follows.; -(a)     After the opening of the Conference aCommittee will be appointed to deal with theRussian economic questions;    this Committee to investigate the conditions under which immed-iate commercial relations with Russia couldbe started (questions of concessions, of.courts of law, of the application of inter-national law, of private property, of public and private debts,  of compensations for des-troyed foreign property, ete*)(b.)      The resolution passed by this Committeewill render possible economic and eonmiorcialarrangements witn Russia which can be concluded,between the different states and Russia inform of commercial treaties or special arrange-mentSc      This will constitute the first step.(c) The
(c)      The principal political conditions snai 1then be determined, the reali3a -.,lon of whichis to lead to a- do-ju-re recognition ofiaissia- .      The he at thing for the practicalrealisation of these conditions, will be tointroduce a certain deity in order that onthe one hand the Russian Government could- give proofs of its sincerity, and on theother hand the States concerned  could make certain that tne engagements entered intoat the Conference nave been kept -5.      The participation of the Little Entente in theCommittee of Allied experts in London is to be solved inan indirect way:    without boina invited, the Dtates ofthe Little Entente, as well as Poland can send their experts to London and take part in the work of the Committee in a semi-official manner.6.      The league of nations will not be able to takethe basic work of the Conference upon itself;    but since,on the other hand,  tne Conference during its session willbe able to touch upon many questions which have already been dealt with by the League, or eventually will be able to passresolutions one execution of. which could easily be handed. over to the permanent organs of tne League, or to    theofInternational Labour. Bureau, tne League/Mat ions will thus be led to participate in the labours of the Conference,!    7...     The results of the work of the economic Committeewill be summed up(and formulated in tne form of a.convent ionor a   rotocol, an it was done at the Conference of Portorpse,toi which all the members of the Conference would adhere&apos;, andwhich they would submit for ratification    to their respec-tive Governments or. Parliaments according to the. constitutionof their respective ..countries,,..-Otherwise, the. Conferencein principle, will formulate the results of its.discussionsonly in the form of recommendations..... ...........8. The nou-
8.      The non-aggression clause shall be passedas a kind oi resolution of the Conference to re-affirm ina solemn manner the v/ill towards a general peace of Europe:.This could eventut11 y prove to bo one of the for--&apos;7t.rd stops towards tne pacification of Europe,  i.e-*-towardsthe preparation of the ground lor a European treaty of guarantee, eventually including Germany,
