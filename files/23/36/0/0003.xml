MEMORANDUM OP A CONVERSATION HELD IN THE PRIME MINISTER&apos;8 ROOM, HOUSE OF COMMONS, on FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 17,1922, AT 11 a.m.

PRESENT :-

The Prinze Minister.

Dr. Benes, Prime Minister of Czecho-Slovakia. 

Sir M.P.A. Hankey.

THE GENOA CONFERENCE

THE PRIME MINISTER informed Dr Benes that an Inter-Departmental Committee had been considering the preparations for the Genoa Conference for some time and had made very considerable progress. He then showed him the Report which had been drawn up by Sir Sydney Chapman&apos;s Committee.

Dr BENES said that through the good offices of Sir Maurice Hankey he had arranged to see Sir Sydney Chapman the same afternoon.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that in that event it was unnecesssary for him to go over the same ground. He would give instructions to Sir Sydney Chapman that he was to show Dr Benes everything he wished to see. Glancing through the papers, he said he gathered that our preparations were in a very advanced state. There was no reason why the French preparations should not be equally advanced, and in that event there seemed no object in postponing the Genoa Conference beyond the original date.

Dr BENES said that in Paris he had seen M. Seydoux, who was well disposed; but after his own interview with M. Poincar√© he had first come to the conclusion that it was
essential that Genoa should be a success.    M. Poincare&apos; was-*n a bad position as regards Genoa for two reasons:    first,because he was unable to carry the whol^ of the Briand policy on this matter;    and, second, because, when in opposition, hehad sr.id things which tied him now.    For this reason it wasvery difficult for him now to make a volte-face.    Dr BENESthought,  therefore,  that it. was very important that GreatBritain should be prepared to move in some measure towardsM. Poincare&apos;, and that he should move some way towards GreatBritain, in order that a bridge might be built for agreement.This was essential to the success of the Conference, and thesuccess of the Conference was essential to Central europe and therefore to his country.*ttt-r pwiMR MINISTER agreed that it was necessary for france to make a move to the left.    He drew attention to a despatchin the &quot;Morning. Post&quot;, according to which some sort of nego-tiations have been opened between the French Government andthe Bolsheviks.Dr BENES said he knew the origin of these negotiations;He knew Skobeleff, who was conducting them.    The fact wasthe French knew that such negotiations were inevitable.Nevertheless, public opinion must be prepared in France asin England.THE PRIM7 MINISTER asked why M..Poincare did not come overcn the Genoa conference for a private talk?   He would show him every Paper/he had.X-1% however, Mifcoinoare Insisted on long reams of Notesand then Lord Otirson had to reply; and then there was arejoinder and a counter-rejoinder, ho means would be found of reaching an agreement.   It would have a very good effecthere if M. - Poincare&apos; would come for an informal talk:    other-wise th^re was a r^al danger of a breach between Great Britainand France.    Opinion here was tending more and more to criticise France, and undoubtedly opinion in France wasgetting-more anti-British..   British opinion was tending tomove towards Germany.   It must be remembered that Great-3-
Britain had never fought&apos; Germany before the War,  and thatthe population was largely Teutonic in its remoter origin.M- Poincare&apos;s policy was driving the British people moreand more in a German direction.   After all, the germans were a great trading people, and so were we.   Prance wasnot.   Trade was life to us, and if we were attacked in our trade and Franc4 stood in its way we should drift towardsother friends.   This was a most dangerous and deplorabletendency.    It was not happening, today, but the, danger wasreal and might develop more rapidly than was thought.Great Britain was a country with considerable wealth,PVen today there were great reserves of wealthy   the sovereign was recovering its value in America^ and thefinancial position was improving.    To put Great Britain -and it had to be remembered that Italy stood with GreatBritain in this       in a position in which we had to dealmainly with Germany and Russia Was very dangerous.   We didnot want, to do this, but M. Poihcare&quot; was driving us towardsit, - he and the people round him.   The Englishman was slow to anger, but once he had taken a line&apos;he was difficult to divert from it 6Dr BENES said that his country was also an industrial and commercial one.    The Exchange there also had risen ascompared with its neighbours,,   His country had the samemarkets and industries as Germariyi   He was therefore ableto understand Mr Lloyd George&apos;9 position very well, owingto the similarity of his own country1 s. posi tlon.   he himself had explained to M. Pbincare that if Genoa cameoff it meant that Germany would have to be admitted to theLeague of Nations.   Therefore he wanted to talk aboutGermany,   As he understood it, the British positiontowards Germany before the War had been very simple, becausit had been an easy matter to trade with Germany,    Hethought that now it would be a long time before tradee
would be possible, owing to the low rate of the Mar*6.Czeeho-Slovakia had its difficulties in trading withGermany for the same reason, but he wished to make a start.It was necessary to prepare a situation in which it wouldbp to the Interest of Gem-any; to alter her present financial policy.    At present Germany wished to be weak financially,so as to be unable to pay reparations ..   The French position was that they had to restore the devastated regions,  andfor this reason must insist on being paid.    He supposed,therefore, that the aim should be to have an agreement whichwould, result in Germany&apos;s paying money to Prance, but whichwould provide at the sarre tim^ a moratorium to Germany soas to enable that country to improve its financial position..Such a policy would have the effect of raising the cost ofproduction in Germany so that other countries would nolonger be unable to compete with her.   A reparations settle-went on some such lines would clarify the position betweenPrance and Germany.    If no such agreement was reached, he felt that Europe would fall to pieces.   Thus it would be-extremely serious if a new orientation of policy resultedin Great Britain gravitating towards Germany and Russiaand Great Britain and Prance no longer being in agreement.As refrji-rtfg reparations, he had an idea as to how it shouldbe settled.   He presumed that in London it was desired totrade with&apos;Germany, but that it was not found possiblebecause the Mark was so low and that it was found,, forthe same reason, that British trade could not compete with.Germans.    That was why two million Englishmen were unero-ployed.    ^e real fundamental reason, therefore, was repara-tionsr   The fact was that&apos;the Germans had adopted a financial policy that deliberately aimed at producing this situation,.As an instance of this he quoted the case of a small jointrailway in Eastern Bohemia, which was used both by Germanyand Czecho-Slovakia....   When a Czecho-Slcvak     train passed over 1+ the cost of a certain freight would be 45 cro-ris;
when a German train passed over it the cost for the samegoods would be only 15 Marks, which was equal to 5 Crowns..THE PRIM* MINISTFR remarked that the Germrme&quot; jruhsidia^d    -their railways..Pr BF.NES said that the tariff system was the cause, andthis was Very dangerous *br Germany&apos;s competitors.    Part ofGermany&apos;s object in doing this was because she saw the pressure that was on her to pay reparations, and she wanted to be as poor as possible.   The policy, therefore, should beto arrange for reparations for France, but for Germany toobtain her interest.    She should be given a certain time inwhich to pay, and at the same time should give immediatesatisfaction to France.   The real problem in fact was tosatisfy the essential needs of France,    The second need wasto give Germany a certain delay for financial reconstruction in order to give her an interest in putting her finance in-a-better posture.   When that was achieved Germany would not bein so Rood a position to complete against countries likeGreat Britain and Czecho-Slovakia.   Further, this policy would produce an agreement between France and Great Britain.Finally, the policy of France and Great Britain in regardto Russia should be gradually brought into line, and repara-tions should be stabilised;   His view was that not only thequestion of Russia but also that of reparations was o^ thefirst importance in the reconstruction of Europe.    If repara-tions were not stabilised there would be a new Conferenceevery three months and great instability and uncertainty.He himself was not opposed to Germany;    in fact, he had told M. Poincare that it was essential he should move to the Leftboth in r^pard to Germany and Russia.THE PRIME MINISTER asked what had been his rnply?Dr BENBS said he thought, that M. Poincare quite wellrealised the whole position, and that it was really, as MrLloyd George had suggested, a question of a -talk between-5-

Poincare quite wellrealised the whole position, and that it was really, as MrLloyd George had suggested, a question of a -talk between
Great Britain and Prance..prims; viwiSf^r said -h* did not want a big formaltalk: .  Just an informal conversation, like the present..Some news of it would, of course, get into the Press,, butthat did not matter..   He would,, if necessary, run over to paris to try and clear up the situation, though it would bemore convenient, in the present Parliamentary situation, ifM. Poihoare could come to England.   He,, however, had now become genuinely afraid of an estrangement with Prance,Moreover, Italy took the sane view as regards Genoa as GreatBritain.   Whoever came into power in Italy was in favour ofthe Genoa Conference,    The late Pope had actually been writinga letter in favour of Genoa at the moment of his death...   Infact, Tfcaly was entirely with Great Britain in this matter.Belgium also was entirely with Great Britain as regardsGenoa, though of course she did not want to quarrel with france.   Belgium was an industrial country which before theWar had sold 60 per cent,, of its produce in Europe, Fhe was,therefore,, even more interested than Great 3ritain, who hadonlv sole about 85 per cent, of her produce in Europe..   Asr^pa^ds reparations, this was a matter Which the Genoa Con-ferenc--&apos; could not possibly discuss i.   It was a matter to besettled between the nations interested, and he did not wishthe neutral countries which would be represented at Genoato touch it..   The object of Genoa was to deal with economic!and tra.de questions..   Above all, however, it was necessary tohave peace,   ^he only political question was how to securepeace as an essential to trade.   He had seen it suggested inthe &quot;Temps&quot; that there should be trade centres for the western powers in Archangel,. Petrograd, Odessa and elsewhere..   HowC0Uld, they have these, however, unless there was peace?    TheRussians would not allow j.* unless they were recognised.that was why&apos; he vHshed to talk to M. poincare-e..   He hadabsolutely no desire to upset the Treaty of Versailles or any-6-
o*&quot; the other Treaties .    In fact-, in the Press Notice regarciris the Genoa Confer &quot;-nee the following words had been used:&quot;Among the essential objects of the conference will be the consideration of the practical measures required to give effect to these principles, and, in particular, to secure,without injury to the provlsions , of existing.Treaties, the essential, conditions for theesTiablishtnent of confidence between nationswithout which international commerce cannotrevive.   DR. BtidJo said n-e wished once more to revert to his conversation with M*;?oincare .     He thought that M*poincare&apos;was at bottom anxious to come to an agreement with GreatBritain, but he had to consider tne evolution of french public opinion.     The present Chamber was difficult todeal with, though he felt sure tnat it-would changeat the next election.     On consideration, he had come tothe conclusion that it would ne necessar7/ to find someplan midway between the British and the French positions,which McPoincar  could accept.     J&amp;.Seydoux had accentedall that he himself had said in regard to the necessityfor trade with Russia, particularly in order to avert theisolation of Prance,      It would be very difficult forCzecho-Slovakia and Central Europe if the difference be-tween Great Britain and Prance was not cleared up0THE PRIME MlAlSfJbiii remarked tnat Mo Take Jonescuhad suid exactly the same thing.      It was difficult forRoumania to associate herself definitely with Pranceagainst England, or with England against Prance.      However,it would be still more formidable if Russia, Germany andGreat Britain came together.     The present position wasone of great potential danger.     The British Labour party was definitely anti-French.     He did not think that thelabour Party was strong enough to win an election,  it its strength was undoubtedly-Shoreasing.     The old Liberal
Party was also anti-French.     kord Grey had tried to &quot;bring it &quot;back to a more sympathetic feeling towards France, tuthis Party had definitely repudiated this.     Consequently,two powerful sections of British opinion were openlyopposed to France.     The  arty &quot;behind him was the only onewhich a/still stood by France and McSoineare was doing his best toalienate even this opinion.DB.c BJSNSS said he supposed France was beginning torealise this a little.I35ta P&amp;lMiS MIHI3TJSR said that the French Governmentwas too apt tc take its views solely from &quot;The Times&quot; and&quot;The Morning Post&quot;.     These organs did not represent popularopinion, least of all, working class opinion, which was becoming anti-French.      If the working classes definitelywent against France, nothing could resist them*DBaBKBifjS said that his country was in the same stateof politioal evolution.     At the present time, 45 per cent*sf the electors were Socialists.THiS PR BUS MUSISJDMa thought that this was a largerpercentage than existed&apos; in Great Britain, but he admitted that it was difficult to judge.DReBiflUiaS said his country had the same industrial andeconomic questions-as Great Britain.     Before the war,Germany had - occupied 43 per cent, of Cged3ao-Sio&quot;^akiaf simport trade and had taken 41 per cent, of her exports.The country therefore depended to a great extent on german trade.     Thus,.it was in their interests to bring France andGermany together.     The principal opposing influenoe wasthe fear of the resuscitation of the military party inGermany and this rendered necessary some guarantees againstGermany.

Thus^ it was in their interests to bring Prance andGermany together,.     The principal opposing influence wasthe fear of the resuscitation of the military party inGermany and this rendered necessary some guarantees againstGermany.     Conseou ently, he had been very interested inthe proposed Treaty of guarantee between Great Britain and
Prance,     He was not In favour oi- a German ox^ient&amp;tionof his country1 s policy, but he realised that it wasnecessary to have some system of guarantees in which germany would participate.     If Prance became isolatedit would be a terrible thing for her, and it would divide   .Eastern Europe   and there would be a real danger from GermanyConsequently, he was in favour of a general economic policyin which Great Britain, Prance and Italy, as well as Germanyand Russia should participate.     Prance must be brought torealise the importance of not becoming isolated.      Thesame applied to Poland who would be liable to be crushedbetween Germany and Russia.      If war broke out between germany and Russia, his country would be liable to becrushed also.     What he desired, therefore, was an agree-ment between Great Britain and France, * in order to preventthe adoption of any foclish policy on the Continent.     Thatwas why he was so strongly in favour of good relationsbetween Great Britain and Prance.     He was not in the leasthostile to Poland and had made many agreements with thatcountry.,     He thought, ho?,rever, that if Prance was inclined to adopt a foolish policy in Europe she could only be checked by Great Britain.     Hence an agreement between france and  Great Britain was absolutely necessary.      This was theresult he noped for from the Genoa Conference.THE PRIME MINISTER said that if M.Poincare   persisted in this continuous exchange of despatches, no agreement coxtldbe reached.     The Quai dlOrsay was in the habit of givingits despatches to the Press.     When Lord Curzon answered,his replies were also given to the Press or were allowed toleak out..     Then the newspapers in both countries took sides and a great controversy arose0     There was already a greatbelief that the French wanted to wreck the Genoa Conference.If it did so it would wreck the Entente.     Mt.Poinca.re was
now wanting Lord Curzon to write him another despatch. If this continued, a state of opinion would he created in this country in which it would be impossible to carry the proposed pact of Guarantee. He recalled that in 1919 he had carried the guarantee signed by President Wilson and himself through the House of Commons without a division, but this would not by any means be the case in the present inoident if the exchange of despatches continued. His suggestion would be that Dr. Benes should see M. Poincar√© and talk plainly to him. It was impossible to get questions of this kind settled merely by Ambassadors and he thought it very important that he and M. Poincar√© should meet.

DR. BENES fully agreed in this. He said that the numerous Treaties he had concluded with his neighbours had all been reached by personal negotiation between Ministers. THE PRIME MINISTER said his desire was that he and M. Poincar√© should have a meeting. He did not want this to take place in the limelight of extreme publicity but  somewhat informally on the lines of his conversation with Dr. Benes. He would prefer that it took place in London, but if this was impossible for M. Poincar√© he would be prepared to go to Paris for a short visit. If M. Poincar√© could not possibly come himself, let him send some Minister he trusted such as M. Barthou or M. Lasteryric. This was better than any exchange of Notes, the continuance of which he would not agree to. He wanted to know definitely whether France was with Great Britain or against her. He suggested that Dr. Benes should put all this to M.Poincar√©. He should insist that if M. Poincar√© could not come himself, he should send a trusted colleague. The conversation should be purely informal. He would be prepared to show M. Poincar√© or his representative.
efe^ything that the British Government proposed for Genoa.Thon tho whole situation might be cleared up...    If the genoa Conference could not take place on.March 8th, itmast be soon after.     fie could not see any reason why theoriginal date should not be adhered to.BRoBENES asked if it could not be postponed until april,TEE PRIME MINISTER said that it should not be later than the last week in March,DR,BENES said he wished to raise the question of the relation of the League of Nations to Genoa.     He was not asking that the Genoa Conference should be placed entirely in the hands of the league of Nations.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that if this was done,Soviet Russia would nevor attend the Conference.     TheRussians had an idea that Poland ran the league of nations and they were very suspicious of the Poles,DRsBENES asked if it would not be possible to make a division of the subjects to be considered at 6enoa and toallow the League of Nations to be associated with certainparticular questions^     For example, could not the executionof the deoisions in regard to Centra! European questionsbe remitted to the Leagues such as questions of the exchange and assistance to Austria, which had already been dealt withby the Financial Committee of the League of Nations,THE PRIME MINISTER said he had no objection so longas the questions did not affect countries which were not members of the League.       For example, unless Germany was admitted to the league, questions affecting her would haveto be kept away from the League of Nations,     The same appliedto Russian     If, however, Russia and Germany were admitted to the League, he would be prepared to leave all the questions affecting them to the League,
DRaBiDNES thought it essential that Germany should, he admitted this year to the League.     He thought that germany would have no objection to certain questions being leftto the league to deal with.THE PKME MI BIS Ilia said that the United States would never participate in the Genoa decisions if they were left in.the hands of the League of Nations.     If a good scnemefor the reconstruction of Europe was reached at Genoa, hethought that the United States would be anxious to partiei-pate, but if the scheme was left in the hands of the Leagueof Nations, this would not be the case;     The present government of the United States had won the election byopposition to the League, and consequently could not parti-participate in any international business Undertaken by theLeague.      The arrangements for reconstituting Eastern europe would have tt? be in the hands of a special Committee ofbusiness-men who could supply the money - bankers, indus-industrialists, etc.     He could not advise his Government to devote money unless such people were included.DH^HENES said he only contemplated secondary questionsbeing remitted to the League...THE PRIME MINISTER said that a short time agoMoAlbert Thomas had come to see him and asked if the LabourBureau could not be utilised at Genoa.     He had told him that if this were done, America would not come in.-    Hehad suggested that M.Thomas should make his preparationsas though/bhe Bureau was to be employed, and should come toGenoa..     It was very important, however, not to exclude-American participation by relying on the League of Nations, -e repeated that the Russians   were very anxious that thePoles should have no control ef Russia.      They thoughtthat the Poles had great influence in the League of Nations
s^L-^iiOJPQ^oirs they were suspioious of the League.$B*BEiiBS agreed that in these circumstances it wouldnot do for Russian questions to be left to the League orquestions relating to nations which were outside the League,He thought, however, that the execution of some secondaryquestions might be left to the leaguecTB&amp; PRIMS MINISTER said that he would have no objectionto this provided that ^ermany agreed as regards questions affecting her,DR. BENES then raised the question of the postponement of the Genoa Conference.     He said he was going shortly to Italy,     Some questions had ax-isen for settlement in con-nection with the ex-Emperor.  Karlrs pmtsoiu     In reply tothe Prime Minister he said there was no danger cf a furtherputsch.     The previous attempt had been childish, but ithad had a good result in helping to consolidate his ownState.     He had a good deal to settle with Italy,     After-wards he wished to visit the countries of the Little  Entente,Yugo-Slavia and Roumania, in order to surmount some of their objections to the ^enoa Conference.     Consequently, hewould not be bach in Prague before the last weak in February.He hoped, therefore, that there would not be any objectionto some postponementeThe PRIME MINISTER said it must not be beyond the lastweek in March.     There was a great deal of unemployment inGreat Britain.      Two millions of people were on the brinkof starvation and had only boon saved from it by government assistance..     He could not postpone anything which might help to restore trade   because of MuPoincarers objections.The feeling would soon be such that there would be an absolute loathing of Prance among the working classes,     Theywould think that it was Prance who was standing in the waj;of a trade, revival,
DR. BENES said he was convinced that much depended on the stabilisation of reparations. 

THE PRIME MINISTER said that this was a question between France and Great Britain and other interested Powers. He suggested that Dr. Benes should see M. Poincar√© and repeat to him all that he himself had said.He should then ask M. Poincar√© if he was willing to meet him informally. He wished the meeting to take place in London, but if absolutely necessary, he would go to Paris for twenty-four hours, though it would be difficult in the present Parliamentary situation. If M. Poincar√© thought it would be better that he should not come himself, Dr. Benes should suggest that he should send some trusted, colleague. He thought there might be advantages if Dr. Benes himself could be present at the conversation. He would be very glad if he would come back to London with M. Poincar√© and be prepared to explain his own views about the position in Central Europe. If, however, M. Poincar√© thought it better to come alone, then Dr. Benes would act accordingly.

DR. BENES said he was entirely at  Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s disposal in this matter.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that M. Poincar√© had proposed that the experts of the Eastern European States should come to London. Except for Czecho-Slovakia, however, the countries of Eastern Europe could not make any great contribution. He did not think they had studied the question deeply and Czecho-Slovakia was the only industrial country among them. Moreover, if the Eastern European States came, it would be difficult to exclude the Scandinavian States. The Swedes in particular, had a very great economic expert, and then there was M. Termoulen., who in that event, ought also to be invited. What would be possible would be for France and Great Britain to go to
Genoa a day or two beforehand to discuss some of the questions in advance. The real difficulties were not those of experts, but political in character. He and M. Poincar√© would have to clear those up. Then the experts might get to work with some success. Experts could always agree if there was a political agreement. The first thing was an informal conversation in order to reach a political understanding.

DR BENES said that it was known in France that he was not only a great friend of France, but also grateful in a high degree for what Great Britain had done for Czecho-Slovakia at the Peace Conference. They knew also that he was earnestly desirous of peace in Europe and that he feared for France.

THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that France had also alienated opinion in America. There was an opinion there that France was militarist and desired the hegemony in Europe. The same feeling was growing up in Great Britain. France was alienating the whole of opinion in Europe by her action.

DR. BENES said that he thought that France was really beginning to feel this, although they were not fully conscious of it yet. They did many stupid things which created a very bad impression. His President had pointed out that France was rapidly becoming isolated, He intended to all this to M. Poinoar√© and to try for a meeting as the only way of bringing Great Britain and France together.

THE PRIME MINISTER said he was certain it was the only way. Despatches would only lead,as he had said, to a Press controversy which would make agreement impossible.

DR. BENES said he was leaving England on Sunday.

THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that he should repeat in the friendliest way to M. Poincar√© the gist of this conversation. He might remind M. Poincar√© that he (Mr. Lloyd George)
was a very old friend of France. He and M. Labouchere had made the only speeches in favour of France at the time of the Fashoda incident. He had been a follower of Gladstone who had been a great friend of France, although he was dead before the Fashoda incident. In fact, he himself had been made a friend of France all through, but he wanted peace in Europe and if France was not in favour of peace, he would have to go his own way. That was why he wanted to see M. Poincar√©. It was much better that he should see him informally and he would be very glad if Dr. Benes could bring this about, but if M. Poincar√© objected, he should press him to send a trusted colleague.

DR. BENES said his services were entirely at Mr.Lloyd George&apos;s disposal for this purpose.
