At therequest of the Erench the Report had been drafted by theBelgian Delegation, and he did not feel that it was a very satisfactory document. -&apos;THE PRIME MINISTER said that- M. Poincare had expressed a good deal of dissatisfaction with the Report.    He hadtaken the various recommendations and had condemned all ofthem in turn.   The first two he &quot;said were merely a repetitive-tion o-&quot; what was already being done, the next pair of recommendations was vague, and so &quot;forth.      THE PRIME &quot;MINES TEIthen gave an account of a three-hours Conversation he had had with My Poincare&apos; and M. Theunis that morning.    It was,of course, impossible for him. to recount all that had-1-
- Happened in such&apos; a long Corners at ion, ; He had -thereforeashed that M. Gamarlynck, the&apos;Interpreter, might send, afull note of the Conversation.  &apos;M. Poinoar^. had -ratherdemurred at firs-t^ hut had eventually consented. &quot;-&quot;In the&quot;course of the &quot;Conversation M, Theunis had. made what wasin the-nature &quot;of an emotional appeal to M. Poincara&apos;, atthe end of which ha had -almost broken down.    He hadreferrd to what an indescribable catastrophe to humanityit would he if the Entente broke down after the immensesacrifices of the War.    M. Poincare had not responded-tothis appeal in the very least.    Pie said that all this had been tried at Spa and at London, and so forth, andnothing had aver coTe out of It all.   The Prime minister himself had challenged M. -&quot;Poincare on this point, and...hadreminded him that - the Spa Conference had resulted inmillions o^ tons of Coal being handed&apos;over by the Germans,as well as other deliveries in&quot;kind.   The London Confer-ance, he had pointed out, had resulted &quot;not merely indeliveries in kind but in actual gold.   He had pointedout it was &apos;useless&apos;to make&apos;statements of that kind.-M. Poincare&apos; had spoken of a rupture,   He himself had replied that ML Poincare seemed to talk quite calmly ofa rupture and he could hot understand- how he could do soafter the sacrifice of&quot; millions of lives in the War.    Hehad further pointed out&apos; that the rupture was to-take placemerely for a few million German paper Marks,    The Allieswere in agreement oh&apos;everything which would&quot;produce actualcash.   He had thought that - M. poincare&apos;was just a littlestaggered at &quot;this .--&apos;Mr&quot; Lloyd George&apos; hiimself had than saidthat he did&apos;not pretend te -know the state of public opinion in Prance, which&apos;-might:be behind- M. Poincare at the moment.Six months hence, however, when it-was discovered thatthe only result&apos; was- paper-Marks,&apos; Prench public opinion would&apos; see things differently.-   In -the&apos;- end- M.--&quot;Poincare -had
said that ha crust consult his coil&apos;&quot;:agues .   Mr Lloyd Georgehad ashed him if this meant going bach to Paris, and hehad replied that it did nott   he could consult them from london.    He himself had said that he would have to consulton the ratter with his colleagues, and he thought it wouldbe necessary to Simmon the Cabinet.-   THE LORD PRIVY SEAL suggested that a Cabinet meeting should be summoned by telegram.THE PRIME MINISTER, continuing, said that K. Thaunishad been quite, first-rate at the Conversation that morning.Ho had shown that all M, Poincare&apos;s proposals, if not adopted nov/, could be held in reserves as, so to speak, asecond line of attack.    If the Germans did not respond towhat was done now, M. Poincare^s roe-astires could be adopted as means of coercion:    for example, the control of the..Customs,  the exploitation of.-the forests,  and so forth.Mr Lloyd George had then- pointed, out that the London pro-posals, such as the 26 per cent, on Customs and. the Repara-tione Recovery Act, had - produced actual gold.   M. Poincare&apos;had been rather surprised--at this.   Mi- Lloyd George had then pointed out that the Reparations. Recovery Act wasproducing.100,000,000 gold Marks a year, and he had asked why Franca and Belgium were getting nothing.   Ha had sug-gested that bvrbre measures were adopted .to produce morepaper Marks, the existing plan should he put into operatiai.M. Poiiieare, had then suggested that the British ware pri-vileged.   He himself had replied that this was not the case,that the decision was available for all the Allies, onlyPrance, and Belgium had not put it in operation,   M. Poincarethen suggested that, the Germans&apos; played fair for the Britishbut would not do so for the other Allies.    Eventually &apos; &quot;M. Poincare&apos; had agreed to r-v^ar the question to the Experts,vis., as to why the Reparations Recover;/ Act had produced
100,000,000 gold Marks for Great Britain, which was equivalent to nearly 350,000,000 francs.   After themeeting he had driven away with M. Tbeunis,  and they had discussed the desirability of putting the British and belgian proposals in writing, together with what theseproposals would produce.THE CHANCELLOR 0? THE EXCHEQUER pointed out that thesystem in operation produced  70,000,000 a year,, butthat the Germans now said that-if continued it would mean a financial collapse, and had asked for a moratorium,M. Poincard&apos;s attitude was that he would agree to abut-onlymoratorium/on conditions which would bleed germany in another way.   This appeared very illogical.THE PRIME MINISTER tho\ight that, subject to the mora-sanatorium, a Memorandum should be put forward showing how much our proposals would produce.    This woiild make itharder for M. Poinearth to effect a rupture, particular^as he himself had told M. Poincare&apos;&apos; that six months hence the Ereneh proposals, if adopted, would produce nothing but paper.(At this point there was some discussion on thevalue of paper Marks if converted into foreign currency immediately they wore redeived.    Duringthis discussion Sir&quot; L. Worthingtoh Evans entered.)TRe PRIME minister &quot;R suggested that it would be useful to prepare a Memorandum setting forth the British pro-posals in regard to reparations..THE-LORD PRIVY SEAL stated the British position asfollows:-   The sum which Germany could pay for foreignreparations was the difference between German exports andGerman imports, reduced to the lowest possible minimum.a percentageThat could be presented in the form of Jfesc K^ESsgs&quot;on german exports.   What that percentage should be was amatter for Experts to decide.THE PRIME MINISTER said that M. Poincaref was willingto accept 26 per cent.
SIR H. WORTKINGTON -EVANS: said -that 26 per cent, was morethan the difference&quot;to Which Mr Chamberlain had referred.He quite agreed with Mr : chamberlain s statement of theBritish case.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE-EXCHEQUER- said that  500,000,000of exports before the War had enabled Germany to investabout  50,000,000 a year.   He had investigated the matterrecently, and previous estimates On the subject wes?eincorrect.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL, continuing, said that this couldbe stated as a percentage on exports, and it should besomebody&apos;s business to find out what this percentage shouldbe.    It appeared to him that, under the Treaty, the Repara-tion Commission was the px-oper bod.y to fix the percentage.If that percentage Could be obtained^ and if his premisewas correct that that was all that could be obtained,  itwould be the best method available.   Was there in fact abetter plan than that adopted in the London Agreement,whereby the trader paid over his percentage to the ReichBank in foreign currency or its equivalent, and the ReichBank handed the proceeds over to the Committee of Guarantees.was there any plan so simple or so easy to put in operation?THE CHANCELLOR CP THE EXCHEQUER said that this system -had been adopted, though its full operation had been checkedas the result of the Cannes meeting.THE LORD PRXVY SEAL said that if M. Peincare&apos; acceptedthe premise he did not see how he could avoid the conclu-sion.THE PRIME MINISTER said that M. Poincare was not in themood to accept anything.   He thought the first point wasto decide whether to summon the Cabinet.    He was particular!;anxious that -Lord- Cur son should be present, if possible,and he instructed Sir Maurice Hankey to send a communication to Lord Cur son saying that, if his health permitted,he
attached importance &quot;to nds&apos; &quot;be-in r prestmt&apos;; - sdnc^T-vitalquestions of foreign policy were raised.    He also thoughtit important that Mr Churchill, who, he understood, was in france,  should be present.SIR MAURICE RAFKEY pointed out that this involved tele-grams ejn clair..THE LORD PRIVY SEAL thought then was no objection tosending the proposed telegram   en. clair to Lord Ourzonunder present conditions .THE PRIME MINISTER said the next point was that he wouMiike the Chancellor o * the Exchequer to ask Sir Basil Blackettto produce a Memo andurn showing the British plan.(At this point there was some discussion on allied Debts and the amounts, that would be  -remitted under the Balfour Note.)mHE LORD PRIVY&apos; SEAL suggested that It the Prime minister asked M, Theunis to write a Paper h^ should suggest that heshould begin by pointing out that all&apos; wore agreed thatGermany must pay what she could, though they were not agreed on the question of when and how the payment should be made,and before there was any question of a, rupture they oughtto consider seriously whether any of the new methods proposed would produce more than existing methods,THE PRIME MINISTER said he would speak to M. Theunis about this at lunch.   He thought that if agreement could be reached as to the proposals,  the best plan would be to treat them asinstructions to be given by each Govern- ant to its represent-ative on the Ree-aretion Commission.    The alternative plan,which would probably be the quicker one, would be to sendfor Dr. VTirth and cof runic at el the proposals to him, but hef-lt sure M. Poincare&apos; would never agree to this. If, however,the proposals were made to the Gorman Government by theReparation Commission and distmssed by them with the repre-sentatives of the Gexmari Government,, the Reparations Cowmis-.sion could report that some of the proposals would not work,and a fresh Conference could be held.
THE CHANCELLOR OP THE BXCHEOUER pointed out that theCommittee of Guarantees had done this scoe time ago.Though their Report had not been received, he had receiveda cor:imunication regarding th-ir conclusions.TH&quot; PRIME MINISTER said he would like to have a copy.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said he would ask MrLeith-Ross to- write down -vhat the conclusions were.The Conference agreed --(a) That the Cabinet should be surrioned for p.b. on the afternoon of Thursday,August 10, 1922, and that Lord Curzonshould bo asked to r-also a point ofattending if his health permitted:(b) That th&quot; Chancellor of the exchequer should instruct Sir Basil Plackett toprepare a M-moranduni setting -forth theBritish, proposals and their financial effect:(c) &quot;hat the Chancellor of the exchequer should send the Prime Minister a summaryof the conclusions of the Committee of guarantees.Whitehall Gardens, S.&quot; .1,August 9, 1922.
