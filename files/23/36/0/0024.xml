A^JC^ -207Memorandum by Mr,Obamberlain of a. conversation withthe Roumanian Charge&apos; d&quot;Affaires, Monday 18th September,1982 at 3.30 ,p.m, fWhile I was in conference with Ministers this morning theRoumanian Charge d&apos;Affaires telephoned to me for an interview,    I received, him at 3.30,   He told me that after his interview with thePrime Minister and myself on Saturday, and thanks to the telgraphiofacilities arranged by the Foreign Office^ he had got his messagethrough in the course of that night to Bucharest but much of it had arrived eo mutilated that he had been asked to repeat it,   Bucharesthad now received the repetition - he hoped in correct form since nofurther enquiry had come through, but under the circumstances he was still without a reply.     He gave me an account of the message whichhe had sent which appeared as I listened to it to include in substancewhat the Prime Minister had said to him but to contain also a little of his own - indeed he said that he had somewhat exaggerated the account we had given of the menacing attitude of the Bulgarian bands.He then said that he was in a personal difficulty which he wished to mention to me and of which he had. already spoken to theForeign Office.     The French Secretary, with whom he was on intimatepersonal&apos; terms, had telephoned to ask him whether the BritishGovernment had approached him.   Hot knowing whether we should wish thematter to be known, he had denied that we had made any communication to him.   The French Secretary had then asked whether we had made any communication at Bucharest and he had replied that he did not know.
He had mentioned this to the Foreign Office who told him that lord curzon was going to 3ee the French. Secretary this afternoon end had promised to let him know if Lord Curzon thought it expedient to mention our communications to Roumanian so that he might then puthimself straight with his French friend hy some suitable excuse whichhe would invent for his silence of the morning.He again, and spontaneously, dwelt upon the vitalinterest of Roumania in the matter end. of his personal conviction that Roumania would be ready to co-operate,I oal Heebie attention to the response of the Empireand I remarked that in the matter of the Straits the interests ofthe British Empire and. Roumania were the same.   He developed &quot;fillstheme and added that Poland also was interested as they had pointed,out to the Polish Government, for should. Ba^ntzig   at any time be closed Poland could only find an outlet for her exports throughRoumania,    In this connection he desired to draw my attention tothe immense importance which the Roumanian Government attached tdbeing limitroph with Poland and to the hearing of this consideration on the settlement of the Eastern Galioian problem.   He knew theBritish Government had at one time taken a different view aboutEastern Galicia in their anxiety for the protection of minorities,but he trusted that they would consider whether the vital interestof Roumania in being directly contiguous to Poland, taken inconnection with the subject which we had in discussion, did not out-weigh these secondary considerations,I excusedjbyself from discussing this question as towhich I admitted I was ill-informed, but said that I should bearin mind the importance which he attached to the subject,He begged me to draw the Prime Minister&apos;s attenton tothis point,
