He gathered that the FrenchGovernment,, rather wished as to pat pressure upon Saraaay-.This,, however, waulo. place us in a difficult position vis-Hp-via France.   It would enable French public opinion to repeat the charge, so often made, that we ware deprivingFrance of her reparations.iSIR JOfSM BRAOTJRY said that no-one at present knew ahaiifi, Poincare thought on the matter.   Ife himself had not seenPaineare ranch lately.   Hie line he ha4 adopted fcisaaalf%hat i* tafl        the French delegates to make practicalproposals in regard to &apos;the German Note.   The French delegates-1-
had then considered the matter for two days, at the end of which M. Dubois had returned and said he had no practical proposals to make.

THE PRIME MINISTER said it was obvious they were trying to throw the initiative on to us. He asked whether in fact anything could be done to save Germany. At the present time Germany was exporting only a small proportion of her pre-war exports. The French experts said it was 40 per cent; Dr. Rathenau, at Genoa, had said it was 25 per cent. Anyhow, it was some relatively small percentage. On the other hand, Germany was compelled to buy more food than before the War, as well as the necessary raw materials for her manufactures.

SIR ROBERT KINDERSLEY said that the Germans possessed balances abroad. If the prospects were brighter in Germany the people might bring these balances back. As a guess, he thought that the Germans might possess credits of £200,000,000 abroad.

SIR JOHN BRADBURY said that any figure must be a guess, £250,000,000 would be an outside estimate.

SIR ROBERT KINDERSLEY, in reply to the Prime Minister, said that the Germans sold abroad but did not bring back more of the credits so built up than they could help.

THE PRIME MINISTER asked if the Germans were investing in foreign securities?

SIR ROBERT KINDERSLEY said they were, and he had evidence of the fact. It was only natural that persons possessing property should do so in the present unstable condition of the Mark. The moment the Mark could be stabilised the capital would come back.

THE PRIME MINISTER asked how the Mark could be stabilised?

SIR ROBERT KINDERSLEY said that if this could be done a situation would be reached in which an internal loan could be raised in Germany.


THE PRIME MINISTER said he could not see how the Mark could be stabilised,  since the Germans had to buy so much food abroad.

SIR ROBERT KINDERSLEY said that if the Germans could borrow abroad they could get credit.

THE PRIME MINISTER remarked that there were only two conditions for borrowing abroad. The first condition depended on the gullibility of the world, - but that was pretty well exhausted so far as Germany was concerned. The second condition was, to establish  conditions of credit, - but he did not see how this was to be done.

SIR ROBERT HORNE thought an attempt ought to be made.

THE PRIME MINISTER said we had made the attempt in the case of Austria, but it had proved to be merely flinging money into an abyss. He thought it might be better to touch bottom before trying to build up again. Suppose it were possible for the French to say to the Germans, "We forgive you your trespasses", and for us to do the same, - which would be somewhat easier than in the case of France. Then something might be done. At present, however, it was an impossible policy. Still, if it could be done and the debt could be reduced to, say,       £2,000,000,000, divided between the Allies, then something wight be done, though even then he was rather doubtful as to whether German credit could he restored.   There was the psychological factor that no-one cared to entertain German commercial travellers or buy German goods. What, he asked, would be the condition in England if we ourselves were reduced to exporting 25 per cent, of our pre-war exports?

SIR JOHN BRADBURY thought the German exports were not as bad as that. There was probably under-valuation and some ? of exports. However, the Guarantee Commission would be able to tell the Reparation Commission


next week what was the position. In reply to the Prime Minister he stated that he thought very soon German exports might rise to 50 per cent, of pre-war.

THE PRIME MINISTER remarked that our exports were 60 per cent, of pre-war, and we had our shipping services as well, which might bring us up to 80 per cent, in all, of pre-war. He did not think, however, we could carry on if reduced even to 50 per cent.

SIR JOHN BRADBURY said that one of the difficulties was that, owing to the fluctuations of the Mark, there was high domestic consumption of commodities in Germany, so that there was not very much available for export. And even in regard to what was available there was the psychological difficulty of finding customers, to which, the Prime Minister had referred.

SIR ROBERT HORNE remarked that the Germans had been spending a good deal of their earnings on re-equipping themselves for the future.

SIR BASIL BLACKETT asked if there was any probability of a strong enough Government being established in Germany to survive the difficult situation which would arise on an attempt to restore the economic situation? That was one of the principal difficulties.

THE PRIME MINISTER said the trouble was that there was no-one with sufficient authority to insist on the adoption of the necessary measures. Here we had a Government strong enough to do it, and the nation was generally willing to follow the lead of the Government. That was not the case in Germany. In a conversation with Herr Stinnes he had told him this. Herr Stinnes had replied that the Government in Germany did not represent the nation. Until the nation responded to some appeal it was difficult to put matters right. Supposing Stinnes and Hindenburg, or some other
great leaders and authorities in the German nation put their heads together and told the German Government what they had to do, was there, he asked, anyone strong enough to tell the? nation "This is what we must do"?

SIR JOHN BRADBURY recalled that his own attitude had always been rather a pessimistic one, but nevertheless he thought there was a line of policy which possessed the bare possibility of restoring situation. This policy would involve, first, a reduction of reparations to a figure which both the world at large and Germany believed to be within Germany&apos;s capacity to pay. That would reverse the flight of capital and so bring about the first step. And, second, that the Bankers Committee should be called together again on French initiative. If it could report to the Reparation Commission that if the figure for reparations were reduced to X then the world would give a loan to Germany, a second, important step could he taken.

THE PRIME MINISTER said the trouble was that the French appeared to have a fixed idea that everyone should surrende? their reparations except France and Belgium. If all would abandon their claims in the same proportion it would be a different matter. Otherwise, however, he did not think it would he possible to carry such a proposal through Parliament. Suppose the Chancellor of the Exchecquer went to the House of Commons and said it was proposed to abandon the British share of German reparations as well as the French debt, but that France and Belgium were to retain their share, what would be the result?

SIR JOHN BRADBURY added that if we were to let France off her debt to us the French would at once turn their attention to worrying Germany again. At present they were very alarmed at the position.

THE PRIME MINISTER, while admitting that his suggestion
was rather a dangerous one, asked whether it was not necessary for us to leave the French to become somewhat more frightened than they were at present?

SIR BRADBURY said the danger was that if the matter were left alone and no action ware taken, Germany might break up so badly that the situation would be irretrievable.

SIR ROBERT KINDERSLEY said that in a private conversation with Mr Morgan before the latter went to Scotland, which, was before the murder of Dr. Rathenau and the recent happenings in Germany, they had both thought, that if reparations were reduced it might be possible to raise s loan. In reply to the Prime Minister, he said that the loan they had contemplated was 500,000,000 dollars from America and perhaps £25,000,000 from Great Britain. 

 Since recent events, however,there was not quite the same feeling of confidence in regard to the German political situation. In present circumstances it was very difficult to say, even if a settlement were reached in regard to how much Germany was to pay in reparations, whether a loan could be raised.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that if a loan could not be obtained, then it might be beat to let the situation reach bottom before building up.

SIR ROBERT KINDFRSLEY doubted if that were possible. He alluded to the case of Russia and Austria.

THE PRIME MINISTER said there were essential differences between the case of Germany and that of Russia and Austria. Germany had a great Industrial population which was always working. 

SIR ROBERT WINDERSLEY asked whether there was not every probability of industrial trouble accompanying any attempt to rebuild German credit?

THE PRIME MINISTER, reverting to Sir John Bradbury&apos;s remarks earlier in the meeting, pointed out that as soon as


people in Germany began to save their money instead of spending it all on purchases of commodities, unemployment would necessarily result. Sooner or later, however, that was bound to come in any event. He did not see how a collapse was to he avoided. Supposing a loan, such as Sir Robert Kindersley had contemplated, were issued, how wuch would go to reparations?

SIR ROBERT KINDERSLEY said that his and Mr Morgan&apos;s idea had been that if Germany raised a loan of  140,000,000, about £50,000,000 would be retained for Germany.

THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that that would not save the situation for Long.

SIR ROBERT KINDERSLEY pointed out that to this might be added the German foreign balances which might than return to Germany.

SIR ROBERT HORNE thought that Europe would expect the British Government to devise some plan to meet the situation. From a psychological point of view it would he a good plan if M. Poincare would take the initiative in calling the Bankers together again. That, at any rate, would do no-one any harm. 

THE PRIME MINISTER agreed that their report would be of some value.

SIR ROBERT BORNE said that even if the loan failed it would be worth while for the Bankers Committee to meet again to say what would, he Germany&apos;s capacity to pay. This alone would stave off the further fall of the Mark for a time.

SIR ROBERT KINDERSLEY said that this would he a considerable extension of the Bankers&apos; Committee&apos;s terms of reference, and at present he was convinced the Committee had not the material on which to base a recommendation as to what Germany could pay.


THE PRIME MINISTER recalled that when this question had first been considered the British Government had decided to call together a strong Committee to advise as to what Germany could pay. It had included the loading authorities from the City, including the Governor of the Bank, Mr Herbert Gibbs (who were the best financial experts that could be obtained), Lord Sumber (in order to bring the highest judicial mind to bear on the subject), and Mr Hughes and Mr Walter Long had been added. It had been felt desirable to do something to check the great expectations of public opinion. This Committee, however, instead of reporting a small figure, to the best of his recollection, had given their opinion that Germany could pay from £12,000,000,000 to £15,000,000.

SIR JOHN BRADBURY said it might be possible to give an estimate of what Germany could pay for three years ahead, but it was impossible for any experts to say what she could pay over a long term of years.

THE PRIME MINISTER agreed that this was the case, owing to the many uncertain factors in the case. Political conditions, for example, could not possibly be foreseen for far ahead. That was why the British Empire Delegation at Paris had insisted that there should he an independent body to estimate what Germany could pay.

SIR ROBERT KINDERSLEY agreed that nobody could determine what Germany could pay, with so many uncertain factors.

THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that the total now fixed, was less than the British National Debt.

SIR BASIL BLACKETT said that at their present value the schedules were only worth £3,500,000,000. which was far less than our National Debt.

SIR ROBERT HORNE thought there would be a great shock to public opinion if we did not try to do something. The fall in the Mark was paralysing financial business in the City.


THE PRIME MINISTER said it was not paralysing industrial business. He recalled that M. Poincare had undertaken to come to London at the end of the month.

SIR ROBERT HORNE thought that either Sir John Bradbury or Lord Hardinge might he instructed to see M. Poincare and sound him as to whether he would he willing to take the initiative in calling together the Bankers&apos; Committee.

THE PRIME MINISTER said his view was that the Finance Ministers should meet first. The Reparation Commission and the Finance Ministers should prepare the ground. The Reparation Commission might be unwilling to take certain responsibilities, and, if so, the Finance Ministers might meet.

SIR JOHN BRADBURY thought that the Reparation commission would probably agree to recommend a moratorium.

SIR BASIL BLACKERT pointed out that that did not put a stop to the clearing-house payments.

SIR JOHN BRADBURY thought it was possible a moratorium for these might also he recommended.

SIR ROBERT HORNE, in reply to the Prime Minister, said these clearing-house payments amounted to £2,000,000 a month and concerned the private debts of Germany.

THE PRIME MINISTER asked if these were what was known as the "cold storage" bills?

SIR BASIL BLACKETT said that they were, but that as a matter of fact most of the British bills had been paid. THE PRIME MINISTER asked whether Sir Robert Horne would see M. Lasteyris?

SIR ROBERT HORNE did not think this was of much value, as M. Poincare kept the decision in these matters largely in his own hands. It would be useful if M. Poincare brought M. Lasteyrie with him to London.

THE PRIME MINISTER agreed that he ought to bring some expert. He asked who advised M. Poincare?


SIR JOHN BRADBURY thought M. Seydoux advised him a good deal, but he could not tell whether M. Poincare took his advice or whether he was in M. Poincare&apos;s confidence.THE PRIME MINISTER said he was not yet so convinced that it would not be better to let matters alone for the present. He doubted if France was yet ready for a big deal, and nothing but a big deal would be of any value. He thought it might be better to give the French time to realise the real situation more fully. He admitted risks in this policy, but there were risks in every policy.

SIR JOHN BRADBURY said that six months ago reparations might have been finally fixed at a fairly large figure. But six months hence things might get so bad in Germany that reparations would be lost altogether. Suppose,  for example, France were asked to take 40 per cent, of the present reparations?

THE PRIME MINISTER was convinced that France would not look at it.

SIR JOHN BRADBURY asked whether this would be the case if France realised that by postponing for six months she might get nothing at all? It was possible, of course, that France might prefer to see a complete collapse, leaving her free to act.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that he did not believe that Germany could never pull through, but he did not think she could pull through with the present load on her back. The French, however, would not come round until the ship was in sight of the reefs.

SIR ROBERT HORNE said he would like Sir John Bradbury to have authority to sound M. Poincare as to whether he would take the initiative in summoning the Bankers&apos; Committee.

THE PRIME MINISTER thought it would be a mistake to make any proposals to M. Poincare just at present. It was


necessary to leave France to realise all the facts of the situation. Then something might be done.

SIR JOHN BRABBUBY pointed out that it would he very difficult for M. Poincare to summon the Bankers&apos; Committee without reversing his previous attitude.

THE PRIME MINISTER repeated that he did not feel like taking the initiative yet, as France had not fully realised the situation.

SIR ROBERT KINDERSLEY said that the French were already a good deal scared. The Americans could afford to view matters more calmly.

SIR BASIL BLACKETT said that if the France followed the Mark the French would become very scared.

SIR JOHN BRADBURY and SIR ROBERT KINDERSLEY both said that the France was bound to follow the Mark.

SIR ROBERT HORNE asked, what answer he was to give to questions in the House of Commons on the subject if the policy was to leave matters for the present?

THE PRIME MINISTER said that the House of Commons was just as puzzled ahout this matter as anyone else, and would accept a reply that the Governmment was watching the situation very carefully.

SIR JOHN BRADBURY said that the Commission of Guarantees was due back from Berlin on the following day. He did not know whether their report had yet bean drafted, but in any event the report would be available in a few days.

SIR ROBERT HORNE said he had to addrees the Bankers at the Lord Mayor&apos;a Annual Dinner on the following Thursday and he would very much like to have something to say on this subject.

THE PRIME MINISTER thought it impossible that any decision could be taken before then.

SIR ROBERT KINDERSLEY pointed to the reaction the collapse of the Mark had in Holland, Scandinavia and Denmark


1671In the latter country the Banish Bank had loot . 4,000,000in two years, and the State had had to co*ne to its sestet-anoe.   The position in Sweden was very bad, and in Hollandit was almost intolerable,&quot;PH$ PRITIf! MINISTER said that if any constructive -policycon Id ho offered he would be only too glad to consider %i.The only proposal that had been isade to hiss, however, wasthat we should aek Prance to do something which she souIdnot at present possibly do.   He felt it was useless to press this? until the situation was better realised in Prance,SIP POBWPT SfOPTP? thought that the present situationoffered the last chance of restoring the position.THK/ PRIME MBTISIRR did not think there was a chance atall at the moment.
