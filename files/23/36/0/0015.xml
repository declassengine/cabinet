THE PRIME MINISTER drew attention to the following Question and Answer in the House of Commons on the previous day:-

Mr WISE asked the Prime Minister whether it is to be understood from the declarations made on behalf of the Government in the Debate yesterday that if the Russian Government returns an unconditional affirmative to the questions put by M. Litvinoff the Government will be prepared to assist British property owners and others in their negotiations with the Soviet Governmenet?

THE PRIME MINISTER:  Yes, Sir.   If the Russian Government announces plainly its intention to pursue the policy foreshadowed by the Russian Delegation at THE Hague, the British Government would certainly do all in their power to assist their nationals to enter into negotions with the Russian Government and to carry such negotiations to a successful conclusion. The extension to Russian trade of facilities under any scheme of export credit and trade facilities would follow in due course."

This, he pointed out, meant that, the British Government would encourage their nationals to go back to Russia and give them the advantages of the Export Credit and Trade Facilities Schemes.

M. KRASSIN pointed out that there was no recognition for Russia, and that this was an obstacle for the big capitalists embarking in Russian trade.

THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that for trading purpose Russia was recognised under the Russian Trade Agreement.

M. KRASSIN said that this did not really suffice. For example, he knew of discussions in regard to oil concassions, and so forth, which would not come to a successful conclusion until Russia was recognised.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that this was not the real reason. Once it was generally understood that the two Governments had an understanding, all these Agreements would go through.

 
M. KRASSIN said that was why he wanted to knew whether they could not conclude some further arrangement and get the result proclaimed to the world.

THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that the idea of the British Government was to effect recognition gradually, beginning with a Charge d&apos;Affaires in London and Moscow, with full authority, and reaching full recognition later when the position had been proved satisfactory. If, during this interim period, the Russian Soviet Government was able to make arrangements with British capitalists, no doubt the latter would press that we should give full recognition and exchange Ambassadors.

M. KRASSIN said that no particular difficulty arose in making arrangements with capitalists in cases similar to the arrangement proposed with Mr Urquhart. There were other cases, however, of much greater difficulty, where it was impossible to restore property in its original state. In such cases it was necessary to create new trusts.

THE PRIME MINISTER made some further remarks elaborating what he had already said on the subject of recognition, adding that it was necessary to obtain a juridical position, for Russian subjects in the British Courts and for British subjects in the Russian Courts.

M. KRASSIN said that the existing Trade Agreement could be broken at any moment.

THE PRIME MINISTER said this was true of any form of recognition.

M. KRASSIN said the present position was really only one of an armistice. They wanted something more definite and which would be tantamount to absolute recognition.

THE PRIME MINISTER said the idea of the British Government was that the next stage was for Russia to be in the


some position as Germany had been immediately after signing the Peace Treaty, when she had not received full diplomatic ceremonial recognition.

M. KRASSIN pointed out that this position had been reached after Germany had signed the Peace Treaty. It seemed necessary for the British and Russian Governments to sign something.

THE PRIME MINISTER agreed that they might have to sign something.

M. KRASSIN suggested that if the Russian Government accepted the proposal made at The Hague the Trading Agreement might be replaced by something better.

THE PRIME MINISTER agreed that in this eventuality arrangements might be made for Soviet Russia to have a Charge d&apos;Affaires in London and the British Government a charge d&apos;Affaires in Moscow. Later, if all went well, the final step might be taken and full recognition granted.

M. KRASSIN asked if the next step could be taken without any general Conference?

SIR PHILIP LLOYD-GREAME said this was the case. What had been agreed at The Hague had been that if Soviet Russia carried out the policy proposed, it would create an atmosphere in which Governments could carry out such negotiations as they thought fit. What M. Krassin appeared to have feared was that British nationals would not go back to Russia. The Prime Minister had said in the House of Commons on the previous day that if the Russian Government adopted the policy foreshadowed by the Russian Delegation at The Hague, the British Government would encourage their nationals to enter into negotiations with the Russian Government.

THE PRIME MINISTER added that they would give them credit facilities and generally back them up. If that happened, the British nationals would probably say that it
would be better to come to an arrangement with Russia.

M. KRASSIN said there were a good many difficulties. Alluding to the case of Mesara Coates, he said that it was very difficult for them to do business in Russia until some currency agreement was fixed up. There were also great transport difficulties. Mr Urquhart might conclude an Agreement, but might find that the transport difficulties rendered it impossible to put it into effect.

SIR PHILIP LLOYD-GREAME said that the British business men who entered into arrangements with Russia knew perrfectly well what conditions were, and they did not expect to find railways running with the precision with which they ran in the United states of America, for example.

THE PRIME MINISTER then said that the position as regards recognition had been fully stated in his speech in the House of Commons on April 3, 1922, before the Genoa Conference, from which he read the following extract:-

"I now come to the question in the minds of a good many of my friends,- What recognition of Russia would this involve no further recognition until the House of Commons approved -- none. After approval, the stages of recognition would be those which ensue after most of the peace treaties -- not all, but I will explain. It would involve access by other countries and their nationals to the courts of Russia; it would involve access by Russia and her nationals to our courts. Without this fully legal status, business would be impossible, quite impossible. It would involve the establishment of the usual agencies by which the trader in foreign lands is protested. The nomination of these agents must be entirely subject to the approval of the Governments in both cases. What would be involved in the way of diplomatic representation? A feeling has been very generally expressed that before full and ceremonial diplomatic representation is accorded, a probationary period should be interposed. Some diplomatic representation on both sides is essential. Otherwise business cannot be effectively transacted or business men protected. It is, however, felt that the character and extent of the diplomatic representation accorded depends not merely on the conditions which Russia is prepared to accept, but upon the actual proof which she gives of her bonn fides. Let me say quite frankly that the way in which some of the more important of the Clauses of the Trade Agreement


have been violated has not been encouraging. Propaganda, interference in our country, and in other countries in which we are interested, has not ceased as completely as we had a right to expect when that document was signed. It is not for us to dictate to the Genoa Conference, but it is necessary that we should indicate beforehand what our views are upon this most important subject and the policy, with which the British delegates will enter that Conference. Until the House of Commons ratifies, there can be no change in the representation or in the extent of the diplomatic recognition of Russia. If the agreement is ratified, than the course pursued could be that pursued in the case of Germany after the Treaty of Peace.   We could proceed by steps.   The Powers wished in the case of Germany, before exchanging ambassadors, that a reasonable interval should intervene to test her bona fides. There would be no full ceremonial diplomatic representation in the case of  Russia, as there was not in the case of Germany, until the Powers ere satisfied that Russia is really endeavouring to carry out the terms of her undertaking.   That interval is one which is usually established in case of peace between nations. Russia would be represented here by a charge d&apos;affaires, and we should he represented in Russia by a corresponding official, until such time as ww felt that it was desirable to establish full ceremonial diplomatic relations. In the case of Germany, that was accorded twelve months after the signature of peace, and six months after ratification by all the Powers. That would present a period of probation, which it would be wise to establish in the matter of ceremonial diplomatic representation, in order to receivethe necessary guarantees, not merely an paper, but in practice; that the Russian government intend not only themselves to honour the obligations of the Treaty, but that they have established sufficient control over ths extremists and powerful organisations in their midst which are now engaged in challenging the new policy of the Soviet Government. Those will be the conditions which we propose that the British delegates shall submit to the Genoa Conference.   M. KRASSIN said he had already seen this,, and thanked the Prime Minister for the copy of Volume 158, No.40, containing this speech, which the Prime Minister had handed to him. THE PRIME MINISTER said that if the traders began to go to Russia and the British Government were in a position to say "You can go now", than gradually they would reach some more permanent relations between the two countries. At present there was very great doubt as to what was happening
in Russia. Whenever the situation seemed promising something would happen. The Russian Government would take some action, such as the issue of the Memorandum at Genoa in which they defended the doctrine of repudiation. It was probably difficult for M. Krassin to realise how great an effect this had had. Moreover, it had been totally unnecessary.

M. KRASSIN said it had been necessary, for consumption in Russia.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that when the British Government had given the Russians a Memorandum at Genoa they had merely stated their terms, and not taken the opportunity to defend their whole position. He hoped that M. Krassin would emphasize this point when he returned to Moscow. 

M. KRASSIN remarked that in ths Russian view there had been a  good deal of propagands in the Allies  documents gift

SIR PHILIP LLOYD-? suggested that the Russian reply should be similar to the business like document which theRussian Delegation had passed across the table at The Hague.

THE PRIME MINISTER asked M. Krassin when he would be back?

M. KRASSIN said "in a fortnight".

On saying "Goodbye", THE PRIME MINISTER asked M. Krassin to do his beat to obtain a plain and simple answer, which would make future procedure infinitely easier.

M. Krassin then withdraw.
