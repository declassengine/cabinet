NOTE OF A CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE ROUMANIAN CHARGE D&apos;AFFAIRES on TUESDAY, 19th September, 1922 at 3.30 p.m.

 The Prime Minister was accompanied by Mr. Churchill and Sir Maurice Hankey.

 THE ROUMANIAN CHARGE D&apos;AFFAIRES, speaking in French said he had come to deliver the reply of the Roumanian Government to the message Mr. Lloyd George had asked him to convey a few days ago. The Roumanian Government agreed generally with Mr. Lloyd George and shared his anxiety as to the repercussion on the Danube and the Dniester of events in Asia Minor, more especially having regard to the possible combination of Turkey, Bulgaria and Russia. Since, however, the main attack must come from Russia, the Roumanian Government considered that the interest both of Roumania and Europe was best secured by keeping their main force on the Dniester. However, wishing to maintain solidarity of the Allied front, Roumania was prepared to co-operate with the Allied Powers by sending a contingent to Constantinople. In their view, Serbia being under loss immediate pressure, ought to be in a position to do more than Roumania in the Straits. This menace to Europe brought into prominence the necessity for the provision of munitions. Mr. Lloyd George, he thought, would remember the great need for munitions in the Great War. The Roumanian Government also emphasised the necessity that in the pourparlers of the Great Powers, Roumania should participate both in the discussions and in the decisions. They wished to know what kind of a military detachment the Powers expected Roumania to provide and what measures were to be taken for securing command of the Black Sea.


MB. CHURCHILL observed at this point that oiuershad already been given regarding the command of the black sea.SEE CHARGE B&apos;AFEAIRE3 said that this was a vitalpoint to Eouraania, on which his Government laid stress.He asked if the Prime Minister could give him some particu-lars.OH! PRIME MINISTER said that Great Britain had for sometime had a powerful naval force in the vicinity of theStraits and thi3 had been almost doubled,      This force was perfectly able to control the Black Sea as well asthe Straits and the Sea of Marmara.     He had also received very encouraging statements from the naval authorities as to the power of the Navy to prevent thepassage of Turkish Nationalist,  forces from Asia to Europe,even If the Allies did not hold the Asiatic shore.THE CHARGE  &quot;APPAIRES reiterated that this was amatter of great importance a3 the Roumanians envisaged the transport of their troops to Constantinople by the black Sea.The PRtME MINISTER, referring to the size of the force to be provided, said that Lord Curzon had left for Paristhat afternoon for a Conversation with M,Polnoarc, after which he would be in a better position to say what hadbeen arranged.     Ho hoped to be dhle tb give an ahswor with-^in the next day or two.     He emphasised the desire of theBritish Government that the Allies should all act together.At present there were signs that Prance was somewhat reluo-tant to oppose forces to the Turks, though he emphasised the fact that the British Government also earnestly hopedthat there would be no hostilities.     Nevertheless, if
the Turkish Nationalists tried to cross to Europe, wewere prepared to sink their transports and to prevent their passage, no matter, whether the transports were Turkish or Husskh,&apos;JHE CE.1EGE E&apos;AEPAlEE3 insisted on the importance ofthere being ho vacillation in dealing with Asiatics.     It wasvital there should be no fissure in the Allied front.If therewas it would be to play Into the hands of the Turkish National-&apos;ists.     He then made some remarks as to trie French apprehensionsin regard to Germany, and appeared to suggest that perhaps some concessions could he made to Franco on the subject of repara-tions.THE PRIME MINISTER said he had just read a telegram which indicated that the position in regard to reparations was cleared up for the moment and there was no need for concessions.He said that we would if necessaryj take action alone toprevent Muatapha Vernal*s army from crossing into Europe andwe believed that the Navy could effect this.ME.CHURCH ILL added that it was nevertheless vary import-ant that thfe Turks should not be allowed to reach the shoresof the Bospkoru3 and Dardanelles.     If th ey reached the Bosphaahsthey eouid bombard Perd and Galata   .     If they reached. Chanakthough they could not stop communication, they could embarrassnavigation.THE PRIME MINISTER eaia that of course the Navy couldnot pretend   to prevent the passage of small detachmentsacross- the narrow Straits, but they could prevent the passageof a large army.MR.CHURCH ILL emphasised that the real danger to Roumaniawas the passage of a large army to Europe.     If that could he
 prevented there was little danger to Roumania from the Bolshevists or anyone else.

 THE CHARGE D&apos;AFFAIRES again urged the desire of his Government to know what kind of a contingent should be sent.

 THE PRIME MINISTER gave the same reply as before.

 THE CHARGE D&apos;AFFAIRES then asked as to the rumours that the French were withdrawing their troops from the Asiatic shore.

 THE PRIME MINISTER said that the French and Italians were maintaining their troops on the Ismid Peninsula but that the French were leaving the defence of Chanak mainly to British forces, which were actually there. Some 200 French soldiers had been sent to Chanak by the French High Commissioner without first obtaining instructions from the French Government and these were now being withdrawn, but those at Ismid would be retained.

 THE CHARGE D&apos;AFFAIRES asked that immediately after Lord Curzon&apos;s conversations with M. Poincar√© he might be given a clear assurance as to the command of the Black Sea and particulars as to what contingent Roumania should send.

 THE PRIME MINISTER expressed satisfaction at the message he had received that Roumania was prepared to send a contingent.

 THE CHARGE D&apos;AFFAIRES then raised the question of military equipment.

 THE PRIME MINISTER said that as regards the mastery of the Black Sea, he was ready at once to give absolute assurances. The whole Mediterranean Fleet was available and it was being greatly strengthened by the reinforcements from the Atlantic Fleet. This would provide an overwhelming force with full orders to sink by force anything which threatened the Allies in the Straits or Black Sea, which would include Roumania if she co-operated. As regards war


material, he thought that if Roumania was in difficulties,we could give some assistance.     She best plan would befor the Charge  affaires to let us know what Roumania rc-quirad. ,saidSHE CHARGE D&apos;AFFAIRES/he thought assistance was requiredin aviation.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the British Governmentwere sending a large aerial force to the Dardanelles whichwould provide an overwhelming force as against the Turks.MR. CHURCH III suggested that the Charge drAffairesshould telegraph to his Government asking them to replyby telegram as to what form of war material they most needed.This would save loss of time:-.THE CHARGE D&apos;AFFAIRES repeated that he wished toknow if possible to-morrow or the day after, the exactcontingent which was required of Roumania and to receiveassurances of provision of war material.     He again referredto the command of the Black Sea. &apos; 1THE PRIME MINISTER said that Roumanian danger-was from submarines.     The British Government had plenty of destroyers at Constantinople for dealing with them.THE CHARGE D&apos;AFFAIRES asked if the British Governmentcould also provide sea transport.THE PRIME MINISTER said that assistance of this naturecould be rendered.MR.CHURCHILL said that the British Government couldguarantee transports and an escort.3HE PRIME MINISTER agreed.     He explained on a maphow the western end of the Black Sea between Roumania andthe Straits could ba protected by naval forces from constantinople.     Having protected transports againstGermany, ha did not think the Havy had anything to fear from Russian submarines.     He undertook to let
the Charge&quot; &amp;&apos;Affaires know within a day or two the positionas resulting from the Paris conversations.     Atpresent natters were rather entangled hut the French did not wish to see the freedom of the Straits lost any more than we did.     He: thought that Lord CurzonH/Ould he able to cometo an agreement with M,Poincare.   - In any event, hoy/ ever,the British Government did not intend to allow MustaphaKemalTs troops to cross the Straits.     In replyto a question by the Charge&quot; d&apos;Affaires, he said that thehritish Government had no desire to take Constantinoplefrom the Turks, hut until a peace was arranged, theydid not intend, to have Mustapha kemal*s forces in Europe.2, Whitehall Gardens,  SV&quot;&apos;./l19th September,1922
