NOTE OF CONVERSATIONS WITH M. THEUNIS,ON SATURDAY, AUGUST 12th, 1922, at 2.15 p.m. and 3 p.m. (From memory)

Sir Maurice Hankey called at the Carlton Hotel at 2.15 p.m. to notify M. Theunis&apos;s Private Secretary, whom he had not been able to reach on the telephone, that the Prime Minister proposed to hold a private meeting with M. Poincare, M. Schanzer and M. Theunis at 11 a.m. on Monday. He there encountered. M. Theuhis who left the luncheon table to speak to him.

M. Theunis agreed that the Experts were not likely to report until late that evening, or next day. He commented, however, that the Germans would he in default on Tuesday and no answer would have been given to their communication. However, he did not press this objection. He then informed Sir Maurice Hankey that M. Poincare had had a very bad Press in Paris that morning. M. Poincare like M. Priand was very susceptible to Press attacks, and it was now reported by the French journalists that M. Poincare was about to issue a communique stating that the French had not given way at all during the London Conference. M. Theunis was convinced that M. Poincare&apos;s attitude would be very much stiffened by this incident.

M. Theunis said he was going to see Sir Robert Horne before the afternoon meeting of Experts in order to say that he thought the British Government&apos;s attitude had been too stiff. M. Poincare had had to give up all the most objectionable of the proposals with which he came to London, but he complained that he had got absolutely nothing in return. If a break came, the French would go into the Ruhr almost at once. He thought his...


his own proposal for the reconciliation of the British andFrench views or; the subject of the &quot;Ruhr had been misunderstood.He had. really proposed to adopt Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s plan forapplying to the mines and forests the plan already adopted as regards Customs, namely, that the proceeds should he paid into a special fund of the Reichshank which the ReparationCommission could impound in case of a - German default.    he admitted it was doubtful whether Germany would accept eventhe Frit is1- proposals, but be. subsequently corrected, thisby saying, that they would accept them if pressed on themby Great Britain,    Fe said that Germany would default on coal deliveries within V-e next few weeks, and when thatoccurred, he intended to  instruct the Belgian delegate onthe Reparation Commission to declare Germany in default.    Igathered that he preferred to declare a default on thisrelatively minor question rather than on the larger question.Sir Maurice Hankey reported this conversation atonce to the Prime Minister,    Learning that M. Theunis was with Sir Robert name in the Treasury Board Room, the PrimeMinister at 2.50 p.m. asked them both to come to the cabinet room to discuss these questions.M. Theunis repeated substantially the sta tementwhich he had made to Sir Maurice Hankey,    Be pointed out thatthe break which seemed almost Inevitable was coming on a veryminor question, and he strongly urged that some attempt shouldbe made to meet Iv*,  Poincare, whose political position was really difficult, by means of words.The Prime Minister pointed out that it was nota matter of words that was  involved, but a. matter of principle.If Germany were to refuse the proposals - and he doubted ifany German Government which accepted them could last - theReparation Commission would have to declare Germany in default,and Great Britain would have to support France in the coercion
of Germany.    It was unthinkable for the British Governmentto coerce Germany on a point on which they were convincedthat the Allies were in fee wrong.    That was the greatdifficulty of tha situation.    If the French intended tocoerce Germany or this issue, they must undertake  it them-selves and Great Britain would adopt her usual policy ofbiding her time.     The Cabinet bed met that morning andhad been unanimous in urging the British Government to stand firm.    The attitude of America must not be forgotten .    he doubted if America would stand by and see the Frenchoccupying the Ruhr for a reason like this.M. Theunis questioned whether America could do much.The Prime Minister pointed out tha t one way. andanother the Americans could put on very heavy pressure.Incidentally there was a good deal of conversationabout the difficulty owing to the fact that the German Statesowned the forests in Germany.- ^ Hi. x !
