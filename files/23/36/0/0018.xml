(Appendix)THE .PRIME MIRIS1ER commerited that this resultedin a British figure of 50 milliards as compared withthe Prench 80 milliards.     He then gave a resume ofthe figures taken from a report by the Bankers TrustCompany of New York, which he proposed to utilise thesame afternoon in reply to M. Poincare (See I.CP.250).SIR ROBERT EOilKE said that if a comparison wasmade between the British War Debt and the Prench VlarDebt, it would be found that the difference was greaterwhatthan/the Prench claimed tor be disbursing on recoverableexpenditure.
SHE PRIME MOT 1STER asked how the Bankers Trust Companycane upon their figures.SIR BASIL 3MCBETT said he thought that their representtative had worked closely With the representative of theErench Treasury.     A similar hook had been produced by theBankers Trust Company in regard to Great Britain.THE PRIME MINISTER said he had that book with him.     \SIR ROBERT HORHE raised the question of whether itwould be wise to take unverified figures such as those ofthe Bankers Trust Company*THE PRIME MIBISTER said he had tried to find semeneutral and unbiassed basis from which to quote his figures.He said ho proposed to repeat a figure Sir. Robert Hornebad mentioned at the morning meeting -that Germany had inone form or -another handed over the value of  425,000,000 tothe Allies for reparation, cost of armies, etcSIR ROBERT HO REE said that if the cost of billets in occupied territory were included, the figure was nearer 500,000,000.     This would include State properties handedover in the ceded territories, ships, coal, and other deliver-ies in kind.- THE PRIME MIEISTER said he also proposed to mention that Genaany had had no loss than three revolutions, namely,the original revolution which upset the Kaiser, the famousputsch, and the Spartacist revolution.SIR ROBERT K0RFB then quoted the actual figures fromva paper by Mr.Ieith Ross of the Reparation Commission.. SIR 1AISIEG -.ORTHIJTGTQB-EVAITS then hanied the PrimeMinister a document containing a number of draft resolutions  .setting out counter-proposals to M.poincare*s proposals.THE PRIME MI1TISTEH said he thought the first tilingto he done was to dispose of M. Poincare&quot; *s proposals and show then to he impracticable.-
MR. CFAMBERIAIH., said he had not written anythingoat nor completed anything so useful as Sir laming&apos; hrthington-Evans1 proposals.    -His impression when he left the morning meeting had heen that the intention wasthat the Prime Minister should knock to pieced M. Poincare!sproposals, which were impracticable.     He wondered, however,whether it would not be advisable In the first Instance tosay that he had discussed&apos;the matter with his colleagues and took a grave view of Mc-poincare^*s proposals, and that before speaking he would like to hear&apos;what the other allies had to say.THE PRIME MIEISvEE thought the other Allies would be unwilling to speak until he had spoken,      Signor Schanzer,he said, had already asked him to speak first.     He agreedthat Mr.Chamberlain^ proposal was the right policy If wecould rely on the other Allies to express their opinions,but he was confident they would not speak freely until hehad spoken.ME. CHAMBERIAIP ashed whether the Prime Minister thoughtit worth while to refer to the Air question.     This was onebranch of the French expenditure on defence which was alsoputting us to a great deal of expense,SIR L AMI EG   ORTHIPC-TON-EVAES thought it would bebetter not to raise this question as the Prench feared the revival of Germany in the air more than anything else.THE PRIME MINISTER, after mentioning that he proposedto answer M. Poincare&apos; on the subject of disarmament,  remarked that the first thing to be done was to dispose of K.I5oincareTeproposals.     He thoiight the best plan would be to submit themto the experts for a report.      If the experts reported thatthey would not produce much money, he did not think
H. Poincare could press then.sir JOE I BRiBBUEY remarked, that M.Poincare&apos;sproposals had never heen put to the Reparation Commission,which was the proper body to deal with them.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W./18th August,1922
Appendix.The British Treasury has adopted the sound policy ofproviding for its expenditure out of revenue and has notborrowed on the expectation of receipts from Germany.     Butif it had chosen to do so, it could have produced a budget of Recoverable Expenditure representing a formidable arrayof &quot;Advances to Germany&quot;.The Brench Budget of Recoverable Expenditure is made up approximately as followsMillion Francs.Assistance to Prisoners of War......     1,000Separation Allowances ...      ......15,000Pensions ...      ...      ...      ...      . *.    15,00029*000&apos;-Damage to Property     ............45*000Interest ...      ... ...       6; 000i80,000The corresponding British figures would ber oughly :-Million  yAssistance to Prisoners of Y/ar......Separation Allowances (on French scale)(IT.3. much less than the actualex-peniture)      ......      ......        280Pensions (also on Preach scale) ......       500Damage to property (claims actually paid)       180,Interest,  (say) ............ 80 &apos;Y 1.040   !
