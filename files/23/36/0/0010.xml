Majesty&apos;s Government.)greg? -NOTE OP A CONVERSATION HELD AT 10,DOWNING STREET, LONDON,  S.W.1,  onMONDAY, JULY 3, 1922, at 12 Noon.PRESENT;.TIONSThe Right Hon. D. Lloyd George, O.M.,M.P.,Prime Minister.The Right Hon. The Earl of Balfour, K.G.,O.M.   Acting Secretary of State forForeign Affairs.Mr R.G. Vansittart, C.M.G.,M.V.O., ForeignOffice.Sir Maurice Hankey, G.C.B., (Secretary)Sir Edward Grigg, K.C.V.0.,C.M.G.This Conversation took place for the purpose of compar-ing notes in regard to a Memorandum which had been furnished by Mo Schanzer, which Lord Balfour read to the meeting (SeeAppendix).THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that the Preamble atleast implied that the Italian Government would supportthe British Government on German questions.Mr VANSITTART said that the Foreign Office idea wasthat the questions of detail discussed in the memorandum should first be settled, and then we should submit ourown draft of the Preamble.It was generally agreed that the Preamble, and, indeed,the whole Memorandum would require re-drafting, and that
Mr vansittart&apos;s proposal was acceptable.ME NEAR[east.PalestineMANDATEMD ARTICLEI op the(BIPARTITEl&amp;REEMENToIRITISHupport toTALIANLAIMS INBE ITALIANMR-IL INORTHERNHATOLIA.The discussion of the first paragraph, which dealt withthe Near East, was postponed while a draft despatch to theFrench Government, prepared by Lord Balfour, was sent for from the Foreign Office. (See later,)LORD balfour said there was no objection in principle to the second paragraph of M. Schanzer*s Memorandum.Mr VANSITTART said that this was the point of view ofthe Foreign Office.   They felt, however, that in returnfor the concession made in regard to Article 6 of the tripartite Agreement the Italian Government should be askeddefinitely to pledge themselves to support the Mandate atthe Council of the League of Nations.   Instead of the wordsthat the Italian Government were &quot;disposed to&quot; support theMandate, should be substituted some such word as &quot;undertake&quot;.LORD balfour said that the Foreign Office did not muchlike the idea of the British Government pledging itselfto support applications by Italians for concessions -inthe Italian zone which might run counter to the claims ofBritish firms.   He himself felt, however, that we were tosome extent committed by the terms of the Tripartite Agree-ment, and it was only right that we should agree to this.Mr VANSITTART said that the Foreign Office agreed inprinciple to giving such support, subject to the intro-duction of some word such as &quot;equitable&quot; before the word&quot;claims&apos;&apos;;    and, further, that such support should be&quot;without^rejudiee to existing British rights&quot;.   They thoughtalso that the Agreement made some time back with M. Nogarashould stand.Mr VANSITTART said that the Foreign Office view wasthat for Article 4 should be substituted a mere confirmation-2-
of the Prime Ministers letter to M. Schanzer on thesubject of oil?    that is to say, the formula should re-affirm that when British and Italian firms had gottogether and were already in agreement to apply to exploitan oil undertaking the British and Italian Governmentss houl d supp o r t them.TEE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that the formula inM. Schanzer&apos;s Memorandum implied that the British would encourage British and Italian firms to undertake suchenterprises in Northern Anatolia.   He felt considerabledoubts as to what the effect of this would be on france and  the United States of America.   He agreed with MrVansittarfs proposal that the Article should merelyre-affirm what had already been stated in his letterwritten at Genoa to M. Sehanzer.THE COENACULUM.   THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Secretary of Statefor the colonies had views on this.   He hoped, however,that he might be willing to go a little further.Mr VANSITTART suggested that if the proposed Commissionon the Holy Places found in favour of the Italian claim,the British Government might undertake to support it atthe Council of the League of Nations.LORD balfour thought that this sounded almost B&amp;tmtnoffensive.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed,and pointed out that it wouldgive the impression that if the Commission reported in acontrary sense we would not support it.It was agreed  To reserve the question for M. Schanzerto take up direct with the Secretary ofState for the colonies .-TANGIER, LORD balfour pointed out that the draft had been care-!Para.6. fully worded to try and meet the British views .-3-
The suggestion was then made that perhaps the diffi-culty of Tangier might be surmounted by arranging themeeting between the British, French and Spanish governments to take place in London before the arrival of M. Schanzer.The first stage, therefore, in which only the three aboveGovernments were concerned, could be concluded in theabsence of the Italians, who would not have so much a grievance as if the meeting were held while M. Schanzerwas in London.    It was suggested, however, that in all probability M. Schanzer, on hearing that this meeting wasto take place in London, would insist on being invited.Mr VANSITTART said he had heard that information ofthe Italian desire to be present at the Tangier discus-sions had already leaked out in Paris.THE PRIME MINISTER proposed that some such formula asthe following might be adopted:-&quot;The British Government is prepared torecognise Italy&apos;s interest in thesolution of the question of Tangierexcept as regards discussion arisingout of reciprocal Treaties or otherengagements&quot;.Article 7, dealing with the question of Jubaland,was postponed for discussion between M. Schanzer and theSecretary of State for the Colonies.Article 8 was accepted in principle, subject to re-drafting .LORD BALFOUR pointed out that there was not much excuse for raising the question of Abyssinia, as the position there had not changed since 1906, the date of the previousAgreement.THE PRIME MINISTER recalled that the Italian people had probably not forgotten their defeats by Abyssinia, andfelt that sooner or later they would have to wipe them out.-4-
The position was somewhat similar to our own attitude inthe past towards the Mahdi.LORD BALFOUR pointed out the difference that the Mahdiwas at the head of a totally uncivilised nation, whereas the Abyssinian nation was semi-civilised, and hungryPowers were waiting for the break-up of the country.THE PRIME MINISTER asked what would be the result ifthe Italians obtained Abyssinia?Mr VANSITTART pointed out that Abyssinia was vital tothe water-supply of Egypt.    The Blue Nile rose in LakeTsana, and most important silt was washed down the BlueNile from these regions.   He explained on a map the impofet-ance of this water to Egypt.    He thought it would be suffi-cient to state that we were willing that the Italian expert,who was due to arrive in London today, should discuss thequestion with British experts.LORD BALFOUR pointed out that Article 9 only proposeddiscussion.   He felt, however, that it might frighten the abyssinian Government.Mr VANSITTART thought it would alarm the French as well.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that the rapprochementwhich had taken place between the British and italian governments at Genoa had rather alarmed the French.After further explanations on a map by Mr VANSITTART,it was agreed  That the question of Abyssinia should be postponed until after the conversations with the Italian expert.HE SENUSSI. Paragraph 10 was accepted in principle.HE DODECANESE.   LORD BALFOUR, referring to paragraph 11 of M. Schanzer&apos;sMemorandum, asked whether the whole of the Treaty ofVersailles, so far as concerned German colonial possessionsand Turkish possessions,was not based on the theory that
the conquered territory should he mandated?   He said thatthe Foreign Office did not think there was much in this argument.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that Thrace and the islands had been handed over to Greece without a Mandate.He suggested that the Italians might be given a mandate for the Island of Rhodes.LORD BALFOUR said that Stampalia was a worthless rockwith hardly any population and no resources.   Its onlymerit was that it could be turned into a naval base.   he did not believe, however, that this would be done, as itwould require a very large sum of money.   The Admiraltydid not at all like the idea of the Italians possessingthis Island.THE PRIME MINISTER said that Stampalia and Rhodes werethe most difficult points of the whole negotiation.   We&apos;were asked to give Greece away in her absence, and tosupport the Italians in a demand for something which was quite contrary to all the principles of Treaties of Peace.SIR MAURICE HANKEY reminded the Prime Minister that under the Treaty of London we were pledged to give the dodecanese to Italy.Mr VANSITTART suggested that we might agree that Rhodesshould be handed over to Italy in full sovereignty on condition that she did not demand Stampalia.LORD BALFOUR asked if it could not fairly be said thatthis was a matter between the Italians and the Greeks?He reminded the Prime Minister that any agreement with italy would evoke strong protests both in Greece and Jugo-Slavia.   He thought that it was very difficult for theBritish Government to commit itself on this question.They could not really dispose of Rhodes and Stampaliaoutside the Supreme Council.
THE PRIME MINISTER thought it was essential to promotesome conversations between the Greeks and the Italians onthe subject.   His suggestion was that we should say that wewould hand over Jubaland at some subsequent date, sayJanuary 1, 1924, or January 1, 1923, and that at some datepreceding that we should insist that the Italians shouldhave a meeting with the Greeks to discuss the question ofthe Dodecanese.LORD balfour asked how the Prime Minister would justifylinking the two questions?mHE PRIME MINISTER said he would not link them.   Hewould explain the delay about handing over Jubaland by stating that a number of arrangements had to be made before it could be handed over.   Although no connection would be definitely stated, the Italians would perfectly well under-stand that there was a connection.LORD BALFOUR asked if he would impose any conditionsof the handing over of Jubaland?THE PRIME MINISTER said he would impose no conditionsexcept that the whole of the Treaty must be fulfilled atonce, including the meeting between the Greeks and theItalians.   He felt that to hand over Stampalia to theItalians would look like bartering away the interests of greece in her absence., , ^ fcfv  li^*vwMr VANSITTART said that Annex I was accepted by theForeign Office, with the exception of one point where theItalians appeared to have inserted something additional.THE PRIME MINISTER said there must be a re-draft of the preamble in the first paragraph.   He thought the rightformula was that the two countries desired nto work together for peace and the reconstruction of Europe&quot;.

Mr VANSITTART said it was proposed to re-draft thisparagraph after agreement had been reached on details.THE NEAR EAST.      Towards the end of the meeting, Lord Balfour*s draftlord Balfour&apos;s despatch to the French Government, in regard to theDraft despatch to the French situation in the Near East, was received and read by theGovernment.Prime Minister, who stated that he fully concurred in it.LORD BALFOUR said he thought the best plan would be toshow this to M, Schanzer,2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,July 3,  1922.
