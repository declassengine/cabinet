ftROTE Bi I;S.  OhliMBEELAIii OF A OCljyRESAT 101; Y/ITE TEE ROOMIE IAhOEABOE D&apos;.AAE^IRES Oil SAilEJPJjAY MOEEIEG,    16th September,  1922;.In pursuance of a telephonic conversation with Lord.Ourzon who had returned to Hackwood,  the Prime Minister and Mr.Chamberlain saw the Roumanian Charge&quot; drAffaires this morning.The Prime Minister opened the conversation by sayingthat the complete defeat of the Greeks In Asia Minor had madea radical change In the situation.      As long as the question a tissue was confined to Anatolia, Roumania was but indirectlyinfluenced,  but ICemal flushed with his victory over the Greekswas now proclaiming his Intention of seizing Constantinople andthe Straits and of re-occupying Eastern Thrace and Adrianople.This obviously affected the immediate interests of Roumania andhis Majesty&apos;s Government were anxious to know what were the viewsof the Roumanian Government and what they were prepared to do.The Roumanian Charge&quot; dhtiffaires said that he had been somuch impressed with the urgency of the position that he had telegraphed four times to Bucharest to  ask for instructions andhad then gone so  far as to suggest on his  own motion that theoccasion called for military co-operation.     He had received no reply as yet, communication was now slow,  one radio message hadtaken three days in transmission and all his telegrams arrived in a mutilated, condition.     He did not know whether the fault wasin Bucharest or in Paris.      (He seemed to imply that it was inParis)  but he was now communicating by British lines viaConstantinople.     Ee was therefore without instructions and couldonly express a personal opinion;    but tie question of the Straitswas vital to roumania.      For Roumania it was not so much a
question of the Straits as a question of Russia.     Rouniania wasaccessible by sea if the Straits were opened and she could drawher necessary supplies from England.,  a sea power.      Had the Straitsbeen open she would never have suffered the reverse which fellupon her at the earlier stages of her intervention in the war.With the Straits closed she was like a man suffocating in his owngold.      She had no outlet for her exports.      Speaking, therefore for himself and again emphasising that he could only offer a personal opinion he considered the freedom of the Straits to be of vitalRoumanian interest and he was confident that Roumania would co-operate in its defence if asked.She Prime Minister made some reference to Bulgaria.     TheRoumanian Charge d&apos;Affaires said that he had just received atelegram from his Government that they had information that Bulgariawas already in communication both with. Moscow and with the (Turks andhad even issued a secret order of mobilisation,  and he was directed to enquire of the Foreign Office whether we had any information onthe subject and what action we propose to take.     Pie went on to saythat he had had. a feeling that the British Government had refrained from approaching the Roumanian Government officially hitherto lestit should be thought that we were seeking by Intrigue to separateEoumania from Prance, but that there could be no foundation forthis suspicion since the original proposal for Roumanian military co-operation-operation had been made by Mr. lake Jonescu when Minister in theearly months of the year to Mr. Lloyd George.     He could not, ofcourse, speak with authority for the present Government, but for himself,  speaking unofficially, he was confident that they wouldbe ready to co-operate with their military forces if that wasconsidered desirable.The Prime Minister said there was no question of separatingRoumania from Prance.     We understood that the attituS-e of the prench Government in Hie present situation and without prejudice tothe ultimate settlement was the same as our own.     They and theItalians had already sent a contingent to chanak and were sendingcontingents to the Ismid Peninsula.    We ourselves had determined to send at once additional support to the -Bri bish
-s- 20 british General at Constantinople and were taking the necessary(Jsteps to prepare additional troops.    We should propose to theFrench, and we hoped and believed that they would agree, to join with us in sending these reinforcements.      Our Minister atBucharest had already been instructed to speak in this sense tothe Roumanian Government and we reqxzested the Charge &amp;&apos;Affairesto telegraph to Monsieur Bratiano an account of this conversationwith us and to ask for a reply at his very earliest convenienceas to the measure of co-operation which the Roumanian Government wouldgive.    In concluding the interview we emphasised the fact that wewere not contemplating any forward movement against the Kamalists but merely such measures as were required to carry out for the time beingthe policy upon which the French and British Governments were agreedof prohibiting the entry of the Kemalists into Thrace or any attack bythem upon Gallipoli, Ghanak and that part of the Ismid Peninsula atpresent held by the Allied Forces.      The Roumanian Charge d&apos;Affairesagain said that he was confident that his Government would co-operate and that Roumania was in a position to send military assistance more rapidly than any other Power since, if he rightly remembered, a fastvessel could proceed from Costanza to Constantinople in 12 hours.    he asked and obtained leave to send his enquiry as a personal message from the Prime Minister to Monsieur Bratiano.    This would secure immed-iate attention and an earlier reply.     We asked him to secure theearliest possible reply and subsequently arranged with Sir William yrrell that the latter should arrange priority for his massage over british lines.After the departure of the Roumanian Minister we asked sir william Tyrrell to come over from the Foreign Office.    We gave himan account of our interview with the Roumanian Minister and he under-took to see about telegraphic facilities.   We also asked him to tele-graph to Lord Hardinge to invite Monsieur lintcic who is understoodflow to be in Paris to come over to London to confer with theBritish Government.
