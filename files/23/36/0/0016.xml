After some preliminary discussion duringwhich the Prime Minister explained that he hadsummoned this meeting to compare notes as to thepresent position in regard to German Reparations,which was to be discussed half-an-hour later withrepresentatives of the Allies, the PRIME MINISTERread .a personal message which he had received fromthe German Chancellor, dated Augist 5th, 1922(Appendix),SIR.JOHN BRADBURY agreed with the PrimeMinister that Dr.v/irthls statement was a very fairone.     He.;agreed with what Br,.Firth said aboutdeliveries&apos;in hind.       He thought that the-1-
German Government had been inclined to over-estimate the capacity of Germany for delivery in kind.THE 1033 PHIYY SEAL raised the question of howGfsraah wages compared with British wages.     M,Theunishad said that the British wages in the coal industry were the lowest in Europe.SHE CnAITCEIhOH OP THE E2CEEQUEB said that british coal was actually going to Germany because in some partsof Germany it was cheaper to &quot;buy British than German coal,SHE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that this was perhapsdue to sea transport.SIR JOHN BRADBURY said that after the Armistice,German wages had been very low and there had been a gooddeal of distress, hut matters had then   improved and upto three or four months ago wages had gone ahead of therise in prices.     How, however, prices were going ahead of wages.     He  id not think, however, that there was muchreal distress among the Gorman working classes.MRiLEITH ROBS,is reply to the Prime Minister, saidthat it was very difficult to estimate the purchasing valueof wages in Germany as compared with Great Britain.     the purchasing power of the mark varied with every day4      Atpresent, however, prices were going steadily against wages.After same exchange of views as to the amounts already paid by Germany and their economic effect, the PRIME ministers aid that the two questions which he.d to be considered were first, at what stage would the Allies be justified intaking a step which would upset the German Government andparalyse the German administration and internal economy, and second, whether it was worth while taking such steps.3/ahitehall Gardens, 3,v,97th August. 192-8
APPEHPIZPersonal message from the German Chancellor toUr.Lloyd George, communicated &quot;by the german ambassador, August 5th, 1928.Within a few weeks conditions in Germany have funda-nientally deteriorated.     This deterioration of the   economicsituation has been accompanied by a growing crisis in thepolitic;?.! situation.      Owing to the unbearable rise in pricesan extraordinary exasperation has seized large  actions ofthe population.      It is commonly alleged that the . catastrophic .condition of the German exchange and the general pauperisationand misery is due to the governmentJs &quot;policy of fulfilment&quot;,which, it is said, has exceeded the limits of possibility.This exasperation of the people can unfortunately not be ignored and it constitutes a fact, -which must be seriously considered by the German government.     The most extensivemeasures of precaution cannot preclude the possibility c further political assassinations.      In view of this growingexasperation a further delay in the solution of the Reparationquestion would bo fatal;    social and political upheavals couldscarcely be avoided.      I am personalia conscious of tremendousresponsibilities and have, therefore,  consistently followed the policy of fulfilment within the last year:    AcknowledgingGermany1s liabilities I have patiently borne all demands, socruel to the German -people, in the hope of bettor times tocome.      But to-day it is no more a question of patience but ofexhaustion.In my opinion it is the German democratic government,which, after the catastrophe of the war, has saved thebourgeois society of Central Europe from Bolshevism, and has\atherefore, from the point of view of history, deserved wellof the world social order.     a policy looking to Europe as a
whole can, however, not be continued in face of thecomplete pauperisation of the German people.I desire to draw attention to the fact that, shouldthe present fall in the exchange continue, delivories in kind will shortly have to ho restricted, as it would become impossible to finance them internally.      In-any ease the deliveries of coal imposed up on us are excessive and cannot he continued.     However, I will exert the greatest energyto continue the present line., of Gorman policy, but thispolicy,  I am bound to state, will collapse, cM ng to the plain fact of the depreciation of the mark, unless externalhelp is given in time.      I must emphasise our &quot;non possumus1&apos;as far as payments in gold and exorbitant deliveries in coalare concerned.The German democracy is doomed unless a stop can. be.;ut to the further pauperisation of the German people,She laments of all members of the middle classes, who have become beggars owing to the currency depreciation, is indefe-cribahlo,      I must therefore implore you -(!) Not to allow the evident evolution of theReparation question towards a solution to hedisturbed by forcible measures calculatedutterly to ruin the finance and economic strength of  Germany.(S) To work towards a. reduction of Reparationsto figures definitely bearable by the Germannational economy, towards allowing Germanysufficient breathing space to consolidateher utterly ruined exchange and thus tocreate the only basis of German economicefficiency.I venture to address this forcible exposition of thesituation to Mr.,Lloyd George as conscientious deliberationshave convinced me that this is the last decisive moment.
