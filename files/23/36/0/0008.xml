0 71/&apos;British. Secretary1 s JKotes of a Meeting heldv.,48 at 10, Downing Street. Jierdon, S.W./1 onMonday, March B7th, 1922 at 5.0 p.m.Present;-British. UmpireMr. Lloyd George, accompanied bySir Maurice Hankey andSir Edward Grigg;&apos; &apos; ItalyMo Sohaaasr, accompanied byMarques Yisoohti Venosta andMo Giannini.1. MRo. LLOYD Gf!0RCE said that he had heard thai? the ForelgaMinisters had made very good progress alf Paris,M, SCHAHZBR said he was very well satisfied with themeeting.MR,  LLOYD GEORGE asked if they had made prsace.M. SCHANZEE said that they had drawn up very fair terms in reply to the Prime Minister, he said they had provided forthe protection of the Christian races.MR. LLOYD GEORGE said that he had less confidence Inthe lurks than had some other peoplei     It would be a horriblething if a new mass&amp;ar-e broke out.I&amp;8CA. 2.     MR. LLOYD GEORGE said that the next Conference was at genoa. That was very largely M, Sohanzer&apos;s business. Hohimself would do his very best to support him in the Chair.&apos; M. SCRAHZER said that Mo Paota had charged him to make his excuses for not being able to visit the Prime Minister,but he had been very busy in Rome.     M. Pacta would be at
 Genoa at the outset of the Conference and would preside at the opening meeting. It was probable, however, since he was President of the Assembly that he might be called to Rome. M. Schanzer asked if it was Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s idea that he himself should take the Chair when M. Facta was called away. He was willing to do so if desired.

MR. LLOYD GEORGE said he certainly thought that this was the proper arrangement. He asked if M. Lenin was expected to come to the Conference.

M. SCHANZER said that M. Lenin was reported to be ill and it was doubtful if he could come.

MR. LLOYD GEORGE said he wished M. Lenin could come as he felt the Allies might make peace with him. He was less certain in regard to M. Chicherin, who had sent a very impertinent message to M. Schanzer.

ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE CONFERENCE.

3. M. SCHANZER asked if it was necessary to raise the question of the Agenda again? As it had been accepted at Cannes he thought it was not.

MR. LLOYD GEORGE agreed that it was unnecessary.

M. SCHANZER than asked Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s views as to the arrangements for the Conference.

MR. LLOYD GEORGE said it would be very useful if a day before the Conference opened, the convening Powers might meet and have a discussion. They might arrive on the evening of the 8th and have a discussion on the 9th. in regard to the general arrangements for the Conference. He asked if M. Schanzer would be passing through Paris on his return?

M. SCHANZER said he would be unable to stop, but he could arrange this meeting with the other Governments concerned, by telegram.

MR. LLOYD GEORGE said that if that could be arranged, he himself would try and see M. Poincaré on his way through Paris.

M. SCHANZER said he had spoken to M. Poincaré on the previous day and found he was now disposed to come to Genoa.


MR. LLOYD GEORGE said he hoped M. Poincaré would come, at any rate at the outset. He had had quite an  amicable talk with M. Poincaré at Boulogne. He understood that M. Schanzer had received a copy of the procès verbal.

M. SCHANZER replied that this was the case. He understood that it had been arranged at Boulogne that certain subjects should be excluded, for example, Peace Treaties, Reparations, and Armaments. As Chairman of the Genoa Conference he apprehended that someone might speak on these questions. He himself felt it was impossible absolutely to exclude all reference to them.

MR. LLOYD GEORGE recalled that at Boulogne he had told M. Poincaré clearly that in his view it was impossible to prevent a speaker from saying that reparations or the Treaties of Peace produced such and such an effect   and that in these circumstances the effect of certain measures would be limited.

M. SCEANZER said that he himself had pointed out to M. Barrère that in his view it was impossible absolutely to exclude all reference to the barred subjects.

MR. LLOYD GEORGE said he did not think that M. Poincaré would take an extreme view on this subject. Of course, he would not agree to any alterations in the terms of the Treaties, but he could not prevent all mention of the Treaties, or prohibit a speaker from saying that the effect of the Treaties on the exchange, for example, was so and so.

ORGANISATION OF THE GENOA CONFERENCE.

4. M. SCHANZER said he would like to have a word about the organisation of the Genoa Conference. He proposed that there should not be many Plenary Sessions, but that most of the business should be done in Committee.

MR. LLOYD GEORGE agreed.

M. SCHAN2ER proposed that the Conference should open with a speech of welcome from M. Facta. Then should follow the appointment of the President and after this the Conference


should proceed with the constitution of Committees..ME. LLOYD GEORGE said he thought it was desirable thatthere should be a general expression of the reasons for theConference by the representatives of Prance and Great Britain.In moving and seconding the appointment of the President,they might discuss the scope of the Conference.M.  SCHAJSZiSR said he would be very grateful for this.In this event he did not see how they could avoid the Germanand Russian representatives speaking also.     This would mean a very long debate.ME- LLOYD GEORGE said he did not mind the German and russian representatives speaking but what he feared was thatthe speeches would be extended through all the nations toAlbania and Luxembourg.    ; He thought It would be useful ifthe Russian and German representatives had an opportunity to speak.      The Conference would get to know where the.Russiansstood.      It would be, so-to-spsak, a reconnaissance - in force.M.  SCHA&amp;ZER asked how&apos;, in that event, the ether rationscould be excluded from speaking?. MR. -LLOYD GEORGE said that M. Cleim-nceau used to surmount,the difficulty by rising and anuouncing,T&apos;La seance est levee&quot;.He admitted, however, that the difficulty was very consider-able.     However,  it would be most useful to know where theRussians stood at the outset of the Conference and a general discussion would be   T^sefui     which would bring this out.M. SCHAHZEB said, he contemplated the establishment offive Committees.     First, a Political Committee, to be corn-posed of Prime Ministers and Foreign Ministers;      a secondCommittee,  especially for Russia, to be presided over by aBritish Delegate;    a third Committee for financial Affairs-,with a French President;    a fourth for Economic A.ffairs., witha -Belgian President, and a fifth for Trans it,with a JapanesePresident, making five Committees in all.      If Mr, Lloyd George
thought it   e&amp;sontial to have a debate in &quot;Plenary session in which the Russian representatives should take part, hethought there would be a difficulty.     Would it not bebetter to transfer the debate to the Committees?MR.LLOYD GEORGE suggested that the Political and theRussian Committees should not be separate, but it was essen-tial to have a general agreement as to the lines 6n whichthe Conference was to travol and this subject must be dealtwith by the Heads of delegations,M. SCHAiiSER asked if Mr. Lloyd ^eorge meant that itwas difficult to separate tne Russian Committee from thePolitical Committee?MR, LLOYD GEORGE agreed that this was his view.   Apartfrom Russia, the main part of the Conference would befinancial and economic, but the question of Russia raisedgreat political issues.      The first thing was for the membersof the Conference to clear their minds as to what they wereaiming at.     Was it exclusively financial or partly political?Ho-one would advance money until peace was established inEurope.     So long as great ilueaian and Polish armies existed,no-one would advance money.     Hence, the Conference mustknow what it was driving at.     He would describe their objec-tive as peace in iSurope.     Por example, Russia must recognisethat Bessarabia was part of Roumanian   the RusscvPolishfrontiers must be recognised;    the Karelian boundary mustbe fixed.     All these questions must be settled and then the nations must be induced not to attack each other.     Other-wise, there could be no economic restoration.M.  SCRAHSER asked if Mr. Lloyd George thought thesepolitical questiens could be settled in Conference.MR. LLOYD GEORGE replied not in Blencory Conference,but in Committees.
M. asked if his view was:that the wholeRussian problem should be brought before the Political Com-mittee.MR. LLOYD-GEORGE replied in the affirmative.      The thing to be sure of was that there should be.no fighting betweenthe various Statesj .&apos;.&quot;&apos;&apos;M-. SCHANZER asked if Mr. Lloyd George, would proposeto begin with a general statement?MR. 110YD GEORGE replied that, the Russian delegation were coming without knowing exactly what the&apos; Conference was for and he thought some of the Allies were in the same position,Hence,  it would be useful to give a general explanation.,Perhaps M. P&amp;cta could do this,M, SCHANZER thought it would %e better for       Factsto reserve himself and&apos;&apos; for Mr. lloyd ^eorge to make this declaration.MR. LLOYD.GEORGE said that he could propose andM. Poincare could second the moving of M. Facts into the Chair.They &quot;could take this opportunity to make general statement.- -       ...... pei Laps.M.  SCRAfiZER said in that event M. Pacts mirhVc onlinehimself to an address of welcome-.  MR. lloyd GEORGE said that, if M. Schanzer preferred,M.&apos; Poincare could make a general statement,M. SCHAHSER said it was essential that Mr. Lloyd Georgeshould speak,MR. LLOYD GEORGE said that he would speak also.M.  SCHASZER-asked if-the Germans and Russians would alsospeak?MR. LLOYD GEORGE replied in the affirmative.      It wasnecessary to know where their Delegates stood.      It might benecessary to talk very straight to the Russians at - the outset of the Conference.
M. SCHANZER asked if the Committees would then be appointed?

MR. LLOYD GEORGE replied in the affirmative, but only after a general explanation of the scope of the Conference had been given.

M. SCHANZER asked if Mr. Lloyd George contemplated four instead of five Committees? If so, the four Committees could be presided, over by the representatives of the Great Powers. This would mean leaving Belgium out.

MR. LLOYD GEORGE pointed out that in any event it would be difficult to give, a Chair to a Belgian representative and not to Roumania or Czecho-Slovakia.

M. SCHANZER asked if the Political Committee should be presided over by an Italian Delegate?

MR. LLOYD GEORGE replied that he certainly thought this should be the case.

M. SCHANZER asked if matters could not be arranged so that the Russian question should be the only question  before the Political Committee?

MR. LLOYD GEORGE pointed out that this could not be the case. The French Government, it was true, had limited discussion to a oonsiderable extent, but how was it possible to reconstruct Europe without mentioning Russia?

M. SCHANZER pointed out that the question of Austrian Relief had hithe to been dealt with by the League of Nations and might perhaps be excluded from the Genoa Conference.

MR. LLOYD GEORGE pointed out that the question of the exchanges was also very important.         SUBSTITUTE DELEGATES. 

5. M. SCHANZER asked whether Mr. Lloyd George would agree to the appointment of substitute Delegates. The work in committee might require Ministers who were not Delegates.


MIL  LLOYD GEORGE said he was entirely in favour of this..There wore some questions on which he might like to he repre-sented by a Minister who was not a member of the Delegation,M. SCEAHZER thought that a certain elasticity was desir-able.      He said he had prepared a draft of certain rules ofprocedure.      he suggested that there should be no debate inregard to tha.se, hut they should be declared by the Chairman.If they ware brought before the Plenary Session, they wouldinvolve a long debate.MR. LLOYD GEORGE agreed.      It was important not to spinout the Conference too much.M.   SCHAUZER thought a month was the extreme limit.MA-  LLOYD GEORGE agreed that it should not last longer,,There might,  it was true, be a good deal to settle afterwards.It was necessary in the first instance to declare the policyand then to leave the exports to work out the details,6.     M.  SCHA1JZER said that an outstanding question related to the League of Nations, which was anxious to co-operate at genoa by sending experts,      for example, from its financialand economic organisations and from the Labour Bureau.      they wanted to send two or three experts from each.     ^e thought this might be accepted on the understanding that they werenot there as Delegates but merely as advisers.MR. LLOYD GEORGE agreed.     ^e said that as the Conferencecontinued,  it would be found that the business was done ininformal talks rather than at the main Conference.     AtCannes there had been very valuable informal talks with the^ermans and Russians.      The Russians would, no doubt, putforward proposals,and someone would have to see them,      The
0 same applied to the Germans.      If we worked together, he believed that uenoa could be made the greatest of all the conferences.M.  SCHAIiZEB said that it would be Mr. Lloyd ^eorgelswork. -. .       MR. LLOYD GEORGE replied that it would not be his, butthe work of all.M, SCHAMZER referred to a recent speech he had made inthe Italian Parliament controverting those who had belittledthe value of the Genoa Conference and stating that it wouldbe the most Important of all.      This had been very well received.  . \-ME.  LLC YD GiSOHGE said he heard that all parties had wel-oomed the statement.M.   SCHABZEB said that this was the case.      He had statedclearly that certain subjects would be excluded and this hadnot evoked any protests from the Labour Party.PSBSONHEL&quot; OF   6.     ME, LLOYD GEORGE said he would like M. Schanzer to thirkSUTTEES.out whether at the outset there should not be a general dis-discussion.     Another difficulty related to  she establishmentof the Committees, and the representation en them cf thesmaller Powers.M. SCHABZER said he thought It was impossible to exclude the/smaller Powers and that thsy must be allowed to have one repre-sentative each en all Committees.MR.  LLOYD GEORGE said this would mean Committees of overthirty.M. SCHAHZER asked if it was possible from the democraticpoint s/f view to exclude thetn?MR. LLOYD GEORGE agreed that it was difficult, but he asked if it was possible to give the smaller Powers the samerepresentation as the Great Powers.      He was thinking rf thequestion of time.
M. SCHANZER said, he feared it would produce a bad effect if the small Powers were ruled out of the Committees.

SIR MAURICE HANKEY suggested that one plan would be to have the small Powers represented on the main  Committees which would then delegate most of the work to Sub-Committees selected according to expert competence rather than nationality.

Mr LLOYD GEORGE asked how it would be possible to get the business done with such large Committees? With 30  members there would be endless debates.

M. SCHANZER said his experience was that the representatives of the smaller Powers did not speak, very much. He appealed to Sir Maurice Hankey to support this, from his experience at Washington.

SIR MAURICE HANKEY pointed out that the debates at Washington had been somewhat protracted, and that the Conference had lasted about three months.

Mr LLOYD GEORGE pointed out that at the League of Nations the real business was done by the Council, which was a small body on which the small Powers were not all represented. He suggested that the Committees might be composed as follows:-

The Convening Powers (2 Delegates each)... 10

Germany ..................................  1

Russia ...................................  1

The Little Entente .......................  1

Neutrals .................................  1

                              TOTAL ...... 14

M. SCHANZER said the Baltic States would expect to have a,representative.

Mr LLOYD GEORGE suggested that the Baltic States might go with the Little Entente. If there were four Committees, each constituted on this principle, it would give a fair representation to the smaller States.

M. SCHANZER said he did not oppose this view, but he was afraid the small Powers would not accept it.


THE MARQUESS VISCONTI VENOSTA suggested that the representation of the smaller Powers could be distributed between the four Committees.

M. SCHANZER said that if certain States were excluded from the Political Committee they would protest.

THE MARQUESS VISCONTI VENOSTA suggested that there might be five representatives of the smaller States in each Committee so that all would be represented somewhere.

M. SCHANZER said that in that event questions would rarely be transferred from the Committees to the Plenary Session, where Powers which had been excluded would wish to ventilate their views.

Mr LLOYD GEORGE asked M. Schanzer to consider what was the object of the Committees. If every State was to be represented on every Committee he did not see what object there was in establishing them. No business could be transacted in such large bodies, and he wanted to get through the business at Genoa expeditiously. At Washington there had been plenty of time, and the Americans had not minded how long the Conference was kept going. That was impossible in Europe, at the present time. Consider the Political Committee, for example. The larger States would require, to be represented by their Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary. If all, the other States were represented it would form a regular Parliament. He was inclined to agree with the Marquess Visconti Venosta that the smaller States should be distributed; so as to obtain representation on one or other of the  Committees. If necessary, a new Committee might be created to absorb, some of them. He recalled that at the Paris Peace Conference it had often been necessary to ask the smaller States to agree to elect two  representatives for a number of them. He admitted, however, that this had sometimes formed the object of protests.


M. SCHANZER said the small States would make adverse comparisons between the Genoa Conference and the League of Nations, where they were all represented.

Mr LLOYD GEORGE said that this was one of the reasons why the League of Nations had not accomplished more.

M. SCHANZER said it might be possible to make, an exception in the case of the Political Committee, and to confine representation thereon to the Great Powers.

Mr LLOYD GEORGE suggested that in addition there should be one representative for Neutrals and one for the Little Entente.

M. SCHANZER summed, up that the Political Committee might be composed as follows:-

The Convening Powers ........ 2 Delegates each.

Germany ..................... 1 Delegate.

Russia ...................... 1 Delegate.

The Little Entente and

    Baltic States ........... 1 Delegate.

Neutrals .................... 1 Delegate.

The matter could be finally decided, however, the day before the Genoa Conference opened.

Mr LLOYD GEORGE agreed.

(7) He would be very glad if the Convening Powers could meet the day before the Genoa Conference opened, in order to discuss the procedure. He understood that the arrangement at present contemplated was that M. Facta should make a general statement of welcome, M. Poincaré should make a speech, which would, necessarily be from  his own point of view, while he made a speech from another point of view. He thought that it would be a good thing if this were followed by a general discussion. He would not mind devoting the first day, or even two days, to this. Let all the States have their say; then they would not feel they had come to Genoa for nothing.

M. SCHANZER agreed that it would be useful to obtain the different political points of view.

Mr LLOYD GEORGE said that if he and M. Schanzer changed their minds they could arrange matters at the proposed 
 preliminary meeting.

M. SCHANZER said he would put Mr Lloyd George&apos;s suggestion to M. Facta.

Mr LLOYD GEORGE said he would like to have the preliminary meeting on April 9th. He would like Belgium to he represented there. The meeting might be composed of the representatives of the Convening States, namely, 

Italy, Great Britain, France, Japan, Belgium. The meeting should be held on the 9th, for preliminary discussion on procedure, and should be informal in character.

M. SCHANZER said he would inform the other States.

THE MARQUESS VISCONTI VENOSTA suggested that perhaps they should not be informed too soon, as it might awaken jealousy in other states.

Mr LLOYD GEORGE suggested that M. Schanzer should let France know informally.

M. SCHANZER said he would take the opportunity of M. Jaspar&apos;s visit to Rome to let the Belgians know also.

Mr LLOYD GEORGE urged that this should be done informally.

THE MARQUESS VISCONTI VENOSTA suggested that the newspapers should not be informed.

Mr LLOYD GEORGE agreed. This preliminary, conference should be informal in character. He asked when it was proposed to open the Genoa Conference, on the morning or the afternoon of the Monday? If everything was got ready on the Sunday and general agreement was reached, he thought it might be in the morning: otherwise, in the afternoon.

M. SCHANZER asked if Mr Lloyd George had any more suggestions to make?

Mr LLOYD GE0RGE said he wanted to have a business Conference at Genoa.

After some short further discussion, in which M. SCHANZER again made allusion to the comparisons that the smaller States would make between the Genoa Conference and the League of Nations, the proceedings terminated.
