NOTE 017 A CONVERSATION AT 10, DOWNING STREET.JULY 5TH 1922.The following is a re cored of a luncheon table  con-versation dictated from short notes put down immediatelyafterwards.      Kt times there were two  conversations pro-ceeding simultaneously,  between the Prime Minister andMr. Taft at one end of the table,  and between the LordChancellor and the American Ambassador at the other, Mr.Churchill end Mr. Bonar Law,  who were  seated midway,  taking part at intervals in both.      It is therefore not possibleto give more than the general purport of the talk,  butboth Mr. Taft and Mr. Harvey pressed, the  same line of argument,There were present:-BRITISH. AMERICAN.The Prime Minister, Mr. Taft,The Lord Chancellor. Colonel Harvey.Mr. chuirchill.Mr. Bon ar Law.Sir Edward Grigg.The conversation on European affairs began with some discussion of the war and of the Peace Conference which hadno direct bearing upon the politics of the moment.      ThePrime Minister,prompte&amp; by a remark of Mr. Taft1 s.thenpointed out how seriously the whole European settlement hadbeen affected, by the withdrawal of the United. States.      Heshowed that the working of the League of Nations depended&apos;very greatly upon American participation and asked Mr, Tafttowards participationwhether American opinion was becoming more favourable /in it.Mr. Taft said that the der.iocra.ts we re of course arguiua:
in favour of the League and that there were signs of interestin it on the part of the American farmers, not on any idealistgrounds but mainly on a calculation regarding the price of,and the markets for wheat.      It was true that the RepublicanParty showed considerable signs of division;    but the differences arose from internal and not external, questions.The Republican Party as a. whole had. not  changed very muchin its attitude towards the League.The    grime Minister begged Mr. Taft to forgive him ifhe spoke very frankly about the American attitude.     he himself had never felt more anxious about the Europeansituation.      Austria had reached the point of collapse,  and it now seemed inevitable that Germany would reach it.Some discussion followed regarding the German situation,Mr. Bonar Law maintaining that the complete collapse of the mark in Germany had long been inevitable and would net necess-arily be attended by any serious convulsion.      The general,opinion at the table was, however,  against him.on this point.It was pointed out that Germany according to Dr. Rathena,u&apos;sstatement at&apos; Genoa now imported a third of the food-stuffsnecessary to maintain her population.      Her popu.la.tion was already very seriously underfed.      If it became impossibleto buy food-stuffs abroad owing to a collapse of German currencythere would be widespread starvation and very serious politicalt rouble.The Prime Minister emphasised this danger very strongly.Russia, he pointed out, was an unorganised country and couldthetherefore collapse without /terrible results which must follow in Germany.     The Russian people were moreover unpractical and rather indeterminate in character.     Revolution and Bolshevismwould be much more  serious in Germany.      It would be organisedthere by very practical and persevering people;    it would be
accompanied &quot;by terrible in dust rial and social upheaval ;and it would inevitably spread to other parts of theEuropean Continent and even beyond Europe.      He could notTemfc regard this situation with any thine but the gravestapprehension, and he had felt for some time that nothing could be done to avert or even to moderate the consequencesunless the United States consented to play some part in european affairs.      It was hue that Europe wanted Americanmoney^^&quot;lonerican people, no doubt, had excellent reasonsfor feeling that it was useless    to throw good money afterba.d.     He was quite prepared to accept that position, last St-ft-ce-money was not the main necessity.     The United States might do a great deal for Europe without lending a single centmore to any European people.      What was needed was herdetached and impartial, moral influence.      The effect of that,in bringing people to reason,  in prompting co-operation,and in cooling the fever of hatred which nor; burned in manyEuropean peoples, would be very considerable - indeed it wouldprobably be decisive,      17o one else.was in a position to exert the same influence.      Great Britain was doing her best,but she was a part of the European system, bound to it byroots and tendrils which had grown out of the history of ath ou s an d ye ar s *, ,/( Srance was almost beyond any appeal to reason and wouldcertainly respond to none at the present moment except possibly from the United States.      She was consumed by ahatred of Germany going back for 400 years.and she could notbelieve that the advice of other European powers was notprompted by some selfish interest.     This was riot the case
with advice coining from the United States.     The United states was in a position to act as an umpire or an arbitrator whoseimpartiality and goodwill/aopi-otaneefall Europe was ready to admit.      He &quot;begged Mr.Taft to forgive him for speaking strongly but he felt thatA.history would lay/great    responsibility on the people of theUnited States if they continued to  cut themselves off ah-solutely and to deny all responsibility for the settlementof problems created by a war in which their parti cipation hadbeen so great and so decisive.Mr. Taft said that he thanked the Prime Minister forspeaking frankly and said that he would repeat the conversationin quarters where lie thought it might be useful to do so.Colonel Harvey then asked why we were not sending overntfee delegation in response to the American invitation to arrange for the funding of our debt.      He felt that theattitude of the American Administration on this subject had beenmisunderstood.      The invitation to Great Britain to come overfirst had not been accidental;    it was,  on the contrary, very seriously meant.     What the Administration wanted to do was. to make common action possible on the part of the United Statesand the British Empire by clearing- the debt between them outof the way,  and thus enabling them to stand together as theonly creditor lowers in the world in dealing v/ith the rest.This wa,s the essential ba,sis of Anglo-American co-operation in dealing with the problems of Europe.      The Administrationwere tied hand and. foot in the matter until the British debt to America was cleared out of the way.     When once that was done,however,  co-operation would be easy and, he thought,  fruitful.The    two Powers with their immense joint influence would bestanding on the same platform and able to adopt a. common policyfcowa.rds all the nations in need of help.     He could not understand why we had allowed the French to send Delegation
which, was now on the sea)while we ourselves had done nothingas yet.     This would certainly he misunderstood in theUnited states;    had feeling and suspicion wculd he createdover there;    and a great opportunity for Anglo-american co-operation would be lost.     It woald he thought that wehad deliberately refused an invitation from the administration to come over ahead of the other European peoples and todiscuss the whole situation with America tete-a-tete.     Hewas most emphatic in repeating that this would be a disastrousblunder^if he might be allowed to say so, and that a greatopportunity was being lost.Some conversation followed between Mr. Bonar Law and colonel Harvey regarding the funding of the debt, in which other members of the party at intervals took part.     I havenot been able to make a note of the details of this discussion,fccJtbut in substance,  Colonel Harvey maintained/when once the debt was funded at,  say, the backing of the British and american Governments would make it the finest security inthe world, and would secure so great an appreciation that /Ckreal interest charge^ upon this country would  s^jUsm fall to anything from 2 to 2faffy     He also maintained that theBritish and American Governments could do as they pleasedin putting the bonds upon the market and could even make arrangements for postponing this operation, if necessary,to a later date.At the same time, Mr. Taft was engaged in a conversationwith the prime Minister regarding the next CongressionalElection in the first week of November.     He discussed thetheprospect^ of a7 Republican Party and gave it as his opinion/that the Republicans would certainly receive a very severeshaking, even if Democratic majority were not actuallyelected to the House.      whatever happened, however, he was
convinced that the character of the Congress would be con-siderably changed,  and he gave the Ptime Minister to under-stand that the Administration would have a special oppor-tunity of dealing with difficult questions in the threemonths&apos; session left to the old Congress before the beginningof March when it ceased to exist.     I was not able to^catchthe whole of his argument on this point, but I gather/thatthe old congress,  during that period,  containing as itwould many Members who had lost their seats, would be either more indifferent or more accommodating than thepresent congress,  and that the Administration might thus be enabled to get measures through which would not havebeen practicable at any other time.Colonel Harvey came into the discussion at this point and endorsed Mr. Taft&apos;s view.      In reply to a remark from,one of the British members of the party that the fundinglegislation was in any case fixed, he said that this wasnot necessarily so.      A Commission had been appointed todeal with the funding question.      They might very well reportto the Administration that funding was not practicable without some amendment of the law passed last Session,  and the Ad-ministration might then be able to bring in further legis-lation on the funding question before March.     Mr. Taftconcurred,  and argued very strongly that the present op-port unity of dealing with the funding problem should not be lost,  since time was really short before the new Congresscame into existence after the first week of March.Colonel Harvey once more repeated his appeal to theHrime Minister to send over a Delegation to fund the debtat once.      He insisted that the invitation to Great britain to come first was not put in merely as a matter of conveniencebut was most expressly advised in order to facilitate co-opera-tion with Great Britain in dealing with the rest of the world.
He said that he regarded this whole question as very-critical in its bearing on Anglo-American relations.They could take a great step forward if the BritishGovernment met the American Government and sent feh-e Dele-gat ion over at once.     If they failed to do so, he tmx&amp;nmifeared that the misunderstanding which would result wouldbe disastrous.     The French, he repeated, were already onthe way to America.     It was true that they were not goingto do anything except argue their inability to pay, butthat was not the point.     They would have respondedinmediately to the American invitation, whilst we who hadbeen asked to come over first would not have respondedat all.      It was really a crucial moment in Anglo-american relations, and he could not see why the British delegation was not sent at once.     He explained,  of course, that hewas speaking very frankly and informally as the PrimeMinister also had done.
