outside India. He was told there were technical difficulties in this, but that they could be overcome by Act of Parliament. In view of the present exceptional difficulties in India, he thought that the Viceroy should have the help of the best political minds that could be obtained.

LORD PEEL, referring to the technical difficulties, said the present rule was that three members of the Viceroy&apos;s Council must have at least ten years in the service of the Crown in India. Of course the Viceroy had not had such service and the Commander-in-Chief would only occasionally have it. Neither had the three Indian Members of the Council.

THE PRIME MINISTER said he was thinking of the appointment of Ministers without Portfolio.

LORD PEEL said that there would be certain difficulties in this. They would be men without administrative experience in India, and there would be a certain amount of feeling owing to the disturbance of the proportions between the British and Indian representation on the Council.

SIR MALCOLM HAILEY said that at present there were three Indian Members of the Council and three British besides the Commander-in-Chief.

LORD PEEL said that if two more British members were added the question would be raised as to whether the position of the Indian Members of the Council was not being weakened. The question of finance would also be raised.

THE PRIME MINISTER asked what was the pay of a Member of the Indian Council, converted into pounds sterling?

SIR MALCOLM HAILEY said if was £6,000 a year. In reply to the Prime Minister, he said the total budget was about £80,000,000 a year.

LORD PEEL added that if money could be obtained it was urgently required for improving the position of the Indian Civil Service. He reverted to an idea that had been




 discussed that Sir Malcolm Hailey should nove to the home Department and that someone should be sent from home to take his place in India. Proposals had been made that some competent City men should be selected, but it was very difficult to obtain such, as they were already doing too well. Suggestions had also been made that an official in the India Office should go to India. He pointed out that there were a number of very competent men in the Indian Civil Service itself. Consequently, anyone who was sent out would have to be a really first-rate man.

THE PRIME MINISTER said he did not see how the Viceroy could govern such a huge country with only two or three advisers, in these difficult times. In the British Cabinet there were such men as Lord Balfour, Lord Curzon, Mr. Chamberlain and Mr. Churchill, who had immense experience. All this was required, and even then mistakes were sometimes made. In India there were, no doubt, a number of able, competent men, but he did not think the Viceroy had all the assistance he required. If he himself were in such a position he would feel he wanted every possible assistance.

LORD PEEL said that the difficulties of the present time were, no doubt, greater than formerly, but a number of very considerable questions had been decentralised from the Central Government to the Provincial Governments.

THE PRIME MINISTER said it was a question of decision and policy. On matters of policy it was necessary to have someone with whom the Viceroy could talk them over again and again before coming to a decision. He did not see how the Viceroy could be expected to govern without this.

LORD PEEL recalled that the Heads of Departments in India nowadays not only occupied the position of permanent officials at the head of Departments, but they also had to go into the Parliamentary arena.


THE PRINCE OF WALES said that his impression in India had been that men like Sir Malcolm Hailey had a great deal too much to do.

LORD PEEL said there had been some talk of appointing Under-Secretaries, but it was difficult to obtain suitable men. The representatives of the Government in the Indian Parliament were in much the same position as the representatives of the British Government in the House of Lords, who were the centre of attack from all quarters, with few supporters.

SIR MALCOLM HAILEY agreed that the Government of India wanted strengthening. The Indian representatives on the Council had no administrative experience. The Viceroy had to work a system which brought him into a position almost corresponding to that of the Prime Minister. What he felt was needed was a President of the Council, to undertake the heavy Departmental business which now came to the Viceroy, and to co-ordinate the Departmental business, thus relieving him for the consideration of larger questions of policy. A short time ago, for example, the Viceroy had needed to devote six or seven hours a day to the consideration of Afghan policy. This happened to coincide with a time when a number of difficult Departmental questions had arisen. To see the heads of Departments about these questions and to consider the larger questions of policy had been too much for any one man. Another difficulty arose from the presence of Indians on the Council.

LORD PEEL said that they could not be relied on to keep matters secret.

SIR MALCOLM HAILEY said that this might bring them to the position practically of having a Cabinet within a Cabinet. It was very difficult for the Indians, surrounded as they were by their relations and friends, not to mention


in conversation what had taken place at the Council. That was another reason for trying to obtain a President of the Council. The Viceroy had practically been obliged to deal with many questions in an inner Cabinet.

THE PRINCE OF WALES said it would not matter very much if the President of the Council had not had experience of Indian matters, provided that he was a man of affairs.

THE PRIME MINISTER agreed.

SIR MALCOLM HAILEY said that in the future it was necessary to envisage the possibility of an Indian Prime Minister. Then there was the question of the Native States.

LORD PEEL said that the Viceroy might with advantage have a Foreign Minister, too.

SIR MALCOLM HAILEY said that at present the Viceroy was entirely responsible for dealing with the Native States.

LORD PEEL thought it would be better to begin with only one additional adviser, namely, a President of the Executive Council.

SIR MALCOLM HAILEY agreed that it would be advisable only to appoint one at first. If he were a first-rate man he thought that no great objection would be raised, either on financial grounds or owing to the disturbance of the proportion between Indians and British on the Council. It would largely depend upon the personality of the individual.

LORD PEEL supposed that his salary would have to be larger than that of other members, to mark his position.

THE PRIME MINISTER felt it was essential that someone should be appointed to act as President of the Council and to co-ordinate the Departmental work, and thus relieve the Viceroy for larger questions of policy.

LORD PEEL said that at the same time it was necessary to have a real Viceroy, and under him a Prime Minister.


THE PRIME MINISTER said that in effect the President of the Council would be almost like a Prime Minister. The position would be rather similar to that in the United States of America, where, he understood, the present Secretary of State had a certain predominance. President Wilson had tried to be President and Prime Minister, with the result that the Departments had broken down and the President himself had broken down.

LORD PEEL said it was essential to have a Parliamentarian. 

THE PRIME MINISTER agreed. It was important to have someone trained in British Parliamentary ways.

LORD PEEL agreed in this, and said that the Indians were copying British Parliamentary customs, including some of the less desirable ones.

SIR MALCOLM HAILEY said that the officials had had to learn a new trade in order to deal with the Indian Parliament. Speeches at the present time inclined to be very long, but had been limited to half an hour to the mover of a resolution, and twenty minutes to other speakers. This did not apply, of course, in introducing the Budget, and such matters.

The Secretary of State for India, at the request of the Prime Minister, undertook, to prepare a Memorandum and to make proposals for strenghening the Viceroy&apos;s Council in the light of the above discussion.

Staff Assistance

THE PRIME MINISTER asked what sort of Staff assistance the Members of the Council and Heads of Departments had?

SIR MALCOLM HAILEY said that at present it was very primitive. They had no Private Secretary and were only allowed a Personal Assistant, who was usually a Native stenographer. He admitted that they even had to answer their own telephone calls, and they had no-one to fend off visitors, as people would come and sit on their door-step


 until they were admitted: The difficulty as regards having a Private Secretary was that the Indian Members would insist on the same privilege, and their Indian Private Secretaries would not, in all cases, be reliable. Usually they would insist on having a relative as Private Secretary. Consequently the matter had not been pressed as strongly as it would otherwise have been. This, however, was a difficulty that must be got over. The first necessity was to obtain an organisation of the Permanent Under-Secretary type; the Permanent Under-Secretary would carry on departmental work leaving members more free to deal with the legislature. This could be done without any legislation. At present for two months in the year he himself was entirely occupied in the legislature, and there was no-one to deal finally with Departmental work unless he himself worked at night after a long day in the Assembly. In reply to the Prime Minister, he said that it was only very occasionally that he even had a Sunday free. The difficulty about obtaining Parliamentary Under-Secretaries was to find Indians who would be in a position to satisfy their constituencies and yet could defend the Government. It was useless to have anyone who would not defend the Governement, but most of these men had been elected as critics of the Government. He thought, however, it might be possible to obtain the services of nominated Indians, non-officials, for this purpose, who would advocate the policy of the Governement. It would, however, be necessary to make them some promise for the future: for example, that they should become Ministers in Provincial Governments.

The Secretary of State for India, at the request of the Prime Minister, undertook to prepare a Memorandum and to formulate proposals in regard to the strenghthening of the staff of Members of Council in India, on the lines of the above discussion.

 
Recruitment of the Indian Civil Service 

THE PRIME MINISTER then reverted to the question of the recruitment of the Indian Civil Service.

SIR MALCOLM HAILEY said it had been suggested that some declaration should be made by the British Government as regards the security of the Civil Service. At present there was a tendency to feel that pensions were not secure. If a declaration could be obtained from the Governement that pensions would not be repudiated and that compensation would be given to officials who were reduced, that would have a very good effect. Some people thought there should be legislation on the subject, but he himself felt that that was unnecessary. He had never yet heard any responsible Indian suggest that pensions should be repudiated. Moreover, it was rather the people at home who feared this. If the British Government would promise to see the Indian Civil Servants through on this question, not financially, but ensuring that the Indian Government carried out its obligations, he thought many objections in the Indian Civil Service would be got rid of. In reply to the Prince of Wales, he said that the recruitment was at present bad.

LORD PEEL said it had been suggested that the British Government should give a financial guarantee. He himself had always replied, both in public and in private, that he had never heard any suggestion that pensions would be repudiated. If this happened, there would be no security for anyone in India, or, for the matter of that, in this country either. Another difficulty arose on the question of the Indianisation of the Civil Service and the proportion of Indians to be admitted, on which he had just received the report of a Committee. He had made enquiries from Head-masters of Schools at Oxford and Cambridge, and among parents, and he found there was a feeling that in eight years&apos; time


more of the higher posts would be open to Indians, and the British entrants would run the risk of being turned out at the age of 35 or 40, perhaps with a pension. This would not satisfy an ambitious young man who wanted a career. This was one of the difficulties.

Apart from these diffuculties, however, the members of the Indian Civil Service did not appear to realise how bad a time people were having at home owing to taxation and the cost of living, which appeared to have risen higher in this country than in India.

A question which to him appeared vital was that of the Medical Service. The question was arising whether doctors could be obtained to look after the wives and families of British officials and others in India. The Government of India were rather apt to urge Indianisation. The question of doctors, however, appeared to be the keynote of the whole matter. It was not so much a matter of preventing Indianisation but a difficulty of obtaining British doctors who were willing to go out and serve in India, even though the pay was now rather good.

LORD PEEL said he was advised that it was partly a temporary difficulty. There was still a shortage of doctors even in this country. The new crop of post-war doctors had not yet completed the long training that was required. The bulk of these would probably be absorbed at home. Later there would be some available for India. In the meantime the question was getting very difficult. There was a terrible shortage of doctors, and it would be fatal to fill the Service up with Indian doctors. 
SIR MALCOLM HAILEY said that the question of doctors was now one of the transferred subjects, and some of the Indian Ministers had been trying to take away the money from the Medical Services in order to devote it to ancient Native so-called systems of Medicine.

THE PRINCE OF WALES said that the shortage of doctors hit the white women worst of all.

SIR MALCOLM HAILEY agreed. The Native doctors had no experience in dealing with women. They were never allowed to see the Native women except from behind a screen or veil, and he had even known of cases of a doctor feeling a pulse at the end of a string in the next room! Consequently, even if English women could overcome the racial aversion, they had no confidence in the Indian doctors. Even in cases of child-birth the Native women were attended only by midwives, whose methods were barbarous and horrible. In reply to the Prime Minister, he said that about 40 per cent of the Indian Medical Service consisted of Indians trained in this country. There were a good many over here now under training. For some diseases, such as fevers, the Native doctors were sometimes quite good, but people did not trust their nerve in serious cases.

LORD WINTERTON said that in Palestine the men serving under him in the Camel Corps had complained at being attended by Indian doctors, in whom they had no confidence, particularly if they were going into action. 


Utilisation of Surplus Army Officers in India

THE PRIME MINISTER raised the question whether the services of surplus Indian army officers who were being retired could not be utilised for the Civil Service.

SIR MALCOLM HAILEY suggested they might be used for the police.

LORD PEEL said that the Indian Government was at present dealing with this question, examining what vacancies were available and making selections.

SIR MALCOLM HAILEY said that he thought something like 2,400 officers were being demobilised. These knew Indian conditions and would be useful.

The development of India

THE PRIME MINISTER said he understood that it was proposed to raise £100 millions to be spent on Indian development within the next 5 years. He recalled that M. Clemenceau had been very disappointed with the state of development in India. He had expected to find that far more was being done in the way of irrigation and railways.

LORD PEEL said that even this £100 millions would be spent mainly in making up defficiencies on the railways in accordance with the recommendations of the Ackworth Report. He thought that Mr Malcolm Hailey was not particularly well satisfied with the last loan, 65 per cent of which had been left in the hands of the underwriters. Mr. F.G. Goodenough, the Financial Adviser of the Indian Council, however, was not dissatisfied. The loan had been a very large one for £12 million. At first the public subscriptions had been very poor but luckily the bank rate had been lowered at that moment and eventually the people had subscribed £6 million. In reply to the Prime Minister he said the rate was 6 1/2 per cent at issue price of 6.




SIR MALCOLM HAILEY said the interest came, roughly, to 6 per cent. The position was satisfactory now and the underwriters had got rid of the whole amount. He did not think they had very much to complain of. He insisted, however, that the £100 millions would not do more than put the railways in order after the disrepair into which they had fallen in the war.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that the British Government had to consider the whole question of British industry. It looked as though the recovery of the world would be slow. Supposing the Government were willing to give some assistance to India and the Colonies, but mainly to India, would it be possible for greater development of India to be undertaken?

SIR MALCOLM HAILEY said that the condition made in the case of the 7 per cent that the whole amount should be expanded in Great Britain was unpopular in India although in fact most of the Indian expenditure did come in England.

THE PRIME MINISTER asked if the expenditure on development could be accelerated and increased if the British Government assisted.

SIR MALCOLM HAILEY said the difficulty arose in connection with the interest charges.

THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that an arrangement might be made for the interest to be charged to capital until the undertakings became remunerative.

SIR MALCOLM HAILEY said the difficulty was that the Indian Government was the sole borrower for Indian development. When they came forward to borrow, the market turned with nausea against them knowing they would be coming back to borrow again. He felt that the real remedy was to get away from the Indian Government always acting as borrowers. In the case of

 
the Sukker barrage he hoped it might be possible to obtain the money by some other method.

THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that that was our own line in the Trade Facilities Act. Would it not be possible for the Indian Government to obtain some financier to undertake development with some assistance from the Government?

SIR MALCOLM HAILEY said that this was one way of managing it. He had little hope of inducing private companies to take over existing lines on a true company system, i.e. one in which they would provide the capital for taking over the line and working it; but he thought that the lines might possibly be taken over by bodies similar to the Port Trusts.

THE PRIME MINISTER remarked that the Port of London Authority appeared to provide a precedent.

SIR MALCOLM HAILEY said that if this could be done it would be a great advantage. The Government of India were working on this problem at present. Hitherto there had been too much feeling that the Government of India could obtain cheap money. Even the £100 million programme had been very difficult to get through the Indian Parliament.

THE PRIME MINISTER said he wanted this question considered both from the British and the Indian side. At the end of 10 years there might be some economic recovery in the world, but it seemed to him to be an advantage if the British and Indian Governments could act as partners.

LORD PEEL said he was always being pressed as to the question of security. Many people would not touch Indian securities and many firms would not advise them to do so owing to the feeling of insecurity. That might involve a higher price for these loans. Then there was




was the strong feeling about the Indian Government placing contracts outside this country. At one time England had been given a 20 per cent preference but this became public with the result that pressure was put on the Indian Government to abolish it. Eventually the Government of India had decided on an open market subject to considerations of quality and so forth. Sir Malcolm Hailey was quite right, however, in saying that the bulk of the contracts from India went to this country. Moreover, the pressure on the banks in this country to take up loans for India was very great. The banks, however, had their clients and many of these objected to loans without condition of expenditure in this country. The people in the North of England were making a good deal of fuss about this. If the Indian Government were to try and place a loan in New York they would find they would get very different terms. He was not sure that the Government of India quite understood the position here or had been as sympathetic as it might be.

THE PRIME MINISTER said he had written to the Viceroy on the subject and Lord Reading had replied that India was opposed to contracts being placed exclusively with Great Britain.

LORD PEEL said that about 11/l2ths of the contracts were placed with Great Britain.

SIR MALCOLM HAILEY said that this was more remarkable because 60 per cent of India&apos;s exports went to the Continent and not to Great Britain.

THE PRIME MINISTER said this was a question which would have to be considered by a Committee he hoped the Cabinet would set up on the subject of Trade. He asked Sir Malcolm Hailey to consider whether within the next 3 or 4 years it would be possible to carry out a great scheme of co-operation whereby British capital could be utilised for Indian development, the British Government having a share.

SIR MALCOLM HAILEY




SIR MALCOLM HAILEY thought this was possible but hoped that the development would be carried out in India by private enterprise rather than by Government.

A British firm, whom he had consulted, had appeared quite keen about the Sukker barrage. If this firm supplied the capital it could be guaranteed by India.

THE PRIME MINISTER said this seemed a very good scheme.

LORD PEEL thought that irrigation schemes were likely to return the money back sooner than other schemes of the kind.

Disability Pensions for Indian Soldiers.

THE PRINCE OF WALES said that since his arrival home he had received a letter indicating that something had been done on this question.

SIR MALCOLM HAILEY  said he had hoped that the question would be settled while the Prince of Wales was in India. All the plans had been worked out and the money had been provided for in his budget. The question, however, had been hung up by correspondence on some technical point between the India Office and the War Office. The new disability pension would be equal to full pay on active services. The Indian Council were dealing with the question and he thought it would be settled next week.

?position of Indian Police.

THE PRINCE OF WALES said he thought the pay of European Police was very bad. They consisted for the most part of old soldiers. There were many men in the Indian Police who had been in India for years and years and could not afford to go home even for a holiday. They were to be met everywhere all over India.

SIR MALCOLM HAILEY said he had thought the Prince of Wales referred to the Native Police.

THE PRINCE OF WALES said that the Native Police were badly paid too, but he understood this was a matter 


in the hands of the Provincial Governments.

SIR MALCOLM HAILEY said that some of the Provincial Governments were saying them better. For example, in the Punjab the police were being paid nearly the same as soldiers. He agreed, however, that the pay of the white sergeants of police was insufficient.

LORD ? recalled that there were deficits in all the provincial budgets.

THE PRINCE OF WALES said that this was true, and it was the Indians who kept the money for these budgets so tight.

SIR MALCOLM HAILEY said that the pay of the police had been improved, but not much had been given to the European section.

THE PRINCE OF WALES said that it seemed important to pay well the men upon whom the Government constantly had to depend. What they felt so strongly was their inability to take their families home for a holiday.

LORD PEEL said that his attention had been drawn to the question of passages home, owing to the great increase of fares. The PRINCE OF WALES said it would be a great thing if some assistance could be given in the matter of passages.

SIR MALCOLM HAILEY said that in the Army the problem had been solved by giving free passages to officers on medical certificate.

LORD PEEL said that he was informed that both in the French and Dutch Colonies in the Far West, officials received their passages home.

SIR MALCOLM HAILEY said the same was true of East Africa and Nigeria.

LORD PEEL pointed out that in all these cases the pay was much lower than those of Indian officials. Even in Ceylon the pay was much lower.

SIR MALCOLM HAILEY said what really hit the Civil Servants was the cost of educating their children in England, house rent,
end passages home.

THE PRIME MINISTER asked if there were no schools in India, or if they could not be provided.

THE PRINCE OF WALES said it was very bad for British boys to get their education in India.

SIR EDWARD CRIGG said that the atmosphere was quite different.

THE PRINCE OF WALES added that some scheme for helping passages would make a considerable difference.

LORD ? said this was largely a question of money. Perhaps Sir Malcolm Hailey would tell those present something of the financial position in India.

SIR MALCOLM HAILEY said that the Indian Government had put on as much taxation as they could, and were now nearing the end of possibilities in this respect. One cause of financial difficulty was that the proportion of gross expenditure to gross receipts had increased on the railways from ? to ?% within the last two years. The rates had lately been increased 25%. It was necessary, however, to contemplate financial difficulties for some time to come. The Indian Government had had to accept a deficit of 9 crores of rupees this year. The only possibility for economy was in the Army.

THE PRIME MINISTER remarked that this was dangerous under existing conditions.

SIR MALCOLM HAILEY said that under the reform scheme, the? Provincial Governments had to contribute 9 crores of rupees, but it had always been understood that this contribution would not continue indefinitely. The Central Government consequently had to contemplate raising an additional 18 crores of rupees but the only means remaining for raising money was the salt tax. Lord Reading, however, had decided that in present conditions he could not assent to this. If Lord Inchcape&apos;s 
Committee were to recommend some reduction in expenditure, and then give the Indian Budget a certificate, it might be possible to impose the salt tax which would give 4 crores of rupees. No increase could be made in income tax. At the present time the Government had had to issue no less than 45 crores of Treasury Bills, which was very excessive. For these they had to pay high rates, 5% or even 6%. If trade revived in India it would not be possible to issue Bills to this amount. Consequently the financial position was not a happy one. What he might call the "Capital position" however was sound. He recalled that he had told the Prime Minister that the Indian Government rather felt in the position of a family solicitor administering an estate. Up to the beginning of the War they had actually had no unproductive national debt at all. The earnings from the enterprises constructed from the borrowed money more than paid the interest on the debt.

THE PRIME MINISTER thought they had not had a large enough productive national debt.             The British Position? in India. 

THE PRIME MINISTER asked whether there was any method of dispelling among Indian officials the idea which had got about that we were fighting a rearguard action in India.

SIR MALCOLM HAILEY said the Prime Minister&apos;s declaratton had had a considerable effect on the services. He thought, however, it would be very good if he were to make a further declaration to the effect that there would be no further constitutional changes until the recent reform had taken effect, had proved a sucess,
and that further changes were desirable. He might add to this a declaration in favour of giving support to the Indian Services on the lines he had already indicated.

LORD ? said that this question had heen before Mr. Montagu, and when he took over the post of Secretary of State he had found about half-dozen drafts on the subject. He at first felt some doubt as to whether he should pursue the matter, but on consulting the Viceroy he found that Lord Reading thought it desirable he should make some declaration. However, if the Prime Minister intended to make some declaration, he would hold his up.

LORD WINTERTON, in reply to tho Prime Minister, said he could easily arrange an appropriate occasion for the Prime Minister to make a statement in Parliament.

THE PRIME MINISTER summed up the conclusions of the meeting as follows:-

(a) That the Secretary of State for India should prepare a Memorandum containing proposals for strengthening the Viceroy&apos;s Council;

(b) That the Secretary of State for India should prepare a Memorandum containing proposals for strengthening the staff of the members of the Council at the head of Indian Departments;

(c) That the Secretary of State for India should prepare a Memorandum as to the steps to be taken in order to improve the recruitment of British subjects for the Indian Civil service;

(d) That Sir Malcolm Hailey should prepare a Memorandum reviewing the present position as regards the development of India, and containing proposals for further development by means of co-operation between the British and Indian Governments, in order to secure the employment of capital for the further development of India on a considerable scale;
