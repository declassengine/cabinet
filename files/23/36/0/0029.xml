[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government, and should bereturned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.].   POLITICAL.        jj.Note of Conversation between Sir Eyre Croweand the French Ambassador,&apos; October 6th,regarding the Mudania Conference.The French Ambassador called upon me today.   Heimmediately began to talk about the Eastern crisis.He opened by reading to me a telegram from M. Poincare,reporting that an unfortunate delay was being caused in the negotiations at Mudania by General Harington,who, while personally showing the greatest concilia-tion in the discussion, declared that he was bound notto go beyond his very precise instructions, and there-fore considered it necessary to refer a number of questions to his government, while his French andItalian colleagues were quite ready to settle there and then.     These were such questions as the Turkishdemand to be allowed to occupy not only Adrianople,but also Karagatch on the opposite side of the maritza.     These and other matters of the same kindsurely might be left to the judgment of the allied generals?   And M, Poincare earnestly begged that instructions might immediately be sent to general harington, giving him the &quot;fullest discretion to agreeformally to any proposals and points on which he found he could arrive at an understanding with hiscolleagues.     Owing to the rapidly and constantlyshifting situation in the East, it was impossible that negotiators should be hampered by instructions given -
1(2),given at a distance a considerable time before-hando     I replied that I found it difficult toexpress in adequate words my surprise at his proposal, coming as it did at a moment whenthe attitude of the French negotiators at mudania was threatening to wreck all possibilityof an understanding.    I asked the Ambassadorwhether he was unaware that the French Generaland M. Franklin Bouillon, who, for some reason or other, had thought fit to intrude himselfinto the military conference, in which he reallyhad no business, were taking a line absolutelycontrary to the terms of the allied note ofSeptember .83rd, and thereby destroying the har-mony which the three allied governments had with so much care established when they formal -ly sent the note.     Was I to understand that,in requesting us to give full latitude to general harington, M0 Poincare wished us to commit ourselves to approval or endorsement of theattitude which the French negotiators were adopting towards the Paris agreement?     If so,I could tell the Comte de Saint Aulaire at once that His Majesty&apos;s Government could not possiblyagree to such a thing.The Ambassador sold he failedto understand how anything that had arisen at mudania could have caused such an impression,He
He had no idea that anything was being done that wentbeyond, or was contrary to, the Paris agreement, and he expressed, not so much surprise, as incredulity when read .to him various passages from the telegrams wehad received from Sir H. Rumbold and from general harington, reporting the extraordinary demands of theTurks, to which the French had declared themselvesready to agree.    He refused to believe that the FrenchGovernment could have authorised the acceptance of theproposal that the Kemallsts should enter into immediatepossession of Thrace before the peace treaty, and with-out adequate guarantees for the safety,of the minor!-ties under the surveillance of the allied commissions,and that these commissions and all allied contingentsshould be withdraw!.     I said there could be no doubtfrom sir K. Rumbold&apos;s telegram, not only that these demands had been made, but that both the french general and M. Franklin Bouillon, knowing the objec-tions strongly expressed by General Harington, had Inthe latter presence declared to the Turkishnegotiators that they were ready to accept their pro-posals.I asked the Ambassador how, in his opinion, itwas possible to carry on allied negotiations on thebasis of previous allied agreement by methods such as these.    I explained that His Majesty&apos;s Government tookso grave a view of the situation thus created thatthey
they had charged Lord Curzon to proceed at once, to paris, in order to obtain from Monsieur Poincare&apos; adefinite statement whether or not he stood by the agree-ment of September25rd, or whether he wished to repudiateit.    The Comte de Saint Aulaire continued to exclaimthat he v/as convinced that ell this must he a misunder-standing.    There could he no question of monsieur poincare receding in any way from the Paris agreement,I repeated that, while I was only too anxious to believe in Monsieur Poincare&apos;s good faith, the Comte de SaintAulaire must not be surprised if I found it difficult to reconcile this with the French proceedings at Mudaniaand Constantinople.    I added that I could not butrecall that this was not the first time that a solemnlyregistered agreement between the allies, respecting thecourse of a common policy to be pursued&apos; in Turkey, wasthrown to the winds by the French Government, when theink was hardly dry on their signature.     In everysuccessive case of such agreements it sufficed for theTurks to raise objections, to induce Prance, withouthesitation, warmly to espouse the Turkish objectionsand to abandon the ground on which she had undertaken tomake a stand.     I was very much afraid that we had now only a repetition of these distressing occurrences;   butI warned the Ambassador that, if on this occasion wewere to be told that Prance was not prepared, on October6th, to stand by the agreement which she signed aslately as September 23rd, in a form drafted by M.Poin-care&quot; himself, the effect which such an attitude musthave on the alliance of our two countries must be serious indeed.(initialled)    E.A.C&quot;Foreign Office,October 6th. 1922.
