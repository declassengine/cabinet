NOTE OF A CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE I-PRBIE MINISTEH67,AND M, DIAKAHDY ON SUTS)AY, OCTOBER 1st,1922.PRSSENT:The Prime Minister.Monsieur Diamandy.Sir Edward Grigg.Monsieur Diamandy began by saying that he was very glad to have an opportunity&apos; of meeting the Prime minister as he had been specially deputed to come to England forthat purpose by Monsieur Bratiano*     He would like tostate the views of Roumania briefly..In her opinions the menace caused by the present-Kemalist advance was very dangerous.     The entry of theKemalist army Into Europe might have reactions which woulddisturb the whole of the territorial status quo in eastern europe.     It would inevitably involve both Russia and bulgaria, and Roumania feared a very grave situation.     Herview, therefore, was that Kemal should be kept out of Europe.In this matter she agreed entirely with Great Britain, and ,deplored the French point of view.     In particular, she de-plored the French idea that the relations of Europe with turkey could be settled by Colonial considerations.-       Roumania was threatened on, three frontiers by restlessV - - -Powers, Russia, Hungary and Bulgaria.     He remembered thatat Genoa M. Chicherin had expressly stated that, in theevent of war with Turkey, Russia would not be bound by.the pact of Non-aggression.Roumania had been surprised - if he might speak franklydisagreeably surprised - by the fact that she had not been consulted regarding the terms of the Paris Allied Note toMustapha Kemal.     She was so deeply interested in the question
and had,  es she believed, stood so faithfully by the Allie3in the ^ar that she thought she had a reason to be invitedto give her opinions before the decision was taken^ and. tohe trusted fully by the great Allies.Roumania held two views strbngly regarding the eastern question.(1)   That there should be nO eommoh frontier between turkey and Bulgaria, and that if suOh a frontier were per-mitted there should at least be a neutral zone guaranteed by the Allies.(2) That the freedom of the Straits should he safe-guarded by the demilitarisation of both the European andAsiatic shores under the control of an Allied Commission.In this respeOt Roumania was not quite satisfied with theguarantee of the League of Nations as she feared that hervery vital interests might be over-ruled by states with very limited interests such as Salvador and Guatemala.He ended by handing the Prime Minister a note which contained the views of the Roumanian Government.      (Appendix).(He also remarked that the non-settlement of EasternGalicia was causing considerable embarrassment to Roumania.Unrest among the Ruthenians reacted on Roumania, and they hoped that a settlement might soon be possible).The Prime Minister said he was glad that the roumanian government had decided to send Monsieur D-iamandy over totake the British Government into its confidencet and he ?fouldtalk quite freely.     Lord Curzon had approached the represen-tatives of both Roumania and Serbia before he went to Paris,and did his best to sec that their views were taken thoroughlyInto account.     There was, however, a good deal of hesitancyshown.     T7e made no complaint of that, hut the crisis at
that moment required prompt decisions and an arrangement had. tobe made at once.   There, had^ however, he en no idea of leavingKounania&apos; out of the conference which would settle the peace ..at presentMe did not know/what  emal Pasha v/ould do.     lie was veryelated * although, in point of fact, he had won not a military&quot;but only apolitical victory4     He was, however, undoubtedly in anuntractable frame of mind, and therefore very dangerous-     our military authorities informed us that he was massing 13 divisionsbehind the Ismid Peninsula ready to cross into Europe, and there wano telling what the Turkish leaders would do in these circumstances we had heard that a meeting was probable next Tuesday at Sudani abetween the Allied Generals and the two combatants-     Kemal mightdemand the right to occupy Eastern Thrace immediately.   That wecould not allow.     He might also demand that we should evacuateChanak.   To that also we would not consent.    Ckanak was anessential feature in the rights which we demanded.    It was anemblem of the freedom of the Straits, and we would refuseabsolutely to evacuate it.     On the other hand, if Vernal   rdveureasonable the next stage would be a full Peace Conference.We were pledgee in the event of tne conference takingplace.to invite the  reeks to retire west of the Laritsa, andto cede gastern Thrace to Turkey.     He could not see that insuch circumstances Greece would refuse.     Bulgaria would then become the heir to the troubles of Thrace, and he had nodoubt that the troubles of Thrace tinder Turkish mis-governmentwould be very terrible.     If Greece was out of those troubles,Bulgaria would inevitably be in.     She would take steps in her own/
own time, and become the most formidable Power in the balkans.     He  quite understood, therefore, that the Roumanianposition between Bulgaria, the Magyars and the Russianswas a serious one, and he also recognised that Roumenia&apos;s most formidable Immediate danger was Soviet RussianHe thought, however, that Soviet Russia was stillanxious for friendly relations with Great Britain,     GreatBritain was the only Power except the United States able tohelp Russia to her feet.     The Urquhart Agreement was apractical step in that direction,     TThen one capitalist,started others followed, and he did not think that theSoviet Government would wish to interrupt this process.For that reason he thought that we might be ^il3e to exercise a restraining influence upon Russia, and to persuade her toremain neutral.     He did not wish to exaggerate our influence which was uncertain, but he thought that we might sucoeed in preventing Russia from making any attack on our RoumanianAlly.?rithr egard to equipment, he said that he would ask theSecretary of State for War to go into the matter.     He could make no promises, but he was ready to say that if etherconditions were s atisfactory we would do our best to help.Certainly if Roumania found herself fighting on our side,she could count on our supplying her necessities.With regard to the despatch of a Roumanian contingentthere were two eventualities to be considered.If peace were preserved, Roumania would certainly beasked to provide one of the contingents necessary for theinternational guarantee of the freedom of the Straits.If war unfortunately broke out we should like to know
exactly where Roumania would stand.    The British Empirewould, as it seemed, almost inevitably be involved.    Itsforces would come rather slowly Into play.   Some of them would he sent from Australia and   Hew Zealand.    Thepresence, therefore, of Immediate contingents on the spotin the first stage of operations v, ould he very valuable.We wished, therefore, to know whether Roumania in such circumstances would assist in preventing Semal fromestablishing himself in Europe.With regard to the sea we should probably needConstanza, and arrangements would have to be made with roumania for that purpose.In any case we were prepared to see that Eouaaaniashould be guaranteed participation in the Peace Conference,and that she should be invited to participate in theinternetiozsal guarantee of the Straits.   The discussion was at present in the air, and he would not ask for an immediatereply as to RoumaniaTs intentions.   We should prbbably haveno news of how things were going to develop feefore Thursday,and he would like to see Monsieur Diamandy again later inthe week.Monsieur Diamandy said that Roumania was perfectly  .convinced that. French policy in-the Hear East was mistaken,hut, nevertheless, she BomLd always regret a division betweenGreat Britain and France.The Prime Minister said- that we desired also to act inclose co-operation with France, but that we could not sacrificethe primary interests of the British Empire for France Ts sake.He was quite sure that even if France found herself unable to. act with us she would remain the spectator of events.   There-could he no question, of course, of her intervention uponthe other side..M. Diamandy said he was sure of thai.*     a     *     * *     *     *S Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I.5th October, 1928.&apos; -5-
ABPSflPIZ T0.S.^67\ (Translation)BOifti RCtfMAJTIM ISGATIOByLondon,September 29th, 192 *Mr. prime Minister,In order to bring into harmony the points of viewof the British Government and of the Roumanian Government inregard to the present situation in Europe and in regard tothe consequences Which might follow on military operations in the Hear East, my Government, as a result of -the message which Your Excellency was so good as to eause to be trans-mitted to &apos; M. Bratiano, has instructed me to proceed to an exchange of views with the British Government and to establish,d common agreement on the following special pointscRoumania regards the complications which have arisen in the Li ear East as capable of threatening European peace and the territorial status quo as established by the treaties, not only in.the Balkans but also in Central Europe^ -In the opinion of the Roumanian Government the affairs of the Sear East should he considered not from alocal point of view, but in the wider light of the generaldevelopments to which they may give rise.The relationship, in the nature of an alliance,between Angora and Moscow, not to mention the less openrelationship with oofia, which the official representativesof the Soviets specially and openly insisted on even at genoa, leave no doubt as to the close solidarity whichbinds the  emalists to the Bolshevists.If the point of view of the Roumanian Government.is Gorreot, Roumania may he called to defend herself againstattacks on all her frontiers; but circumstanoea make it herduty to devote her principal attention to her eastern frontierwhich at any moment may; he,..faeed....with a; sudden threat fromRussia
Russia, a threat which would not fail to entail for the wholeof europe the most disastrous consequences . ...The Roumanian Government would he glad to learn thathis Britannic I-ajesty&apos;a Government, influenced by the same   .considerations, recognised the principle of the unity of all the fronts which may be attache-.; in Europe.In order to guard against these eventualities, thepoumanian Government begs His Britannic x.aiestyTs Governmentto be so good as to supply the complement of arms, equipment and military stores required by the Roumanian army,- of whicha list can be supplied to the war Office.     This Would enable thenecessary precautions to be taken.     The Roumanian Governmentventtires to request that steps should be taken to send this material with the least   Possible delay in order to avoid the grave consequences - hieh in this respect we all had to deploreduring the last war.In the event of a Russian attack taking ill ace onthe Dniester frontier, the Roumanian Government would be particularly grateful if it might -De assured of the presenceof the British flag by the side of the-Roumanian army, if only by the despatch of a single British detachment to that front.- As regards the Roumanian detachment to be sent to constantinople, the Roumanian Government, not possessing itselfsufficient means of transport, begs His Britannic Majesty&apos;sGovernment to be so good as to undertake the transport of thiscontingent both going and coming.     It also hopes that in so-far as the provisioning of- the detach rent is concerned, interritory regarding which it Is completely ignorant, it may beable to obtain from the British military authorities all necessary facilities. ;&apos; .&apos;. &apos;.Roumania expresses the desire to. participate withrights equal to,th-se of the interested powers, in the conversations/
conversations, conferences and., decisions on those questionswhich affect her vital interests in the affairs of the HearEast, of Central Europe and of Russia.With special reference to the question Of the Straits,the Eoamanian Government considers that the ablution whichwould conform most closely to the general-interests of allthe powers would be One which should maintain the liberty of the otraits by the institution of a promised commissionsimilair tb the formed European Danube Commission, and vhiehi -should extend its right of control on both shores of theStraits, both shores being demilitarised.The participation of Roumania in this commission would be established on the lines indicated above.The Hoimianian Government is opposed to the establish-msnt of common frontiers between Turkey and Bulgaria,Nevertheless if this should lead to divergences of view between our great Allies, a solution might be consideredby which a neutral zone in military occupation should be created between the two States.&apos; The Roumanian Government reserves its right to conclude, should this prove desirable, similar arrangements with the Italian and French Governmentca.The Roumanian Government would be glad to receive from the British Government a reply by which it might be assured that there la c, complete agreement of view on allthese points.Please accept, ete*(Signed)    COBST.
