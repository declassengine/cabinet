P R j 3: E JST T: *-The Prims Minister;, Gonaral Claybon,Lord curzon, Mr, Amos.Lord Ai:-.cr?.l:.y,Sir Maurice HarJcey,Sir Edward Grieg.EGYPT.. LORD ALLEHEY handed in the following re-draft to he substituted for paragraph 3.3 of the draft letter&apos; contained in his telegram Ho.  19 of the 12th January, 1$22(CP. 3614-, Ko.4, ) :-The following questions-, however (toutofois),which axo vital to the  interests of the BritishEmpire, are absolutely reserved until such time as it may bo possible, . after free discussion on both sides in the most friendly spirit, to conclude an agreement in regard thereto &quot;bet-seen--FIMAL COPY SQv,        *SECRET-.
His Majesty&apos;s .Government and the government f Y ou r II i ghn e s s ; -(a) The security cf the communica-tions of the British.Empire;(b) The defence of Egypt against all foreign aggression orinterference, direct or indirect;(c) The protection of foreign interests in Egypt and theprotection cf minorities;(d) The Sudan.Pending the conclusion of an agreement thepresent situation in regard to thesequestions will remain intact,TEE . PRIME&apos; MINISTER asked . whether theposition of the Financial A lvisoi    would stand inthis draft.LORD ALLE2JBY replied that this was theindention.LORD CURZOISF asked whether,  if the EgyptianParliament wore set up and an unfriendly Governmentcame into office, they would, be ablo to standby everything?     Could they refuse to acknowledgeSarwat Pasha; s engagements for example?    &apos;-&apos;J&apos;MR. A2iOS said he thought he would havew0 could not&apos; guarantor thatto reply in the affirmative,ivo&apos;;eho ul-i-hs-vV-no opposition ; and no poiniuox iiffi-oultios in the luuuro,.&apos;   dui  oux problem fit the presenttime was to teko up the position which,  in respect ofits-&quot;essential importance ,, and its defqnsibility, yxath2 most prudent.
THE PRIME EIHIMR said lie thought thisparagraph provided the &quot;basis of an u ndor s tand5&quot;ng.It was now a question of framing procedure.     Thiswas no longer a question merely of whether SarwatPasha would agree.     &quot;Whet they now required was a&quot;basic of policy.     Ee ashed if it would net nowbe possible to get .formulated a clear declaration to ho made by the High Coramissloner of the termsor. which we intended that Egypt should be ruled.He had asked Sir Edward&quot;Grigg;to frame something onthese 3. ines , ...LORD CXJRZOH asked if the prime Ministc;--contemplated a statement being made to the Su&apos;:.i-ar,.THE PRIME MINISTER replied in the affirmative.  .  Whoever took office, whether it. was Sarwat Pasha or someone, el.se, would do so onthe understanding that he was acting on this declaration.     This would be the basis of eurposition in Egypt and and should not be dependenton the attitude cf any particular individual.   he himself thought that it would not be possible toget an agreement at once.      &quot;So Egyptian minister could sign any agreement.      If he did so he wouldbe thrown over by his own people.      If, however,we ware to wait, the present feeling in Egypt mightdisappear and be forgotten.    It was importanthowever to have an instrument setting forthexactly the terms :n which we would deal with egypt.     He Sad felt that very strongly the same morning in his conversation with Lord Al?enby
He beLieved that he and .Lord ALLenby had the sameultimate ends in;view.     He felt that seme declaration was necessary.&apos;    It should not he long and should merely constitute :a short compendious declaration ofour position in Egypt including a statement of the concessions we were prepared. tb -make. . .SIR EDWARD GRIGG shewed a rough hut ina^mpletedraft which the Prime Minister read. -LORD ALLEKBY did not think that any EgyptianMinister would accept, this/     . The revised draft ofpara. 13 was a&amp; far as he was -willing to go to modify -1 the attitude expressed in his letter,.     His position was perfectly well known in Egypt.     Five weeks agohe could have guaranteed a sound, stahlo and friendlyMinistry on the &quot;basis of that letter. ,   He hoped thathe might still be able to secure this, but he was less sure.      He appealed, however, to the PrimeMinister to let him try.     Any new phraseology;,, however,would-arouse the utmost suspicion.      It was difficultto believe hew much effort had been expended in ever-coming the suspicions of the Egyptians, and&apos; inducingthem to accept the wording he proposed.      He felt thatthe new draft of para. X3 gave;the fullest guaranteesthat we required.   &apos;. - He only proposed to send -theletter after the Government had been, formed.THE PRIME MINISTER thought that, it would benecessary to govern on some such lines as were indicatedin the rough draft proclamation (Sir Edward Grigg&apos;draft) which he had just read.LORD ALLENBY said that in this event he wouldhave to insist on the acceptance of his resignationwhich he had offered, some weeks age.
THE PRIME MINISTER asked Lord Allenby, who said he had been patient for five weeks, to be patient for five minutes more. He was doing to meethis utmost to meet Lord Allenby&apos;s views. If the Egyptians refused to form a Ministry on the basis of Lord Allenby&apos;s policy then they must be governed somehow. That was a reason for drawing up a definite basis of policy. Lord Allenby would ask them to form a Ministry on this basis. If they refused then some document must be issued showing the basis on which Great britain had offered that Egypt should be governed.

MR. AMOS said that in that event an entirely new document would be required. The basis now under consideration  which contemplated the handing over of foreign affairs to Egypt and containing a declaration of policy etc., presupposed the co-operation of the Egyptians.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that in this event it would of course be necessary to govern Egypt as a conquered country. It would be important, however, to issue a document showing exactly what the position of the British Government was.

LORD ALLENBY said that if he could go back with his draft letter of January 12th modified as regards para. 13 as set forth above, he thought he might succeed in getting together an Egyptian Ministry, but he could not do so on any other terms.

THE PRIME MINISTER said he fully realised Lord Al1enby&apos;s difficult personal position.
LORD CTTRXON suggested that an additionalparagraph, might &quot;be added at the end of Lord AlXoxibyT sletter to the effect that &quot;Upon the ab;*ve ternsHis Majesty&apos;s Government are -willing to co-operate with the Egyptian Government in the government&apos;ofthe country&quot;.      Failing this the British Governmentwould have to govern in its own way.THE PRIME MINISTER said he would like to,thinkfurther about&apos; the matter) and in any event it wasnecessary to consult the Cabinet :,..y &apos; In the meanwhilehe would like to see whether a simpler draft,than..Lord Allenby&apos;s letter could not he prepared.      Sucha draft should include the gist, of.; paragraphs10, 11, 12 and the ,new. 13 in Lord allenby drafidespatch contained in. his telegram of the 12thJanuary.    ;. If a document of. that; kind could be framed the Cabinet .might meet the following day at p.m, to consider it.LORD ALLE2JBY asked why the Prime minister would not accept his draft letter as it stood,THE PRIME MINISTER said &quot;he-was quite alive to Lord Allenby&apos;s difficulties but he wanted LordAllehby to realise that Great Britain was-&apos; a parliamentary country.     There would be a. very, fierceresistance to &quot;the poMcy Lord Allenby proposed..Certain sections would say that&apos;&apos; we were giving upEgypt, evacuating it,., shewing the white feather etc.Quotations from the early part of Lord Allenby&apos;sletter would be made and would be criticised ashighly objectionable.    -After all they were not essential and were to a certain extent &quot;flummery&quot;.
LORD ALLENBY said that this portion of the letter was important in the East.

THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that in this event the early portion of the letter should be put into a separate, document, but Parliament would not like the letter as it stood.  He felt that with the early part of the letter attached he would not he able to carry the essential portions through Parliament.  He suggested that there should be a separate letter from Lord Allenby to the Sultan containing the gist of the early portion of Lord Allenby&apos;s draft and that the essential, part of it, namely paras. 10 to l3, should be included in a separate document.

LORD ALLENBY suggested that his paras. 10 to 13 as revised should be adopted as they stood. If his advice was not accepted he felt the Government had better find someone else, whose advice they could accept.

THE PRIME MINISTER said he had suggested the adoption of, Lord Allenby&apos;s 10 to 13 including the new para. 13, to he taken as the basis He suggested that that should be framed in the form of an instrument and that the remainder bf the letter should be embodied as a separate covering letter to the Sultan. Thus the letter would end at paragraph 9 of the original draft, and paras. 10 to 13 would be embodied in a separate document.

LORD CURZON said that, as Lord Allenby had pointed out, paragraphs 1 to 9 were merely preambles.

LORD ALLENBY said he attached importance to this in dealing, with orientals.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that his proposal was that these paragraphs should be addressed to
orientals but not to the British Parliament Paragraphs 10 to 13 would be what he and Lord Curzon would have to get accepted in the British Parliament.

MR. AMOS said he understood that the early part of the letter was not to be included in the instrument. There were, however, political advantages in the letter appearing in the same Gazette as the announcement of the opening of the new Egyptian Government. As he understood the matter, under the procedure now proposed, the essential parts of the letter were to be communicated to Parliament, in which case they would be published before Lord Allenby returned.

THE PRIME MINISTER said this was a mere question of tactics which could be discussed afterwards.

MR. AMOS insisted that the procedure as well as the language was being changed. The moment the question was discussed in Parliament the High Commissioner would be bound to publish the document that was under discussion there.

THE PRIME MINISTER said he only contemplated discussing a document based on paragraphs 10 to 13 in the British Parliament, the remainder was for Egyptian consumption.

LORD ALLENBY asked if he might go back to Egypt and tell the Sultan that this was being recommended.

THE PRIME MINISTER said he would like paragraphs 10 to 13 put into shape in the form of an instrument




or proclamation. He would like to have it indraft and put it &quot;before the Cabinet at 6 p.m. on thefollowing evening.LORD CURZ01T questioned whether in paragraph 10it was advisable to include the words &quot;without waiting for the conclusion at the Treaty&quot;.     He wasnot sure if there was to be a Treaty.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed.LORD ALLEKBY said that if the document was tohave a bad affect as ibe materially altered it wouldwould arouse suspicion in  the mind of thoseEgyptians with whom wo were dealing.    y f -The Meeting ,adj adjourned with the -understandingthat Lord Allenby and his advisors should meet a representative of the Foreign Officeand Sir Edward Grigg on the following morning&apos;with - a view to drafting an instrument or proclamation to be based on&apos; paragraphs 10 to 13 (para. 13 as revised)of the draft letter included with LordAllenby1s Telegram No. 19 of the   .12th January.      This draft to be availablefor the Cabinet at 6 p.m. on the followingevening,.2 Whitehall Gardens, .S.W.1.15th February, 1922.
