Sir Maurice Hankey.

THE GENOA CONFERENCE.

THE PRIME MINISTER welcomed Dr. Benes who he said was in a better position than he himself to judge of affairs in Central Europe and consequently would, he hoped, be able to give him very valuable information affecting the Genoa Conference.

DR. BENES said that Genoa had produced a great impression on the whole situation in Central Europe, particularly as regards Germany and Russia. At first, he would say quite frankly, his Government had felt a little afraid of the Genoa Conference. For two years their policy had been one of concentration and reconstruction. They had succeeded to a very considerable extent from a political and economic point of view, and more particularly in regard to administration. Moreover, Czecho-Slovakia had co-operated with Austria and had worked with Poland. All the difficulties with Poland had now been removed. Czecho-Slovakia had done a good deal to help Austria and thought in the end this policy would succeed. His country had tried also to co-operate to a certain extent with Russia, as well as with Germany. The reason. however, that Genoa had evoked some apprehension was that up to the present time Germany had been blockaded politically
and oOmmer-c^waXljr-and-vnow-she. was.&quot; for the first timeasked to come into the international policy of Europe,This was a very great change for all Central Europe-and the extent ox it was probably hardly realised here-He himself was not opposed to the admission &quot;of Germanyinto European, policy.      He had always told the French that he was in favour of working with Germany,      How,however, Germany came-right into the internationalpolicy of Europe *     before this, Czecho-SAc^/ak:?:,a tadpossessed certain advantages, but a new era was openednow that Germany was admitted to a more importantposition in Europe,      The weight of - 60 millions of people could not fail to make itself felt academicallyand materially all through Central Europe,,      -tie was&apos;notopposed to this move, but he must ask Great Britain andFrance to take this consideration very seriously Intoaccounto     He agreed with the policy now being adopted;in fact, he thought it absolutely necessary and stood foit, but this must not be allowed to.interrupt the probesof consolidation ?n Central Europe *     His first cjuestionwas, &quot;Are we prepared, for the new policy as regards -.Germany?&quot;     His reply was. &quot;Yes3.     On the whole..inall the circumstances it was net a bad influence- forCzecho-Slovakia, but it was essential that Great Britainand France should be in agreement on all questions affecting European policy.      That was his - first pointiFor two years he had been trying to do-BalkaniseCentral Europe,      Czecho-Slovakia had now got on goodterms with Austria; Yugo-Slavia and ^oumaiiia., and evonwith Hungary to some-extent, and he hoped in time toarrange all difficulties with Hungary.-,     He was con-vinced now that no trouble need be expected in Central
Europe provided, that the .great authority of tne Allieswas maintained and Central Europe was to proceed inaccordance witn the principles of European policy adopted in Paris and London.     As regards Genoa,- it wasvery disagreeable to him to be asked whether ha was sbandingin with Prance or with England.      He had said the samsthing in France and had expressed the same ideas that hewas now expressing in regard to German and Russian policy.      HiHis view was very strongly that peace in Qeniral Europe was dependent on what was done in.Earis and London,As regards Russiahis Government&apos;s policy for two or three years now had been one of non-interventioncHe had discussed the question in Paris, where they werenot very satisfied with his Government&apos;s attitude.They had had their prisoners in Siberia.;    they themselveswere Slavs and understood tne Slav characteristics;they were in a peculiarly good position for observationnot only of Russia, but of Germany and &quot;of West and East;indeed, his country was in a position to make a synthesisof the policy between East and West,      Hence,  theyoriented their policy to fit in with what was happeningwith Germany and Russia, as well ts western countries.As regards Russia, h,j ne had said, nis policy was one ofnon-intervention, but it was also a policy favouring themethod r-f commercial and economic relations.      fle himself had never liKed the French intervention policy whichhe had always felt was bound sooner or later to end indisaster.      He equally disliked tneir policy of entirenon-intervention,      what he favoured was economic and commercial relations-      The difficulty he and Dr.Iviasaryk found, however,  was to have these relations
without- comp-tfomiajjag&quot;&apos; their&apos; &apos;Bu;ro-pe*Ji- policy they, found it difficultto combine a European policy with one of pushing Russia towards civi-lised methods &quot;and gradually eradicating the methods of the Soviet-He and Dr,.M.asaxyk had &quot;been eonyinced for &quot;some time that no other government was possible in Russia.      ^e had no confidence in Russianemigres, but they thought it absolutely necessary to begin to helpRussiao-     He would now explain what they had done in this direction..Eighteen months ago they had accepted a Bolshevist Mission in Pragueand had theirs elves sent a Mission to Russia..    &quot;This had been a largoMission composed of people knowing the Russian.language and withfriends among Russians of all classes,  including Bolshevists.      Everyfortnight he received     very&apos;full reports from his Mission on all matters relating to the economic system of Russia and developments in industry, etc.      Be thought it was- necessary to do this because in order to Europeanise Russia, Europeans must be in Russia itself,He hs-d no fear of the Bolshevists in his own country;     There wasa great Socialist movement in Czecho-Sloyakia, but he had no, fearof Bolshevism.      The essential point was to have a Mission in Russia-.The Russians &quot;became very irritated if they thought that their, actionswere being- too closely scrutinised.     They wished to have a good&apos;-topress in the West and not/be regarded any longer as outcasts-      Tneyhad now begun the work of reconstruction, but, of course,  it xiadadvanced a very short distance compared with pre-war.      The fact- waothat Russia could do nothing without the West-     He thought it essential to act. on the principle of reciprocity^, but had not wishedto give diplomatic recognition.      he had only bargained for equaltreatment.      At the very time that the Genoa Conference was beingconvoked, he had reached the stage of a treaty with Russia, whichwas to provide for trade and commerce and was to include threepolitical points;- first, neutrality, secondly, reciprocity of concessions in regard to consular and diplomatice relations, and thirdly, recognition of the Bolshevist Delegation as the only repre-sentatives of Russia-.     He had wished to avoid recognising theemigresv
This .practlc;&amp;lXy amounted to do facto recognition,The moment, the Genoa Conference was announced, how-evethe Russians had withdrawn, from this Treaty as&apos; theyhad said they.might hope to get more from Genoa,Just as he had left Prague, M* Rakcvsky,     Presidentof the Ukraine,. had insisted on:seeing him, and had told him he wished to stand well with the FrenchGovernment, and authorised Dr.. Benes to tell theFrench Government that they were not opposed to theTreaty of Versailles.     They did not want the french to oppose them at Genoa.&apos;.Czecho-Slovakia had done a sufficientlysatisfactory business on the economic and commercialside with Russia.      They had adopted this policyknowing that it would eventually lead to recognition,but they had always felt, particularly in view of thesituation in France, that full recognition must onlybe given in conjunction with the Great Powers whowould secure the proper guarantees.     The conditions on which such recognition should be given were, Inhis view, as follows: -*(l)    The Bolshevists must undertake to ceasepropaganda.      They were prepared to give an engagement In regard to this-, but,of course, the question was to ensurethat the engagement would bo fulfilled,(2)    There must be a certain degree of liberty-for the Russian people0  .   His Mission in moscow found that they suffered very much from the activities of the Secret Police.THE PRIME MINISTER enquired whether Dr. Beneswas asking for greater liberty from the Bolsheviststhan he had received from the Czar.DR. BENES replied that he was.
THE PR IKE MINISTER pointed out that the Frenchbefore the war had had an alliance with the Czar,,He had never heard that this resulted in any liberty,.Was Dr. Benes no?; asking, more from the Bolsheviststhan the French had received from the Czar2DR. BENES explained that he meant liberty for hisown people and for Russian people dealing with them.The present position was that if a Russian came tothe Czecho-Slovak Mission he was liable to bepersecuted.     If;Russia were not permitted to come tothe foreign Missions there was little they could do.MR.. LLOYD GEORGE said he presumed Drt Benes hadno intention of interfering with the internal affairs in Russia.DR. BENES said this was so.     He only demandedliberty for his own people.THE PRIME MINISTER said that as long as he basedhimself on that he was on sound ground,DR. 3ENBS said that what it amounted to was thatthe - Bolshevists would have to get rid of the SecretPolice and adhere to Y/estern juridical methods,THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that the Bolsheviswould probably be unwilling, to get rid of the SecretPolice.     The Czar had relied greatly on the SecretPolice who were essential to despotism.     It wasnot clear that any form, of Government except despotismwould be able to carry on in Russia,     He did notthink it would be possible to interfere with thePolice.DR. ERNES/
DR. BENES agreed and said he would base--himselfentirely on what was required for his own people.MR. LLOYD GEORGE agreed this was the best line totake.DR. BE MIS said his third Condition was thatthere should only be one Government In Russia.,     Atthe present time they had to deal with three;   first,Lenin;    secondly, the Third Internationalj   and thirdly, theTchaika, or Secret Police *      If Leninagreed to one thing the Third International was liable to attack it, and they were constantlyattacking the Trestern Powers.      It was essentialthat if diplomatic or commercial relations were tobe established there should only be one set of people to deal with.   .TEE PRIME MINISTER remarked that these threeconditions amounted to a do Jjuro recognition,DR, BENES said there was a fourth condition -that they should undertake to apply the threeconditions they had named.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that that appliedto all the countries with whom relations wereentered into.DR, BENES said that the question, of private property was already practically settled.     In theTreaty (Bhlch the Bolshevists, had only failed to signbecsu.se they hoped to got more from Genoa they hadalready accepted the principle of private property.This would give a new basis for-life in Russia.      his knowledge - of Russia and the Russians&apos;, however, ledhim to the view that a long time must elapse before... any real/
any real result was achieved,,THE PRIME MINISTER remarked that the sooner a beginning was made the sooner results would be reached,DR; BENES said that he  also thought that for reasons&quot; of humanity it was essential to help Russia,Millions of people might be saved therebya     Consequent-ly he Was against, a policy of total non-intervention,,Any commercial relations would tend to help savethese people*THE PRIME MINISTER asked if he was in favour ofgiving reliefoDR. BENES replied that this was so, but what hewas referring. to rather was e economic relations *.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he  did not disagreewith Dr. Benes&apos; general statement*     Substantially it represented his own view and that of the BritishGovernment,,     He had thought that it also represented the view of the French Government.     At that time hehad been dealing with M. Briand, and almost the wholeof Dr. Benes &apos; conditions had been included, in the cannes document?     The only extra conditions Dr. Beneshad mentioned were the condition about the positionof strangers and. their relations  with Russia, and thecondition of dealing with one Government instead oftIiree-0     Ho did not see why there should be any difference of opinion on this&quot;question between Franceand Great Britain,      The trouble was that France wasconstantly changing her Prime Minister,DR. BENES said he had explained his point of viewto - M. Poincare .who had heard it without giving anyreasons/
reasons ^against it.&apos;    He thought, therefore, that M.Poincare would tend to take M* Briand1s view0     Hehad, however, discussed the  same question for two hours, with It. Millerand .who was altogether opposedto his views and had raised many objections,,.      M,Millerand had thought it absolutely necessary that at genoa one of the Powers&apos; should say definitely that she could never recognise&apos; Russia except on this and thisconditions     In fact, he gathered that M. Millerandwas  altogether against any sort of relations with theSoviet,     He himself had given his own reasons, but M.Millerand had not  appeared convinced.THE TRIMS MINISTER said that the decision wouldprobably rest with M. Poincare.     He would like verymuch to know if M. Poincare was in favour of relationswith Russia.     It was very important to him to knowthis.     He would say quite frankly what the british point of view was.     We were an&apos;industrial nationdependent to a great extent on markets for our industryOnly a one-seventh part of our population wasagricultural, and the bulk of the remainder wa-soindustrial.      International trade was essential to us,w*e hkd two millions unemployed which constituted ourdevastated.area,     We had had to spend  100,000,000to keep the unemployed alive *     Hence, we intendedto make peace.     &apos;3&apos;e wished to go forward with France,and it would be very foolish for France to drive us togo forward with&apos;Russia aid Germany for economic reasons.   DR. BEHES said&apos;that his country&apos;s position wa.svery similar.     .Gs echo-Slovakia was also largely an industrial country -dependent oh markets in Russia andGermany, and with an .exchange;higher than that, of its.....   - 9- ne ighb ours. /
neighbours.     Consequently he was well able tounderstand the Britisli point of view.THE PRIME MINISTER said It was absolutely essential for Great Britain to go on with the policyshe was now pursuing*     Trade was vital to her and she must be in a position to deal with Central Europe,&apos;- Consequently peace was essential,,     He hoped that france would Come with Great Britain, but M. Poincarewas raising a multitude of small points and asking forthree months&apos; delay.     Ho, himself, was determined tohave peaceaBR. BENES said he had insisted with M. Poincarethat France must change her point of vidw vis-a-visRussia.THE PRIME MINISTER reminded Dr. Benes that france had been in the Chair at the time of the  decisionto call the, Genoa -Conference,     Now she was raisingall sorts of conditions, making the position verydifficult.THE PRIMP MINISTER then had to leave to take the chair at the luncheon to Mr. Balfour.     He arranged to meet Dr. -Benes on the following daynO u - - a2, Whitehall- Gardens,16th February 1922.
