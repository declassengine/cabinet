He then read thefollowing answer he had .given to a Question in Parliament on-October 27tn., 1221*rtWith regard to the last part,    ;myHonourable friend may rest-assured that no change will he made in the relation between this country and egypt -without adequate opportunities-being -given for -discussion ;byPar! parliament.&quot;san&apos;d the following answer -given on -November .10th, 1921   -&quot;Undoubtedly Parliament will have tobe consulted in any important change inour relations with Egypt.     -Anythingdone will be -with the sanction of   1Parliament.;   but it is quite impossiblefor the Foreign ^Secretary to conduct negotiations if every suggestion putforward is to be submitted to Parliament...&apos;&quot;The Prime Minister pointed out that on the one hand it wouldbe very awkward if the policy were announced before lord allenby had ceiximunict-ted it -to the Sultan of Egypt., but on-1-
the other hand, after he had communicated it to the Sultan it would be difficult to change the policy; in fact, it would be Lord Allenby&apos;s last offer. Consequently, the final offer would have been before Parliament has been consulted.

THE LORD PRIVY SEAL recalled the criticisms that had been made in the House of Commons as to the fulfilment of Government pledges on other questions and laid stress on the importance of arranging a procedure that could not be critisised in this respect.

LORD CURZON, asked by the Prime Minister to give his idea of the procedure, said it was that some sort of general sketch of the policy should be given in Parliament the same day. Then Lord Allenby would return to Egypt taking with him his draft letter to the Sultan, with the Government&apos;s Declaration as an Annex, and would present it to the Sultan of Egypt. He hoped and anticipated that Lord Allenby would be in a position to say that he had not only presented the letter, but that Sarwat Pasha had succeeded in forming a Ministry. Simultaneously, the document would be presented to Parliament. There would then be a debate in both Houses. The Only doubt he felt was as to the situation if Lord Allenby should not succeed in forming a Ministry. Then a more difficult situation would arise, for it would be absurb to ask Parliament to agree to a  policy when no Egyptian Ministry would carry it out. He had considerable hope, however, that this situation would no arise. He felt that it was very important to be in a position to announce to Parliament that an Egyptian Ministry was being formed at the same time as the policy was being communicated. He presumed that in Parliament, the approval of the policy would be moved by resolution. He thought by the means every pledge would be fulfilled.

THE PRIME MINISTER recalled that in the draft of the letter forwarded in his telegram No. 17 of January 12th - C. P. 3614. No. 4 - Lord Allenby had included the following phrase:-




"With this object in view I am happy to be able to announce to Your Higness that His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to recommend to British Parliament, without waiting for conclusion of a Treaty, abolition of Protectorate and recognition of Egypt as an independent Sovereign State."

TThat sentence had dropped out of the new draft letter. If it were re-inserted it would merely inform the Sultan that the British Government were prepared to recommend this policy to Parliament. In this way the Government&apos;s pledges would be fulfilled.

LORD ALLENBY agreed that there was no objection to ?. 

THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that the same committee as had drafted the new letter and the Government&apos;s Declaration, namely, Sir Edward Grigg, Mr. Murray and General Clayton - should meet in order to re-insert this phrase.

The Ministers then discussed the question of when the announcement should be made in the House of Commons.

LORD ALLENBY said he expected to be able to hand the Declaration to the Sultan next Monday afternoon and it was arranged that the announcement in both Houses of Parliament should be made on Tuesday afternoon - February 28th.

THIS LORD PRIVY SEAL undertook to arrange that if necessary, a day should be given for the discussion in the House of Commons on Wednesday, March 1st.

LORD CURZON raised the question of what would happen if Sarwat Pasha, should decline to form a Ministry.

LORD ALLENBY thought that probably Sarwat Pasha would not decline, but in that event he hoped he would be able to find someone else to form a Ministry.

THE PRIME MINISTER remarked that if no Ministry was formed. Lord Allenby would govern according to the status quo.

The conclusions of the Conference may be summarised
us follows&quot;: -(&amp;) In order to oacry out the policy approved bytile Cabinet (Cabinet 10(2.2),- Conclusion E) con-siatently with pledges given to Parliament, thefollowing Committeejir Edward urigg,Mr.Murray (ox the Foreign Office)General Claytonshould meet tue same day in order to insert inthe. Iovgoi&quot; to be sent by lord nilenby to tueSultan,. words similar to those used in lord&apos;4lle&apos;nby&apos;s original draft letter of January 12th,to snow that tne policy set forth in the Leclara-tion (Cabinet 10(2.2); Appendix) was one which HisMajesty&apos;s Government was pr-pared to recommend to Parl lament- -(b).That the: Declaration should be eommuhieated    .to the Sultan by the High Commissioner immediatelyph. his. return to iigypt, that is to say, on Monday,-February 2?tn,.(c) The policy should be.announced in both houses of Parliament On Tuesday\ February 28th.(d) Tne. Lord Privy Seal should arrange for a day to. be given to.&apos; the discussion on iilgypt if desired by the House of Commons:, on Wednesday, March 1st.(e) If the. High Commissioner is unable to form an egyptian Li in is try on trie basis of this policy,xie should continue to govern the country as atpresent&apos;.PLAYING THIS E.      iO:KD ^LLiiUBY then raised some minor points on whichI KATtOlUCLAH^Hiibl IB       he wished to have guidance&apos;.jSGYPT&apos;.Lord Allenby said that oh his official appearances in public, he was ttocorded a Guard of Honour^, and the band usuallyplayed the first five bars of &quot;God &quot;Save tne King&apos;* *     he presumed txiat it Would be advisable to continue this&apos;,&apos;L0 4D OUKZOSI agreed that he should do so.OFF 10141* 3&quot;.      L04D 41L.tiUHY St.. id thai the practice was for theCaLLS 0 l ........THE SDL!E4X^   Sultan to call on him on the King&apos; u birthday; while he calledbh the Sultan dh the Accession Lay and on the Sultan&apos;s birth-day;    thus he called twice and the Sultan cal led once.LOnD CUHZOil said that anything that maintained the HighCommissioner&apos;s prestige should be continued, and that thereshould be no change in this procedure.PUBLIC- 4&quot;.     liOHD -mJiLj^IBY said that &apos;iit present tne King&apos;s birthdayHOLIDAY Oil THiSKINGfs BlivTH-was a public holiday in iSgyot.      This rather brought theMY,
Protectorate into prominence and was repugnant to many Egyptians.

LORD CURZON agreed with Lord Allenby that it might be desirable to drop this public holiday as there were ample to other public holidays, but he thought Lord Allenby should not do so on his own initiative but only if asked to so so.

LORD ALLENBY said he only wanted general guidance on this point and might have to refer for instructions later.

VISITS TO THE RACES.

5. LORD ALLENBY said that if he went to the races, the procedure was for him to go first and be received by the Guard and five bars of the National Anthem. The Sultan arrived later and was received with the Khedivial Anthem. The Sultan left first to the strains of the Khedivial Anthem and Lord Allenby left afterwards when five bars of the National Anthem were played. He presumed that this procedure should continue.

LORD CURZON agreed that it should.

DIPLOMATIC VISITS.

6. Lord Allenby said it was his custom as High Commissioher to send for the French or Italian Ministers and not to visit them. He presumed that this should continue in order to show that the British High Commissioner was the senior foreign representative.

LORD CURZON agreed that this should be the case.
