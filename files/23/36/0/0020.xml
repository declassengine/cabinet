D. Lloyd George, 0,M.,M.P.,PriTfQ Minister.Tha Right Hon. Sir Laming Worthington Evans,G.B,F.,M*P., Secretary of State for War.Sir Maurice Hankey, G.C,B.,(Secretary),m SITUATION      The Secretary of State for War handed the Prime MinisisrAT CONSTANTI-NOPLE. a letter in regard to the situation at Constantinople, sug-suggesting that tha question should be discussed at the present conference sufficiently to enable a public announcement tobe made that progress is being made.In tha course of the discussion Sir Laming worthington evans pointed out that the Greeks have already concentratedtwo Divisions from Smyrna near Constantinople, and &amp;a$s con-tinuing to bring in fresh troops.   In addition, they have moved a good many guns to this region.   They had not made this concentration for nothing, and if the present allied conference dispersed without discussing the situation inthe Near East at all it would not ba safe to assume thatno action would ba taken hy a Greek army which knew thatit would not he kept in being much longer owing to financial
stringency, and which despaired of any action by theAllied Powers.   Moreover, there was risk to Constantinoplefrom the Asiatic side.    The French and Ttalim forcesat Constantinople were being increased,    These troops,while they would resist a Greek array, could not he countedon to resist an advance by the ^urks.    The British forces,therefore, ought to he transferred to the Israid Peninsula,the garrison of which wa3 now reduced to two Companies.The Prime Minister considered that the present moment, .when we were almost faced with a break with France on the reparations question, was peculiarly inopportune for rais-ing this question.    If an agreement could he reached itmight he possible to raise the question;    otherwise hethought it v/o\xld be unwise.   He had had some diactission onthe subject with M. Schanzer, whom he had advised to cometo terms with the Greeks in regard to the Dodecanese.M. Cchanzer, though no friend of the Greeks, had intimated that he believed he could not only cove to terms with Groecin regard to the Dodecanese but could induce them to leaveSmyrna.   Apparently ha had received Ssjee information fromthe Italian Minister in Athens which led him to this con-elusion.   The Prime Minister thought that after his speech in the House of Commons on Friday last, August 4th, therewas little risk of the Greeks advancing on. Constantinople.He had made this speech as the result of most carefulconsultation with the Acting Secretary of - State for ForeignAffairs (Lord Balfour) and several officials of the ForeignOffice, and had chosen his words most ear-fully.   Indeed,he had made notes of the very phrases used by Lord Balfour,and had employed them, in his speech.   He believed that asthe result of this speech the Greeks would now turn their attention again to Smyrna,   He agreed that they were in3erious financial straits, but his speech would probablyresult in their trying again to secur- a loan.   They had
nearly succeeded in getting a loan in London before, andwould probably have obtained it but for the bad handling ofthe matter by M. Gounaris.   Now there w-&apos;.re powerful inter-ests working for ther in London.   Even Lord Long, to hissurprise, had evinced an inter-si in the Greeks.   As regardsthe risk of an advance by Mustapha Kernel on Ismid, -he pointedout that in that event General ITorington&apos; s hands would he ,strengthened by the presence of four Greek Divisions in eastern Thrace.   He could even transport Greek troops tothe Ismid Peninsula to oppose the Turks, and in any event the Greet fleet would make it difficult -&apos;or the Turks touse the coast road.   He also pointed out on a map the risks to which a Turkish force advancing on Ismid would even now,after the withdrawal of two Divisions from Smyrna to Thrace,he exposed from the Greek army deployed on its flank.On the whole, therefore,  the Prime Minister suggestedthat the question should       not ho r-eis^d at the present conference unless and until agreement was in sight on themain question pf reparations.Whitehall Gardens, S.;V.l,August 9, 1928.
