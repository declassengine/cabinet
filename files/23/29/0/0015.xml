KRIAGE      (1)        The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read toESEJS-1? TO[NGESS the Cabinet a letter which he had received from Her_Royal Highness Princess Mary thanking the Cabinet fortheir gift on the occasion of Her Highness&apos; marriage.
-2-JJTES ./ITH   (2) The Minister of Labour reported to the CabinetpUSBS AIDGUILDERS, that two serious industrial disputes ?/ere pending,it&quot;&apos;       .Cue a threatened lookout by the Engineering employers to take place on March 11th and a notice by the shipbuilding Employers to reduce wages from March 15th,The former dispute had arisen in connection with acontroversy over the delimitation of duties as between employers and Trade Unions.     Formulae satisfactory to the&quot;men&apos;s leaders had been arrived at, but these had been rejected by the men, very few cf whom, however, had gone to the poll.     In the second case, the Employers &quot;Tiadgiven notice that wages would be reduced by 16/6d a week from 15th March, and by a further 10/- at a subsequentdate to be agreed upon.     The men had asked the Ministryof labour to put the Industrial Courts Act into oper-ation.     In each case negotiations were taking place,and the Ministry if Labour undertook to circulate tothe Cabinet a memorandum dealing with the situation.
fellAN  .IaineIEF.RUSSIANrawI GREATiETAIN.(3) With reference to Cabinet  f        , Conclusion 4,the Cabinet considered the general question of making a .rantwir^-aid o^ Russian Famine Relief, and the particular question of admitting a number of Russian children intothis country und*r the care of certain philanthropicorganisations (Paper CP.-3761).The Lord Privy Seal stated that the matter was raised at the wish of the- Prime Minister, who was unableto be present owing to illness.   Questions addressed tov.the proposal^e Minister in the uouse o^ Commons had been post-poned to that afternoon in ord*r ,&apos; o--afford * the government an opportunity of reaching a decision on the sublet.   ThePrime Minister held very strongly the view that, despite the depressed conditions of this country, its traditionalhumanitarian policy should be maintained and a grant bemade fro?&apos; public funds&apos;-corresponding to sums raised fromvoluntary sources.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs supported the Prime Minister&apos;s proposal, and assured the Cabinet thatany sum voted by the Government, would go direct to themaintenance &apos;of human life.   The three British organisationsat *7orfc       the Province of Samara (the Russian Relief Fund,the Save the Children Fund, the Society of Friends) had joined forces and &apos;*ere doing splendid work within theirlimited means.   The immediate objective was to keep.alivethe peasants in that area until the harvest in August next.For  his purpose a grant of from  250,000 to  350,000 wassu^.i?.est*d to meet a similar sum to be&apos; subscribed by thepublic.   Such a sum. wtruld enable hundreds of thousands oflives to be saved.   There was no intention of competingthewith f much more ambitious schemes of the Americans, oreven with that put forward by-Pr Nansen,
The Sees tary of State for the Colonies strongly opposed the proposal, mainly on the following grounds:(a) The famine was mainly due to the incon-CAivablP wickedness of the Soviet Gov-ernment, who could greatly mitigate itsravages if they diverted for that endmoney they were now spending on maintain-ing a huge Red army, purchasing armaments and equipment,  and organising propaganda against civilised States:(b) Such a grant was absolutely unjustifiableat the present moment, when large numbersof our population at home were sufferingacute privation ort account of unemployment:(c) The proposal was one whioh would be deeplyoffensive to large numbers of the supporters of the Govemmei t, and it was most undesir-    :able to aggravate the present difficult situation by adopting it.-The Minister of Labour regretted to have to oppose )ithe grant, but felt compelled to do so In view of theUnemployment posi. tion at home, and the fact that theGovernment were rejecting local schemes of relief, goodin themselves, for lack of money.   The Chancellor of theExchequer had more than once raised the amount of the Govern-ment contribution to local schemes, but despite this increaseschemes had to be turned down, and these were schemes forwhich local authorities were prepared to shoulder a consider-able portion of the cost.   Further, on April 5th next thepresent Unemployment Insurance Scheme would come to an end and there would be several areas in which tens of thousands      jof workmen,who had exhausted their Trade Union benefits,would fall out of insurance.   He had already approached the treasury on their behalf.   In these circumstances itwas dlffloult to justify making grants to Russia.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said he didnot wish to traverse the arguments of the Minister of Labourbut^that so far as he had observed the Press were favourable to the grant.   He agreed that all the Secretary of Statef- for t*2w Colonies had stated about Trotsky and the Red army was true, but held the grant to be justified on humanitariangrounds.   He was in^o-wed by Sir Benjamin Robertson, who had
no 9fa (jil   &apos; !   &apos;     I,just returned from Russia, and who had wide experience ofIndia, that the conditions in Russia were more terriblethan those which prevailed in the worst Indian famine on record.The Secretary of State for India opposed the grant and stated that the attitude of the Press would be far^o^e hostile were they in possession of the Government&apos;sinformation in regard to the Red army and the Soviet&apos;sunmitigated war on civilisation.    There was nothing socalculated to irritate the public as to grant money forforeign purposes while refusing grants to deservingobjects at home.   We had commitments abroad from whichwe could not honourably escape, but we were not committedfo this particular object.The Lord President of the Council expressed the opinionthat if a grant were possible it would be better to makeit to the countries coterminous with Russia&apos;s westernborder .in order to resist the spread of disease from Russia .mhe leapue of Nations had some time ago issued an appeal inthis sense to the Governments of the world, but it had met with little response, and the prophesies of the League asto the spread of disease were not coming true.   It was,however, possible that in the mind of the Prime Minister and the  Foreign Secretary the making of this grant would be of diplomatic advantge in the forthcoming Conference at Genoa.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theproposal had no diplomatic significance in his mind.After further opinions, all hostile to the making ofthe grant, had been expressed, the Cabinet agreed  ?To postpone the question and also that of admitting Russian children until the PrimeMinister could be present,.-4 a -!
? SHIPPING.

(4) With reference to Cabinet 29 (20), Appendix 1, the Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade calling attention to attacks which have been made on British shipping from various parts of the world (Paper C.P. 3776). The most urgent and serious of these was that emanating from the Italian Government, who were endeavouring to drive non-Italian Lines out of the emigration trade, from South Eastern Europe passing through the Adriatic. Similarly, the Germans were endeavouring to restrict our participation in the emigration trade from Northern Europe. In the United States, measures were being taken to establish a mercantile marine at the expense of foreign competitors, and particularly of British shipowners.

 The President of the Board of Trade summarised the case as put forward in his Memorandum, and stated that as ordinary Departmental methods had failed he desired that steps should be taken in particular to approach the Italian Government when a suitable opportunity arose.

 The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs stated that an opportunity would probably arise in connection with the forthcoming negotiations in Paris in regard to Asia Minor.

 The Cabinet agreed ---

 That the Prime Minister, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Chancellor of the Exchequer should take advantage of any suitable occasion, when negotiating with the Italian or other Governments, to bring pressure to bear upon them with a view to securing fair treatment for British shipping.
THE SPANISH (5) With reference to Cabinet 92 (31), Oomlu^lon^after-^bhTARIFF. ^Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Foreign Officedealing ^ith a decision of the Spanish Government to reviseand greatly increase Import Duties on British goods (paper.P.-3588).It was pointed out in the Memorandum that if thenew tariff came into force a serious blow would be dealtat our export tra.de with Spain,, the most effective way ofcountering which would be the threat of a British import prohibition on Spanish fruits, especially oranges.   Sincethe preparation of the Memorandum (December, 1921) negotia-tions had been proceeding at Madrid, and the Spanish Gov-ernment had shown a somewhat more accommodating attitude.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs now asked that he should be authorised to use, in guardeddiplomatic language, a threat of retaliation on our part,commit the Government toHe undertook not to /put the threat into operation withoutthe matter coming again to the Cabinet.The Cabinet were reminded of the economic andpolitical controversies which would immediately ariseshould ft^nt be given to such a threat.The Cabinet agreed  TO authorise the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to threaten the SpanishGovernment with the imposition of ImportDuties against Spanish fruits, on theunderstanding that the Cabinet were not committed to the execution of the threatwithout beinp consulted in advance.
9 9 rhi      si--GETJOJ* Ccn-c (fi) With r*^*rrence to Cabinet IP, &quot;(33), Appendix II,&apos;i:be-C-arbinet agreedTo adjourn the consideration of Papersdealing with the forthcoming GenoaConference until the Prime minister could be present.
&amp; is 0?00T AND-MOUTH     (7) With reference to Cabinet 8 (S2), Conclusion S., thepKsjRASE *Cabinet.had before them the following documentst-Memoranda by the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries (Papers CP.-3730 and cp.-3779).Memoranda by the Minister of HealthfPapers CP.-3757 and CP.-3799) .Memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer (Paper C,P.-3790).The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries reportedthat there was a fall in the number of fresh outbreaks ofthe disease, and that there had been no new districts inwhich the disease had broken out.   The cost to the Stateup to the present was  703,000, of which  651^000 had-been paid in compensation.   The total cost might amount to 1,000,,000, but, great as this sum was, it would, in hisopinion, be a mistake to change the policy adopted by theMinistry of Agriculture.   Where there had been suitable pre-mises, the policy of slaughter had been modified, and hereminded the Cabinet that for 32 years the country hadbeen kept clear of the disease at an average cost of only 11,000 per annum,&apos;   The Minister of Health stated that by Statute thecost fell on the Local Taxation Accountj but no-one had contemplated such a large expenditure becoming necessaryin a single year.   To throw the whole burden at present onthe Rates would evoke a storm of opposition,, especially in urban areas.   He therefore suggested that the incidenceshould be spread over a number of years, the Treasuryborrowing the money required and itself bearing half ofthe cost.^he Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out thatsuch borrowing would be an addition to the debt, andwould have to go into next year&apos;s account.   In view ofthe offer of the Minister of Health to bear half the coston the Local Taxation Account, he was prepared to find t&quot;other half from the Treasury,
The Cabinet took note of and concurred in the arrangement proposed by theChancellor of the Exchequer.
(8) With reference to Cabinet 6 (23), Conclusion 6,the Cabinet had before them, a draft Indemnity (Ireland)plll, a^d Notftfi on its Clauses (Paper CP.-3759).A^ter the Secretary of State for the Colonies had outlined the contents of the Bill, the Cabinet agreed  That the Lord Chancellor should be ashedto examine the Bill, and, if he-concurred in its provisions, that it should be intro-duced by the Chief Secretary for Ireland.
tSwr SFWOTAI-     (9) With ro^rwea to Cabinet 92 (21), Conclusion 53 OWS TABULARY * &quot; *the Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the FinancialSecretary to the Treasury, dealing with the Ulster special constabulary and the period for which the British exchequer should be responsible for contributing to the cost (paper c,P.-3786).    It had been agreed with Sir James Craig to paythe cost o-f the Special Constabulary for the current finance-ial y^ar 1921-22 (estimated at  625,000), and also the cost for the first six months of 1922-23 (estimated at  850,.000),after which the subject would come up again for review. .These payments were justified on the ground that, but fprthe existence of the Special Constabulary, the BritishfVovernment would have to provide additional armed forcesowing to the disturbed relations between Ulster and southern ireland.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he propose^to make provision in the Estimates in a Vote dealing with ageneral grant of money to Ulster for unemployment and other services, so as to avoid, If possible, raising a controversy in Parliament in regard to this Force.The Cabinet agreed  To sanction the procedure indicated bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer.
