(1)With reference to Cabinet 13 (22) Conclusion 6, the Secretary of State for War, as a matter of urgency in view of the forthcoming discussion on the Army Estimates on Wednesday next, raised the question of the number of battalions of the Army to be abolished.

The Committee on National Expenditure had recommended the reduction of 28 battalions, and Mr churchill&apos;s Cabinet Committee on the Report of Sir Eric Geddes&apos; Committee had recommended that this number be reduced to 24 battalions. On recalculating the Army Estimates it had been found that with the expenditure now contemplated it would be possible to maintain an additional two battalions so that the reduction would not exceed 22 battalions in the aggregate. This concession would enable the Army Council to avoid the embarrasssment of being obliged to choose between scrapping two battalions of Guards, two battalions from North Ireland, or two English county battalions.

In this connection the attention of the cabinet was drawn to a Beraorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies on the subject of the disbandment of the Royal Irish Fusiliers, in which he had set forth the objections of the prime Minister of Northern Ireland to the disbanndment in present circumstances of a battalion recruited mainly from the border districts.(CP.3824).

The Cabinet agreed -

(a)To approve the proposal of tho Secretary of State for War that the number of battalion to be reduced should be 22.

(b)That the Secretary of State for War should be authorised, in carrying out this decision, to retain four of the battalions recruited in Northern Ireland, on the understanding


that this decision should apply only for thefinancial year IS 2 - 23(o) That the Secretary of State for iVarshould confer with Sir James Craig as towhich Worth Ireland battalion should be selected for disbandraent*
QRTHCCMtWS C&amp;) With reference to Cabinet 14 iZ2) ,t Conclusion S andOHFFOTOFjj THK Anpen&amp;lx TV, the Cabinet had before tham four &apos;ysmeranda,bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, or Conversationshe had had with Issat Pasha and Yussuf Sternal Bey /on March 10A.and ?*&apos;aron 18, i$S&apos;8 CPapers C*P.-0&amp;S7, S858, 3860 and 3861).THF SF0BF*M$fif OF STAFF FOR POBFE0W AFFAtBS gave to. ........ ...... .the Cabinet an account of the. 0ewersatlons described, inthese Memoranda, the two latter of which&apos; had only readiedmembers of the Cabinet shortly before the meeting.   Theterms put forward by Yussuf Kama! Bey, which included thereturn to Turkey of Thrace as wall as Asia Minor, were &apos;impossible.   At Tussuf iimal Bey*s request lord Carson hadtwit the furssJe^ewtal ar^nciiSiea en which be considered a^v\\u L^i) settlement should be reached.   First, he was prepared to use* \e)X\XAt*t* . 4fifi,,fltsftA with the Greeks to *nalw* a noeeafV-t and voluntary retirement from Asia Minor.,   This condition, how-ever, was dependent on the settlement of the Treaty as awhole,   moreover, there must be guarantees for the Christianpopulation left behind by the Creeks.   Such guaranteeswould be extended reciprocally to Turkish minorities leftunder Creek role.,   Second., the Allies could not surrenderboth shores of the straits of the Dardanelles as well as of the straits of the Marmora.   There were two reasons forthis.   The first was a -military &quot;reasonK   The War office&apos;deemed it out of the question that we should surrender theFuropean shores of the Dardanelles, although the Asiaticshore might be returned to the Turks as part of a wideneddemilitarised aofte.   The second reason was a sentimental,,reason, namely, that the Dominions would not tolerate thereturn ho the Turks of the Calllpoli -Peninsula containing the graves of the mafic who had fought so gallantly there. .Third, the Turks&apos; exist recognise their pre-war debts.
Fourth, thay must recognise the elates arising out of the War, the cost of the Army of Occupation, etc.   Fifth,the Turks must not have a conscript army. LORD CURZON said he had not discussed the boundaries of Thrace, nor the regime to be applied inSmyrna, as this was a matter which would have to be discussed between himself and the Allied Foreign Ministers. On the whole, the Conversation, though friendly, had, he felt, been infructuous. The only hope of a settlement appeared to depend upon union among the three Powers to be represented at Paris. One thing which he bad impressed on the Turkish Delegates was the necessity for an immediate armistice. Otherwise, at any moment while the peace negotiations were in progress, a collision might occur between the hostile forces. Izzet Pasha had appeared quite friendly to this idea, but the Constantinople Government, of course, was not at present fighting with the Greeks. Yussuf Kemal Rey, on the other hand, was rather disturbed at the prospect of an armistice, and Lord Curzon had insisted that he should telegraph the proposal to his Government.The Turkish forces at the present time were being somewhat diminished by desertion, and Yussuf Kemal Bey probably feared that, if once an armistice were agreed to, the Angora army would melt away. In any case, Yussuf Kemal Bey had no power to agree to an armistice, but he (Lord Curzon) thought it probable that one of the first acts of the Paris Conference would be to insist on this, Yussuf Kemal Bey had insisted on the Immediate evacuation of Smyrna by the Greeks. On the subject of  Smyrna by the Greeks. On the subject of the evacuation LORD CURZON said he had seen General Harington, who had evolved, in concert with the Allied Commanders at Constantinople, a very sensible scheme for achieving this. The Greek Army consisted of approximately 200,000 men, and


retirement of this large force was a matter of some difficulty. He thought that the rumoured devastation of the country by the Greeks was very unlikely to occur, and the same applied to the rumoured Venizelist revolution. The proposal of the Allied Commanders was to divide the territory to be evacuated into four zones, and to begin by evacuating the easternmost zone. The retirement was, under this scheme to be supervised by Allied officers. As the forces withdrew the Turkish Civil Administration was to be restored, and a ? was to be set up under Allied officers. The whole evacuation was to occupy ? months. The necessary shipping was available. The Turkish army was to be under the surveillance of Allied officers, who would see that as soon as the Greeks had withdrawn the Turkish forces were demobilised.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR interpolated at this moment that the plan drawn up by the Allied Generals under General Harington had not been agreed to in all its details by the General Staff. In particular, they objected to sending Biritish officers as far as Afiun Karahissar.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR F0REIGN AFFAIRS said he had not committed himself to this particular plan. He had seen General Thwaites with General Harington, and was aware that the General Staff had certain objections.   The whole question would probably be remitted to Marshal Foch&apos;s Committee.

In regard to the procedure at Paris, THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS thought that his task was very difficult, and bis prospect of achieving success remote. He recalled the consistent and almost treacherous attitude of the French. There was reason to believe that all the British views, if communicated to the French Government, were passed on to the Turks, and General Pelle and the
Ul eM**l THE SECRETARY OP STATE POP FOREIGN AFFAIRS, continuing,i&apos;^ ffidsiAfntt  s aid that another sinister feature was the increasingcloseness between Angora and the Bola hevika . Referring tobis Memoranda, ho pointed out that he bad done bis bestfor oar policy in Mesopotamia.   Yusauf Kemal Bey had begun-with       usual formula in regard to the conformity of interests between Grwat Britain and the Angora Turks.lord Cur son bad asked him how he reconciled this withth*? rapprochement to the Bolsheviks, fror whom the BritishGovernment  differed widely.   Ynsanf Kemal Bey had repliedthat the Bolsheviks recognised the community of economic(TTf)        and social  conditions between the two countries *   lordrest totamia.       Gtirson then asked him what he was doing with Bolshevistmoney, and he had replied that it was being spent for defence.   Lord Gursson had anted him against whom thisdefence was? to be provided?   Was it a gains&apos;- the Greeks?Certainly not, because the present Conference was being held to consider how the Greeks were to he extricated-from Smvrua.   ?er* Cur son had continued that he had heardpe Turkish armies threatening the Kosi.il region.   He hadwarped Ynssuf Kemal Bey that if British interests were attacked the attack vronld be resisted with all the forceof the Empire.For tho reasons set forth above, LQRB GORDON said hewould he ROlrg to Paris with but little hope of completesuccess, though he intended to yield as little as possible.
Re thought it necessary that, the Foreign Ministers shouldcontinue sitting until they reached an agreement, whichwist he nut in writing.   There would not he time to3P*?Q0hstruet the Treatv of Sevres   and the Agreement shouldrelate to principles only.   This Agreement should then besent both to the Greeks and to the &quot;^urks, who should beasked for their views and should be invited, to state them at. c ( vi ) *sv meetirc in Constantinople   where they should-frjs r^e^ived hy the Commissioners of the Powers.   An armis-tiee should also be asked for.   If the replies were favour-able, the Greek evacuation of &quot;Smyrna should begin at once.Be thoucht it would be inadvisable for the Prime Minis ter sor Foreis-fn Ministers to meet at Constantinople, a?, itwould m*wy do to me**t a. rebuff there.    If the proposalsn? the Powers were re lee ted * there would have ^o he awaetlW of the Snnreme Council, or a fresh meeting ofForeign Ministers.   STe felt, however, that once an armisticecould be arranged, there was a chance of reaching somesettlement.
THE SJ5C1.&amp;TAKY OF STAT&amp; FOfi Tiki COLOfiliS said thatall must have sympathy with Lord Curzon in his task.At the moment we were liquidating an immense disasterfor which we were not entirely fee from responsibility.The signature of the Treaty of Sevres had bean one of themost unfortunate events in the history of tiie world.Mo means had existed for enforcing it.     The resulthad been that we had aroused in a Power that had been at our feet, a spirit which we now had no means to combat.Consequently, the Foreign Secretary had to do his beat in very difficult circumstances.     The Greeks were exhausted,worn out, bankrupt.     The Smyx*na    vilayet which had existed for three years in utter misery was agin tobe abandoned to the Turks.     We had no leverage withthe Turks, whereas the Turks had a leverage to use against us in the threat to Mosul.     There the turks had the means of wrecking our policy without any great effort.      If   Lord Curzon came b&amp;E.C from Pariswithout a peace, he himself did not know what advicehe could give to the Cabinet.     He had always said thathe could not hold. Mesopotamia without peace on itsborders.     If there were no peace, it was very likely that there would arise a pressure on Mesopotamia, whichwould drive us out.     The Turks recognised the BritishEmpire as their great enemy.     At one time they would haveta&amp;en anything from us, but we had rejected them and nowthey had in their hands an easy means to inflicthumiliation upon us and to complete the destruction ofour policy in Mesopotamia.     He had been glad to hearLord Curzon say that the Pact was a lever to use withthe French.     That was very strongly his view, confinedthough the Pact was within narrow limits.
LORD CURZON interpolated that what the Foreign Office had always objected to and still objected to was an alliance with France and not a limited pact of guarantee. 

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES, continuing said that he hoped the Cabinet would realise that our policy in regard to Turkey had resulted in achieving the impossible, namely the marriage of the Bolshevists and the Turks in spite of the entire conflict of principles between them. This greatly increased our difficulties.

LORD CURZON pointed out that this union was inevitable when the decision had to be taken to abandon the Caucasus. He had foreseen it at the time.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES said his view had always been that our proper line was an easy policy towards Turkey and a stiff policy towards the bolshevists. We had adopted exactly tae contrary        course, with ? results which were now visible.

He asked whether India was to be represented at the Paris Conference. He felt she was entitled to this by her sacrifices in the War against Turkey. Lord Curzon, owing to the private letter which Mr. Montagu by his action had compelled him to make public, was regarded in India as hostile. He asked, therefore, if the new Secretary of State for india, could not go to Paris as a Delegate with Lord Curzon, or possibly. Some Indian might be found to accompany him.

THE LORD PRIVY SEAL pointed out that the new Secretary of State for India would have difficult domestic Indian problems to deal with and could hardly go away during his first week in office.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR agreed with the Secretary of State for the Colonies that some demonstration should be made to indicate that India was being.


represented.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS pointed out that the Paris meeting was to be attended only by foreign Ministers who would be accompanied by their Private Secretaries. No-one else would be in the room. He strongly resented any suggestion of lack of impartiality on his part. He pointed out that throughout he had been absolutely impartial between the Turks and Greeks. He was not going to Paris to a speak against the interests of India or in favour of the Greeks. He had no more right to take an Indian with him to Paris than a representative of a Dominion who wished to put an opposite point of view. He would do his best in the difficult circumstances, for which he himself was not responsible.

THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that all present must recognise that the situation of the Foreign secretary was a very difficult one, He had no cards in his hand and the few he had had already been played by some-one else. He was not quite clear, however, how far Lord Curzon was prepared to go in order to secure peace.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said he might have to make some concessions. He thought is was essential to get some kind of settlement but M. Sehanzer had to return to Rome on the 27th March as the King of the Belgians was visiting Rome on March 29th.

His idea was that the evacuation of Asia Minor should be accompanied by the establishment of some regime in Smyrna under Turkish sovereignty to provide for non-Turkish races. He himself would be glad to see this regime set up under the auspices of the League of Nations. He thought this was not impossible, provided Turkish sovereignty remained, as Eastern nations attached great


importance to the flag.     The Storks had &quot;suggested an exchange of population between Greeks in Smyrna and&quot;Turks elsewhere but this was hardly feasible.     Theprotection of minorities, however, ought not to presentinsuperable difficulties and resort might be had to tneLeague of Nations in this, more particularly as theLeague had certain responsibilities for this in con-neotlon With the European Treaties.     As regards the4n^t/w*-a^ (%)    Armenians, he despaired of doing much for them.     Atthe present moment there was an Armenian Republic iniSrivan which had adopted Soviet principles and was safefor the moment.   . iie would like to persuade the Turksto increase the size of this state.     An alternative was a scheme for an Armenian Republic in Silesia, buthe thought there was no chance of the Turks accepting this.     As regards financial control, he would give theTurks a large measure of independence.SAGE. (ZJ) .    The two main difficulties related to the starits and, to Thrace.      In regard to Thrace, the difficulty was &quot;that the Greeks were in possession.     Supposingthe Allies were do accept the Turkish National Pact,who, he asked, would be able to turn the Greeks out ofThrace?     They had there hii army of 70,000 men.     More-over, the moment the Allies withdrew from Constantinople,the ^resits would slip ih.     That was something the turks had to tear in mind and did provide some sort of a lever.To taie consideration must be added the military aspect ofthe question.     The War Office, as he had already meritioned,would not hear of returning the European shores of theDardanelles to the Turks.     ^either would tae Dominions,for sentimental reasons.     Consequently, he felt he must put up the best fight he could for retaining the greeks in Thrace, with the Allies occupying the
forts in tlie Gallipoli Peninsula.     If tae frontiers of Turkey were extended to the Bulgarian frontier, thewhole Balkan question would be re-opened.     Hence, Shracewas the most difficult question.THE MXIilSTISB OF HS1BTH pointed out that theForeign Secretary&apos;s position was, perhaps, not so bad.Supposing he achieved nothing and the Greeks and Turkswere left to fight it;out, Great Britain would sufferno loss of prestige.     Even assuming the &quot;worst, if wewere attacked in Mesopotamia, this country was merelyunder a British mandate and waa not part of the BritishUmpire.THiS SEOBETABY OF STATS FOB FOBElGtf AFFAIBS pointedout that one of his difficulties was that the Greeksat Paris had been invited by the Allies to go to Smyrna,later on they had fought for the Allies and fought verygallantly.      Consequently, it was impossible for us towash our hands of the Greeks and leave them to theirfate.THE SECBETABY OF STATE FOB THIS COLOiillaS pointedout that if the worst came to the worst, the Britishmight have to evacuate Mesopotamia.     An even more serious matter would be the evaeiiation of Gallipoli.     He would   ,rather have a continuance of a state of war, or at anyrate of disturbance, even involving the evacuation ofMesopotamia, than to return the mastery of the Straitsto the Turits.TEE MIJMSTBB FOB EDUCATION agreed in this.THE LOBS PBXVY SEAL suggested that B was not worthwhile to run risiis in order to secure tae acknowledgmentby the Turks of their obligation to pay the cost of the armies of occupation.     In any case, tney would never be abs to pay anything.THE SECBETABY OF STATE FOB FOBEIGU AFFAIBS agreed.
THE LORD PRIVY SEAL asked if it was worth while pressing very strongly about the abandonment of conscription.

THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS pointed out that this would raise the question in Bulgaria, Hungary and Austria. Everywhere the abolition of conscription had been resisted and everywhere we had refused to give way. He felt that the only chance for the miserable inhabitants of Turkish territory and the only prospect of peace in these regions lay in the abolition of conscription. If conscription was maintained, then the invasion of Mesopotamia would come in due course.

THE LORD PRIVY SEAL expressed doubt as to whether we could achieve it.

At the conclusion of the discussion the SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR begged Lord Curzon to be very careful to incur no additional military responsibilities.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said the fully realised the importance of this.

THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said he thought that the discussion could not usefully be carried further.

The Cabinet left the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs full discretion to do his best at Paris on the general lines he had indicated, and in accordance with the general intentions of the Cabinet as revealed in the course of the discussion.


&amp;XFEGDAKDIHG (3) With reference to Cabinet 70 (21)OP IHDUSTSPSSACT PART II. Conclusion ls  the Cabinet bad before them amemorandum by the President ox the Board of Trade,dealing with the enforcement of Part II of the safeguarding of Industries Act (CP.3852).THE PBES3XDEHT OP rIME B0AB1) CP TP APE explainedthat Seven reports had been received from committees which had been dealing with complaints under Part ii of the Act, four of these reports being in favour ofeaid three adverse to the applicants industries.In the cs,se of fabric gloves and glove materialsthe committee&apos;s report was unanimously in favour ofthe applicants and the direction of the Cabinet was now required on the- question whether or not theBoard of Trade should exeraise its powers to make an Order under the Act*      Inas much as it would bethe first of such orders under Part II considerable interest was being shewn in the case as -it would indicate the Government&apos;s general attitude to rartlie      Strong representations had been made on behalfof the Lancashire fine cotton spinners against themaking of such Order on the ground that if a dutyis placed upon German fabric gloves the Germanmanufacturers, who up to the present have boughttheir fine cotton yarn mainly from Lancashire, maydivert their purchases to Prance.     However fcfcpSnKgroundless this fear it could not be denied taa^ it-was real and might have considerable political *-&quot;ifectby provoking anew old tariff controversies.    He(Mr Baldwin)  thought it quite probable that  to ,iakethe Order would cost the Government many votes buthe saw no alternative other than to administer theAct.In the course of the discussion which followed/r
it was pointed out that in the case of gloves thecommittee&apos;s report was unanimous end unhesitating and thatthe arguments against its application was simply the fear of some hypothetical action by the Germans, uponwhom we could bring very heavy diplomatic pressure andwho in any ease could only impose retaliatory ditties byviolating the terms of the Treaty of Versailles.     On theother hand, very general expression was given to the in-expedlency of proceeding at the present moment to fomentagitation by taking action on behalf of a very minor indus-try affecting only a few thousand out workers and therbyupsetting so large and powerful an interest as that of theLancashire spinning&apos;trade.    The workers in this trade, itswas emphasied, had greatly suffered during the war, and since the war despite continuous and systematic short time they had shewn great reluctance to have recourse to the PoorLaw,       further, the imposition of a duty of thirty three and one-third percent for two or three years could not beregarded as effectively meeting the collapse in the exchangeThe question was then raised as to whether thePresident of the Board of Trade had legally any discretion in the matter of making: an Order and whether &quot;may&quot; make anOrder in the Act did not in fact moan &quot;must&quot; make an Order.The Cabinet agreed -)a) That the President of the Board of Tradein reply to   -uostions in Parliament should state that the reports oi the committee worestill under consideration.(fa) That the president&apos; of the Board of Trade should consult the Law Officers on the point oi&apos; theinterprotlofcon oi&apos; his powers under the Actwhether permissive or obligatory, with a view tofurther consideration of the matter by theC&amp;cabinet.fC
(4) uith reference to Cabinet 38(22.) Conclusion 5,the Cabinet had before them a note by the lord president of the Council covering a draft replyto the League of Nations on the question of theSecond Assembly&apos; &amp; Kecoiamen da t ions for the limitationof Expenditure on Armaments.    (CP.3850).ShsiCabinet agreed to the terms of thelOraft Letter arid authorised the Presidentof the -Board of Education to sign itsubject to the following amendment proposedby the first Lord of the Admiralty:-Paragraph II to dead -I am happy to be able to inform you that the further economies foreshadowed in tho reply of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentdated June 2nd 1921, to the similarrecommendation of the First Assembly,have proved capable of realisationand th.e forthcoming Estimates to be presented to -Parliament of their national expenditure on armamentswill demonstrate the very considerablereductions in all directions provided forduring the next financial year.
