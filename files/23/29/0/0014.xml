-THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRIT ANN IG MAJESTY &apos;S G0vTSR%MfffT.r*      . CABINET.INTERNATIONAL LABOUR ORGANISATION .Instructions to the British Government Representative on theGoverning Body of the International Labour organisation.MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF LABOUR.EEORET^ 1.     A question has arisen as to the future composition of thejy oP *8767 .     Governing Body of the International Labour Organisation.     Itspresent constitution (as set out in the Appendix) has given dis-satisfaction on the three grounds -(a) that interest in the work of the Organisation is restrictedbecause of the non-representation of smaller countries and non-European States;(b) that the present constitution tends to give a socialist blooconsisting of continental workers and Government representa-tives of smaller States an undesirable predominance;(c) that the list of the eight States of chief industrialimportance should be revised.2.     Attempts have been made to meet the first and last points byre-arrangcments within the terms of Article 393 of the Treaty ofVersailles.     These re-arrangements will be considered at theYnext Session of the General Conference of the Organisation, butit is.plain that a more permanent settlement involving Treatyrevision will bo pressed for and is desirable,3.     This settlement would probably involve an increase in the size of the Governing Body from 24 to 32 (i.e. 16 government representatives, 8 Employers and 8 Workers) and representation of governments at any rate on a geographical basis.-   I am inclined to support a proposal for a revision of tho Treaty in this direc-tion, because if properly adjusted it might remove the difficul-ties mentioned.4.     I accordingly propose, unless any dissent is expressed by my colleagues, to support a proposal to revise the Treaty as suggested above.Ministry.of Labour .(Sgd.) T.J. MAONAMARA.22nd February, 1922

QCMMUN.ICATIOS TO EB ADDRESSED TO THE SULTANBY THE EIGH 001*11 SSI OESR.Your Highnessi-1. I hare tho honour to bring to Your Highness1snotice that certain passages of tho explanatory note whichI addressed to you on 3rd December, 1921, were Interpreted,to my great disappointment, in a manner not in accordancewith the intention and policy of His Majesty1 s Government.2. Judging by many comments whioh have been published on the subject of this note, it vn uld appearthat many Egyptians were under the impression that GreatBritain was about to abandon her liberal and favourableattitude towards Egyptian aspirations,  and to make useof her special position in Egypt in order to maintain apolitical and administrative regime incompatible with thefreedom she had offered.3&apos;. Such an interpretation of the intentions ofHis Majesty1s Government was quite mistaken.     On theGon tr ary, the explanatory note emphasised the dominatingprinciple that the guarantees claimed by Great britain are not designed to involve tho continuance of an actual or virtual protectorate.      Great Britain,  as it is statedtherein,  sincerely desires to pee &quot;an Egypt oirgqying thenational prerogatives., and the international position ofa sovereign state.&quot; ;      - .; .4. If Egyptians have, regarded -these .guarantaesas being out of keeping with the position of a free countrythey have,  on the other hand,  lost sight of the fact that&apos; Great/. - i   &quot; &quot;&quot;. &quot;&quot;    *&quot; &quot;   &quot;   &apos;   -
Great Britain has been obliged -to oil am them out of consi&amp;era-tion for her. own security in face of-a situation which demandsgreat prudence on her part, particularly in the matter of -the disposition of her troops.     present wo rid conditions, however,and the state of effervesoen.ee which -has prevailed in Egyptsince. tho&apos; armistice are hot permanent factors^ and it is tohe hoped-that.while,  on the one hand,  the former will eventuallyimprove,  on the other hand, the time will come when, in the language of that note, Egypt&apos;s record will give confidence in her own guarantees.5. As to any desire to interfere in the internal administration of,Egypt,- His. Ma^edty*.s Government have .sufficiently,stated-,and repeat., that their most ardentdesire is to plaoe In Egyptian hands the conduct of their own affairs.   .. The -draft agreement proposed by Great Britain didnot depart from this -idea-,: and in making provision for thepresence of two British- -&apos;.,-officials&apos;., in the Ministries of Pin uncoand Justice,  it was- dot her intention to use those twoofficials for - the- purpose of intervening in Egyptian affairshut solely in order -to preserve the contact requisite forprotecting, foreign interests..6.     &apos;   Such is,.-the sole bearing of the guarantees that were demanded by .Great Britain.&apos;.     They were claimed without,any desire to vimpede Egyptians enjoying the full -rights of&quot;a national Government,.7. Animated as she is -with these intentions., it ...... .       &apos;will be understood that it is repugnant to Great Britain onthe one baud to see Egypt! an s -delay by their own -acts, the .realisation/&apos;   --2 k   W;M       *
roalisatioa of an Ideal aimed at by both parties, and ontbe other to bo eompolled herself to intervene to re-establish order when it is threatened in suoh a way as to arouse the fears of foreigners and to involve the interestsof foreign Powers.      It would be ranch to be regretted ifEgyptians should see in the exceptional measures which haverecently boon taken any prejudice to the ideal to which theyaspire ar an intention on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto alter the palioy I have indicated.      In taking these measures, the sole desire of His Majesty1 s Government hasbeen to put an end to a harmful agitation whioh by arousingpopular passions might have suoh consequences as to jeopardise the whole result of tho efforts of the Egyptian nation.    Thesameasures were taken primarily in the interest of the Egyptiancause, whioh has everything to gain by being studied&apos; in an atmosphere of calm and friendly discussion.8. How that tranquillity seems to be re-establishingitself thanks to the wise spirit which is the root of theEgyptian character and asserts itself in times of crisis,I am happy to be able to announce to Your Highness that HinMajesty&apos;s Government are prepared to recommend the accompany-ing Declaration for the approval of Parliament.^   This will,I am confident, establish a regime of mutual confidence andlay the foundation for a satisfactory and final solution ofthe Egyptian problem.9. There is no obstacle to the re-establishment   ,forthwith of an Egyptian Ministry for Foreign Affairs whichwill prepare the way for the creation of the diplomat ic/-and/
ft - f;tand consular representation of Egypt.10.    . Tho creation of a parliament with a right tooqntrol the policy and administration of a constitutionallyresponsible government is a matter for Tour Highness and theEgyptian people to determine. Should circumstances arise to delay tho coming into;force of the ^ct of Indemnity withapplication to. all inhabitants of Egypt mentioned in thedeclaration accompanying this note, I desire to inform your highness that I shall be prepared, pending tho repeal of &quot;the proclamation of the 2nd November, 1914, to suspend the applica-tion of Martial Law in respect, of all matters affecting thefree exercise of - the political- rights of Egyptians...11.  .      It is now for Egypt to respond, and it is to be hoped she.will justly&apos; appreciate the good intentions of GreatBritain, and that reflection and not passion will guide herattitude.
&quot;vhereas His Majesty&apos;s Government,  in accordance with their declared ,intentions, desire forthwith to recognise-Egypt as. an independent sovereign State, and -   . -The relations between His Lia jest,v &apos; s Government and .Egypt we . of vital interest to. the. British .Empire.; .The following principles are hereby declared;-., The British Protectorate, over Egypt is .terminated,and Egypt is declared to be an independent sovereign state. . ,So So soon as the Government of His Highness shall passan -*ct of Indemnity with application to all inhabitants of Egypt,  martial law as proclaimed on the End ofJHevem;jer 1914,  shall be withdrawn.-3, The following matters are absolutely reserved to the discretion of His Majesty&apos;s Government until such time as it may bo possible by free discussion and friendlyaccommodation on both sides to oonclude agreements inregard thereto between   His Jte jesty&apos;&apos;s Government andthe Government of Egypt.(ti)   The security of the communications of the british Bop Ire in j*gypt;fb)    The defence of Egypt against all, foreignaggression or interference, direct or indirectj,(o)    The protection of foreign Interests in egypt and the protection of minorities&apos;;(d)    The Sudan-.,Pending the conclusion of such agreements, thestatus, quo In all these matters :shall remain intact.Whereas1*DECMEaT LOB TO EGYPT .

Secretary of secretary of State  ox-Foreign Affairs,/Field Marshal Viscount Allenby.G.C.B, jGcCMaGo , HighCommissioner for Egypt.Sir Maurice Hankey,--G.CB.,Sir Edward Grigg4K.CV.C ,CM.G0,D.S.O.GYPT. ;i,        THE PRIME MINISTER explained that he had summonedthis meeting in order to arrange exactly how to carry out-the policy decided on at- the Cabinet on Friday, the 17thinstant conformably with the pledges made to Parliament.He then read the following answer he had given to aquestion in Parliament on October 27th, 1921:-&quot;With regard to the last part, myHonourable Friend may rest assured thatno change will be made in the relation between this country and Egypt without adequate opportunities being given fordiscussion by Parliament.&quot;and the following answer given on November 10th, 1921:-&quot;Undoubtedly Parliament will have to be consulted in any important change in ourrelations with Egypt.     Anything donewill be with the sanction of Parliament;but it is quite impossible for theForeign Secretary to oon&amp;feared negotiationsif every suggestion put forward is to besubmitted to Parliament.11
The Prime Minister pointed out that on the one hand itwould he very awkward if the policy wero announced beforeLord Allenhy had communicated it to the Sultan of Egypt,&quot;but on the other hand, after he had communicated it tothe Sultan,yit would be difficult to change the policy;In fact, it would be Lord Allenbjr1 s last offer.Consequently, the final offer would have been&apos;made beforeParliament ha&amp; been consulted.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL recalled the&apos;criticisms that had been made in the House of Commons as -to the fulfil-ment of Government pledges on other questions and laid stress on the importance of arranging a &quot;-procedure that could not be criticised in this respect.LORD OJRZON,asked by the Prime Minister to give his ideas of the procedure, said it&quot; was that some sort of general sketch of the policy should be given inParliament the same day.    Then Lord Allenby would returnto Egypt taking with him his draft letter to the Sultan,with the Government&apos;1 s Declaration as an Annox, and would present it to the Sultan of Egypt,    He hoped and antici-pated that Lord Allenby would be in a position to say .that he had not only presented the letter, but thatSarwat Pasha had succeeded in forming a Ministry,Siiuiltaneously,* the &quot;document.&quot; would be presented toParliament.     There.: would then&apos;be a- debate, &quot;in both  &apos;- &apos; y &apos;Houses.   The only doubt he felt was as to the - situationif Lord Allenby should not&apos; succeed in forming a Ministry,Then a/moree difficult situation would arise, for Itwould be absurd, to ask Parliament to agree to a policy &apos;when no Egyptian Ministry would carry it out.   He hadconaiderable hope, however,. that this situation wouldnot arise.     He felt that it was very important to be An
,a position to announce to Parliament that an EgyptianMinistry was &quot;being formed at the same time as the policy was being oomaunieatedo     He presumed that in Parliament,the approval of the policy would be moved by resolution.He thoiight by this means every pledge would be fulfilled,.    THE PRIME MINISTER recalled that in the draft ofthe letter- forwarded in his telegram Hd. If of January 121CP. 3614-, No.4. - Lord Allenby had included the following-phrase -i- &apos;MWith this object in view I am happy to be ableto announce to Your Highness that Hie-Majesty: government are prepared to. reootrgaextd to, british parliament t without waiting for, conclusion Ofa Treaty, abolition of Protectorate andrecognition of Egypt as an independent SovereignStatedThat sentence had dropped out of the new draft letter .   Ifit were re-inserted it would merely inform the Sultan thatthe   British Government were prepared to recommend thispolicy to Parliament,      In this way the Governmentss pledgwould be fulfilled.LOPJJ allenby agreed that there was no objection tothis., &apos; - THE PRIMS MINISTER suggested that the sameCommittee as had drafted the now letter and the GovernmentDeclaration, namely1 j Sir Edward Grigg. Mr. Murray andGnaeral Clayton *  should meet in order to re-insert this phrase.The Ministers then discussed the question of whenthe announcement should be made in the House of Commons..LORD allenby said he expected to be able to hand the Declaration to the Sultan neoct Monday afternoon andit was arranged that the announcement in both Houses ofParliament should be made on Tuesday afternoon -Pebruary 28th.
TBS LORD FRIVYlSSAL undertook to arrange that if necessary,a fray should be given for the discussion in tho House ofCommons on -Wednesday, March 1st.LORD CUR3ON raised the question of what would happen if Sarwat Pasha, should decline to form a Ministry..   ,. ... ..LORD ALLSNBY thought that probably Sarwat Pasha wouldnot decline, but in that event he hoped he would be able tofind someone el so to form a Ministry.THE. PRIME MINISTER remarked that if no Ministry was formed, lord; Allenby would govern according to tho -status quo, ... ;The conclusions of the Conference may be summarisedas follows:-fa) In order to oarry out tho policy approved by. the Cabinet cabinet 10 (22)conclusion 2)consistently with pledges given to Parliament. the.following Committee:-   ........    Sir Edward Grigg,&quot;&quot;    ; Mr *&apos; Murray of the Foreign Office.Genoral Clayton..&apos; .... .        should meet-the same day In order to insert inthc letter to be sent by lord Allenby. to thoSultan, words similar to those usod in lord allenby&apos;s original draft letter of January 12th,... .,      to. show that tho policy set forth in the .Declaration to Parliament (Cabinet 10 (22),..Appendix. ). was one which His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwas prepared to recommend to Parliament.(b) That the Declaration should bo communicated to the Sultanby the High Commissioner immediately on his returnto Egypt, that is to sayt on Monday,February 27th.(o) Tho policy should be announced In both Houses   ...of Parliament on Tuesday February 23th.(d) The Lord Privy Seal should arrange for a day to&apos;be given to- the discussion on Egypt if desired; .&apos;     by the House of Commons, on Wednesday, March 1st.(e) If the High Commissioner is unable, to form an.    Egyptian Ministry on the basis of this policy,he should oontinuo to govern the country&apos; as. . at, present.
? THE ? THEM IN ?.

2. LORD ALLENBY then, raised some minor points on which he Wished to have guidance.

 LORD ALLENBY said that on his official appearances in public, he was accorded a guard of Honour, and the band usually played the first five bars of "God Save the King." He presumed that it would be advisable to continue this,

 LORD CURZON agreed that he should do so.

? OFFICIAL ? ON THE SULTAN.

3. LORD ALLENBY said that the practice was for the Sultan to call on him on the King&apos;s birthday, while he called on the Sultan on the Accession Day and on the Sultan&apos;s birthday; thus he called twice and the Sultan called once.

 LORD CURZON said that anything that maintained the High Commissioner&apos;s prestige should be continued, and that there should he no change in this procedure.

PUBLIC HOLIDAY ? THE KING&apos;S BIRTHDAY.

4. LORD ALLENBY said that at present King&apos;s birthday was a public holiday in Egypt. This rather brought the Protectorate into prominence and was repugnant to many Egyptians.

 LORD CURZON agreed with Lord Allenby that it might be desirable to drop this public holiday as there were ample other public holidays, but he thought Lord Allenby should not do so on his own initiative but only if asked to do so.

 LORD ALLENBY said he only wanted general guidance on this point and might have to refer for instructions later.

VISITS TO THE RACES.

5. LORD ALLENBY said that if he went to the races, the procedure was for him to go first and be received by the Guard and five bars of the National Anthem. The Sultan
llOMATICITS.arrived later and was. reoeived with the Khedivial Anthem*The Sultan lef&apos;t first to-the strains of the Khedivial An themand,Lord Allsaby left afterwards when five &quot;bars of the.National Anthem ..were played.   He presumed that this procedure should continue .LOBE; CURS OH agreed that it should.6.     LORD AILMBY said it was his custom as HighCommissioner to1 sond for tho French or. Italian Minis torsand not to visit them.   He presumed that this shouldcontinue in order to show that the British High Commissionerwas tho senior foreign representative.LORD CURZOS agreed that this, should be. the case.58, Whitehall Gar dons, S.W*1.20th February, 1922.

The Conference had before them the&apos;following-documents relating to the situation in Iraq and more-particularly in the northern region of Mosul:-Memo: by the Secretary of State for thoColonies - CP, 3328.Memo: by the Secretary of State for War -CP. 3395-Memo: by the Secretary of State for War *c,p, 3494.Memo: by the Secretary of State for War -CP, 3708.Memo: by the Secretary of State for War *CP. 3717oThe Secretary of State for War gave-the conference a summary of the situation as presented in these papers-;Arising out of the negotiations for the transfer of theresponsibility for garrisoning Mesopotamia from thoWar Office to the Air Ministry, the latter department had asked that-two white battalions should be left at baghdad.     The General Staff had advised that this wasunsafe unless the communications of these troops by railway and river were secured, which would require twoAs the Colonial Office were unwilling tmore battalions.cay for the latter troops/the War Office had been unable to consent toleave either thosetws battalions or any other unitssuGh as armoured cars and machine gun units.     Theywere, however,, ready to transfer to the Air Ministrysuch troops as might volunteer . for. this service.     Atpresent the Secretary of State continued, the War&apos;.&apos; or.&apos;&apos;Office assumed no responsibility for reinforcing/ res-cuing&apos;    any forces of the Air Ministry which might become besieged in Baghdad or elsewhere in Mesopotamia,This he regarded as an unsound posit ion,&quot; for if trouble-occurred- the-British Sat i oh -would certainly insist. on- a- relief -expedition&apos; and there would bo a repetitionsiege of Gordon inof the situation at the time of the   / Khartoum..
The latest request from the Air Ministry, Sir 1*,WOrth-ington-JSvans otoaiiimed, had been for the retentionof an armourod. car unit in the region of Mosul.     Aftersummarising the strategical situation in this region and the danger   of attack by the Turks in combination.with        Tribal rising as set forth by the General .--&apos; for WarStaff in CP. 3708 the Secretary of State/urged thatthere should be a -withdrawal to the area about&apos; B&amp;srjaJh,thereby effecting a saving of  5* 000,000 per annOae osda great reduction, in liabilities,,The Secretary of State for the Colonies reminded his oolleagues that 5,0CO.,000 per annum had alreadybeon saved on this year&apos;s estimates and that the costdf:-,the whole administration of Ircjo. had been reduced to 7*500,000 for the ensuing yee.r.     The country was notat present seriously disturbed, and the actual loss in white personnel during tho last   twelve months wasonly three officers!     The policy in regard to ourposition, in Mesopotamia was to maintain order by meansof native levies supported by powerful Air Forcersconcentrated.in a loop of the river close to Baghdad.also order,&apos;whero/thes forces would maintain/    In the year1.923-24 it was hoped to reduce the cost to  3 - 4,000;OCXa. year.   . By that time it. was not unreasonable to anticipate that trade would begin to develop in these regions.     Mr. Churchill made it perfectly clear that.the permanent arrangements as described above were insufficient, to resist an invasion by the Turks, but&apos;there was no evidence that an   invasion was contemplatedduring the&apos;next two months.     Ultimately it was hoped
to maintain tlie position by strengthening .the Arabsystem: against the Turkish system.,     Tho Arab levies--which provided a screen between Mosul and the Turkishfrontier, were not as yet a force to be relied on for serious resistance, though they had been engaged inminor operations,!     After reference to the difficulties and delays in arranging with the War Office for the ancillary services required in Mesopotamia by theRoyal Air Force the Secretary of State for the Goloni.esstated that he was. prepared, if the Cabinet insisted,to come out of Mesopotamia, but his Advisors were unanimous that the situation might be maintained bythe policy summarised above.,    As we had already spentso... ouch In Mesopotamia he considered it would be apity to give it up at present when we were in sight ofestablishing an independent Arab State and of fulfillingour obligations under the Mandate we had aooepted.then it was/pointed out that an immediate withdrawal of theforces from Mosul would increase the arrogate of the kemalists and prejudice the position of the foreign secretary at the forthcoming Paris Conference where itwas hoped to arrange. terms acceptable to- both Turksand Greeks;      If the result cf the Conference was satisfactory the danger of Turkish attacks- on NorthernMesopotamia, would be renoved and. &amp;3te: time would begiven for the Arab Army and levies to develop.The Conference noted that the War Office objected to the Air Ministry raising ground troops sinceunnecessary duplication of Army units would thereby boinvolved;    attention was. however drawn to the fact
that the Colonial Office maintained forces in Africa overv-hich the;- had complete control and it was suggested thata solution &apos; might be found by the Colonial Office raisingsome s jocial units, of gondar-rv-rio for tho maintenanceof order in Baghdad -and other places in the &quot;rioinixyof aerodromes aAfter some further discussion the conference agreed that:(1)    Provision should be made in the Iran &apos;estimates for 1922/23 for two whitebattalions,  or thai1&quot; equivalent  (inaddition, to the four Indian battalions),,(2)    Tho Far Office &apos; should render everyassistance to the Air Ministry in the taking over by the Air &quot;Ministry of suchunits an-d individuals of the army ancillary-services as might be required by theRoyal Air force ,(3)    Part of the existing garrison and Armoured .Gar Company should remain at Mosul and thetwo white battalions at Baghdad until theconclusion of the forthcoming Conference onthe Turco-Greek Peace,    Their further re ten tichowever should in any event be reconsideredbefore May 1st,  1922c(4)    The Air Ministry should continue&apos; .     raising such armoured ear unitsas they require, for service inMesopotamia or Palestine with the proviso that this should in no way prejudice any future discussion by the Cabinet on the gsner-al questionof the -responsibilities of the royal navy, the Army and the Royal AirForce.(5) - No steps should ho taken to raise an infantry force under the Air Ministryat the present tine*2, Whitehall Gardens; S ,&quot;M c9th February,  1922,

(1)   Arising out of a reference to the recent bloodshedon the frontier between Northern and Southern Ireland,  theConference &quot;had an- informal dis oust, ion &apos;.on the prospects in  ,.Parliament of the Bill to be introduced this week to giveeffect to the Irish Treaty,The Lord Chancellor -undertook to arrangefor the Attcrney-u-eretral to fiirnlsb m-? I.erialto the Lord Privy -Seal -to assist. I idru in preparing his speech in support of the Bill,..(2)   With reference to a;Conference, of Ministers holdon February 9, 1922,  the PRIME MINISTER stated that the debate on India in the Rouse of Commons on the following day was of great importance..    He proposed that the Secretaryof State for India should open the discussion by &amp; full statement of the general position in India,   and that he himself should intervene later in order to affirm emphatic-ally the determination of the British Government to maintainBritish rule in India and to meet any challenge to oursupremacy with all the forces at cur disposal.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL stated that he was struck withthe.(&apos;unfairness of&quot; the criticisms directed against theSecretary of State for India, which were mainly due toignorance.     An Idea was prevalent that, as joint authorwith Lord Chelmsford of the rrcent reforms; he was en expon-ent of an anti-British&quot;policy In India,.    He thought it essential.that Mr. Montagu should make clear exactly what his intentions were and how.far he intended to go in intro-duclng those reforms,.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested  that Mr.  Montagu should read to the Conference the important -passages from his speech- regarding our policy In India,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR - INDIA explained thedifficulties that had been created by the Government ofIndia/
India owing to their handling ,cf the Gandhi affair,     Ke had obtained the authority&quot; of the Cabinet to authorise theViceroy to arrest Gandhi and break up his organisation; andhad telegraphed the Viceroy in that sense *     The Viceroy had replied to the effect that his telegram appeared to expressdoubt as. to,his. (the Viceroyts) realisation of his reepon-sibilitioa in- regard to Gandhi, &quot;and- resenting that imputation^The Viceroy stated that he had given orders to the Gqvsrnor ..of Bombay to -aVrest Gandhi and prosecute him for hfs lastmanifesto to the Government of India.,     That was a week ago.On &quot;Saturday last he had sent a telegram to the Viceroy express-ing surprise that,he had received no farther information-as tothe arrest of Gandhi,     The Viceroy replied on Sunday that theGovernor of Bombay was reluctant to prosecute Gandhi on thegrounds Of -his manifesto but preferred to prosecute him 0&apos;naccount of the series of speeches that he had recently dellv-ered.     The Viceroy had agreed to that procedure-.     Anothertelegram had been received from the Viceroy quoting . a. manifestofrom&apos;-Gandhi, in which abominable charges were made against theGovernment.on account of -its treatment of prisoners,     Therewas a further telegram In which it was Stated that Gandhi        ;undentoo.lt to abandon his campaign of civil disobedience,, andwas adopting a more amenable.attitude,-    The Governor of bombay, had. announced that Gandhi would be arrested to-day&apos;(Monday) on account of-his speeches;, but the yiceroy had requested him to postpone the arrest till to-morrow, on accountof tho arrival of the Prince of Wales at -DeTlhi to-day,     -ThoViceroy&apos;.-had&apos; stated that he might make an announcement to that effect, in the -House of..&apos;Commons,     He wlshod to say in the&quot;House to-morrow&quot;that&apos;the&apos;abandonment by Gandhi of his campaign of civil disobedience did riot -exempt him from arrest.   . He-proposed to . say -In &apos;the House - that His Ma&apos;Ies-.ty.! s Government had&apos; - &apos;    &apos; &quot;   &apos;--&apos;- ----- -long/--3-  &apos;   &apos; &apos; -&apos;. --
long held the view that the arrest, cf Gandhi was necessary.They &quot;had, however, left it to the Viceroy&apos;to decide on the a- -date of &quot;his arrest.     He considered the choice of date was an&apos;&apos;unfortunate one-,, as it. would naturally be stated, that the arrest&apos;had been made: now&apos;, in order to avoid a difficult situation&apos;in Parliament. ;THE SECRETARY&quot;- OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS&quot; suggestedthat Mr. . Montagu&quot; should state, in his speech that a a far back-as&quot; October last His&apos; Majestyrs Government had &apos;explicitlyauthorised- the Viceroy to arrest Gandhi *-&quot;&quot; .  THE LORD PRIVY&quot; SEAL&quot; suggested that he&quot; might say thatafter a. careful review of the situation His Majesty-s Govern-.-ent-had.told the Viceroy In advance, in a formal ct-^rau^i&amp;a&quot;-tion, that.he: would have, their support if&apos; and when he as-restedGandhi. .,&quot; /-..&apos;  -; ...&quot;&apos; THE SECRETARY OP - STATE FOR INDIA stated that he ...desired to continue his speech in. the sense of the statement the Prime &apos;Minister-&apos;had made to Sir Claud Jacob at the meetingof the Indian&apos;Military Requirements Committee on February 10th,namely, that it was the fixed and irrevocable decision-of HisMajesty&apos;s Government to-maintain British rule in India,, and&apos; -&apos;that if there was--an attempt to challenge our position in-India the&quot; whole, strength of Brit.-in would be put-forward tomeet it t     He would . go. on to say. that. India-was&apos;-&apos;not one country,that it was not certain th&amp;t&quot;democratic&apos;Institutions were -applicable, to Indian conditions., and that Indian genius &quot;mustwork.-out the system; of self-government best: suited to&apos;India,He -also desired to-give; a, stern; and Solemn - warning - to- the indians and to remind&quot;them, that/when we -made--the pronouncementof August, 1917, and-the Government of India Act was passed,we were proceeding upon a definite plan and that - we&apos;should not&apos; be/
be coerced into departing from it.      He proposed to add that the analogy of the Irish Conference was wholly wrongand ridiculous i      India ha-3 never been promised self-government, and the Government of India Act and Its Pre-amble stated that further steps in the direction of self-government would be taken only when Parliament was- convincedthat the Indians had shown, by their good conduct,  that they knew how to make use of the Constitution that had beengranted them.      By &quot;good conduct&quot; ho meant more than good,conduct of Ministers and good speeches by Members:    the constituencies,  too, must shorc capacity for self-government,which included loyalty to the British Empire.      He also proposed to refer to the disrespect shown to the Prince of wales during his visit.THE PRIME MIHISTEP? suggested that it was notexpedient to make any statement which might be construed asan admission that His Royal Highness.&apos;s visit had been a failure,      He was inclined the other way.THE LORD CHANCELLOR suggested that reference mightbe made to the attempts by disaffected persons to mar thesuccess of the T&apos;rinoo! s visit.THE SECRETAR!&quot; OF STATE FOR ISDIA said that he proposed to continue that tho Government!s proclamation had promised p&apos;wo raj -Ithin the Empire,  and that tendencies of aseparatist character and insults to other parts of the Empirewould inevitably result in the postponement of further steps.Ho also proposed to say that loyalty to the King-Emperor wasa vital.condition of further progress.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL deprecated the introduction ofa reference to Ireland,      There was no doubt that the casesof Ireland and India.were entirely different,.but he con-sidered that it would be dangerous to develop that idea inview/
view of the forthcoming Debate on Friday next.This viev/ was generally concurred in.THE SEQftBTAKS  OF STATE FOR INDIA pointed out thatgreat difficulty was caused by the attitude of the LabourParty in regard to,India.      They were completely ignorantof India and lost no opportunity of. expressing sympathy withthe. most, outrageous demands of the extremists, and so caused,a false impression as to opinion in this country *At the request of the Prime Minister, Mr. Montaguread an extract from his speech declaring the policy of ElsMajesty&apos;s Government.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that Mr.  Montagu ahoulay emphasis on the fact that any measure of self-governnentgranted to India must be under the supreme and unalterableauthority of the King-Emperor*The Conference generally approved ofMr, Montagu :s statement of the generalpolicy of His Majesty&apos;s Government inindi a cTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA informed the Confence, with, reference to a decision of the Conference held onFebruary, 9, 1922, that he and the secretary of State for-Foreign. Affairs had agreed upon the draft of a telegram tobe despatched to the Viceroy..(3)    THE SECRETARY  OF STATE FOR INDIA stated that therewas  another point in his speech whioh might give rise tocontroversy,      He felt that ho was bound to give the Housecf Commons a full statement of all tho causes of Indianunrest.      Thef-e was no doubt that one cause of dissarisfactiwas uncertainty as to - the treatment of Indians in. the crown colonies,,     He asxed for authority to say,  in.tentativelanguage, that that question was now under consideration bythe Cabinet..THE SECRETARY/    &apos;
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TEE COLONIES stated thatIf anything was said that in any way modified the announce-ment he, had made, in regard to British East Africa, he mustash for leave to Intervene.      The demands of Indians asregards their treatment in East Africa were unreasonable,and if they were conceded they would throw the whole of. British East Africa into confusion.     We had no force thereto coerce the whits population, who felt strongly cn thisquestion,   and any repudiation of the statement he had mademight lead to them ejecting the Indians from East Africa,The Indian population of East Africa mainly consisted oflabourers, about 20,-COO in number, who had been brought to east Africa for the  construction of the Uganda Railway,They had been offered, and had declined, special represent-ation in the Council.    They claimed that they must be treatedas ordinary voters.      This was quite impossible in Africa,,If not carefully handled the question might lead to a rebellioj:It was a formidable issue, and he thought it would be wiser to leave it alone.      If this matter was referred to, hesuggested that Mr. Montagues statement should not be -limitedto the Crown Colonies, which were not mentioned at theImperial Meetings last year.     He suggested, the expression&quot;other parts of the Empire&quot; might be used.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA replied that itwas impossible to refer to the Dominions, as he had agreedthat the Indian claims for equal treatment in the Dominionscould not be granted.     All that he desired to be allowed tosay was that a Cabinet decision on this question was awaited.It was agreed---The tho Secretary of State for india should say that the matter was underthe consideration of the Cabinet.Whitehall Gardens, S.W,1.ISth February, 1922,.

1. With reference to H.A.C. 72, Conclusion 2, the Committeehad under consideration a Memorandum by the President of theBoard of Trade (CP. 3491) covering the draft of a Bill to amend the Merchandise Marks Acts, 1887 to 1911, together with an earlier memorandum by his predecessor (CP. 2491) in which the objects of the Bill were set out. It appeared from the latter memorandum that a Committee appointed in 1919 had made unanimous recom-mendations on the extension or amendment of the MerchandiseMarks Act in respect of the provisions relating to indications of origin of imported goods. The existing Act, although providing ina certain limited class of cases that goods on importation into theUnited Kingdom should bear an indication of origin, did not enfo2-cethis requirement generally. The Committee had proposed that theBoard of Trade should have power, after enquiry, to make an Orderrequiring such an indication where they were satisfied that that wasin the public interest.Provision was accordingly made in the Bill to give effect -to thisrecommendation, and also to authorise the making of Ordersprohibiting the use of particular British emblems on imported goodsor their wrappers without some sufficient indication of their foreignorigin. It was also proposed to give any person aggrieved, as thealternative to criminal proceedings before a Court of summary jurisdiction, the right to recover civil damages or to apply for an injunction. The Bill contained various provisions relating to falsetrade descriptions.The President of the Board of Trade, in a later Memorandum(CP. 3491) covering a revised draft of the Bill; explained that onthe advice of Parliamentary Counsel provisions relating to Govern -ment Marks had been included in the present Bill, which nowcontained the substance of the provisions relating to GovernmentMarks which had been in the original Government Marks Bill(CP. 1678). It had originally been contemplated at the Meeting ofthe Home Affairs Committee in August 1920 (H.A.C. 72), that thePrevention of Frauds (Government Contracts) Bill should also beincluded, but it had now been decided to omit this, as being outsidethe scope of Merchandise Marks Law. Provisions had also been added at the suggestion of the Home Office with a view to tighteningup existing legislation relating to the unauthorised use of the Royalarms, devices and titles.The President of the Board of Trade made the suggestion, withwhich the Committee agreed, that Clause 1.(1) was drafted too wide,in that it would be impossible for the Board of Trade to determinewhen it was in the public interest that an indication of origin shouldbe given in the case of any class of imported goods. He suggestedthat the clause should be so drafted as to limit the powers of theBoard to cases in which they were satisfied that the public might bedeceived as to the origin of goods.The Committee agreed That Clause I (I) should be redrafted in this sense.The President of the Board of Trade proposed that the last twolines of Clause 1 (2), viz., that the Board of Trade, in making anorder, should have regard to whether the goods are manufactured,produced or sold under conditions which constitvrted unfair tradecompetition, should be omitted on the ground that such a provision would be very difficult to administer.The Chairman enquired whether the period of one month fixed in Clause 1 (3) (b) as the minimum, time which must elapse betweenthe publication of the notice of intention to make an Order and themaking of the Order was long enough, having regard to the fact that most of the frauds contemplated would be committed in foreigncountries.The President of the Board of Trade undertook to look into thepoint.
, The President of the Board of Trade farther added that Part II,relating to Government marks, had been prepared in consultationwith the War Office and the Admiralty.The Bill had been submitted to and approved by the AdvisoryCouncil of the Board of Trade, and, if leave were given to introduce the Bill, he would consult the Chambers of Commerce beforeactually introducing it.The Minister of Agriculture drew attention to the case of chinese egg-powder imported in casks which was repacked in thiscountry in cardboard boxes for retail purposes. Unless power weregiven to eater premises it would be impossible for the Board ofTrade to enforce an order in respect of this class of goods. Hesuggested that the Board should have power to enter premiseswhere the repacking took place.It was agreed That the Minister of Agriculture should submit a statement onthe matter to the Board of Trade.The President of the Board of Trade undertook to investigate the point, and stated that if it was found to be so closely connectedwith the Bill that provision ought to be made, he would endeavourto have a clause drafted to meet the point.The Committee agreed To approve the draft Bill as amended, and to authorise thePresident of the Board of Trade to introduce it into theHouse of Commons.2. With reference to H.A.C. 103, Conclusion 1, the Committeehad under consideration a Memorandum by the Minister of Healthrelating to the position of the Poplar Board of Guardians (C. P. 3694),and a draft Bill (CP. 3728) to make provision for the exercise and performance of powers and duties of Boards of Guardians in thecase of their default. It was provided by Clause i of the&apos;Bill that where the Minister of Health was satisfied -that any Board of guardians had refused or failed to perform all or any of the duties imposed upon it by law, he might by Order dissolve the Board andappoint such person or persons as he thought fit to perform thepowers and duties of -the Board, and the Order might make such other provision as might be necessary.The Minister of Health said that it might not be necessary tointroduce the Bill at all, but he would like authority to do so, andhe would not use that authority if it could be avoided.The Committee were of opinion that the Bill was well adapted for the purpose for which it was intended.The Committee agreed To authorise the Minister of Health to introduce in the Houseof Commons the Bill relating to the exercise of the powersand duties of the Boards of Guardians in the case of theirdefault, on the understanding that he would avoid doing so, so far as reasonably possible.3. With reference to H.A.G. 85, Minute 2, the Committee had under consideration Memoranda (C. P. 3578 and CP. 3720) by theParliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport covering thedraft Electricity (Supply) Bill.The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transportreminded the Committee that in March 1921, when the subject was last under consideration, the Committee had expressed the view thatit was desirable that the Bill should be passed that Session. InOctober 1921 the Unemployment Committee (C.U. 39th, Concl. (1))
had advised the Committee that, in their opinion, the passageof the Bill would lead to the provision of more employment. In theabsence of the powers conferred by the Bill many large and important schemes, approved by the Electricity Commissioners,were being held up with consequential effects on unemployment.The Bill had been somewhat amended since it had beenapproved by the Committee, the most notable alterations being the omission of Clause 8 of the former Bill (which enabled a joint electricity Authority, under certain conditions, to invade theterritory of an existing authorised undertaker) and the insertion of provisions (Clause 14 and Schedule,, Part I) permitting of alterations in the methods of charging for electrical energy as prescribed by&quot; The Electric Lighting (Clauses) Act, 1899.&quot;The Committee approved the various amendments and altera-tions which had been incorporated in the Bill subject tothe amendment of Clause 14 (1) so as to provide for the simple repeal of sub-section (2) of Section 31 of theSchedule to &quot; The Electric Lighting (Clauses) Act, 1899,&quot;without the substitution of any provision in its place, andthe consequential deletion of Part 1 of the Schedule to this bill.The Committee agreed That arrangements should be made forthwith for the introduc-tion of the Electricity (Supply) Bill as approved in theHouse of Lords. *Coroners&apos;(EmergencyProvisionsContinuance) Bill.4. The Committee had under consideration a Memorandum bythe Home Secretary covering the draft of the Coroners&apos; (emergency provisions Continuance) Bill.The Committee agreed To authorise the Home Secretary to arrange for the immediate introduction of the Bill in Parliament.Bill to Amend &quot;TheWhale Fisheries(Scotland) Act,1907.&quot; &quot;5. The Committee had under consideration a Memorandum(CP. 3695) by the Secretary for Scotland covering the draft of aBill to amend1&quot; The Whale Fisheries (Scotland) Act, 1907.&quot;The Committee were informed that the object of the Bill wasto enable the Secretary for Scotland, without compensation, ocancel or suspend existing licences under the principal Act if itis proved to his satisfaction that whaling operations are prejudicial to the herring fisheries. A Committee which had examined thequestion of the decline of the herring fishery and the developmentof the whaling industry, while not satisfied that the two events wererelated as cause and effect, had reported that there w-as a very strong and general belief that the two events were so related, andthat the existence of this belief was having a prejudicial effect onthe local fishing industry. Attempts to effect an amicable settlementhad failed.The Committee agreedThat, subject to the concurrence of the Government Whipsbeing obtained, the Secretary for Scotland should beauthorised to introduce the Bill in the form, of the draft annexed to (C.P. 3695).2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,February 14, 1922.
