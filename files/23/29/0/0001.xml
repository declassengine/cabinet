The Lcrd Privy Seal informed the Cabinet that hehad received a telegram (appendix )      from the PrimeMinister containing draft Articles for a guarantee to france  in the event of unprovoked aggression by germany which it was proposed that he and Lord Curzon shouldhand to Me Briand this afternoon..The  rime Minister asked the Cabinet for their observations upon the Draft Articles;The Cabinet were aware that shortly beforeMe Bid and:s visit the French Ambassador had approachedLord Our2on on the subject of an offensive and defensivealliance with France^ and that M0 Briand had spoken to the Prime Minister and Lord Curzon on the subjectduring his recent visit to London..The Cabinet considered the aide-memoire on theproposed Anglo-French Alliance sent by the Prime Ministerto M* Briand on the 4th January, 1922 (AoJ-.311) andMc Briand:s reply thereto dated 8th January? 1922(AcJB319)eThe view was expressed that we were under moralobligations to defend the soil of France againstunprovoked aggression by Germany,,     The dominion prime Ministers at the imperial meetings last summerhad expressed their readiness to help France in suchan eventual!tycGeneral concurrence was expressed in the draftArticles proposed by the Prime Minister.     while they did not throw heavy obligations upon us, they wouldbe of great value to France,     It was pointed out thatan Anglo-French alliance of a bi-lateral character was open to serious objections as It would leave us no longerfreeu     France would endeavour to induce us to Increase
cur Array so that we should he ahle to send largemilitary forces to the Continent or wherever theywere required by Prance,   Under the proposed guarantee on the other hand vie should not have tomake any special military preparations.     our military policy would remain uneffected; and weshould only provide the military forces requiredfor the needs of the British Empirec     If Germanyattacked Prance, the whole of the resources of theBritish Empire would be available to support PranceoSuch a guarantee would give confidence in france and  would help the thoughtful section of Frenchopinion to fight the Chauenlst parly in Prance.Such a guarantee would also give us a freehand with regard to Germany.     It must be rememberedthat to many people in this country the idea of giving any assistance to Germany was repellentj   but we mustrealise that Germany is to us the most importantcountry in Europe not only on account of our tradewith her, but also because she is the key to thesituation in Russia,.     By helping Germany we mightunder existing conditions eyp ose ourselves to thecharge of deserting France;   but if Prance was our allyno such charge could be madecIt was stated that Germany would welcome sucha guarantee *     It ;vould make for a general easementin Europe.     It would not meet all the military dangers;but it was recognised that it was beyond our resources to deal with certain military problems such as thedefence of Poland,,-2- /It
