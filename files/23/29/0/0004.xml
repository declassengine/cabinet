(1)   T&apos;.&apos;it / ? reference-nc-e- to- a ^Con^fer-erace of Miajgterg heldon the 24th January, 1922, the Cabinet had unuerconsideration a^i^eLegxamwT^H^ved from Lord AXlenby,l&apos;.0t 31 of the 25th January (paper :.o. C.P. 3659)This telegram urged the desirability of immediate andconciliatciy action, and stated that unless the con-eessiorshe had advocated were meaw generously and   &apos;boldly, Lord Allenby saw no chance of retaining theco-operation of those rvho appreciate the truesituation.   The- telegram added that if Lord Allenby * advice were rejected he could- ndrhonourably&quot; remain,,and he therefore begged that his resignation mr.?htbe tendered to His luajesty.THE SBCRT.TAHY OP ST ATT- FOR PORSIGH AJTA1RSstated that the situation had been complicated by afurther development.   He had just been informed that ifLord Allenby resigned he would be followed by four ofhis British Advisers.   Mr. Amos had telegraphed Kr.Murray at the foreign Office of their intention, inorder that he mi^ht be informed of it in advance.Their threatened resignation showed that they had very strong feelings on the subject as it Would involvetheir giving up their careers.   It was for the Cabinetto consider whether they should attempt to carry out their policy with the whole of our instruments inEgypt gone.   If the High Commissioner and his fourprincipal advisers resigned, complete dislocation ofthe Government would ensue.   Aa the Cabinet f-.ere aware,he desired to follow Lord AllenbyTs advice.&apos; .three days ago he had endeavoured to build a bridge to meetthe wishes of- the Cabinet.   He asked to be allowed tothink the matter over and give the Cabinet his viewsof the new situation the following day.It/
Xt was suggested that the unanimity of opinion in the Foreign Office and among the Egyptian advisersof Lord AiXenbjr-raith which tho Cabinet was confronted,arose from tho -atmosphere of discouragement -which had been created by tho publication.-$f Lord Milner&apos;sReport and from the course of -events-in-Egypt during thepast year.Xt was suggested that the Cabinet should not be turned from its carefully considered policy by the .pressure of our agents in Egypt.   She whole british position was at stake; and it would be impossible todefend in Parliament the abandonment of the Protectorateyielding to force majeure.   Shere seemed to be little prospect of the Government*s policy being effectivelycarried out &quot;11th the present High Commissioner and his advisers.   Lord Allenby should be asked to return toEngland to report to the Government on the position.   Onhis arrival in England, the question of accepting his resignation could be considered.   In the meantime the advisers in Egypt should be requested to remain at theirposts until relieveda and carry on the government ofthe country,   pressure should be brought to bear upon these officials to induce them to remain at theirposts until a new High Commissioner was in the saddle*It was pointed out, on the other hand, that theEgyptian advisers were not the servants of His Majesty9sGovernment but the servants of the Egyptian Government.If they resigned they could not be compelled to remain at their posts.   It was clear that the position of theEnglish advisers had become more and more difficult inrecent years and it was necessary to make some con-cessions to the Egyptian, national sentiment to enablethe advisers to retain their influence with the EgyptianGovernmentm   2   -
Government.It was generally agreed that as   Lord Allenby(&quot;&apos;&quot; had stated that his opinions are well known in Egypt,it would be inexpedient for him to present theGovernments proposals to the Sultan.     A telegram should therefore at once be sent to him telling himnot to reveal the government&apos;s last telegram to him       1before he comes home.The Cabinet agreed --(1) That the Secretary of rotate for Foreign affairs should send a telegram to Lord Allenby statingthat his telegram had caused tho Cabinet grave concern, and requesting him to come home and report upon the situation and not to take any action &quot;in regard to the proposed letter to the Sultanuntil he had received further instructions.(2) That a Cabinet Meeting should be held at12*50 p,m. on the 27th January to considerthe Egyptian situation.AUSTRIA.      (2)       THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER stated that Austriahad asked for an immediate advance of two and a half millionpounds.     The situation in Austria was now deplorable.In a month&apos;s time America would probably release its lienupon the Austrian assets which would enable Austria toobtain further loans.     The money was immediately requiredto feed the population.     Food would be bought in hungary and Czecho-Slovakia.     If Austria did not obtain the 2-1millions asked for she would probably collapse, and the collapse of Austria would have disastrous eonsequenoes in eastern Europe.     czecho Slovakia was now prepared to give &apos;Some assistance.THE PRIME MINISTER stated that Pr. Benes, the Czecho-Slovakian Minister for Foreign Affairs was anxious to come over to England to discuss the situation, and he thoughtit desirable that he should come.      A request was sent tehim today and it Is possible that he might be here in a fewdays&apos; time.
? The question was raised as to whether we shouldsuffer more if Austria was allowed to collapse*     It was generally agreed that it vrould be necessary to getAustria on her feet before the Industries of eastern europe could be restarted.     Vienna was the banking centreCf the Near East.     The collapse of Austria meant   starvationamongst the people, and anarchy and looting.     The movement for a union with Germany would receive a strong impetus,and the neighbouring States would probably go to war overthe corpse of Austria.     The political consequences of a collapse were thus much more aerious than the financialconsequences,It was suggested that any advance approved should bemade through the Anglo-Austrian Bank end net through theAustrian Government.The Cabinet agreed -That the arrival of Dr. Benes should beawaited before a decision is arrived at,and that in the meantime, the Bank of england should be informed of tho action contemplatedand of the reasons for delaying the decision.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,27th January. 1922.
