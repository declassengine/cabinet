DISBARMENT   (1) Tin S^CR^TARY 0? STATS FOR WAR enquired if heRegiments.     He had already stopped recmiting forthem, and had made arrangements as regards theNorthern Irish Regiments which were satisfactory toSir James Craig *&quot;the Cabinet agree the SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS reminded theCabinet that when Lord Allenby first submitted his resignation they had proposed inviting him to comehome to explain his views.     Now that he had renewedhis application to resign he (Lord (hirzon) considered it necessary that the Government before accepting his resignation should invite him to come home and reportto them as to the position in Egypt,     The form in whichthe message/Should be conveyed to Lord Allenby wasa matter that required consideration.     First of all itwas necessary to make it clear to Lord Allenby and tothe Egyptian Ministers the nature of our latest offer.That offer was intended as a bridge!    and it wasimportantto establish that it was not a tactical move on the part of the Government, but Chat it involvedlarge concessions to Egyptian sentiment.     Secondly, Itwas necessary to make clear to Lord Allenby the Cabinet&apos;ssense of surprise and disappointment at the mannerin shlch they had been kept In the dark as to hisproceedings during the past six weeks, with the resultthat they were suddenly confronted with what amountedto an ultimatum,    : **his* lytf the Cabinet were of S CISTERNIRISHRIGFJRNTS.mi*ht announce the disbandment of the Southern IrishThat there was no objection to the disbandment of the Southern IrishRegiments being announced.EGYPT.(2)   With reference to Cabinet 4 (22), Conclusion 1,/entitled
entitled te say that they had not been supplied with adequate Information as regards the position in Egypt,without which it would be impossible for them to takeextreme action,,     The fact that Lord Allenby had declined to comply with the Cabinet&apos;s request to send homeSir Gilbert Clayton and Mr. Amos furnished a reason forasking Lord Allenby himself to come to England toenlighten the Cabinet as to the situation.     Fourthly,it was desirable that Lord allenby resignation shouldnot be accepted until after he had arrived in England.If his resignation were accepted now, excitement andapprehension would be caused both In England and inEgypt.     The British Sress was hostile to the Government^policy on the Egyptian question mainly because they didnot understand it..     When it became known that lord allenby had been summoned home it was probable thatthere would be an outburst in the Press at home, whileif his impending resignation now became known in Egyptthere was a possibility of a serious outbreak and renewedattempts at assassination.     In order to meet the Presscriticisms and the situation in Egypt it was desirable thata brief and emphatic statement of the position should beprepaid explaining the offer that had been made byH.M. Government and the circumstances in which lord allenby was coming home to discuss the situation.     Hethought that some such statement of the Government&apos;s policy should be published simultaneously in Egypt and at home.LORD CURZON then read a draft of a telegram whichhe proposed to send to Lord Allenby in the sense whichhe had indicated.     Subject to certain suggestions forverbal amendments, the draft telegram met with thecordial approval of the Cabinet.It was suggested that Lord Allenby had not made it clear to his advisees ii E^ypt the magnitude of the/concessions
concessions involved in the offer of H.M.. Government,and that he had failed to interpret the Cabinet&apos;s policy to the Egyptians just as he had failed to keep the cabinet informed of the situation in Egypt,It was suggested that a communication should besent to the British advisers in Egypt impressing upon them that His Majesty1s Government counted upon thorn todo their duty and to remain at their posts in order totide over the interval which must elapse before a finaldecision was taken and a new High Commissioner was installed.It should be explained to them in a personal telegram thata general resignation of the British advisers at the presentmoment would strike a serious blow at the interests of theBritish EmpireuIt was agreed that such a telegram had better besent unofficially by friends of the British advisers inthe Foreign Office.The point was raised as to whether it would be expedient to publish the details of the latest Britishoffer in a communique to the Press,,     If that offer be cameknown now, it would certainly not be accepted by the Egyptiansand the difficulties of the new High Commissioner would be greatly increased if, on his arrival, he were only able tooffer proposals which had already been discussed and rejected.It was agreed that the published statement should contain a general review of the situation and of the policy ofH.M. Government, without disclosing the details of thelatest offer made to the Egyptians,/it was also
It was also suggested that tho Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs might consent to see a smalldelegation of the Newspaper Proprietors Association,and should explain the position to them and impress upon them the gravity of the situation and the dangerof encouraging the Egyptians to make demands whichwere incompatible with the preservation of BritishImperial interestst     The generous concessions containedin the offer already made by H.M. Government shouldalso be emphasised.The Cabinet agreed :-(i).That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should telegraph to Lord Allenby in the sense ofthe draft telegram which he had read to the Cabinet,(ii)that a statement should be preparedexplaining the situation and thepolicy of H.M.&apos;s Government forsimultaneous publication in Egypt-and at home.NATIONAL (3)    The Cabinet agreedFINANCE.To have ageneral dis cuss Ion onthe National financial situation on an early date, and in any case before the Chancellor of theExchequer!s proposals for the1922/23 Budget had taken finalshape.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,27th January, 1922.
