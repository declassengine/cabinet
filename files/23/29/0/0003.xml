(2)     With reference to Cabinet 2 (22) S,the Cabinet had before then telegraphic correspondencewhich had been exchanged between the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs and Lord allenby (0.P.-3643).THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FCE El CM APF $CISreminded the Cabinet that at the last meeting ithad been decided that it was undesirable to reach a conclusion in regard to Egypt in the absence of theLord Privy Seal, and. that a desire had been expressedfor more information as to the exact state of Egypt.Ke had accordingly telegraphed to Lord Allenby on the18th Janxxary (see telegram No.21.H)*    He had circulatedto the Cabinet Lord Allenby&apos;s reply of the P,Oth January-(No.27).    In that telegram, Lord Allenby had explainedand defended his present action and had indulged in serious prognostications as to the situation which would arise In Egypt if his advice were not accepted.   In hissecond telegram of the 20th January, which -safr intendedto be personal to himself (Lord Curzon),he had threaten-ed to resign if his advice were not accepted.   Histhird telegram of the ^Oth January was also a personal telegram to himself in reply to one which he had sentin order to acquaint Lord Allenby of the views that hadbeen expressed by the members of the Cabinet when theEgyptian-question had been discussed on the 18th JanuaryIn his reply Lord Allenby had referred to the fact thatthe British forces were the sole effective guarantee of    air position In Egypt, but he regretted that lord allenby had not taken up his suggestion to expand his letter to the Sxxltan in such a way as to get over thedifficulties which had been foreseen by certain membersof the Cabinet,/lcfd chrzon
 LORD-CURZON stated that he had discussed the question with the Lord-Privy Seal, especially in regard to the parliamentary difficulties to be overcome. The main difficulty was that in Lord Allenby&apos;s proposals we were asked to make concessions which we could not retrieve. Lord Allenby proposed to abolish the Protectorate in the hope that the Egyptian Government would at a later date discuss the reserved points in the spirit in which we desired, and would make a treaty on that basis. The undertakings given to Lord Allenby by Adly and others were purely personal and in no way committed the Egyptian Governments. He thought it would not be unreasonable to ask the Egyptian Ministers for much more specific undertakings as regards the reserved subjects. He had drafted a telegram to send to Lord Allenby with that object. Parliament would no doubt take the view that the assurances given by the Egyptian Ministers were not sufficient to justify the abolition of the Protectorate before the treaty was signed. He suggested that that difficulty might be got over in the following way. The agreement might eventually take the form of a treaty which would go before the British Parliament and the Parliament in Egypt, but he proposed that the consent of the British Parliament should be obtained by Resolution in advance to the abolition of the Protectorate on condition that a satisfactory agreement was arrived at with regard to the reserved points. His telegram to Lord Allenby had been drafted in a conciliatory manner and with the object of not offending the susceptibilities of the Egyptian ministers. It also explained the parliamentary difficulty which/confronted
conf^ntedTHIsTtfa^^s^^ -which itappeared that Lord Allenby had no knowledge *     he proposed that they should also ask the egyptian government to make a formal statement giving the assurances which involved byv implication in lord 411enby&apos;s telegram, and which he believedthey might not be unwilling to give.       In themeantime, before the Treaty was concluded, he proposedthat martial law should he abolished, that theEgyptian Government should be encouraged to set up a parliament, that the Egyptian Foreign^Office shouldhe re-established, and finally that during the interval which must elapse before the Protectoratewas formally abolished, the country should practicallyrevert to the status, quo before the war,  except Vhatthe Turkish Suzerainty wo\xld no longer exists     Weshould thus maintain our juridical rights and thegovernment of the country would be carried on by an egyptian Ministry and an Egyptian Foreign Office very   -much as in Lord Grower&apos;s tirae0     He was not verysanguine as to whether these proposals would be acceptedbut from a parliamentary point of view they would notbe seriously open to attack, as they would show asincere attempt to arrive at a settlement without making an unconditional surrender cIt was suggested that the difficulty in the case oEgyptians was the same as that experienced by alldelegates of extreme movementsc     They did not dareto sign a document which might be regarded astreasonable by their supporters.    The articulate partyin Egypt was&apos; an educated minority with extreme views jand no moderate Egyptian could sign a document whichcould satisfy them*/The question
The question was.-o?ai.sed as to whether an instrument in the form of a 1^eai;y&quot;waB^absC*iutelynecessary, and it was suggested that a unilateral declaration or an instrument in the form of a par-liamentary resolution setting forth our vie?/ of ourrelations with Egypt night suffice,     Eo immediate steps could be taken to draw up a treaty,     The firstthing to be done was to draw up a Constitution for egypt.     If a treaty was agreed to between the Britishand Egyptian Governments it would have to be submittedto the Parliaments of Britain and Egypt *     Up to now we had favoured a treaty as the Egyptians attach greatimportance to concluding a treaty on equal terms witha great Power.     It was also very important that any arrangements made as regards the reserved points shouldbe embodied in a formal document signed by both parties c,LORD CURZON read the draft of a telegram vdrich he proposed to send to Lord Allenby*The view was strongly expressed that the cruxof the question tvas that our juridicial position in egypt should not be altered until we obtained a satisfactory agreement as regards tho reserved points.     It was truethat the troops wore our greatest security, but our useof the Army could be more easily justified morallyif our Protectorate rights were still in beings ,The view was generally sharded that the telegramdrafted by the Secretary of state for Foreign affairs would secure our position and offered the best chanceof extricating the Government from the difficult positioninto which it had been forced./The Cabinet agreed
 The Cabinet agreed:-

 The Prime Minister,

 The Lord Privy Seal,

 The Chancellor of the Exchequer,

 The Lord Chancellor,

 The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,

 The Secretary of State for the Colonies

 The President of the Board of Education should meet to-morrown the 24th January at 3.0 p.m. to consider the draft telegram to Lord Allenby (C.P. 3647) and the position created by Lord Allenby&apos;s throat to resign.

? IRISH ?.

 (3) With reference to Cabinet 89 (21) Conclusion 1 the Cabinet were informed that the Conference betweon Sir James Craig and Mr. Collins which had resulted in the published agreement (C.P. 3644) was in all respects ? satisfactory and that great hopes were entertained that it would lead to closer relations between the Free State and Ulster Governments.

? OF THE TREATY AND APPROVAL OF THE CONSTITUTION.

 (4) The Secretary of State for the Colonies further informed the Cabinet that the recent meetings with Irish Ministers had covered much ground and the results had been embodied in Heads of Working Arrangements (C.P. 3648) for implementing the Treaty. It was clear that the Irish Ministers wished, if possible, to avoid the necessity for the setting up of an Irish Provisional Government and a Parliament for Southern Ireland by Act of the Imperial Parliament and would like to obtain a Free State Government and an approved Constitution within the shortest possible time, and that an Irish Parliament should be elected as soon as the fresh registers could be prepared.
It was&apos;worthy o ^^ withoutinfringing the Treaty it was possible to ratify theTreaty and approve the Constitution of the Free state by means of a One Clause Bill,     There were great advantages from the point of view of the Irish ministers in getting their draft Constitution approved by the parliament for Southern Ireland not only because thefollowers of Mr* de Valera abstained from attendingthat Body but because they could then contend that their constitution derived its authority from the Treaty andnot from a British &amp;ct of ParliamentsThe Cs einot agreed :^To refer the questions whether withoutbreach of the Treaty the Free StateGovernment could be set up by meansof a One Clause Bill;, ratifying theTreaty and the Free State constitution to the following Committee:-The Attorney-General (In the Chair)*Sir Hamar Greenwood.Sir Fo Llddell.Sir Fo GreereMre L, Curtis (Secretary)^The Lord Chancellor agreed to assist the committee with advice.5*     In the event cf  the Free State Government being established In (say) 3 months&apos; time it would be necessaryto finance the Irish Government In the meantime and It was proposed to ask the House of Commons for  500,000 for thepurpose of carrying the Provisional Government on to 31stMarohj 1922, and if necessary take a vote on account for irish services for the period from 1st April to the dateof the establishment of the Free State government     It wavery desirable that the &quot;intercepted grants&apos;&quot;&apos; should be re-couped as that the Irish Local Authorities oould tuidavtako
various schemes In relief of unemployment, etciDispensationinjuries.The Cabinet agreedTo approve the proposal that somuch of the intercepted grantsas had already been applied shouldbe recouped to the Irish Governmenton the distinct understanding thatthe amount in question should beregarded as a payment on accountof the British Governments shareof the compensation payment.6,     The Cabinet were informed of the arrangements in contemplation for the assessment of compensationfor injuries sustained in the recent conflict.     Thegeneral view was favourable to an offer being madeto the Ifcish Ministers that the British Government,should bear half the total losses j such an offer would lead to a limit being placed on the number and amount of the claims,     It was also urged thatInducements should be given to claimants to settlequickly.     Reference was also made to a claim bySir J. Craig that the British Government should bear the whole cost of compensation in the case ofUlster on the ground that all the damage in Ulsterhad been inflicted by the Sinn Fein party.     Therewas general concurrence with the view that Ulster-should not receive in this matter less favourable terms than were granted to the rest of Ireland.(In this connection a letter was read to the Cabinet from Sir James Craig,and a draft reply prepared by theLord Privy Seal)7.Reference was then made to the desirability ofMKESTY:iAPORTATIONP ARMS AND    making the amnesty ea wide as possible, to the wishBlSH UNIVSR-HIES. of the Irish Ministers that for the present therestrictions on the export of arms etc. from GreatBritain to Ireland should be maintained and to the/expressed
expressed intention of those Ministers to continue thegrant of financial assistance to the Irish universities and in particular to make no differentiation in thisrespect as regards Trinity College^ Dublin.irish[representa.jtiok atmjenoa 98.     In the course Of the general discussionemphasis was laid on the desirability of impressingon the Irish Ministers the necessity for maintainingorder in Ireland and of observing the spirit as wellas the letter of the Treaty in such matters as thestatus of the Representative of the Crown.     Cautionshould be observed as regards the money paid to theProvisional Government and care should be taken toretain a substantial amount In hand.     Steps shouldalso bo taken te secure that the Draft Constitutionwas fully In acaord with the letter and spirit of theTreaty.     If an agreedBill and Constitution was in draftby 8th March, no technical objection need be raised tothe attendance of Proa State Representatives at the genoa Conference.The Cabinet agreed generally with, the views expressed above.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.January 24th, 1922*
