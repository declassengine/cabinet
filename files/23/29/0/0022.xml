CANADIAN CATTLE EMBARGO.

(l) With reference to Cabinet 6 (22), Conclusion 11, the Cabinet had before them the following documents  in regard to the Canadian Cattle Embargo:-

Memoranda by the Secretary of State for the Colonies (Papers C.P.-3844 and C.P.-3863):

A Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries (Paper C.P.-3900).

The Lord Privy Seal recalled that, as the result of the last investigation of this question by the Cabinet, the Minister of Agriculture had announced in Parliament that, in view of the almost unanimous opinion of agriculturists of all classes in England and Wales that the removal of the embargo would seriously injure the industry and the fact that the Royal Commission had reported that it would have little effect on the price of meat, the Government did not  propose to introduce legislation for the purpose of removing the embargo.

 The Secretary of State for the Colonies, who was unfortunately unable to be present at the Cabinet, had circulated a Memorandum setting forth the various pledges given to the Canadian Government, and pointing out that in his own case, relying on the pledges which bad been given and on the Report of the Royal Commission., be had declared himself in favour of the removal of the embargo.  Mr Churchill had therefore proposed that, in accordance with an answer given by the Prime Minister in Parliament on March 16, 11921, the responsibility for a decision should be left to the House of Commons and Ministers should have full liberty in regard to their votes.

The President of tho Board of Agriculture and Fisheries said that he had no Objection to the matter being left open, on the understanding that there would be no Government legislation and that any vote would be taken on a 

Private
M&amp;raber*s Bill or Private Motion.After referring to the at, at amenta trade by Lord Rrnleand Lord 1^ on.tt* subject of the Government * a pledges,and to the remark on page 11 of the Royal Commission&apos;sHeport, that &quot;What the farmers think ray be a reason forsome delay in taking action if Y*onr majesty Qovemtoentthinks that this is desirable&quot;, the Minister cf Agricultureurged that possibly the best solution won id bo to delaytakinj? action at the tro^entf end to act upon the Hewort, ifnecessary, at sore labor date.   At the sar-o time he emphasizedthe view that it was-most improbable that the opinion ofagricultural interests&apos; would alter, and. pointed out thatthe embargo had been approved by consecutive Governments inthe past and had recently been supported by &apos;*r RunolRarw   Ifthe Course suggested by the Secretary of State for theColonies was to be adopted, he nn.ist be quite free to voicethe views of agriculture in England and &quot;Tales, and to explain to the House of Commons the objections to the reKsOval of the embargo.The Secretary for &quot;Scotland remarked that if thislatitude was allowed to the glints tef of Agriculture, heleftist be at liberty to voice the views of Scottish agricul-turrets in the opposite sense.The First lord of the Admiralty reminded the Cabinetthat &apos; anv &apos;- Bill to remove the embargo would have no chance,of passing the House of lords. &apos;While recognising that . the course proposed might be adversely -criticised, the Cabinet, felt that in the specialcircumstances of the case there wan no alternative.The Cabinet accordingly agreed -*   -&quot; &apos;
Member&apos;s Bill or Private Motion.

 After referring to the statements made by Lord ?rnle and Lord Lee on the subject of the Government&apos;s pledges, and to the remark on page 11 of the Royal Commission&apos;s Report, that "What the farmers think may be a reason for some delay in taking action if Your Majesty&apos;s Government thinks that possibly the best solution would be to delay taking action at the moment, and to act upon the Report, if necessary, at some later date. At the same time he emphasized the view that it was most improbable that the opinion of agricultural interests would alter, and pointed out that the embargo had been approved by consecutive Governments in the past and had recently been supported by Mr Runciman. If the course suggested by the Secretary of State for the Colonies was to be adopted, he must be quite free to voice the views of agriculture in England and Wales, and to explain to the House of Commons the objections to the removal of the embargo.

 The Secretary for Scotland remarked that if this latitude was allowed to the Minister of Agriculture, he must be at liberty to voice the views of Scottish agriculturists in the opposite sense.

 The First Lord of the admiralty reminded the Cabinet that any Bill to remove the embargo would have no chance of passing the House of Lords.

 While recognising that the course proposed might be adversely criticised, the Cabinet felt that in the special circumstances of the case there was no alternative.

 The Cabinet accordingly agreed -


To adhere to their previous decision not to introduce Government legislation toremove the embargo;That,  in the event of a Debate in thehouse oi Commons taking place on a private member&apos;s Bill or Motion,  the responsibilityfor the decision should be left to theHouse oi Commons, and Ministers should have full liberty ox action in regard to theirvotes;That in tho event of such Debate takingplace,  the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries should be at liberty to state the views held by agriculturists in Englandand Wales and the reasons for such views,but should also indicate that a substantial body of agricultural opinion in -Scotland was in favour of the removal of the embargo;That the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries and the Secretary for scotland should confer with a view to the statement to be made by the former under ( c) abovebeing an agreod statement so far asScotland is concerned.
HOME-GROWN SUGAR.

With reference to War Cabinet 520, Conclusion 2, (3)/the Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries (Paper C.P.-3874) on the subject of Home-grown Sugar.

 The Minister of Agriculture informed the Cabinet that he desired, with the concurrence of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to remove the excise duty on home-produced sugar in the Finance Bill of this year, but pointed out that the demand of those interested was that no excise should in fact be charged for a period at least five years. The difficulty was, however, that no guarantee could be given on this latter point, in as much as it was impossible to bind future Governments or Parliament.

 The efforts made to grow sugar beet in this country had been most successful not only as regards the crop itself but as regards the beneficial effect upon the land. Experience showed that the success of German agriculture was largely due to the practice of growing sugar best crops periodically.

 The difficulty in this country was in extracting the sugar from the best. This could not be done at present successfully, largely owing to inexperience. The Kelham factory had made a disastrous start last year, and had only extracted 8 per cent, of sugar when the percentage should have been about 12. The view generally held was that it would be necessary for at any rate three or four years to protect this infant industry by remitting the duty.  The amount of duty at issue, Â£120,000, would not in fact be obtained this year,, for if the duty was not taken off the factories would close.

 The chancellor of the Fxchequer stated that he was satisfied that unless the excise was removed the factories would stop.  On the other hand, if the industry was built up, a good revenue might be anticipated in the future.
Another serious aspect was the effect on employment.   Ifthe factories closed, 5000employees woeId be thrown out ofwork, and farming would also suffer owing to the loss ofthe beneficial effects of the beet crop.   He agreed withthe proposal of the Minister cf Agriculture, and wished theCabinet to understand that in point of fact no tsoney wanbeing sacrificed.The Cabinet were reminded, that this question raised alarge and controversial issue in respect of protective duties on food, although no doubt in the least objection-able form,   fhe cuestion was whether it was advisable on political grounds to raise this issue at the present moment.On the other hand, the Cabinet, were Informed that the PrimeMinister was In favour of the ramie filer, of the excise ongtjgar beet, and had drawn attention to the analc^cns easeof tobacco grown In Irelandf which had been assisted by(loyernments of Free lirade complexion.flie Cabinet agreed*a) &quot;hat the excise duty on hon.e-prod.ucedSugar should be removed in the Finance* ,.3111 of 19fj2-*225.(b) &quot;&quot;hat the Mrister of Agriculture andFisheries, in consultation with theChancellor of ths 1^.xoT;ebuor, should arrange the date on which the actualamounoerent of this decision shouldbe published:(c) That in announcing the. Government&apos;sd^cisioj^f-he Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries should emphasise the very exceptional nature of the ease.
mtotsh (55) With reference&apos;to Cabinet 20 (22), Conclusion 11, theSecretary of state for War informed the Cabinet that bothSir James Craig and &quot;Mr Michael Collins, in the course of a discussion at the Irish Conference that morning, had ex-pressed the view that the Ulster month should run from thed&amp;fce of the Irish Pill becoming operative,   &quot;be question -bad been referred to the expert Svtb-Committee.   Sir james craig had also ashed, that the provisions relating to theCouncil Of Ireland should be repealed by the present Till.Wr Collins was not unfavourable to this proposal, butfeared possible reactions, Inasmuch aa an alteration ofthe Treaty was involved.   These two&apos;questions, on both ofwhich point would certainly be raised in the Debate on theBill in the House of Commons that afternoon, made it restdesirable that the Pill should, if possible, he postponed,&quot;&quot;he Cabinet agreed  (a) That arrangements should be made to postpone the Irish Bill until thefollowing day-*-(b) That the Secretary of State for theColonies should be requested to draft a form of statement to be made that.   .    afternoon by the Leader of the House.(The Secretary of State for War undertook to convey these Conclusions to the IrishCommittee.)TL^^U^^a^^ Ax0^^aj^^^A  t* v &apos; CTTWL&apos; UMAX.a^Ui- LoL.

(4) with reference to Cabinet 30 (28), Conclusion 3*the Cabinet bad under consideration the recent develop-mOnts in the dispute in the engineering and allied trades.%%6 Minister of Labour, after intlicating the earlyhistory, of the dispute, reminded, the Cabinet that early in :C4arch the allied trades !fead been&apos; approached by the -deploy ore *Federation on the subject of the point at iseua between theemployers and the Amalgamated Engineering Union, ballotshad been tak**n, and there was rorghly a majority of 4 to 1against the acceptance of the employers * terms.   The numbersvoting were only, about 20 per cent, of the total Membership.The employers had then announced their intention of postingnotices- to tho works en in the allied trades, and at thispoint Mr Henderson had attempted to mediate between theemployers and the urertesn,   After considerable discussion,Sir Allan Smith, rM Henderson and Mr Powerntan, had, on the24th &apos;!arch^ signed .a document which in effect providedthat,in the event of the. employees or ttieir representativeshelm unable,to agree with the management on a particular proposal, the management should be entitled to give a doci-slon which should be observed pending the recognised pro-esdur^ for dieecssion being sejem through.   This agreement,unfortunately, had been ^rejected by the negotiating &quot;-o^rlt-tee or the A.r.a,, which had always taker: the lire that questions in issue should he discussed and settled beforework was resumed, &quot;and on this occasion the Union had offered to discuss the terjvss of the agreement with the employers ifthe notices were withdrawn,   This proposal had been rejected by the employers, and in the result it seemed not unlikelythat in a week&apos;s time 9G0tCCG men would he unemployed as adirect consequence of t1-- lock-out.   1*1 these circumstances the question arose whether the Oovernment should bring intoforce the VacMnery of the Industrial Courts Act,, Part tl.
under whioh the minister of Labour could order an Enquiry,whether the parties, to the dispute favoured such a courseor not,   He (l)r, Sfoenamara) thought an*inquiry would benest beneficial and would probably result in a Reportfavourable. to the contention of the employers,   &quot;he latter would &apos; probably oppose an inquiry, but would, ne vert?&quot;solessgive evidence if one were held.   If, however, the Oovem-went did not hold an Enquiry, then their action would bemisrepresented in Labour circles and tho moderate elementswould be alienated,   He accordingly asked the Cabinet toauthorise him to use every further possible rnesrj s of settling the dispute, and,in the event of failure, to holdan Enquiry under the /ct and obtain a Report with 0.3 littlede1ay as posslble,&apos; The Cabinet was generally of the opinion that, it was desirable to hold, such an gnquiry with a view to bringing the present dispute -to an end, and accordingly agreed --That the Lord Privy Seal, the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the Minister ofLabour should have fit 11 discretion to setup a Court of inquiry if and when they thought It desirable,     In this connection the ri&amp;Lnisters in question should. Irwe due regard to the views expressed by theCabinet in favour of ouch an Enquiry,
(5) With reference to Cabinet SC f82), Conclusion 4, tha&quot;p Law am).- j^nRR COM-      lord privy Seal informed the Cabinet tbat^: in view, of thepresent -industrial situation, he bad requested the HomeSecretary to keep in close touch with-any developments *The Secretary of state for Home Affaire stated thata meeting of the Preservation of low and Order Committeebad been held that morning, and that there was some dangerof the lendon power-a tat iona being demobilised as the resultof the&apos; contemplated extension of the loch-out.   Portlierenquiries were bairns- made, and it was proposed to issue aserious warning to the employers to the effect that it mightbe necessary for the Government to take over the power-stations if the.look-out materialised in their ease.
fctftfRS&apos; (6)   This Cabinet were informed by the President of theBoard of T?dueation that the repra eentat ivee of the Teacherswere pressing for the appointment of a Select Corarltteo onthe question of teachers&apos; superannuation.   He, however,thought that, having regard tc the technical character ofthe subject, it would be beat to have a Committee on thelines of the Percentage Grantc Committee.The Cabinet agreed --That the President of the Board of Education,.after consultation with the Chancellor or&quot;the Exchequer, should - submit the proposedpersonnel, of the Oormittce on Teacher&apos;; *Superannuation to the Lord privy Seal.2.
