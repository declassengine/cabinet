tFEE CONFERENCE     (l) The Prime Minister raised the question whether it\T ECUXOG-NE .would not be useful to invite the Belgian Prime Minister toattend the meeting already arranged at Boulogne between M.-Folncare&apos; and himself.Against the proposal the following objections were raised;-   first, that the meeting had been widely advertisedin the Press as a personal meeting between the Prime Ministerand Ma Poincare, and a sudden proposal to invite a third party might arouse suspicion in France;    second, that italy would be very.sensitive at the introduction of a third Powerwhen she herself was unrepresented, although it was pointedout that at present no Ministry in Italy had been formed toreplace M. Bonomi&apos;s Government, which had been defeated in-the Chamber;    third, that there are real advantages in a personal discussion between the two Prime Ministers..On a review of these considerations the cabinet agreed  That it would be wiser for the Prime Ministerto meet M. Poincare&apos; alone.
(?) The Prime Minister aoramunic-ated to the Cabinet a message from the Italian Government, received&quot;through Dr.Giannini, the Italian liaison officer between the Seexeirarlat-General of the Genoa Conference and the British Secretariat,nreir.? that,while reparations should not be discussed indetail at f-snoa, it would be almost impossible to discussEuropean economic questirns without any reference to thesubject.There was general agreement that it would, in theevent, almost certainly prove impracticable at Genoa toavoid die cue sing the bearing of reparations o*n the economic position, but, in view of the strong objection taken bythe French Government and peoi.&quot;&apos;    at and since the Cannes.Conference to reparations being raised at G^noa, it was feltthat it -.?ould be advisable to leave events to take their course at Genoa without raising difficulties by trying to insist, now -on the question of reparations being discussedth en .

Report, Part II,v Expenditure,   .Chapiter 1, dealing with the Board of Education Estimates^the Lord Privy Seal reported the recommendations of theCabinet Committee, which provided for a reduction on the july Estimates of  5,900,000 for England and Hales, and a saving 3?or Scotland of about  800..000, making a reduction of 6,500,000 as against the proposal of the Geddes Committeefor a reduction of  18 .000,000,.      Mr0 Chamberlain pointedout that the divergence was mainly due to the decision of-the Cabinet that the salaries of teachers could not.be&apos; red\iced without breach of contract, and to the rejection .Of the proposal to exclude children under six- voars of age,owing to the opposition in the country,  (The figures as agreed between the Board of Education and the Treasury are set out in Appendix I).&apos;     With regard to expenditure oncentral administration, and particularly on the ;inspectorate;the Committee recommended a further reduction by the Boardof Education&apos; on their estimate of  843,000.      The Presidentof the Board of Education stated that he did hot. believe ...the saving to be possible but he was willing to review the/expenditure.The Cabinet adopted the. recommendations on educational expenditure of the CabinetCommittee.(b) Navy, Army With reference to Part I of the Interim Report ofand Air&apos; , ,... -Expenditure the Committee on National Expenditure, the Secretary of
State for the Colonies stated that at the request of the Prime Minister, he had been in communication with the Admiralty and Air Ministry with a view to securing further reductions in their respective Estimates. He had not dealt with the War Office, as the Secretary of State for War had, at the Finance Committee, undertaken to make a further reduction of £500,000, which would bring the cut on the Army Estimates to £13,000,000.

c) Air Estimates.

 The Air Ministry had agreed to sacrifice the provision of two Squadrons for home defence, and to reduce the factor of safety in flying machines to the war level. This would provide a saving of £495,000, and the Air Estimates would therefore stand at about £10,250,000, net, exclusive of Middle East and War Liabilities.

 The Cabinet gave its approval to this reduction.

d) NAVAL ESTIMATES.

 The Secretary of State for the Colonies stated that the result of his Conference with the Admiralty had resulted in the recommendation of the following gross reductions :-

 Dockyards ... £500,000.

 Capital Ships ... £?.

 Fuel ... £?.

 Total ... £1,300,000

The figure under "Capital Ships" was obtained by delaying work on capital ships for three months and thus throwing one quarterly payment into the succeeding financial year. Mr. Churchill stated that he was satisfied that in 1923-24 it should be possible to make further substantial economies in the Admiralty.

 The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to the desirability of the Board of Admiralty considering placing orders in advance over long periods, so as to enable the shipbuilding firms to organise their yards more efficiently and also to throw on the banks the responsibility of making advances.

 The Cabinet approved the proposals for a further gross reduction in the Naval Estimates of £l,300,000 which would bring the cut on the Navy Estimates to approximately £20,500,000.
GAIulI-SCltfS General agreement was expressed with the viewDf PALESTINE &quot; &apos;   .AMD COHSTANr. &apos;        that the cost of the white gendarmerie in.TINOPLE,Palestine should not ho an Imperial charge,and that every possible endeavour should bemade to secure a substantial saving on thocost of the garrison in Constantinople,

He statedthat it was hoped to secure from this group of services a saving of about  2.9 millions.Arising out cf the Report the Chancellor o the Exchequer stated that he wished to draw attentionto(a) The Ministry of Transport(b) The Department of Overseas Trade,(c) Forestry,(d) The Mines Department *No reductions were recommended by the geddes committee in reg&amp;rd to the Ministry of Transport, butthey proposed that the Minis try&apos;s functions should betransferred to the Board of Trade.The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that his committee were of opinion that it was not feasible to make the transfer at present and that no materialeconomy would be effected thereby.     What wasrec ommended was the early appointment of a CabinetCommittee to consider the allocation of the functionsof the Ministry of Transport.     In the view of theChancellor of the Exchequer there should bo a Ministryof Communications to which the duties now discharged by the Post Office and the Ministry of transport should be assigned.The Cabinet approved the recommendationsof the Cabinet Committee.The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that the geddes Committee recommended that this department should, cease as a separate Department and a saving cf 94,000 be made     There was, however, in commercial
circles strong opposition to this&apos; proposal and&apos; a ,deputationwhich he had received the previous day had pressed for themaintenance of at least a nucleus Departmente      It was^estimated that..,, by insisting, on further reductions atheadouarters and in the overseas services, it would be possible,while maintaining the essential part of the existing organisation-:.?X       .tp effect a saving cf scm  40,000&apos; en the Veto fcr the Depart-ment, in addition to the saving already shewn in theprovisional&quot;estimates fcr l$fc-2/25o-The Secretary cf State fcr India reminded the Cabinetthat .af&apos;oer consul tat ion with lord Ashfield and Lord Robert Cecil....   &apos; he had negotiated the present arrangement.. &apos;   To return to the&apos;       .position which existed before the Department cf Overseas Trade&quot;was set up would in his judgment toe-most; deplorable and would. , only result in reviving&apos;the confusion which used to prevail..The -view&apos; Was - expressed that the Department had.been,-   -;; ...organised cn unduly expensive lines and that pressure should be/brought to bear on the Department to - effect savings&apos; in/administrative / costs V  - &apos;&quot;&apos; -The Cabinet agreed --&apos;-&apos;   (1.)

The Chancellor of. the Exchequer, stated/that&apos; while hehad been in -faycur of adopting the recommendation of the geddes Committee - to- terminate this Department, the CabinetCommittee did hot &quot;share&apos;this view and&apos; recommended theadoption of the scheme: put forward by the Forestry Departmentwhich was estimated to cost  215,000, the greater proportionof which sum was already in hand and therefore the burden on the State in the next Estimates:would be triflingeThe Cabinet approved tfte recommendations&apos; of theCabinet committee  - .&apos; &apos; -. -
1 9 p1(30The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated thathis Committee did not agree v;ith the Oeddes&apos; Reportin recommending the distribution of the functions oftho wines&apos; Department among the various Ministriesfrom rhich they were token.    Instead, the committee recommend that the &quot;Department should be definitelymade a department, of the Bo?)rd of Trade, and that the.Secretaryship of ?;ines should give place to an under-Secretaryship of the Board of Trade.The Cabinet approved tho recommendation ofthe Cabinet Committee.Tho Committee agreed with tho sujryestion of  :the Minister of Labour that It should be made plainin any public report that the provision of  500.000only for the Exports ;0redits Scheme did not mean the stoppage of the scheme, but was due to the slow progress that had been made In taking up the scheme.The Cabinet concurred In the suggestions madeby the Minister of Agriculture and the Secretary forScotland that the question of the reduction In theamount of money available for Land Settlement shouldbe re-considered before the close.of the coming financial year, end that in the meantime no public statement should be .made which would lead to misunder-standin^s in regard to Government pledges to ex-Servioemen.It       -pointed out that this would not affectthe estimates for 1922/23.Subject to the above decisions the cabinet approved the recommendations contained in theReport of tho Cabinet Committee presided overby the Chancellor of the Exchequer.

The Geddes&apos;Committee propose that the net estimate of theColonial Office should be fixed at  678,866.,The Cabinet concurred in the proposal of-the geddes&apos; Committee,  it -being understood thata supplementary estimate might possibly berequired should there be a great increasein the number of persons desiring to settleoverseas..With regard to the.Middle East, the Secretary\ of State for the Colonies stated that he hoped to be.able to reduce the provision required for 1922/23 to 10,000,000 instead of  10,500,000, but he could hotaccept the Committee&quot;&apos;-s recommendation of a cut of 100,000 in the estimates for the Colonial Services,One effect of such reduction would be further to damage the economic life of Tanganyika,The Cabinet took note.of the statement ofthe Secretary&apos;of State for the Colonies inregard to the -Middle East,&apos; and approved ofthe estimates&apos; for.

ESi&apos;IuA!EiSW 2 2-19 23Sari Lament aryStatement by chancellor-&apos;, of exchequer.(6)       The Cabinet passed to the consideration ofthe character cf the statement on the financial situation of the country to be made by theChancellor of the Exchequer to the House ofCommons in the following week as a result of thedecisions reached by tho Cabinet in regard tothe recommendations of tho Committee on national expenditure.THE CHANCELLOR OE THE EXCHEQUER pointed outthat the reduction at which he had aimed in theyear 1982-1923 was  175 millions, of which 75 millions had haen secured by departmental action before the appointment of the geddes committee.     The reductions proposed by the geddes Committee amounted to  87 millions towhich they added. 13 millions aa further obtainableas a result of the VJashington Conference, economiesunder tho heading ox Oil Stocks and Storage, andunder a review of foreign garrisons abroad.   Asagainst this demand for  100 millions the total&apos; reductions authorised by the Cabinet amounted toabout  64 millions.     This would be regarded asunsatisfactory by the country and he wished theauthority of the Cabinet to promise the House ofCommons that the saving ef  100 millions would besecured in full in the course of the next twofinancial years.     He regretted that it had notbeen possible to obtain from the Cabinet permission to make more drastic reductions in the cost ofAdmiralty administration, whore the rates of pay and allowances were exceedingly high.
In the course of the aXs^j^^various considerations were advanced which, in theopinion of the Cabinet, should be put forward by theChancellor in his statement tc the House of Commons.These considerations, it was   suggested ought -to convincParliament and the country of the remarkable successinf the efforts of the Chancellor in reducing expond-iture in a most difficult period, yThe total economies proposed amounted to about 140 millions of which  130 millions would&quot; be operative in the coming financial year.       this included a reduction of about  67 millions in theFighting Services on last year&apos;s estimates,,   further economies might be possible in these Services inthe following year but they would largely depend upon the attitude of the United States snd Japan.The recent considerable growth in expenditure was attributable in the main to the cost of social services connected with problems of internal relief.Credit was due and should be generously expressed to, the Geddes. uommittee for its arduous labours andfor the fact that it had made possible an atmospherefavourable^o large economies.     On the other hand, it   *\7ould be unfair to the Departments to interpret theEstimates submitted last July by the Treasury as the lowest figures which they were prepared to accept.Experience showed.that as a result of conference with the Treasury these Estimates underwent importantmodifications.     The Geddes Committee had been askedto expose wastefizl expenditure and having &apos;eliminat&apos;fedsuch waste to indicate what would be involved in reducing expenditure to a certain hypotheticalfigure.     The amount of sheer waste revealed in thoReports was relatively negligible.
The burdea of the Hep art was that eearfeainservices, possibly desirable in themselves, were atpresent beyond the country&apos;s means and it had been theduty of the Cabinet to decide which or hew much ofthese services could.with safety be dispensed withoDeoision as to policy  rosted with the Cabinet and netwith the Committee cn national Expenditure,     The realposition was most clearly seon by examining the caseof education where the Geddes Committee recommended areduction of  18 millions and where the CabinC)t,sdeoision brought this down by two-thirds.     This hadbeen dene for two sound reasons of policy:    the fullreduction would involve a broach of contract with the teaching profession in respect of their salaries, orthe dismissal of was of thousands of teachers, and the exclusion of children under six from the schools - ameasure whioh would involve a storm of opposition in thelarge urban centres,     It was also desirable to makeplain to the country that in the case of the FightingServices that the Geddss Report recommended largegeneral outs of many millions without any preciseindication of how they were to be secured,    attention should also be directed to the fact that tho estimates in the last year of the war were  3146.millions andthat in a relatively short time these had been brought down to  1200 millions, a remarkable achievement whenregard was had to the internal and international difficulties which had beset this country since theconclusion of the war.Whitehall Gardens,, S.5V.9yebruary 84th. 1922,
