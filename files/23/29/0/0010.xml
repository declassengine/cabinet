EGYPT .(8) With reference to Cabinet 5 (.22), Conclusiion 2,the Cabinet had before them the following...docwyenbs..jc*elat-.lng to policy in Egypt1922 f Paper&quot; E .1488/1/16):1 A draft comwuiii cation to the Sultan ofEgypt from the High Commissioner (PaperA draft Declaration by the British Govern-ment to Egypt (Paper C.P.-3745 A),The Prime Minister reported to the Cabinet theresults of Conferences he and the Secretary of State for two days.   He first recalled the circumstances in which thepresent difficulties had arisen.   After the breakdown ofthe negotiations with Adly Pasha, Lord Allenby had ap-proached Sarwat Pasha with a view to the formation of aWnls+ry,    As the result of these negotiations, Sarwat Pashahad agreed to set up a Government on condition that, without waiting for the conclusion of a Treaty, His Majesty&apos;s Gov-ernment should abolish the protectorate, recognise Egyptas an independent Sovereign State, accept the re-establish-ment forthwith of an Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs,favour the creation of a Parliament with the right to control the policy and administration of a constitutionally responsi-ble Government, and abolish martial law.    Cnly after all this had been done were the points of special concern tothe British Government to be discussed4 e,g., security ofthe communications of the British Empire, the defence ofEgypt against all foreign aggression, protection of foreign interests in Egypt. The Cabinet, however, had decided thatin qo vital a matter it could not trust to luck, and that thepoints affecting the British Government must be definitelyreserved as part of th   arrangement.   Lord Allenby had then offered his resignation.    On this the Government hadForeign Affaiairs had had with Lord Allenby during the last
invited him to return to London to discuss the situation.Lord Allenby&apos;8 attitude had become well known in Pgypt before he left for England, and this had neceesarily affected his attitude in the recent Conferences.   The Prime Minister andlord Curzon, in their conversations with Lord Allenby, hadnot questioned his right to resign if there was a real dif-ference of opinion between the Government and himself, but had set themselves/So ascertain whether there, was in factsuch a difference of principle or merely a misunderstandingwhich could be cleared up.    The Prime Minister had askedwhether it was not correct to say that under Lord Allenby&apos;splan, when the Protectorate was abolished, he intended totrust to luck that agreement would be reached in regard tothe points essential to British interests,   Mr Amos, aBritish official in the Egyptian Ministry of Justice, whowas one of Lord Allenby&apos;s advisers, had replied that thiswas not the intention, and that the. status quo in4*egard tothese points would be unaffected.    The Prime Minister had then asked in which part of the document this was to befound, without eliciting any satisfactory reply.   The fact was that everything the Egyptians desired was provided forin the document.   Everything the British Government insisted on was left to the future.   The Prime Minister had then sug-gested that the position of the British Government- should bemade unmistakeahiy cl^ar on the face of the document.   lord allenby had replied that th-* document had been agreed textua-ly with Sarwat Pasha and his supporters, and that if therewas any material alteration he had no alternative/but to resign.He had insisted that his honour was. pledged to Sarwat Pasha,Eventually the Prime Minister had suggested that lord allenby&apos;s advisers should meet a representative of the Foreignj&quot; Office and Sir Edward Grigg, with a view to drawing up two documents, both based on Lord Allenby^ draft letter to the sultan enclosed with his telegram No.19 of January IS, 1922(Paper C.P.,-3614, No.4).   What the Prime Minister had laid stress upon was a draft Declaration by the British Government ;i
to Egypt, to be based on paragraphs 10 to 13 of Lord Allon-by&apos;s dran letter, though the original paragraph 17. was tobe considerably strengthened.   He had insisted on this being a short and separate document.   Lord Allenby had pressed forthe remainder of his draft letter to be incorporated in an*w 4&quot;&apos;^. l^-t+er to be sent on his own responsibility tothe Sultan as a. covering letter to the British Government&apos;declaration.    The meeting had taken place, Mr Amos, one ofLord Allenby*s advisers, being absent through indisposition,nowv/ith. the result, that the two documents before theCabinet had been drawn up (Papers C.P.-3745 and CP.-3745 A) .In regard to these documents Lord Allenby had written thefollowing letter:-&quot;February 16, 1922.My da:, r Prime Minister,The enclosed drafts are to my mindcouipl ^tely sntis^actorj&apos;&apos;.I am grateful to you for the generouscoirit in which you have met my proposals.My task in ^gypt will be greatly facili-tat*d&apos; by this el^ar declaration of His Majesty&apos;srovernment&apos;s policy.Yours sincerely,AI.L-N3Y.-The Prime Minister added that Sir Edward Grigg had drawn his attention to the fact that the terr &quot;status quo&quot;was used in the concluding sentence of the Draft Declarationf Append 1.x I) without further definition, so as to give theHigh Con-missioner the widest possible powers.   Under thisclause the High Commissioner could insist on maintainingpvt-rv power and privilege we now possess, .-ahd could vetoapVr notion inconsistent with those powers and privileges,Xt pave us our original basis under the Granville Declarationplus the powers (if need be) which we have sxiperadded sincethe declaration of the Protectorate.

 to Egypt, to be based on paragraphs 10 to 13 of Lord Allenby&apos;s draft letter, though the original paragraph 13 was to be considerably strengthened. He had insisted on this being a short and separate document. Lord Allenby had pressed for the remainder of his draft letter to be incorporated in a new draft letter to be sent on his own responsibility to the Sultan as a covering letter to the British Government&apos;s Declaration. The meeting had taken place, Mr Amos, one of Lord Allenby&apos;s advisers, being absent through indisposition, with the result that the two documents ? before the Cabinet had been drawn up (Papers C.P.-3745 and C.P.-3745 A). In regard to these documents Lord Allenby had written the following letter:-

 "February 16, 1922.

My dear Prime Minister,

 The enclosed drafts are to my mind completely satisfactory.

I am grateful to you for the generous spirit in which you have met my proposals.

 My task in Egypt will be greatly facilitated by this clear declaration of His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s policy.

 Yours sincerely,

 ALLENBY.

The Prime Minister added that Sir Edward Grigg had drawn his attention to the fact that the term "status quo" was used in the concluding sentence of the Draft Declaration (Appendix I) without further definition, so as to give the High Commissioner the widest possible powers. Under this clause the High Commissioner could insist on maintaining every power and privilege we now possess, and could vate any action inconsistant with those powers and privileges. It gave us our original basis under the Granville Declaration plus the powers (if need be) which we have superadded since the declaration of the Protectorate. The Prime Minister ended by commending the draft Declaration to the approval of his colleagues.
The Secretary of State *or Foreign Affairs supplement-the PriL o Minister&apos;s statement by explain4ng that theprocedure would b* that Lord Allenby should return to Egyptwith the two documents, and should endeavour to form, a S0v-errvent on this basis.    On its acceptance and the formationof an Egyptian Government, the Declaration would be presented to the British Parliament, and would not be-ratified until after a Debate in both Houses.In the. course of the subsequent discussion the attorney-General was asked whether the British Government&apos;proposed Declaration would have the force of a Treaty.   Sup-posing, for example, an Egyptian Government was set up as a sovereign Independent State, and, having joined the League ofNations, put in question the whole validity o&apos;5&quot; tie british position, would the Declaration sufficiently establish.Britishclaims?   &apos;*;as independence compatible with the conditions imposed?Sir Gordon H-wart said he was unable to say what-view-,the League of Nations would tak^,. but. the document mustundoubtedly be read as a whole, and the grant of independence,could not be separated from the conditions.Mr Balfour pointed out that in any event one dissenti-T&apos;1&quot; voifta was sir**j ci ent to pr^v^nt action by the League ofNations.The S^cr^tary of State for Foreign Affairs statedthat, he had felt -some misgivings in regard to the possibleattitude of the proposed Egyptian Parliament.   As the resultof-enquiries he had learn-d that a Constitution had been drawn up *or the proposed Egyptian Parliament.   EgyptianMinisters did not wish to b&quot; too much at the mercy of this body, and had provided for a- somewhat. old-fashioned Constitu-tion with two Chambers, one of which would be composed ofnominated members. - This would t*nd to alleviate the situa-tion,.
In the course of the discussion attention was drawn tothe inconsistency &quot;between Article I of the Draft Declaration,which declared Egypt to he an Independent Sovereign State,and Article 3, which reserved important matters to the discretion of His Majesty:s Government.-      This was felt tobe unavoidable.Some discussion took place in regard to the Draft letterto be sent by Lord Allenby (Paper C*Po-3745)0     Some criticismwas directed against Paragraph 5, but it was pointed out thatthis paragraph enunciated no new policy and was intendedmerely as a reply to criticisms of the despatch of December 3,1921.The suggestion Was made that the last sentence ofparagraph 6, viss-&quot;They are claimed without any desire to impairEgyptians enjoying full rights cf a national government&apos;^was hardly consistent with the reservations made in theinterests of British Imperial needs.     In view of Lord AllenbyJsinsistence on the suspicion whichWould be aroused In Egypt ifmaterial alterations were made in the Draftf It was consideredthat It would   suffice to alter the first words, &quot;they are claimed to &quot;they were claimed&quot;.In reply to a question, Lord Curzon informed his colleagues that the capitulations remained unaffected by the policycontemplated.     The negotiations already begun would becontinued by the British Foreign Office, with the co-operationof the Egyptian Foreign Office.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the draft Declaration to egypt (Appendix I);(b) That Lord Allenby should endeavour toform an Egyptian Government on the basisof this Declaration,.      Immediately onhis return to Egypt he should communicate the Declaration tc the sultan of Egypt.     The Declaration shouldbe simu.ltarecusly communicated to theBritish Parliament, but should not be ratified until after a Debate in bcthHouses:
(c) That Lord Allenby should boauthorised, on his own responsibilityas High Commissloner, to accompany the Declaration by the cover.lngletter (Paper C,. P. 3745), but that; in the last sentence of paragraph6 he should be asked to substitute the words &quot;they mere claimed&quot; for&quot;they&quot; are Glaimed&quot;V&quot;(d) In the event of his being unableto form a Government on the abovebasis, Lord Allenby should make such provisional arrangements as hemay deem advisable to govern thecountry pending the formation ofa constitutional Ministry.(e.) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should notify thispolicy to Lord Allenby.IRELAND. (3) The Cabinet were informed that,  as a resultRelease of       of communications with Sir James Craig,  the latterSinn Feinersarrested in     had offered to give favourable consideration to the(Ulster *question of the release of Certain Irish Republican army officers recently arrested in Ulster, after theIrish   Provisional Government had secured the releaseof.the Ulster residents recently kidnapped, on condition that the Provisional Government would recognise the validity of the decisions of the UlsterCourts and would give a solemn undertaking not to askin future for the release of any more prisoners on political grounds?      Sir James Gralg had also intimatedhis acceptance of the proposal to hold an impartialenquiry into tho Clones affair.
iAwr)* With reference to Cabinet 3 (32), Conclusion 3, the boundaries     Cabinet had under consideration the reply to be riven in &apos;of Ulster. &quot;&quot;&quot;the noxise of Commons by the&apos; Attorney-General to a question as to the interpretation placed by birr, on Clause XIV ofthe Treaty respecting the boundaries of Ulster.It was urged, on the one hand, that, having regardto the feeling of anxiety among many of the supporters ofthe Government on this question. It was most desirable thata definite pronouncement shouldhe made to the effect thatthe Government had in no way departed from the attitude which had been previously taken up on this subject,  andwhich had been explained to the House of Commons by thePrime Minister and the Lord Privy Seal in the Debate onthe Treaty last December.On the other hand, the opinion was expressed thatit would be most undesirable to make any statement whichwould in eny way conflict with the terms of the speech madeby the Secretary of State for the Colonies in introducing the Irish Bill, and that in particular it would be most dangerous for the Attorney-General to give any interpreta-tion of the meaning of Clause XIV, the interpretation ofwhich would have to be settled by the Boundary Commissionitself.The Cabinet agreed  That the Attorney-General should base his statement on the declarations made onDecember 14., 1921, in the House of Commons,by the Prime Minister and the Lord Privy .Seal, and. that at the same time hf shouldmake it clear that in his opinion theinterpretation of Clause XIV of the treaty was a matter&apos; *br the Boundary Commission,ch, in defining the boundaries inaccordance with the wishes of the inhabi-tarts,, would havo to do  so with due regardto economic and geographical conditions.
010 IN THTPUNITFDKINGDOM.5) T.Vith r^fer^nce to Cabinet 11 (21), 0Conclusion 8, theCabinet had befor * there a Memorandum by the President of theBoard op Trade (Paper CP.-3546) covering a Note by theSecretary for Mines respecting the question of oil produc-tion in the United Kingdom.ThR Cabinet were informed that an opportninity&quot;Triowpresentad itself for settling the legal proceedings institut-ed by the Duke of Devonshire, on terms -ander which the Dukewould forepo his claim to the oil already won and would takeover the plant on the site at a valuation, on condition thathis right to the remainder of the oil produced was definitelyrecognised and that he or his nominee was given a license towork the area on the usual royalty basis.   While this settle-ment Involved the reversal of the policy in pursuance ofwhich the Government had declared against private ownershipin oil and the right of landowners to exact royalties, suchreversal could be justified on the ground that as a result ofrecent developments it had been ascertained that oil produc-tion in the United Kingdom was never likely to become acommercial proposition.   Moreover, so long as the present uncertainty prevailed, it was out of the question for privateenterprise to ergage on any work of this character.Tho Cabinet agreed  To approve the proposed settlement with the duke of Devonshire on the lines suggested inthe Note by the Secretary for Mire s, notwith-sbanding that this settlerent involved reccgni-tioh by the State of private ownership in oiland the withdrawal of the Government ban onthe payment of royalties.o,    wv^ ten,&quot;. 11 Gardens,  S.% . * :&apos;   7 &apos;h&apos;.February 16, 19 p, 2.3.^.1
