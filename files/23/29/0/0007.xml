Steps had boon taken to schedule large areas,  and hitherto the Ministry of Agriculture had carried out the policy of slaughtering, which was undoubtedly the best, so long as it could be kept within reasonable dimensions,    But the outbreak might become so widespread as to make it impossible to risk the money involved in slaughtering all beasts whioh hadbeen subjected to the risk of infection.
