(1) With reference to Cabinet 16 (22) Conclusion 2, the Cabinet Had before them the following documents on the subject of Unemployment Insurance:-

The Report of the Unemployment Committee(C.P.3865) Appendix I.

The Draft of Bill giving effect to the Committee&apos;s Report, which was circulated during the discussion.

(C.P. 3689)

THE MINISTER OF LABOUR gave the Cabinet a summary of the Committee&apos;s proposals, namely, that the proposed legislation should provide for weekly benefits of 17/-for a married man plus l/- for each child. 12/- for a single man and 10/- for a single woman these fugures comparing with 22/-,15/-, and 12/- under the existing legislation: these reduced rates of benefit to become operative as from Thursday, April 13th. Emphasis was laid on two considerations; first, that the rate of benefit was to be reduced, and secondly, that there would be a hiatus of a week and a half in April during which no unemployment benefit would be paid. The cost of this scheme would involve an additional burden to the Exchequer of about £25,000,000 and, would involve an extension of the maximum borrowing powers of the Minister of Labour by £5,000,000.

THE LORD PRIVY SEAL, as Chairman of the Committee, explained that the Committee were continuing the assistance to wives and children at the same rate of benefit, and in view of the fact that the State was giving an uncovenanted benefit to people who had exhausted their right they were justified in reducing the  rates of benefit to the other beneficiaries.

THE SECRETARY FOR SCOTLAND pointed out the difficulty which the adoption of this scheme would cause in Scotland owing, first, to the small areas of administration in that part of the United Kingdom, and secondly, to the fact that Parliament had recently agreed that in Scotland the burden should be laid on the parish councils of providing poor relief
91 Owit)to destitute able-bodied persons out of employment.    (the poor Law Emergency Provisions (Scotland) Act).    If furtherburdens were laid on these small authorities their machinery would break down.     They were already pressing the Chancellorof the Exchequer for additional grants.      In his view either the benefits ought not to be reduced or the waiting periodsshould be shorter.This aspect of the question gave rise to a general discuss-ion as to whether in the existing unemployment situation itwas wise to cut down, the amount of the benefit at all.    iVarn-ings were given of the risk of grave disturbance if thiscourse was adopted.     In this connection the Government Actuarywas invited into the room and informed the Cabinet that thecost of maintaining.the existing rates of benefit wouldinvolve additional borrowing powers of  9,000,000, making 28f millions which, however, would probably be materiallyIncreased as the result of the present disturbances in theengineering and shipbuilding-trade, perhaps to  252 millions.If so large a deficit were reached it would umke very problem-atic its repayment because the contributors would refuse tobear the high rates necessary for a long enough period.THE CHAUCELLOB OF THE EXCHEQUES pointed out that there wasa widespread hope and anticipation that some reduction, wouldbe made in taxation in the forthcoming Budget.   This heavy additional burden would militate against this desideratum.He demurred to the proposal that the cost should be met by increasing the capital liabilities of the country.    Such acourse would involve borrowing which would be contrary to thefinancial policy we had hitherto pursued, of reducing ratherthan increasing debt, and would result in lowering the credit of the country to an extent which would entail losses far beyond the addition to the debt.
In the course of further discussion it was pointed out thatthe scheme did not apply to Ireland, since the British Government]responsibilities in Sorthern Ireland had already ceased andwould cease in southern Ireland on 31st March 1922.After considerable discussion the Cabinet agree the phanoellor of the gxcheguer asked thathis dissent from this conclusion should Ferecorded.        *(b) That the Bill should be redrafted togive effect to this conclusion.(c) That the Minister of Labour and theMinister of Health should be responsiblefor seeing- that the Bill conforms to thedecision of the Cabinet.(a) That the rates of Unemployment Insurancebenefi 17should remain as at present.(d) That the Minister of Labour shouldhave authority to introduce the Bill onFriday next.
K^TMBFRI?^ Cs) With reference to Cabinet 18 (22)* Cone Ins 1 on 8,fRADP. BIS-pijoiJ!, the Cabinet had before them Memoranda by the rinister ofLabour (Papers CP,-380? and CP.-5864) dealing with thepresent position of the dispute in the engineering trade.The Minister of Labour stated that the view he had put forward to the Cabinet as to the inexpediency of appointing a Court of ftnquiry while&apos; the ballots of theother Unions were being taken, had been endorsed In the debate in the House of Coiaiaona.   Since that Debate the two parties- had again approached each other.   If the results&apos;of the ballots were adverse to the employers, he did notthink there would be an liamadiate lock-out, hut that dis-cu a a ions would centime.   On the other&apos; hand, he thought it unlikely that the look-out notices row in force would hewithdrawn.
SHIPBUILDING        (8) With reference to Cabinet 15 (88), Oonclnsion 3,TRADE DISPUTE.the Cabinet had before them Memoranda by the Minister ofLabour (Papers&apos; G.F.-3810, CP.-3856 and 0.P.-3866) dealingwith the present position of the diepite in regard&apos; to wages in the shipbuilding traderThe Minister of labour informed the Cabinet thatthe employers had posted up notices intimating a reductionof wages of 10s.6d. p^r week from March 39th, and a further reduction of 6/- at the end of April,.   The representativesof the men were to meet in conference tomorrow, and theywould probably recommend that a ballot bo taken on thesenotices, and perhaps ask for a postponement of their operation beyond March 39th.The Cabinet agreed  -That the Lord Privy Seal; the Chancellorof the Exchequer, the Secretary forScotland, should&apos;be associated wit?  theMinister of Labour in watehing closely the course of the disputes in theEngineering and Shipbuilding industries.
i ikpsiWP COM-        (4)    in view of the. potential risks of a situation inLiTTft^ OTI THEIp^FGjpV^^lOIJ which there are two million unemployed ani serious disputesJORD^R. in the Engineering and Shipbuilding trades, the cabinet agreed  That a Cabinet Committee, composed asfollows  The Home Secretary (In the Chair),The First Lord of the Admiralty,The Secretary of State for War,The Secretary of State for Air,  &apos;The Minister Of Labour,The Secretary for Scotland,The Parliamentary Secretary to theMinistry of Transport,The ?-11 omay-Oem ral,Mr T.

If50VBRWMFW1?&apos; (B) With reference to Cabinet 58 (20), Conclusion 4,inVEBTISlR-fptTTP. IH &apos;&quot;&apos;;rrT&quot;   the Cabinet had before there a V mm ran dn in by the Chancellorof the Exchequer proposing to re rove the present embargoI on Government advertisements in the &quot;Pally Herald% inasraehas it was a good medium for furthering the sale of SavingsCertificates and that there had been a change in the- personnel of the &quot;card of Directors fPaper D.P.-5808),.&quot;lie fab 1 net agreed --^o adhere to the present policy.
O Ajii\   iftth rafarsnoa to Cabinet IS (&quot;&amp;&amp;) Conclusion 4, theCabinet had before them mi. extract from the draft Minutesof a mooting of the Home Affairs Committee held oa March 1st (0.^,3870) dealing with, a national Health Ixjaar-aaee Hill prepared by tho Minister of Health (CP.3838) *SEE MIHISflhiH OP HEALTH explained that as a result ofa conference with the Consultative Council of approved societies it bad been agreed that any increase at presentin the rates of contribution would asset with strong: oaposit .ion-   la vlw4 however, of the need for eeoncaayand theproposals of the Committee on JIatioxial Expenditure, Whiohhad been endorsed by the Cabinet, the Societies had agreedto accept a scheme whioh. would secure the economies desired by drawing on the surplus of the Societies instead of levy-ing additional contributions,,   This was a departure fromthe precise me thee approved by the Cabinet,     At the meet-lag of the Home Affairs Committee on the previous day, thefinancial Secretary of the Treasury bad objected that onthe termination of the Minister of Health&apos;s scheme in Baa,19S3- there would probably bo recourse to the Treasury for fresh grants and he asked the Committee to embody in thepresent Hill the principle that further grants from theTreasury would be barred.     This he suggested could be doneby repealing Section I of fee nations! Health insuranceAct 1913,THE cHAllCELLGH OP THE S&amp;CHH^UPIK Stated that the object-ion of the Treasury was that the schema simply postponedtrouble to December IS23 and was a short sighted arrangementbecause after that period the approved Soeiefci.es would again look to the Treasury to make good the deficits.THE &amp;LBIS2SB OP HEALTH stated that it was impossible at present to increase the Health insurance contributionsowing to the high rate of unemployment Insurance contributeions, but if the lattor are reduced by December 1983 It-11-
9 9 9I.would be &apos;easier to advance the former.   To remove all state assistance above the statutory two-ninths would be to surrender the weapon which the State can use in dealingwith the doctors and to hand them over to the approved societies.     To do this would raise a storm of opposition&apos;in the medical profession and gravely endanger thostructure of medical benefit now embodied in the HealthInsurance Act.The PBESXDK8T Of THS BOARD OF EDUCATION as Chairmanof the Home Affairs Committee, stated that except for theFinancial secretary to the -Treasury the Committoe were unanimously in favour of the proposals of the Minister ofHealth.The Cabinet agreed -To approve the- proposals of the Ministerof Health and authorised the introductionof tho National Health Insurance Bill.-12-
(10) The Secretary of state for the Colonies asked thatthe Cabinet should be afforded an opportunity in good timeto discuss the financial situation of the country in relationto the forthcoming Budget.The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that it was proposed to introduce the Budget on fay 1st.TTie Cabinet instructed the Secretaryto brin* the request of the Secretaryof State for the Colonies to thenotice of the Prime Minister.
IRRIAT-m, (11)    With reference to Cabinet   16(32), Conclusion i %nitration        the Lord Chancellor stated that the prospects of the Irishon the boundary .        Treaty Bill going through the House of Lords were extremelygood if no grave untoward event took place on the borderbetween Northern and Southern Ireland, and he wished to boassured, that everything possible was being done to grapplewith, the situation on the border.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that members of the Irish Republican s army and of the special constabulary had been allowed to core dangerously neareach ether on the boundary. - lie himself had wished tofollow the Silesian precedent and draw a cordon by meansof British troops, but his proposal had been resisted bythe late Chief of the Imperial General Staff.   He stillthought it would he possible to place troops at criticalpoints, and understood that the Secretary of State forWar vras prepared to do this, and that such action would meet with the assent of the Governments of the Worth andSouth.   He very much, dreaded a collision.   If we took the ao.tion suggested. It would then be possible for himto press Sir James Craig to meet Mr Collins in ccnferor.eeand. to obtain from &quot;r Collins a repudiation, of the revoltson the part of the Irish Republican Army.The Secretary of State for War said that the questionof semiring something equivalent to a neutral belt was being examined by the General staff,&quot;lie Cabinet agreed  &quot;&quot;hat the whole question should be considered,immediately by the Provisional Government ofIreland Committee, and that the Lord chancellor should be invited, to attend..The Cabinet took note that Viscount Peel hadtaken the place of Mr Montagu as a member ofthe Committee.

A similarpolicy of amalgamation was to be followed in the ease of theLine Regiments.   He also informed the Cabinet that the pro-posals had been submitted&apos;to His Majesty the King, and hadthe approval of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff andof Field Marshal Lord Raig.;.&apos;  The Cabinet approved the recommenda-,   tlons of the Secretary of State forWar.
(14) Tiift Secretary of State for War - stated that he wishedto correct a statement he had made at a recent meeting ofthe Cabinet.

1. With reference to H.A.C. 85, Conclusion 3, the Committeehad Tinder consideration the Report of the Valuation and RatingReform Committee (CP. 3544) and Memoranda thereon by theMinister of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Minister of Health(CP. 3770 and CP. 3819).The Committee were reminded of the nature of the principlesembodied in the Report, and it was suggested that, assumingacceptance of those principles, the question would arise whether inall the circtunstances a Bill should be drafted. The drafting of sucha Bill would mean heavy work for the Parliamentary Counsel, and itwould be most undesirable to publish a draft Bill unless the Govern-rnent were resolved to proceed with the measure. On the otherhand, it was pointed out that it was very difficult to estimate theeffect of the Committee&apos;s proposals without seeing them in legislativeform.The Minister of Agriculture informed the Committee that,while he was in general sympathy with much of the Report, he was convinced that the proposals, if adopted, would have the effect ofincreasing the present heavy burdens on agricultural land, and would accordingly meet with strong opposition both in Parliament and inthe country. He would like to have more time to consider theproposals contained in the Minister of Healths Memorandum(CP. 3819) as it seemed to him that his objections to the report could probably be overcome either in the directions indicated in theMemorandum or in other ways. He did not object to the proposals in the Report relative to the part to be played by the Crown asregards valuation.- The Secretary for Scotland urged that the Committee shoulddefer coming to any final decision until after the receipt of thePteport of Lord Dunedin&apos;s Committee, which might be expectedshortly.The Committee agreed  (1.) To defer further consideration of the Report of the valuation and Rating Reform Committee (CP. 3544) with a viewto the examination by the Ministry of Agriculture andFisheries, the Ministry of Health and the Treasury ofthe question whether, and, il so, to what extent, theagricultural objections to the Report could be met.(2.) To request the Chairman to consult with the Lord privy seal as to the practicability of introducing legislation onthis subject in the present Session.2. The Committee had under consideration Memoranda CP. 3563and CP. 3583 by the Minister of Health and the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries on the question of the rating of machinery.The Committee were reminded of the desirability of removing the uncertainty as to the law on this subject and of placing Englishmanufacturers on the same basis as regards the rating of theirmachinery as their Scottish and Irish competitors.On the other hand, emphasis was laid on the oppositiozi whichwould be raised to proposals such as those in the Bill annexed to cp. 3563 by ordinary ratepayers in both rural and urban areas andon the objections to dealing piecemeal with items of rating reform.The Committee agreed That it was undesirable that the Government should introduce legislation on the subject of the rating of machinery at thepresent time.
Road conveyance of Goods byRailwayCompanies.3. The Committee had under consideration a Memorandum bythe Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport (CP. 3785)from which it appeared that the North-Western and Midland group of Railway Companies were seeking power under a Bill to work asystem of road vehicles in any district to which their lines gaveaccess, for the conveyance of merchandise and passengers. Underthe present law apart from any particular provisions in special acts of Parliament, Railway Companies could only do so if the trafficoriginated on their own lines. The proposal was very controversial and had aroused opposition on the part of Carrying Companies andLocal Authorities.The Ministry of Transport asked for a derision on policy on thesecond reading of the Bill.The view was expressed that though none of the safeguardsprovided in the Bill, or under existing legislation, afforded completeprotection from abuse, their accumulated effect would ber-to safeguard the interests of traders, road transport undertakings and the general public.It was recommended that the Government should state on second reading of the Bill in the House of Commons that they recognised the fears of traders, Local Authorities, and other transport undertakings : should point out the difficulty of deciding upon theprinciple of the Bill until the safeguards which could be devised toprevent the growth of a monopoly had been considered in Committee,and should reserve their final decision until the third reading.In reply to a question whether the Government accepted thegeneral principle that Railway Companies should carry on road transport business, it was pointed out to the Committee that someRailway Companies already had power to do so under their special acts of Parliament, that the only reason why any Railway Companyneed come to Parliament was because road traffic business wasoutside their charter, and that the only persons who could bring an action to restrain them from carrying on road transport would be one of their own shareholders.The Committee agreed That during the debate on the second reading of &quot; The Railways-(North-Western and Midland Group) Bill, 1922,&quot; in theHouse of Commons (I.) A statement  should be made  on behalf  of theGovernment (i.) That the Government recognise the fears of traders, of owners and users ofmechanically-propelled vehicles, and ofLocal Authorities ;(ii.) That it is difficult to decide on theprinciple of the Bill until there has beendetailed consideration in Committee ofthe safeguards which can be devised toprevent the growth of an oppressivemonopoly;(hi.) That the Government recommend theHouse to send the Bill to Committee,the final decision of the government being reserved until third reading.(2.) That the Government Whips should be taken off onthe vote for the second reading of the Bill.[8021]B 2
Harbours, Docksarid Piers(temporary increase of charges) Bill.4. &quot;With reference to H.A.C. 99, Conclusion 1, the Committeehad under consideration a Memorandum by the parliamentary secretary to the Ministry of Transport (CP. 3755), covering thedraft of a Bill extending the increased charging powers of harbours,docks and piers owned by Railway Companies until the lothFebruary, 19:25, together with a re-draft of the Bill (see Appendix),which was circulated at the meeting-.The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transportstated that he had been in communication with representatives of ship owners and the Federation of British Industries, and as far ashe was aware there would be no opposition to the Bill.The Committee agreed To approve the Harbours, Docks and Piers (Temporary Increaseof Charges Bill), and to authorise the parliamentary secretary to the Ministry of Transport to arrange for its introduction in Parliament.Tramways Controlof ChargingPowers.5. With reference to H.A.C. 99, Conclusion 1, the Committeehad under consideration a Memorandum by the parliamentary secretary to the Ministry of Transport (CP. 3756), on the proposalto make permanent the present temporary legislation wherebycharges for tramway undertakings are fixed by the Minister ofTransport on the advice of a Committee.The Home Affairs Committee had decided at the meetingabove referred to that the question should be postponed for furtherconsideration. A Bill was now submitted showing the exact effectof the proposals made, which, it was understood, were being-supported by a large majority of the municipal tramway under-takings, to whom enquiries had been addressed. They also receivedthe unanimous support of private tramway undertakings.The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transportstated that, as the result of further enquiries, he found that he-could not now advise that any further steps should be taken than to include &quot; The Statutory Undertakings (Temporary Increase of charges) Act, 1918,&quot; and &quot;The Tramways (Temporary Increase of charges) Act, 1920,&quot; in the Expiring Laws Continuance Act. It was felt that strong opposition would be met with in Parliament to anyproposal permanently to deprive Parliament of its right to hearapplications from tramway undertakings, by way of private Bills orProvisional Orders, for permission to increase their charges the Committee agreed in the course recommended by theParliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport.Poot and mouth disease.Diseases of AnimalsBill, 1922.6. With reference to Cabinet 15 (22), Minute 7, the Committeehad under consideration a Memorandum by the Minister of Agri-culture and Fisheries (CP. 3821;, covering the draft of &quot; the diseases of Animals Bill, 1922,&quot; to remove temporarily the limit onmonies provided by Parliament for the purposes of the Diseases of animals Acts.It was stated in the Memorandum that in consequence of theagreement sanctioned by the Cabinet, that the cost of the recent out-break of Foot and Mouth Disease should be divided equally betweenthe Exchequer and the rates, it would be necessary to authorise the
payment of 500,000?. into the Cattle Pleuro-Pneumonia Account.At present a limit of 140,000?.. was imposed by Section 18 of &quot;the diseases of Animals Act, 1894,&quot; on the monies which might beprovided by Parliament for.this purpose.The Minister of Agriculture stated that the details of the bill had been agreed with the Treasury.The Committee agreed To approve the draft of the &quot; Diseases of Animals Bill, 1922,&quot;and to authorise the Minister of Agriculture to arrange forits introduction in Parliament.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,March 10, 1922.APPENDIX.Harbours, Docks and Piers (Temporary Increase of Charges).Redraft of a, Bill to Amend and Extend the Duration of &quot; The Harbours, Docks andPiers (Temporary Increase of Charges) Act, 1920.&quot;Be it enacted by the King&apos;s Most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons in this present parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows :  1.
