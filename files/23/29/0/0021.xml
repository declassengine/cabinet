SECRETARY.*1 9Lip: NEAR -RAST. (1) With reference to Cabinet 19 (22)., Conclusion 3,Lr?IC COSJt^FP-^works. the Prime Minister, on behalf of the Cabinet, congrattt-longratuiatiens la ted lord Cnrr.cn on the very remarkable success he hadlo the Secre-fary of State achieved at Paris in reconciling the apparently widelylor&quot; ForeignIff a Ira. conflicting views of the British, French and italian governments and reaching agreement as tc equitable bases for a -Treaty of Peace with Turkey.
5 FORTHCOMING   (2) With reference to Cabinet 19 (22), Conclusion 2, thellPERRNCE ATUfOA. Prime Minister stated that the question of the Genoa Confer-0U3-   Ofence fell into two parts.    There was, first, the ResolutionUrinonsftolution.     to he submitted to the House of Commons on Monday next,April 3, and, secondly, the character of the instructionsto be given to the Delegates.The Lord Privy Seal stated that he had indicated tothe House of Commons that the Resolution to&quot; be proposed onMonday next would be in connection with the Genoa Conferenceand not a general Vote of Confidence.   He proposed to laythe Cannes Resolutions and two explanatory appendices or.the Table on the following day.    The Resolution which hadbeen prepared read as follows:-&quot;That this House approves the resolution passed by the Supreme Council at Cannesas the basis of the Genoa Conference andwill support His Majesty&apos;a Government in giving effect to them.&quot;The Lord. Privy Seal proceeded to remind the Cabinet of theResolutions passed at Cannes, and read to the Cabinet themore important of these, which are set out in paper CP.-3657.   :IThe Cabinet agreed to the Resolution andthe procedure indicated by the Lord privy seal.
fc^pCBTRCOWIHO   (S)    The Prime Minister said that perhaps it would assistf r*wr*.        bis oolleaffnes in their consideration of the Genoa Conferencepat ructions   if he war* to state the case in the ferra of two propositions[ff. Delegates.fa) The economic proposition, namely, theeconomic conditions under which ourtraders can he induced to undertaketrade in Russia,(b) The larger question at the base of our economic troubles, rarely, the positionunrest in the East, which disturbsthe trader and makes him suspicions.-With regard to the second point, there was a stateo* sor.-e th.ing like menace along the Russian frontier.   russia was full of suspicion of&quot; the intention.?? of Rotuisania, Poland,Finland, and ether neighbouring countries, who were equallysuspicious of Russia.   One half of Re rope was living undera cenditlne of menace of war, and it was absolutely necessaryto restore the sense of peace in Europe.   ,T*he first objectof the Genoa Conference should therefore fee to establish a pact among all the nations of Europe against aggression.Russia must undertake not to attack Roumania, Latvia,Lithuania, Poland and .Finland, and vice/ verga,.   Until some such condition cf peace was established there would not bean effective revival of trade.   The President of the Boardof &quot;Yade had prepared a valuable document, after eonsulta-tion with leading business representatives-, which indicatedserious industrial and commercial prospects for at least twovears to come (Paper 0 .T&apos; .-8890) .   Mr Baldwin&apos;s Memorandumshewed f^e.t, very little diminution of unemployment was to beexpected in the near fnture, owing in part, to the inter-national situation.   rr,he problem of unemployment would need,to be considered alao apart from the discussions which wouldtake place in Genoa.With regard to Russia, we had made efforts to restoret.radiw relations with that country which had been only
partially snoceasfi.il, because the Soviet Government had failed to carry out the conditions as strictly as we had   &apos;a right to *xpect:    Tart the fact remained that Russia was still outside the comity of nations, and until that fact was changed the full restoration of trade would be difficult .Cur first object should be to establish, peace, and oursecond object to establish complete commercial relationswith Russia.   This raised the question of the extent towhich those objects involved the recognition of Russia.He did not believe it was possible to get. trade going until there was some degree of recognition.   Access to Courts oflaw was essential to the carrying on of trade.   Thereforeseme measure of recognition was absolutely essential *Three questions arose at that stage!- -(a) Should the recognition be complete?(b) If complete, short Id there be a timeele;sent int r odu e e d ?fa) r&quot;&apos;o what extent is Great Britain preparedto act alone?tfft thought it was generally agreed that Great &quot;britain should not act absolutely alone.   On the other band, if we-said that we would never recognise Russia itnt.il all were agreed   that would be to give notice to countries (e.g.Prance) which stand least in need of Russian trade, toexercise a veto on any possible agreement.   Ho self-respecting Delegates could go to Genoa fettered in that way.   He agreed that whatever -action was taken should be.taken by Europe as a whole.Next, as to the question of a probationary period during which it would be possible to test the bona fideaOf the Soviet Government, the Home Secretary bad circulated a r^netr fopnr^^f an interview with a Russian trader, whorepresented a very important Corporation.   &quot;According to-4-
t&quot;Ms trader, Twir was personally largely responsible forthe promulgation of the recent econotric laws,, which amountto an abandonment of Communism.   If the Russian Delegationcame to Genoa having practically surrendered their Gomnunist&apos;-ic principles and willing to enter into negotiation withCapitalistic communities, we ought to give all necessarysupport, to.the anti-Oomraunistic elements in Russia, anddeclare that if Communistic principles are abandoned we are ready to assist in the economic development of Russia.   Hewas prepared, in the name of the&apos;Cabinet, to tell the C-ele-gatas that they would not be accorded full diplomatic andceremonial representstion until the Powers had had anopportunity rs*&quot; satisfying themselves that a cennine attempthad been wade to carry out the decisions reached at Genoa.Tn the ease of Germany there had been a considerable interval between the signing of the Pact- and the granting of fulldiplomatic representation.The lord Privy Seal stjggested that there should bethe &quot;kind of recognition which enabled each Power to protectits citizens,- ^ne Prime Minister agreed, ard said there should be some inducement put on Russia to expedite the carrying outof her obligations .The Secretary of State for the Colonies asked ifffcnssis was      have Consuls?*r*he Prime Minister replied that that was already part....of the Trade Agreement,- but he thought they were called&quot;Agents&quot;.   &quot;he appointment of Consuls would be subject tothe assent of the Government.   The proposal was that Russia-should have a Charge&apos; d*Affaires in London, and. we should-have a similar representative In Moscow. He suggested thatthe Charge&quot; d* Affaires should occupy a position lite thatoccupied: for a period by Dr Sthanfer.-5-
The lord Privy Seal aaid that if the ease of Dr sthamardid not qtiite fit, a new precedent could he made.   The pre-liminary to any form of recognition was the full acceptancein substance cf the Cannes conditions:    recognition was limited by excluding the Charge d&apos;Affaires from presentationat. Court, and full recognition would only he granted after further decision by the Cabinet,The Pri*-o Minister, in reply to a question, by the Presidentof the Board of Education, said he thought the French would agree to co-operate on the lines now proposed.   So also would TOr Penes.&apos; The Secretary of State for Foreign /ffairs said that he attached great importance to the phrase -used by the PrimeMinister as to the desirability of acting with Europe as awhole.   It was Impossible to be more precise at present, as no-one knew the degree of Russians acceptance of the Cannesconditions.   Only in its later stages would the Genoa conference** be in a position to come to a decision as to recognitionor no recognition, or the sort of- recognition.   In his vieweither the Rn**ff*ans at that stage would have establishedclaims to confidence and recognition or. they would, not.    Itwould be ridiculous for us to stand out  for or against recog-nition if the great majority of the other Powers were opposed.Be himself attached more importance to acting with Europethan to f*ny ether point.    That had been the most valuable,result, of the recent Conference en the Hear Fast.The Lord Chancellor, in. reply to questions by lord Curaonand Mr Baldwin, stated that de jure, recognition was used in contrast with de facto, and implied that, as a matter of lav?in all Constitutional and ceremonial matters you admit, a nation fully into the comity of nations.    If the former pcsi-tien was on^ wh^re the representative was an Ambassador,you.restored that representation unless there had been a notable   3contraction of area, as, for example, in the case of Austria. JIn effect, anything that went beyond de facto recognitionwas de jure.The Secretary of State for India remarked that what was newproposed was a limited de jure recognition.
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES said that he saw considerable difficulty in giving a final authority to the British Delegates in this important matter without a reference back to the Cabinet here. This was the last the Cabinet would hear on the subject and the decision of the three Delegates would be filed in Genoa whether the conditions laid down were fulfilled or not. He recalled that the Russian Trade Agreement had been accepted by the Cabinet on the understanding that if its terms were violated it could be terminated. As a matter of fact its terms had since been repeatedly broken. Now we were asked to go still further to meet the Soviet Government.

He had not much confidence in any Russian trade revival in the next two or three years which would exercise any important influence on employment in this country. He thought it was right to meet the Russian representatives in Genoa. He then read a most gloomy account from our representative at Moscow which indicated that the sole purpose of the Soviet Delegation at Genoa would be to use the occasion to improve their prestige at home. This, he said, could be supported by innumerable quotations from the utterances of Soviet leaders. They would sign papers which they did not mean to honour and would go back reinforced by the fact of having conducted negotiations with the chief capitalist country of Western Europe. This would enable them to rivet their shackles even more closely on the ignorant peasants. Meanwhile, there were 3 million intelligent Russians living in exile and when they heard that it was proposed to grant de jure recognition it would strike them with despair. He was bitterly sorry that at a time of strong Conservative mayorities in a country deeply devoted to the monarchy it was proposed to record this supreme favour and patronage to the Bolsheviks. If there were going to be some alleviation of unemployment it would be different, but on that head he was sceptical.

He was bound also to take note that the Cabinet were to a large extent already committed at Cannes, and as he did not protest at the time he was to that extent involved. He wished there had been an opportunity of considering these questions at the time. In the case of the Anglo-French fact there had been a special Cabinet decision. He wished it had been possible for the Cabinet to meet in a similar way


to discuss the aondl tions of the isooaomio Conference,     lie was grateful to the xrime Minister for the distinction he had drawnMlbetween partial de jure recognition for trade and froyomonlaftrecognition..     Me should like to know what line the Prime minister proposed to take ia his statement to the douse of commons.   TheBesolution eoiamifcted the Government to recognition of the soviet republic.    hat would cause pain in many quart ore and it would be helpful if the  rime Minister would state that the intention wasto take%no  -practical steps as were necessary for the restorationof trade.TEE i&apos;Kim MIifiIS2.BE said that he proposed to say substantially to the House of Commons what he had that morning- told the Cabinet.He was going to say definitely that H.il.SOvemmsttt wars disappointedwith the actions of tho Ruasian Government and must be assuredat Genoa that there was a bona fide acceptance of the conditions laid down-TEE 1GBD PKIVY SML said that Inasmuch as va number of ministers would bo at Genoa and others might bo scattered for the Eastervacation it would bo desirable to give the Delegates a limiteddiscretion, within which they could act, Ministers being meanwhilekept fully informed of the course of the proceedings.     I*he limits which had emerged in the course of the discussion were broadly asfollows(a) .ve are not to act in isolation nor without a generalconsensus of opinion.(b) There can be no advance in our diplomatic relations withRussia unless they accept the substance of the Cannesconditions.to) In the event of their accepting these conditions and ofour Delegates, in the course of the negotiations,concluding that the acceptance is boha fide, we willgrant that diplomatic recognition which is required tomake the agreement a success, but will not give fullceremonial recognition beyond that involved la theappoint meat of a Charge d&apos;Affaires.Tm E2&amp;2GB MillSSEB remarked that these wore tremendousrestrictions mid while the Delegates could not be bound to detailsthe governing consideration was that indicated by Mr Chamberlain-8-
when he said that in substance the conditions of Cannes must be accepted. Payment of debts incurred by predecessors, for example, was at the root, of civilised goverment. 

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES asked if it were proposed to say to France that if she did not take our line no further progress would be made with the Anglo-French Fact. In his opinion that would be to use an unfair threat.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said the position had been made quite clear to the French at Cannes when it was laid down that the conclusion of the Pact would not be pursued until other questions outstanding between us had been cleared away.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had not intended to use any threat in the way suggested by Mr Churchill but he believed it would be useful to reserve the Pact to bring pressure on France in connection with Reparations and the treatment of Germany generally.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said that he had ascertained in reference to a point mads earlier in ? discussion by the Prime Minister that the Treaty with Germany had been ratified in January 1920. We had sent a Charge d&apos;Affaires to Berlin (Lord Kilmarnock) and the Germans had sent a Charge d&apos;Affaires (Dr Sthamer) to London, who six months later became their Ambassador,but during that six months although he did go to Court he was not received by the King. He thought it would probably be necessary to create a new diplomatic practice in the case of the Russian representative.

THE MINISTER OF LABOUR said that he feared the Resolution and the procedure to be followed on Monday by the Government would be regarded as an astute device to turn a difficult political corner 

THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE said it would go a long way to minimise criticism of the Government if the Prime Minister in his speech would state that full de jure or diplomatic recognition would only be given to Russia after a probationary period and


subject to ratification by Parliament.fHl PR&amp;IE HIIIISIER said that the decision of the genoa Conference would certainly come before the Houseof Commons.She Cabinet agreed that(a) The British Delegates to the GenoaConference should &quot;be given discretion to conduct the negotiations subject tothe following limitations in respect ofthe recognition of the Soviet Government -(i) The British Government should notact in. isolation nor without ageneral consensus of opinion amongthe States represented at Genoa;(ii) fhe re can be no advance in Britishdiplomatic relations with &quot;Russiaunless the Russian Government fullyaccepts the substance of the Cannesconditions;(iii) In the event of their acceptingthese conditions and of the british delegates, in the course of thenegotiations, concluding that theacceptance is bona fide, the BritishGovernment will, during a pr obation-ary period, receive a Charged*Affaires in London and will send a British Charge d1 Affaires to russia to facilitate the execution of the; &apos; &apos; agreement.&apos;    But the British Govern-ment will not grant full and cere-monial diplomatic representation tothe Russian Government until exper-ience has shown that the agreement has &quot;been loyally observed on-thepart of the Russian Government,    fheRussian Charge d*Affaires will notbe received by the Xing nor invitedto any Court function.     Under theterms of this arrangement, Russiansubjects will have access to Britishcourts of justice, and British sub-jects to Russian courts of justice,which latter will be reconstitutedfor that purpose.(b) fhe resitlts of the Genoa Conference shouldbe subject to approval by Parliament.
pLF.GATP.3 PGR       (4) The Prime Minister stated that the Convening PowersMB GENOA COK-pKPNOF AMP     proposed to meet at Genoa on April 9th.   He had alreadypjfTS. scon Signer Sehanser on the previous day, and hoped itwould he possible to see J, Poincare in Paris on his way.   to Genoa.   He proposed to go to Genoa accompanied by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Chancellorof the Exchequer.   He was glad to be able to inform hiscolleagues that the Lord Chancellor would be in the neigh-hourhood, and he would be glad to have the assent of theCabinet to his calling him into consultation, more especial-ly when certain vital principles of policy were being eon-sidered.   When the stage of general discussion was ever, itwas not Improbable that he himself, as well as the Secretaryof State, for Foreign Affairs ana the Chancellor of theFvcbeqwer, might have to return home in connection with- Parliamentary, international and financial business.   Atthis stage, when the decisions of principle had to beapplied practically, he ashed the Cabinet for authority :to allow the Secretary of State for War to replace theoriginal Delegates.The Cabinet concurred in these arrangements.
ROYAL IRISH CONSTABULARY

(5) With reference to Cabinet 18 (22), Conclusion 3 the Cabinet had before them copies of telegrams dealing with the disbandment of the Royal Irish Constabulary, which had been circulated by the Chief Secretary for Ireland (Paper C.P.-3897).

The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that since the negotiations with the Royal Irish Constabulary there had been a series of horrible murders of members of the Force in Calway, Cork, Rathmines, and elsewhere. Many of the Constables believed their lives to be in constant and deadly peril, and he thought the Cabinet would agree that, without adding to the pecuniary rewards already determined, every facility and assistance should be given to these threatened men, with their families, to come over to this country if they so desired, the cost to be borne by the Government and not to be taken into account by the Tribunal when calculating the amount of Disturbance Allowance payable to a man under Section II of the Terms of Disbandment.

The Cabinet concurred in these proposals.

puftlCATIOHIf CANNESrBSOLUTIONS.(l)    The Conference agreed  That the- Cannes: Resolutions&apos;,  together- with the explanatory Memorandum,&apos;paper c.P.-S657&apos; f excluding those portionsdealing with Reparations),, should bepublished as a Command Paper as soonas possible, in vi*er of the forthcoming debate on the- G^noa Conference.-1-
I Jfe $sowngl THE ROUSTQF COMMONS .(S)  The Prime Minister said that he contemplated a simple Resolution approving the Genoa &quot;Conference;    approvering the Cannes Resolutions as the basis of the Genoa Gon-Serenee*    and pledging support to the Government in carry--ing this out.   He did not-contemplate any Vote of Confi-dence.The Lord Privy Seal agreed in this proposal.The Price Minister pointed out that Sir W. Joynson-Hicks had put down a Motion to be discussed two days afterthfi Genoa resolution, when the question of confidence couldbfi discussed, if necessary.
&amp;k ft?j umjh&amp; GBBOA.&apos;       3.     -this be-bus MIBISTjSB said lie did not know if a general- statement was required in regard to tho Genoa Conference,clearlywhich was already/&apos;overdue.     Ho drew attention to a document recently circulated by the  resident of theBoard of Trade (CP..38 90) watch contained most disquiet-ing inf oxaaat ion about the iuture prospects of the trade of this country.     -This Memorandum confirmed the opinionhe himself had formed as the result of his own enquiries.It v-as clear that we were in for a period of bad trade for two years or longer.     This was due partly to theiiapoverishia&amp;ut of the world.     As yet it had proved impossible to start European trade.     There had been one Conference at Brussels, whioh had produoed a verycomplete report.     However, nothing had come of it.The reason for tnia was that the Governments had been represented only by experts.     It was now essentialthat the political representatives of Governments should meet and endeavour to arrange something to re-establish the trade of Europe.     Owing to the attitude of theFrench Government, one of the questions affecting theexchange, namely, reparations, was ruled out of the GenoaConference.     Bo doubt this would have to be taken-up oneof these days.     Whether it.could be settled withoutthe co-operation of the United States of America; however,was doubtful.     In any event, Franco had made it quite clear that she would not discuss the question in thepresence of nations that had been neutral in the War.There remained., however, the important questions of theexchange, transit, reconstruction, and derelict Europe,more particularly Austria and Bussia.      These were very important questions.     Perhaps the most difficult wasthat of the exchanges.      On this it would be necessary totake the advice of experts.     Whether the question wouldbe dealt with by a stabilisation of the exchange or bysou.: less Vcfiable medium being taken as a basis, he was
-* -J Iunable to say.      On.these technical questions he did not anticipate any difficulties beyond those which wereinherent in them.     They were not &quot;beset witn political difficulties.     The most difficult question that uenoahad to deal with was that of Kussia.     As regards Russia,the Allied experts nsd &quot;been meeting for some days.     Hethen drew- attention-to the fundamental conditions laiddown., in the resolution reached hy the Supreme Comaeilat Cannes on January 6th,  1^22&apos;, which he proceeded to read as follows ;-&apos;*1.     nations can claim no right to dictate to each other regarding the principles on whichthey are to regulate their system of owner-ship,  internal economy and government.      Itis for every nation to choose for itself thesystem which it prefers in this respect.2.      Before, however, foreign capital can bemade available to assist a eouutry, foreigninvestors must be assured that their property and their rights will&apos; be respected and the fruits of their enterprise secured to them.&apos;3.     The sense of security cannot be re-estab-lished unless the Governments of countriesdesiring foreign credit freely undertake :-(a) That they will recognise all publicdebts and obligations which have beenor may be undertaken or guaranteed by the State, by municipalities,  orby other public bodies, as well asthe obligation to restore or compen-sate all foreign interests for loss or damage caused to them when theproperty has been confiscated orwithheld.(b) That they will establish a legal andjuridical    system which sanctions and enforces commercial and othercontracts with impartiality.4.     An a deque to met. as of exchange must beavailable, and, generally, there must befinancial and currency conditions whichoffer sufficient security for trade.5.      illl nations should undertake to refrain from propaganda subversive of order and the established political system in otnercountries than their own,6.      All countries should join in an under-staking to refrain from aggression again-0their neighbours.&quot;
These decisions which had been reached at Cannes had beenaccepted by the convening Bovernments and implicitly bythe German and Russian Governments when/they/accepted the invitation to Geno&amp;i.     Hs agreed, however that this wasnot sufficient.     It would be necessary to have a clear and definite acceptance of these principles.     The questionnow arose as to the line to be taken by the british Dele-gatioh at Genoa.     The Allied experts had reachei ooq-dit ional &amp;dr referendum conclusions in regard to Russia,including such matters&quot;as the conditions for trade, access to the Courts, the protection and legal status of traders0THB GHAtfGjSLLOii. 0? THiS ^XCHJSQUiSit said that as regard:&apos;the private debts, the Allied experts had recommended,as a condition of recognition, that Russia should agreeto pay debts and compensation.     They had also proposed, the establishment of tribunals.     The arrangements pro-posed for the payment of Allied debts were rather elabor-ate.     The doviet Government had seized a great deal ofprivate property and would, be asked to make arrangementsfor compensation.     Many bonds of the Russian ImperialGovernment were held in Paris and the experts proposedthat the Soviets should be asked to issue new bonds in place of them.TH&amp; PRIMiil MliilSTJSE said he did not even know ifthe Soviets were prepared to discuss such questions.If they could not be induced to accept the necessary con-ditions, the question of recognition could not even beconsidered.      If, however, the Soviet accepted the cannes conditions, the question would arise as to whetherthe British Delegation was precluded from recognisingthem under any circumstances.     Another question was asto whether there should be a probationary period in;order
to establish whether the Russian acceptance was merely a paper acceptance. His view was that the Cannes resolution would give the Allies power to consider the question of recognition and to ? their decision according to the view they formed from the conduct of the Russian delegates as to whether they had practically abandoned Communistie principles in dealing with foreign Powers, or not. There were two parties in Russia, one entirely Communistic, and the other prepared to abandon Communism in dealing with foreign Countries. He did not know which was on top at present. If, however, the latter was in the ascendant, he thought it would be a mistake to send them away with a refusal to do business. In fact, it would be useless to go to Genoa with instructions that in no ? would recognition be granted. He could no undertake to go with these terms after agreeing to the Cannes resolution as a basis for the Genoa Conference. Assuming, therefore , that the Bolshevist Delegates accepted the conditions assuming that the Allies were convinced that they really intended acceptance,and this was largely a question of their ? and the ? they made in the hearing of the world the question would then arise as to whether recognition should be immediate, or for a probationary period. He understood there was a strong feeling among his colleagues and in the House of Commons against recognition. Personally he was prepared to respect the view taken by Several of his colleagues and he was very anxious that they should march together on this question. In fact, he was prepared to meet that view provided he was not asked to go back on something he had already agreed to and which had been allowed to stand as the basis of the Genoa Conference.


It was clear that it was impossible to trade in Russiaunless the traders had some status in the Courts and thesame was true of Russians in Allied countries.      It was even more important and? indeed absolutely essential to trade,to have peace in  iurcpe.     At present there was no peace.It was only necessary to read the Russian wireless newsor tha telegrams from Poland, Roumania, or Finland to seethat their armies were massing.     The Poles were convincedthat the Russians were arming; the Russians were convincedthat the Poles were instigating a rovelution in theircountry;    Roumania was anxious about the position ofBessarabia, and Finland about Karelia.     So long as this wasthe case there could he no trade in Russia, Roumsnia, Czecho-Slovakia, or Finland.- -&quot; A-firm peace was indispensable.Russia must recognise the boundaries of Bessarabia as partof Reumauia.   ;.-.All parties must agree to respect the boun-daries.    ,Otherffise there&apos; would be no trade.      If some suchPact as this were signed, his idea was -  and later he wouldgive a precedent for it-&apos;- that Allied agents, Consuls andso forth should-enter - Russia and that Allied subjectsshould have a status in the Courts.     Similarly, russia should have agents and representatives in Allied countries. -As a matter of fact, they had &quot;trade agents already inGreat Britain-.     Pull dipiemat.ic representation, however,must be.postponed until the Pact was in the main and\ sufc-stsntialiy.; given -effect to so far as Governments are in aposition to control these matters.     Per this suggestion
there was the German precedent. After the signature of the Treaty of Versailles, Germany had for some months been represented in London only by a Charge d&apos;Affaires. Similarly, Great Britain had been represented in Berlin by a Charge d&apos;Affaires. The delay in appointing Ambassadors had perhaps been unduly long but this was due to tne French. It had been postponed until Germany had shown that she was ready to carry out the Treaty. His proposal was to take the Cannes resolutions as the basis, with the commentaries of the Allied Expert Conference, which were not yet available to the Cabinet, to add to this a European Pact of Peace, which would have the effect of guaranteeing peace in Eastern Europe. The full diplomatic recognition of Russia to be postponed until the Allies were satisfied of the bona fides of tne Russian Government. Until that time Russia would be represented only by an unofficial Charge d&apos;Affaires, who would have access to the Foreign Office, but not to the Court. When the Powers were satisfied that Russia was carrying out her engagements, full diplomatic recognition would be given. In reply to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Prime Minister said he thought it would be better not to fix a period for this.


THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER pointed out that M. Poincaré had suggested a period of six months.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR pointed out that some months would be required for the Russians to fulfil the terms of the Cannes resolution to set up Arbitral Courts, etc.

THE MINISTER OF HEALTH raised the question as to whether the Germans had not already recognised the Soviet Republic.

THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that since the murder of a German Ambassador, they had never recognised them.

THE MINISTER OF HEALTH asked how, therefore, the Germans were able to do trade?

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER pointed out that Great Britain had already done £5,000,000 worth of trade with Russia.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLORIES stated that he had raised this question at the Cabinet on 16th December 1921, when the Cabinet had agreed --

(a) "That in the conversations with M. Briand and M. Loucheur the Prime Minister should be perfectly free to examine all aspects of proposals for dealing with the problem of German Reparations and inter-alia a scheme for the formation of a syndicate of the Western Powers (and possibly the United States) for the economic reconstruction of Russia, subject to possible conditions, e.g. recognition of Russian debts, the control of Russian railways and Customs and diplomatic recognition of the Soviet Government;



(b) "That before the diplomatic recognition of the Soviet Government was agreed to, the Cabinet should be consulted, and that in the meantime Ministers were in no way committed

"The Secretary of State for the Colonies wished his view recorded, that while he regarded a tripartite trade agreement is premature at present, he had no objection to it is principle. He dissented, however from any decision being taken at this stage, and in the absence of several colleagues, to accord diplomatic recognition to the Soviet Government."

Then/






xhefi haft followed the Cannes meeting, where theresolutions f-IrOady referred to had teen taken.     The Cabinsjia-a not been consulted in regard to these.     It. was true tha&apos;he himfcolf hqd made no protest at the tine.     Ee had nevercontemplated that the question of his. personal position onthe sub,.eat of the diplomatic recognition of the SovietGovernment could arise in its present form.      In the ordina:.ooiirse of events-, the Prime Minister would have gone to Ceno-to&apos; ai souos the question; there on the basis of the Cannesresolution^     Before a decision had been taken the cabinet would have been consulted.     That would have boon the moment at whi oh anyone who A is agreed with the policy would hatemade his protest.-.   Mow* ho-/ever, it was contemplated topass a;rosolution through Parliament which would commit tothe&apos; discretion of the British Delegates at Genoa the qpes-tiori of the recognition of the Soviet Government.       TheCabinet, tPrefers, were getting no opportunity to givefinal consideration to their decision.     Re could quiteimagine that the house of Commons would give the PrimeMinister and -kiss eb&amp;seague-s full liberty.     lie,, however,would exneet reference &quot;to be made to the Cabinet from Genoabefore final decision Was taken.     It -was not a question ofwant of confidence-;     -He himself had the greatest confidence&quot;in &quot;the Prime Ministert but he knew ^exactly what the primeMinister wished to bring about.     Ee  4&amp;t that the docleljnto pass this resolution &quot;in the House of Com. -,oxis bound theCabinet -in advance without -their having formed their -ownestimate as to -whether the Soviet representatives would carryout their &quot;bargain.     The matterwae -now tr-.nsferr.ea to theHouse of Convene.    -Koierring to the Cannes resolutions,he expressed the gravest doubt as to whether &quot;the Soviet conic.ever;
ever carry out those conditions. Re recalled that at a Conference of Ministers held on 10th February, 1922, the Prime Ministers had stated to Mr. Chamberlain and Lord Curzon that -

"It was his intention to make it clear to M. Krassin that it was not much use the Soviet Government sending representatives to  ?enos unless sending representatives to Denos unless they wore prepared to accept the conditions of January 6th."

At a subsequent interview on the same day whioh the Prime Minister had had with M. Krassin, the latter was reported according to Sir Maurice Eankey&apos;s notes, to have said - 

"The Russian Government regarded the Cannes Clauses as a basis of possible agreement, but if the signature of the Russian Government to the clauses as drafted was demanded as a condition of their attendance at Genoa. the Russian Government would be placed in every difficult position. They regarded the spirit of the conditions as one-sided ..... If the French proposals were adopted that the Russian Government should accept the resolution of January 6th as it stood, his Government would be placed in an extraordinarily difficult position."

"The Prime Minister had said -

"He had always thought that Russia must accept the conditions which were laid down in the Cannes Resolutions.  After all they were only the conditions on which every civilised Government conduct; its affairs ....  He hoped, therefore, that Russia would say definitely that she accepted the Cannes conditions of January 6th and was willing to discuss their application. He bogged that whoever was responsible for the reply would not give a qualifled answer, but would say that he accepted the conditions .... He hoped that the Soviet Government would give a simple answer to the effect that they were willing to the principle of the Resolution of January 6th and to come to Genoa to discuss its application .... Their (the Russian) reply should be to accept the principles of the Cannes Resolution and to state that they were prepared to discuss their application."

M. Krassin had said -

"There were juridical objections to adopting this course.  If they accepted the conditions of January 6th  they would be in the nature of a contract."

"In- reply to a further appeal from the Prime Minister for a simple acceptance of the Cannes Resolution on the lines ho had proposed, M. Krassin had said --

Russia/
"Russia had her own public opinion, which might change, but changed very slowly."

"The Prime Minister had urge strongly that the Russians should adopt the Cannes principles and state that they were ready to discuss their application."



 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COL?INS then read evidence to show that M. Krassin before his meeting with Mr. Lloyd George had informed his Government that the recognition of the Cannes resolution, at any rate in the form in which it was published, could not for one moment be contemplated, and that at that meeting he had warned them in Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s opinion the Soviet Government would have to declare its agreement with the principles formulated at Cannes, and its readiness to discuss its practical application.

  Continuing, he pointed out that on the 13th February 1922, the Prime Minister had stated in the House of Commons that --

 " Russia has accepted the invitation of the Italian Prime Minister. In the invitation sent to Russia, special attention is called to the paragraphs mentioned in the question. An acceptance has been received without any protest or qualification in respect of those paragraphs."

On the 25th February, 1922, the Prime Minister had met M. Poincard at Boulogne. According to Sir Maurice Hankey&apos;s not as, M. Poincard had said -

 "He himself had taken care some days ago to have Mr. Lloyd George informed that, for a month past, The Governemnt of the Republic had been sounded from various very serious quarters, by representatives of the Soviet who wished to engage in conversations in regard to Genoa?, and he was sorry to say that the proposals of the Soviet had been very clearly against Great Britain. If he had ? a selfish and nationalistic impulse to trade, he might have listened to what they had to say. As a matter of fact, however, he had refused absolutely to listen to them."

Later, M. Poincaré had raised the question of the recognition of Soviet Russia.

  

  
?. The Prime Minister referred to the following suggestion contained in a paper which had been sent to him by Dr. Benes -

&apos;In the next place the political conditions for the de jure recognition of Russia would be laid down. The question of actual de jure recognition to remain open and to depend on the results achieved by the Conference.&apos;

This had not been his original idea, but on the whole he rather like it. He did not want the Allies to make up their minds in regard to the recognition of Russia until they had seen how the Russian Delegates behaved at Genos. They might find the Russians were impossible to deal with. If it was found that they insisted on impossible conditions, and that they were people with whom it was impossible to do business, then they would not be recognised. M. Krassin was the only one that he himself had met personally. This led him rather to like Dr. Benes&apos; idea to reserve the grant of de jure recognition until it had been seen how the Russians behaved themselves at Geno, and whether we were satisfied with their bon? fides. France, Italy, Belgium and Great Britain could consider on the basis of the Russian attitude at Genos whether they could be recognised."

M. Poincaré had said -

"He wished to define what Dr. Benes had said more closely. He thought in addition it would be necessary to take further precautions. At Cannes the French Government had reserved to itself the right not in any event to recognise the Soviets de jure. They had said they might, if the Soviet accepted the conditions, but full liberty of action had been reserved to them by the Cannes Agreement."

Thus Mr. Churchill continued, the French claim that even if the Cannes conditions were accepted they were not bound to recognise the Soviet Government, and we were no more bound than France by the Cannes Agreement,

THE PRIME MINISTER said he agreed with this. We had ? right to judge whether the Russians were accepting the condition bone fide.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES continued, that the "Pravda" (the official journal of the Communist Party) had repeatedly made clear that Soviet Russia refused to adhere to the Cannes conditions. He then read an extract for a very remarkable speech made by M. Lenin at the Congress of Metal Workers on the 6th March, 1922, in which he was reported 
: ..... by the Bolshevik if ire less Press to - have spoken as follows :.*&quot;I hope personally to speak to&quot; Lloyd George at genoa, and to toll him. that it&quot; Is not worth whiletrying to frighten ua with trifles *     I hope I.,shall^not bo prevented,from doing so by myillness, which-for.several months post has keptme -from to king a direct part in political affairs,and prevents mo entirely from carrying out. theSoviet duties to which I have been appointed.....1&apos;Later on he declared that -&quot;The most&apos;-&apos;correct definition of the situation from, the point, of view of-..&apos;practice 1 tasks hasbeen made by Comro.dc Trotski , ^rEvery Red Army soldier should be made tounderstand that tho. postponement of the genoa Conference moans the danger of war.ve shall finally make every Red* Armysoldier know this.    In the question ofGo no?) one must differentiate strictlybetween the essentials of the matter andthose press &quot;canards&apos; which are launchedby the Bourgeoisie.   All attempts ,to forceconditions on us as though we were a con-quared notion ore on absurdity-to which Itis not worth while replying.....      Wo can say with complete confidence that the retreatwhich we bejan, can already bo stopped by, us-a nd. is a Iron dy- being stopped.     Enough *   t&apos;oquite clearly she end&apos; do not conceal-that thisis p &apos; -retreat*.   &quot; &quot;.&apos;o advance to positions that wecould (nof?) hold.1    n        ; - \.    :The speech ended with the following:-&quot;Again,^Pnough,&apos; no more concessions-.    If the capitalists think they con delay further,they must be told:     Enough, to--morrow youwill receive nothing.     If the history ofthe victories of.the Soviet Government has-taught them nothing, then they can do cs theyplease.     I hope the Congress will alsoconfirm tho fact that we*&quot;are not going toretreat soy further.   The retreat has &quot;ended.1    &quot;
Mr. Churchill . stated - that. If M - Polocare&apos;s viewof the Cannes Resolutions was taken and compared with theviews expressed by .M. Frossin&quot;,.&apos; it would not be correct tosay that the Cannes Resolutions had been accepted by theRussian Soviets..TP7? PRT^E :.p;lWISTER- pointed&apos; out that&apos; if the view wastaken of v. Lenin&apos;s speech,,thet it was intended that theSoviet ivould not recognise &quot; the&apos;-&apos;Cafthes&apos;&apos; conditions, then thequestion of the recognition of &quot;the&quot;Soviet Government wouldnot arise.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES said thatthis was why he felt the position was so unsatisfactory.The British Government apoeared to be moving from point topoint without ever obtaining a definite answer.Ti-n? PRIME MINISTER said, that If this was the case it was only because of the frightful prospect of interne tic:/trade.    Tn any event these prospects were sufficiently badfor any Government, but they were hopeless unless peace couldbe establisbed in Europe.    His position&apos;was somewhat similarto that of Pitt who,  irr the year 1797, -had adopted almostprecisely the same attitude towards the French Revolutionas he was adopting towards the Russian Soviet:    that is tosay, he hated their doctrines, but thought only of establishingpeace in Europe.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES stated thathe had set forth the..argument summarised above In-order toshoY that the British Governs     t were still uncommitted asregards the recognition of the Russian Soviet.    Now, however,they were going to ask..Parliament- to- pass a resolution whichwould have a binding, effect on themselves. . Er. Bonar Law he &apos;told/
told him thet a 1though he was not taking a strong lineagainst the Genoa Conference, he felt that parliament oughtto be consulted in regard to it-.    He had also felt the sameas regards the granting;of credits, namely, that parliament should first be consulted.. The British Government were nowgoing to pass a resolution through Parliament which wouldhand, over the decision to the British Delegates at Genoa -one of whom at any rate was passion; tely in favour of acertain course,THE PRIMS MINISTER recalled that at Cannes the wholeof the proposals had been telegraphed every day to London.THE MIwiSTii-R OF HEALTH said, he could, not understand why the British Delegates should reach their final decision without consulting the Cabinet.THF.SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES pointed outthat in the House of Commons the Government would be askedwhether the-resolution bound them to recognise the SovietGovernment.THE LORD CHANCELLOR pointed out that certainly it did not.-    Tn any event it was only contemplated to grantsuch, recognition as was- necessary to give effect to theresults of the Genoa: Conference.    If recognition was p-ranted.it was only proposed to allow a Charge d&apos;affaires to beestablished in London.    He thought the House of Commons wouldbe.satisfied with this.,.   THE. MINISTER 0^ HEALTH pointed out that most peoplethought that H. Krassin was already recognised.    The fact thathe dealt with the rjrime. Minister instead of ^he Foreign Officerather had the effect of enhancing his prestige.TV!E LORD PRIVY SEAL said that this  was not. the casein the House of Commons-.who knew the true position.    The momestho i
the flbvernraerit&apos;s resolution was tabled an amendment would beput down raising the question of recognition;    perhaps theycould be anticipated in the Debate by a statement On thelines of the explanation given by ihe Lord Chancellor.   Atpresent there **as a tendency in certain quarters -to weaken the hands of the executive *     The Prime Minister had said tok. Poincare at Pouldgne, that anything he signed at Genoacould only be subject u    confirmation by the House of Commons,-That&apos; made the position quite clear as regards the House ofCommons.&apos;  The Cabinet end House of Commons however were notin quite the same position.rpww pppV:w. MIWTSTER pointed out that the Cabinet wouldbo informed every day from Genoa.    That would be the positionof the Secretariat.   The Cabinet had been kept very fully informed of what had happened at Cannes.TMW SECRETARY. OP STATE FOH THE COLOTEIES said he hadnot realised this.   At any rate, the Cannes Resolutions had v.-been discussed.at a Cabinet vesting.TH&quot; LORD PRIVY SEAL pointed out that the Cabinet hadbeen scattered.TEE FREE ^IFISTEE pointed out that Lord Curzon, whoseview did not differ widely from the Secretary of State for tf/Colonies&apos;, would bo at Genoa.    He was glad to say that theLord Chancellor would pIso be in the neighbourhood and he proposed to take the opportunity to consult him.    It was difficult to take a decision of  this kind in advance.    Itdepended upon the circumstances of&apos; the moment.-   For example,the Soviet Delegates might accept the Cannes WesoluaioxjS, hir&apos;their demeanour might be &quot;so unsatisfactory as to cancel thisout.Tl&apos;r  LORE  PRIVY SEAL pointed out that there was noquestiep/
question of riving unfettered discretion to the british delegates Pt Genoa. - on the contrary, their discretion was limited and. guarded.&apos; -The Prime Minister had said he wouldnot discuss or consider the recognition of the Soviet Govern-ment except on their acceptance of the substance of the cannes conditions.    In addition there had been no questionof full diplomatic recognition, but merely&apos; such limitedrecognition as was required to render business possible.THF SECRETARY OF STATE FOE THE COLONIES said thatthe bond Privy Sea 1&apos;s summary made it easier for him to acceptThe argument he had wished to state was, that to give fullsovereign recognition was to take sides against Russia as awhole in favour of a band of dastardly criminals.   That weshould give independent recognition was out of the question*THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said, the main object was toavoid disagreement while the. British representatives were at Genoa-,   &quot;it Was important to define the limits of theirauthor ity..THE PRIME MINISTER said that in any event they wouldnot grant full diplomatic recognition.   They would wait untilthe Soviet Government had proved their bone fides.    He pro-posed that the Cabinet A-astlng, vvhlch had been fixed for11..30 the following day, should be postponed until noon, andthat -the lord Privy Seal., the Lord Chancellor, the Secretaryof ?tete for foreign Affairs, Sir Eyre Crowe and himself shoumeet at 12 noon to draft a formula relating to the limitedrecognition contemplated,. rTh1.&apos;s&apos; was agreed to.,THE LORD PRIVY SEAL asked whether the proposedNon-Aggressi,.
TJon-Aggres-slon -Treaty would be free - from any guarantee ofthe territories - of countries in Eastern Europe?THE&apos; PRIME MINISTER said, there would be no guarantee of any kind.T&quot;T; LORE PRIVY SEAL then asked if it was clearthere would be no guarantee 6f any Government loan for any foreign exchequer.TT&quot; SECRETARY OE STAT&quot;:&quot;  &quot;&apos;0E rAR said, that no such proposal had ever been considered..T&quot;1&apos;&quot; SECRET.&apos;1.rfY 0r STAE&apos;&quot;&apos; r-Qfj THE COLJPIES sr. id, he presumed that the Cabinet could reserve discretion of judgmein regard -to the conditions if they were not carried out ina manner which they felt they could agree to.TEE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the Prime:Ministerrealised that the Cabinet were very stiff about the conditiowhich had been laid down.    He then read the &quot;followingresolution for submission to Parliament, which he had drafte&quot;That this House approves the resolution passed by the Supreme Council at Cannes as thebasis of the Genoa Conference and will supportRis- Ma&apos;j3sty&apos;*s Government in giving effect tothem.&quot;It was agreed to submit this to the Cabinet..2, Whitehall Hardens, S.&apos;&apos;\l.28th Nrch,  1922.

His suggestion was that there should be merelya Charge d*affaires in London and Moscow, if it was found possible to recognise.     Pull diplomatic ee eogniManrepresentation would have to come later according to theway the Soviet Government carried out the terms of their agreement.    It would first be necessary at Genoa todecide whether it was possible to clo business with theSoviet representatives at all.   He hoped, however, thatthe/
the British Delegates would have freedom to go ahead tothe extent he had indicated,THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said there were three stages:-(I) The Cannes Resolutions must be accepted bythe Soviet Representatives.(2) If they accepted, the Allied representatives would have to judge from their demeanourand general attitude as to whether they were acting bona fide.EE-&apos; ERE.; Eg --g      ,&apos;v.-.Eg&apos;/..v .(&apos;&amp;) If they came to the conclusions that theywere acting bona fide, then they could goas far as to agree to representation by aoharge d*affaires.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said he understood the proposal, but he was not sure it would work out that way.     It was true that after the signatureH the Treaty of Versailles the British Government had appointed a Charge d&apos;affaires, Lord Kilmaroocks in Berlin,and the Cermans had appointed one In London.     Thisarrangement had lasted for five or six months.     Thiswas a lower phase of diplomatic recognition.     His idea was not to give recognition.     His main idea, however,was that on no account should the British government act alone in this matter,.THE PRIME MIBISTER said he entirely agreed inthis,latter suggestion.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said it would be fatal if the British Government acted alone.THE PRIME MINISTER said they would not recognisealone but it would not be advisable to say this in public at present./THE
THE SEUHETiEY.  OF.STATE F R FOREIGI, AFFAIRS&apos; said thatin Paris U. poincare had told him th&amp;t ho was not coming to Genoa at the outset but would send some other Minister.The reasons for not coming had been somewhat lame.    He said he could not be absent from Paris when-the president was -on his tour irl Africa.     He himself .and A. Schanzer had thenpleaded with 1 . Poincare&apos;&apos;.   A little later      &quot;polneare had again rev er tea to the question, and had - as Iced what arrangement would be made if a Prime minister turned up at some later stage in the Conference,   would It be necessary, he asked, -to turn out some other nelcgateV   Lord Curzon had repliedthat there were no rules in auoh matters.   In effect anyPrime Minister or for the matter of that, any Foreignminister, could always be brought into the Conference.This incident, however, snowed that A.. Poincare was a littleanxious lest a bad impression .should be created in Franceby his absence from Genoa.     As a-on as he had satisfied,the French chauvinists by not a- tending at the outset, hewould probably repair to Genoa. ,,   A. Sehanzer had said that It would be lucky if theconference was completed in two months.   A. Poincare had said six months, but had been talking in a derisory manner *XKm Schanzer&apos;s idea of for ming Commit toes at once did&quot; notappeal to him (Lord Curzon).    The - Russian and GermanRepresentatives would certainly wish to speak at the outset.Sir Maurice nan key had told Aim that there Was some ideaof malting epooches outlining the scope of the ConferenceC*v,aewl proposing the Chairman.    In any speech he made the french representative would at once ask if the Cannes conditions-were accepted.   .There would probably then follow a longwrangle which would occupy same time.       Dr. Benes and theRussian and German Representatives would certainly wishto/
to speak.    Then would follow a discussion of ti.e. CannesBosolutions.   Probably the Committees would not start .work under a fortnight.   Then and not until then would*the question of recognition arise.   Then would be themoment to secure, if not unanimity, at any rate a generalmeasure of agreement on the subject.THE PRIME MIKISTJ5R and TEC LORD   PRIVY SEAL agreed.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL thought it was probable thatthe Russians would . off er some sort of . acceptance of the cannes Resolutions.The Conference of Ministers on the    previous eveninghad been very firm on the necessity for standing by thefull terms of the Cannes Resolutions.    If these weresecured then they would have to be worked out in detail,THE PRIMS lililI ST EE said he agreed generally withthe Secretary of state for Foreign Affairs.   Supposingthe Russians were to say that they accepted the CannesResolutions in principle and were then to advance counterclaims, he himself would be inclined to suggest the question being referred to a Committee.    The plans worked out by theAllied Experts might then be handed to the Russians.   ThisCommittee, he thought, would have to be a political Committee,but the details were of vital importance.    It would benecessary to ascertain, for instance, exactly what theRussians meant when they accepted the payment of debts.Would thoy give bonds as regards the Railways?    would theyrestore the&apos; factories?&apos;   All this would have to bo gone into in detail.   Possibly the Chancellor of the Exchequermight be the most suitable person for such a Committee.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said ho didnot v;ish to be on such a Committee *
THE LORa PRIVY SEAL again adverted to the impossibilityo 1* t sic ing any isol ateu aeti on *SHJS  HI ME iillHISTER agreed, but said it would be inadvisable to advei-tise the fact as the Breech would take advantage of it.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that on the assumption thatthe Russians accepted tie Cannes Resolutions the question wealdarise of some sort of recognition.1!sia PRIME MI;:130EE pointed out that some status in theCourts of Raw would be essential .TBS SECRETARY OP 3TAP Hi PGR FOREIErM AFFAIRS pointed outthat even a qualified recognition would amount to de jure recognition.THE LORD CHANCELLOR agreed that technically this was correct.   The writers on international law, however, alwaysspoke of de jure recognition as the full admission to thecomity of nations.    A country which had in former circumstances had an Ambassador, would hardly be admitted to the comity ofnations if only allowed to have a Charge d&apos;affaires.THE SECRETARY OF SilEAPS FOR FOREIGiJ iF.F4l.h3   pointed outthat the Representative would have access to the ForeignOffice.    Tho main difference weald be that he would not goto Court.THE PRIME MINISTER read an extract from a letter whichhad been communicated to him by the Rome Secretary, indicating that M. Lenin was abandoning his communistic principles.   Ifthis were the case by recognising him we should, be supportingthose in Russia who were in favour of moderation.   He did not contemplate ceremonial recognition.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said that a charge d * affaires would go to Court, although he would not bereceived individually by the Sing.m LTV- /
THE PRIME MINISTER said that Sir Eyre Crowe on the previous say had spoken to him of an unofficial Charge d&apos;affairs. 

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS pointed out that at the present moment in Greece, the British

 Government had a  Minister who did not go to Court because we did not recognise the king.

THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that the present arrangement under Which M. Krassin, when dealing with matters which were outside the scope of the Board of Trade, referred not to the foreign Office but to the Prime Minister himself, was very inconvenient.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS at this point received particulars of the precedent of the German Ambassador. The Treaty of Versailles had been ratified on January 10th, 1920. On the same day Lord Kilmarnock had been appointed Charge d&apos;affaires at Berlin. On June 29th he had been replaced  by Lord d&apos;Abernon as Ambassador. On January 20th M. Sthamer had been appointed Charge d&apos;affaires, and on October 14t he had been appointed German Ambassador in London.
LOAD CURSOH thon postulated tho oaso whether the genoa Conference, might last longer than was originally- anticipated.     Ke understood that the Prime Minister might be. able to -stay, away for a month, as a&quot; maximum.      it waspossible that at the time of tho prime Minister1 s return,   .the position might not .bo-&apos; sufficiently, clear to take final conclusions.     On his. return Parliament would probably askto. what extent he proppsef- to. recognise the Bolshevists.    Insuch an event would it not strengthen his. hands to be ableto state his posit ion clearly to Parliament.-   THE PRliiS MIAISTER recalled that he had/to roturrtfrom tho Paris Peace Conference once or twice in order toexplain the position to. Parliament.     Ho would have to judgewhat tho position was in consultation with Lord Ourzon andSir Robert Homo.     He hoped that the Lord Chancellor Wouldalso be there for consultation.     He agreed that it-was possibio he might have to return as the Soorotary of State for   .Foreign Affairs had suggested, but he did not want the Delegation to be tied.      The conditions which would be asked ofRussia wore necessary,  but somewhat humiliating.     They might ask at the outset   &quot;If we do all this shall we have some sort of recognition?&quot;     It might be necessary to give -the soviet representatives some idea of the extent of the recognitionthey might get before progress could be made *     On tho colleagues-:tion of the time the Conference was likely to take, ho -agreedit might last longer than h-..d been estimated. A- Such subjects.as financial,  economic,  and transport questions might take some -time.,  :.nd during the tcohnicul phases of these -perhaps the Chancellor of the Exchequer, or if he. could not remain the Secretary of St:.to for- &quot;it r,  might take charge.      Eohimself and the Foreign Secretary mir:ht then return at theJL cv&quot;t or stuf;&apos;0* ...THE LORD PRIVY SEAL/
THE LORD PRIVY SEAL asked that the situation at home should not be lost sight of. The Prime Minister, the Lord Chancellor, the Foreign Secretary, and the Chancellor of  the Exchequer would all be away. It was indispensable that the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer should be back when the Budget was discussed.

 THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that in that event the Secretary of State for War might carry on at Genoa for a week or ten days.

 THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that this would depend on how far the Chancellor of the Exchequer felt he could hand over his responsibility at Genoa to the Secretary of State for War.

That interval is one which is usually established in; the case of peace between nations&quot;.A-few minutes before, he had shown the whole of the extract he now- read to the Conference, to i5-r. Churchill,who had called on him in connection with Irish business.The Secretary oi&apos; State for the Colonies had said thatthis was a very fair interpretation oi&quot; what the cabinet decided.     He had also shown it to Sir Cecil Hurst, andat his suggestion he had altered the last sentence toshow that the interval was &quot;usually&quot;and not &quot;invariably&quot;established.The lord *rivy Seal urged that the Prime minister should include in his statement that the Soviet Delegateswould not be received at, Court.     He himself was particu-larly anxious that there should be no ambiguity on thesubject, in order that difficulties might not arisewhile the Prime Minister and his colleagues were at
Gen oa.Lord Birkenhead urged that the Prime Minister shouldnot be asked to mention in his speech that the Soviet repre-sentative would not he received at Court.      If the question were raised in debate, &amp;r*Chamberlain would be able to statethis and could, no doubt, do so inoffensively by suggesting that the time would come when the representative could bereceived at Court.Mr.Chamberlain said he thought the House of Commonsmight be very Insistent on this point and heflfherefore felt it would be better that it should come from the Prime minister himself.Sir Cecil Hurst said that although the German Charged*Affaires had not bee received personally by the King, he had,in fact, been invited to Court functions?difference wasThe Prime Minister said a slight/eonteiapl&amp;ted in thepresent casesLord Birkenhead repeated his opposition to the PrimeMinister&apos;s. stating i$ in his original- speech$LgJz, fiL. ^\M^su^-a The Prime Minister thought it would be somewhat awkwardto state it categorically in his statement-in-chief, when hehad to meet the Sovier representatives eo sooii.      He did not want to &quot;rub it in&quot; too much immediately before meeting them.He then read an extract from a recent speech by M*Lenin, whichhe intended to yuote in his statement in the House of commons the following afternoon, which was to the effect that there was -no doubt that the Communists had received a severe economicdefeat and in which the admission was made that, having set out to base their system on government by the proletariat, the &apos;exercise of   Communism in Kussia had resulted from, the dis-appearance of the proletariat in the towns in order to search for work and food in the villages.
