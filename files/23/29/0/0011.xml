(1)     With reference to Cabinet 9 (22), conclusion, the Cabinet resumed their dfsoussion on defence aspectsof the Report of the Committee on National Expenditure.Two documents were circulated afe   the outset of themeeting summarising the results of the enquiries in regardto the dispute as to facts and figures between the Geddes&apos;Committee and the Admiralty and War Office respectively(Papers CP.-3751 and CP. 3752).(2)     THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER gave the cabinet a summary of the first of these documents (Paper C-.P.3751).In regard to the Admiralty figures he drew particular attention to the contrast between the large proportionof men provided now, as compared with pre-war, for ships other than ships of the line, and to the numbers with-drawn from the Fleet for training, for whose replacementduring their period of training, substitutes were provided.THE PRIME MINISTER felt that a detailed discussion on figures at this stage would lead to ho result.     Havingregard to the fact that there was no difference in regardto the number of capital ships to be maintained, and tothe remoteness of any immediate propspect of a naval war,he made, on behalf of the Cabinet, an appeal to theAdmiralty to make a further attempt to reduce the personnel of the Fleet during the next, two critical years, when tradewas likely to be bad and revenue correspondingly reduced.In doing this he invited the Admiralty to put forwardalternative proposals stating exacting what risks wouldbe Involved by their adoption, and bearing In mind thatthe risks would be of a temporary character.     It wouldbe for the Cabinet to decide whether these risks shouldbe taken or not.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY, while emphasising the great reductions already effected by the Admiralty,undertook to make a fresh examination of the question.He mentioned, however, that he would be unable to report
ji 134until after th^-r^turn on the 80th Instant of the first sea Lord, who was ahs-eri^-abroad^ on^tn^^The suggestion was made that It would be a highlyuneconomical proceeding to dismiss trained men today andto start training boys to replace them in two years&apos; time,mr PATpot.tr., asked by the Prime Minister to give hi3 viewson the naval situation in view of his recent study of thisquestion at Washington, pointed out that the country was bound to be in some peril during the next two years, and hadto choose between Scylla and Charybdls, between a naval periland a financial peril. The Cabinet and the House of commons had to choose between these risks.   He would state theposition frankly to Parliament.   He would not ask theAdmiralty to maintain that the position of the Fleet was satisfactory when it was not satisfactory.   He would inform parliament that the Government were not satisfied with theprovisions for the Fleet as now proposed as a permanentestablishment, ard that, sooner or later they would have toask for an lncr*sea.   But, for the moment, they regarded thenaval risk as less serioxis than the financial risk, and inthe Interests of the country it was necessary temporarily toreduce the Navy.
0, 135EXPEN- (5) THB-3T3CBKTARY (5F STAT^ FOR WAP-observation-erved that mr balfour&apos;s remarks regarding the naval risk applied, equally to the War Office.   He called the attention of the Cabinetto tho General Staff Memorandum which was printed in appendix ii to the Report of Mr Churchill&apos;s Committee.   He warned the   -Cabinet that our liabilities abroad were such that it was notpossible, without grave risk, to reduce the fighting   strengthof the Army.   He had found that certain administrative econ-omies were possible, and these he was giving effect to, butit was for the Cabinet to decide whether, having regard to theeconomic   position of the country, financial risks greaterthan the military ris&amp;3 would be run if reductions in thefighting strength o*&quot; the Army were not made.   In layingsketch Estimates for 1922-83 before the Geddes Committee, hehad made all the adm.inistra.tive reductions possible, amountingto -&quot;rom  4,000,^00 to  5,000,00?.   The Geddes Committee had recommended, in addition, a cut of  20,000,000.   If the cabinet decided to take the military risks indicated by the GeneralStaff, he could produce&apos;further economf-s of  16,500,000, ascompared with the  20,CO0,OOC proposed by the G?ddes Committee,He included in the  16,500,000 the German contribution towardstvo cost of the Rhine Army, which was not now credited to Armyfunds,   ^e G^dd^s Oowittew had stated that the Army was^,000 ren in excess of requirements.    He disagreed with thestandard fixed and the calculations m^de by the Geddes Cor-mittee.   He did not propose, however, to argue the matter.The Treasury and war Office representatives, who, in accordancewith a sufff-astion mnde at the last Cabinet Meeting, had dis-cussed the question, agreed that 40,000 should be substitutedfor the figure 54s000 put forward by the Geddes Committee.His proposals now were to make a reduction of 33,000 men inthe Army.   If the r-duction was increased to 40,000 men itwould involve the abolition of the cadres of 4 Battalions of infantry        3 Brigades of Artillery, and would result inR&apos;sn-.-1.ns of about  1,000,000 to  1,500,000,He wtirn-d the
Cabinet that his saving of  16,560,300 was based on certain assumptions that might not be fulfilled.   These w-.ro:-(n) Jbat Increases in the non-effective chargesdu** to pensions or other compensatior neces-; by compulBory retirements, about 2,600,000, ar* borne on a separate Vote.(b) That the rates of wages and course of prices,and that the Indian and German Exchange, areas stated in Section S of War Office Notessubmitted to Mr Churchill&apos;s Cormittee.(c) That after April 1022    in Palestine, and october, 1922, in Irac, all British army personnel will be withdrawn from those.areas.(d) That the Admiralty place orders to the valueof  900,000 with Woolwich. &apos;With regard to the last point, he explained that he was budget-ing for a reduction of the men at Woolwich from 10,000 to,000, and it must be realised that even that reduction would*M to anneals to the Government to give work to the Arsenal.His proposals included a reduction of the Votes for the T^rri-torial Army by  1,75$,000, which Involved     reductions of establishment and of the Boxinties and Allowances, which wouldbe very unpopular in the House of Commons.   To sum up, theArmy Estimates for 1921-22 stood at  75,$00,000, and the sketch Estimates submitted to the Geddes Committee f*r1931-22 stood at  64,000,000.   He now proposed that theEstimates should be fixed at  53,500,0*0, with  7,000,Otf*for the Middle East, making a total of  60,5C0,000.   that figure would be. reduced to  59,000,003 if the Army wascredited with the  1,510,000 recovered from Germany for thecost o** tho Army of Occupation.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR INDIA observed that he did not understand why the Secretary o^ State for 7!ar assumed that therupee should be taken at ls.6d.   In their budget the Govern-ment of India had taken it at ls.Ad. because they thoughtit was not likely to go higher.   He suggested that theSecretary of State for War should take the same figure.THE. SECRETARY OF STATE ?GR W/R replied that he was qUitewilling to take that risk. &apos;.-4-
THE&quot; PRTMFPMI^^ it wasonly reasonable that, the War Office should be or^di^tedr-wlJKh-the sum to be recovered from Germany, as the force on the rhine was, an additional obligation upon the War Office.He made the same appeal to the Secretary of State for war as he had made to the Admiralty,,   He ashed him to endeavourto reduce the Estimates, recognising that certain militaryrisks would have to be incurred for the next two years.THE LORD PRivY SEAL reminded the Cabinet that we neednot now contemplate fighting an European enemy equipped withall the latest mechanical appliances for war0   We should nowvisualise a situation in which we might have to fightIndians and Arabs *   That involved military operations of avery different class.   He suggested that the military organ-ieation for such Operations might be simplified, and that no serious risk would be incurred by cutting off the ancillary services to form part of the higher tactical formations.
i. *jt 5bP services common TO,&apos;UAvY, ARMYAND AIR FORCE.Appointmentbf Committee,(4)        In the course of the discussion the suggestion wasmade that there was a serious excess of expenditure owingto the maintenance of the triplicate administrative^services by the Wavy, Army and Air Force, both at home andabroad, such as Chaplains, Medical, Supply and IntelligenceServices, including separate Air Attaches.     It was also pointed out that the staffs at the War Office and admiralty had Increased enormously as compared with the numbers beforethe War.     Attention was also called to the fact that many appointments were not? held by officers of higher rankthan those who had held them before the War.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES pointed outthat his Committee,had recommended that a Technical Committeeof the Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial defence should be appointed immediately to make definite proposalsfor amalgamating aa far as possible the common Services ofthe Navy, Army and Air Force, such aa the Supply, Transport,Education, Medical and Chaplains departments.     He pointedout that an exhaustive enquiry by such a Committee wouldtake six or seven months, so that no results could beexpected from it in connection with the Estimates for 1922-23; but he considered it desirable that the Committeeshould at once be appointed.The Cabinet agreed:-That a Technical Committee should be set up at once to make definite proposals foramalgamating as far as possible the common services of the Navy, Army and Air Force,such aa Intelligence, Supply, Transport,Education, Medical, Chaplains, and any otheroverlapping Departments, in order to reducethe cost of the present triplication.   TheCommittee should consider each branclaseparately and submit Interim reports to the Cabinet as soon as possible.
i1 .     &quot;     &apos;    1 -139AIR FXFENDI-       (5) THE PRINF MINISTER stated that he did not proposeTURE.at the present moment to examine the Air Estimates indetail, hut he made an appeal to the Secretary of Statefor Air similar to the appeal that he had made to theFirst Lord of the Admiralty and the Secretary of Statefor War, again to scrutinise carefully the Air estimates and ss&quot; what additional savings he would be able ta--e?.feet,even if certain risks were involved.-7-
BUt^T FOR (6)    THE CHANCELLOR OF THE&quot; EXCHTKTOER informed the1922-23.&quot;Cabinet, that he had again gone into the figures for nextyear*s Budget, and, assuming an optimistic estimate ofthe revenue and that expenditure was cut down, there wouldbe a deficit of  51,000,000 after the  75,000,000 economiesproposed by the Departments had been taken into considers-tiort;   Bearing in Bind that he could not hope to realise the full amounts of the economies proposed by the GeddosCommittee next year, even if the Government adopted themen bloc. It was doubtful if a further reduction of 51,000,000 would be effected next year.   It was desirablet&amp;at further savings than those now in sight should be madeiin order to enable some reduction of taxation to be made,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR pointed out that the savings proposed by him would be effected in the next year,subject to the understanding that the increases in non-effective charges due to compulsory retirements, etc., wereborne on a separate Vote.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,February 17, 1922.
