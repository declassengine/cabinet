slSVlSIOH Of (l)TES SE0H3TASY OF STATE FOR FCRJBIGB AFFAIRS informeTHE TREATY -   .OF SBYHBS.        the Cabinet that he had Been M. Poincare in Paris onthe l&amp;tb January and had discussed with him the eastern question and Tangier.It will be remembered that before the proceedings at Cannes it had been arranged that the next stop tohe taken In regard to tho Eastern question was a dis-eusaion between the three Foroign Ministers, and after they had agreed upon the terms for a settlement, aconference was to bo held probably at Constantinopleat which the terms would bo laid before the greeks and the Turks who would bo told that these wore thefinal prapesalB of the Alllos.     He had sent a nemoran-dum to the French Government embodying our views asa basis for discussion.    M. Briend had approved of our proposals In principle.   The Italian Foreign minister was also favour able to our proposals.   The fall ofM. Briand&apos;s Government had made a change.   He (LordCur son) had informed M. Poincare&apos; of the position and had offered to place himself at his disposal to continuethe discussions as soon as convenient to him.   M.Poincare had Indicated that the situation had changed.He was opposed to the settlement of Internationalmatters by means of oonferonoos of Prime Ministers.He preferred to revert to the normal diplomaticprooefaro.   As Britain had submitted for proposals,he desired that an opportunity should similarly haafforded to him of expressing the views of the FrenchGovernment,     The Italian Government might wish to dothe same.   Lord Curzon had explained to M.Polncaro&apos;that time was a prime factor.-   1   - i
If we delayed we should lose the favourable opportunityafforded by the suspension of hostilities during thewin tor season of pressing our views upon the Turks andGreeks,   If a settlement was delayed until hostilitieswere resumed it was Impossible to say what might happen.Ha had however informed M. Foinoaro&apos; that he was ready toconsider any proposals that he might submit.   His presentview was that the proper courao was to await the proposalsof the Prenoh Government, with the object of expediting the negotiations to make no reply to them beyond propos-ing to resume the discussions in Paris.   He had explained to M* poincare&apos; that the three Powers mast  first acmeto an agreement as to the terms to be offered and as tothe action to be taken if their advieo was disregarded.In rogm&amp; to this M. poincare had stated that france would not in any circumstances use eoeroive measures against the Sharks,     80 long as Cons tan tine remainedKing of Greooe and Goun arts, Prime Ministert france would show Qreeoe no consideration.     In connectionwith M. poincare&apos;&apos;e Objeotion to the re-assembly of theSupreme Council9 Lord Ourzon had pointed out to him that isfcat was now required was that a new treaty shouldbo drawn up to replace the Treaty of Sevres,   that treaty had been drawn up by the Supreme OouaGil andit could only be replaced by a similar instrumentdrawn up by the same parties and pro son ted in the same way.    It was not a question of &quot;proposing mediation
betwnsm the Greeks and the Turks *   He was inclined to t&amp;isak that Mo Poixicare desired to keep the deoisionopen and to drag out the negotiations until the Springcocifes   sad the forks are able to restart the offensivetheagainst the Greeks, In/expectation that the latter would then be he aten.It was generally agreed that the proposal of theSecretary of State fear foreign iff airs, that on receiptof the Jrenca note he should offer to go to Pavis tos-Qsume negotiations uith the Fraeauh sad italian foreign Ministers, w the best course *
%    AKGIO-FTcBBGE     fs)      The Prime Minister referred to the oonversationRELATIONS,which ho had had with Mi Poincare at Paris on the(OiP.3612).14th January, a note of whioh Is given in CP.3618He pointed out that M. Polnoara had been careful tosay that the views he hed asproaeed wero hie canpersonal views and that he had not then hod enopportunity of meeting his Cabinet;   it was therefore necessary to await his declaration oif policy onbehalf of the Prenoh Government, ^hloh would be made onthe 19th January.The vio*v &apos;vas expressed that it night be well forus to take no further steps at present as regards the angle-French pact, but to let the next step oome fromthe Frencha     In their present hostile attitudetowards us it did not seem to be desirable that weshould take the initiative.    After some weeks have elapsed fead the French began to feel themselves isolatedin Europe and began, to roaliso that we did not regard the pact as of supreme importance to ourselves,it was likely that they would opproadfc us in a mores?eosems&amp;&amp;3 frame of mind.The question was raised as to what would happen if negotiations woro thus suspended.     It wassuggested that franco night immediately marchangles into the Bohr Basin or that she nightannounce her Intention of going so and invite usto Join.    It would then be open to us to withdrawout troops from the Rhine and to withdraw from theSeparations Commieaion.    It was pointed out, onthe other hand, that the occupation of the RuhrBasin under the Treaty of Versailles could only beundertaken in the event of default by Germany, and   4   **
suoh default oo-uld not ooeur before the end ofMarch.She terms in which the Prime Minister had addressed lie poincare (0*?. 3612) were generally approved, and it was generally agreed that thewisest oourse would be, for the moment, to take no further aotioa as regards the pact.
1 91 o(3)    THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR.  FORJSIGH affairs explained to the Cabinet that when the Anglo-Frenchpact was originally being drafted, a clause had been inserted with reference to Belgium, which providedthat Prance and Britain ahould consult and concertmeasures for her protection in time of need.   Belgiumhad been hurt at being disposed of in a olause of theAnglo-French Agreement and had expressed the view thatif we guaranteed the frontier of Prance we should give a similar guarantee as regards the Belgianfrontier which was even more exposed to the risk ofa German incursion than that of Prance.   We had de-clined to meet a Bimilar request two years agobecause Belgium had then refused to give a pledge of neutrality, on the ground of the unpopularity of theexpression in that country.   In order to get over this difficulty at Cannes, he had drawn up a form of words which Belgium had now accepted.   The terms ofthe guarantee are given in CP. 3615.   The questionnow arose as to whether the treaty should now be signedirrespective of the pact with Prance.   It would benatural to connect the two treaties and treat the&quot;Shele frontier as one.   He had informed Belgium thathe would give no deofcaion with regard to the treatywithout a decision of the Cabinet.   The BelgianGovernment had, however, tried somewhat unfairlyto force our hands by publishing the draft as theirown work and by claiming that they had achieved a diplomatic triumph.   He was informed by our ambassador at Brussels, however, that the Belgian press wasindifferent to the treaty   and the comments on itwere far from enthusiastic.   Further, if we were todeal with the Belgian treaty separately, Prancemight regard it as a slight.   On the other hanC ifwe/
i14we signed the Treaty now it might have the effect of leading Prance to a more favourable state, of mind asregards the Anglo-French Agreement.   Secondly though theHouse of Commons was suspicious of such guarantees,a treaty submitted to it in regard to Belgium alone wouldprobably be more acceptable than a treaty in regard toFrance.   Moreover, Belgium having published the treaty would complain that they had been put in a falseposition if ve deferred dealing with it.It was pointed out that France was showing a disposition to treat Belgium as a French protectorate.That attitude was being more and more resented by the belgians, especially the Flemish section of the popu-iation.   The signing of the treaty would encourage the idea of tie independence of Belgium, and asBelgium was willing to accept Great Britain&apos;s wordwithout a military convention, which France insisted was essential to an Anglo-French treaty, certain tacticaladvantages would be gained in the dealings of the nextfew months if It were known that Belgium had acceptedan undertaking which France had declined.   The Anglo-Belgian Agreement had been started as a, separate trans-action, and the pre-war agreement was a separate one.The Cabinet agreed-(l) That the Anglo-Belgian treaty should be proceeded with, subjectto the addition of a clause,giving to the Dominions the option of participating as in the draftAnglo-French Treaty.(2) That the Secretary of State forthe Colonies should communicate with the Dominions on thesubject.
1 ^13TANGIER. (4)     THE SECRETARY OF STATE EOR FOREIGN affairs stated that he had persuaded M. Briand to agree toa conference &quot;being held between   France, Spain and england to deal with the Tangier question.   K.Bratnd had undertaken to he present at the conferencehimself,   if. Poincare&apos; had agreed to the holding ofthe conference; he would not attend himself, hutwould aend a representative to London.
(.5)      THE SECRETARY 03? STATIC F0H1   FOREIGl?AFFAIRS referred to the memorandum which he hadoirculated on this subject (CJ?.-3616).    in substance he sought the authority of the Cabinetto sanction the proposals nor.&apos; put forward byLord Allenby.    He reminded the Cabinet thatwhen the question was under discussion at theend of last year, Lord Allenby had given troassurances, firstly that he could commandsufficient military and naval strength to pre-vent a general rising and to get rid of    ;ghlulPasha if a favourable opportunity offered, and secondly that he would be able to find an egyptian Ministry willing to take office underthe conditions laid down in his letter to the sultan.   His first assurance had proved to bewell founded, but the second had not.   SinceAdly Pasha had resigned there had been noEgyptian Government and the country had been administered under martial law by the BritishUnder-Secretaries in the various departments.During that time Lord Allenby had been carryingon negotiations with Adly Sarwat and others, andhe now put forward proposals with the object ofobtaining an Egyptian Government.   Lord Allenby new that His Majesty&apos;s Government was pledged to make no change in the status Of Egypt withoutthe approval of Parliament.Accordingly he new proposed :-(a) That we should implement the first cbndition of our proposed treaty by pro-posing to parliament thetermination/
termination of the ProtectorateanV. the recognition of Egyptas a Sovereign State.(b)    That we should accept, also as proposed in our treaty, the revival of the EgyptianMinistry for Foreign Affairs.(o)   That we should favour theelection of a nativeParliament - also a point which we had no reason tocontest:(d)    That we should agree to theabolition of martial law -as to which we had long agodeclared our willingness toact at any time on the advice of the High commissioners in his telegram jtfo. 19 of 12th January, lord allenby submitted a draft of a letter which he proposed to submit to the Sultan.   He was con-confident that he could persuade a native Ministryunder Sarwat pasha to take office on the   thegeneral conditions there laid down, and
he proposed that, the discuss ion of a detailed agreement should then be resumed with him much in the same way as4lth Adly Pasha last year.   Fotir main points were reservedfor discussion viz:-(a) Security of communications of British Empire.(b) Defence of Egypt against all foreign aggressionor interference, direct or indirect.(c) Protection of foreign interests in Egypt and protection of minorities.(d) The Sudan.Lord Alleriby had apparently explained to Sarwat that a discussion on those four points must proceed upon the basisof the proposals we had made to Adly.   It wotxld be seenthat Lord Allenby&apos;s proposals were approved by nil theEgyptian authoritieseLOHD CTJR20N read to the Cabinet Lord Allenby&apos; a telegramWoe18 of the 12th January explaining his proposals.   he asked the Cabinet to consider the position in which wewere placed.   Here appeared to be a last chance ofestablishing an Egyptian Ministry.   The proposals had come from our High Commissioner in Egypt and were supportedby nil his advisers4     They further had the support ofall the Egyptian Experts in the Foreign Office.     Therewrjs a certain risk that if the Protectorate were withdrawnbefore the treaty were made the Ministers might claim that Egypt was an independent state and might refuse to cometo terms upon the reserved subjectsj but so long as wemaintained troops in Egypt he did not regard that dangeras serious.   He re com ended the Cabinet to approveLord Allenby*s letter to the Sultan, subject to theprovision that it mist be made clear to Egypt that adiscuss ion of the four reserved points must proceed onthe basis of the proposals we had made to Adly last summero/it was
It was pointed out that whereas we had previously proposed that prior to the abolition of the Protectoratewe should make with Egypt a treaty which would give usa solid position and substantial advantages in thatcountry it was now proposed that we should give up the protectorate in order to induce Sarwat to form aMinistry.   &quot;hen that had been done he ^ight claim thathe was the Minister of an independent country, and,having divested ourselves of our juvldi cal title in thecountry, nothing would remain to us but to use military force.    It was suggested that there was no necessity tobring negotiations to an immediate conclusion.   Owingto a firm handling of the situation by Lord Allenby theprevious decision of the Cabinet had been accepted without serious resistance, and it was reasonable toassume that by a similar display of firmness we couldcontrol any situation that might arise in the future.The suggestion that we should abolish the Protectoratebefore a treaty was made was in effect to concedeto Egypt what we declined to grant to Sinn Fein.   Therewas gra^e danger of leaving the reserved questions inthe air, especially in view of the fact that in thepreviotis negotiations in regard to them ,-&apos;e had failed toreach an agreement.On the other hand it *?as suggested that the calmnessof the country was due to the knowledge that negotiations were in progress.   The present method of administering the country could not be continued indefinitely, andthere was a real danger of a breakdown of the administra-tion through a general strike and the refusal of the egyptians to co-operate with iis.    It was suggested that paragraph 10 of the proposed letter to the Sultan mightbe amended in order to provide that a satisfactory agreement in regard to the four reserved/points
points must preoedo the abolition of the protectorate and the recognition of Egypt as an independent sovereign state.      It was pointed out that Franca and Italy hadnot yet given their approval to the Protectorate, andafter ourselves they are tha powers most interested inEgypt.     Evan if the protectorate were abolished we shouldnot revert to the pro-war pos it ion.     The war and thepublication of Lord milner^s Roport had fundamentallyaltered the position in Egypt.     It was desirable thatwo should obtain the co-operation of the Egyptians in theGovernment of the country.It was generally recognissd that tho questioninvolved a decision which might gravely affact theinterests fo tho British Empiro, and there was a general feeling that the Cabinet had not then at its disposalsufficient information as to the situation In Egypt toenable it to come to a decision on tho question.      Itwas 8greod that Sir Gilbert Clayton and another officialshould be summoned from Egypt to give their views to theCabinet.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FCR FOREIGN AFFAIRS pointedout the serious risks that would bo incurred by delay in arriving at a decision.       It would very likely mean thatS8rwat pasha would withdraw his undertaking to form aGovernment.       It must be remembered that although 2aghlulhas been doportod, the activities of tho extremist partycontinued.     If tho Cabinet refused to approve lordAlloaby&apos;8 proposals ho considered that they would be taking a false step whioh he would be unable to defend inParliament, and thai if wo lost the present opportunitywe might find ourselves entering upon a ^athwhich could only lead to one of two alternatives,
&apos;421annescation or a disgraceful capitulation.The Cabinet agreed :-(i) That it was undesirable to reach a conclusion in the absence of theLord .&apos;?rivy Seal and othor Hinistorat(ii) That tho Secretary of State for foreignaffairs should incite Lord -JLlonbyto send immediately to ...ondcn for consultation Sir Gilbert Clayton andanother official from ligypt.

? SITUATION IN INDIA.

 MR. MONTAGU referred to the telegram received from the Viceroy, dated 18th December, (Annexe I) emphasised the need for an immediatereply to Lord Reading as the Prince of Wales was due to arrive in Calcutta on the 24th instant, and the Viceroy who was to receive a deputation headed by Malaviya on the 21st instant,was to leave Calcutta on the 22nd instant.

 He explained the nature of the volunteer movement in India. It consisted of the drilling of bodies armed with "lathis" which were used as a substitute for rifles for drill purposes. The volunteers had appeared in Bangalore, Delhi and Campore. Their number was small but he had impressed upon the Viceroy that the drilling was an intolerable insult to Government. Up to now the movement had not become dangerous and it was not illegal but it was a dangerous movement and the Viceroy proposed to pass legislation at the next session making it illegal. The volunteers referred to in Lord Reading&apos;s telegram were of a different nature. They were an association of young men not of a military stamp organised to take part in the non-co-operation movement and to render social service. The movement had its commendable side, for one of its objects was to break down the barriers of caste and to give assistance to the untouchables. These volunteers in the present situation have become dangerous. They are now used by the non-co-operators to organise "hartals" and for purposes of
lrrtlml-datlono     The VIceissy* a policy c?i* 4?*&quot;&amp;3 hadimmediately been successful .     The non-co-operatorsbecame alarmed and at once made a movement for an accommodation with Government.     He read a draft ofhis proposed reply to the Viceroy as follows&quot;Private and personal.     Your private and personal telegram of the 18th Decemberreceived last night at a time when theGovernment is deeply preoccupied withan International Conference*     They aredesirous of sending you as,helpful an answer as they possibly can, bub timedoes not permit either of detailed examination of all the bearings of your proposals or of elucidation of certain aspects which would appear to require futher consideration,:.At,    H,M,,*3 Government would of courseoffer no objection to your agreeing toreceive in Conference anybody whom you would desire to receive^     A discussion would certainly have the obvious advantages of leading to the formulation of the demands made &quot;by the different sections of indian opinion-5 and in the discussion the sincerity of your Government., and what it had already done and is doing could be forciblydemonstrated,-      Therefore if you are askedto agree to a conference, H*M.&apos;s Governmentwould concur in your agreeing, but theywould make two observationse(1) You will of course not losesight of your duty to the Members ofyoTir legislature which must be fulfilledin dealing with those who have failed tosecure or refused to attempt to secure,election to the legislatures     I say this although it appears to be obviousthat your legislature would welcome such a conference,(2) I must not leave you in any doubt that it would be almost,  if not entirely, impossible to get Parliamentafter one short. year&apos;s trial, to extend the Government cf India Act.&quot;1919. andI notice that.,  as at present advised.,you see no necessity or cause for suchan extension,-     What is required 5,3that within the four walls of che. statute,  Indians should take advantage&apos;of their new opportunities as theywould appear to have done In tuia lastyear, so that they can come in due course to Parliament, and base their claims, not cn demands which were considered so recently, but cn actual work done and actual conventions cf political life established, and it may weU  bethat within the scope of the present &apos;Act these opportunities could befurther extended a-
B. In assenting to a Conference you cannot mean, I imagine, to make it conditional upon a welcome to the Prince of Wales,   any idea of such a bargain would) it seems to ushe most improper and certain to have unfortunate-nate consequences in the future.      You can,of course, make it quite clear that a conference would he impossible if the Congress leaders and those who follow their lead were breaking the law and necessitating prosecutions or evenactively indulging in hostile demonstrationsand that a conference would only be possiblein an atmostphere of peace,.   Any idea of using the Prince as the consideration for a bargainshould be eschewed and if necessary repudiated.C, I come now to the release of prisoners and the withdrawal of the proclamation againstvolunteers.      I find it difficult to agreeto the release of prisoners except on an understanding that they will,, on release,abstain from those activities which renderthen liable to prosecution, and with a clearlyexpressed determination that they will be prosecuted again if there is any repetition of the offences for which they are nowiraprsioned, but bargains with individualprisoners are useless unless supplemented by undertakings from those who are In aposition to direct their actions.   Further,it seems to me impossible to say that becauseyou have assented to come into conferencefinstitutions which you regardeqV&amp;s illegalyesterday you now regard as legal, whichwould be the result of the withdrawal of the proclamations.      The proclamations would onlybe withdrawn If it were shewn that the volun-teer associations, had ceased to be dangerous to the public order, or if their members had ceased to commit breaches of the la-i&quot;.    Thatis to say, the proclamations could only be withdrawn on an undertaking that militarydrilling and interference with public order and with the liberty of the public or of individuals would cease to be practised,I am sure I need not remind you to considerthe position of local Governments and protect their prestige in whatever action you may decide on.Subject to these observations. Hiskajesty&apos;s Govern ent concur in your proposal.LORD CURZOK stated the Viceroy1s telegram raised the most formidable and far reaching questions of policy,and the draft reply did not appear to him to meet thesituation.      The Viceroy appeared to be ready to(3)
compromise the  whole Indian policy of th  (^o-rarnmsB-f,,^5..to endanger British rials in India in order topurchase the ephemeral advaa/taga of a good receptionfor the Prince of   ,ales in Calcutta.       Inview of the ocurse of events in India during the past three months, he thought that Lcr3 Reading&apos;s action inarresting largo numbers of Indians, includingprominent men, leaders of society and members of council at the present time then the Prince was inIndia, to be most unfortunate.     The idea of makinga bargain with Malaviya&apos;s deputation, agreeing thatthe Government of India should withdraw the Proclamationagainst the volunteers and hold a oonfero:ico with alltho disloyal elements in India, if non-oooporatorswould consent to can-col the &quot;hartal&quot; arranged for Calcuttashould never be agreed to.     It must be clearly understo-cthat the Conference suggestsd in January at Delhi wasnot an ordinary conference.    It is-based upon the analogy of the Irish Conference,  and as pointed out byLord Reading, it is certain that it inevitably means the discussion of   Swaraj   and the repeal of the government of India Aot of 1919.    He strongly opposed the idea of any such Conference being sanctioned.There could be no concessions on the question of &quot;swaraj&apos;-and if the conference, had no results the consequences would be deplcr&amp;blo.      As it had been known for sometime that a &quot;hartal&quot; in Calcutta was probable, suitablemeasures should have been taken to meet the situation,and. the Viceroy should have referred the question toHis Majesty&apos;s Government at an earlier date.     LordOurzon added that he had discussed the anestion with the(4)
Lord&apos;-Chancellor, who had informed hira thatprims, facie ho was opposed to tho idea of thesugge.3 to d Conference .IE, CHURCHILL entirely agreed &quot;with Lord Curzon&apos;remarks,   He was strongly opposed to consent hoinggiven to a Oonferenee at twenty four hours&apos; notioe* If aConference was agreed to, it would mean   an immediatedemand for the scrapping of the Mentagu-Chelmsfordreforms and the demand for the substitution of some form of self--gcverenm-ent.     The idea of bargaining fora good reception for the Prince of Wales in Calcuttawas most ignominous.    It would be far better to cancel the visit of the Prince of Wales to Calcutta,  than to compromise the Government&apos;s policy in India in orderthat he might have a good reception there.    Hesuggested that the Viceroy should be informed that nodeparture in policy should be made by him in order tosecure a good reception for the Prince in Calcutta andthat the question of whether the propose? conference should be &quot;held or not would be considered by his majesty&apos;s  j e s ty! s G ov ernmen t in th e ens uing we ek,MR, M0BT1GU dissented from the vietf-s expressed bylord Curzon and Mr. Churchill.     He had always been ofopinion that a conference with the disloyal parties would ultimately be necessary.      If this view was correct, it would he unfortunate to refuse a conference to Maiaviya5 s deputation,  only to be forced into a,conference at a later date, after disturbances and bloodshed.     He proposed to make it clear to the Viceroy that parliament would net nov/ consent to any radicalamendment of the Government-jof India   Act of 1919, but
Tig did not see -why extensions might net &quot;be made withinthe limits&apos; of the existing law*     It was difficult inIndia for the Government to get in touch with publicopinion and he believed a Conference would be the best means by which the Yi coroy could explain the point ofview of the Government to the peode generally.     TheViceroy would thus be afforded an opportunity of informing the agitators that there was no chance ofany itemedia-ta step being taken war&amp;s the establishmentdf &quot;swaraj&quot;.     He proposed that the viceroy should be told(1)    that the holding of     Conference should in no way be ma/le conditional upon a favourable reception being given to the Prince of Walesat Calcutta.(2)    that the proclamation against the Volunteersshould stand,   and*&apos;3)    that His Eajesty&apos;s Government will notat present sanntion any ohange in the constitutionof India.If * a Conference wore heljd in January, it would mean av..period of three or four months before the resultinginstructions of His ;vJaiesty&apos;s Government could be for-warded tc India, and during this period the forces of disorder in India might abate.MR. flISHHR, on the whole, agreed with Mr.Montagu&apos;s suggested reply, but considered that itshould be strengthened in certain respects.     he considered that if the Viceroy went into a conference it should be made perfectly clear that no extension ofthe Government of India Act of 1919 oould be approved 1
 His Majesty&apos;s Government at present, ? that there should be no bargaining over the reception to the Prince of Wales. He was opposed to the release of prisoners unless a satisfactory and collective guarantee for their future good conduct was given to the Indian Government. He was of opinion that the proclamation against the volunteers should not be cancelled. These conditions would he thought be safeguards against the evils to which Lord Curzon had drawn attention. The extremist party in India was powerful and increasing in strength. They would soon produce a definite political programme, He thought it would be advantageous to bring them now into contact with the Government of India. One of the greatest difficulties of the Government of India was the paucity of the means at its disposal for making its position known to the people.

 MR. CHAMBERLAIN said that he was much disturbed by the Viceroy&apos;s telegram. The Viceroy had placed the Government in an exceedingly difficult position in laying before them proposals of a far reaching character,  to which he was apparently already half committed, and in demanding a reply within twenty-four hours. He feared that the Government of India were losing control over the situation and were losing confidence in themselves.

 He was opposed to a decision being given in a hurry as to the conference, and to the conference being in any way connected with the Prince of Wales&apos; visit.
He was inclined to reply to the Vioercy that If he-was doubtful of the success of the Prince1 s   visit the Prince should net gc to Calcutta.     That would heequivalent to a censure of the people of Calcuttawhioh &apos; they ha&amp; no sited.His Majesty1 a Government should not consent tothe Conference until they had boon informed of theresults of the proceedings&quot;in Cornell on the 20thDecember and of the meeting with the deputation on the21st.It was desirable that the Viceroy should be askedfullyto inform His Majesty&apos;s Government/of the scope and nature of the Conference proposed by the deputation and who was to be present at it.The general sense of the meeting appeared tobe that, lord Reading should, be instructed that when he received the deputation on the 21st December, he should inform them that His Majesty&apos;s Government hadnot been consulted with regard to the proposal tohold a Conference In January, and that ho was thereforeunable to comply with their request I      He shouldrequest the deputation to submit thoir viows as tothe scope and membership of the proposed Conference,and that he should forward their proposals to HisMajesty/s Government for their consideration.The Viceroy should also inform the Deputation that HisMajesty&apos;s Government could not entertain any suggestion for the radical amendment of the Government of india act of 1919, and that no bargain should be made witha    -
regard to the Prlnce&apos;-of &quot;Wales : &quot;visit&apos; to Calcutta.ConclusionsThat Mr. Chamberlain and backward Montagushould prepare a telegram for despatch to the Viceroy based upen the views expressed by the majority     cf the-Members of the Committee.- -XcMR, MONTAGU desired that his dissent from theopinion of the majority of the Committee be recorded.0&amp;    The Telegram is printed as Annexe IIto these Minutes*p Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,20th December. 1921.
Ft &apos;om Viceroy, ISlh December 1921,Very secret and very urgent. Situation now developing very fast. Time is very short as His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales arrives on 24th. I leave on the22nd, and if anything is to be arranged, it must be by the 22nd at latest. Brieflystated position is : (1) Immediate objective is to prevent trouble or demonstration by abstention and;hartals when Prince arrives! I attribute the greatest importance to visit herebecause -(a) An unpleasant reception in Calcutta would affect the public mind in England,.and even here, far more than Allahabad.(b) It would, I fear, provoke racial bitterness and collisions between Europeans.and, with them, Anglo-Indians, on the one hand, and the Indian population on the other.   Feeling runs high.(c) The proclamation of the volunteers here and in some ether provinces, and the-consequent demonstrations and arrests, have caused state of tension which,although at present non-violent, is nevertheless causing great excitementthroughout the country, and particularly is bent on (? getting omitted)many respectable Indians to protest against Governments action andtendency to associate prosecution with non-co-operation.Moreover, the imprisonment of men, or their sons, well known in the city, and of otherwise unimpeachable reputation, causes emotion, particularly amongst thethoughtful in Bengal, and for the moment calmness of judgment of government action is absent. Moreover, the many stories of excess of authority or undue-interference and high-handed action, have their effect. Doubtless, as generallyhappens, some individual regrettable acts may have been committed under verydifficult, circumstances, but wild exaggerations are circulated. Lord Ronalclsliay is-doing everything possible to prevent excesses by the authorities, and to correct abusesAvhere they exist.(2) This immediate objective can only be reached, if at all, by my immediatepromise to invite members of jhe different political sections, including, of course,non-co-operators and moderates, to attend a Conference at. Delhi, probably inJanuaiy. Prlind iacie there can be no objection ; indeed, 1 would welcome discussion which, even if it result in nothing practical, will not make the position worse, andmay have good effect. The policy of merely enforcing the law is, of course, negative,and although essential for the purpose of establishing and maintaining authority, is-not in itself a remedy.   It only prepares the groiind for it.I have all along been anxious to meet the agitators1 and to strive to understandtheir practical propositions, which have never yet been set forth, save as regards the:Punjab and the Khilafat. &apos; What is meant by Swaraj, when used by the various-leaders, has never yet been defined. Nevertheless, there is generally throughout India, even though in many respects vague and undefined, a desire for some-form of responsible Government. My impression is that the phenomenon now-witnessed of men of moderate views protesting against the present Government policy,,for which they called so recently, is largely due to undefined aspirations for Swaraj,:which imite the different parties of Indians in sympathy in this respect,I give you this appreciation of the situation because I want you to understandclearly what will, or may be, the effect of our agreeing to enter into a Conference-The control of the situation is of course with you at home. Nothing can be effected,.,obviously, without Cabinefs assent and Paiiiament&apos;s approval of any proposal.We are bound by the period mentioned in the Act of Parliament. Doubtless, asI have understood your speeches and as is obvious, Parliament if it chose mightconsent to an earlier period of revision. I am not myself at this moment prepared to-go further than say that T can conceive proposals for amendment of the present Act&apos;with the object of. improving the constitutional machinery and advancing on the road to the ultimate goal of Dominion status. But I am not prepared to advise this &apos; step-at present, or even, so far as I can gather, in the immediate future. But yet I do-see that the: pace is quickening ; my own view at the moment is that dominion status will have, to come by successive progressive stages.. Proposals at present under discussion, and which must either succeed or fail within-the next two or three days, have been made by Mala viva, but require at present the:authority of Gandhi before they can be made effective.   He asks me to receive a
Telegram just received from Jamnadas Dwarkadas, vvlio had been to Ahmedabadto see Gandhi, that Gandhi agrees to attend Conference and makes no conditions.   I-am still awaiting GandkPs answer to Malaviya respecting the Prmce&apos;s visit, and as you will understand the present proposals centre upon the better conditions for the prince&apos;s visit.I am most anxious to receive His Majesty&apos;s Governments approval to this course.So far, I am committed only to receiving the deputation on the 21st, which will be announced by Lord Ronaldshay to-morrow afternoon in his Council. But nothingcan happen and no arrangement can be made unless I agree to call a conference in answer to the deputation on the 21st. You will observe how short the time is.-and how much will be left to be done between that date and the 24th, when the prince arrives ; and I beg, therefore, that you will most urgently send me an answer at(nice, especially as I have many other arrangements to make in connection with thismatter.If you have difticulty in getting a Cabinet decision, I hope you will get that ofthe Prime Minister and others whom you think of greatest importance in Indianaffairs. Please remember that the Irish situation has given tremendous impetus to&apos;;the movement here for conference. All parties of Indians seem to agree in desire forconference as way out of present difficulty. I fear that, if I refused it, the effect would be to break down the whole Reform Scheme, for I think the various councils and the Legislative Assembly would undoubtedly pass resolutions to this effect.Please also bear in mind the position of my Indian colleagues in the Council. i cannot, myself, see any serious objection to the course I am proposing, provided weobtain the change of attitude regarding the Prince of Wales&apos; visit, which will quite- alter the atmosphei-e and relieve the tension, and is an essential condition.Throughout, I have borne well in mind the position of the British here, as well as the indians.Of course you may use any parts of this telegram you choose, but do not makeany public announcement till you hear from me.
From Secretary of State to Viceroy, 20th December 1921.Clear the line.Private and personal. Most urgent. Your private and personal telegram of IStbDecember, received last night at a time when the Government is deeply pre-oceupiedwith an International Conference. I am sure that you will realise the great difficultyin which the Cabinet is placed when it is consulted on so grave a question and.requested to give an answer in 24 hours. We have no opportunity of seeking the further information or explanations from you which we should desire before giving our decision.In this case your telegram leaves us in some doubt how far you have already committed yourself by your conversations with Malaviya or others; but we assumesince you ask our opinion that at this stage, you are still free to assent or dissent from the summoning of the conference as may seem best to you after t to-morrow&apos;sdeputation. On this assumption we proceed to state how the proposal for a conferencestrikes us.(I) We fear that it would be difficult to reconcile the reception in conference ofthose who have failed to secure, or refused to secure, election to the Legislature, withthe proper respect owing to the members of your Legislature. I say this although itappears that your Legislature would welcome such a conference.(2) More important still, we cannot see how it is possible to prevent such aconference from developing into a simple demand for swaraj, and for scrapping ascheme of Government approved by Parliament only two years ago and in operation for less than one year. My colleagues felt that mere formulation of such a demand b\*a conference summoned by you would be an act of grave moment, and would greatlyweaken your power of resistance and strengthen the dissatisfied and disaffectedelements. If the conference were of a kind likely to produce a settlement satisfactory to you and to us, much might be said for it, but failure to secure agreement or a formal demand for impossible terms would leave us in a worse position than now.The Cabinet held that a conference which fails is infinitely worse than no conferenceat all.I must not leave you in any doubt that it would be impossible to recommend toParliament, after one short year&apos;s trial, to extend the Government of India Act, 1919,and I. notice that, as at present advised, you see no necessity or cause for such anextension. What is required is that within the four walls of the statute, Indiansshould take advantage of their new opportunities as they would appear to have donein this last year, so that they can come in due course to Parliament, and base their claims, not on demands which were considered so recently, but on actual work done and actual conventions of political life established, and it may well he that within thescope of the present Act these opportunities could be further extended. .In discussing prox^osal for a conference you cannot mean, I.imagine, to make itconditional upon a welcome to the Prince of Wales. Any idea of such a bargainwould, it seems to us, be most improper and certain to have unfortunate consequencesin &quot;the future. You can, of course, make it quite clear that a conference would-beimpossible if the Congress leaders and those who follow their lead were breaking thelaw and necessitating prosecutions or even actively indulging in hostile demonstrations,&apos;and that a conference would only be possible in an atmosx^here of peace. Even theappearance of using the Prince as the consideration for a bargain must be avoided.I come now to the release of prisoners and the withdrawal of the proclamationsagainst volunteers. I find it difficult to agree to the release of prisoners except on an understanding that they will, on release, abstain from those activities Avhich render them liable to prosecution, and with a clearly expressed determination that they willbe prosecuted again if there is any repetition of the offences for which they are nowimprisoned, but bargains with individual prisoners are useless unless supplemented by undertakings from those who are in a position to direct their actions. Further, itseems to me impossible to say that because you have assented to come into aconference, institutions which you regarded as illegal yesterda3^ you now regard as-legal, which would be the result of the withdrawal of the proclamations. the proclamations could only be withdrawn if it were shown that the volunteerassociations had ceased to be dangerous to the public order, or if their members had ceased to commit breaches of the law. That is to say, the-proclamations could onlybe withdrawn on an undertaking that military drilling and interference with public-order and with the liberty of the public or of individuals would cease to be practised.I am sure I need not remind you to consider the position of Local Governments andprotect their prestige in whatever action you may decide on.
You will see that the objections to a conference and its possible results enter-^tamed by the Government made it impossible for us to sanction your announcing aconference at the deputation to-morrow, even though such an announcement mighthave insured a proper reception of the Prince of Wales at Calcutta. The cabinet felt that these apprehensions were such as to outweigh the risks of hartals, &amp;c., oreven if you thought necessary the cancellation of the Prince&apos;s visit to that city.In any case we shall be glad to learn from you after you have heard the depu-tation what is the exact scope and character of the conference that is proposed, andif, after considering our views, you still think such a conference desirable, we shallmost carefully consider the arguments by which you and your Government siipportthat proposal.

(1)  &apos; TIES SECRETARY 02? STATS 2?0R THE COLOIHLS informed the Conference that since his memorandum (CP.3515)was written he had had the opportunity of discussing-&apos;the situation with the Seoretaries of State for War,India and Air.    They had no objection to the proposaxSput forward in the memorandum: unless, therefore,the Cabinet disagreed with the proposals, he sugger+edthat they should take note of the agreement reached between the three Departments.MR. FISHER pointed out that .it was desirablethat an attempt should be made to secure acceptance -fthe Palestine mandate by the League of Nations at t^einext meeting.    The   High Commissioner was much embarr-assed by the absence of that approval.    Two obstacleswere in the way:    the negotiations with America onthe subject were not yet complete, and Italy had notyet been brought into agreement..It was pointed out that it was not likely that italy would give her consent until after the meeting with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs at paris on January 9th.    If that meeting resulted in  paccommodation with Italy it was possible that she would agree to the mandate.The Conference:-Took note and approved of the proposalfor the garrisoning of Palestine^nade by theSecretary of State-for the Colonies, andconcurred   in by the Secretaries of Statefor War, India and Air.(2)    the SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIESexplained that the question raised in CP .-3565was whether consent should be given to a suggest!oithat Feisal should, get into communication withNaji Bey and ascertain from him privately ThatMustapha Kemal&apos;a intentions were in regard to Iraq.-
i ,   i       ?! ,iiTiie Conference- agreed:-V That there was no objection to Pel salcormruni eating with Haji Bey, provided itwas clearly under-wood that it was notwith the oblect of entering into negotia-tion3 with Kemal, but of discovering his attitude to Iraq,REVISI01T OF (3)    THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSTREATY of sevres, explained that he wished to have the instructions ofthe Cabinet on thi3 matter before proceeding to paris, where he had arranged to meeS the foreign ministers of France and Italy on January 9th.   Hehad informed M. Briand that he would send him inadvance the outlines of the proposals that he would lay before the Conference.   His proposals are set forth in CP.3571.   He explained that the situation had improved of late in two respects.    The relations ofthe Allies with one another were better, as were therelations between the Allies and the Angora Government.M. Briand had been severely criticised in France for making the Franklin-Bouillon treaty which it was generally recognised was both unfriendly to Englandand was, in effect, a betrayal of the Armenians.   I.- Briand had assured him that he believsd that theAllies could now come to an agreement with KemaloThe Greeks had placed themselves entirely in our hands,(i) Smyrna^ It had become clear that the only terms of peaceacceptable to the Turks would be the total withdrawalof the Greeks from Asia Minor.   It was, however,necessary tb secure the safety of the Greek population and Greek interests in.that region.   The alternative proposals set forth in column 4 of Cop. 3571 were explained.   Alternative fo,?ms of Government were&apos;proposed.   Either that set up in the Saar Basin wherethere is a governing commission appointed by theLeague/
League of Nations, the Chairman being appointed bythe League, or that set up in Lebanon where there isa Christian Governor   chosen by Turkey, with theconsent of the powers and immovable without thatconsent.     The Saar precedent was regarded as preferableas it brought in the League of Nations.     Tt was thoughtthat the League of Nations would readily accept theresponsibility that would be thrown upon it underthe Saar arrangement, provided that a satisfactorypolice force was established and paid for by the Turks,and provided no serious financial responsibility wasthrown upon the League.It was suggested that if the Saar system were adopted, the appointment of an American Chairman to theCommission would be advantageous in order to associateAmerica with the arrangement made.As rega&quot;rds the areas, it was thought that theproposed arrangement that the area should includethe Sanjak of Smyrna and the Kaza of Aivali was onthe whole preferable and that it was inexpedient tomade any reference to the arrangement proposed under(c) in the document communicated to M. Briand whowould probably communicate Britain&apos;s proposals tothe Turks.The Conference agreed  (a) As regards area, the third alternativein (c) should be omitted.(b) That the form of Government to be preferred should be that established in the Saar Basin,(c) That the Greek forces should be withdrawnfrom Asia Minor, and that a localgendarmeriej the cost of which should beborne by Turkey should be establised for the maintenance of internal order.
i) Western Thrace.

 It was agreed that the question of Western Thrace should not be opened.

ii) Eastern Thrace.

 LORD CURZON explained his proposals for re-adjusting the Turkish frontier in Europe in order to allay the apprehensions of the Turks.

 The Conference were reminded that the attitude of the Turks as regards Eastern Thrace had been coloured by their anxiety as to the safety of Constantinople from a Greek attack. If England and France would give a guarantee to secure Constantinople from attack by Greece, small concessions as regards territory would probably satisfy the Turks.

 Several suggestions were made for a new frontier, including one that the frontier should run north from Rodosto to the Maritsa River and should follow the line of that river so as to hand over the territory on its left bank including Adrianople to the Turks. The general view was that such an arrangement would be unfair to Greece which was to be asked to make considerable sacrifices as regards Smyrna. Another objection to the proposal was that it would at once raise the Bulgarian question.

 The Conference agreed:-

 That the Turco-Greek frontier should be amended so as to run approximately from Rodosto to Malatra Burnu as proposed by Lord Curzon.

v) Constantinople and Straits.

 LORD CURZ0N explained his proposals for the return of Constantinople to the Turks, for the reduction of the demilitarised zone, and the international occupation of the Straits.

 The Conference approved Lord Curzon&apos;s proposals subject to the observations of the General Staff on their military aspects.
t44(v) Armenia,I^RD^rnjRZOI^jqilaJjaed his proposals0     They-were-hriefly that an enclave should he created inthe South near the sea where, under guarantees ofprotection all the remaining Armenians should becongregated.     He admitted that it was possiblethat this suggestion might not be practicable; but itwas worth trying to do something for the Armeniansas to Whose fate public opinion in Sngland was much exercised.        ^Lord Curzon&apos;s suggestions were approved.(vi) Minorities. It was pointed out that as provisions hadbeen made in the Treaty of Sevres for the protectionsf the Mussulman minorities in Thrace, it was desirable that similar provisions should beincluded in the new TreatycIt was pointed out that the Powers nowrealised that the Angora Government would neverconsent to a partition of Asia Minor into sonesof special interestc      It was agreed that thisshould not be pressed, but that we should give assurances tc Italy and Prance that, so far as weare concerned, we would adhere to the policy laid down in the Tripartite Agreement0LORD CURZON explained his proposals as setforth in Column 4 of Cc ^.,3571.It was pointed out that it was very undesirable that we should incur the odium of imposing rigorousfinancial conditions On Turkey.      If we make no proposals both Prance and Italy will insist upon conditions more severe than thosewhich/(vii) tripartite agreement.(viii)FinanclalClauses.

In these circumstances we might with advantage leave it to France to put&quot;forward financial proposals.TK3 PRIME MINISTER informed the Conference that from recent conversations with 3ek r*Sami Bey and withthe Indian Mahommedan doputa.t-iouf. he realised thatthe financial clauses were regarded&apos; &quot;by the Turks asa matter of the first importance.   He thought our policy should &quot;be to leave the Turks independent in what remains to bhem of their dismembered empire,He was disposed not to put forward financial pro-posals oThe Conference agreed;-*That we should not put forwardfinancial proposals&apos; and that theinitiative in the matter should beleft to France,(4)    THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs undertook to revise his Memorandum in the light ofthe above discussion before circulating it to the,French and Italian Governments(5)    The question was discussed as to how the Treatyof Sevres in its amended form would affect publicopinion in India4   It was pointed out that thesituation in India wwld be greatly eased if india were allowed to be represented at the proposed conference in paris*It was suggested that Aga Khan, who was nowin Paris, should bo invited to be a member of theBritish Delegation *   It was not necessary that heshould be present at the meetings of the Conference;but it was suggestrvi   that he should be taken into ..the confidence of Lord &apos; Curson and consulted duringthe negotiations..   It was pointed out on the otherhand/
hand &quot;that Aga Khan-^was^ ^jao^:jrep^eeeirt^rti-^ of&quot;&quot; themain body of Mahommedane in India.   He representedonly a small section of the Indian.JSahommedanCHMBmunity.The general feeling of the Conference was-that the appointment of an IndianMohammedarfas a member o:T the british delegation at the Conference in Pariswould conciliate Indian opinion,,   lord curzon undertook to give the matter further consideration.(6)   MR, FISHER informed the Conference that he hadinftfirmation that the Greek army was in a very badstate, desertions were numerous and the army would soon cease to exist as a fighting maohine unlesssteps were taken to stop the process of deterioration.It was most desirable in the interests of the Alliesthat the Greek army should be kept in being untilthe negotiations with the Turks were completed.It was stated that the question whether theTreasury should sanction the raising of a Greek loanin the City was now being considered.   The Treasurydesired to impose a condition that a certain pro-portion of any loan raised in Great Britain must be spent in England.   It was understood that the Greekshad agreed to this condition as to four-tenths ofthe loan raised.The Conference agreed;-(a) It is desirable that the Greek army should be kept in being pending thecompletion of the negotiations with turkey *(b) That the Government wished to offer no objection to the raisin-; of loansin the Gity by the Greek and turkish governments.(?)   A short discussion took place on a su^-estionthrown out by K. Briand in a converstion with thePrime Minister and more formally in a conversationwith the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs onthe/

lEJf OYIvElfT        1.      With reference to Cabinet 93 (21) Conclusion 4,OAlilCT&amp;L tho Conference had &quot;before them a Memorandum by tha-OSISJIOH.Minister of Health (CP. 3574) upon tha financial(commitments of the Government in respect of schemes approved, by the Unemployment Grants Committee for capital expenditure to be incurred by Local authorities for works put in hand by them in order to provide employment.     It appeared, that when tho scheme for assisting Local Authorities was first set up, it was arranged at a meeting of the Cabinet Committee onUnemployment (C.U. 28* Conclusion 5 (3), thatschemes should not be authorised exceeding a total capital expenditure of  10 millions without consultation between the MinisUer of Health, end the Chancellor of thaExchequer.     Owing to an unexpected increase in theapplication from local        authorities the  10 millionlimit would shortly be reached, and, at a meetingof the Cabinet Committee on Unemployment (C.U. 45,Conclusion 1), on December 13th, it had been made clear that the Chancellor of the Exchequer was notprepared to sanction an increase of the limit which hadbeen provisionally laid down.     The matter had therefore been referred to the Cabinot, who had directed that the list of schemes before the Unemployment GrantsCommittee should be revised, with a view to eliminatingthose which were not of a strictly utilitariannature, and that the list, as revised, should be remitted for consideration to the present conference.On a review of the applications already received bythe Unemployment Grants Committee, it appeared that only a very small proportion      were for works suchas  arks and Reoreation grounds, and that the remainderoould not be classed as luxury expenditure.
The Conference were informed by the Secretaryof the Unemployment Grants Committee that up to dateaohcm.es haa boen   sanctioned by his Committee to thevalue of  9J- millions;     that tho total cost ofschemes which had not yet been examined amountedto rather under  51 millions, and that it might beantioipated that of those roughly one-sixth would be rejected,  judging by the experience of the pastadministration of the soheme.     There would,  therefore,probably be an excess of some  4 millions over the 10 millions limit, if the adminstration of cheCommittee proceeded without interruption.   Moreover,as schemes v/ere oeming in at &amp;ho rate of some 50 a day,and would continue to do sc during tho next few days,i* was probable that schemes amounting to a further one million pounds would be received before the end of theyear.     It would, therefore, bo unsafe to assume nyJanuary&apos;1st that, the total number of applicationswould be less . than  16 millions, making tan excess of 6 millions, of which  5 millions might be expected torank for grait, the remainder being rejected.The Committee wore informed that no indicationhad been given tc local Authorities that there was a financial limit to the capital cost of these schemes;that local Authorities had been pressed to send inschemes, v/hich woro no?&apos; coming In quickly, and thatthere would be a great cutcry and strong politicalfeeling if local Authorities were now informed thattho Government were unable to find any further money for financing schemes which they themselves had askedlocal Authorities to prepare.     It was made plain that
the omisslon-1;d&apos;inform Local Authorities of thofinancial limit which hafl provisionally boon fixedarose from tho fact that at the inception of thescheme it was thought that Local Authorities wouldnot bo anxious tc coco forward.      The flood of applications received * had recently developed to;-;n extent which had not boon contemplated.The Chairman suggested that the Departmentsconcerned should take-noto for future guidance that,when a. limit was provisionally fixed forany oxpenditure of this character, those concernedwith the administration of the sohomo must taicooare in carrying out the scheme, that there wasno risk of that limit bol-ng exceeded, unless anduntil a definite decision to oxoeed it had been taken.It was explained to the Conference that the standardvof unemployment which the Minister of Labour had laiddown for tho qualification of particular districts to have their sohomec approved, was 6$ of workmenunemployed, with a minimum of 300 persons.   It wassuggested that tho limit thus fixed was much too low,and that having regard tc tho extraordinary effort which tho Government had been obliged to make todeal with tho emergency, the limit of severity shouldbe comparable with the distress which had induced the Government to set up so expensive a scheme.It was suggested that the limit should be ,raised to 10$, but the Minister of Labour was unableto agree tc this without consulting his advisers.It was pointed out that inasmuch as the circular from the Minister of Health to Local
Authorities had been issued in September, with an instruction that in order to qualify for grants,work oh ab&amp;^aaes oust eomnveaoo before January 1st,local Authorities who had not submitted&apos; their sobernessfor approval before Christmas, could hardly complainthe Government had broken faith, if sanction were refused.After some discussion the Committee agreed:-That&apos; the limit of the total capitaloost of s&amp;hemes presented by localAuthorities, s&amp;d approved by theUnemployment Grants Ccmmittee, shsuldbe Increased from  10 millions to 13 millions, on the understandingthat the Minister of Health, the minister of labour. and the Secretaryfor scotland, in consultation with theSecretary of the Unemployment GrantsCommittee a should arrange to imposesuch tests, either in regard to the severity of unemployment in a particulardistrict j the date by which schemesmust be submitted, or the date beforewhioh work must oemmenoo     as would&quot;onsure that the total value of sohemesapproved w^uld fall within the limit of  13 millions.2.        Hie Committee had under consideration aquestion which had been raised at a meeting of theUnemployment Committee (CU. 44th Conclusions,Minute 5), relating to the proposal by tho Ministerof Health to permit local Authorities to developat the charge of the Exchequer account in connectionwith housing, building sites already purchased whichwere beyond what was actually required for buildingunder the curtailed housing programme.It was suggested that this should be done inlocalities in which there was serious unemployment which would otherwis^^o provided for, subject to
there being a reasonable prappect of the land beingreqjalrea for building at an early date for the naturaldevelopment of the district.     Losal authorities could at present undertake the work themselvos, withthe assistance of the 65$ grant of loan charges from the unemployment Grants Committee for half theloan pericdj but were not prepared to take therisk involved by this in the present uncertainposition cf the housing problem,It was stated by the Minister cf Health thatthe propoeal would involve an addition to theGovernment burden on housing account of about 50,000 a year.In the opinion cf the Treasury this figure wouldbe  80,000 for an indefinite number of years.   In theview of the Chancellor of tha Exchequer, housing expenditure was already proving a very heavy burden m th;State, and to add so large a sum would be a serious matter at the moment, when the Government were trying to cut down expenditure in every direction.It was stated that the Ministry of Healthwere of opinion that Local Authorities should beable to sell sites thus developed before very long,having regard to the fact that the price of building was ccming down, and that there was no reason why a large part cf the money should not be recovered,      1,000,000had been suggested as the total capital expenditure involved, but probably f-ne-half of that sum would meet tho needs of the case.     It wculd be in onerespect better that the money should be spent aspart cf the hcusing scheme, rather than that thedevelopment of building sites should be assisted
f54by the Unemployment Grants Committee,     Whore a housing scheme was involved, the officials of the Ministryof Health would examine the sites with tho groatestcare, and only sanction those which were reallysuitable for development^     This the unemployment grants Committee had not the staff to do.Tho Minister of Health suggested that the scheme could be worked In consultation with the unemployment grants Committee, and that the amount of money at thedisposal of that Committee could be pro tanto reducedto compensate :for any additional expenditure under thehousing sohemeoThe Committee agreed;To approve the proposal that iooalAuthorities should be permitted todevelop^ at the charge of theBxohsqufer account in connection with housing, building sites already purchased,beyond what Is actually required for building under the curtailed housing programme, provided that It oould hearranged that any sums charged to theExchequer should be taken pro tantoin roduction of the commitmaiisof the Unemployment Grants Committee.disability pensions &amp;poor lawrelief.30      The Conference had before them a rooommendationof the Home Affairs Committee to the Cabinet (H.A.C.100th. 0onolu3 ions) 9&quot;   that the Minister of Health be authorised&quot;to inform Boards of Guardians that the&quot;Government propose to introduce legislation&quot;which thoy would endeavour to make retrospective,&quot;permitting Boards of Guardians, in assessing&quot;&quot;the olaims of applicants for out-door relief,&quot;to ignore a part of disability pensions, but&quot;that they could not guarantee that the exclusion&quot;of a higher amount than a flat rate of 10s, a&quot;week would be authorised by such legislation,&quot;
The Minister of Hosll^asplelne 4 that it was   thepractice of many Guardians to deduct the whole or partof a disability pension in   computing the income of an applicant for cut-door relief, and this, under the lawas it stood at present,  they ware not entitled to do.As in London out-door relief was now a oharge upon theCommon Poor Pund., it would shortly bo necessary for himto inform tho Boards of Guardians that they were not entl-tlod to make 1his deduction, and the question for decision was whether, following the roc^mroendations ofthe Home Affairs Committee,he should inform Boards of guardians that they might continue to deduct disabilitypension, and that, if legal difficulties arose, theGovernment would pass legislation to indemnify them andto alter the law.The Secretary for Scotland stated that, apart fromthe merits of the quoBtion, he must press that so far asScotland was   concerned, no directions to Guardiansshould he given in advance of legislation.     Considerabletrouble had already arisen in Scotland from thodecision of the Government to authorise payment of out-door relief to able-bodied persons contrary to the strict letter of tho law, and tho action which had beentaken of curing the legal difficulty by subsequentlegislation had created a very difficult precodentwhich must on no account be repeated.
 The Conference were generally impressed with the difficulty of taking the action suggested by the Minister of Health in advance of legislation; while they appreciated the political difficulties which would arise, they felt that the Minister of Health must insist on the observance of the law. Parliament had already strongly resisted the payment of money in advance of Parliamentary sanction; this would involve expenditure, not merely in advance of Parliamentary sanction but in defiance of the law.

 It was pointed out that, while the Minister of Health must direct Guardians that such illegal payments could not be made a charge upon the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund, the Guardians could, if they chose, continue to bear the cost of the deduction out of their own rates, and the Minister of Health would incur no responsibility in the matter.

 The conference agreed:

 (1) that a final decision in the matter should be postponed, on the understanding that if the position became really acute, legislation could be passed, although no action must be taken in anticipation of such legislation.

 (2) that the Minister of Health should inform Boards of Guardians that the exclusion of the whole or part of a disability pension in computing the income of an applicant for outdoor relief was illegal and that any sums illegally expended in consequence could not be made a charge upon the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund.
