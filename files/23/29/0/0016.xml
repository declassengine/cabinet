($) With reference to Cabinet 15 (22), Conclusion 9,the Secretary of State for the Colonies informed the cabinet of a number of&apos;regrettable disturbances which had recently taken placei in Ireland.    Certain members of the Royal irish constabulary had been attacked at Clonmel, where they weredetained under the protection of the Provisional Government.Mr Churchill had protested to Mr Collins, who had repliedthat the British Government ought to take more care in pre-venting the distribution of lethal weapons to unauthorisedpersons.    He (Mr Churchill) had sent General Tudor to examinethe matter.    The capture of arms had put the rebels inrelatively a better position than the forces of the Pro-visional Government, who were complaining of the niggardlydistribution of arms to them.    Several hundred armed men had taken possession of Limerick, in defiance of the Pro-visional Government.    There were in Limerick certain british forces and certain forces of the Provisional Government..4^he latter were being reinforced from Dublin, and the formerwill have left the town by the end of the week.    Every effort was being made to resolve the situation without recourse tobloodshed.    The situation was an anxiotis one.    Further,there had been serious outrages in Belfast during the past week-end, and the situation on the border was reported, to be.very critical.    In view of these disturbances he did notbelieve it wo\ild be worth while proceeding with the Clones- - - &apos; t - &apos;-&apos;h MEnquiry.    Mr. Cope had failed to obtain the release of the &quot;/Special Constables taken at Clones.    The Provisional Govern-ment was.eager to re-open negotiations with the NorthernGovernment, but Sir James Craig, whom Mr Churchill had.seenonthe previous day,, was unwilling to meet the Southern-representatives while the men taken at Clones were still held as hostages.    Sir James Craig was depressed with hisreception at the Treasury and with the course of the
discussion on the Irish Treaty Bill in the House of Commons.Mr Churchill had informed him that he proposed to address a formal letter inviting Northern Ireland to enter into nego-tiations with the South, hut pending the liquidation of thesituation at Limerick he did not propose to press the matter.Once this situation was cleared up, however, he would not hedisposed to accept a simple refusal from the Northern Gov-ernment, in view of the heavy obligations in regard totroops and Special Constabulary which we were incurring ontheir behalf.In the course of the discussion which followed, it wassuggested that the attitude of Ulster might be modified once the fate of the Irish Treaty Bill had been decided in Parlia-ryy* &apos;    rr&apos;.-ment.    This  could not be under a fortnight.The Cabinet were informed that in the recent Belfastdisturbances the majority of the outrages were committedagainst Roman Catholics.The Secretary of State for War stated that the coneen-tration of troops in Dublin and the Curragh was proceeding,and there would still remain some troops in Cork which it wasnot possible to remove e pending the clearance of stores.   he did not intend to remove all the troops until after theFlections had taken place.The Secretary of State for the Colonies read a telegram which he proposed to send to Mr Collins and Mr Griffith, inwhich he expressed his  regret at the tmwillingness offheProvisional Government to release the Clones Specials,  and agreed to cancel the Enquiry.    In the telegram he also reported the results of his conversation with Sir james craig, and insisted on the responsibility of the SouthernGovernment for the preservation of peace and order .
Lt. Commander Hilton Young, the Financial Secretary ofthe Treasury, to act for the Chancellor of the Exchequeruntil the return of the latter from Paris.J1 IjEEMPLOYMENT (2) With reference to Cabinet 12 (22), Conclusion 4,INSURANCE.the Minister of Labour drew attention, as a matter of extreme urgency, to the question of Unemployment Insur-ance, in regard to which the following Memoranda were before the cabinet memoranda by the Minister of Labour(Papers C.P.-3689, C.P.-3724 and cp.-3784)&apos;.A Memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer (Paper C.P.-3801).The Minister of Labour informed the Cabinet thata large proportion of the Unemployment Benefit wouldexpire on April 5th next.     As examples, he mentioned that this would affect 60,000 people in London (25 per cent of those drawing Unemployment Benefit), 36,000 people in birmingham (50 per cent of those drawing UnemploymentBenefit), and 38 per cent of the same class in Dundee.Some comment was made on the relatively short notice given in bringing before the Cabinet questions relating to Unemployment Insurance, and it was pointed outthat the latest of the Minister of Labour&apos;s documents wasdated February 27, 1922.The Cabinet agreed -That a Cabinet Committee, composed as followsThe Lord Privy Seal (In the Chair)The Chancellor of the Exchequer PThe Minister of health the Minister of labour mr. R.B. Howorth (Secretary).should meet to consider the whole questionof Unemployment Insurance.
PROCEDURE AS REGARDS 3*       With, reference to Cabinet 1(19),GMLNEtS CONCLUSIONS.Conclusion 3, the Minister of labour, inthe course of the discussion leading to thepreceding   Conclusion, stated that his pro-posals for dealing with Unemployment Insurancehad appeared in detail in certain organs ofthe Press on the previous day..The Secretary of State for the Coloniesstated that practically the very words he had used in the discussion in regard to RussianRelief had been quoted in the Press.The Prime Minister said, that his firstinformation of the subjects to be discussed at the Cabinet that day had reached, him not from the Agenda Paper itself but from the dailyPress.Other instances of leakage were thenquoted.     Attention was also drawn to the largenumber of copies of Departmental Memorandarequired by the Cabinet Office for distribution.In this connection it was pointed out that thework of the Departments in preparation for cabinet meetings necessitated tho distributionof a certain number of such documents amongdepartmental officials^The Secretary was instructed. to examine this question carefully with a view to restrict-in g the numbers of copies Issued from theCabinet Office.The Cabinet agreed. :-(a) That in. future no copies of theCabinet Conclusions should be circulated;A
Co) that the- Secretary should have authority to send such remindersas lie might deem necessary.of conclusions reached, to theMinisters concerned;(o) that s file of Cabinet conclusions should be retained in the personalcustody of the Secretary and bemade available for consultationby Ministers or their authorisedr ep r e s e nt a t i v e s..Mote:    The Prime Minister has given verbalinstructions to the Secretary tc continue tosend a complete copy of tho Cabinet conclusions to H.M. the King.
(4) In connection with, the question of Unemployment,and with a view to a comprehemsive survey by the cabinet of trade, industry and employment, the Cabinet invited the President of the Board of Trade to take special stepsto obtain from the heads of industry an appreciation ofthe prospects of the various trades and Industries,including a statement of what markets have been lost, andthe present and prospective conditions of the variousmarkets.
;r(fssiA.FamineRelief.(5) With reference to Cabinet 69 (21), Conclusion 4,the Prime Minister stated that he did not propose to ask theCabinet to reconsider or reverse the views expressed againsta grant in relief of the sufferers from the Russian famine,especially as.neither the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs nor the Chancellor of the Exchequer was present,but he deeply deplored a decision which, in his view, wouldinvolve this country in a good deal of discredit.    He would only ask the Cabinet to review the question of the grant of stores .    He had. given an answer in the House of Commons  tothe effect that we had made a gift of stores to Russia.   Hewas now informed, that these stores were rubbish.    We were entitled to refuse help to a starving population, but itwas utterly unworthy, while pretending to help, to sendgifts of useless stores.    He asked that at least theCabinet should make good the gift which he had announced in Parliament.The Secretary of State for the Colonies agreed thatit was disgraceful to take credit for a worthless gift,  andthat we should send a fresh parcel to Russia.&apos; . The Cabinet agreed  That the President of the Board of FJducationshould arrange with the Departments concerned for the despatch of fresh stores to the valueof the former parcel.Admission ofRussian Chil-dren to thisCountry.To refuse the request of philanthropic organ-isations to invite Russian children to thiscountry.Preventionof the spread ofTyphus .The Prime Minister said he strongly approved therecommendation made by the Lord President of the council that all possible measures should be taken, under the auspices of the League of Nations, to prevent the spread,of typhus from Russia.    This was not so much a question of humanity as of common prudence, and he was in favour ofour making a direct contribution from the Treasury.
It was pointed out that this policy had already been supported by the British Government, but that little hadbeen done by other Governments.The Minister of Labour stated that if the policy of preventing the spread of typhus involved a direct Treasurygrant, he was opposed to it unless he could be assured that money would be found adequately to cope with the needs ofthe unemployed at home.The Cabinet agreed  That the British Representatives on theLeague of Nations should give all possiblesupport to  the policy of fighting the spread of typhus, and should be prepared&apos; to promisea grant in support of such policy, in associa-tion with other European countries.The Lord Privy Seal undertook to give an answer in the House of Commons covering theforegoing Conclusions.
(6.)    THE LORD PRIVY SEAL stated that this question had become urgent because Admiral Hall,on moving the speaker out of the Chair on the Naval Estimates,proposed to move a resolution to the effect that theNavy should have their own air service.     I t wasurgent that the Cabinet should take a decision, on thisquestion in order that the Government might take upa definite line in regard to Admiral Hall&apos;s resolution.He said that he had received a letter from theSecretary of State for Air in which he stated the constant attacks upon the independent Air Ministry,both unofficially and officially, during the last twelve months had rendered the administration of theAir Force increasingly difficult.    He stated that the atmosphere of distrust and suspicion which has arisen between the services in consequence of those attackshas a most prejudicial effect upon the Air Force.    Thewithpresent position was most unsatisfactory/a^ friction between the three services and nobody holding a coitonondoctrine in regard to air matters.     The Army claimed that the functions of military advice and administrationnow performed by the Air Ministry should be transferredto the War Office, and the Admiralty desired that thenaval air service should come completely under their control.The questions for decision were - is the existing organisation of the Air Ministry to be broken up; isthe question of the maintenance of a separate AirMinistry to be regarded as open to further consideration;or, is it definitely decided that no change will bemade in the existing arrangements.THE SECRETARY OFTSTATE FOR THE COLONIES
THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES expressedthe opinion that to break up the Air Ministry would notsolve the difficulties.    Co-ordination between theservices would still have to be arranged for.     the geddes Committee had proposed the establishment of aMinistry of Defence as a co-ordinating authority, butthis suggestion had not been adopted.   He had expressedthe opinion that in the Committee of Imperial Defencethere existed a suitable instrument for effecting theco-ordination of the activities of the three services!He had further recommended that two technlca.1 committees should be set up, the first to make detailed proposalsfor the creation of a Joint Staff for the three services,and the second to make proposals for amalgamating thecommon services of the Army, Navy and Air Force.   &apos; he deprecated the destruction of the Air Ministry, and urgedthat the Committees proposed by him should be set up without delay.It was further pointed out that Sir Alfred Moridhad been appointed Chairman of a Committee to make proposals for amalgamating the common services of theArmy, Navy and Air Force.   The composition of theCommittee was discussed and the question arose as towhetherjit should include Members of Parliament or shouldbe composed entirely of civil servants.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR stated that he had shown in his Memorandum the great economies that couldbe effected by the amalgamation of the Air Force withthe whichthe Army.    He said that/friction and jealotisy/had been growing up between the three Services was deplorable.He, himself, believed that the Air Force would be the57LOS L* ooocooo*/O
most important arm in the future, but so long as it remained a separate service progress would be blockedby the obstruction of the older services.    On the other-hand, if the air arm were placed under the Army and navy, he believed that progress would be rapid.Pie suggested that a Committee should be appointedto advise as to whether the Army and the Navy shouldtake over their share of the air service.    He consideredthat the Air Force should be regarded as one of the arms of the service just as the cavalry and artilleryare, and that It should co-operate with the other armson eqiial terms.    He said that he desired to haveexperimental tactical exercises at Aider-shot this year with&quot;the Air Force co-operating with the other arms, butit was very difficult for the General Officer Commandingat Aldershot to obtain from the Air Force the servicesof a few aeroplanes for such purposes.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL drew attention to the paper whiclMr. Balfour had prepared for the Cabinet on thisquestion (C.I.D. Paper 149-C).   Fir. Balfour had pointedout that the position of the Air Force in relation tothe Army and Navy had been brought before the DefenceCommittee in: papers prepared by the staffs of all three services.    The conclusions presented in these papersdiffered widely from each other, and such discussions as had taken place on the subject at the Committee had made it fairly clear that no agreement was likely tointerbe arrived at by any further/sxchange of argument and counter argument across the table. In these circum-stances the decision of the main point at issue must
lie with the Cabinet.The general conclusions of Mr balfour&apos;s Paper were:-(i) That the Air Force must bft autonomous inmatters of administration and education:(ii)  That in the case of defence a,gainst air raids, the Army and the Navy must play a secondary role:fiii) That in cases of military operations byland or naval operations by sea,  the AirForce should he in strict subordinationto  the General or Admiral in supreme com-rnand;    and, lastly,(iv)  That in other cases  (such as the protectionof commerce and attack on enemy harbours and inland towns)  relations between the AirForce and the other Services shouldbe re-garded rather as a matter of co-operationthan that of the strict subordinationnecessary when aeroplanes are actingmerely as auxiliaries.He suggested that the principles laid down by Mr Balfourshould/be adopted.THE FIRST LORD-OF THE ADMIRALTY stated that he didnot urge the establishment of a naval service under theAdmiralty for the reasons given by the Secretary of Statefor War.    Naval opinion was more and more tending to theview- that aircraft would&apos; form an essential part of the modern Fleet.    He pointed out that the Board of admiralty had in the past been responsible not only  for advising asto the whole of the requirements necessary for carrying outthe naval policy of the Government, but also for seeing that the expenditure approved for that purpose is allocated to the best advantage.    The strength and composition of.naval air units for the Fleet now depends upon the  ir Min-istry, although the Admiralty are responsible for the tacticaland strategic employment of the Fleet in time of war.    TheAdmiralty considered that the air weapon would never be?   -satisfactorily developed for naval purposes until the
Admiralty were in a position to supply and administertheir own air service.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR stated that it wasexceedingly difficult to carry on the administrationof the Air Ministry under existing conditions, and tomaintain discipline in the Air Force.   The Force was becoming demoralised by the constant attacks made on it by the Army and Navy.      He urged that a decision should be given that the Air Ministry would bemaintained.   He believed that once it became known thatthe Air Ministry was to be retained, friction betweenthe three services would diminish and the co-ordinationof their activities would become more easy.   He KEXxindxareminded the Cabinet that a decision was urgent in orderthat the Government might take up a definite attitude on Admiral Hall,s motion.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL stated that thequestion was one of appalling difficulty, mainly becauseconditions in regard to air matters were changing everyday.    His views had changed in consequence of hisexperiences at Washington.    He learned there thatmillions of pounds were to be spent by the navies of thePowers on special vessels to carry aircraft and operate with the fleet.    In a future naval war aircraft wouldbe a vital and essential element in all.fleet actions^The operations of aircraft carriers was purely Admiraltywork, and he considered that the Admiralty must havecommand of the part of the air service that works withthe fleet.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL
THE LORD PRIVY SEAL pointed out that it was not theAdmiralty but the Air Force who had first discovered thevalue of aircraft in naval operations.    He stated thata lamentable feature of the discussion of air matters before the Indian Military Requirements Committee wasthat the services gave no evidence of an effort toco-operate or to regard themselves as the common servants of the Government in endeavouring to achieve one object.The Government were in a dilemma because while the Armyand Navy could not be counted upon to develope the^possibilities of the new arm, those who believed in anddesired to develop the air weapon were obstructed by the older services.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA suggested that thoseconsiderations made it necessary to arrive at an early decision.    As soon as it was known that it was definitelysettled that the Air Ministry was to remain, the attacks on it would cease.   Moreover, if no decision as to itsretention is now given there was a danger that theco-ordinating committees which Mr,Churchill&apos;s committee proposed should be erected would be diverted from their proper functions and would devote themselves to attempting to show that the Air Ministry should be abolished.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF EDUCATION suggested thatas the air arm was likely to become the most important,nothing should now be done to prejudice its future.    Thedecision of the Government to establish a separateAir Ministry was based upon war experience, and he considered that war experience was a true test of theorganisation.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES...fa-
256.&quot; ATHE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES suggested the answer should, be that the Government does not propose to abolish the separate Air Service, but proposes to establishtwo co-ordinating Committees,  as proposed&apos;in the Report ofhis Committee on Part I of the Report of the Geddes CommitteeTHE PRIME MINISTER suggested that the general conclu-sions set forth in Mr Balfour&apos;s Paper  (i) That the Air Force must be autonomous inmatters of administration and education:(ii)  That in the case of d.efenee against air raids,  the Army and the Navy must play a secondary rj5\le:(iii) That in the cases of military operations by land or naval operations by sea, theAir Force shotild be in strict subordina-tion to the General or Admiral in supreme command&apos;    and,  lastly,(iv)  That in other cases  (such as the protectionof commerce,  and. attack on enemy harbours and inland towns) relations between theAir Force and the other Services shouldbe regarded rather as a matter of co-operation than that  of the strict sub- ,ordination necessary when aeroplanes areacting merely as auxiliaries  might be accepted,  and that  the Admiralty request that astrong and impartial Committee be appointed, to enquire into the existing, system of naval and air co-operationmight be acceded to.It was urged, however,  that the question required further examination,  and the discussion was adjourned, theonly Conclusion being That  the Lord Privy Seal should reply to admiral Hall&apos;s Resolution of the 14thMarch., Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.1,March 8,  1922.
