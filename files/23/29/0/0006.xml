(0*123and G.T.660),
Reference was made to a previous decision whioh hadbeen made by tho.Cabinet in regard to the use of secretdocuments in tho compilation of the official historyof tho War (Cabinet 33 (21) Conclusion 9kIn the oourso of tho discussion which ensuedattention was directed to tho importance and difficultyof the question, particularly in view of tho frequentdepartures in reoont&quot;years from tho traditionalpracticer     These breaches had boon allowed to passwithout romonstrance-  end if writers were now to beforbidden to use secret official papers they would corn-plain of unfair di scr^Mnat i on *     There wore notoriouscases where the policy cf ministers had been attacked by-partial, and misleading quotations from Cabinet papers andgeneral sympathy was expressed with the desire ofministers to be allowed to uae official papers todefend themselves in such circumstances,     Stress wasalso laid on tho exceptional character of the issues raised by the Great War and to the controversies whichhad gathered around it which were in many respectsunlike those connected with ordinary party politics.It was also pointed out, that the matter had aninternational aspect as, contrary to undertakings whichhad been given during the Peace Conference, secretdocuments wore being made available to publicistsabroad who were giving a false or distorted impression of the part played by this country in the Groat Ware-
The following suggestions, among others, for meeting the difficulty were considered:-(a) Writers might be advised to reproduce theirviews without; specifIc reference to orquotation from Cabinet Papers.(b) Writers should be requested to obtain the permission of the Head of the Departmentprimarily concerned, who, in cases of doubtshould consult the Prime Minister.(c*) A tine limit should be fixed within which no Cabinet Papers should be made publicf.nd thereafter only after permission as in(b).(d) Rules should be drawn up for futureguidance by the Prime Minister and Headsof Departments in tho light of formerprecedents and recent experience andpossibly after consultation with leadersof the various political parties not members of the present Government.The Cabinet agreed(1) To appoint the following Committee to considerthe whole question:Prime Minister (In the Chair).nr. Chamber lain.-Mr. BeIfour.Lord Curzon.Lord Birkenhead.Sir Gordon Hewart.Sir K.P.A. Hankey (Secretary).(2) To request the Secretary to furnish theCommittee with particulars of the practice which had been followed by former Governments(4).   With reference to Cabinet 2 (22) Conclusion 1,the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed the Cabinet that after consultation with the PrimeMinister   and. the Lord Privy Seal, he had askedM. Poincare to postpone the Conference on EasternAffairs which had been fixed for February 1st at paris.     This decision had been taken after an examinetion of the &quot;Mote containing the views of the FrenchGovernment (CP, 3665) which showed so grave a miscon-ception of our attitude as to make an early agreementwith the French highly improbable.     Delay was furtherdesirable because we had no information of the attitudof theltalian Government.The Cabinet concurred in the actionfcaken by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs,
ANGLO-FRENCH (5)     With reference to Cabinet 2 (22) Conclusion 2;TREAT^t,The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs ce-called attentionto the text of the French proposal for an Anglo-FrenchFrenchDraft. Agreement and to a conversation with the French Ambassador(CP.3664).   A further communication had been received fromthe French Ambassador and would be circulated to the Cabinetimmediately.  (C,P,3 5S4A).Lord Curzon stated that lie would raise the whole subject at the Cabinet at a later date, and in reply to questions, added that it was not his intention in thecourse of the negotiations to go in the slightest degreebeyond the limits indicated by his colleagues in recent discussions.IRELAND. (6)     With reference to Cabinet 3;(22) Conclusion 6, theCompensation Cabinet briefly considered the claim which Sir James CraigforInjuries.       was making for the payment of  2,000,000 on account of Ulster&apos;claim of  6,000,000 as compensation for injuries.The Secretary of State for the Colonies, in reply tothe Chancellor of the Exchequer, stated that the Cabinet hadalready agreed that Ulster should not receive in this matterterms less favourable than were granted to the rest of Ireland.He proposed first to settle with the Free State on the basisof each side paying for its own damages and to conclude this settlement in such a way as to debar the Free State from making fresh claims to equal treatment with the NorthernParliamej.it when a settlement was made with the latter,The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that subjectto the safeguard indicated by the Secretary of State forthe Colonies he would offer no objection to the course proposed, to be taken.
(7) With reference to Cabinet 3(22), Conclusion 7, theSecretary of State for the Colonies read to the Cabinet aletter   dated 27th January, 1922, received from Mr. E.J.Duggan covering a draft ^reclamation of General Amnestywhich the Irish Provisional Government proposed to issue.(Appendix).The Cabinet agreedThat while In substance the draft was acceptablethe Secretary of State f*r the Colonies shoxildendeavour to have the form of the proclamationmaterially altered.(8)   Arising out of Mr. D\igganrs letter the cabinet considered the policy to be followed in regard to prisonersconvicted in England and Scotland, the Cwnnaught Rangers,and tho special cases in ulster.The Secretary of State for the Celpnies explained that inthe view of the Irish Government (in which he concurred) prison-ers convicted in this country before the truce ought to be 11b-erated.     The cases of persons convicted in Great Britainafter the truce were mere difficult and It might be desirableto await the result *f the Conference which was to take plaaeon Thursday between Mr. Collins and Sir James Craig and to conform our action to their policy.     The Connaught Rangershe would treat as pre-truce cases and set free.Strong objection was taken on grounds of nilitarydiscipline to the release of the condemned CennaughtRangers m part of a political amnesty.The Cabinet agreed :-(1) That the pre-truce oases.should be liberated.(2) That the post-truce cases should be further con-sidered after tho Dublin Conference..(3) That the Secretary of State for War should examinethe case of the Connaught Rangers with a view, ifpossible, to their liberation in connection withthe impending disbandment of the regiment.
IRELAND.

Prisoners in Scotland.

(9) In connection with the foregoing the Secretary for Scotland pointed out that in as much as certain Irish prisoners in Scotland would in a very few days have been in prison without trial for 110 days they would be automatically set free, apart from any question of amnesty.

(10) The Cabinet had before them the Heads of Working Arrangements for implementing the Irish Treaty as settled(subject to reservations) between the British and Irish Ministers (C.P.3648) and the Report of the attorney General&apos;s Committee on the legislation required to establish the Irish Free State (C.P.3653).

 The Cabinet endorsed generally the recommendations contained in these Reports and directed the attention of the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Attorney General to the following points arising out of them:-

(a) The desirability of raising in the body of the Irish Bill the question of the Schedules so as to preclude their detailed amendment.

(b) The question of making provision in the Bill for the salary and establishment of the representative of the Crown in the Irish Free State.

(c) The question of making provision in the Bill or otherwise for dealing with Bills passed by the Irish Free State which are, or may be held to be, contrary to the terns of the Treaty.

CANADIAN CATTLE EMBARGO.

(11) With reference to Cabinet 85 (21) Conclusion 4, The Cabinet had before then a Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries (C.P.3569) and by the Secretary for Scotland (C.P.3595) dealing with a proposal to remove the embargo on Canadian Store Cattle, in favour of which a Royal Commission had recently reported and for which the Canadian Government and certain interests in this country were pressing.

 /In the course
Tn the course of the discussion it was pointed outthat in England farming opinion was almost unanimouslyagainst the proposal, while in Scotland there was alsoa substantial body of the same mind.      On the other hand the large graziers, the purveyors of meat, and the co-operators were strongly in favo\ir*     It was therefore clearthat any legislation introduced for the purpose of removing the embargo would prove highly contentious and would disturb  .the agricultural districts at a time, when the farming indusrty was depressed,-After several Ministers had expressed their desire totake an unfettered attitude on the subject oln their con-stltuencies, the Cabinet agreed :-That an announcement should be made in parliament by moans of Question and Answer to the effect thatin the present ata-co at Agricultural opinion, it wasnet possible tor the,. Government to deal with thematter at presentoCIVIL (IS) With reference to Cabinet 71(211, Conclusion 11,SERVICEARBITRATION the Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the ChancellorBOARD. :   * .of the Exchequer dealing with the Civil Arbitration Boardand its relation to the Executive (CP.3051&quot;) and pointing outthat the existence of the Arbitration Board behind.the WhitleyCouncils enables the staff sides cf those Councils to evadetheir full responsibilities and at the same time preventsthe official side from shewing their full hand at the Councils.The Memorandum concludes with the following proposals &quot;.-(a; That the Arbitration Beard., and with itcompulsory arbitration, should be abolished.(b) That provision should be made for arbitrationbetween agreed arbitrators with the consent cfboth parties.(c) That Members of. Parliament should be added tothe official side cf the National Whitley Council.-.These Members shsuld definitely accept the positioncf forming part cf the official side,, and would beresponsible to Ministers and not to the House ofCommonsc
The Cabinet agreed :-(1) To approve proposal (a) abovec(2) To substitute the following forproposal (b) -i:That the method of discussion byWhixiey Council procedure will continue and if at any stage there is disagreementit will be open to either side5 in theordinary way. to suggest arbitration by consent as a method of making further progress.&quot;(3) To refer proposal (c) for further considerticn end, decision to the Chancellor sfthe Exchequer and the Minister of labour-CWhitehall gardens Si,Wa ,January 3Cth... l&amp;22f.
