SECRETARY&quot; .Alt^^TOOB.        Cl)   With reference to Cabinet 15 (22), Conclusion 6,ipjjf, Part of    the Cabinet had before the?? a Note by the Secretary (paper the Airforce of the   G.P.-F754). -Fntnre in imperial THB PHIW 3RA1 stated, that he had summonedDefence.the Cabinet in order to discttss &quot;the statement he proposedto make in the House of Commons on the following day inreply to an amendment to be moved by Admiral Sir ReginaldHall to the effect that a separate Havsl Air Force shouldbe established.   He had spoken eft the telephone to theSecretary of State for War on the subject of the line he proposed to take, which, though resulting from the cabinet decision referred to above, was not entirely confirmed bythe Cabinet Minutes, the discussion having been prolongeduntil a late hear and net completed.   Sir Laming Worthington&quot;vans had said that he must ash for a Cabinet decision onthe matter,   Unfortunately, owing to indisposition,. SirLaming was unable to be present that day.   The line he(Mr Chamberlain) proposed to take in his statement in theHouse was that the Air- Ministry was&apos; established during theWar as the result of war experience;   it was a statutorybody,- and therefore could not lightly he abolished. Althoughthe weapon for the Air had made rapid progress during theWar, it was still in its infancy, snd it was impossible nowto foresee the nature and extent of tha developments of thofuture.   He did not propose, therefore, to lay down a policy for all time,, but to state that, the present organisation ofthe separate Air Force sras satisfactory and that tha Covem-ment proposed to maintain it.The general question of the relations of the &apos; Air..Force with the TSavy and Army had been discussed by theStanding Defence Sub-Committee of the Committee cf imperialPefence on the assumption that &quot;an independent Air force was to be Maintained, and the following general conclusions were formulated by Sir Arthur Balfour
(i) That the Air Force must he autonomous inmatters of ad&amp;ilnistration and education?fii) That in the case of defence against air raids, the *riry and the Wavy roust play aawcend&amp;ry role;fill) That in cases of Military opsrations byland or Naval operations by sea, the AirForce should be in strict subordinationto the General or Admiral in supreme command:   and lastly,(iv) That in other cases (such as the protec-participator of conferee, and attack on enemyIsarbonrs and inland towns) relationsbetween the Air Force and the other services should be regarded rather asa.matter of co-operation than that ofthe strict subcrdimiion necessary whanaeroplane a are acting merely as auxiliaries.He suggested that the Cabinet should accept these conclu-sicna.As regards the oc-operation of the Navy, ho proposedttiat an Inquiry should be conducted Into the proper tnetheciof effecting co-operation between the Uavy and the Air Force,in order to ascertain how the Air Force ear. give to the navy the air service which the Navy requires.   He proposed to soon to- state that another Committee had been appointed tomake definite proposals for affl&amp;lgaffiatlng as far as possiblethe eotsmon services of the Army, Havy and Air Force, suchandas the Supply, Transport, FAucatien, asset&apos; Ifedical/Chaplainsdepartments, with a view to effecting economies in those services.   We did net think the Secretary -of state for Warexpected the Cabinet to come to a different decision.   TheSecretary of State for War had recognised that it wasIwnese-the o to sontlnne the present state of suspenseinvolved by the further delay of a decision?   but he argued that the feeling of the soldiers was so strong against thepropositions contained in Sir Arthur balfour * s memorandum that the scheme of a separate Air Force could not work.Mr Chamberlain added that lord Beatty had seen Mm on thiscuestion and had stated that he had learned that
Mr Chamberlain&apos;s view was that the Admiralty were not disposed to develop the Air arm and were jealous of the Air Force. Lord Beatty said that that was not true: the Navy was most anxious to develop the Air arm, they had already made great progress with it, and they would readily co-operate with the Air force in future developments.He had replied to Lord Beatty that he was misinformed as to his view; all that he had said was that in former discussions the Navy had conveyed the impression that the Admiralty did not fully realise the importance of the Air arm.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR assured the Cabinet that the Air Force was desirous of co-operating with the other Services to the fullest possible extent. He requested that the Terms of Reference to the proposed Committee as regards co-operation with the Navy should be so worded as to exclude from discussion the question of the establishment of a separate Naval Air Force.

THE LORD PRIVY SEAL concurred, and said that what he submitted to the Cabinet was that the question of the abolition of the separate Air Ministry was not now a question for discussion. What he had in his mind was that a Sub-Committes of the Committee of Imperial Defence should be appointed, with a Minister as Chairman,  who should not he the Head of one of the three Fighting Services, and that the Committee should lay down principles similar to those which had bean laid down by Sir Arthur Balfour in respect of the co-operation of the Air Force with the Army.

The Cabinet agreed --

That the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s statement should be based on the following policy:-


(a) That, while the Clovarnmant did not, proposeto lay down a policy for all time, the separate Air Ministry should be maintained:(b) That the following principles, formulated by Kir Arthur Balfour as the. result of an enquiry by the Standing Defence oub-Committee of the CoRsrottt.ee of imperialDefence, should he approved:-Cl) That the Air Force rmiat be autonomousin matters of administration and educations***** in the case of defence against air raids, the Army and the Uavymust play a secondary re 1 gt(iii) That in cases of Military operations by land or Ravel operation?, by sea,the Air Force should be in strictsuberdinati cn to the General crAdmiral in suareme cornmand&apos;   andlastly,tiv) That in other cases (such as the pro-teotion of--Oow.force, and. attach on enemy harbours and. inland towns)relations between the Air Force andthe other Services should he regardedrather as a matter of ee-operationthan that of the strict subordinationnecessary when aeroplanes are actingmerely as auxiliaries.(c) Thai a Subr*CoBfsmittae of the Committee ofImperial Defence should, be appointed toerfmiire into the existing eystew of Navalnv.j /j^r. co-operatl en and to advise as tothe way in which the Air Force can give to the Navy the Air service which the Kayyrequires:(d) That the lord Privy Seal should consult with the PriTse Minister as to tha preciseconstitution of the Sub-Committ ee.
(2) TKF. SWJRRTARY OF STATE FOR AIR stated that he desiredto b.rlpg to the notioe of the Cabinet the new programme of aerial, oonstruetlon that had jua t been approved by theFrench Government.   It was proposed to increase the estab-lishment of long-range bombing squadrons from 62 to 140.The French were new building 150 machines per month while we were building 2S per annum.   We had at present only onebombing squadron in the home establishment, but if theWatiisatea for 38 were approved another Squadron wouldbe added.It was generally agreed that the French air develop-ment constituted a formidable danger to this country, andthe Secretary of Stats fcr Air was requested to circulate a Memorandum to the Cabinet cn the subject.It was pointed out that the Standing Sub-Committeeof the Committee of Imperial Defence was now examining the question of the Continental air menace.The Secretary of State for Air was requestedto communicate the information as regardsrecent French aerial developrents to thatSttb-Commit tee, which was requested to
&amp;DXSBAITOw^T (S) With reference to Cabinet 15 CS3S), Concision 10,CF THB POYAT.IRISH COW-      the Cabinet had before them a ? &quot;awe random hy the ChiefSTABTJhAPy.Secretary for Ireland (Paper G.P.-SBS^), a Memorandum bythe Chancellor of tha Exchequer (Paper 0.P.-383S), and aoopy of a telegrasn from General Macready to the Secretaryof State for &apos;^ar (Paper C.P.-S84S), dealing with proposalsfor the treatment of the royal Irish Constabulary on d1s-bandwent,The Cabinet were informed that the Subject had beenconsidered by the Provisional Government of Ireland Consmit-tee, which had failed to reach agreement.TKF CHIRP SFOP^TART FOR SRFIAWD stated that the compulsory disbandment of the Force had become inevitable and was taking place mon* suddenly than had been anticipated,with the result that. the check in the careers of the r-ian was taking place at vary abort notice.   Tha men themselves had put tip demands for compensation which, if granted in full,would.cost about  6,000,000. - The Chief of Police and MrCope had formulated a scheme which wotild cost aboutEl,350,000.   His own proposal was much wore modest?   itwas that a gratuity in respect of disturbance should hegranted to the won, at a cost of approximately SSGO&apos;,000,this gratuity to be in addition to the terms premised Underthe Government of Ireland Act, and in addition to thefurther benefits to which the Treasury had agreed.   these further benefits were that pensioners who stay in ireland would be allowed to commute,in favour of a quarterlyannuity for two years, so much of their pension as, would increase their emoluments for the first two years duringwhich it is conceivable that they -might have some difficultyin obtaining employment if they remained in Ireland.   Also,any man who wished to leave South Ireland would receive a
Disturbance Allowance &quot;Tor removal , the total coot of whiohwas estimated at anything from  000,000 to&apos;  500,CGO.   Hewas prepared to admit that the. terms which the treasury had agreed to were generous terms, but,in view of the very exceptional circums tsnoea in which these man fotind themselves,and in view of the Prime Minister^ pledge (August 10, If 31)that &quot;the loyalty and gallantry of their services have beensuch that it would be a dishonour for any Government or any party. to neglect their inter eat a&quot;, he maintained that theadditional gratuity for which he pleaded was thoroughlyjustified.   Sixteen members of the Force had been murderedand a large number of tha&amp;i wounded.   He bells-zed the con-cession for which he ashed, if granted, would facilitate the passage of the Irish Treaty Bill through, the House ofLords,   Fe wished to remind the Cabinet   that und**r theTreaty the money for the payment of the pensions would befound by the &quot;Irish Free State, and he understood that themachinery of the Irish Free State would be employed to paythe pensions direct to the members of the Force.   This last point constituted a serious objection in the -minds of theman,, as their whereabouts would be fully known to the IrishFree State.   A decision was urgent, in. order to bring thematter to a conclusion before the end of the present financial year.   The diabandroant had been delayed at therequest of Mr J&amp;chael Collins,THE LORD PRIVY SFAI   held that the Prime Minister^pledge in effect was a -pledge that the Force would betreated not less favourably than under the 1$SG Act?   itwas not a pledge that they would be treated more favour-ably.-  THg G8AN0RLLOR OF THF RXCHFOJCRR said that in viewof the demand of the men for a scheme which would cost 6,000,000, it was not probable that the grant of thegratuity asked fcr by the Chief Secretary would in fact
appease them.   The taken were being treated most generously.Bach member would have twelve years added to the actualnumber of years served in calculating his pension, and theTreasury had agreed to commute the pension or to make advances on account in order to help men who found, them-aelvea in special difficulty.THR SSCRFTAW OF S^ATTC FOB T!TF OOLOflXKS said thathe was to see a Deputation on the subject that afternoon,and in his view the government had a good case on the basisof the terms conceded by the Treasury.   Kr Churchill then read out a large number of illustrative comparisons of theterms pre posed for the Royal Irish Constabulary and theterms which other State servants would receive on retirement.For example, en Irish Constable with five years actualservice would receive a pension of  1:7:0 per week, whereasa Civil Servant with similar service would be dismissed witha gratuity of  121, a Policeman  87, an Army soldier  100,a War Pensioner, with total disability,  ICC   Again, an irish fenstable, after IS years * service, would receive 2:17:0 per week for life, whereas^ Civil Servant with similar service would receive  1:3:1, an English Policeman 1:8:1, an Army Pensioner 18s.led.   In effect, the royal irish Constabulary was being treated almost: doubly as wellas any other class of persona.   In addition, it had beenagreed to set. up a strong impartial tribunal to considerindividual oases of special hardship, with power to recommendation-merd additional grants.   He thought the special tribunal should interpret its duties broadly in eases where men werebeinr? ats/bjeeted to a regular vendetta.   There was, in hisopinion, no force in the argument that tho Free State would pay the pensions, as the British Government guaranteed thepayment.
THE LORD PRIVY SEAL reminded the Cabinet that under the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, compensation would not have been paid to men offered re-employment. In the present case they had asked to be disbanded. He thought the Treasury proposals met the pledges which had been given, and that the terms were handsome.

THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF EDUCATION said that when the terms were embodied in the 1920 Act they were thought to be most generous.

THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL concurred.

THE MINISTER OF LABOUR said it was important that the tribunal should in fact operate, and operate swiftly.

The Cabinet agreed -

To adopt the proposals put forward by the Treasury (Paper 6,P.-3833), including the appointment of a special tribunal to consider individual cases of special hard-ship, with power to wake recommendations for additional grant.                                                                                                                                                                                                     

(4)THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES briefly referred to the personnel of the Commission which it was proposed to set up to hear and determine claims in respect of injuries arising out of the conflict terminated by the Irish Treaty.

Various suggestions were made as to suitable persons who might be chosen for the post of Chairman of the Commission.


is) The Cabinet had before them a Bfeisorsndtua by theFirst Lord of the Admiralty dealing with the proposal to close Kaulbcwline Dockyard (Paper c ,P.-S8r?) .   The admiralty had made arrangements for the closing of the Dockyard, andbad wade no provision in the forthcoming year*s Fstiisatesfor its continuance.   The cost of keeping the Dockyard openwould amount to  15,000 a month.   Strong representations,however, had been received by the Secretary of State forthe Colonies from ^ Michael Collins pressing that theAdmiralty should defer the closing of the Dockyard for afew months, as&apos; the Provisional Government hoped in the interval to prepare plans for the continuance of the Dock-yard under the control of the Irish Free State.In the course of the discussion it- was pointed outthat it was desirable to help the ProvisionaL government as much as possible, especially in County Cork, and thatif the Admiralty could arrange to send a ship to Kanlbew-line for repair it would be welcomed by the Free StateGovernment *   On the other band, It was but fair that theProvisional Government should undertake the expenses ofmaintaining the Dockyard after March 31st.The Cabinet agreed -**fa) That, tha closing down cf BaulbowlineDockyard should be postponed for thepresent: :(b) That the First Lord of the should arrange thatbesent for repair to Haulbowline Dockyardfo) That the Secretary of State for theColonies should arrange with the Pro-visional Government for the mainten-ance of the Dockyard after the end ofthe present financial year, any sumsadvanced --after Wareh Slst by the Brit3Government to be recovered as part ofthe general financed settlement..1 o.
OT^HSRAS (6) With reference to Cabinet 15 (S2), Gene lustSSTTfcmSBNT.the Cabinet agreed  To request the Secretary of State forWar to take the place of the lateSecretary of state for India as amember of the Committee on OverseasSettlement.
DIVERSION OF     (7) The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the ,CABLE FROM A,- hvLJ C*&quot;IRELA20) Postmaster General dealing with the proposed diversion^/ *yC^of a cable recently acquired from the Direct UnitedStates Cable Company (CP.3836), referred to the Cabinetby the Provisional Government of Ireland Committee.THE POSTMASTER GENERAL explained that the cable hadbeen purchased in 1920 for  570,000, chiefly with a viewof providing- an alternative in case of breakdown       theImperial cable.      It was located in County Kerry andconnected with London by a telegraph line.    The  traffic was remunerative and in order to admit of its beingworked in the most economical manner it was proposed to cut its connection with Ireland^ asa^l extend it to Penzance^and use it there as an adjunct to the Imperial cable.It had always been the int entionf quite apart from theIrish political situation to remove the cable from ireland before the Post Office took over its working,but in view of the creation of the Irish Free Statehe had thought it proper to consult the Cabinet before giving instructions to cut the connection with Ireland.From the strictly business standpoint the sooner the cable was joined to Penzanc e the better.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES said it was important to do notliing which would endanger the friend-ly co-operation of this country with the Free State andthat to cut the cable outside the territorial waters and join it to England would be an act capable of beingrepresented as having a sinister significance.THE CHIEF SECRETARY said that such an act wouldcertainly be regarded as a challenge to the good will of the Government and it Hast would also have the effectof throwing a number of people out of work in a remote-12-
. part of Xreland*lUR GBAmELJJjR. 01&quot; m EXCHI^USR said that it .should he brought home to tShe Provisional Governmentthat If the cable is continued as at present itwould involve a financial loss to this country.TBS lord 2&apos;B1TI 8 SAL suggested that the Chancellor^point should be used to brlagj pressure to bear on theIrish free state not to charge the full transit r&amp;tejgwhich they would technically be entitled to do.The Cabinet agreed:-That the Postmaster General should t ifuaoessary, raise the matter again afterthe Parliamentary Elections in southern ireland had &quot;been. held.-IS-
(8)    With reference to Cabinet 17 (22) Conclusion 4,the Minister of labour informed the Cabinet of thepresent position of the dispute between the masters andmen in the Engineering trades.    The General Council ofTrade Unions and the Parliamentary Labour Party had meton the previous day and were consulting the executive of the Amalgamated Engineering Union that morning.The upshot of these conferences would probably be thatstrong pressure would be brought to bear on the Governmentto put in motion the Industrial Cou^irts Act and institutean enquiry thereunder.      To refuse to do this would playinto the hands of the supporters of Direct Action and isthrow to their side a number of moderate men.      Inaccordance with the wishes of the Cabinet he was resistingthe request for an enquiry and would continue to do so aslong as possible on the ground that a ballot of the alliedunions was in progress and that nothing should be donein the meantime to prejudge the results of that ballot.These results would not be announced until March Sth.The Cabinet took note of the statement ofthe Minister of Labour and requested DrMacnamara to bring the matter again to thenotiiBe of the Cabinet before agreeing tothe appointment of a Court of Enquiry.
