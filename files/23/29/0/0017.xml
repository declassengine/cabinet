(RFJlTMBHT OP        fl)   With reference to Cabinet 75 (20), Conclusion 4UDIAMS INiAST AFRICA,    and Appendix I (3), THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES[enya. said that he desired tc explain to his colleagues, in regardto Mr Montagu&apos;s charge that he had acted in reference to kenya without Cabinet authority, that there was no founda-tion for that statement.   There were no less than fortyColonies under his administration, and&apos;important questions connected with them arose from day to day which had to besettled by him independent of the Cabinet.   He had ereatedno precedent In regard to the treatment of the Indian popula-tion in Kenya.   In referring to the proposal to reserve the highlands for the white population he was only carrying outthe policy that had been laid down by his three predecessorsin office, and it was entirely within the scope of hisDepartmental duties to make a statement to that effect.He added that he had discussed the question of the treatmentof Indians in Kenya with Mr Montagu for three months, andhad tried to,carry the India Office along with him.   He had arrived at an agreement with Mr Montagu in regard to certain matters, and had recently sent a despatch to the governor of Kenya containing these proposals.   These were, briefly,to extend, the privileges of Indians by abolishing segregationand the Invidious regulations as regards immigration.   Itwas proposed, however, that immigrants should not be admittedunless they were in possession of 300 rupees.   This wouldhave the effect of excluding all Indians except those of acertain social standing.   It was proposed also to reserve the highlands for the white population, and at the same timeto assign a similar reserve for Indians.   Although he didnot like them, Mr Montagu had agreed to those proposals.He (Mr Churchill) had been the guest at a dinner given bythe principal members of the European community of Kenya,and for his speech at that dinner he had picked out of the
(%i despatch several points in regard to which he and Kb? Montaguwere in agreement *   He did not go beyond what had been agreedto, and there was no question of initiating a policy whichhad not been approved by the Cabinet.INDIA. (2) At the outset of the meeting THE LORD PRIVY SEALproposed circulated telegrams exchanged between the Viceroy andPublicationof Farewell     himself between March 11 th and 13th (Appendix).Telegram fromJUT Montagu. THE LORD PRIVY SEAL, in setting forth the precisepoints at issue, began by giving the Cabinet a detailedaccount of the circumstances leading to Mr Montagu18resignation.    On Thursday, March 9th, when discussing Irisforthcoming resignation, Kr Montagu had told Mr Chamberlainthat he thought he ought to send a farewell telegram to the governors and Princes of India.   Mr Chamberlain had assumed that US? Montagu contemplated sending a telegram of thanksfor loyal co-operation, in the usual way, and had undertakenthat such a telegram should be duly despatched.   He had informed the Prime Minister of this, and the Prime minister had expressed anxiety in regard to the telegram, as he feared that it might contain an unfair and exparte version of the incidents connected with Er Montagufs resignation..Mr Chamberlain had accordingly instructed the India office that they might transmit any telegram of a private characterfor Mr Montagu, but that no telegram, containing a statement as regards the policy of the Government should be sent offwithout submission to him.   On Saturday, March 11th, sir edward Grigg became aware that Mr Montagu was sending a message to the Princes and Peoples of India which mightalmost he compared with a Royal Proclamation.   Sir EdwardGrigg had very properly taken the responsibility of tele-graphing to India that the message should not be publishedpending further instructions.     Mr GHAMBFRLATH then read to
the Cabinet Mr Montagu&apos;s telegram to the Governors andPrinces of India in the form in which the Viceroy proposedit should he leaned, together with a telegram from theViceroy to the Prime Minister and a telegram which he himself had sent on March 13th to the Viceroy, suspendingpublication of the proposed message pending reference tothe Cabinet.    (These are the telegrams in the Appendix.)After some discussion the Cabinet agreed  (a) That Mr Iv5ontagu*s proposed message should not be published:(b) That the Lord Privy Seal should, sonotify Mo? Montagu, from, whom a tele-phone message was received during themeeting asking that he might be in-formed of the Cabinet*s decision:(c) That the Lord Privy Seal should send the following telegram to the viceroy:-&quot;I have laid your telegram and Mr Montagufsproposed message before Cabinet.   We are quite unable to authorise publication ofsuch a message by you or your Government.The resignation of Montagu had nothingwhatever to do with anything connectedwith Government * s Indian policy;   and ifyou think it desirable :yo\i are authorisedto ptiblish the fact.   But we deprecateanything being said that can be misre-presented as even being in the nature ofan apology on the part of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment11.INDIA,to&quot; Montagu&apos;resignation.Froposed Bis-&apos; cussion inthe IndianLegislativeAssembly.(&quot;) THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said it was reported in the press that on Tuesday, March 14th, the adjournment of the Indianlegislative Assembly would be moved in order to afford anopportunity for discussing Mir Montagu&apos;s resignation.   Underthe Government of India Act, 1919, the Viceroy had authorityto disallow a motion for the adjournment of tha House, on theground that the matter was not primarily the concern of theGovernment of India.   He could thus prevent the discussionfrom taking place.    There were precedents for such action at home, as the Speaker had disallowed questions regardingthe action, of the Governors of Provinces In India.
In the course of the discussion some doubts were expressed as to the correctness of the Constitutional doc-trine implied in the Speaker&apos;s rulings.   It was pointed outthat the Government of India was actually a projection ofthe will of the British Cabinet, and to deny to parliament the right of&quot; discussing the action of the Government was infact an encroachment upon the privileges of the House ofCommonsOn the whole, it was thought better to make no reference to the rulings of the Speaker of the House ofCommons.There was general agreement, however, that theLegislative Assembly should not be encouraged to discussthe question of the resignation of Ministers of His Majesty*sGovernment.    Such matters had nothing to do with India.Unless the Viceroy saw the strongest reasons to the contraryit was felt that the discussion should not take place.The Cabinet agreed  That the Lord Privy Seal should send the following telegram to the viceroy of Indiat-&quot;Have seen statement in Press thatAdjournmeht is to be moved in Legis-lative Assembly tomorrow to dismissMr Montagu * s resignation.   The subjectobviously falls within proviso inparagraph 45 of Manual of Businessallowing you to disallow Motion if it-relates &quot;to a matter which is not .primarily the concern of the Governor-General In Council.   We presume that unless you see strong reasons to thecontrary you will exercise youss power&apos;to disallow.&quot;
BUS LOCK-OUT M        4.     With reference to Cabinet 15 (2a), Conclusion 2,BUS EHGIiiEKKlflGIftADB.   ,. the Minister of Labour gave the Cabinet a summary -of the circumstances leading up to the presentposition in the Engineering Trade, which may besummarised aa follows.After discussions lasting from May toflovember, 1921, the following agreement was arrivedat between the Federation of Engineering Employersand the representatives of the Amalgamated engineering union ; -&quot;1. GdgSERAL1. The Trade Union shall not interfere withthe right of the Employers to exercise managerialfunctions in their establishments and theFederations shall not interfere with the properfunctions of the Trade Union,2. In the exercise of these functions, theparties shall have regard to the provisions for Avoiding Disputes of 17th April, 1914, wniohare amplified by the Shop Stewards -and Wor&amp;sCommittee Agreement of 20th May, 1919, and tothe terms of other fl&amp;tiou&amp;i and Local agreements between the parties.3. Instructions of the Management snail be observed pending any question in connection therewith being discussed in acoordanue withthe Provisions referred to.2, OVERTIME  &apos;It la agreed that in terms of the Overtimeand flight Shift Agreement on 29th and 30thSeptember, 1920, the J&amp;aployers have the rightto decide when overtime is necessary, the work-people or tneir representatives being entitledto brinr forward under the Provisions referredto any cases of overtime they desire discussed.Meantime, the overtime required shall be pro-ceedea with.&quot;The above agree,:..-; -nt was recommended to their members for acceptance by the Amalgamated engineering union Executive.     it was, however, rejected on a ballot vote by 50,240 to 35.^25 votes out of a total membership of 409,000, - a poll of little more than20 per cent.
Controversy, Dr.Maenaiaara continued, has centredmainly around para.3, which provides that the instruc-tiona of the management shall be proceeded with pendingany question which the men desire to raise;    suoh questionsbein^ thereafter discussed in accordance with the pro-visions already in existence for the avoidance of disputes,which are referred to in para.2 of the above agreement.*t is the view of the men that such discussion saould takeplace, and agreement be reached  ripr to the carryingout of suoh managerial instructions, more especially assuch instructions might cover a wide field, including over-time on ordinary production.After the rejection of the Memorandum of November,1921, by the Ballot Vote, the federation gave notice on22nd February to the Amalgamated Union of the loois:--out to begin last Saturday.The Engineering Employers Federation then metseparately -on March 1st - the National Federation of general works,,       on March 2nd - the Federation of the Engineering and shipbuilding Trades,on March 4th - the National union of Foundry Workers.and requested them to accept the Memorandum.     Taesebodies adjourned to consult their constituent Societies.On March 7th the Amalgamated Engineering Unionmet tae Minister of Labour by invitation, and later he saw the representatives of the employers, and succeeded in arranging a Conference of the two parties on March 8th.Mo accommodation was reached, at tale meeting.On -a.reh 9th representatives of the national joint council of the Labour Party, the General Council of theTrades Union Congress, and the Parliamentary Labour Partywaited upon the Minister of Labour and stated that three
other bodies were involved, via:-the federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades;the National Union of Foundry Workers;   andthe National Federation of General Workers.These we e the three bodies mentioned above, which hadalready been asked by the Employers to accept the Memorandumof the 17th, and 18th November, 1921, though no look-outnotices had been issued in these three oases.     The repre-sentatives of the Joint Council had suggested that a fleeting between representatives of the four Unions tomeet Sir Allan Smith conjointly was desirable.     i&apos;his was arranged and the meeting took place on ^riciay, March 10th.On tais occasion the representatives of the Unionsinformed the Employers that, as trie subject in dispute between the Employerss and the Amalgamated engineering union had not been fully discussed between the Employersand the other Unions, the representatives of these unions were not prepared to recommend its acceptance to their members.     They were, however, prepared to take u ballotof their members without a reoomiftendation, provided tnat theEmployers would suspend the notices to the amalgamated engineering Union.     The object of this proviso was thatthe ballot might be conducted in an atmosphere free fromthe bitterness which was bound to accompany the sight ofthe Amalgamated Engineering members locked out.The Employerst however, were unable to agree to suspend the notices to the Amalgamated Engineering Union.After further discussion the taree other Unions, namely,the federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades, thenational Union of Foundry Workers, and the nationalfederation of General Workers, were informed on the night of friday, ^aroa 10th, and Saturday, -^arch 11th, bythe Employers Federation, as follows&quot;In respect that it has been represented on behalf of certain trade unions that thepolicy of these Unions as settled-;,by their-7-
member a is in contradiction oi&apos; the principlescontained in the memorandum under discussion end that on this account it is nu\/ possible forthe   iSxecutive Councils of these Unions tomaite u joint recommendation on the subject,the Federations agree tnat the Unions repre-sented by baa present deputation be allowedfourteen days for the purpose of ballot, the returns of the ballot to be in the hands ofthe Federations not later than the first poston 125th March, 1922.&quot;&quot;in the event of the ballot of any oi&quot; theUnions being against acceptance, noticeswill thereafter be given to the members ofsuch Union employed by federated firms thattheir services will bo dispensed with.&quot;On Saturday, March 11th, representatives of these three Unions met and deoideti to ballot their men onthe Memorandum of 17th and 18th November, 1921.Dr. Macn&amp;ia&amp;ra stated that the situation, as described above, would be raised almost immediately inthe House of Commons, where the Trades Unions1 easewould be Set forth by the Labour Party, and the question would be raised as to whether the Minister of Labourintended&apos;to appoint a Court oi&quot; inquiry.     This was thepoint on which the Minister of Labour desired theopinion of his colleagues.     On the one hand it was in-advisable to appoint a Court of Inquiry so long as theIssue of the ballot of the three Trades Unions referredto above Was in doubt,     On the other hand, Dr.yiaonaaaradid not conceal that a rapid increase in unemploymentmust follow closely on the present lock-out, and thatin some large industrial centres such as Barrow-in-Furness, Coventry, and Lincoln, whatever the result ofthe three forthcoming ballots, practically the whole population would be unemployed.     in these circumstances,and having regard to the fact that the amalgamated engineering Union and the other Unions had to a great extent exhausted their funds owing to the widespread
unemployment, the Minister of labour had felt ithis duty to warn tue Home Secretary of the possibilityof a serious situation, particularly in some of thelarger industrial centres, including those mentionedabove, where Communist agents had been active.Oil In reply to questions , the Minister of Labourstated that before the lock-out, 100,000 men hadbeen unemployed in the engineering trade.     To taeseanother 300,000 bad been added, from the ranks of theAmalgamated Engineering Union.     Whatever the result ofthe ballots, members of the other Unions referred to would rapidly fall out of work.     The net result wouldbe the addition of another million men to the twomillions already unemployed.     Tne slow hut steadyreduction in unemployment, which had already reached20,000 a week would be entirely wiped out.     The100,000 engineers who had been out cf employment beforethe look-out would at ill be entitled to draw their un-emplcyment benefit allowance, but this would not applyto the man locked out.In the course of the discussion it was   ointedcut by the Minister of Labour that paragraph b of theMemorandum of  Joveraber, 1921, which was the main point at issue between the employers and the Unions, summarisedwhat had been previous practice.     It was generally felt that in the parliamentary debate the Minister ofLabour   should avoid committing himself on the merits of the dispute, and should leave the employers repre-sentatives in the Hou^e cf Commons to reply to thein the disputeLabour Party.     Premature interference, particularlywhile the issue of the three ballots was in doubt,was felt to be inadvisable.
The Cabinet agreed  That the Minister of Labour shouldhave fall discretion to state thatat the present moment he was notprepared to grant an Snquiry, andthat he should take the opportunityto impress on the House of commons the serious set-back to unemploymentrecovery which must result from&quot; thecontinuance of this dispute.(5) The Cabinet took note of the following Conclusionsof the Committee of Home Affairs:-(a) Committee of Home Affairs Mo. 105, heldon February 33. 1922, at 4-15 p.m.:-(l) national Library for Scotland.(2) Increase of Rent, &amp;e., Restrictions Act.(3) Guardianship of Infants Bill.(4) Heat-resisting Class for Miners * Lamps.(5) Anglo-Persian Oil Gomoany (payment ofGalls) Bill.(b) Committee of Home -Affairs Ho. 106, heldon March 3ft 1928, at 11-SO a.nun-CD Juries Bill.   -(?,)- Representation of the People Bill.(S) Naval-Discipline Bill.(4) Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) ActsConsolidation Bill.(5) Employment of Children Act. 1903,Amendment (Scotland) Bill,&apos; 192,2.(6) Lighting of Vehicles at Night&apos;.(?)

Juries Bill. 1. With reference to H.A.O. 97, Conclusion 4, the Committee   Cfahad under consideration a Memorandum by the Home Secretary(CP. 3772) covering the draft of a Bill to amend the law withrespect to the preparation of J urors&apos; books.It was proposed that, in place of the separate Jury Lists whichit had been necessary to prepare under the Juries Act of 1825, theordinary register of ,electors should be used, the names of personsqualified as Jurors to be indicated by a special mark, the exactnature of which would be prescribed by Order in Council. Theexpense, even in the, present year, would be much less than underthe old system, and in subsequent years would be altogetherinsignificant.The Committee agreed To ajDprove the Bill and authorise the Home Secretary toarrange for its introduction in Parliament.representation of 2. The Committee had under consideration a Memorandum bythe People Bill. the Home Secretary (CP. 3766J covering the draft of a Bill to altercertain dates prescribed by &quot; The Representation of the People Act,1918,&quot; in connection with the registration of electors; to preventincreases in postal rates for printed packets being reckoned for thepurpose of any limit on the amount of the expenses of candidates at elections ; and to dispense with the necessity of a local enquiry upon an application for alteration of boundaries of any electoral divisionwhere such application is unopposed.(a.) Extending the Time for preparing the Register.It appeared from the Memorandum that &quot; The Representationof the People Act, 1918,&quot; prescribes the end of the qualifyingperiod for the Spring Register as the 15th January, and requires the Spring Register to come into force on the 15th April, thecorresponding dates for the Autumn Register being the Loth july and the 15th October. In consequence only three months wereavailable in either case for preparing and printing the Register.Experience had shown that four months were required, and hither to the period had been extended to four months by Orders in council under Emergency Powers, which, however, expired one year afterthe termination of the war.&apos; It was proposed to extend the period by the Bill to four months, by ending the qualifying periods on the15th December and the 15th June respectively.Reference was made to the fact that a desire had been expressedin some political quarters to substitute on the ground of economyan annual for a biennial register. It was suggested that the savingwould not be more than a quarter of a million sterling. TheCommittee were of opinion that it was unnecessary to take any steps in this directiou at present, and that the matter might be leftover for consideration in the future, should the occasion arise.Attention was also drawn to the inconvenience that might arise from the fact that under the Bill a new register would cOme intoforce in Great Britain on the 15th October and in Northern ireland on the loth December. It might therefore happen that if therewere a General Election it would be fought, so far as NorthernIreland was concerned, on a stale register. The Committee were informed, however, that the date (I5th December) had been fixed atthe request of the Government of Northern Ireland.The Committee accordingly agreed that the date should be leftas fixed in the Bill.(b.) To prevent the Increase of Postal Charges being reckoned asExpenses of Candidates at Elections.In order to meet the complaint that the increase of postal charges had seriously affected candidates at parliamentary and local
3. The Committee had under consideration a Memorandum bythe Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty (CP. 3707) covering the draft of a Bill to amend the Naval Discipline Act.The Bill dealt with a number of matters relating to naval discipline, of which the following were the most important: Under Clause 4, personnel of the Royal Navy serving inDominion ships or naval establishments would be placed under the laws of the self-governing Dominion in question relating to such ships or naval establishments.Under Clause 5, provision was made for revising the scale of, deductions which may be made from the paj^ of a seaman towardsthe maintenance of his Avife and children if he deserted them, ortowards the maintenance of illegitimate children, and for makingother subsidiary amendments of Section 98a of the Naval discipline act.The Rome Secretary drew attention to the provision in Clause 5,page 4, line 21, that process may be served, subject to any directions of the Admiralty, by being left with the Admiralty, and asked thatthe directions of the Admiralty should be actually ^inserted inthe Bill.The Committee agreed (1.) To approve the Bill and to authorise the First Lord of theAdmiralty to arrange for its introduction in Parliament;(2.) To request the Parliamentary Secretary to the admiralty to consider the point raised by the Home Secretary.Naval DisciplineBill.agricultural holdings(Scotland) ActsConsolidation Bill.[7960]4. The Committee had under consideration a Memorandum bythe Secretary for Scotland (CP. 3737) in which it was stated that aBill had been prepared in accordance with the pledge which hadbeen given by the Government in the House of Lords to consolidate the enactments relating to Agricultural Holdings in Scotland. AConsolidation Bill had been prepared, bat as it was pure consolida-tion it had not been thought necessary to circulate copies to theCommittee.B 2elections, whose expenses are limited by statute, it was proposedthat any expenditure by candidates on postage for printed packetsshould be reckoned for the purpose of such limitation as if it hadbeen incurred at the 1919 rates. Agents from the central offices of the four chief political parties had agreed to this.The Postmaster-General informed the Committee that, shouldthe Government agree to the proposals he was about to submitrelating to postal rates, this part of the Bill would automaticallybecome unnecessary and would therefore lapse.(c.) Local Enquiry upon an Application for an Alteration of the boundaries of an Electoral Division or the Number of electoral Divisions of a County.It was stated in the Memorandum that in all cases where anapplication is made for an alteration of boundaries a local enquiry was obligatory. Where there was complete local agreement noenquiry was, in fact, necessary, and it was therefore proposed, inorder to avoid expense, to dispense with an enquiry whenever theapplication was unopposed.The Committee agreed To approve the Bill and to authorise the Home Secretary toarrange for its introduction in Parliament.
5. The Committee had under consideration a Memorandum bythe Secretary for Scotland (CP. 3744) in which authority was askedto introduce a Bill in Parliament to prevent street trading inScotland by children who were trading on their own account withoutactually being in the employment of any other person. &quot; TheEducation (Scotland) Act, 1918,&quot; contained the following pro-visions : &quot; That no child or young person under the age of 17 shallbe employed in street trading.&quot;The Scottish Courts had decided that such enactment did notapply to children or young persons engaging in street trading ontheir own account without being in employment. It was suggestedthat there- was no reason to make any distinction in the case of suchchildren, and that the law should be amended by the addition tothe words quoted above of the words : &quot; nor shall any such child or young person engage in streettrading,&quot;and that a penalty should be provided in the case of contravention.The Chairman stated that he believed the law in England wasthe same, but that so far as he was aware the ppint had not beentaken in the Law Courts.It was suggested that in that case there ought to be a joint Billapplying to England as well as to Scotland.The Committee agreed  (1.) To authorise the Secretary for Scotland to arrange for theintroduction of a Bill in Parliament as suggested in his memorandum.(2.) That the Chairman should enquire whether similarlegislation was necessary in the case of England.Lighting of 6. The Committee had under consideration a Memorandum byVehicles at Night. the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport (CP. 3597)covering three Reports of a Departmental Committee set up by theMinistry of Transport to consider the regulation of- the lighting of vehicles at night.It appeared that the lapse of the Regulations in force duringthe war regarding the lighting of road vehicles had left the matter in a chaotic condition. The lighting of vehicles was now governedmainly by By-laws made by Local Authorities, with the result thatthe regulations in force varied in different parts of the country andeven in different parts of the same County. It was often impossiblefor a driver to know what Regulations were in force in the particular area in wdiieh he happened to be. The authority of the Committeewas asked to prepare a Bill to give effect to the recommendations ofthe Departmental Committee.The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transportstated that a Bill had already been drafted, but had not yet been circulated. The final form-of the draft was still under considera-tion. It was proposed in the Bill to make it obligatory upon thedriver of every vehicle to carry such white light or lights in frontas might be prescribed by the Minister of Transport and a redlight in rear. It was proposed to fix the hours of darkness betweenthe 1st April and the 30th September from one hour after sunsetEmployment ofChildren Act,1903, Amendment(Scotland) Bill,1922.The Committee agreed To authorise the Secretary for Scotland to arrange for theintroduction in the House of Lords of a Bill to consolidate the enactments relating to Agricultural Holdings inScotland.
until one hour before sunrise, half an hour being substituted for onehour in the winter months.It was proposed to authorise the Minister to make such ordersrelating to the construction and position of lamps as would ensurethe safety of traffic and prevent inconvenience to users of the road,such as that arising from the use of dazzling headlights. Upto the present no device against dazzling effects had been completely satisfactory, but experiments were continuing. Pro-visions were also contained in the Bill for the testing andcertification of lamps. Special provisions were made with regard tooverhanging loads, towed vehicles and a variety of other matters.It was believed that the question of a rear lamp for bicycles was theonly matter in the Bill which was likely to give rise to controversy.Cyclists were generally opposing the proposal, and were asking whether a1 single light showing white in front and red in the rearwould satisfy the requirements of the Ministry of Transport. that matter was still Tinder consideration the Committee were generally of opinion that a Bill such asthat indicated by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry ofTransport, containing clauses relating to a number of points of detail, would inevitably give rise to prolonged discussion in Parlia-ment. and that many minor points might prove controversial. Thepowers taken by the Ministry ol: Transport were very wide and related to a variety of detailed points of a technical character whichwould lead to considerable debate. The Bill must be considerablysimplified if its passage were to be secured.Attention was also drawn to the fact that under the Bill theMinistry of Transport would be able to change the rules relating tothe construction of lamps for motor-cars every few months, to thegeneral inconvenience of the motoring public It was also suggestedthat great objection would be taken to legislation by DepartmentalRegulations issued in virtue of the powers conferred by the Bill,that the new obligations as to lighting should be, so far aspracticable, embodied in the Bill, so that there would be full noticeof any change in the law, and that the powers to make regulations should be simplified and restricted accordingly.The Committee requested the Parliamentary Secretary to theMinistry of Transport to reconsider the form of the Bill inthe light of the above discussion, and to prepare a draft frr the consideration of the Home Affairs Committeeframed on lines which would give rise to the least possiblecontroversy.General Regulation 7. The Committee had under consideration a Memorandum by of Mechanically the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport (CP. 3598)Propelled Vehicles, on the question of the General Regulation of Mechanically propelled vehicles, in which it was stated that a Departmental Committee hadbeen sitting to consider the existing regulations relating to the use- of motor-cars, with a view to the introduction of a general method of regulation more. in conformity with the modern traffic conditionsthan the existing law.The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport statedthat the Departmental Committee had not yet reported, though hewas aware of the general tenor of their recommendations.The Committee agreed That the question should be adjourned&apos;until the Report of theDepartmental Committee was available.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,March 2, 1922.o

National Library i, The Committee had under consideration a, Memorandum byfor Scotland. the Secretary for Scotland (CP. 3684), in which it was stated thatan offer had been made by the Faculty of Advocates to hand over tothe Government as the basis of a National Library for Scotland thegreat library owned by the Faculty. In ordinary circumstances theSecretary for Scotland would have recommended the immediateacceptance of the offer, and the taking of measures to constitute theNational Library, but under existing financial conditions he did notdeem that practicable. The burden of maintaining the library, towhich the public were admitted, was no longer in the power of the faculty, and in view of the &quot;fact that the Government, if they accepted the offer, would have the right at some future date to takeover the library, the Chancellor of the Exchequer had agreed tomake an annual grant of 2,000 . to meet the most pressing needs ofthe library, and to prevent its deterioration.The Secretary for Scotland accordingly asked for authority tomake an intimation to the Faculty to the following effect : &quot; The Government recognise that the Faculty have formany years made their great collection available to the public for all reasonable purposes. They regret that in the present state of the national finances it is not practicable to proceedwith the transfer of the ownership and management of the library to the State. They greatly appreciate the Faculty&apos;soffer, and they regard the constitution of a Scottish NationalLibrary on the basis of the Advocates&apos; library as a highly desirable public object when financial conditions permit. they realise that the present owners cannot, without financialassistance, provide even for the necessary maintenance and useof the library, and are prepared to make an annual grant from. public funds towards the cost of upkeep and use. Subject tothe consent of Parliament, a grant of 2,000L will be provided under suitable conditions for this purpose.&quot;The Committee agreed That the Secretary for Scotland should make an intimation tothe Faculty of Advocates in the terms above stated.Increase of Kent, 2. The Committee had under consideration a Memorandum by&amp;c, restrictions the Minister of Health (CP. 3670) in which it appeared that aAct- notice to increase rent within the limits permitted by the Increase of rent Restrictions Acts is not valid unless preceded by, or accompaniedby, a notice to quit taking effect before the increase of rent came into operation. Many landlords had been unaware of this necessityand htid given notice of an increase in rent under the impression thatno notice to quit was required. The Courts having found that such notice of increase was faulty, many tenants were now refusing to paythe increase and were also claiming to be refunded the increasedrent they had paid. It was proposed to introduce a Bill, in theterms contained at the end of the memorandum, to make notice of increase effective without notice to quit and to prevent tenantsclaiming a refund. In the course of the discussion it was stated thatthe iVIemorandum was based upon the decisions of certain county court judges. Since the Memorandum was circulated, a decision hadbeen given in the Court of Appeal upholding these decisions. Oneof the Lord Justices of Appeal had pointed out that the additionalrequirement of a notice to quit was a perfectly useless formalitywith which he would have been glad to dispense had the language ofthe Statute permitted.The Minister of Health stated that it was difficult to judge towhat extent tenants had taken advantage of the legal technicality.
Guardianship of 3. With   reference   to   Cabinet   88   (&apos;2L), Conclusion  7,  theInfants Bill. Committee   had   under   consideration  a Note   by the Secretary(CP.-3749) covering a Memorandum by the Solicitor-General on theGuardianship of Infants Bill. This Bill was a Private Member&apos;bill, and the Cabinet had asked the Committee to advise what attitude the Government should adopt, to wards it.The object of the Bill is to make the mother joint guardian withthe father, and to give her equal authority, rights and responsibilitywith regard to the child. The Bill for the first time imposesliability upon the parents for the maintenance of the child accordingto their respective means.The Memorandum by the Solicitor-General gave a detailedcomparison with the existing law of the changes proposed by the Bill.The Memorandum also contained a note by the Registrar-Generalrelating to the consents required for the marriage of minors.The Committee had also before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Health (CP.-3719) in which attention was drawn to thelegal difficulties that would arise under the Bill as at present drafted,and a Memorandum by the Home Secretary (C.P.-3758) in whichobjection was taken to the proposal to give Courts of summary jurisdiction power to hear cases relating to guardianship.The Solicitor-General stated that the Bill had been originallyintroduced in the House of Commons in the preceding session, hadbeen given a second reading and had been cursorily examined in committee. It had now been reintroduced in the House of Commons.In the meantime Lord Askwith on the previous day had given notice[79241 B 2There were some 6,000,000 houses in the country where increasedrents had already been paid and no prior notice to quit had beenserved. If the tenants of all these houses were to claim a refund ofthe increase the position would be very serious.It was pointed out that the clauses of the Bill contained in theMemorandum would not operate retrospectively, but wrould only make a faulty notice of increase valid in future and at the sametime prevent tenants from claiming to be repaid the increases theyhad already paid. The landlords would not be entitled to paymentof increased rent for a period prior to the passing of the Bill whichthe tenant had refused to pay on the ground that no notice to quithad been served.The Committee were generally agreed that if any legislation were to be attempted it should be retrospective in effect.The Secretary for Scotland pointed out, on the other hand, that,while legislation, if any, should be retrospective, it whs questionable whether it was desirable to embark upon a further course oflegislation relating to increase of rent, which was wont to betroublesome in the House of Commons and would involve compli-cated and difficult debates. In Scotland the grievance was not soacute. There hud been a County Court judgment similar to thosein the English Courts, but lie had received no representations fromlandlords. He suggested that the Committee should make quite sure that the matter was so urgent as to call for legislation beforeauthorising the introduction of a Bill.The .Committee agreed That the Minister of Health should draft a Bill on the lines setout in his Memorandum, but with full retrospective effect,and should bring it up for consideration at a futuremeeting of the Home Affairs Committee should the exjDres-sion of opinion in Parliament be such as to show that therewas a demand for legislation.
of a Bill in the House of Lords, for which a second reading was setdown for the 1st March. The Bill in the House of Commons raisedvery difficult and complex questions. As women voters wereexercising great pressure in the mattes-, he suggested that it shouldbe read a second time and referred to a Select Committee, or if itwere preferable to proceed with the House of Lords Bill, that mightbe referred to a hybrid Committee. Some such step should be takenin order to show that the Government were . anxious to meetlegitimate demands so far as they could properly be adapted to theexisting law.Some members of the Committee were of opinion that referenceto a Select Committee would not meet the case. The delayinvolved in the proceedings before a Select Committee would be solong that the Bill would probably not survive.Sir Claud Schuster pointed out that a good deal of the bill was unworkable, and that when the Lord Chancellor in the House ofLords had to reply to Lord Ask with it would be necessary for himto have some guidance of the views of the Government on thegeneral policy of the measure. The principle of joint guardianshipunderlying the Bill had not been considered by the Committee, andthe Lord Chancellor should be informed whether the Governmentwere prepared to adopt that principle.The Committee agreed (1.) That a Sub-Committee consisting of The Home Secretary,The Minister of Health, andThe Solicitor-general should examine the Bill and should advise the HomeAffairs Committee- (a.) On the principle of joint guardianship under-lying the Bill ;(o.) Whether any, and which, of the provisions ofthe Bill could properly be supported by theGovernment.(2.) To suggest to the Lord Chancellor that in replying to LordAskwith in the House of Lords he should state : That aBill relating to the Guardianship of Infants which hadbeen introduced in the House of Commons was being-considered by a Committee of the Cabinet; that theGovernment were in no way committed to the principleof this Bill, but that in the circumstances it was unnecessary for the House of Lords to take time in considering Lord Askwith&apos;s measure.Heat-resistino- 4. The Committee had  before them  a Memorandum by theGlass for Miners&apos; President of the Board of Trade (CP. 3680) covering the draft of aLamps. Bill to enable the Board of Trade to refuse to approve any type ofilame-lamp containing an outer glass manufactured in Germany,Austria or Czechoslovakia, subject to their being satisfied that glassmanufactured elsewhere is available lor the purpose of such lamps insufficient quantity, suitable quality and at a reasonable price. Thepurpose of the Bill was to ensure the fulfilment of an undertaking-given by Mr. McKenna in 19 L4 and renewed by the Ministry ofMunitions in 1917 that no German or Austrian glass would be approved for a period of at least three years from the conclusionof the war. The object of the pledge was to encourage British firms to undertake the manufacture of these glasses, which are necessaryfor the carrying on of the mining industry, and of which  the war cut
off the main sources of supply. In consequence of this undertakingarid the exercise of continual pressure by Government departments on British manufacturers to increase the supply of such glass, theoutput was now quite adequate in quantity and suitable in quality.The pledge above referred to had been given on the strength ofsection 33 of the Coal Mines Act of 1911, by which no safety lampcan legally be used unless of an approved type. The Law Officersnow advised that the pledge was ultra vires the Coal Mines Act.Were German and Austrian glass to be imported, the price wouldbe about one-third of present prices and the result would be to killthe British industry.   The position was, therefore (1.) That the British manufacturers accepted the pledge in good faith, that the pledge has been continually used by theDepartments in pressing the manufacturers to increasethe supply of glasses, and that the manufacturers wereled to believe that the prohibition of German and austrian glasses would continue until the 31st August,1924.(2.) That the pledge was ultra vires, that the Government couldnot carry out its undertaking except by legislation, andthat the only alternative to this was to commit a grossbreach of faith.The Committee agreed- To approve the Bill in view of the very definite pledges that had been given by the Government, and to authorise thePresident of the Board of Trade to arrange for its introduc-tion into Parliament.Anglo-Persian Oil 5. The Committee had under consideration a Memorandum byCompany (Payment, the Financial Secretary to the Treasury (CP.-3753) covering theof Calls) Bill. draft of a Bill for the purpose of enabling the Government to pay upthe balance of 19s. a share on 1,000,000 shares of 1Z. in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company owned by the Government.The Committee agreed To ajDprove the Bill and to authorise the Financial Secretary tothe Treasury to introduce it in the House of Commons.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,February 24, 1922.
