THE RE,&apos;*mT OP       (l) With reference to Cabinet 7 (23.) , Conclusion 5, theTHE iCWITTEEON&quot; NkVIONAL EX- Cabinet bad under consideration the Interim Reports of hhoPBNDITUR? .Committoe on National Expenditure, two of which aro already in the hands of the Cabinet.The Lord Privy Seal reported that the Chief Unionist-Thip had strongly urged that the Government should announce-&apos;their intention to publish not later than when Parliamentmeets, and other instances were giver: of the strong publicpressure for the publication of these Reports, including aletter addressed to the Prime Minister by Sir Edwin Stockton,the Chairman of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce.The immediate publication of the Report without commentwas criticised, on the ground that public opinion wouldbecome formed and would harden on certain stereotyped lines,and it would be difficult later on to justify the reasons ofpolicy which compel the Government to depart in certaindetails from the recommendations of the Report.   Moreover,the credit for many reductionsswhich had in fact been madeby the Government Departments thesis elves, would be ascribedentirely to the Committee on National Expenditure.An alternative proposal was to publish, simultaneously with the Report of the Committee on National Expenditure,the comments arid decisions of the Cabinet thereon, based onthe Reports - of the three Cabinet Committees .It was pointed out, htowever, that if the Report were published, the strong support to the Government which mightbe expected from powerful sections of the community whoseinterests would be affected detrimentally if the Report were carried into effect in every detail, would be lost.    If, onthe other hand, the Government&apos;s decisions were publishedsimultaneously with the Reports, ths &quot;tfveroment would incur the whole of the odium involved in any possible decisionsagainst the adoption of particular recommendations.It was further pointed out that the Cabinet had notyet reached its decisions on the Interim Reports, and that
in!     i    il    I 101V before final decisions could be&quot; reached it might benecessary to consider the Reports as a whole,  including thasReports which are not yet available.After considerable discussion the Cabinet agreed  (a.) That the Report should bo- published andlaid as a Command Paper at the earllastpossible moment.    The Chancellor of theExchequer to be responsible for this action and for advising the Prime Minis-ter as to the nature of the announcement to be made by him on the opening of Par-liamert on the following day,(b) In making this announcement it should bemade clear in both Houses o^ parliament that the Government is not bound to adoptthe   recommendations of the Committee:(c) Th3 decisions of the Government should be announced as soon as practicable:(d) In the interim. Ministers should be free to take such steps as they might deer-advisable to rebut any reflections madeon their Departments by the Report.&apos;THE OUTBREAK (g) with reference to Cabinet 7 (22), Conclusion 3,OF FOOT ANT)MOUTH DISEASE.      the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries informedv - the Cabinet that 37-2 separate outbreaks of foot and&apos; . mouth disease had been reported, and of these -all except two had been definitely traced to a singleorigin.     The origin of the two exceptions had notyet been determined*     Sir A* Griffith-Bescawen- then&apos;referred to the&apos; two alternative policies, namely(I) A policy of stamping out by slaughteringinfected animals and those.in contact withinfected animals; by prohibiting allingress and egross:(ii) A policy of isolation and cure,Tho Minister of Agriculture stated that the formerpolicy had been adhered to by the British Governmentconsistently for 32 year;?    with the result that thecountry had boon kept clear of foot and-mouth diseaseat/
SETTNO OF (3)     With reference to the meeting of Parliament.IRLIAMENT.on the following day, the Cabinet discussed the linecatement oni) Government^     to be taken in regard to questions which wouldplicy inyypt. probably be put on the situation in Egypt and in India.Tho Cabinet agreed -That In the statements made to parliament it should be pointed out that pendingthe arrival of Lord Allenby, no finalannouncement of policy could be made:that in the meantime Papers were being prepared and would be laid on the Table;and that some general indication shouldbe added of our special position in egypt and the importance of safeguardingfundamental British interests.at a relatively small c^st.     It had been adoptedwith equal success In the United States ofAmerica,     The alternative policy, on the otherhand, had been adopted on the Continent of Europe,and in the case of France had last year provedboth costly and ineffective.Up to the present time the Ministry ofAgriculture had, in the course of the presentoutbreak, adopted the former policy (subject toa very slight modification in order to avoid the wholesale slaughter of valuable pedigree stockin cases where thorough isolation was practicable)at a cost of nearly  250,000 which might be doubledbefore the end was reached.In the course of the disctission it transpired that the present outbreak had been ascribed to the flight of birds, and that the whole country hadbeen scheduled by the Ministry of Agriculture andFisheries.The Cabinet agreedTq approve the action already taken bythe Ministry cf Agriculture and Fisheries,and to give the Ministeraisbretlon to continue that policy
b)Govern- (4) WltIbrreferenoe-tft C cabinet S (22), Conclusion 1, theeht&apos;s Policyn Ind-*7j* Secretary of State for India outlined the present situationin India with special reference to a communication fromthe Governor of Bombay recommending the arrest of Gandhion the ground of a series of seditious speeches delivered by him dating from July, 1921.   The Government of India had rejected this ground of arrest, and preferred to base it on specific acts of civil disobedience which Gandhi had beenurging on the&amp;eopls.   Gandhi had, however, postponed thedate of disobedience from January 31 to February 15.   Hehad recently issued an insolent proclamation which theGovernment of India were now considering.   So far back asDecember 15 he (Mr Montagu) had discussed with the Viceroythe undesirabllity of allowing the public discussion of .civil disobedience to proceed, and in certain provinces theAct forbidding seditious meetings had been put in force.This had not been done in Bombay and &quot;Madras, which at thetime were peaceful.   In the view of the Secretary of state telegram should be sent to the Viceroy stating thatinasmuch as    -    Gandhi&apos;s organisation exists for the purposeof overturning Government it should be suppressed, its meet-ing prohibited, and its leaders imprisoned or deported.While strongly in favour of the arrest of Gandhi, he was particularly anxious that instructions should not be con-fined to the arrest of one person.   He had telegraphed tothe Viceroy asking for a statement on the Indian situation,,for submission to Parliament, and, would like a Oabinet Com-mittee appointed to consider the present position.General regret was expressed at the delay which hadtaken place in arresting Gandhi, a policy which the cabinet had favoured more than three months ago.The Cabinet agreed --That the Secretary of State for India should send a telegram to the Viceroy on the lines indicated, after consultation with the PrimeMinister and the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs.

Objection was, however, taken by the solicitor-General who considered It undesirable on constitutional grounds to declare British ships on the high seas exempt from the authority of the Imperial GovernmentsStress was laid in the discussion cn the importance ofnot appearing to dictate to the Dominions in a matter of thiskind, and it was pointed out that by the Order in Council of1900, the Dominions had been specifically excluded and that infact, therefore, the Act of 1904 had not been applied to shipsregistered In the DominionsaThe Cabinet agreedTo accept in principle the amendmentproposed by the Colonial Office exemptingships registered in the Dominions from theoperation of the Wireless Telegraphy- Act-y1904.
