PF,nS^ (l)mth refWnC&quot; t0 0aMnet 11 (22)&apos; inclusion 1,     &apos;th* Cabinet opened with a preliminary discussion in regardto the line which Ministers speaking in their flons-tituenoiea- -.    and elsewhere should take on the subject of the economiesresulting&apos; from the Reports&apos; of&apos; the Committee on NationalExoerdi. ture.It was generally felt that Ministers should..no-t^ma&amp;a^public information, which had not yet been communicated toParliament.The view was expressed that recent losses of the coalition at by-electiohs were due to the fact that thosewho desired economies:feared the Government would not make them,..&apos; -while those who disliked the economies feared thatthey would.; For example, the proposed exclusion of children under six years of age from the schools was undoubtedlyexercising a deleterious effect in the constituencies;Th^re was general agreement that a statement shouldbe made by the Prime Minister at the earliest possible moment..setting forth the great aehieve:ments of the. Government in thefield of economy, stating how large are the. economies whichhave been effected by the efforts of Ministers, and removing&quot;the many misunderstandings which have, been propagated.    Sucha statement should show the general reduction in expenditure,th* saving on education, and a substantial saving in defence.Some, doubt was expressed, however, -as to whether thepolicy o^ the Government was sufficiently determined to-enable-such a statement to be made this week.The Cabinet agreed --That the Finance Cor-.rn.itte--  of the Cabinet&apos;.   should meet at 11 a,m. on WEDNESDAY, FEBRFARY&apos;,:;.&apos;&apos;$3nd, in order to take stock of the present* &quot;&quot;position and draft&apos; decisions as regards&apos; V .    economies, recommended in the Report of the&apos;&quot; \      &apos;.. -&quot;&apos; . Committee on National Expenditure, with a&apos;&apos;- &apos;.       view, if possibleri to a statement being made   .&quot;v;% by tho Prime Minister on Friday next on the\^.yV Third Reading of the Consolidated Fund Bill&quot;.(b) That the Treasury should prepare a preliminarystatenant&apos;for the consideration of this meeting .
;       j 143SiP^ r*fe^nc* to Cabinet 76 (21), Conclusion 10 (b) ,Appendix V, the Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the$ Secretary of State for the Colonies covering a draft treaty with. King Peisal in regard to the special relation of GreatBritain towards Iraq (Paper C .P.-S748) .This Treaty, which was the outcome of negotiationsfor three months between King Peisal and Sir Percy Cox, hadbeen considered by the Colonial Office,  in consultation withthe Foreign Office, and,  finally, by the Middle East. Committee,upon which the Treasury, Foreign Office, India Office, ColonialOfficej War Office,  and Air Ministry,  are represented.    Theonly outstanding clause was Article V, in regard to whichthr^e drafts were&apos; before the Cabinet.The first draft, proposed by King Feisal and provision-ally agreed to by Sir Percy Cox, subject to reference to HisMajesty&apos;3 Government, proposed that the Government of Iraqshould have the right of foreign representation.    This wasqualified by a provision that King Feisal should send hisrepresentatives direct to London and to such other places as might be agreed upon by tha High Contracting Parties.    In Stageswhere he had no representatives,  the interests of Iraq nationalswere to be entrusted to His Majesty&apos;s Government.The second draft, suggested by the Foreign Office, pro-nosed that Kinp Feisal should have an Agent to represent him.in London, but, that elsewhere abroad the British Governmentshould undertake the protection of Iraq nationals.The third, draft, proposed by the Colonial Office, follow-ed the lines of the Baghdad draft, with the omission of theprovision giving Iraq the general right of foreign representa-tion*All three drafts proposed that the King of Iraq should himself issue exequaturs to representatives of foreign powers in Iraq after His Britannic Majesty has agreed to their ap-^-pointment.The Secretary of State for the Colonies laid stress the importance of raising an Arab arrry capable of defendingsonotam^a   and stated that King Feisal insisted that, monMe
. - , 14order to achieve this, it was essential that he should not bea mere puppet monarch.    His point of view was supported bySir Percy Cox and the Colonial Office exports.    The import-ance of supporting King Fsisal:s prestige would be realisedwhen it was recalled that the British forces in Mesopotamiawere now reduced to 7 Battalions and the Air forces.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed theCabinet that Sir Cecil Hurst., the Legal Adviser to theForeign Office,- attached great importance to Feisal1s not having separate representation abroad.    He recalled thatGreat Britain was&apos; only a Mandatory in Ma sopot ami a.    The tend-ency, however, was to move away from the conditions of the .Mandate.   The draft mandate which had been submitted to theLeague of Nations by the British Government laid down speci-fically that the British Government would be entrusted withthe foreign, relations and diplomatic and consular repiresenta-tion of Mesopotamia, as well as the right to issue exequaturs.How was the change now contemplated to be justified to theLeague of Nations?    The League would wish to extend the samearrangements to Syria.   Was there any chance of France aecept-ing this?^e Secretary of State for the Colonies pointed out that where a deviation was being made from the terms of the draftmandate it was in the&apos;direction of a more liberal policy.The whole mandatory system had been devised to avoid thesupposed evils of acquisition by conquest., and the changescontemplated were all in the direction of the underlying ideaof the mandatory system...  .     .. .The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed in thegeneral proposition to establish King Feisal in a strong position.    Feisal&apos;s effort, however, did not depend onrepresentation abroad, which might give great trouble to ourselves.    France would never allow Syria to be representedabroad, in the same way, and the present difficulties between-r-
France and ourselves would be.accentuated.Mr Balfour, speaking as representative of the British: Government on the Council of the League of Nations,  did notconsider that there would be much technical difficulty inaltering, the Mandates, - an opinion in which Mr Fisheragreed,    Mr Palfour pointed out that&apos;the change contemplatedwas all.in the direction of-self-determination, and, that forthis, reason no objection wa-s; likely to be taken in the-Assem-bly..  The French Government, however, would abominate it. he agreed in the Colonial Secretary&apos;s view that the only.way todeal with Mesopotamia in the present financial position wasto give Feisal as large a measure of control as possible,  .though he did not know whether the Arabs had the stability toexercise ;Such control.   The Mandates would have to come before-the Council of the League, and the French would there be in aposition to block any change by their single vote. They would urge that their whole policy in Syria was absolutely-opposedto any such change, and that they could not consent&apos;to it;Mr Fisher, supporting this view, pointed out that at therecent Council Meeting the French representative had shownconsiderable reluctance to agree with us on any questlonaarising out of the Palestine Mandate under present circumstances*stances, and this-attitude appeared to. be due to the generalstate :of. relations between Great Britain and France,   Hethought.-that- the proper course would be to inform the Councilof the League that it was proposed to alter the Treaty, andthat in due course the British Government proposed to submit a fresh draft Mandate, brought into line with the Treaty.This would be done, and if the Council did not accept theMandate great pressure was likely to be put at the next .Assembly oh the Council to pass it,   On that occasion theBritifeh representatives&quot; could speak very -openly and explain the liberal attitude they were taking, in which case the pressure would probably be so-strong that any obstructionwould be overcome.
The Prime Minister pointed out that the international status of Mesopotamia was rather- dlf  eirent, from --that-r of. Egypt,which was a compact country which in the past had had Its ownForeign Office.   Mesopotamia,  oh the other hand-, was a merecollection of tribes.    The people of Mosul and Iraq,  forexample,: had never worked together.   Why-,&apos; he asked,, was itnecessary for them: to have, foreign representation at thisstage?    He felt that the Cabinet ought warmly to congratulatethe Secretary of State for the Colonies On the change he had&quot;effected in that region.    It was du-&apos;- to his sagacity andcourage that a policy&apos;had been evolved which had made it possible for us. to hold it.   Without&apos; this&quot;, policy it was pro-bable that we should have lost Mesopotamia, and he thoughtthat in the future this country might become of great import-ance to. the Empire&quot;.   He proposed that a reply should be sentto Sir Percy Cox that the Cabinet felt the greatest reluctancein agreeing - to the separate diplomatic and&quot;consular represent-a*ion of Iraq.until the State had become an established factand had made good;The Secretary of State for the Colonies felt that this wasto place an undue responsibility and-burden upon Sir Percy Cox.... The Secretary of State for War asked&apos; that&apos; his opinion might be recorded that he would agree to giving King Feisalthe..widest possible powers, as this would contribute towardsenabling- Great Britain to escape from the ebuntry with decencylater on, and he felt that In any circumstances It would beimpossible for us to continue&apos; to hold the country./After some further discussion the Cabinet agreed  That&apos;the Secretary of State for the Colonies&apos;should&apos; telegraph to Sir Percy Cox to - the effectthat the Cabinet felt the&quot;greatest reluctance in&quot;acceoHns: IrU proposals, for the separate diplo--    matio representation abroad of Iraq until theState had been.firmly established and until.King.. - Feisal had made&apos; gobd his position *   He shouldenquire how much importance. th-v High,Commissionerattached to this proposal from, the point Of viewof the maintenance of. King Feisal&apos;;s.prestige, and- -should report as soon&apos; as possible, with a view to&apos;   &quot;     -a final decision being, taken...   Subject to this^. .-   ------ Hhey authorised the Secretary of State forjtheColpnies&apos; to  proceed with the negotiation of a&apos;: Tfeatv oh&apos; t-he lines&apos; of the Draft.

THE iiftRD PRIVY SEAL stated that he had asked for ameeting of Ministers because he was gravely concerned about the situation in India.   The telegram   from theGovernment of India aa to the dangers and difficultieswhich confronted them was so wholly out of accord withthe suggestions now ma.de by them for the reduction of thetroops in India that he considered it desirable that theposition should be discussed by Ministers before theIndian Military Requirements  &quot;ommittee went further into these questions.    The difficulties of the Government ofIndia were in a. large measure financial.    To enable themto balance their budget it would be necessary to increasetaxation, and every increase of taxation would make thepolitical situation more difficult.   The Viceroy was anxious to make large reductions in the Military Estimates .In order to induce his Legislative Council to vote thebudget ho was anxious to be able to announce to them areduction of the British troops and acceptance of thepolicy of the Indianisation of the Indian Army.   He askedfor permission to notify a reduction of the British troopswithin a year, with a reservation that the Government ofIndia might be allowed to retain the troops temporarily -if the situation made it necessary.   Such a promise of reduction, subject to reservations, was of no use to theWar Office.   As regards the Indianisation of the Indian Army,the Government of India desired to.be allowed to announce the scheme set forth in his telegram No.. 11? of January 24,1922 (Paper 0.F.-3709), which provided for the total Indian-isation of the Indian Army in three stages of 14 years each.He regarded such a proposal as v-ry dangerous.    It was im-posaible to foreshadow a military programme extending overa period of 30 to 40 years.    It was impossible to foreseeevents more than one or two years ahead.   The proposals ofthe Viceroy were of a very formidable character;    and theyhad been approved by the Commander-in-Chief in India,
ffindi&amp;ns bail been afrcrded spportunitles to r3.se to anyposition in the Civil Government, but it must be rememberedthat it was to the fighting classes of India to which we^ipwed most.     Till recently they were not eligible for King!sCommissionSt,     He had been anxious to remove that racial barby granting King&apos;s Commissions to the few Indians who werecompetent to hold them     Hut the experiment of admittingIndian cadets through Sandhurst was not proving a success,as it was not easy to find candidates capable of passingtho Sandhurst or Woolwich examinations9 or of attaining thestandard required from British cadetSg and he saw no -justifycation in our experience to warrant this large new programme,At the time they were recommending reductions of the IndianArmyj the Government of India had sent &amp; telegram (Paper CcPc3715) foreshadowing various military situations they might haveto meet *     These included, firstly,, a war with Afghanistan;secondly, serious and widespoard conflagration amongst thefrontier Tribesj thirdly, sedition and disloyalty in thoIndian Army, involving mutiny in portions of that Armyj and,fourthly, Internal rebellion, consisting of simultaneousco-ordinated outbreaks In several placesa     They had statedwhat their requirements in roinforcements from England wouldbe in those contingencies.     They had also expressed theopinion that a mutiny of the Indian Army was not anticipatedso long as tho present proportion of British officers wasmaintainedaThe Government of Indians proposals for reductions of theArmy were not justified in view of their telegrams describing the general situation in india a:     He considered it desirablethat the Secretary of State for India should send a despatch to the Viceroy setting forth the views of the Cabinet on thesituation, and stating that in view of the telegrams- -    theyhad received regarding the situation in India they considered it impossible to approve any furtner reduction of the whitetroops, or contemplate any such scheme of Indianlsation as thatput forward by the ;jo-r -rwuit of InCin at the present time.
In the discussions qjP the Indian Military Roquirom&amp;nta flow-.    156mlttee it appeared that in the event of a war With Afghanistanthe first step would he for the British Army to advance toJalahad and the Government of India expected reinforcements to he sent from England to enable an advance to Kabul andKandahar to be undertaken.     At the present time tho necessaryreinforcements from England were not availableP and the plans of the Gove^rnment of India should be based upon that facto     Itwas undesirable, therefore, that they should contemplate theoccupation of Jalabad or Kabul,      It had been suggested thatOffensive action against Afghanistan should be tale n by meansof aerial bombing, but the views of the General Staff and theAir Staff on that question were irreconcilable.,      Opinion in theIndian Military Requirements Committee was tending to the viewthat military expenditure might be lessened by making full useof the Air Force, but the Government of India, without waiting to learn the views- of the Indian Military Requirements Committee^had announced their desire to reduce one of the two bombingSquadrons in India.     The whole position filled him with the. gravestanxiety,   and he felt that the Government of India were asking HisMajesty.&apos;s Government to take risks which they had no right to take.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA explained that the policyOf the Government cf India was that, having at least satisfied themselves that they had brought the thinking part of the popu-lation and the Councils to their side by a policy of patience,,they now proposed to take stern measures against the extremistsoThey hoped that these measures would greatly ameliorate thepolitical situation in India within the next few months.     Thejpresent financial position of India was appalling.     The nextBudget would cause a great sensation.      If the Government rejected the Viceroy&apos;s palliatives, it was certain that the Budget wouldbe thrown out, and that the Government of India would have touse the powers reserved to it to meet the financial situation , 50,000,000 of new taxation/
taxation would have tfl be raised.    It wae-prtyprva-^d toraise the Incore Tax, Salt Tax, and Customs and Excise,but these increases would all be opposed by the Council,&quot;he view expressed by the Indian Members of Council wasthat British trooos were too expensive for India, and that under existing conditions an expensive organisation and ahigh standard of efficiency were not necessary.    In 1920Lord Chelmsford had proposed to reduce the British troopsby 5 Battalions of Infantry and 3 Cavalry Regiments;Lord Raw1inson, however, had dissented, and the reduction was not made.    In 1921 the Viceroy had appointed a committee under the Chairmanship of Lord Rawlinson, to report uponIndian military requirements,   In the Report of that Com-mittee Lord Rawlinson recommended the reduction to whichhe had in the preceding year refused to assent.    Owing totheir unsatisfactory relations with Afghanistan duringlast year, the Government of India had refused to assent tcthat reduction, but stated that they would do so when condi-ltions were mf satisfactory.    The Government of India nowsought permission to inform the Council that the reduction could take place in a year&apos;s  time.   As Lord Rawlinson hadnot dissented, he himself would be justified in informingParliament that the proposal for that reduction had theapproval of the Corr-mand/pr-in-Chief in India.    There was,further, a proposal from the Gove.rnu-.ent of India for thereduction of one Borrbing Squadron.    Owing to the difficult position in which Lord Rawlinson was placed as Member ofthe Executive Council, the Government of India did not receive from hi)? purely military advice.   His militaryadvice was inevitably tempered by political and financial considerations.&apos;  He therefore discounted lord Rawlinson*military advice- in assenting to these reductions,   Mr MOJJTAGwas anxious, however, to be able to assist the Viceroy byassenting to part of his proposals, but he felt that to aliathe Viceroy to announce a reduction of British troops, as-4-    -
propped by him, would- be -toe hwuwlrii^he-Leg-ialLediiv^Council, because there was no reason to believe that thesituation in a year&apos;s time would be such as to enabie thatreduction to be carried out.   He therefore suggested theViceroy should be informed that he could not be authorisedto announce the proposed reductions of British troops.Aa regards Indianisation, he reminded the Conference thatwe had promised Indians to assist them to establish self-government in India.-   He would not be .a party to any newpolitical development until the Indians had shown that they knew how to make use of a Constitution that had been granted,to them.    The view expressed by many thoughtful Indiana wasthat they could never hope to govern themselves until theywere able to defend themselves.   They therefore asked us togive them opportunities of undergoing military training soas to render them capable of defending thomselves.   Thescheme of giving Commissions to Indians through Sandhursthad not proved a success.   That scheme aimed at providingofficers fit to take their place alongside British officers for service in all parts of the world.   Another difficultyof the present scheme was that it would res\ilt in Indiansbeing placed in command of Europeans.   The proposals now put forward by the Government of India avoided the difficul-ties of the Sandhurst training and the command of Europeansby Indians.If we announced that no further Indianisation of the India;Army would be made, the political situation in India would hgreatly aggravated.   The scheme now put forward by theGovernment of India had been worked out by the General Staffin India, and was approved in principle by Sir Claud Jac-otKHe himself did not think the Cabinet could safely approveeven the first stage of the scheme\   but he thought theymight tell the Viceroy that he might announce that the. schervwas going to be further considered.   He suggested that theSelect Committee of the House of Iord3 and House of Commons-5-
- on Indian A^aiJrs^mtght - examine^that s-cheme and make recom-mendations in regard to it in due course.THE SECRETARY OP STATE PGR FOREIGN AFFAIRS stated that although the strength of the Ars.y in India should be fixed on military grounds, the proposals now put foward by theViceroy aros- out of the financial situation,  and their object was to enable hiw to pass the budget.    The real testwas what was the best machinery by which the safety of india could be assured.    The experiment of training, Indian officers -to hold the King&apos;s Coi mission had not so far boon a success,The broad fact could not be disputed that the Indian raceshad not, as a rule,  shown aptitude for leadership or ambitionfor a military career.    The Viceroy contemplated a schemeundor which 1,139 Indian- officers would be required in 11years, ard nearly 7,000 in40 years&apos; time.   No such numberscould be obtained.   He did not believe that the demand for india.anis.tion represented a real desire on the part of thefighting races of India.    He believed that it was a politicalagitetic n.   He ivas^ opposed to the scheme put forward by theGovernor-nt of India, apparently as a sop to the Councils tosecure ehe passage cf the budget.   A more serious aspect ofthe question was that the Arr-y in India was essential to thesecurity ,and the good ad- inistration of the country.   Up to now the Indian Army was a highly efficient instrument, andits efficiency was due solely to the.British officers serving in it.    The young British officers in the Indian Arrry had shown extraordinary capacity for insp-ring the affection andrespect of their men.   He &quot;believed that the loyalty and theeff icier cy o r&apos; the Indian Army were bound up in the maintenanceof the British officers at their present strength.    In-a recent telegram the Viceroy had admitted that this was so.There was much disloyalty in India at the present ties.   an indian Army officered by Indians might be a very grave dangerif it turned against&apos;us.   He urged that a suggestion that hadbeen put forward by previous Viceroys should now be adopted,
namely, that instead of beginning with a wholesale evictionof the British officers, a few Regiments wholly officeredby Indians should be created.   The Indian officers enteringfrom the bottom would gradually displace the British officers.Such Regiments might be formed in selected localities inBritish India, and the experiment could be extended if it proved successful. - He was opposed to reductions of theBritish troops in India at the present time.THE SECRETARY OP STATE PGR THE COLONIES stated that inhis view the most urgent question in India was tho financialone.   India could not afford an expensive army or an expens-ive administration.    Owing-to n-w developments and tho rise of prices, the Army in India cost now two-and-a-half times as much as it did before theWar.   This was a heavy burdentto impose upon India.    He believed that the cost of theIndian Army might be reduced.    Before the &apos;-?ar the indian army was organised to meet an invasion by a formidable Russ&amp;narmy.    That contingency need.not at the present timo be takeninto consideration.&quot;   The military view at present was thatthe Indian Army should now be so organised as to enable it to invade Afghanistan and to advance to Kabul and Kandahar.He held&apos; the view that it would be madness to attempt to invade Afghanistan with land forces.   He considered that pressure should be brought to boar upon Afghanistan byaerial bombing.    If our Army were entangled in the mountainousregions of our frontier, the troops would not   be availableto keep order in Indi.a.   At the present time the first essential was the araintenance of internal order in India.Great changes had&apos; recently taken place, and nothing in thepast afforded a guide as to the present situation.    The indian army need not now be organised or equipped (1) to meet a russian invasion:    or (2) to invade Afghanistan;    or (.3) toundertake military operations in the mountain regions beyond our borders.   The main object of the Army in India today wasto maintain British supremacy in India.    If the organisationof the A1.....y was stud-ed or. that basis, be believed that
substantial economies could be- effected&apos;&quot;by -reducing the ancillary services,As regards Indianisation, he pointed out that indian states now possessed State forces 20,000 to 50,000 strong,which were loyal and efficient, and it was significant thatthe Native States had at the present time a more encouragingaspect than the Provinces of British India, with theirelected legislatures.   Personal loyalty to their Princeswas traditional in India, and ho believed that the Stateforces would be much more likely to be loyal to their Rajahsthan a regiment officered by Indians in British India to beloyal to a Legislative Assembly.    He believed it would be a mistake to officer Indian Army regiments in British india by Indians.He raised the question as to the position cf british rule in India.   An idea was prevalent among many people,both in India and at home, that ws were fighting a rearguardaction in India,       &quot;that the British raj, was doomed, andthat India would gradually be handed over to Indians.   Hewas strongly opposed to that view of the situation.    On thecontrary, we must strengthen our position in India.   Up to now the fruits of a policy of introducing democratic insti-tutlons into India was that the Indians had turned, against us at every stage, and they continued to make demands forfurther concessions.    He had supported the constitutional reforms in India, but he felt that they had received a greatsetback.   He believed that opinion would change soon as tothe expediency of&quot; granting democratic institutions to backwardraces which had no capacity for self-government.   He believedthat a way out of our difficulties might be found by extending the system of Native States, with their influential&apos;&quot;arristocra-cies and landed proprietors..&quot;   That system would be in harmony with the Ideas of Indians to whom European democratic insti-tutions were generally repugnant.THE LORD CHANCELLOR stated that, he was astonished atthe inconsistency of the messages which, the Viceroy had
recently addressed to His Majesty&apos;s Government. For instance in one message, in discussing the dangers in India, he had dismissed the possibility of mutiny in the Indian Army provided the establishment of British officers was maintained and sedition did not develop throughout the country, and in another message he proposed that the British officers, the guarantee of the loyalty of the Indian Army, should be withdrawn, although the political situation was becoming worse. The inconsistency appeared to him to be quite incomprehensible.

 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR pointed out that the proposed reduction of 5 Battalions in India, subject to the reservation that they might be retained, was likely to place the War Office in a difficult position. It would mean that the cost of 5 Battalions would be suddenly thrown on to the Imperial Treasury. If these Battalions and their 5 linked Battalions at home were reduced, the Government would be unable to provide extra troops for India if the Government of India asked for them in a few years&apos; time.

 THE L0RD PRIVY SEAL stated that his Committee on Indian Military Requirements was now enquiring into the question of the organisation of the troops in India. He did not believe that much saving could be effected by abolishing the divisional organisation, which was administratively economical; but he considered that some of the ancillary units of the divisions might be reduced. He suggested that in place of the 5 worthless Battalions which it was proposed to disband, 2 new Battalions officered by Indians, as proposed by Lord Curzon, might be formed as an experiment.

 THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF EDUCATION expressed the opinion that the economic situation was the principal factor in the Indian situation. There was also a widely diffused sense of grievance among Indians that they were not given equal opportunities for advancement. He agreed that the opportunities of taking up a military career would not be widely availed of, but he considered that opportunities should be given. Indians would prefer to enter the Service through an Indian College,
as they were plaoed at a serious disadvantage at Sandhurstand Woolwich*     He believed that the Establishment of an indian military College, with British Officers and Stafff would goa long way towards meeting the discontent Under this headsLORD LYTTON stated that there appeared to be two mainpropositions: firstly, the question of authorising the viceroy to announce further reductions of British troops, and?secondly, the question of Indian!sation of the Indian Army-He was strongly of opinion that it would be- inconsistent withour responsibilities to Parliament to authorise the viceroy to announce that further- reductions of the Army in India were contemplated,.     Such reductions would only be justifiable ifthe Government of India could show that the internal situation had substantially improved,     All their recent telegrams were.in the opposite senseeTurning to Indian!sa-tion, he considered that the Governmentwould be talcing a very serious step if they were to inform theViceroy that there was no hope of further progress as regardsIndianisation9     There were two matters about which Indians fe&amp;tdeeply *     These were their political status and racial di scrim-,ination.     The number of Indians vrtio cared greatly aboutdemocratic-forms of Government might be comparatively small but the racial question affacted every Indian, and it would be inconsistent with the promises that we had made to Indiato announce that no further progress towards Indianisationof the Indian Army could be made8     He trusted that theGovernment would allow some more definite announcement to bemade than the bald statement that the matter was under consid-eration.     He believed it would be safer to reduce the indian army in numbers while retaining its present high standard of efficiency than, to retain the present numbers and weaken theArmy by a measure of Indianisation applied to the whole of it9He was opposed to Indianisation by a process of leavening.He preferred Lord curzon&apos;s suggestion that Indian Regiments,officered by Indians, should be formed outside the Indian Army,If the experiment were successful it might be extended.He wa3 opposed to the reference of the question of Indian!-
sation to a Joint Ccumiirtee-ofwhs a jaa4yker*-of policy for which the Cabinet must &quot;be. -responsible ^&quot;They &quot;could not d?,lagate the decision on a matter of policy to aCommittee, but there world be no objection to the Committeediscussing the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government,   Ha sug-gestod that the Committee of Imperial Defence might considertho policy of Indianic at ion in connection with their enquiry-into the Indian tdlitary requirements.THE PRIME MINISTER read the following note by Sir Mauri.ceBankey of convorsations which he had had v*ith two -exports whoaccompanied Mr Sastri to Washington;    ons a soldier,  and theother a Civil Servant:-r&quot;They gave me the impression that these militarychanges are essential if we are to hold India atall.&quot; India., I gathered,  does not at. present ashfor separation, but will very soon bo l;-.d by agi-tators to demand it if we do&apos; not give a definitelead in the direction of Dominion Home Rule, in-eluding Indianisation of the Army.   The night I discussed these matters there was present a verybrilliant man named Rose, a former r-mber of theBritish Consular Service in China, who had lately been all through ndia on business, and he assuredme that this was the view of the younger and keenerCivil Servants and soldiers.   I don&apos;t profess toknowledge of this question, but I was profoundlyimpressed by these men.&quot;THE PRIMP *-;iNIST&apos;:R said that the drift of opinion of the Minis-tors present appeared to be clear.    Firstly, they were opposedto the- reduction of British troops in India until the situation onin India became more favourable..  The. outlook in India was nowgrave.    The information he had by every channel confirmed that view.   The question was whether the discontent was likely tocome to a head and to need the application of military force,-or whether discontent would continue to smoulder subject tosporadic outbursts like the recent/riots .   If an outburst was likely in the near future it would obviously be a mistake toreduce tho vrilita.ry forces now.    If a trial of strength came within the riert few months and the Indians were shown that anattempt.&quot; to overthrow the British c-ov-mment in India was doomedto failure, a reduction might then be possible.   He had been impressed by the demorailsation of opinion among the CivilServants and the members of the European cosmrunity.    This heattributed to a general doubt as to what was the policy of Fis
hall Gardens, S.*&quot;.l,ebruary 9, 1922.Majesty&apos;s Government.   The view that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentcontemplated withdrawal fro::; India seemed to permeate theCivil Service, and there was a general, feeling that opinion in a contrary sense could, not he expressed frore f-er of dis-encouragement from above.    That was a very tins at is factory situa-tion,   A reduction of troops at the present tire co-aid not fail to deepen that impression and have a bad moral effect.    Thesame impression was to a certain extent prevalent in England,where there was a general feeling that we were weakening ourgrip upon India.-  As regards Indianisation, it was clear thatthe scheme sanctioned during the War was not- proving success-fill.   An Indian Army officered by Indians would be a muchgraver danger in the event of a mutiny than the present indian army.   He was desirous o&quot;* being helpful to the Viceroy, butfound it difficult to   ake alternative proposals.The trend of opinion of the Conference was  (a) That no announcement o&quot; a reduction of theBritish troops in India, immediately or inthe future,  should be made;(b) That the Government of India&apos;a scheme for theIndianisation o &quot; the Indian Army could not hosanctioned at present in the light of inforr-a-tion received from the Government o&apos;r India asto conditions in India,  and in view of the factthat the Viceroy had stated that  the loyalty of*! the Indian Amy d^o-nrP^d upon the retention of&apos; the present proportion o&quot;r British officers.THE SECT^-EARY 0? STATE FOR INDIA requested that ther-* rightbe a further consideration of the state of India by the Confer-ence before Tuesday next, when there will he a discussion on india in Parliament.   He proposed to lay before the conference the draft of a telegram which he proposed to send to theViceroy.

Ambassadorwith&quot;regard to the Genoa Conference.     He&apos;had pointedout to the Ambassador that the&apos;French Note was susceptible to two possible interpretations.     First, it might merely beregarded as expressing legitimate doubts as to the meaning
of the re^tol*ifoJbGB*^^ th , -. and second, it might he regarded as an attempt to prevent the genoa-Conference taking place.     The French Ambassador hadtmh.esitatihgly.1 rsplled that the first interpretation was thocorrect one and that the French Government had every inten-tion that the Conference Should take place.     Moreover, hehad insisted that as the two Governments were so closely concerned in calling tho Conference together,&apos; it must not he allowed to fail.      Consequently, adequate preparations must be madea     Lord Gurszon had then pointed but that the pro-posed postponement for three months would he regarded     byt-hp world as postponement sine die, and he did hot think theBritish Government could possibly entertain the suggestionoHe had further pointed out that the actual fixing of thedate rested wiih the Italian Government; which was conveningthe conference and that up to the present time; notwith-standing the fall of the Government and the failure to forma new Goverameni, the Italians-had shown no disposition to postpone.     He had admitted, however, that&apos; if further delayoccurred in the formation of an Italian Government, some slight postponement might become inevitable-.     On the french ambassador&apos;s observing again that the French Government hadevery intention of participating in the Genoa Conference.Lord Curaon had Suggested that perhaps the best plan would hefor the French Government, to ..send, over experts to discussdetails with, the British Interdepartmental Committee whichhad been considering the Agenda.     (Lord Curzonrs letter toLord Hardinge,describing the above convocation, will hecirculated)*JESUS PRBfljfl MLJISTjSR /said he thought that Lord Cursonrsplan to inyite the French to send technical,-experts to london for a discuss ion, was an extraordinarily good one.
3jCBB GDRSOil said that the views he had expressedwere not merely his own, &quot;but those of his Office and the interdepartmental Committee, all of which had reached theconclusion that the French criticisms of the resolution of January Sth were bona fide.     He repeated that Li. Sainte-Aulaire had insisted that M.poincare did not wish to wreckthe Conference.,TEH ERIliiiJ MlLiloTiik agreed that it was unlikely thathe had any such desire-     He invited lord Curzonrs attentionto an interview with Hadek   which had been published ina ;       -several,   of the newspapers on the same morning, the gist ofwhich was to suggest a rapprochement between Russia andFrance in order to avoid Russia falling into the hands ofthe Germans.  .  This was evidently directed towards theFrench and it would obviously be to France^ interest to respond to this ovemuret, of id CURZOB undertook to read the account of the inter-view.     He thought it was not unreasonable that, the french should wish very carefully to examine the resolution ofJanuary 6th, which had only been drawn up in very general terms.     If the circumstances had been reversed and the drafthad been a French one, we should have subjected it to thesame scrutiny.     He proposed to see the French Ambassadoragain and confirm the invitation to the French Governmentto send experts to discuss with the British InterdepartmentalAgenda Committee.     The latter thought tnat it could givea satisfactory reply to the majority of the points raised in the French Hots.During the meeting the Prime Minister received a message from M.Krassin. stating that he was leaving for russia next Monday and asking for an interview.that -THAI LORD PRIVY Sjial urged/the. Prime Minister should be accompanied by Lo rd Gurzon when he s*&amp;t Mt,Ivrassin0
 LORD CURZON pointed out the difficulty that M.Krassin was only a trade commissioner and was not accredited as a diplomatic representative.

 THE PRIME MINISTER said that his intention was to make it clear to M.Krassin that it was not much use the Soviet Government sending representatives to Genoa unless they were prepared to accept the conditions of January 6th.

 LORD CURZON then agreed to accompany the Prime Minister when he saw M.Krassin that afternoon.

GENOA CONFERENCE.

 THE LORD PRIVY SEAL then raised the question as to how the Italians should be treated in regard to the proposed conversations between the British interdepartmental committee and the French experts.

 SIR MAURICE HANKEY said that M. Giannini had approached him, had stated that immediately the Italian Government was formed he was to proceed to Rome, and had begged to be informed as to the general views of the British Government towards the Conference.

 THE PRIME MINISTER thought it advisable that the Italians should be kept closely informed.

 LORD CURZON said that in the circumstances he thought it would be as well that the Italians should be asked to participate in the conversations with the French experts.

 The conclusions of the discussion may be summed/up as follows :-

 (a) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should invite the French Government to send experts to London to discuss the questions raised in M.Poincaré&apos;s Note with the British Interdepartmental Committee on the Agenda;
(hi/ The Secretary 0f SWb-e for Foreign Affairs&quot;&quot;&quot;^should also irrrlte- tho Italian   Governmentto nasin experts tp partd-participate in this discussion;(Mote:. In a sub-sequent conversation withthe Secretary;.

The attention of the. Ministers present was invited to a. Note by lord Beatty covering anAdmiralty Memorandum in regard to the cancellation of &quot;contracts for four Battle cruisers ordered late in 1921 - (CP-.3663] .It was agreed:-(a) That the Admiralty should proceed -on. the assumption that theWashington Agreement will be ratified and that the four battle cruisers should consequently be cancelled;(b)&apos; That there is no objection to theAdmiralty at once cancelling theorders for the hulls and machineryfo r the four ships -(c] That as regards gun-mountings,guns and armour, there is no.objection to the Admiralty proceed-ing with preliminary negotiationsfor the substitution of orders forthe requirements of the two smallerShips in place of the orders already given for the requirements of thefour.battle cruisers, providedthat they should not in any waycommit themselves in regard to thenew orders, without Gabinet decision.kjil-GKEJiAT-ION- OPJDNT.RACTS FOR FOURSkTTlJS&apos; CEUXSKRS..Whitehall Gardens, S.W./110th February,1922.

With .reference to Conference of Ministers held ontho 9th February, 1922, the SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIAredd a draft of a Telegram which he proposed to send to the Government of India0THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS suggestedthat some sentences should be added to the telegramtreating the matter from the wider point of view^, that isto say^ pointing out that the Government of India:sproposals for Indianisation. were net consistent with themaintenance of British ascendancy in Indiac      If theseproposals were given effect to, our military positionin India would be permanently irapairedc      The establishmentof an Indian Army officered by Indians would be a challenge to our rule in India, and we had no intention of surrender--ing it.THE PRIME MINISTER consumed,      He said that he felt the Viceroy was in a very difficult position,.     It wasnecessary that they should take steps to strengthen theGovernment of India by sending out to the Viceroy three orfour first rate men to take a place on his Councils      Hewould like a Committee formed of Members of the Cabinetto consider that question and to make recommendations for strengthening the Government of Indiac     Their proposals-should be sent to the Viceroy,.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA stated that he had .written in that sense to the Viceroy two weeks agoD     He,- had suggested to him that It Would probably be iiselsss for himto seek for suitable men in India,  and that any proposals he might make for strengthening his Council would have thesupport of His Majesty^ Government,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES expressed theopinion that the Viceroy ought to have by him four cr fivemen of the calibre of Cabinet Ministers *o would constitute an Indian Cabinets      It would not be necessary for them tohave Indian experience.THE PRIME MINISTER/
1/3THE PRIME MINISTER   expressed a wish that a CabinetCommittee consisting of the Secretary -of State for India,the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the Secretaryof State for the   Colonies, the President of the Board ofEducation and Lord Lytton should advise as to the stepsto be taken to strengthen the   Government of India0THE PRIME MINISTER referred to the remarks madeby Sir Claud Jacob before the Indian Military requirements committee on the 10th February,,     Sir Claud&apos;s statement that he understood the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwas ultimately to hand over India to the Indians and surrender British rule In India was evidently made in allsincerityc     It was necessary that that false impressionshould at once be dissipated.     A conviction that his majesty&apos;s Government intended ultimately to withdraw from India had now permeated through the whole of theBritish community in India, commercial as well as official,who viewed proposals for the Indianisatlon of the indian army with resignation as necessary steps in giving effectto the policy of ultimate withdrawals     It must be made clear that the Government had no intention cf   leavingIndia or of allowing British supremacy there to be challenged,A considerable measure of self-government had been grantedto india but any further extension in that ^direction must depend on whether the Indians showed that they were capableof making proper use of the constitution that had beengranted to them.. There must be a master in India *   Withouta master Indie would relapse Into anarchy and chaos..    Wewere now masters in India,, and we should let It be under-stood that we mean to remain so.../He
He thought It was desirable that a sentence should be added to the telegram to the Viceroystating with all possible emphasis that HisMajesty&apos;s Government had no intention of allowingBritish ascendancy in India to be challenged.It was agreed that the Secretary of Statefor India and the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should confer as to the drafting of the telegram to the Viceroy.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W,11th February, 1922,

 1. With reference to H.A.C.97, Conclusion 1, the Committee had before them a Memorandum by the Minister of Health,  (C.P.3694) regarding the position created by the recent action of the Poplar Board cf Guardians in granting excessive and illegal poor reliefs. The Memorandum pointed out that the Poplar Board of Guardians would be unable to charge on the Common Poor Fund any expenditure in excess of the prescribed scale; and secondly, that in so far as the relief given by them exceeds their legal powers, the expenditure would not be a lawful charge even on their local rates. The Guardians were, however, about to apply to the Minister of Health for sanction to a further loan, and it was explained to the Committee that before sanctioning this loan, the Minister proposed to require the Guardians to adhere to a reasonable scale of outdoor relief, and to reduce their expenditure in other directions. If, however, the Guardians refused to accept these conditions, there would be a deadlock in administration. A similar situation had arisen in regard to the Bedwollty Board of Guardians, and the Minister of Health considered it necessary to obtain statutory authority to suspend Boards of Guardians, and appoint an administrator vested with the full powers of the Guardians, including the power of charging his expenditure and the cost of administration on the local rates.

 Some reference was made to the procedure in Scotland where, it was alleged, the Scottish Board of Health had authority to carry on local administration in the event of a similar situation arising.

 The Committee agreed -

 To request the Minister of Health to examine the question further in consultation with the Scottish Office, and to cause, a Draft Bill to be prepared for consideration at the next meeting of the Committee.

Committee had before them a Memorandum/by the HomeregardingSecretary     /       the Children of Unmarried Parents Bill -a     private memborsr Bill which was before Parliamentlast Session.      In this Memorandum the Home Secretaryexpresses the opinion that a short Bill, providing forthe leglfimat-iby subsequent marriage of Illegitimatechildren should be introduced by the Government-^   It/&apos; ^
It was explained to tho Committee that one sugges-tion was that leg-Itiraationsbould. only take plaoc if tho-parents had been in a position to marry at tho time of birth.     The objection to this was that the Bill wouldbe a measure directed entirely towards protecting the child, and that the question whether the parents wereor were not In a position to marry at the  time of birth,was beside the point.General agreement was expressed with this viewsalthough&apos;it was pointed out that in Scottish law therewas a limitation depending on the question whether the parents had been in a position to marry.It was pointing out that the drafting of.the bill would require great care, as difficult questions,   suchas that of the effect of legitimation on titles ordignities,  would arise.The Committee agreed -To authorise the Howe Secretary to draft a Bill on the lines suggested for further consideration by them.4* The Committee had before  them a Memorandum by theFinancial Secretary to the Treasury (CP.3662),  statingthat under the Sudan Guarantee Act,  1919, the treasury were authorised to guarantee a loan to be raised by theSudan Government ^ part of the money being allocated tothe Gezireh Dam, and part to the Tokcr Railway.
