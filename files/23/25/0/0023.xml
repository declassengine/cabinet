PAH^AMENTATTf       (1) ^ attention of the Cabinet was called to the factPROCURE.     that on the - previous evening the Liberal Party Opposition had deliberately broken the pre-arranged order of business in theHouse of Coor..ons, in defiance of longstanding Parliamentarypractice.After verifying the facts by a reference to Hansard,the suggestion was made that the attention of Mr Asguith shouhformally be drawn to the matter.The decision was left tea the Prime Ministerand the Lord Privy Seal.IRELAND. (2) With reference to Cabinet 38 (21), Conclusion 9,  theProposed Prime Minister read to the Cabinet Memoranda, received shortlyTemporaryCessation      before the r^eetinp, of the views of the Chief Secretary for of military activity.        Ireland and his principal Civil and Military Advisers, regard-lng thr suggestion for a truce (a term which the Chief Secre-tary,  like the Cabinet on the previous day, deprecated) or temporary cessation of military activity in Ireland.The Cabinet were reminded that the Elections in Irelancwere to take place on the following day, so that the opportunity-nity to declare, a cessation of military activity for theperiod of the Elections had passed.After an exhaustive review of thr closely-balancedpolitical and military considerations involved, during whichpowerful reasons were adduced both for and against the pro-posal, the Cabinet reached the conclusion, by a majority  That it would be a mistake for the Governmentto take the initiative in any suspension ofmilitary activities in Ireland, and that thepresent policy in that country should be pursued.IRELAND. (3) With reference to Cabinet 27 (21), Conclusion 2  (d) ,Need of Pro- during the course of the preceding discussion the Prime Minis-&quot;asrardn .tor, alludincr to the need for further propaganda in GreatBritain regarding affairs in Ireland by Members of parliament in their constituencies, through the Press, and by leaflet,suggested that the following points ought to be emphasizedand should be rendered available in a convenient form to everMember of Parliament:-
(a^ The nature and extent of- the powers con-$ ferred by the Government of Ireland Act- on the Irish Parliaments:(b) The fact that Sinn Pein was conducting apolicy of murder because it declined toaccept the above powers:(c) The fact that Sinn Pein was murderingcivilians who were innocent of any crimeoth^r than that  (to Sinn Pein) of beingProtestants or ex-Service men.The Secretary was instructed to bring these proposals to the attention ofthe Chief Secretary.THE WHITSUNTIDE    (4)  The Lord Privy Seal brought to the attention of the holidays.       Cabinet a Question to be addressed to him in Parliament; asEffect of strike. to whether a sufficient number of Ministers would be ayail-ahl* to deal with any question of urgency that might arise in connection with the strike *After a short discussion, during which it was men-tioned that indications wore unfavourable for a reopening of negotiations for a settlement of the Coal Strike during the holidays, and that the balance of evidence went to show thatthe orospeets of any general extension of the Strike to thePailwaymenJand Transport Workers were less grave than had atone time been anticipated, the Cabin-t agreed -That the Lord Privy Seal should reply to theeffect that Ministers would be available as required for the performance of their duties.FOREIGN COAL.        (5) The attention of the Cabinet was called to a disputeDispute at     which had arisen at the Greenwich (London County CouncilGreenwich(L.C.C. Tram- Tramways) Power Station in. connection with the landing and use*ays) power station. of foreign coal, as set out in a Memorandum by the Minister ofLabour (Paper C,7-.-2935).   &quot;The matter was left to be dealt withby the Supply and Transport Committee.KEWBsqRS&apos; (6) &quot;;ith reference to Cabinet 38 (21), Conclusion 1, theEXPENSES,Cabinet were informed by the Lord Privy Seal that, in conse-quence of the misgivings f--lt by supporters of the Governmentin regard to the decision as to the remission of Income Taxto Members of Parliament, he had, on the initiative of the
OS? OFFICEINAWCE.Chancellor of the Exchequer and after consultation with thePrime Minister, announced in the House of Commons that hewould postpone action in regard to exemption from IncomeTax until the House had pronounced on the matter, and he had undertaken not to put the Whips on.The Cabinet endorsed the action of the lord privy Seal.(7)   With reference to Cabinet 14 (21), Conclusion 11, theCabinet approved the Report of the Cabinet Committee on PostOffice Finance (Paper CP.2932), the principal recommendationsof which were as follows : -(a) That the rates on foreign letters should be increasedto 3d. for the first ounce plus I-Id. for eachadd11 ional ounce,(b) That on letters proceeding to the British Empireand the United States of America, the charge for thefirst ounce should be 2d.  (as at present) and lid.for each additional ounce,(c) That the rate on foreign and colonial printed papersshould be raised from ^-d. for two ounces to Id.for two ounces.(d) That the charge made for British services in respectof parcels proceeding to the Colonies and foreigncountries should be raised from an average of lOd,per parcel to an average of Is. 6d. per parcel,(e) That the rate on inland postcards should be raised from Id. to l^d.(f) That the rate on inland printed papers should beraised from -Id. to Id. for the first ounce, therates for higher weights remaining as at present.(g) That the minimum charge for registration feesshould be raised from 2d. to ode(h) That the Postmaster-General should be authorisedas scon as possible to abolish Sunday collectionsand deliveries.As regards the annoxmcement of the changes proposed,the Committee had recommendedThat the Postmaster-General should be authorisedto announce, on introducing the new rates, thatthe Government recognise that when costs arereduced the user of the postal services is entitled;to get the benefit, and that such reductions as are possible In the rates now imposed,will be made as soon as a surplus on the PostOffice balance-sheet is assured.
n p o/dobThe Cabinet further agreed  That the Postmast^r-G-eneral should givefavourable consideration to the proposalto arrange for the acceptance of expressletters at the Central Post Offices of thelargs towns during stated hours on Sundayfor delivery in London or other large townson Monday morning.The Cabinet took note of the statementof the Postmaster-General that, owingto the depression in trade and to thefact that the savings proposed would operate for only a part of the financialyar, it had been necessary to make pro-vision for a possible deficit in excessof the  3,500,000 originally estimated.ZONALJRA1ICEOSS OPCROWN)L.(8) With reference to Cabinet 34 (21), Conclusion 2, theCabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer (Paper C0P,-2936) in which it was suggested that theapprehensions  felt by the Cabinet in regard to the die affectionwhich would be created by a public discussion in the Houseof Commons would be largely,  if not entirely, overcome by theissue of a Treasury Order und*r Section 41 (ii) of theUnemployment Insurance Act, 1920, reducing the number ofcontributions to be credited to each man on his dischargeat the end of the emergency from 90 to 24, which would provide4 weeks&apos; benefit instead of 15.    The effect of such an order would be to reduce expenditure on Unemployment Insurance from 1,400,000 to  400,000.    The Order would be published in the&quot;Gazette&quot;, but would not have to be presented to Parliament.Administrative arrangements could be made to meet the excep-tional cases of regular soldiers, sailors and airmen dischargedduring the period in question.After reviewing the whole position, with special reference to cases of men who on discharge would be out,or almost out, of benefit, and yet unemployed, and to thepossible charge of breach of faith which might still be made against the Government, the Cabinet agreed --To reaffirm their previous decision notto proceed with the National Insurance(Forces of the Crown) Bill,and to reject the alternative proposal to proceed by treasury Order.

Ifes &quot;possibilitySGllectiag a tax en Gtermaaexpofts in theUnited Kingdominstead of inGermany.1.     The- PiJJLME&quot;l IaTIS^^ reason for--summoning this meeting.A new proposal had &quot;been made at the AlliedOanfe ranee an Reparations &quot;by Germany (I.G.P-195,Appendix, Paras. 8(2),  and 10), for the imposition ofa tax of 25% on all German exports, which was to beeollected in Germany, in the form of foreign Bills,or some approved foreign currency.     He himself, however,felt strongly that the British nations would be moreassured of obtaining their share in reparations if thecollecti&amp;n were made in Great Britain on the linos ofthe 50% sanction, than if it were made in Germany.There appeared to he two alternatives :-*   f a) To continue to  collect the 50% of GermanIExports or some lesser percentage,  sinceIthe German Reparat ion. Recovery Act put50% as a maximum;    or(b) To propose a uniform 25%.The total to  be raised was 22% on the totalreparation furnished by Germany,  that is to say,  22%on  100,000,000 per annum, plus 22% on the 25$ raised on German exports.Tha object of the meeting, the Prime minister  explained was to consider whether it was administrativelypracticable to  collect the money here,   instead of inGermany.The suggestion was made that the Germans mighttry to force up prices against us.     It was pointedout, however, that the Germans would have to pay the25% in any ease.     It was immaterial to them whetherthe sum w^.s collected in Germany or abroad.It was/
&quot;$here       -B^m^dijsc-uflaion jxb to the-difficultiesof preventing-evesion of the tax by Germany by sendinggoods through Holland or other neutral countries, noton through Bills of Lading, but by consigning to neutralmerchants and manufacturers *The general trend of the discussion went to showthat the collection of the tax on German imports in theUnited Kingdom, Instead of as an export tax In Germany,was administratively practicable,The Prime Minister invited the experts to givo careful considerationto the question, after which the Presidentof the Board of Trade and all the expertsexcept Sir Basil Blackett withdrew.the blockade was practicable, its application would arousepublic opinion on behalf of the women and children, whowould suffer under it.It was generally agreedThat the Blockade should be held Inreserveand should not be resorted to until some experience of the Ruhr occupation (ifundertaken) had been obtained:Further, while the attitude of the minorneutral countries might not bo of greatimportance, It was essential to be assuredin advance of the attitude of the UnitedStates and of our legal position before putting the blockade Into force.IMPOSITION 2,OF BLOCKADE.The Conference briefly discuseed the application ofa blockade of German portsIt was pointed out that while% r .Whi teha 1,1 Gardens ,3rd May, 1921.
^CONCLUSIONS of a Conference of ministers held at 10, Dovmlng Street, S.\7,, on Wednesday, 4thMay, 1921, at 12 Noon.PRESENT:-THE PRIME MINISTER    (In the Chair).Tho Rt.Hon* Sir Robert Home,G.3.E,, K.C., M.P., Chancellorof the Exchequer.the following were also present:-The Rt.Hon. Lord D!Abernon,G.C,k.G., Oritish ambassador in Berlin.Sir J. Bradbury, G..U.B,,British Representative on the reparations Commission.LtcCol. Sir M.P.A.

G3F01N HSPAH- THE PRIME MINISTER explained that the latestiTTQSS.difficulty -viis as follows.     The &quot;Arrangement   for theAttitude of&apos; the Reparation   discharge of Germany13 liability under the Treaty ofC ommiosioii.Versailles&quot;drawn up at the present Conference in Londonpossibleprovided a /alternative to the schedule of payaaent to bedrawn up by tho Reparation Corrals si on under Article 233of the Treaty.     This new &quot;Arrangement&quot; however would bemore favourable to the Germans than the schedule which theReparation Commission was likely to forward.     m* Briandhad explained that from a political point of view, in thepresent state of French politics it would be extremelydifficult for hiia to defend the adhesion on the part ofwhich aopearedthe French Government to a scheme/less favourable to theAllies than that prepared by the Reparation Commission.The difficulty could be surmounted if it were possiblefor the Reparation Comsiission to adopt the London schemewhether as an alternative to the Reparation Commission1sscheme or otherwise.After reading the text of Clause 22 of Annex 2,Part 8 of the Treaty, he pointed out that in effect theReparation Commission would be acting in conjunction withthe Governments concerned.SIR JOHN BRADBURY pointed out that it would benecessary for the Allied Governments to amend Annex 2 be-fore the Reparation Commission could formulate proposalsnot at present covered by the Treaty.     For this purpose it would be necessary that the Serbian Government shouldbe represented at the Conference since that Government hada representative on the Reparation Commission.     Moreover,some little time must elapse before the necessaryformalities....
formalities, such as the execution of an amending protocol,could be carried out aHe agreed that the words of Article 233, relative to the commission 8 powers of prescribing the time and mannerfor securing and discharging the entire obligation within aperiod of 30 years from the 1st May, 1921 were very wide, andhe himself had held that any outstanding bonds unpaid on theexpiration of tha 30 year period would continue to run onthereafter.     His colleagues on the Commission, however, tookan opposite view and held that under the Treaty the entiredebt must be extinguished within the 30 year period.Some discussion followed as to the recent refusal ofthe Germans to appear before the Reparation Commission.Sir John Bradbury explained that the Germans had refused tocome and discuss the Coismisslon1 e original schedule until theresult of the Conference of London was known.THE PRIME MINISTER thought that such refuse! justifiedserious measures\ires, and he suggested that if the Germans declined to appear before the Reparation Commission before May 12tlu , theCommission might then proceed to treat Germany as in defaultsSIR JOHN BRADBURY remarked that he was doubtfulwhether he would be justified in taking up this attitude.     he agreed that apart from the question of the 30 year period, theother points were Annex 2 points.     He also .agreed with the PrimeMinister and Sir Robert Home that the &quot;Arrangement&quot; should goto Germany as a whole and. that no attempt       to split It up should be made.      In any case it would have to bo made perfectly clear that the question of guarantees was for the Governments.As regards communication to the Germans, he was strongly of opinion that thia should be done by the Conferenceand not by the Reparation Comoission.THE PRIME MINISTER
THE &quot;PRIMS-MUSISTERr pointed out that it was very nec-Qssary to try and help Prince in the matter.     M. Briand had stated that he had foregone substantial suns by agreeing to the&quot;Arrangement&quot;.     While this was not the case, French publicopinion could not be convinced and it was desirable to do every-thing to meet the French Government.SIR JORB BRADBURY thought that it might be possible forthe Reparation Commission to draw up a schedule of paymentsbasod on the figures specified in the &quot;Arrangement&quot;, and put Intothe 30 year period all amounts which under the &quot;Arrangement&quot;would fall outside the 30 year periodcSIR ROBERT HORHE thought that it would be better ifthe Reparation Commission could see its way to take the &quot;Arrange-ment&quot; as a whole *SIR JOHN BRADBURY said that he, personally, could riotbe a party to the adoption of the &quot;Arrangement&quot; by the ReparationCommission, and some of his colleagues held stronger views on thopoint than he did.     He would have no objection to submitting a schedule to the Germans, and at the same time informing them thattho Allied Governments had agreed the &quot;Arrangement&quot; which theReparation Commission would be prepared to endorse i :&apos; Germanyaccepted It.     Another possible alternative, though ens involvingsome delay, would be for the Reparation Commission to postponesending thoir schedule to the Germans-and to Invite the obewrv-ations of the lattor on the &quot;Arrangement&quot;, the Allies In themeantime sending Germany their ultimatun.The Meeting felt that this lattor altornative was impracticable.LORD D^BBRNON suggested that it might be desirableto have a document drawn up bringing the provisions of tho&quot;Arrangement&quot; within a 30 year period.SIR JOHN BRADBURY said, in reply to a question put by\\the Prime Minister who asked how it would be possible to prepare\a schedule of payments with the proposed index number, .th&amp;t\in
oo.his view the Reparation Commission schedule need not necessarilyprovide for payments on an arithmetical basis.     He &amp;&amp;de&amp; th&amp;tMo Duhois, the Chairman of the Commission, would voice theCommission^ views at the Meeting of the Inter-allied conference this afternoon.(The proceedings then terminated),Z, Whitehall Gardens, S*W*4th May, 1921.
