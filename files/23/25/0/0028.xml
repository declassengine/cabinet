(i) With reference to Cabinet 17  (21) , Conclusion 5, theI Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Secretary of State&apos; *or *Vars covering a Note by the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff with appreciations by the General Staff and by general sir 0,H. Harington in regard to the Military Situation in constantinople (Paper CP,-2931),  as well as a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State  for bar covering a No be by general harington in regard to the organisation of a furbish gendarre--eri^ for the Ismid Peninsula (Paper C,P. -2091)vGeneral Harineton made a statement in amplificationof his  two Memoranda.The general effect 0&quot;  the aoeve Memoranda and ofGeneral Karingten&apos;s statement was that the position of theGreek Army in Asia Minor had so far deteriorated, and that ofMust anna Kemal had so far improved.,  that there was everyprospect of the Greeks being driven back on Smyrna.    already the Greek Division now  on the Ismid Peninsula was about to be withdrawn.    If events teck this course the Allied position atConstantinople would become uncovered.., and;, in the absence of strong reinforcement s t  they would be liable to defeat byMustapha Kemalr    The military authorities were Linani;iemi thaton military grounds the retention of our small force withouth.ps of reinforcements was unsound and dangerous.General Earington further explained that the weakness of the situation was increased by  the refusal ,.f the allies to agree to a unified Command under the British GeneralOfficer 0ommanding-in-Chief in the Constantinople area, inspite cf the repeated efforts of the British Government.General Harington also explained the difficult positionhe was placed in by the refusal cf the French and italian governments to support their High Commissioners in their approval of the organisation of a Turkish gendarmerie underthe instruction of a few British officers in the Icraid Fonin-peninsula-.In reply to various questions-,  General Faring ton
expOAin^r &quot;the^jftl.-jLlid^a,..-lja&apos;^he- event of a withdrawal fror:Constantinople, of holding a position to cover the Dardanelles,^hiCh would nec^ssi-l-ate the occupation of both sides of theStraits and would require a considerable  force.    If such apolicy were, adopted the Allies could, in hi a opinion,   scarcelydo less than leave a nucleus of officers and ; or: to organisean effective Turkish gendarmerie in Constantinople,The Cabinet then considered *he bearing on the problemQ&apos; Constantinople of information of th-   concentration of turkish Divisions in the Diabekr region, to the north of M-: so-potamia (Paper CP.-2992).Having listened to a statement o* the dangers of theposition at Constantinople from a military point of view, theCabinet then heard from the Secretary of State for foreign-f^alrs the objections,  from a political point of &quot;lew,,  to apolicy 0&quot;^ withdrawal, which,  in his view, would be far-rea chingand calamitous . involving the sacrifice of oil the results ofthe Allied victory over Turkey.    whether I&amp;rtaoha Komai dealtfirst with Smyrna or Constantinople, he would before long bein control o* *-h** latter city if the Allies Withdrew.    Once hehad driven the Creeks out of Smyrna he would have Thrace at hismercy.    Thereafter would revive the old habit of massacre ofChristians and minorities throughout- Asia Minor.    Mustapha FernaLvictorious and bitterly hostile, would ha- - achieved a comtnarid-ing position from which he could not be ejected.    MeanYhiXy,tbe French were currying favour with the Turks by installingTurkish officials throughout  Syria, and after th&quot;&apos; occupationof Constantinople by Mustapha Ketral it was not unlikely thatthe French and the Italians would be found at his side.    Inaddition, there was increasing evidence of a connection betweenMustapha Kernel and the Bolsheviks.    These developments had very dancrerous potentialities for the British position in the
Bast.    Lord. Curaon-erwierVy- outlining a course of policy for meeting this situation.The Secretary of State for the Colonies pointed outthe dangerous reactions which a withdrawal from Constantinoplewould have on our position in Mesopotamia and Palestineunless it were carried out as part cf a general peace with turkey.The Secretary of State for India urged that,  assuringas had always teen the Allied intention,Constantinople was to he evacuated,/it was most desirable toattempt to reach a peaceful agreement by meons, not of a partial and niggling modification of the Treaty of Sevres, butby means of a substantial modification which would make itacceptable and really operative.After a further prolonged discussion, in the courseof which the Prime Minister reviewed the arguments which hadbeen advanced and the various proposals w^ich had been made,the Cabinet agreed ----(a) ^o request the Secretary of State forForeign A^^airs, ir. consultation withthe secretary to the Cabinet, to draft a summary of Conclusions for considera-tion at a further meeting of the Cabinet:(b) That the Staffs of the Admiralty, WarOffice and Air Ministry, in concert,should draw up a Report to the Cabineton the possibility of holding a posi-tion which would enable  the Allies tosecure the passage of the Dardanelles(thereby enabling them to exercise navalpressure at Constantinople),  and on theminimum forces with which such a position could be maintained against a Turkishattack.    The Cabinet particularly desireda Report ac to whether t&apos;e passage of theStraits by am on red ships could be saferguarded by holding a position on theEuropean side of the Straits only.
May 31,  1921.DWith reference to Cabinet 14 (31)-, Conclusion 5IS ^rim^l.-- ^-fhe^S^r^^^r^tato for the OoLorries asked, as astimates.     matter- *furgency, for th* direr-tirvn of the Cabinet in the present-pa-ation o^ the Estimates for the Middle East Department.Mr Churchill pointed out that before going to Cairo he had agreed with the then Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr Chambers-lain) on a sum of  30, CDC, COO for the Middle East fcr thecurrent year, but during his absence this sum had beanreduced by the Cabinet to  26 ,5C C,0, though it was subs3-guently raised by the War Office to  32,500,000.    He far-,!,therefore, on his return that the savings of  5,500,000which he had effected at Cairo had been discounted to theextent of  4,000,000, and this made it impossible for him tomake a financial statement rit which would be satisfactory to theHouse of Commons on Thursday next..    The  1.500,000 which hehad in hand had been further reduced to  1,164,000, everagainst which he had to meet certain extra charges, namely, 250,000 on Air Estimates,  500,000 for Native Levies, $10,CO&quot;) for refugees of all hinds,  200,000 for subsidies,and  150,300 for Trans-- Jordania,    As a result, it would benecessary for him, unless the Cabinet directed otherwise,  tomake a further demand in the Rouse for  1,003,000.    In hisopinion the War Office charges were capable of compression,and it should be possible to save the ertra charge when itwas remembered that prices were falling, that the rapes had fallen from Is.3d. to Is.3d,, and  that it was contemplatedafter the hot weather to make a further withdrawal of troops,Subject to these considerations and to there being no rebel1-ion in Mesopotamia, he thought it would be prudent to press the War Office to under-estimate their charges by  1,000,000in order to realise economies to that extent.The Cabinet agreed  T*a authorise the Secretary of State forthe Colonies to prepare and print hisEstimates on the assumption that therewould be a saving of  1,000,003 on theWar office charges.Whitehall Gardens , S.W. 1,-.
