&apos;^TTOW With reference to Cabinet 31 (-21), the Cabinet had beforethem a Draft Resolution prepared by the Belgian Represents i ^-e sCwith the approbation of M. Briand, for the consideration ofthe S-epre^e Council  (Appendix.. T) .The Prime Minister explained that, while r-cognising thatthis document constituted a great advance on the Franco-Belgian attitude of the previous day, he had criticised theform and had reserved his assent on the question of principle.In fact, he had made two observations:-(i)  &apos;1There must be no blank cheque to theFrench,    The terms to .be enforced on germany must be clearly laid down inadvance, and must be agreed among theAllies before any assent could begiven:(ii)  He must consult the Cabinet heroreexpressing any opinion.Misgivings were expressed both as to  the principle and theform of the- document.    On the principle it was pointed exit thatin return for a v:ry short delay of a week, this document,which Germany was not in the least likely to accept, would not.only involve our consent and authority for the French mobilise-tion but would commit us irrevocably to participation in theoperations against Germany, and might end in our beingen+ancled in most difficult and prolonged operations.    Itslegality was questioned, and the form was criticised in manydetails and was shown to require much alteration in detail inorder to bring it into conformity with the Treaty of VersaillesThe question was raised as to whether the proposal, ifapproved, should be forwarded to Germany through the Repara-tions Commission or through the United States of America.In favour of the latter course the Cabinet were reminded thatGermany had in effect agreed that she would acce;t anything which America approved.    The new proposals under considera-ticn by the Allied Expert Committee were technically slightlyat variance with the Treaty, and there was,  therefore, adpp??,!be  advantage in arranging for America to father thes cheme.It was eruggwrbed that the proper course would be to
-eotaonieate thP achea.e, as approved by the Allied Experts, tothe Reparation Commission.    After giving its approval, theReparation Commission, as provided by the terms of the Treatyo^ Versailles, weald then communicate its decision to Ger- anvThe Allied &apos;-o&quot;&quot;governments^nts *-euld also COB-Jturiicate their v.ltimatuEto Germany,  giving Germany an adequate interval to accent.It -was pointed out that it was rest unlikely that theGerman Government would ever sign except under duress.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To authorise lord Cursor, who was about to preside over a Drafting Summittee of theSuoreme Council,  to proceed on the lines agreed tc at the Cabinet held on the pre-vious evening.    This basis had been draftedas in Appendix II to these Conclusions.,though it was recognised that the draft resolution would have to be considerablyrecast in order to meet the views of theAllied Delegates.(b) To invite Lord Curzon&apos;s special attentionto the importance of not including anything-arhdch could be cited in support of the pro-pa eanda of the Communists to the effectV at f-e real reason for t1 e recent calling out of t: e Reserves and the creation of theDefence Force was that they might be sentto t? e Ruhr.(c) t; at the document as re-drafted by t&quot; eCommittee of Allied Representativespresided over by Lord Curzon, should be circulated to the Cabinet at V p same time as it was communicated to tie members ofthe Supreme Council, and that i !f any memberOf the&apos; Cabinet felt t&apos; at further discussion was required before the fritis&quot;   Governmentwas committed to  its acceptance, he should communicate ,- t once witr  the Pri - Minister.2, !*Mte\all Gardens, S.&quot;hl,May 1, 1921.
APPShDIX I TO CABINET 52 gH-The Supreme Council, taking note of the fact that, inspite of the successive concessions made by the Allies sincethe signature of the Treaty of Versailles, and in spite ofthe warnings and sanctions agreed upon at Spa and at Paris,as well as of the sanctions announced In London and sinceapplied,  the German Government is still in default in the fulfilment of the obligations incumbent upon it under the terras of the Treaty of Versailles both in regard to disarma-ner-t and the trial of the war criminals, and in regard tothe payment of the 12 milliards of gold marks which felldue on the 1st of hay, 1921, and which the Reparation Corn-mission had called upon It to pay at this date --DECIDES that there is ground for taking at once thefollowing measures:-(1)    The Allied Powers decide to proceed, to theoccupation of the Valley of the Ruhr, to take allother military and naval measures that may be useful, and for thin purpose to begin at once(from to-day) the calling up and concentration of the armed forces:(2)    Desirous at the same time not to depart from thescrupulous observance of the Treaty, the AlliedGovernments invite the Reparation Commission to fix., without delay, on the basis of Articlo 233of the Treaty, the methods of payment of Germany1sdebt, as well as the guarantees destined to ensurethis payment, and to announce them to the GernanGovernment on the 4th of May at latest.These measures will not be suspended unless the GermanGovernment shall, by the 8th of May, have given a pure and simple acceptance, without reserve or conditions, to the de-cesions thus taken by the Reparation Commission, as well asto the measures of disarmament decided upon by the Inter-Allied Military Council, and shall have furnished the guar-guarantees required by the Reparations. Commissions.
APPSNDUF TI to Cabinet. 32 (21) .DRAFT RESOLUTION.The AJJJjed&quot; Governments accept the prlijclpie that thecontinued Failure of the German Government to fulfil its obligations under the Treaty of Versailles can only be netby the enforcement of further sanctions, and that It willbe necessary to place these In operation if, after receiving the Report of the Reparation Commission fittingnot merely the total debt of Germany, but tho methods of payment and the^-rteoet*sej*yr-^ government within a period of .......... days of their receipt,declines to accept the decisions of the ReparationCommission,The Allied.&apos;Gcvernmente-will then proceed Inabsolute co-operation and with their full strength totake such steps for tha further occupation of german territory or otherwise as may be necessary to enforce the above decisions-.      Such-occupation shall continue until the remaining provisions of tho Treaty of Versaillesin rospect of disarmament,  the trial of war criminals, Stc.shall have been sufficiently-carried into- execution *The Allied,Governments, conscious of the special position&quot;of France and Belgium, and of the apprehensionsthat may be caused by the continued failure of theGerman^government to carry out the disarmament provisionsof the Treaty, express their approval of the proposedmobilisation of Frencfc and Belgian forces with a view to possible c*ntingences *ay 1921.
