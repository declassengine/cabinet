CABINET PRO- (1) The Lord Privy Seal explained that during the presentCEED^IGSDURING THE crisis, when the Prime Minister&apos;a tine was almost entirelyINDUSTRIAL *CRISIS. occupied with negotiations in regard to the industrial crisis,Mr Lloyd George had asked him to summon meetings of theCabinet and Conferences as required to meet the situation.THP INDUSTRIAL      (?,)  The Lord Privy Seal, who had seen the Prime Minister,CRISIS.  reported the facts of the present situation,    Mr Hodges, whoseThe PresentSituation.     attitude indicated extremist leanings, had made a lucid andskilful speech in which he had shown that his policy was to force to the front, as an immediate issue, the question of anational pool.    If this were refused, it was idle, in MrHodges&apos; view, to discuss sucfia matters as the 1? per cent, andother figures.    The Prime Minister had therefore discussed[ with Mr Chamberlain what line he should take.   A suggestion had been made to him from a Labour quarter that he should playfor time and try and prolong the negotiations beyond tonight.The Prime Minister, however,  thought that while the minerscould understand a direct refusal, they would vigorouslyresent any jockeying or finessing.    He had thought,  therefore,that it would be advisable to state clearly that a pool wasimpossible.    Mr Chamberlain had then made the suggestion that,while a national pool in the sense that all profits should go into a pool, with a uniform rate of wages for all districts,was clearly out o^ the question, it might be worth making itclear that we did not exclude the possibility of a nationalsettlement with wages varying in the different districts. Ananalogous system was already in operation in connection with various other Trade Unions;    for example, the Dockers, Agri-cultural Labourers, and School Teachers.    The Prime minister had asreed that  this proposal was worth considering, and a document had been prepared setting out that, in the view ofthe Government, a compulsoz-y pool was impossible, a pool on a voluntary basis would break down, and that in any case poolingmust result in inefficient and uneconomical working of theindustry;   but that national negotiations, combined with
varying district rat33 of wages, wag a practicable method*s of dealing with the difficulty.    The Prime Minister was disposed to put the positive suggestion of national negotiations-tions first, and the negative statements afterwards.    He had thought;, hov/ov^r., that the situation was of such a gravecharacter as to warrant a meeting of the Cabinet to review the arrangements made and to soe that everything was  inorder,  in the event of an extension of the dispute.Some misgivings were expressed as to the way in whichthe crisis had been brought about, and the very sudden and heavy fail in wages involved in the proposals of the coal-owners.    Tt was also pointed out that any arrangements which involved the closing of a number of uneconomic mines musthave serious consequences on the employees, and that every-thing should be done to mitigate the economic effects of suchclosure.    During the War the miners had shown that they wereintensely patriotic; and it would be a calamity if Labourgenerally obtained the impression that the Government wassiding in this matter with the employers..On the other hand it was pointed out that the C-ovem-men t had throughout been most anxious not to commit themselvesin any way as to the reasonableness of the offer of the owners.Reference was made to Mr Hodges&apos;  explicit statement that, there was not enough, money in the industry to pay themen&apos;s demands, and to the considered decision of the Govern-ment that unless the industry was de-controlled the negotia-tions between the owners and the men could make no progress.Situation in (3) The Cabinet were informed by the Minister of transport the Coalfields.that his latest information showed a general improvement inthe coalfields.    Pumping was being carried out generally,except in Fife, where the disturbances were dying down.The Secretary for Scotland agreed that the situation as regards law and order was better today, except in Fife,where complaints were being made of intimidation and inad -- -aviate protection.    He -*ead a telegram received from the solicitor-General for Scotland (gee Appendix.....T) . and also-2-
The &quot;daily herald&quot;.. f - a reply which he had eent that morning aftar consulting with  Sir Robert Home (SeeAppendlx IX),    He asked the Cabinet to approve the action taken.The Cabinet took note of and confined theaction taken by the Secretary for scotland in the matter,,Extremist Pre-      (A) The Cabinet were informed by the Home Secretary thatMirations.the Lord Mayor of Newcastle was recruiting Special Cons tables for the express purpose of dealing with the Sinn Fein diffi- 1culty in the neighbourhood of Newcastle..   He also referred tothe mischievous activities of the Independent Workers of the&apos;&apos;rorld and the Communists  at Bradford,(5) The Hor&apos;e Secretary informed the Cabinet that the&quot;Daily Herald&quot;, which had been sailing very close to the windfor some days,  contemplated issuing at midnight tonight special-editions in London and Manchester advocating revolution in very violent terms.    Sir Basil Thomson proposed to interceptthe conies and, after reading one with Sir Archibald Bodkin, ,to take steps with a vi-w to a prosecution if the contentswarranted such action.Doubts were expressed as to the desirability of thiscourse.    It was generally f---lt that the publication of onestatement of a revolutionary character would bring home to thenation the gravity of the crisis and might do more good thanharm, although action would have to be taken to prevent itsrepetition.The Cabinet agreed  That no action should be taken as regardsthis particular issue of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;.(6) The Cabinet were reminded that, in addition to theSuoply ard Transport Committee, a Committee o^ Ministers (withthe Lord Chancellor in the Chair) , known as ^he Internal protection-tion Arrangements Committee, was dealing with the industrialcrisis, and it was suggested that the whole of the ordinaryexecutive work should now be taken over by    the Supply andTransport Cotrritt.ee, the Lord Chancellor&apos;s Committee remaining in existence so as to deal -ith important matters speciallyreferred to it by the Cabinet or fhp Supply and transport committee. -3-EMERGENOYCI-MMITT^S.
The Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should interview the Lord Chan-cellor, explair, the position to him, and,i* he concurred in the above suggestion,should arrange to notify the Secretary tothe Cabinet to this effect.SUPPLY AND (?) The Minister of Transport informed the CabinetTRANSPORT-COivUv.ITTEE.      the arrangements of the Supply and Transport CommitteeFinal Arrange- up- to date, but that it was highly desirable that cerments.decisions should be taken by the Coir-s-.ittee in advance rthan after th- actual declaration of a Triple Allianceotherwise it would take 48 hours to bring certain schemsuch as the Milk Scheme, into force.The Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary to the Cabinet should keep in close touch with the Prime Ministerand should convey the Prir e Minister&apos;s in-sf rue Hons to th* Minister of Transport,the no-re Secr**t?ry and the Secretary forScotland as to the moment of taking finalSupply and transport action.ENCOURAGEMENT        (&amp;)  The Cabinet agreed  TO LOYALWORKERS. That, as soon as the Prise Minister&apos;instructions were received, a notice inthe following form, which differs slightly^ror that given in Paper C.P.-2822, shouldbe issued to the English Press by the Poire&quot;Office and to the Scottish Press by theScottish Office:--&quot;In the event of the threatened extensionof stoppage of work,  th::: fovernr- ent wishto make it clear that it will use thefullest porer of the State to protectworkers who rerain at work in any of theservices esser.tia 1 to the life of theCornunity.    In any settle-: ent which, maybe- core to,  the Government will give their support, in securing that the position ofsuch workers si-all not be preiudic-^d ascor;par^d with their position before the stoppage.&quot;POSTAL ARRANGE-    (9) The Cabinet agreed  MENTS.That a warning should b- sent to thePost Office to keep important telegraphoffices open tonight, for dealing with R.-o,,&apos;arrir&quot;&apos;si&quot;&apos;t bus 1 he ss.The Minister of Transport- undertook totake up this r:attej^
JSP SPECIAL (IS) The Cabinet were informed by the Secretary of Statefor War that the total enlistment a in the Defence. Force upto last night amounted to 6,600 in 175 units out of 460,making a probable total of about 15,000 recruits on Monday.The somewhat unsatisfactory response was rrainly attributable to the -^alse impression given by the Press that the crisishad passed.    To some extent it might b&apos;- due to the falserepresentations that the men were required for service inGermany.    There was reason to believe that large numbers ofloyal citizens would enrol in tb/   Force if the crisis becamemere acute,    Evidence was given of the good feeling existinghfltrflori the troot)s ond the miners in South Wales.The Cabinet took note of this communication.Birmingham and      (11)  The Lord Privy Seal informed the Cabinet that theNottingham,Lord Mayor of Birmingham, who was a Quaker, had declinedpersonally to take action in accordance with the request con-tain e&apos;d in the telegram sent on Saturday last by the PrimeMinister to Local Authorities.    As a result of special tele-grams sent by the Prime Minister,  arrangements had been madeunder which action in Birmingham would be undertaken by the deputy Lord Mayor.The Cabinet were informed that a similar situation had arisen in Nottingham,,PROPAGANDA * (12)  It was suggested that,  in view of the great import-ance of the public being correctly informed as to the situa-tion, steps should be taken to deal with the Government pro-paganda on a more elaborate scale than was at present in foreIt was agreed  (a) That the Minister of Transport should raise this question at the meeting of the Supplyand Transport Committee that afternoon:(b) That the Committee should be informed thatthe Cabinet were prepared to authorise anyproper expenditure on this service whichthe Supply and Transport committee mxvhtj think it necessary and desirable to incurc1 Whitehall Gardens, S.&apos;-/*. 1,April 12,  1921. ,   ,   .   ,
