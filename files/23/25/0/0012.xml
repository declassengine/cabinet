These telegrams explained that theGerman proposals had been, communicated informally,  that MrHughes, the American Secretary of State, would not communicate them formally unless convenient to the British Government,that the American Government were anxious to help the Alliesand had hinted that, if it were agreeable to the Allies, theUnited States of America right take part in an expert economic commission to determine what amounts Germany has paid andshould pay.After a short preliminary discussion,  in the courseof which ther--&apos; was general agreement in the desirability ofco-operation by the United States of America, the cabinet agreed(a^ &quot;&quot;hat the new German proposals should beconsidered, in the first instance, by aCabinet Committee composed as followst-Mr Montagu (in the Chair),Sir L.

With reference to the Conference of Ministers held on April 11th, 1921, Conclusion 1, the Lord Privy Sealramar?od that when the Conference hed agreed to the flights to the serodromes in Trans jordania, so that moral support might be afforded to Abdulla, he had not realised that any further steps for the development of the desort route to Mesopotamia were in progress: now that news had been received from Sir P. Cox that a flight was about to start Westwards from Hit to reconnoitre the Eastern end again of this route, he considered that the question should again reviewed. The original Cabinet decision had deprecated any action which might complicate matters in Transjordania and had aimed at securing peace in that district by the influence of air forces based in Palestine: the Conferenceon April 11th had acted within the limits of this Cabinet decision when sanctioning the flight between Ludd and Amnan:

The Secretary of State for the Colonies stated that he had not originally proposed to bring this matter before the Cabinet as he considered that it was really one which could have been sanctioned departmentaily. The Cape to Caire flight, the flight to India and Australia had not been brought before the Cabinet, while the use of aircraft in the Somali operation in 1919 had been settled by himself and Lord Milner.

Air Vice Marshal Salmond had first flown across the desert in the winter of 1918/1919 and it had been proposed to send all aircraft from Egypt to Mesopotamia and vice versa by this route: then owing to trouble between the Preach and the Arabs, the general feeling amongst the tribes deteriorated and all planes were sent round by sea, an expensive and lengthyprocess. It was hoped that a better


better fooling was now being engendered amongst the Arabs, and at the recent meeting in Cairo all the political, military and air exports recommended the opening of the desert route at once with a view to strengthening the friendly tribal fooling towards use it was proposed to develop the route gradually by pushing forward from each ond by stages of 50 mile a or so, and to form at those stages small stores of petrol, etc. until the whole gap across the desert had been bridged. These small stores would have no personnel but be simply places whore planes could come down and refill if necessary. The Arabs could look after these small depots and would get a certain amount of pay ? for such work and so come to look upon the air force as a valuable friend. Before a Commercial Air service to the East could be established it was essential that the desert route should be developed as a first step and then at a later date the Royal Air Force and the commercial planes would be of mutual assistance.

At present on the west and of the route no advance had been made beyond Amnan, but at the Eastern end about 3 stages had been prospected: there was also a railway survey party reconnoitring for a rail and pipeline route across the desert and it had been suggested find to them that they might the present chance a suitable opportunity for pushing on with their work.

The Secretery of State for foreign Affairs considered that the precedents quoted were hardly analogous as they were probably undertaken as war measures: the opening of the desert route now might raise ? political questions not only with the tribes but internationally since so much interest was now taken in mandated territories. The development of the route would undoubtedly be desirable when it was safe to do so: in 1919 railway reconnaissance


reoonnaissances from both and had to  return owing to hostility on the part of the tribes and it was very question able whether thair feelings had now changed so much as to welcome our presence on this route: he was also doubtful whether the Railway Survey could be satisfactorily combined with the development of the air route.

The lord Privy Seal agreed that the tribes might not yet be sufficiently friendly for the development of this route and considered we might become entangled in complications which, at the present time, we could not afford to risk.

A discussion then arose in which it was pointed out that if negotiations had to be opened with the local tribes to guard the dumps it would not only take a long time but also be difficult to keep the tribes to their bargains: it was, however, remarked that in some cases the dumps would be in absolute desert where there were no tribes and that they would always be very small and require no personnel to look after them.    No orders had been given to the Railway Survey to work in conjunction with the Air Forces but it had bean pointed out to them that the present might be a suitable opportunity for them to advance their reconnaissance.

(At this point in Marshal Tranchar and Major Young entered).

Air Marshal Trenchard stated that from the information given to him by political officers in Cairo, he was of opinion that there was no danger of the tribes molesting anyone,the only danger was from breakdown or planes getting lost and although the Air Ministry would take every precaution against this, it must be expected in pioneer work.

It was proposed to develop the route stop by step so that the tribes would get to know in advance of the coming of the aeroplanes: in the first instance long distance planes would be used, flying 300 miles, and it would not be necessary for them to land between Azrak and Ramadi except in the case of a technical defect: it was only in this case that dumps would be required, and the disabled plane by its


its wireless could summon assistance if the dump were not available. It was not proposed to use short distance planes until the long distance ones had thoroughly established the route.

Major Young poluted out that the Eastern portion of the route had no water at all and was quite uninhabited except for occasional moving bands: any trouble which might be expected from the tribes would be from the Palestine end.

The Secretary of State for India remarked that Abdulla was now in Trans-Jordania and would presumably be of help in smoothing the way with the tribs at the Western end: he was of opinion that the scheme should be preceeded with.

Some further discussion then took place in which it was pointed out that all the political officers concerned including the High Commissioners of Palestine and mesopotamia, recommended the inauguration of the scheme now and that they were of opinion that no danger was to be expected: it was also pointed out that whatever risk might be incurred, would be in the section West of A?rak, an area to which the extension of our air influence had already been sanctioned.

While the sense of the meeting was strongly in favour of not adopting any policy which might tend to increase British oommitments the conference agreed that:-

As all a part opinion considered that there was no risk, the development of the desert air route to Mesopotamia should be proceeded with on the lines proposed by the Secretary of State for the Colonies
