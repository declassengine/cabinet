other centres In the North and In South Wales, and thatIns true tiona had been issued three  ays ago requesting the0ommanding 01ficer3 to keep in the closest touch with theChief Constables of their districts.(1)  ^e Secretary of State for War undertook to draw the immediate attention of the commanding officers to the danger of wut-breaks in the mining areas, and to havetroops  available in case of requisitionby the Civil Authorities:(iS.)

jE^gNT^       (1) Arlfflnfr.tnit.of the Debates in J?parliament on theTHE uftAL &apos;^wlwd&amp;^ the-Ofmf^r^n^-dd^mssed the prospects ofsome means being found for a settlement.The Prime Minister described &amp; conversation whichhe and the Chancellor of the Exchequer had had with Mr HerbertSpith and Mr Hodges ao the result of the good offices of a third partyc    The Prime Minister had informed these miners&apos;leaders of the nature of the general statement he was about to make in the House of Cornmans % offering the Government&apos;sgood offices towards bringing the parties.together, on theunderstanding that there would be no Government subsidy andno control.   The miners&apos; leaders, if not acquiescing, did not suggest that this offer was without value,,Reference was made to various proposals made duringthe debates in Parliament, such as the possibility of anational settlement of district rates and measures to &amp;v*ertan abrupt and heavy fall of wages in particular districts,bu*&apos; ^or the moment discussion of these was considered to be premature.The Conference agreed --(a) That the Prime Minister, on behalf of theGoverni- snt, should immediately send ident-ical letters bo the Mining Association andto the Miners&apos;&apos;  Federation, calling attentionto his statement in the Hoace of Commons onthe previous evening, tendering the good offices of the &quot;Government in bringing together the two parties to the dispute,and indicating that the other party wasbeing notified:(b) That an unofficial communication should bemade to the Transport Workers, who weremeeting at the time, that these lettershad been sent.(The action specified in (a) and (b)above was taken during&apos; the meet in DME MINE- (S) Arising out of the previous discussion, the Confer-&amp;NERS&apos;SjFFER. ence agreed -To invite the Boar A of Traofe to circulate to the Cabinet a Memorandum setting out and explaining the true facts in regardto the mine-owners * offer that theirprofits from the coalmines should bolimited irt the first instance to i1&apos; per cent,of the miners&apos;  standard wages in 1914,.
and 20 per cent of the surplus profit.regarding which some anlmach; ersiche hadT been made in the debate in the House ofCommons atS3 0? (5)   With reference to Conclusion 5 of the Conference ofTERRITORIALFORCES.      Ministers held on April 5th, the Conference were Informedthat, as the result of a consultation with the GeneralOfficers Commanding the Territorial Divisions./ the ArmyCouncil were satisfied thai, while no legal and binding pledgehad been given, it had been practically  stated by thoseappealing for recruits that the Territorial Forces would notbe used for the maintenance cf intern? 1 crier.     Tills hadbeen reported to the Prime xtinicier, whc had referred thequestion to the Lord Chancellors Sub-committee ttee of the Supplyand Transport Committee,     In the circumstances, the latterSub-Corn&quot;Ittee had cone to the conclusion that it would be inadvisable to take any steps towards calling up the Territorial-Force, or to use that Force for the incorporation of volunteers.They had recommended the creation of a new Force, to be called&quot;The Defence Force&quot;, enlisted for 90 days, and subject to theArmy Act.     Sufficient forces could be raised within thenumbers provided by the Arm?/ Annual Act, 1920-21, up to April50th, but only a snail force of some 20,000 to 50,000 men could be maintained within the numbers provided by the newArmy Annual Bill.The Conference agreed -(a) To take note of, and approve In principle,the docision to create a new Force: arc! direct that all preparations should be made,(b) That, If possible, consideration in Committeeof the Army Annual 3111 should be postponed for a few days, in case it might be necessaryto introduce amendments increasing the strengthof the provision in the Bill:4c)   That the actual enlistment of the defence force should not be proceeded with, withoutCabinet sanction:(d)   That no publicity to this proposal should bemade In the meantime,THE FIFE-       (4) With reference to Conclusion 2 of the Conference ofSHIRS PITS.I Illnlsterc held on April 5th, the Conference were informed
that, according to the latest information, all the Fifeahirecoal pits were flooded and would probably require weeks forclearance.   The questions of pumping out these pits and pro-tectine the volunteers thus engaged would probably not ariseimmediately.Particulars were received during the meeting *fdisorders in the Fifeshire coal district, and the conference were informed that the Secretary for Scotland had given ordersfor the arrest of the ringleaders.    No information was beforethe Conference as te whether the Battalion referred to at theprevious meeting had arrived in the district, or whether,having regard to other demands on the available forces, theGeneral Officer Commanding had been able to send them to Fife-shire.The Conference agreed -That it was essential, in the interests p-fjmbllc order, that the ringleaders shouldbe arrtcsted and order restored in the Fife-shire district.FLOODING IN        (5) The information m yet before the Conference did notOTHER COAL-FIELDS,        confirm the allegations in the Press as to extensive andmenacing flooding of mines in the South Wales Coalfield.EMERGENCY (6) The Minister of Transport consulted the Conference asACTION.  to whether immediate action should be taken under the threeWarning toRoads Com- fallowing heads:-missioners.- (i) The issue of a preliminary warning to the closing of Rea^s Cormtsaioners, who required 48 hoursRegents Park. to set their organisation in motion:R.A.C. and sea.(ii)    The closing of Regents Park:Organisation.(iii) A request to the Royal Automobile Club andthe Automobile Association te set in opera-tion their organisation.       If action werenet taken in this matter at once, there wouldbe considerate delay in the provision of any local services to replace tramways, omnibuses,etc., as 36 hours was required to set theorganisation in motion.   Moreover, if railway traffic and pestal services were interrupted,the extent of the delay might be considerable.
Ip&quot; &quot; After so:.e discussion, the Conference agreed --That a precipitate tiecJLsion alight prejudice the RaiJLvraymen and Transport Workers, andthat a decision should be postponed untilthe sane afternoon, when it was hoped thatthe position would be clearer.ETOTECTTOH      (7) V/ith reference to War Cabinet 627, Conclusion 1, the.P LOYALAIL WAY       Conference., had before them a l?ote by the Minister of TransportKPLOYEESII THE        -covering a letter from tho Chairman of the Railway GeneraljfprT OF ,/WffiRXEET wa   -ilana^ers^-Oomrr^^ the Railway- tk3rapanJjas---to-prepare for issue to the men, as soon as a strike- wa^-d^clar^dj^^^ircTilaj?.-Ltrt-ter ..jrimi.1.aj:*--to-^tha-t sent -out- afterthe commencement of the Railway Strike in September,-1919.This circular contained a Government guarantee not only to afford protection to men who remained at work, but also tosafeguard their interests as railwaymen against any measuresor prejudice to which they might be exposed throughremaining at work (Paper C,P.-2796).While recognising that such a guarantee would be far more useful if issued before or simultaneously with the decisionto call the men out than after a strike had commenced, theConference entertained doubts as to whether the Governmentwould be in a position to fulfil their guarantee, any in anycase felt that it would be premature and provocative to take any action in regard to it in the present position.IPROPORTXOiiAL   (s)   The Conference were informed that a Private Member1sJRSPRESSI7TATI0E.Bill,, dealing with Proportional Representation, was duo for debate in the House of Commons on Friday next.Tho Conference agreed -That tho Home Secretary, on behalf of theGovernment, should state that ministers held divergent opinions on the subject,and that It was therefore proposed totake the Whips off,Mr. Shortt was to state at the same time that the Government could not allow a binding decision to be reached on a subjectof such far-reaching constitutionalimportance as the result of a private member&apos;s Bill Introduced on Friday afternoon.
^F^mow^T (9)   with reference to Cabinet 9  (20), Appendix  (1)    theOonf^rrenoe. had. under consideration the following documents relating to the question of home-grown wheat:-ofA Memorandum by the Farl/Crawford andBalcarres (Paper C.P.-2785),A Memorandum by the Minister of Agricul-ture and Fisheries (Paper C.P.-2784),A Memorandum by Mr Chamberlain (paper cp.-2768) .The-Corrf^Tf&amp;i^^w^^ifr^y?^^ jris^cnnms-ta-nces. in &quot;which., a, i*lftd.^e had boon Riven to the farmers&apos; under Trhich, thelatter were to receive 95/- a quarter for home-grown wheatof the 1920 crop.    It had, however, proved impossible to implement the pledge because the proposed machinery had broken down through the action of the merchants in repudiating theundertaking given by the President of their Association atthe Conference held on February 17th. last.    In the result,the financial benefits granted to the farmers by the arrange-ments approved by Cabinet 9 (21) were not, in fact, reaching the farmers.    Every possible means of inducing the merchantsto work the scheme had been tried without success.    The fact was that the merchants objected most strongly to any proposalswhich would involve disclosing their profits to the farmers.With regard to the question of cost, Lord Gx-awfordinformed the Conference that, so far as he was able to judge,the sche; e already approved by the Cabinet would involve an expenditure for the period November, 1920, to March, 1921, ofabout  700.000.    It was most difficult to estimate the addi-tional cost involved in the proposals contained in paragraph Sof his Memorandum (Paper CP.-2795), but he did not anticipate that this additional cost would exceed  100,000 in respect ofthe period in question.He was satisfied that the figures given on page 3 ofMr- Chamberlain&apos;o memorandum (Paper C,P.-2788) were based on some misapprehension.
The- Oorrf^rT^rno^r- were- &quot;reminded that it would he necessaryto bring this additional expenditure before the Mouse of-Commons, since it was not practicable to charge the moneyto the unspent balance of the Bread Subsidy Vote for 192*-2l.The proposals would certainly be severely criticised,  as it woube said that the Government were willing to subsidise the farmers Kit were refusing to subsidise other industries.On the other hand, it was pointed out that there had beena substantial profit made out of the Bread Subsidy operations,that it was most i-mpoxAant- tlratr-the Government should, not beo-porr-      .airy--charge o-f&quot;b-reach of faith with the farmers, andthat, the agreement, recently made .had..hroken ^downv-no^^irhrough-any fault of the farmers.The Conference agreed -(a) To approve the proposal contained in para-graph 3 of Paper CP.-2783, under whichmerchants&apos; certificates should be recognised for the purpose of the Home-grown ??heatScheme, precisely in the same way as millers&apos;certificates are recognised, on the under-standing that arrangements will be made tocertify&quot;the documents and safeguard theTreasury against fraudulent or improperclaims:and Lord Cra&apos;-dTord(b) That the Minister of Agriculture/should con-suit with the Financial Secretary to theTreasury, with a view to seeing whetherarrangements are possible by which financial provision for the Home-grown Wheat scheme could be made without recourse to a Supple-merit a ry Estimate.STATUS OF THF (10)  The Conference had before them a Memorandum (PaoerS^CRK&apos;&apos;&apos;ARV&quot; FORSCOTLAND.       CP.-2714) by the Lord Chancellor on the subject of theStatus of the Secretary for Scotland.The Conference were reminded of the pledges which hadbeen given from time to time to introduce legislation on thissubject, and also that Mr Chamberlain had recently circulatedto the Cabinet a Memorandum (Paper CP.-2789) covering theReport of the Select committee on the Remuneration ofMinisters.After some discussion, in which it-was pointed outthat it would be juost difficult to find time for the passage
of an opposed Bill during the present Session, the Conferagreed(a) That the Lord Chancellor should reply toLord Linlithg-w*s question in the Houseof Lords to  the effect that the Govern-ment had definitely decided to avoid, ifpossible,  an Autur-n Session, but that ifthe Bill altering the status of the Secre-ta-y for Scotland was unopposed the Gov-ernrrent would undertake to pass it into law.    If, however, the Bill was opposed    \from any quarter,&apos;the Government could       \not undertake to find time for the passage&apos;&apos;of the Bill! :   1(b) That negotiations with possible opponentsshould be entered into on the above basis,with a view to the Bill being treated asunopposed.RESTRICTION (11) With reference to Cabinet 1?

inter- alia, the resumption of pumping and other arrangementsimmediately essential to the safety of the mines.    The mine-owners had made it clear that they would not meet the Miners&apos;Federation so long as the latter were deliberately allowing the mines to be destroyed, and the Prime Minister had accord-ingly had communications with the Miners&apos;  Federation on thissubject.    It had then transpired that the Miners&apos; Federationhad not understood that measures to secure the safety of the mines were an essential condition of the resumption of dis-cussions with the owners.    Consequently, the meeting held that morning had been with the Executive of the Miners&apos;Federation only, and its object had been to clear up thi3rHE INDUSTRIAL      (1) Wiih xeferenoe-to-Ooncluaion 1 cS the Conference situation. &apos;- Ministers held on April 6th. the Prime-Minis ter notifiedEJtat e****nt ofche ,Po si t ioruthe jSonf erence of the results of a meeting which he    accom-panied by Mr Chamberlain, the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the. Minister of Laborer.      *the President of the Board of Tra-ie^ had held the same morning with the Executive of the Miners&apos; Federation, as theimmediate result of the invitation decided on at the Confer-ence of&quot; Ministers on the previous day.In order to explain the position which had beenreached,   the Prime Minister recalled that in the Debate inthe house of Comm..&apos; ns on April 5th. Mr Asquith had made his view perfectly clear,  that one or&apos; the essential conditionsof the resumption of negotiations, which he advocated, wasthat the miners should und-rtake to resume the services essential for the safety o&quot;* the mines.    In his own subsequentspeech the Prime Minister himself had made it no less clearthat this was an essential condition of the exercise of theGovernment&apos;s good offices to bring together the parties tothe dispute.    The invitation sent to the Mining association and the Miners&apos;  Federation in consequence of the decision ofthe Conference of Ministers on the previous day, had specificaly referred to the Prime Minister&apos;s statement in the House,so that there had appeared to be little room for doubt thatongUpt the essentials te the Governments mediation was,
specific point as a preliminarv&quot;&quot;^to-the- reopening -o-f -negoirVa--^..tions, -under the Governments auspices, between the Miners&apos;federation and the Mining Association.The Prime Minister had opened the meeting by readingextracts from his own and Mr Asquith&apos;s speeches, which,hehad explained, appeared to make clear his intention that the safety of the mines was one of the conditions;    but he had deliberately suggested that it was unnecessary to discuss thepast, and that the question should be considered on its meritsAt the outset the representatives of the miners hadrather taken the line that this was a condition which neverought to have been asked for:    but as the discussion continuedit became perfectly clear that this was not what was in their minds.    After Mr Graham had talked somewhat wildly and hadbeen snubbed by hi3 colleagues, Mr Tom xtichards, who is knownas a moderate man, had stated quite bluntly that the withdrawalof the safety men was a lever intended not only to force adecision in the miners&apos;  favour but a speedy decision, and thatthe Government were asking then  to hand over one of their principal weapons.    Mr Herbert Smith had then stated that unless the mine-owners would accept as a basis both thenational wage and the common pool,,  the safety men would notbe ordered back to the mines.    Cn the Prime Minister&apos;s remark-ing that this was a very serious decision, Mr Hodges had saidthat as a matter of fact it was a decision of the Miners&apos;Federation.This had made it perfectly clear, therefore,  that evenif the meeting between the Mining Association and the Miners&apos;Federation had taken plane, it must inevitably have broken downin consequence of this resolution by the miners not to order the safety men to return to the mines unless a surrender wasmade on the two most fundamental points at issue.    The PrimeMinister, after a short adjournment, had consequently made a considered statement in order to focus the issue on the point

Tothis the Miners&apos; Federation had vouchsafed no reply.The present situation, therefore^ was a very graveone, and the present Conference had been summoned to consider what fiirther precautionary measures should be take no(2) The Conference were informed that reports from many quarters indicated that the attitude of the railwaymen towardsthe miners was lukewarm.     The position taken by Mr. Bromley,the Secretary of the Locomotive Engineers&apos; and Firemen&apos;union, had exercised considerable influences(3) The Conference were informed that the storm-centres in Scotland were Fifeshire9 Lanark shire and Ayreshire.     the solicitor-General for Scotland had had a Conference with theGeneral Officer Commanding (General Davies) and Sir William Robertson, the Lord-Lieutenant of Fife, as a result of whichhe had telegraphed that they w ere all clear that the militaryshould not at present be employed for protection in Fifeshire*In this county the situation was reported to be somewhat betterIn Lanarkshire, the situation as regards public order had been somewhat bad, but reinforcements of police had beensent In and the position was restored^The slutation in Ayreshire was also unsatisfactory, but mr* James Brown, M.P., a Miners&apos; Agent, had gone there withthe intention not only of doing his utmost to restore orderbut also to secure, if possible, the resumption of pumpingin th^ mines *(4)   The Conference were informed that the reports fromWales were somewhat disquieting, and that unrest was increas-ing.     The Chief Constable of Glamorganshire hoped to obtain100 men from West Sussex.     The presence of troops, however,was considered desirables(5) The conference were informed that, apart from the disturbances in South Wales, there was no serious trouble inthe minefields south of the Tweed.

Wilson (Secretary)Lieut-Colonel Walker (Assistant Secretary),should be appointed to consider all protectionquestions arising out of the present situation,including the raising of special troops and the use oi the Forces of the Crown.     TheCommittee should have full Cabinet authorityto approve action being taken on all secondaryquestions, but should obtain the approval ofthe Cabinet to its recommendations on largequestions of policy, such as the enlistment of special Forces and the calling up of reserves.      It should work in the closest possible touch and co-ordination with theSupply and Transport Committee.(8) The Conference were informed that General lord cavan, the General Officer Commanding at Aldershot, was from today in charge of the London as well as of theAldershot areas, the two having been amalgamated for thepresent emergency.The Conference took neta of this arrangement with satisfaction.,, and the hope wa3 expressed that it would be impressed on General lord cavan that the Cabinet fully relied on his personal e xer-cj3e of ihj.3 au
&quot;&quot;that &quot;it was of greatm AND TRANS- importance that the facts of the present position should&apos;GRT WORKERS.be before the Executives of the Railwaymen&apos;s Uniafi and theTransport &quot;Workers1  Federation at the meetings which were bound to take place forthwith.The Minister of Labour undertook to concert arrangements for this purpose.(19) The Chancellor of the Exchequer undertook to draft a statement for the use of thePrime Minister and Lord Gurzon respective-ly in the House of Commons and House ofLords that afu^rnoon.ill S RE PRE S EN T A-     (11) Some discussion took place as to various misrepresented-llONS OF G-TV^N-ivrpTyT1? POLICY, sprstations o&quot;^ Government policy, which it was felt requiredearly refutation.    Among these were the following:-(i) A widely circulated statement to theeffect that tho Government were incollusion with Capital generally ina deliberate and concerted attemptto beat down wages:(ii) An allegation, made more than once inthe recent Debate in the House ofCommons, that whereas the reetingsbetween the representatives of &quot;theGovernment and the Miners&apos;  Federa-tion are public,  those with theMining Association are  secret.In this connection attention was called to a Memoran-dum circulated by Dr Addison, in which he pointed out that in very many districts the only newspapers on sale were copies0^ the &quot;^cnly Herald&quot;(Paper C.P.-S801).Various suggestions were made for overcoming this      *difficulty, including the distribution of leaflets,  even by post,  in areas where it was unsafe to distribute them byhand;    and the employment of Party electoral machinery forthis purpose.There was general agreement that it was very importanby some means or another to furnish material to persons of moderate leanings, who probably constituted the great masseven in the crining districts, in order that they couldcounter the arguments of the extremists;    and the general statement INPARLIAMENT.

TEE 0fAL (1)    With reference to Conclusion 1 of the Conference of1, Ministers held on April 7,  1921, the Prime Minister reported the latest developments of the Coal Dispute.    As a resultof the attitude of Labour Members in the Debate in the Hauseof Commons on the previous evening,  the Prime Minister,% &apos; after discussion with such of his colleagues as were avail-able at a late hour, had this morning written both to thei Mining Association and to  the Miners&apos;  Federation sendingthem a fresh invitation to attend a meeting at the Board ofTrade at Noon today, it being understood that the questiono^ t^e safety o^VthA pits should be disposed -Of before anyf other business was discussed.During the meeting of the Conference, an acceptancewas received from, the Mining Association, and this was fol-lowed later by a letter from the Miners&apos; Federation express-ing their willingness to attend a meeting without preliminaryconditions as to what was to be discussed, and stating that- -they were prepared to discuss every aspect of the situation with a view to arriving at a speedy and honourable settlement..(For the exact terms of the above corres-pondehce, which is of some importance,see Apperdix.)(0.P.-28^9.)After considerable discussion as to whether a Confer-wPp could usefully be held even without the preliminaryI-,.condition that the question of the,safety of the mines shouldbe discussed first, the Conference agreed  1That the Prime Minister should reply inthe terms of letter No.4 to be foundin the Append ix.(This letter was despatched towardsthe close of the Meeting.)nr^TTNAL (2) The Conference had before them, a recommendation fromPRt-r^^TON.&amp;RHANCtT&apos;- -the Committee on Internal Protection Arrangements,  in favour of-r-NTS.(a).Calling cut the Reserves:(b) liaising the proposed Defence Force:(c) A. confidential warning to General&quot;ftffic^rs Commandingthat the Territorial  Force would
not be called out, but that it was in-&apos;tended to raise a special Defence Force,The Conference were informed that the Scottish mine-owners had appealed for support,, but that the Welsh mine-owners were inclined to deprecate the use of military force,or even extensive use of volunteers for pumping, as- calculated to stimulate hostility.The view- was advanced, and met with considerable sup-port,, that if force were Employed&apos; at all in the mines- it mustbe adequate,, and it was pointed out that,, owing to the small numbers of the regular forces available, this at, once raised the question of the provision of increased, forces,,A new factor bearing on the decision to be taken,which was introduced during the meeting,, was the receipt&apos; ofan announcement by Mr J,.H. Thomas&apos; that the Railwayman andTransport Workers,  at a joint meeting, had decided to strike,subject to confirmation at a meeting of the Triple Alliance tobe held the same afternoon.It Was pointed out that the creation of the now forces would not contribute towards the immediate saving of the minesexcept insofar as the existence of growing reserve forces wouldenable the troops now available- -to be utilised more froely.Apart from the withdrawal of troops from Ireland,which was not deemed &quot;advisable beyond the three Bat Gallonsalready brought in, it was recognised that the- raising ofadditional troops was the only method by which a materialincrease in the forces available could be effected,.It was further pointed out that a favourable response to an appeal would provide a great moral demonstration as tothe sentiments of the nation.,,The Conference agreed  &apos;(a)  That if the Miners&apos; Federation&apos;&apos;should refuse the invitation to a further meeting:, thefollowing&apos;recommendations of the CabinetCommittee on Internal Protection.Arrange-ments should- be adopted:-
(i) &quot;The immediate issue of the Proclamationscalling out the Navy, Army and Air ForceReserves:(ii) That the Secretary Of State for should at the same time be authorised to proceedwith the raising of the proposed defence force,and took note that the Secretary of State for War had warned, in the strictest confidence, theGeneral Officers commanding-in-Chief thatit was not the intention of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to embody the Territorial Forces,but that should the necessity arise it was intended to raise a special Defence Force,for which authority would be sent by tele-grams(b) That the following Cabinet Drafting Committee should meet at 2-30 p.m. to consider the statements to bemade in Parliament on this subject the Prime Minister,Lord Ourzon,Mr Chamberlain,Sir Robert Home,Sir Laming Worthington Evans,Dr. Macnamara,Mr. McCurdy,(c) That the Home Secretary should be authorised toissue an appeal for Special Constables, which itwas thought would not adversely affect the re-cruiting of the new special Defence Force.(d) That Mr H.A.L.  Fisher and Sir Philip Lloyd-Greameshould draft a statement making a special appealto every miner,  for consideration by the drafting committee.(e) That the Secretary of State for War should prepare for the Drafting Committee the statement to be madein Parliament dealing with the Reserves and defence force.(f)That care should be taken by the Civil commissioners to prevent confusion in the enrolment of special constables and Volunteers,  and that the clearestpossible instructions should be issued as to the places where Reservists and recruits for the defence force should report themselves.DATE OFAPPEAL TOLCCAL AU-THORITIES.(3) The Conference took note that the Prime Minister&apos;s appeal to the Local Authorities, which had been forwarded to the various districts for publication in the event of thei
present--emergency--arising^--was dated April Cth.    It was felt,however, that this would not he very material, as &quot;hy April6th. the position was sufficiently Eerieus to necessitate the Government taking precautionary measures.2, Whitehall Gardens, S,W.1,April 8, 1921.

This is alsothe wish of the Government.     r,&apos;o have never suggested that any limitation should be imposed upon discussion, but as regardsthe order In which matters are to be discussed the national interest in the preservation of the mines Is paramount and Itmust take first placo.

The character of thenextminers&apos;  demands should/        be explained.    The duty of theGovernment should then \,q abated, namely, to protect property;to preserve order:    and to maintain the food supply and essential services of the country.    The action of the miners in assembling in great crowds in order to intimidate the men engaged in pumping and to prevent the- saving of the mines3hould be set forth.    The measures to be adopted should then be stated in such order as to emphasize the civilianmeasures and to put the military steps in the background;that is to say, they should be set forth in the following orde:

CHE MINERS&apos;&apos; FEDERATION.Refusal ofPropoeei3onferenoe.(1) The Conference took note of the following reply bythe Miners&apos; Federation to the Prirae Minister&apos;s letter sentduring the Conference of Ministers the same morning:-&quot;THE MINERS&apos;  FEDERATION,April nth, 1921.Dear Prime minister have to inform you that your furtherletter has been considered bv my Committee.We note your clearly stated condition thatthe question of the &apos;safety of the minesmust first be discussed and disposed ofbefore other matters are taken up&apos;.    Wethink the condition stands in the way ofa resumption of negotiations.As previously stated, we are willing tomeet the owners and the Government in con-ference at once if we are allowed to meetunconditionally.   We trust that the Govern-ment will raise no obstacle to ensure thisend.Yours truly,(Sd.)  FRANK HODGES&quot;.A short discussion followed as to the desirability,even at this late hour, of trying to arrange a further andnominally unconditional meeting between the two parties,but, on a full review of the circumstances, it was agreedthat no useful purpose would be served by such further attempt.It was agreed  That the Prime Minister should send thefollowing reply to the Miners1 Federation:-&quot;10, Downing Street, S.W.1,April 8th, 1921.Dear Mr Hodges,I have received your letter, and I notewith the greatest regret the decision atwhich your Committee has arrived.In view of the grave consequences involvedit is difficult to understand how any discus-sion designed to promote a settlement could usefully proceed unless we were all agreedthat the first task should be to senure thepreservation and safety of the mines without which there must be widespread and continuedunemployment and distress, not only for those whose occupation is in the mines, but for thewhole industrial population.
So far from placing any obstacle whateverin the way of negotiation, the action of thet- Government has been dictated solely by a desireto remove the main obstacle that stood in theway of fruitful negotiation.    The mines arevital to the life of the community,    theirdestruction is as fatal to the nation as would have been defeat in war, and to secure their preservation must be the paramountduty of Government.Yours faithfully,(Sd.) D. LLOYD GEORGE.&quot;3ALLING CUT (2) The Conference were informed that under the reserve of RESERVES.- Forces Act, 1882, Article 12  (1), as an essential preliminaryParliamentaryProcedure.     to the issue of the Proclamation calling up the Army Reserveit was necessary for the occasion to be communicated toParliament under Sign Manual from the King.At the present moment (4 p.m.) His Majesty was atWindsor Castle.    Under the Standing Orders the House ofCommons must, on a Friday, rise by 5-30 p.me    In view of theimmediate and urgent need to issue the Proclamation, theproblem facing the Conference was how to overcome the physical difficulties of procuring the message with theKing&apos;s signature attached before the House rcse.The expedient of asking the House to meet on Saturdaywas deemed inadvisable, if it could be avoided, as it wouldinvolve a debate, which, in the present obscure position,could not help the situation, and had better be postponed until Monday.After telephonic communication with Lord Stamfordham,a-t Windsor Castle, and communication by the Leader of theRouse of Commons  (Mr Chamberlain) with the Speaker, thefollowing procedure was concerted:-(a) His Majesty the King graciously consented to proceed immediately to Buckingham Palace:(b) The Secretary of State for War undertook tohave the message ready and to make all ar-rangements for its signature on the King73arrival at Buckingham Palace, and for for-warding it to the House of Commons:(c) ^e Speaker agreed, if there was not timeleft -for the Prime Minister to make- his statement and for the House to hear theKing&apos;s message, to &quot;express the view that
he presumed the House would permit aslight extension of time before ad-jeurning:In the last resort, if there was no hopeof the message being received in time, tomove that the House 3hould meet on thefollowing day,THE STATEMENT (S.) The Conference discussed at some length the drafts,XN PARLIAMENT,prepared by Sir Robert Home and Mr Amery, as the result ofthe Drafting Committee&apos;s meeting earlier in the afternoon,for the statements to be made In Parliament the same after-noon,(The text of the statement as approved isattached in the Appendix (00Pg-S812).)preparation for FIRLICA-TION OP A&quot;ULL STATE-MF.NT OF THEGOVERNMENT&apos;policy,(4) The Conference agreed -(a) That a full statement of the Governmentesposition and policy in the present dispute should be published in the newspapers ofSuralay, April lith!(b) That the preparation of a draft for eon-sideration at the Conference on the follow-Inp morning should be entrusted to -The Minister of Labour,Sir Philip Lloyd Greame,Mr Amery*Mr McOurdy,who should meet in Mr McCurdy&apos;3 room atthe House of Commons after the adjoum-ment that day.FUTUREBUSINESS,(5) The Conference agreed --To meet on the following morning,Saturday, April 9th, at 10 a.m.2. &apos;VIII. t ftha 11 Gardens, S.W, 1,April 6, 1921,
* ft t* iCONFIDENT IAh.C. P. 2S12IHDXJ8TRIAL SITUATION.Statement made by the Prime Minister in Parliament onFriday, April 8th, 1921.Before the House rose last night I intimated that I proposed to ask the Coal-owners and the miners Federation toa joint conference at which the first subject for discussion should be the pumping and preservation of the mines, it being understood that, until that question was disposed of, noother matter should be taken up.      This morning I acted inaccordance with that intention,  and addressed to the&apos;Miners&apos;Federation the following letter:-&apos;&apos;-      I&apos;10 Downing Street,&quot;Willt ehal 1, S,W. 1.8th April, 1921.Dear Mr. Williams,In the course of the Discussion in the House ofCommons last night certain suggestions were made byLeaders of the Labour Party which have led me to make toyou a further proposal for a meeting with the Miners&apos;1&apos;Federation&apos;in order to make a start towards a solution ofthe present dispute.A suggestion was made to the effect that aConference might be summoned by the Government which shouldeal in the first instance with the question of the pumpinand preservation of the mines and that that matter shouldbe disposed of before any other question was entered upon.The Government has considered this suggestion and 1 havenow to invite your Association to send representatives at12 c! clock noc-n today to a conference to be held at theBoard of Trade upon these terms.Yours faithfully,(Signed) D.

The answer of the Miners&apos; Federation obvio\xsly did not meet the point which i had put, viz., that the questionof freeing the mines from water should first be discussed and dlsnosed of, and I accordingly addressed to Mr. Hodgesthe following letter10,-Downing StreetS * ^ &apos; 9 1 6April 8th $1921*&apos;Dear Mr. Hodges,I have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of thismorning.

Pro&apos;1 those oOittiuhioat lbhs and from the statementsdeliberately made at the meeting with mo yesterday it isplain that the Executive Committee of the &quot;liners5Federation are resolved to let the mines go to destruo-tion in the belief that they will th. :s intimidate theGovernment into a surrender to theirThe desperate character ef this policy is visible inthe disastrous effects which it will have on the livelihood-hood of the miners themselves.      hole villages whichderive their entire support from the mining industry will become derelict,  and thousands of families will hedeprived of the means of existence0    And from the pointof view of the nation as a whole the results are not lesscalamitous.    Goal is the foundation ef Industry&quot;,, and towreck coal-mines or allow them to he ruined by floodingis to strike at the life ef the whole body of oitlsenSoIt is accordingly the duty of the Government, as the trustee ef the nation, to prevent this catastrophe, noreespecially as it is becoming increasingly clear that Insome places at any rate largo organised bodies of minersare, by threats of violence, preventing this necessarywork being done by the mine officials and others willingto help 6Protection and ade uato protection mast be given tothose who are engaged In preserving those vital assets of the community *    ho other course is open to us.    Thenation Is, for the first time in its history,  confrontedby en attempt to coerce it into capitulation by the dos-truetion of its resources, and this menace is apparentlynow to he supplemented by a, concerted plan to suspend the transp rt services which  are essential to the life ofthe country
If the threatened railway and transport  workers strike take aplacs the supply of food and of other immediate necessaries of life will hi   denied to all classes of the population unless vol-unteers come forward to carry cp  the minimum of transport work required to maintain the most essential national  end municipalservices.      The  government  proposes to call for volunteers tohelp carry on these services,  and announcements will he madetelling volunteers at what centres they should  apply to he regie-tered aid instructed as to the help which they can test afford.Thebe toe will need adequate    protection in the discharge their patriotic duties while it io no lees essential that, in the face of such u. Widespread disturbance of the ordinary machineryof the life of the community, lav/ and: order should he effectivelymai iained.      The police- force, even when strengthened by the enrol-nent of special constables,  for which an appeal will be issued,will obviously be insufficient for this task in view of the verylarge number of points that require protection and of the organ-ised character of the interference with the vo luntary workers.They are entitled Id   look to the Goverirs nt for protection and help from the ar:ce d forces of the Grown in their difficult task.This protection the government has ued dec to  af f ord them in what-ever measure may he necssssry,   and therefore ore proposes to make aspecial appeal to patriotic citizeas to enlist.in an emergencyforce,  recruited not for the purpose of int erfering in any wagedispute, but solely to support tic   Felice in the- fulfilment oftheir duties to the -community.Enlistment for this force,  which we propose to call the&quot;Defence   Force, will be for 90 days  at the ordinary rates of i ay and allowances.    The Territorial Force&apos; will not he embodied of asked %serve, hut members of the Territorial Force and ex-Service mengenerally wixi he specially invited to enlist.    Enlistment willcoi.-m:slice tomorrow  at&apos;the Territorial Drill Halls and Headquarters,The Government have also cone to the conclusion that it is-
necessary, with the same objects in view, to strengthen the armed forces of the Grown now serving, and a have thereforeadvised the King that a situation hap arisen in which ho iajustified in s.auctioning the issue of a Proclamation calling up the Reserves of the Army, Kavy and Air Force.The cause of the present dispute is being represented in some quarters as a deliberate  attack upon the wages ofthe worker.      There Is no justification of a.y kind for thissuggestion.     The Government have never pronounced any opinion, nor have we formed any, upon i&amp;bs rates of wageswhich have been offered to tie miners by the ooal-owners:they have not even &quot;been discussed between the p parties.     when our service^ were offered in attempting to bring the parties together upon that matter the reply of the miners way thatit was of no use unless the Government wore prepared to subsidise the coal industry.     It was clearly acknowledgedby the miners that at the present tins   the proceeds of thecoal industry are not sufficient to yield the wages which theminers demand, and the only cois presented to the government by the miners is one for an Immediate suboidy from  the exchequer.      To this propoeitl on the Government have been unable to agree, for reasons which have already boon fullydtated and are easily understood.2 Whitehall %,gardens, S.W.1.8th April, 1921.

(l)  The Conference were irrfurmed by -the---Secretary totb&quot; Post O^ice that the post and telegraph employes had.asked to see him in order to express their determination notto carry out &quot;blackleg&quot; duties in oonn-cticn with the impend-Ing strike of the Railwayman and Transport Workers.    fie had informed them that they would be expected to carry on theordinary psstal and telegraph cervices of the country.The ease which raised the most acute difficulty, SirEvelyn Murray reported, was that of a guard in uniform accom-accompanying  the mail in a van, or perhaps a lorry, which wouldhave to be driven by voluntary labour.    In disturbed districtssueh^pcxaona would be. liable-to assault, &apos;-.The general view was that the post and telegraphofficials must carry on their ordinary duties, but shouldnot be asked to handle extra-ordinary traffic in connectionwith the Strike, and that the Post Office should issue in-structians to the    effect that the local Postmasters, must use their discretion,in cases tf real danger, to allow postal vansdriven by volunteer lab cur to proceed without a postman guard.In    thie connection the Conference were reminded of the precedent of certain, railway stati urn-casters who had refusedduring the Railway Strike tn carry -out their ordinary duties in the case of-trains driven by volunteer labour, and had beendismissed.The Conference agreed  That the Secretary to the Post office should draft instructions to Postmastersin the above sense, and that,  in theabsence of the Postmaster-General, heshould, before issue, submit the draft frr the approval of the Chairman of theSupply and Transport Committee (TheMinister of Transport).
(2)       The Prime Minister gave the Conference an account of the present position, which is summarisedbo low.On the previous evening at about 8 p.m. thePrime Minister had received a message from Mr.Thomasasking him to receive a deputation from the Kailwsymenand Transport Workers who wished to announce their intention to commence a sympathetic strike in favourof the miners.The Prime Minister had received them at 10 a.m.when they had announced their intention to strike on tuesday, unless in the interval negotiations were resumed between the miners end mine-owners or government.The discussion had concentrated at once on thedifficulty of re-opening negotiations while no arrange-ments wore being made to prevent the destruction of the mines, and the Prime iiinistar had emphasised thet theposition of the Government had been they could not undertake what must be a prolonged discussion on thedetails of wages while the mines were rapidly teingleft to destruction.   - He had told the miners that onthis very morning he had summoned a meeting to considerthe measures to be taken for the protection of the mines.Eow, he hf&apos;d asked, was it possible for the Governmentto negotiate at length with the miners while they werepre-occupied with so grave a consideration?       The Govern-Bient were not concerned either with the interests of theminers or of the mine-owners, but those oi the nation awhich imperatively demanded the safety of the mines.He hed made it clear, howevur, that once the safety ofthe mines we a aejurad the Government were prepared to
take the&quot; ixiltlai^rve--l^Jre--^^?enj .ng riegotiairiona *     Solong, however, rs the miners were moleating..j)ajr8-onsemployed &quot;by the Government in the protection of -tb^Tuin&amp;a,whether volunteers or the staff of the mines, which waaone of the reasons for creating the new special defence force, the govern-ent could not take this action.Mr.Thomaa and Mr.Bevan had pricked up their earsat thia and Mr.Thomas had asked definitely whether, inthe event of the Miners&apos; Federation being willing toarrange for the preservation of the minea, whether byordering the pump men back or in the alternative by undertaking to ceaae molestation of those engaged in the mines, the Government would initiate a resumption of negotiations.     Co thia the Prime Minister had replied   \in the affirmative.After an adjournment the Deputation had informed the Prime Minister that on the understanding that theycould come back more than once if neceasary to 10, downing street they would like to adjourn to put thia propositionto the miners.     The Prime Minister had, of course,consented to this and had then pointed out that so longas the Railwayman and Transport Workers remained as itwere neutral they were in a very good position for acting as intermediaries, but that the moment they went on strike they became, as it were, parties to the dispute.Mr.Thomas had then emphasised that, at any rate, untilTuesday they were in a position to act as intermediaries.It had bsen agreed that there should be nocommunication to the Press until after the return of theDeputation to 10, Downing Street.
y^ic-rio;:.(9) report&apos;j Committeeon InternalProtectionArrangements(b)SituationIn Scotland.(?)    The Conference were informed that the CabinetCommittee on Internal Protection Arrangemnts were of opinion&apos;that the number of troops available was entirely inadequate to meet the situation in Scotland., where there were only three weak Battalions.     The Admiralty had been able to placesome 400 to 500 Marines at the disposal of the Committee, andthese were now on their way to Scotland.     The Committeewere of opinion that, apart from the calling up of the reserves, which would double the existing Battalions, itwas essential to have additional Forces available, andthey had therefore sanctioned the movement of 4 battalions of troops In all from Ireland.The Conference heard a general statement by the solicitor-General for Scotland regarding the situationIn that country, which was to the following effect;- onWednesday, April 6th, enquiries showed that in the whole ofFife pumping had been closed down.     In Midlothian there hadbeen progressive stoppage of pumping activities, and pumpingwas ceasing at the rate of two or three mines a day.     Thesame was true of Ayreshire.     Lanarkshire had shown the bestresistance, but pumping was also closing down there.     the disturbances had been caused largely by a peripatetic bodyof extremists, including Bolsheviks and Sinn feiners.     Thedanger fss that this body might move Its activities into other districts which were not affected at the moment.In consequence of the telegram from the PrimeMinister, which had been despatched on Wednesday, the solicitor-General for Scotland had conferred with AdmiralHeath, at Rosyth^ and the General Officer Commanding,Edinburgh, regarding troops and naval ratings availablefor protection.      The situation disclosed was a s follows:-(i) A Battalion of Gordons to protect Glasgow:(ii) A Battalion of Highland Light Infantry, atEdinburgh, which possessed a jy&amp;riking&quot;-forceof 100 men, who could be detached for service elsewhere:
(iiil. A-BaiiaOiJihxnorf^This Tjattalicn formeds  in fact,  the onlyreserve for the whole&apos;of Scotland,  since----^   the other Battalions were allocated to Glasgow and Edinburgh,The General Officer Commanding was of opinion that it -wouldhe very dangerous to draw on the Battalion of Seaforths, andthe conclusion had been reached that it was impossible tocomply with requests for the protection of pits on WednesdayApril cth.    On Thursday, April vth,  the Solicitor-General*     r.  i-,    , ,   , separatelyfor o*.*tland had conferred,/ with the General Officer--&apos;,        , -   and Admiral Heath.Commanding, Edrmburgh^and had made -the following arrangements.Irrespective *f the adequacy of the force available, theMilitary and Naval Authorities must respond to any appeal ofthe Civil Authorities  (a) For assistance in effecting arrests and thereby keeping the ordinary criminal procedure in operat i.      .(b) For assistance to Sheriffs% with a viewto maintaining order and protecting pro-perty.Admiral Heath would have at his disposal a body c? 150Marines who were already at Rosyth, and a further 400 t-c 500Marines who were on their way.    In addition, there was athough not trained for land work,certain number cf Naval ratings who/ could be used for pro-in the last resort.tection, purpose es/    Arrangements had been made5 i&quot; necessary,fc-r a sloop to anchor in Pethil Harbour,  and it was thoughtthat the moral effect of this would be good.    As regardsCowdenb^ath the situation was very difficult;    the youngerelement there &apos;&quot;as v^ry extreme.,  and bo*h Admiral Heath andthe General Officer Come-and&quot;- ng.   Edinburgh, had stated their inability to afford continuous protection to the mines.but had undertaken temporary protection.On Friday, April 8th,  the Solicitor-General forScotland had consulted again with Admiral Heath and theGeneral Officer Commanding,  Riinburgh,    At this conference it appeared that the Sheriffs in Lanarkshire and the chief constables were averse from the introduction cf troops, since
a disturbance,they feared Arrests were being made with fairsuccess.    The situation was different in Fife, and he had given instructions that the Police must abandon theirpossibly too friendly attitude towards th&quot;&apos; strikers andmust immediately effect arrests.    These instructions hadbeen given yesterday, and he hoped to hear today of arrest3having been made.   Arrangements had also been made in theIiOthians for certain suspected persons to be arrested.The mine-owners had been interviewed in regard tothe elaboration of a scheme of protectionThey had put forward a scheme and had unanimously selectedCowdenbeath as the danger point which required protection.When offered the alternative, they said that they wouldpr^f^r that thc Military Authorities should support theCivil Authorities in making arrests, than that a military force should be detailed to protect certain pits while otherpits w^re left unprotected.As regards transport, certain difficulties had arisen in providing transport at Retford, Rosyth and other places,but he had arranged that the necessary material should beobtained,    ^he difficulty was the lack of drivers, and itwould be necessary for authority t-* be given to him to recruit motor transport drivers voluntarily.S*me discussion ensued as ti the danger arising fromthe activities of the peripatetic body mi extremists, and itwas unanimously agreed that this body could not be allowed todefy the Civil Authorities, and that protection in the worstareas should be immediately, afforded,,As regards Edinburgh and Glasgow., the opinion was expressed that those Cities should bo able to from&apos;.ot them-selves, and so free the troops at present stationed there-for operations in the disturbed districts.    Tim danger wasthat i-f disabled^^ect-d elements in Lanarkshire saw that thePifeshire riots were not suppressed,  they would follow suitand th   trouble would spread.    Attention was, however, drawn. -6-
* to the fact that as regards Glasgow a well-organised and armed body of Sinn-Feiners existed there, and it was suggestedthat the Lord Orovost should be given discretion as to whethertroops should be moved away from Glasgow*After considerable dhscussicn, the conference agreed as follows(a) That every effort should be made to breakup the organised gang of rioters in Fifeshireand to arrest the ringleaders:(b) That the General Officer Commanding, Edinburgh,should be Instructed to release the maximum number of men possible from Glasgow, for useIn the disturbed areas :(c) That the 4th Worcestershire-Battalion, which &apos;was arriving that day f rom.

(o) si^mtlon The Conference were Informed that the situationin Walesain South Wales was dangerous and the population ofTonypandy was restive.     The pumps at Mid Rhondda had ceased at 6 p.m. the previous night and this would involvethe flooding of many pits.     The G.O.C, Western command had despatched 3 Companies of the Yorkshire &amp; LancashireRegiment to Cardiff.     These troops were not sufficientto enable guards to be placed at the pit heads, but theywould be retained in Cardiff and would stand by t here.The opinion was expressed that unless the disturbed areasIn South Wales were taken in hand, serious trouble would arise and that action should be taken immediately.    Witha view to dealing with the situation the conference agreed as follows(1)    That the Admiralty should immediatelyform a battalion for service on land from such naval ratings as wereavailable, this battalion to be underthe Army Command in Wales; and theWar Office to notify the Admiraltyof the particular points at whichit should be landed.(2)    That in view of the expected arrival of troops from Silesia one battalionshould be moved immediately by railway from London to Wales for the purposeof freeing the 3 companies at Cardifffor use In the disturbed areas.

(1) With^ :refBrerKve -to -Cab ire t -14 (21), Conclusion 5 (b),tho- Secretary of State for the Colonies reminded the Confer-ence that the policy regarding Trans-Jordania previously con-templated had comprised a military garrison at Amman of one battalion, two Squadrons,, and two guns.    The Cabinet had,however, misgivings as to these proposals, and he had praoeed-ed to negotiate with Abdullah on the basis of avoiding thenecessity for a garrison in Trans-Jordania.    The proposals were summarised in a Memorandum (Paper 0.P.-2815) circulatedto the? Cabinet, and under them-Abdullah *ras to have the as sis t-ance of Political Officers., his Native Levies were to be givenBritish Officers, and cash was to be advanced to enable him topay the levies.    Three aerodromes were to be established inTrans-Jordania for use by the Air Force, and Abdullah and thelocal levies would be visited and supported by the Air Squadronfrom Ludd.    These proposals haA the full assent of the Chiefof the Air Staff and the local Political and Military Authori-ties, and Abdullah had returned to Amman on the understandingthat they would be adopted.    If he failed to get support he might fall at any time, in which case Trans-Jordan!a would bethe scene of anarchy and a military occupation might be neces-sary,    The arrangements had been endangered by a telegram sentfrw the War Office forbidding the aeroplanes ,to meve.Air Marshal Trenchard explained that it was proposedthat the aeroplanes should land at the aerodromes two or three times a week.    The Arabs would be given certain duties inregard to looking after the petrol stores.    In addition, itwas proposed that the aeroplanes should mark out the &quot;desertroute&quot; to Mesopotamia.    Once an aeroplane service    on thedesert route was established it would have a very salutary effect upon the Arabs.    The worst that could happen might bethe assassination of mechanics left at the aerodromes.    Itwas not proposed, however, to leave more personnel in Trans-Jordania than could b^ removed in a crisis by the aeroplanes.
It was generally agreed that the proposed aeroplaneservice between Ludd and Amman was not inconsistent with thedecision of the Cabinet above referred to.    The institution of the &quot;desert route&quot; raised, however, political issues ofimportance which required careful consideration.In reply to the Secretary of State for India, theSecretary of State for th   Colonies assured the conference that his proposals really involved a diminution rather than an increase of our responsibility respecting Trans-Jordania.Further, the arrangements had been made with the expressintention of excluding any extension of Zionist activity intoTrans-Jordania.    Abdullah had been satisfied in this respect and had promised to give us his support.    Mr Churchill urgedthat he might be given reasonable latitude in this matter.    Itwas essential to retain the friendship of Abdullah, and thesch^v-e -p0r administering Trans-Jordania by means/f british political Officers was merely an application of the principle which was being introduced on a larger scale in Mesopotamia.The establishment of the &quot;desert route&quot; between mesopotamia and Egypt offered important strategical and political advan-tages, and, besides very materially shorteningthe journey to mesopotamia, would tend to keep the desert tribes friendly to us,The Secretary of State for War informed the conference that he had had no opportunity of consulting his military advisers on the proposals, and that he felt obliged tosatisfy himself that there was no serious risk of the pro-pos^ls involving us in fresh military commitments.The Conference agreed(a) That, after consultation with his military advisers, the Secretary of State for war should notify the Secretary of State forthe Colonies with the least possible delay ifhe was satisfied that there was no substantial military objection to thefollowing arrangements:(b) That the proposals of the Secretary ofState for the Colonies relative to theemploye^nt of aeroplanes for the purpose
of--yi.el.ting and supporting Abdullah shouldbe sanctioned,  on the understanding thatthe aeroplane service would be restricted to flights between ludd and Airman and the.    other aerodromes to be established in Trans-Jordania:(c) That the larger question of the use of aeroplanes for the purpose of establish-ing and maintaining the &quot;desert route&quot;between Egypt and Mesopotamia should befurther considered by the Cabinet on alater date.SUBSIDIES ^0 (2) ?.m th r^erence to Cabinet 14 (21), Conclusion 5 (e)KRPB CHIXPS.the Secretary of State for the Colonies gave the conference a general appreciation of the present position of the moreimportant Arab rulers in the Arabian Peninsula.Ibn Saud. The immediate question requiring settlement related to the subsidy payable to Ibn Saud, whose control of thefanatical Wahabi Arabs made it most important that friendly relations should be raaintained.    Not only could Ibn Saud bevery troublesome in the Heiaz, but at any moment he might provoke serious disorders in Mesopotamia.    Sir Percy Coxhad suggested that the present subsidy payable to Ibn Saudof  60,000 per annum should be increased to  120,000 perannii&quot;,    ^e (Mr Churchill)  suggested, however,  that  100,000per annum, payable rronthly in arrear and conditional on good behaviour, would be sufficient (Paper CP.-2753).    Sir percy cox was interviewing Ibn Saudis emissaries on April 13th,and it waa most important that he should be able to make some definite offer on that date.ring Hussein. With regard to the subsidy payable to King Hussein,the Conference were informed by Mr Churchill that we seemedto be moving towards a Shereefian system in Arabia.    Whileit was impossible to guarantee that this system would be successful, the character and capacity of the members ofthe Shereefian Warily afforded grounds for hope.    KingwussA^n was in very serious difficulties owing to the break-down of the Hejaz Railway.   The absence of pilgrims meant that the Heiaz Tribes were much impoverished, and King
Buaaerin. jaad^tteen- obliged- -to--find  180,000 in the last yearto assist them.    A subsidy of less than  100,000 a yearcould not -well be offered, and this compared with thesubsidy of  000,000 a month paid during the War and 25,000 a month paid at the time when payment was suspended-nine months ago.The Idrisi It was proposed to give subsidies of  1,000 andand the Imam,, 2,000 a month respectively to the Idrisi and the Imam.It was most desirable to res-are friendly relations withthe latter.    At present the garrison of Aden was costingthe country  1,000,000 a year,  and it might be possible to -effect very substantial reductions if, as part of a generalscheme, Aden was taken over by the Imperial Government,India assuming a proportion of the financial burden.    ByJoining Aden to Somalxland it would be possible to estab-lish a small aeroplane service which could control bothshores of the Straits of B-Vbel !I?yadab.In conclusion, Mr Olmrchill informed the conference that the total subsidies proposed would not amount to 300,000 per annum, and it would only be possible to reducethe  30.0-0,0 W military expenditure in the Middle East to less than  94003,000 next year by giving some latitude inthe matter of subsidies and by providing a substantial sum for intelligence service.In reply to a question by Mr Chamberlain as to the -livelihood o^ India bearing her share of the Middle Eastexpenditure,  the Secretary of State for India reminded the Conference that hi3 assent to the compromise effectedwhen the question was last under consideration had been expressly given on the understanding that it would besubject to the concurrence of the Government of India.    Hehad recently received the objections of the Indian Goverrcaerto any proposals involving L-ne payment in peace-time of a subsidy to King Hussein, these objections being due toreligious difficulties.    Personally he did not entirely
agree with the Omrernment nf Tndia in thia matter, and thought that it would be quite easy to earmark the Indiancontribution to non-controversial expenditure.    The proposed transfer of Aden would probably require legislation,    Sofar as he personally was concerned he would favour a generalarrangement under which Aden was transferred to the ImperialGovernment and India made a financial contribution towardsMiddle East expAnditure proportionate to her interests inthat part of the world.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed generally  with the proposals und-r--review., but &quot;felt-very doubtful whether the proposed sues idles were not on an alto-gethor extravagant scale.    In the case of Ibn Saud it had recently been proposed to reduce the subsidy of  60,000 perannum, and Sir Percy Cox&apos;s suggested  120^000 per annummeant giving Ibn Saud the same subsidy as was paid to the amir of Afghanistan.Mr Chamberlain agreed with Lord Curzon, and thoughtther^ was very err eat danger in agreeing to such large subsidy-dies, particularly having, regard to the difficulty of bringinthe payments to an end.    With regard to Ibn Saud he thoughtthat the difficulty could best be removed by caking him a lump sum grant in addition to his subsidy during the presentyear.    Ke did not so much object to the aggregate amount involved as to the principle of paying large su: s to theseneedy Arab rulers who might easily be bought far above their real value.With regard to King Hussein, the Conference were reminded that, during the War, engagements had possibly been entered into with the French and Italians under which theymight wiuhy to participate in any subsidy granted,and that it, was important to cloar up the position before any final decision was taken.The Conference agreed&apos; (a) That the Secretary of State for the colonies should inform Sir Percy Cox of the natureof the objections to the Increase of thesubsidy of  60,000 per annum now paid to
Ibn Baud, pointing out in particular thata lnrger subsidy would set the scale forother cases, and reminding him that evenin the case of the At:., ir of Afghanistan a subsidy of  120,000 per annum had beenfound sufficient and that this sum had only been reached after many years:(b) That at th^ same ti e Sir Percy Cox shouldbe authorised to offer Ibn Saud (a) thecontinuance on present ten s of the subsidy of  60,000, and (b) a lump sum of  20,000in respect of the present year   payable(at Sir Percy Cox&apos;s discretion) eitherimmediately or by instalments:(c) That the question of the subsidy to begranted in future to King Hussein shouldbe further considered by the Secretary ofState for the Colonies and the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs in consulta-tion, on the understanding that the subsidy should not exceed that grantedto Bin Saud.(d) That the Secretary of State for the colonies should cnnsult with the Secretary of Statefor India on the questions of the proposed transfer of Aden and the amount of thepayment which the Government of India might properly be requested to contribute to theMiddle Eastern expenditure:(e) That, a^ter such consultation, the Secretaryof State for India should communicate to theGovernment of India the views expressed atthe meeting, and should endeavour to persuadethat Government to accept a scheme under whichthe responsibility for Adon would be trans-ferred to the Imperial Government and india would make a real and serious annual eontri-button to Middle Eastern expenditure commen-commensurate with h^r interestsaGRANT OF (3) The Conference were inform -d by the Secretary ofFINANCIALASSISTANCE     State for the Colonies that he had taken upon himself toTO ABDULLAH 8authorise the High Cou-m commissioner for Palestine to make a payment of  5,000 to Abdullah to enable him to meet hiscurrent expenses.    It would undoubtedly    be necessary tomake **urthcr payments to Abdullah, the amount of which would need- further investigation.The Conference took note of and approved the action of the Secretary of State forthe Colonies in authorising Sir Herbex-tSamuel to make the payment of  5,000 toAbdullah in aid of his current expenditure.The Secretary of State for the Coloniesundertook to approach the Treasury witha view to the requisite covering sanctionbeing obtained &quot;for this payment, and also
to consult with the Chancel10:0 or theExchequer as to   the amount o&apos;;f unafuture payments to be mad^ to Abdullah^&apos;Hri fcfthall Gardens,  S.&quot;*&apos;.l,April 11, 1921.

Inter-Allied 1. With reference to H.A.C. 50, Minute 6, the Committee had ^re-of under consideration a Memorandum by the Minister of Pensions,Disabled Men CP. 2708, in which it was reported that the Inter-Allied Committeeon the Care of Disabled Men had rejected the suggestion submittedby the British delegates, on the instructions of the Home AffairsCommittee, that the functions of the Inter-Allied Committee shouldbe transferred to the Health and Labour Sections of the League ofNations.The Minister of Pensions was of opinion that the decision of theHome Affairs Committee should be maintained, and proposed thatthe British rej)representatives should be withdrawn from the Inter-Allied Committee.It was explained to the Committee that the Ministry of labour would concur in this arrangement on the understanding that theywere not committed to agreeing to the tr msfer to the League ofNations of the whole of the functions exercised by the Inter-AlliedCommittee, and that such functions as were not transferred wouldlapse.The Committee accordingly agreed To request the   Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, inconsultation with the Minister of Pensions (1.) To inform the French and American governments that the British Government sees no reason tocontinue to send representatives to the Inter-Allied Committee and Conference ;(2.) To take the necessary steps to call the attentionof the League of Nations to the action taken,and to intimate the willingness of the BritishGovernment to supply the Health and LabourSections of the League with all the informationnecessary to enable them to discharge such ofthe duties of the Inter-Allied Committee asthey may take over.Electricity 2. With reference to H.A.C. 7.9, Minute 1, aud H.A.C. 78,Supply Bill. Minute 2, the Committee had under consideration a Memorandum bythe Minister of Transport, CP. 2682, relating to the draft of a Bill,CP. 2163, to amend &quot; The Electricity Supply Act, 1919.&quot;The Parliamentarj&apos; Secretary to the Ministry of Transport statedthat at the request of the Chairman he had consulted the Leader ofthe House and the Chief Whip, and had explained that the Govern-ment were pledged to introduce the Bill this Session. Lord EdmundTalbot had asked for further time to consider the matter.The history of the matter was as follows : As explained in Memorandum CP. 2123 covering the first draftof the Bill, the Bill which resulted in the 1919 Act had producedconsiderable opposition in the House of Lords, and on considerationof the Lords&apos; amendments the House of Commons were informed thatthe proposals which the Lords had struck out of the Bill would beput forward as an amending Bill in the following Session (1920).When this new Bill was introduced, however, it became clear that itwould be highly controversial, and it was withdrawn. In the present bill, which it had been hoped would be non-controversial, thecontentious clauses have been dropped and the Bill as amended and approved by the Home Affairs Committee (H.A.C. 79, Minute 1)had been introduced in the House of Commons as a matter of format the end of the preceding Session (1920), with a promise to re-introduce it this year. The main purpose of the Bill was to conferupon the new electricity authorities and authorised undertakerscertain financial powers without which the Electricity Commissionerswere unable to proceed with the work of setting up authorities.
Valuation and 3. The Committee had under consideration a Memorandum byEating Reform. the Minister of Health (CP. 2649), in which were summarisedproposals for the reform of the existing systems of valuation and rating in England and Wales.It was explained in the Memorandum that it was recognisedthat it would not be practicable to introduce legislation during thepresent Session, but it was desired to obtain general approval fromthe Cabinet to the proposed scheme of reform in order that steps might be taken to obtain the agreement of the local authorities andother organisations concerned.The Minister of Health explained that the proposals had beenprepared in consultation with the Treasury and the Board of InlandRevenue, and had received the concurrence of the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer. He suggested that a small Committee should beappointed to examine the principles involved. In his view theproposals were of so complicated a character that the preparationof the necessary Bill would not be completed before the end ofthe year.The Committee agreed  To request the following Committee &quot;to examine and report tothe Home Affairs Committee on the proposals of theMinister of Health : The Minister of Health (in the Chair).The Home Secretary.The Secretary for Scotland.The Financial Secretary to the Treasury.The First Commissioner of Works.The Attorney-General or Solicitor-General.As the law now stood the new electricity authorities would haveno financial powers. They could not be established without such powers, and as a result the Electricity Commissioners were beingcompelled unwillingly to give sanction to uneconomic extensions ofexisting undertakings because they were unable to proceed with theschemes of setting up the new electricity authorities. They were met at every step with the objection that a scheme could not be sanctioned because there were no financial powers. The LondonCounty Council, nine of the London Electricity Companies and160 local authorities had for the first time since 190-5 come together and produced a joint technical scheme with a large measure ofagreement on the administrative side, on the faith of the Billbecoming law, and if the opportunity were lost such a generalagreement might not be obtained for a generation. On the otherhand, the hope that the Bill would prove non-controversial had notbeen fulfilled, owing to dissatisfaction in a certain quarter in theHouse of Commons. The opposition was not, however, widespread,and would receive little support.The Committee were impressed with the desirability of pro-ceeding with the Bill if possible, but at the same time, having regardto the congestion of business, were of opinion that it must not beallowed to prejudice the decision of the Government that thereshould be no autumn Session.The Committee agreed -To recommend to the Leader of the House that, having regardto the clear pledge to introduce the Bill and the urgent necessity for it, it was desirable that it should be passed this Session, but at the same time to record their con-currence with the decision of the Cabinet that an autumn session must be avoided.
&quot;Venereal Disease. 4. The Committee had under consideration a Memorandum bythe Minister of Health (Paper No. CP. -2692) on the policy to be pursued with regard to the prevention of venereal disease..The Committee concurred in the recommendations of theMinister of Health contained in the concluding paragraphof the Memorandum.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,March 24, 19-1.o
