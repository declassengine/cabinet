RAILWAY   BILL.      (11)-WLtlr-referenoe&quot;to--CaMLnetr^-(20), Conclusion 2, andFU^fRE TRAl-IS--CatoJLnet 16 (21), Conclusion 3, the Cabinet resumed thePORT policy.discussion of the question of the Railway   Bill.    In thisconnection they had before them the following documents a Note by the Minister of Labour, dated november 15, 1920, summarising recent events In conn-ction with Workers&apos; Con-trol in Factories in Italy (paper C.P.-2097):A Note by the Minister of Labour, dated november 27, 1920, containing Notes on french, Italian and certain other foreignschemes for giving effect to the princi-ple of the Workers&apos; share in the Manage-ment of Industry (Paper CP.-2190):A Note by the Minister of Transport, dated&quot;December 21, 1920, on&apos;the Workers&apos;  share in the Management of Industry in certainfereign countries (Paper C.P.-2353):Memoranda by the Minister of Transport,dated April 12, 1931, on the RailwayBill, 1921 (Papers 0,P.-2819 and 2831.Composition The first of the matters raised in these documents of DistrictBoards of the question of the inclusion of representatives of theManagement,workers on th** District Eoards of Management of each of thenew groups 0*&quot; railways to be set up under the Railway Bill,1921,    In this connection the Government, in the outline sfproposals published with the approval of the Cabinet, havestated their view &quot;that the time has arrived when the workers- both officials and manual workers - should have some(Cmd.787).voice In th** management&quot;^   The proposal, whiehwa-?  strongly,   , , ., , A    ,-considerable    ...supported by the raxlwaymen, has met with     y      opposition from the Railway Companies and shareholders,while the Federa-tion of British Industries,though divided on the main issue,recommend that an equal number of traders should be includedon the Board.The Minister of Transport made a full statement ofthe issue be-^or^ the Cabinet, irvthe course of which he gave a nurrber of instances,from the experience of the Ministry ofTransport, of the good results already obtained from giving\     the men&apos;s representatives access to statistical information        bearing on the questions affecting Labour.
The second question raised was in regard to V/agesand Working Conditions.    The published proposal of theGovernment was to provide by the Bill a permanent machinery to deal with questions of railway wages and working condi-tions, on the lines of the two Boards which have beenestablished temporarily by agreement, namely, the CentralY/ages Board, consisting of equal numbers of managers and men,with an appeal to the National Wages Board, consisting of-5-Wages andWorkingConditions.^ -politicaiy.. economic and industrial   and having takeninto consideration the position in Prance and Italy, theCabinet agreed  (a) That the adoption of methods which would ensure the workers on the railways havingaccess to information regarding the rail-ways should provide one of the best possi-ble guarantees for guod relations between employers and employed on the railways:(b) That this could best be achieved by theadoption of the Minister of Transport&apos;proposal to include 6 representatives ofthe workers on the Boards of Managementprovided for under the new Railway Bill(comprising 21 members):(c) That the proposal to include 3 officials of the Railway Companies on each board should be dropped:(d) That, in the interests of the community,a Government representative should be nominated by the Minister of transport to the Board of Directors for each groupRailway:(e) That the Railway Bill should be intro-duced in Parliament the following week,and that the Minister of Transport should notify this decision to the negotiating committee of Railway Managers and inform them that they must give him an answerby Thursday next, with a view to animmediate completion of the negotia-tions:    .(NOTE. .RY THE LSRD PrIVy SEAL:  &quot;This is now impossible, owingto the Speaker&apos;s resignation and necessity for proceeding with Budget&quot;.)(f) That, in explaining the provision in theBill for workers&apos; representation on the boards of Management, the Minister shouldbe careful to discriminate between thecharacter of the railway industry, whichworks under precise statutory regulation,and other forms of industry, e.g,, coal,which are subject to unrestricted competition.
four managers, four men.and four- users of the railway, withan impartial.. Chairman.&apos;The Railway Companies and shareholders, however, con-sider this proposal inconsistent with the policy of handingback the railways to be managed by their owners on the basisof private enterprise, and suggested a return to the basisof the system of Conciliation Scheme Boards establishedbefore the &quot;War.    In effect, the clash is, as in the coal-fields, between a national and a district settlement.The proposal of the Minister of Transport was toprovide in the Bill for a continuation, for six months ora year, of the present National and Central Wages Boardmachinery, and to provide that during a brief period theRailway Companies and the men shall be free to settle thesematters by conference among themselves, and that at theend of that period, failing a settlement, a Royal commission shall be set up to hold a public Enquiry and to formulate ascheme.The Cabinet took note of, and generally approved,  this arrangement.(IifVALIDITY OFDIVORCESGRANT? D TO&quot;UHOPFANSIN INDIA.(12) The Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandum,circulated by the Secretary of State for India, explaining that the President of the Divorce Court had recently decidedthat the High Courts in India have no jurisdiction under theIndian Divorce Act, 1869, to make decrees dissolving marriagebetween Christians who are not in a legal sense domiciled inIndia&quot;,    that the effect of this decision vras to invalidatedivorces so granted and the re-marriages contracted on the^aitb 0* their validity:    and to illegitimatise the children of these unions  (Paper CP.-2327).The Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary of State for india should proceed with the preparation and introduction o* a Fill to validatethe divorces and the re--marriages -./iectedby the decision of the English DivorceCourt.
BXPENSES. (13)  ^ Cabinet had before them the Report of theSelect Committee on Members&apos; Expenses (255/1920), togetherwith a Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (mr chamberlain) summarising the recommendations of the SelectCommittee (Paper CP.-2776).In the course of the discussion it was pointed outthat there were objections to the various remedies whichhad been proposed to meet the difficult financial positionof certain Members(i) Free postage Eight be seriously abusedby Members officially connected with large organisations;    but some assist-ance might be rendered by allowingMembers a small specified number offranked letters per day,, or per week.(ii) The total exemption from Income Tax on members * salaries would be resented andcriticised by taxpayers with incomes ofa like amount.The proposal to grant Members, including Ministers, fre&apos;vouchers enabling them to travel between London and their-constituencies was favourably received.No decision was reached, and the subject was adjourned for farther consideration.EE GOVERNMENT    (14) The Cabinet had before them a Note by the Minister.ND WAGES.of Labour, covering a suggested statement to the publicsetting forth the policy of the Government in the matterof wage disputes (Paper C.P.-2834).The Cabinet agreed  -that the &quot;iristor of Labour should use his discretion as to the publicationo&quot;P the proposed statement, or of a somewhat briefer statement on similar lines.isi!
LARGE REDUC- (15) The Minister of Labour-called attention to the IN THE?iS3LPP following Question which was down for reply that ^af^e^rnoonLI&quot; XNG oin the &quot;buse of CommonsIl^RT) .HENRY C A V r NDIS H-B E NT IK C K -    To ash thePrime Minister whether, in view of the pro-bability of the frequent occurrence in thenear future of disputes consequent on the transition of the industries of this Country   -from a war to a peace status, he will ap-point a tribunal or commission, presided overby a chairman having the confidence of both employers and workers, to which shall beentrusted the task of deciding at whatpoint above the pre-war wage a new basisrate should be fixed and o^ arranging above that rate a sliding scale variable with thefall in prices.The Cabinet approved the following draft reply, preparedby the Minister of Lab our &quot; -Dr. MAONAMARA,,-- I have been asked to reply.The suggestion appears to assume that it is practicable to adopt some universally ident-ical and applicable method for the automaticadjustment of wages generally.    This 1 thinkis not so.    Relevant considerations to betaken into account vary considerably,   &quot;It isthe desire of the Government that the parties in each industry should discuss these mattersby joint negotiation.    To this end the Gov--rn-ment have assisted in setting up Joint Indus-trial Councils and other similar organisations;and these,  together with existing conciliation machinery, cover by far the greatest part ofindustry.    For the most part, the different industries of the country are dealing withtheir difficulties by means   op joint neg:.tia-tions of this character.    Where they fail toagree, a voluntary joint reference to theIndustrial Court is open to them, and i venture to take this opportunity to urge that employers and employed generally will see their way to adopt the method of arbitration in cases in which they have found it impossible,by ordinary negotiations,  to reach a settlementOf the very difficult questions with which theyare faced at this time.

THE INDUSTRIAL     (1) The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that thereOBIS IS.^          was no development in the industrial crisis since theipfce ..atestSituation      letter received by the Prime Minister the same mornin^ from(6 P.T5. ) .the National Union of Railwaymen and the National TransportWorkers&apos; Federation stating that, after conference with theminers, th^y had decided to strike at 10 p.m. on Fridaynex t,The Minister of Transport reported that the RailwayClerks and Locomotive Men had been in touch with the triple alliance and were considering their position.The Conference were informed that from other sources of information there was a probability that the locomotivemen would strike.The Builders&apos; Union, the Conference were informed,had also offered a sympathetic strike.The Electricians, and the General Workers, who wereaffiliated to the Transport Workers, were also expected to strike.The Conference were informed that adeqtiate arrange-ments had been made for the supply of electrical power,light, and traction for London in the event of a strike ofElectricians,,    The risk of sabotage, before the strikersleft the works, though not very probable, could not be eliminated.    The Conference were informed, however, thatthere were Naval ratings available for all theLondon Power-stations.JfRE NAVAL (3) The Conference were informed that one of the NavalATTALIONS.battalions had provided itself with ratings capable of driving its own locomotives,HE DEFENCE (3)  The Conference were informed that 40,000 men hadORCE,been reported officially as attested in the Defence Force.The fall number was undoubtedly greatly in excess ofthi s.The Conference generally agreed that, in the

OPAOAMDA.1n*oro8tB 0-p esprit de coma and eff^M^y^  the defence force should be placed in military uniform.The Secretary of State for War, while---ucoopuing, andwelcoming this view, gave warning that it would involve aconsiderable expenditure.(4). With reference to Cabinet 19 (21), Conclusion 5,the Conference again adverted to the reports that sinn feiners, strikers and Communists were enlisting with a viewto levanting with their arms.The Secretary of State for War reported that 48hours ago the General Officers Commanding had been warnedabout these reports.    The Recruiting Officers had no meansof distinguishing Sinn Feiners or Communists, but a careful watch was being kept, and reports of suspectedpersons were already being received from men in the ranks.The Conference agreed  (a) That it was inadvisable at present to enlist strikers:(b) That Commanding Officers should be in-strueted to keep in touch with the chief constables, with a view to close scrutiny of the names of enlisted men.(5) The Conference were informed that employers werenot giving facilities for enlistment by their employes.It appeared that they were not yet alive to the gravity oftv-* situation.(6) The Conference discussed at some length the ques-tions of propaganda and publicity.    Instances were given ofthe amazing ignorance of the facts of the situation and ofthe Government&apos;3 offers, even among persons such as Membersof Parliament, who ought to be well informed.    The need for very extensive propaganda and publicity was stronglyemphasized.Sir Philip Lloyd-Greame reported that some 1,700&quot;briefs&quot;, compiled by very competent writers in daily touch-2-

With reference to Conclusion 12 of the Conference of$SPARERJRIKE. &quot;ministers held on April 7th, at 12-15 p.m., the conference were informed that, up to the present, there was no information to indicate a strike in the newspaper offices.dissented fromThe view was not that if all the newspapers/ -except the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; were stopped by the Trade Unionsit would almost certainly be/Tiecessary to suppress the &quot;daily herald&quot;.BPLY TO THE (8)  The Conference discussed at so.; e length the nattireSTTBR FROM : ,   v ;&apos; J.E.

These persons would be under the orders of theGeneral O^iceis Commanding, on the analogy of correspondingappointments made during the War in connection with theadministration of the Defence of the Realm Act,    The maindifference between the present proposal.and th&quot; war arrange-ment was that the new Liaison Officers would not wear uniform and would, not be under military law, as they had been duringthe &quot;^ar,&apos; This question was reserved for futureconsideration.

W INDUSTRIAL      (1) With r^er^nce to Cabinet 22 (21), Conclusion 1,  theDISPUTE.         Prime Minister informed his colleagues that, after theIbe Primejjtinis t er&apos; s Cabinet meeting on the previous day, he had received a letterLrrespond-Ince with       from Mr j.h* Thomas and Mr Cramp,    Some answer had obviouslylr J.H.thomas and Mr Crai:p.been necessary, and he had therefore been obliged to depart,in th^ letter though not in the spirit, fron the Cabinet&apos;decision.The Conference agreed in the course takenby the Prime Minister.(Both letters will.be.found in annexes I and II.)-1-
(8) with reference to Cabinet 22 (21), Conclusion 1, inorder that the facts of the situation might be brought home to the miners prior to the important Delegate Conference tobe held next week, the Conference generally agreed in princi-ple in the advisability of an arresting statement being issued in the Sunday newspapers, which are widely read bythe mining community,  stating the truth in regard to thefinancial condition of the mining industry.    In this con-nectien attention was called to a useful statement published in the &quot;Birmingham Post&quot; on the previous day.The main question for consideration was sne of prin-ciple^ as to who should issue such a statement.    The import-ance was felt of avoiding any action by the Government whichcould be distorted into a suggestion that they were takingsid^s In the disnuhe in support of the mine-owners.The Conference agreed  That Sir Philip Lloyd-Greame should arrangefor the publication of a statement in the sunday newspapers emphasizing such facts asthe tremendous break in prices,  the lack of markets abroad,the extent of American corn-petition, the importance to our financialand industrial position of coal produced at prices which enable -us to compete suo-cessfhlly with other nations in exportsboth of coal and manufactured goods, theeffect of this on wages costs p^r ton of coal at different periods, and the feetthat a temporary settlement would be of little or no value.%

ANNEX    III.Received by telephone at 10 Downing Street, atlie 50 a.m. April 16th 19 1,The Jeint Conference cf the National Union of Railwayman,Transport workers, and Locomotive and Firaniens1 Union, ha3found itself compelled to cancel the strike notices for thewithdrawal of the labour of their respective member3 at andfrom 10 p.m, Friday, April 15th 1921.&quot;.In consequence of the confusion which oonfrontod theConference or. Friday morning no reasonable hope romained ofsecuring the spontaneous and united action of the threebodies whioh was so essential to give to the Miners federation the assistance they sought.       A partial and hopelesslyincomplete sympathetic stoppage would have weakened tho powerof the throe organisations without contributing any material assistance to the miners.Up tc Thursday evening, there was every hope of a tremendous display of working olass solidarity, but circumstance-stances which have transpired since that time have destroyed the firm ground on which the call for strike action was based.Tho Conference profoundly regrets the creation of the changed situation.      No other course was open to it than toarrive reluctantly at the conclusion to call off the strike of its members.
