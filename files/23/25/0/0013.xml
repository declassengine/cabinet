HoATION. (1) W4th xef&quot;erence to Cabinet 23 (21), Appendix...IV,- theCabinet had. before them a Memorandum circulated by thePresident of the Board of Trade, at the Prime Minister&apos;3request, setting forth the present situation as to coal supplies, with special regard to the moment when completeexhaustion would arise (Paper CP.-2875).The Cabinet took note that the Chairmanof the Supply and Transport Committee had arranged with Mr Churchill, the Chairmanof the Priority Supply Sub-Committee, tohave the question examined in the first in-stance by his Sub-Committee,    Mr Churchillhoped to be in a position to report to theCabinet on the following day.loARP OP (2) With reference to Cabinet 25 (21), Conclusion 2, the[CONTROL. Cabinet were informed that the Liquor Control Board was anxious to be represented in Parliament, preferably bysomeone who took a regular part in their discussions.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Home Secretary should consultSir John Redder, the Chairman of the liquor Control Board, as to the accept-ability of Sir Samuel Hoare, M.P., forthis duty:(b) That, subject to a satisfactory reply,the Lord Privy Seal should give an invitation-tation to Sir Samuel hoare.REPARATIONS (?) With reference to Cabinet 28 (21), Conclusion 3,*w G^MANJV.Mr Montagu, on behalf of the Cabinet Committee appointed on the previous evening, presented the following Reports:-(i) An analysis of the German proposals(See Appendix I),(ii) Proposals,drafted   on the Prime Minister&apos;instructions,  in regard to the attitude tobe adopted by the Allies, which the PrimeMinister suggested as the basis of a des-patch to the&quot;United States of America(See Appendix II.)
The Cabinet agreed that paragraph 7 of Appendix ii should be modified in the direction of varying the relation between the  fixed annuities and the variable annuities,basedon Ce.rm.an prosperity, provided for in the Paris Agreement ofJanuary 29 A  1921.    The minimum annuity was to be    one of 100,000,000, with a variable annuity calculated as  an appro-priate percentage on German exports.They also agreed to omit the last four lines of para-graph B,  providing that decisions should be taken by a rnajorit;of the proposed Tribunal,  and should be binding on all parties the first part of paragraph 0, proposing that the United Stateof America should be invited to appoint a member to the Tribunwas retained.It was further agreed that paragraph 10 should be re-drafted in order to make it clear that,, while the intention was to give Germany the benefit of a favourable decision inthe dispute as to how far she has already paid the sums dueby toy 1, 1921, she should not be credited in the aggregateliability with the  100,000,000 already paid over;    and alsoto assume that, apart from the cost of the Armies of Occupatiothere were no arrears due on May 1, 1921.The Secretary of State for the Colonies asked that his view might be recorded that in these new suggestions theBritish Government were still trying to extract from Germany,in the way of reparations, more than it was possible to obtain:He also expressed misgivings as to the economic soundnesso^ the system of collecting reparation from the importer ofGerman goods.
The Cabinet agreed that paragraph 7 of Appendix ii should be modified in the direction of varying the relation between the  fixed annuities and the variable annuities,basedon German prosperity, provided for in the Paris Agreement ofJanuary 29,  1921.    The minimum annuity was to be    one or 100,000,000, with a variable annuity calculated as  an appro-priate percentage on German exports.They also agreed to omit the last four lines of para-graph C provi diner that decisions should be taken by a major! t;of the proposed Tribunal, and should be binding on all parties the first part of paragraph 0, proposing that the United Stateof Air-erica should be invited to appoint a member to the Tribunwas retained.It was further agreed that paragraph 10 should be re-drafted in order to mahe it clear that, while  the intention was to give Germany the benefit of a favourable decision inthe dispute as to how far she has already paid the sums dueby toy 1, 1921,  she should not be credited in the aggregateliability with the  100,000,000 already paid over;    and alsoto assure that, apart from the cost of the Armies of Occupatiothere were no arrears due on May 1, 1921.The Secretary o^ State for the- Colonies ashed that his view might be recorded that in these new suggestions theBritish Government were still trying to extract from Germany,in the way of reparations, more than it was possible to obtain:He also expressed misgivings as to the economic soundnessof the system of collecting reparation from the importer ofGerman goods.
&amp;n the----:O^i0rnri8axf,&apos;&apos;&quot;the Oskrli^V-w&amp;zer reminded that theGern^t^o^vwrirT%nt-was not-opposed to this method of eollectingreparation, which was most ad-antsgeous inasmuch as it enabled the creditor countries to collect in their own currencies.While, no doubt, trade was interfered with so long as thearrangement was applied as a penalty, this difficulty wouldbe removed if the German Government decided to adopt the ar-ran??eTPent voluntarily, and by such adoption exchange difficul-ties would be overcome.    Moreover, if the arrangement was putinto force by agreement, it would always be open to the creditorcountry to impose a lower rate than 50 per cent.    The suggestionthat the plan involved the use of very elaborate machinery wasrepudiated,  and stress was laid on the advantages of the schemeover the alternative arrangement of requiring actual importersof German goods all over the world to remit a proportion ofthe value of their purchases to the national Treasuries.A suggestion was made that, as the German offer was not regarded as wholly out of court as a basis for discussion,  asecond series of proposals should be framed, taking the Germanoffer rather than the Paris Agreement as its starting&apos;points,Having regard to the present state of French publicopinion and the difficulty of the German Government in agreeing to anything acceptable to the Allies in view of German publicopinion,  the general lines adopted by the Cabinet Committeewere preferred.given inReasons wore / support for the French proposals for allied participation in German industry, but objection was raised to such participation on the grounds that it would be undesirable that a large number of people in Great britain should be Interested in German industrial concerns.    Wot. only would the arrangement lead to speculation,- but it might havethe effect of giving German industry an undue preferenceover British Industry.    Moreover, the German industrialistsno doubt favoured the plan, because they thought that if asubstantial percentage of the profits of German industry went
abrmvd, ^oT^^n-eomrrrtrl-ea would har e a direct interest irresisting any Go^tministic tendencies in Germany.    It was most undesirable that foreign Governments should have any interest which might involve their interference in German domesticpolitics.    It should also be realised that German industry could only pay the foreign shareholder in paper marks, whichwould he of little value.The Cabinet were reminded that two factors had to betaken into account.    French public opinion would not tolerateany more long discussions.    The French Government had semereason for their contention that German offers had not sub-stanttally advanced since the Treaty of Versailles.    It was certain that V. Briand  could not accept the German proposals and that. i.f he did so he would be turned out of office andsucceeded by       Poir-caref.    This would be deplorable at thepresent juncture.    Secondly, German public opinion had tobe taken into account.    The German Government were not freeagents., and however much they might be willing to negotiate on. t.v,e basis of the Paris terms their public opinion would refuse permission.    It was quite possible  that the Paris ternsmight work out in practice more favourably to Germany than was at present contemplated, and it could not be contended that if the French were prepared to accept the Britishcounter proposal, with the alteration of&quot; Clause 7,  it was unreasonable to address the counter proposal to germany as an ultimatum.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That Sir L. Worthing ton &quot;Evans should re-draft the Memorandum in Appendix II onthe lines indicated by the Cabinet,  dis-cussion, and that this should be  adoptedby the British representatives as their general instructions at the forthcoming conference with the Allies:(b) That Sir I.. Worthing ton *vans and mr churchill should obtain from k.Loucheura copy of the French proposals and examine them in consultation with expertsas required.    They were authorised tocommunicate to M. Jaspa.tr the Britishplan referred to in (a)  above:
(c) To take note that, in the event of forcibleaction against Germany resulting from theforthcoming. International Conference, theBritish Government were not at presentcommitted to partipate beyond showing theFlag.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,April 27, 1921.
Appendix I.,.oy&quot;ort of Cabinet Committee on German Proposals..V:e have eoaa?obtained very carefully the proposition madeby the German Ooverar-rient to tho United States Government.It may be analysed a* follows:-1.      Tho Perrons set out what is in their opinion themaximuri payment which Is rithin Germany&apos;s economic copacityand state the conditions subject to which Germany could paysuch amount and suggest certain methods of payment.2.      If the Allies do not agree that these proposals representthe maximum which it is in Germany&apos;s power to pay, the GermanGovernment suggests that hoe question of what Germany canpay should be referred to a Commission of recognised expertsagreeable to all parties,  and declares Its willingness toaccept the decision of such a Commission as binding.5.*     The German Government desires suggestions from theunited States Govornment as to any changes in the form ofthe Gorman proposals which tho United States government considers likely te facilitate negotiations, or any other suggestions which the United States Government may care to make.The amount which Germany suggests as the maximumwithin her power is  .2,500 million gold present value.     Sheproposes to pay this amount in a series of annual paymentsaggregating  10,COO million gold.Unfortunately the German Govern; vent does not state at what rate of discount the present value of the annuitiesis calculated.      It docs not give either the period of yearsover which the annuities are spread, nor the amount of eachannuity or of any one of them.
It Is not, theimef-or-e, possible &quot;tormako -a definitecompojri^orifb-between this offer and tho Paris figures.     Buton certain assumptions the amount would not fall very farbelow the Paris figures without the 12% levy which on the5&apos;7 tables represented a present value of  4,200 million gold, but on the 3f. tables only  2,550,000,000 gold.The present value of the 12&apos;/: levy may be taken as from 700 million gold to  1,700 million gold.The total annuities under the Paris, agreementaggregated  11,300 million gold spread over 42 years *The annuities here proposed aggregate  10,000 million gold spread over an unstated period.If therefore the Treaty period of 30 years is nowintended, and the annuities are intended to be spreadfairly evenly over the 30 yeara, it is only necessary weare informed by Treasury to assume a 1% or 8% discomitrate to bring the present value of the newly proposedannuities and of the Paris annuities close togetheraIt Is probable that the German Government has inten-tionally left these important points vague in order on theone hand to satisfy Allied opinion by speaking of a seriesof annuities aggregating  10,000 million gold and on theother hand to c onoiliato German public opinion with thelow present value of  2,500 million gold*The further proposals which Germany makes for finding the money to pay the total sum Include -(a) an International loan to be specially secured on german Government assets and revenues.(b) an immediate payment in cash of  50 million goldof which  7,500,000 would be paid at once ir,specie or foreign bills and the balance of 42,500,000 within three months.
(-ol--- subject to tho assent of the-Thultod StatesofGo^o^eirnweii^^ portion of theAllied debts to the United States QoyormenW(d)    immediate tmdortuking of works of rooon-struction in the devastated districts:,Germany does not state what rate of interest she would pay on such part of tho capital amount as was notdischarged at once by the above means.    It is not certain whether in speaking of 4^ as the highest possible rate, sheis speaking of interest and amortization, or of amortizationonly sGermany further proposes to accelerate the rate ofamortization by adopting the Paris proposal of an index number of Germany&apos;s economic development, and making largeror smaller payments on account of principle in accordancewith the-movement of each index0The Allies arc thus given a share in Germany!s economic recovery, but not in the form of an increased total paymentbut only in the form cf an accelerated payment with acorresponding acceleration in the rate of Germany&apos;s finalfreedom from liability0The German proposals are as usual hedged with conditions;Including(a) release cf German private property abroad(b) abolition of sanctions(c) &quot;that the present basis cf German production is notdiminished&quot;, which presumably iofers to Upper Silesia.(d) that Germany Is again admitted to the world&apos;scommerce.(e) that Germany is freed of all unproductive expenditurepresumably Armies of Occupation &amp;c.
Of these, the Cirst, release of German private property abroad,is obscure, but probably qp.ite inadmissible..    If it means thatthe Clearing Office System for pre-war debts, &amp;c.. should be abolished it is clearly impracticable.    But most probably it Isan attempt to get the TJ.S.A. to release the German property,valued at over  l00,0&quot;&apos;0,0n0 in tho hands of  the Enemy PropertyCustodian in the U.SCA.    This is of course a matter for theU . S * A. but It is evidently a vital condition in German eyes,and both in connection with the proposed loan/in connection with theimmediate payment of  50 million gold,II. If the German suggestion ac to that the maximumGermany can p y stood alone while me should he Inclinedte regard it as a definite advance on any previous proposals put forward by Germany, we should feel compelled to repeatthat It contains too many obscurities, perhaps intentioned,and i3 hedged about by too many conditions to be  acceptableas a basis of discussion without further explanation at a mount when its main purpose ma7/ be to  secure German.y arespite eNone the less we should ha^e mdo such a repcr twith much hesitation, since there  are many features,particularly the aggregate annuities of  10,000 million gold and the suggestions  (b)   (0)  and (d) set out in pai?a,iii of our report above, which seems to us to bo full of pronise.But the offer of Germany to p accept as final thedecision of a commission of experts as to her capacity topay suggests to us that the German Government is reallyready to shoulder her just liabilities,  and. the proposalsshe makes must be considered in the light of this furtheroffer.    If Germany  could  accept tho verdict of the&quot;reparation Commission, with an American member added and give a vote, and with the Commission voting by a majority
we think that the -Brdtd^hrGovernnent would be well advised to agree to abide by suoh verdict *We do net enter into the question whether theFrench Government could or would accept such a solution.We can only say that In our opinion the proposal should not be rejected without very serious consideration.
