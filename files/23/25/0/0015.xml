$TT&apos;OT With :reference to Cabinet 29 (81). Conclusion 3    theCabinet met to consider, as a matter of urgency, the positionre-ached at the Allied Conference that evening on the subjectof Reparations by Germany.The Prime Minister reported that the Conference had beenin session for four and a half hours.    At the outset M,Briandhad talked in somewhat general terms, and there had beennothing in his statement to which objection could be taken.Later on, however, M, Jaspar had made a very definite state-merit and had revealed that the French proposal was to marchinto the Ruhr on Monday next without warning.    Questions hadbeen put,  and had elicited that Essen was to be entered within three days, and the whole of the Westphalian coalfield was tobe occupied within ten days of the order to march.    The opera-tion was to be carried out with formations already available,without waiting for the incorporation of the Class of french troops to be called up.    There was to be no parley before theoperation began, but after its completion there would be aparley and the Germans would be treated as in default.During the discussion,  the Prims Minister continued,  ithad been elicited that the Reparation Commission had justadjudicated on the amount of the German obligation.    In orderto arrive at a figure the Commission had conducted an exhaust-ive enquiry.    They had read 130 German Memoranda, and devoted30 sittings to the hearing of German delegates.    They had beenthanked by the Germans, though the thanks had afterwards been withdrawn.    The claim, as assessed, was admitted unofficiallyby the Germans themselves to he moderate, and amounted to 6,600,000,000.The Prime Minister then drew attention to the fact that .under Article 233 of the Treaty of Versailles the ReparationCommission, besides fixing the totality of Germany&apos;s payments by May 1st, had also concurrently to draw up a schedule ofpayments prescribing the time and manner for securing anddischarging the entire obligation within a period of thirty
years.      That the Commission had not yet done, as the Oor raw;hadtad declined to render then; any assistance.    M, ^riand/acceptediu Jasperfs version of the French plan and had asked for theapproval of the Conference to the immediate occupation of the ruhr.     The Prime Minister and Lord Curzon had other  made itclear that they could, not consent without co? suitingtheir colleagues in the Cabinet, and they had giver them noencouragement to think that the Cabinet were likely to ascent.In fact the Prime Minister had stated that the sanctions imposedat London had stretched our rights to their extreme limit. Toimpose additional sanctions in respect of the seme defaultsas thoso for which the London sanctions had been imposed wasnot justifiable.      To take action before tho reparations commission had notified to Germany, as prescribed by theTreaty,  the time and method of payment was equally out of thequestion.      He had recalled that the Gar had been won, notsolely by the valour&apos; of our armies but by the fact that, onthe whole, the people of the world thought the cause of theAllies was right and just.      To advance into the Ruhr withoutevery justification would be to jeopardise this position.At this point, tho Prime Minister continued, M, Briendhad observed that Germany was already in default in regardto disarmament, was criminals, and the 12 milliards due by 1st May4     Mr. Lloyd George had pointed out that in thoserespects she was in default before the London Conference,These were stale offences for which sanctions had already been applied.      It was not fair to revive them in order to exactdouble penalties.     He had then pointed out that what germany had accomplished in the way of disarmament was prodigious, anderobably she now possessed fewer guns than Belgium.     As to thatof the War Criminals, the delays were clue as much to France andBelgiumpas to Germany, who had not yet received the evidencerequired for the trials.Towards the- end M. Jaspar had retreated from his position a:had suggested that the Allies should send a note before
taking action.    M, Briand had not liked the proposal, and had made a statement in which he suggested that France would havetc act single-handed.    The Prime Minister had suggested thatin that event there wan not much to confer about,  and M.Briand had explained that he did not mean that.    M. Briandhad added that if his proposals were rejected he would haveno alternative but to go back to France and resign.    He then asked for time to consider the whole position,,Eventually it had been arranged that the Allied Expertsshould meet the same evening and consider methods of payment and guarantees.    If the Allied Experts could reach an agreement it was proposed to summon the Reparation Commission to london to consider the Report, with a view to completing their out-standing duties under Article 233 of the Treaty of Versaillesat once.Should the Reparation Commission agree,  the Allies wouldthen have the right to say to Germany,  &quot;If, within a certainnamed period, you do not accept the decision of the ReparationCommission, we shall march&quot;.Lord Curzon added to the Prime Minister&apos;s statement thatit had been made clear that, in the eventuality just mentioned,Great &quot;Britain would act with France to such extent as herresources permitted-.The suggestion was made that, in that eventuality, we mightblockade Germany.    This, the Cabinet were reminded, would depend on the attitude of the United States of America, which,it was generally thought, would be favourable.In reply to a question as to whether the Allies, if theyoccupied the Ruhr, would remain there until Germany had dis-armed, the- Prime Minister stated that this would probably bethe case.The general view of the Cabinet was &quot;that, if Germany ac-cepted the decision of the Reparation Commission in regardto reparations, it was probable some accommodation couldbe reached on the question of Disarmament.-3-
idIf, on the contrary, Germany rejected the decision ofthe Reparation Commission, the Cabinet agreed that, afterholding bach France so long, we could no longer oppose the march into the Ruhr, even though we preferred to base ourown action more on the German default in regard to Dlsarma-ment and war Criminals than on Reparation.The general lines on which the British representatives(Sir Laming Worthington Evans,  hr Montagu and Sir AlfredMond) at the forthcoming Conference of Experts the 3ameevening were to trork, were those referred to at the Confer-ence of Ministers held that morning (Appendix I), and the text is set forth in the Annex thereto.The Secretary of State for the Colonies, while agreeing that the 50 per cent, tax on imported German goods shouldnot be abandoned until full security was obtained for theBritish share of payments under the new proposals, urged thatthe Cabinet might not be asked at the present time to decidedefinitely in favour of the permanent retention of that particular system of payment.The Prime Minister agreed to  this.The conclusions cf th    Cabinet may be sur.im.ed up as  follows(a) Pull support to the attitude adopted by the-Prime Minister end lord Cursor.,, and a warroexpression of thanks for the firm line theyhad taken In the unpleasant task of refusingthe insistent demands of the French Govern-ment, which,  if accepted, might have involvedus in a very dangerous policy:(b) A unanimous opinion against the French pro-pcsals t(c) The members of the Cabinet Committee to take such opportunities as their fortheoeing Con-ferenow with the Allied Experts might offer to discuss the question of whether the Alliedproposals should be communicated to  the Repa-ration Commission, which, if it adopted them,would forward them to Germany as its owndecision, or, alternatively, whether theAllies should submit their proposals forthe United States of America to forward toGere any.Lord CAbernon reported that this latter coursewould greatly increase the prospect of their acceptance by Germany.P^all Gardens, S.G.1, .....% 1,  1921. -4-

UlTlOSf.      1.    With reference to Cabinet 29 fSl) Conclusion 3tTroposal^^J^ under--dXscusai^n^cs-^tain from.1iproposals with regard to the payment of Separation byGermany which had emerged from discussions during thelast few days between the Cabinet Committee onSeparations and M. loucheur and Colonel Theurris.Sir Laming Worthing^on-^rans gavo the Conferenoe an outline of this scheme which had not yet been reducedto writing, but copies of which it was hoped would beavailable later in the day.Tho new proposals generally oommended themselves tothe Conference, but it was very strongly represented that the scheme for collecting 50$ of tho value ofimports from Germany In cash in the importing country andearmarking the amount so collected in partial satisfactionfor that country1s reparation claims should be incorporate-ated in the new proposals.     It was pointed out that Itwould be most dangerous for Groat Britain to assent to any scheme which might have tho effect of giving franco,Belgium and Italy substantial reparation while denying itto herself, and that in the absence of most completeassurances and guarantees that Great Britain would get herfair share of Separation, no steps should be taken to give up the 50f0 scheme.The Conference were Informed that it would bepossible to incorporate the 50$ scheme in the new proposals by treating the 50$ as reparation in kind and by handing over to the German Government German yd I bonds-equivalent in value to the cash aotually collected.     The 3tU3te;estionwas made without objection being taken that the 50$ couldbe.-i i
be reduced, to 25$ if Germany voluntarily accepted this as one of the methods of paying Reparation.Objection was taken to the suggestion for including the50$ in the new proposals, on the ground that It would placeBritish traders at a disadvantage vis-a-vis German trade ascompared with traders of countries which had not imposed thepercentage arrangement.    It was also represented that if the50$ scheme was incorporated in the new proposals this should bedone in such a way that the proceeds would be credited to theCalsse la Dette and debited to the collecting country by way ofInterest9 rather than that the amount collected should be treatedas Separation in kind.   While it was generally recognised thatthis latter suggestion would in effeot provide a satisfactory method of regulating exchange, doubts were expressed as towhether such an arrangement was administratively possible.It was agreed -(i) that the 50$ on imports should not begiven up unless and until the BritishGovernment was entirely satisfiedthat the British Empire would receiveher jfair share of Reparation by someother methods(ii) that the members of the ReparationCommittee should give further consid-eration to the question of the basis on which tho 50$ scheme should be incorporated in, the proposals.A copy of the new proposals as subsequently settled by the Secretary ot State for War Is attached (See Annex).
