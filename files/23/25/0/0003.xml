ippvTSTHIAI^   (1) The LoTd-^t^-^^^^^^t^&apos;hl&amp;^^ll^a,guB3 the texto-f&quot;&quot;the-.d*K^^ by the Prime Minister to the Miners&apos;te Position6 p.re.       Pedei^ion the same morning (Appendix).The Prime Minister had explained to him that theeffect of the proposed pool was that all the ccal-miningdistricts, except the small district in Cumberland, woiildcontribute to South Wales.At this point the Prime Minister entered, and explainedthat the position was that, after separate Conferences betweenthe Government and, first the owners (11 a.m.), then the miners(1 p.m. until after 3 p.m.) and finally with the owners and miners (4 p,m.),the miners had retired to consider theirformal answer to the Government&apos;s proposal.    In his finalstatement, however, Mr Herbert Smith had made it clear thatthere was very little prospect of acceptance, and the tone ofhis whole speech, except in the unlikely event of its being afinal attempt at a bluff, seemed to indicate the probability of a strike.    Mr Smith had stated that the Government, in their proposals, were merely backing the owners.    The Prime minister had warmly repudiated this suggestion.    The Prime minister pointed out to his colleagues that the national pool merelysignified control in a most virulent form.    He and his col-leagues in the negotiations could not recommend it to theCabinet, and he felt sure that the Cabinet would not recommend it to Parliament.    The Prime Minister gave his colleagues afull resume of the objections to the system of a pool, as given in his final speech to the mine-owners and miners atthe 4 p,m. meeting.:fi MOBIXISA-       (2) With reference to Cabinet 18 (21) Conclusion 7, them OP AR-ifGEMFNTS Cabinet further considered the question of issuing instructionsI a.  STRIDEn^rw T^xprw -Tor putting in operation the whole of the measures concerted&amp;IANC*.to meet the contingency of a strike of the Triple Alliance.SiAfter full enquiry, it was elicited that but littleadvantage would be gained by issuing these instructionstonight rather than tomorrow morning.
In view of the possibility of action still being taken by the Railwaymen and Transport Workers to bring about a continuance of negotiations, or, alternatively, of their declining to strike, the Cabinet felt that any action which might be regarded and quoted afterwards as provocative should be avoided. They agreed --

That the instructions should not be issued for the present.

?EEPING OPEN ? TELEGRAPH OFFICERS AND ? ANKS.

(3) With reference, to Cabinet 16 (21). Conclusion 9, the Cabinet were informed, that arrangements  had not yet been made for keeping open telegraph offices until a late hour, nor for the Managers to remain late at the provincial branches of the Banks to which the Strike books had been sent.

A message  was received from the Secretary to the Post Office, asking for instructions.

In view of the preceding Conclusion, the Cabinet agreed --

That it was unnecessary to keep the telegraph offices open beyond the normal hour.

?OTICE TO RAILWAYMEN ? AND OTHER TRANSPORT WORKERS.

(4) With reference to Cabinet 18 (21), Conclusion 8, the Cabinet further considered the question of sending a press notice, notifying the intention of the Government to do their utmost to safeguard railwaymen and other transport workers who remained loyal.

It was now too late to get the notice into this evening&apos;s a newspapers, but it was generally felt to be of importance to issue it in the morning newspapers of the following day, in the event of a strike, of the railwaymen.

The Cabinet agreed --

That the Home Secretary and the Secretary for Scotland should send the message on receipt of instructions  from the Prime Minister.

THE DEFENCE FORCE.

--

Danger from Sinn Feiners and Winers.

(5) With reference to Cabinet 18 (21), Conclusion 10, the Secretary of State for War informed the Cabinet that the numbers enlisted in the Defence  Force up to 5 p.m. this evening amounted to 28,000.


2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,April 12, 1921.I *The Gabinet invited the attention of the Secretaryof State for War to information received by the Home Secre-tary to the effect that a number of Sinn Feiners were enlist-ing in the Defence Force with a view to deserting with their arms.    The possibility was suggested of similar action byminers, who were reported in the Press to be enlisting.They commended to Sir Lairing Worthing ton Evans&apos; attentiona proposal that a warning should be sent to all Commands andrecruiting stations.THE PSLICY OF      (6) With reference to Cabinet 18 (21), Conclusion 2, theTHE government towards THE   Cabinet had some further discussion in regard to the eventsMINERS.leading up to the present crisis, and the possibilities, even at this late hour, of some arrangement which would remove the grievance of the miners resulting especially from the sudden drop in wages.The ground was once more explored in full detail, andthe whole situation was reviewed at some length.The Cabinet took the opportunity to express to thePrime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer its com-plete confidence in their conduct of the negotiations.THE &quot;DAILY   -       (7) With reference to Cabinet 18 (21), Conclusion 5, theHERALD &quot; .Prime Minister expressed his concurrence in the decision inregard to the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; taken at the morning Meeting.
APPENDIX to Cabinet 19 (21), held on Tuesday, 12th April 1921 at 7 p.m.

..........

1. The Miners make a demand for a National ?oul of Profits and a National Settlement of Wages. In the view of the Government one of these proposals may be practicable, the other is not.

2. That a pooling arrangement whereby the Miners and the Mine Owners in every mining area should be compelled to contribute to a common pool for the equalisation of wages in the industry without regard to the capacity of the mines in any particular area is not feasible without the resumption of complete and permanent control by the State of the Mining Industry.

3. That a purely voluntary scheme would inevitably break down even if it could be effectively  started and that is doubtful.

4. That such a strict control as is essential to a national pooling scheme would deprive these engaged in the industry, whether Miners or Mine Owners, of the necessary incentive to production: that the productiveness of the mines would thus be depressed; that the cost of production would increase; that the industry would suffer in foreign markets and that the increased cost of coal would have the effect of so adding to the cost of production in our other industries as to handicap us seriously in our foreign trade. It would deprive multitudes in this country of their means of livelihood while it would add to the cost of living for the rest.
5. That there shall b.s in each district a standard wagewhich shall be the first charge on the proceeds of theindustry in each district, and that no profits? shall&quot; be payable until the standard, wage is satisfied.    The principleor which this standard wage shall be fixed for each districtshall be d^t^r^ined nationally and the amount to be settledfor each district shall be the subject of discussion at thepresent conference.    The method of adjustment of wages ineach district in excess of the standard shall also bedetermined nationally and any complaint as to th0 adjustment in any particular district shall be referred to a national committee on which th-re shall be representatives of theCoal Owners and Miners in equal numbers.6. That in determining this 3tandsrd wage regard shouldbe had not merely to the price,       coal but to the possibili-national of improving wages by reducing the cost of production;by increased economy, efficiency, and closer co-operationhetw^er. Miners and M1no Owners.7. ,That the question of the relation of the owners1 standardprofit to the miners&apos; standard wage, and thr-. division of any surplus profits shall also be immediately examined by this conference with a vie-&quot; to determining trhnt p-rcentage theprofits of* the Coal 0&apos;ners ought to bear to the wages paidin the industry.0. If and when an arrangement has been arrived at betweenthe Coal Owners and th&quot; Miners as to the rate of wages to be paid in the industry, fixed upon an economic basis,the Govern -rt will be willing to give assistance, either byI.o;*r or otherwise, during a short period, in order torMtigafce th* rapid reduction in wages in the districts mostseverely a^^ot-d.12th April. 1921.
