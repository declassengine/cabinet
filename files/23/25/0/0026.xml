UIIFP. SILESIA.      (1) With reference to Cabinet 40 (SI), Conclusion 1,0the Cabinet had a short preliminary discussion on M, Errand&apos;proposal to appoint an Intor-Allied Civilian Commission toadvise as to the boundaries of Upper Silesia (Telegram No.313 from the British Ambassador in Parisv dated hay 24, 1921).The proposal commended itself not only as a practicalstep towards a solution of the problem, but as a means ofescaping from the existing controversial atmosphere surround-ing the question.    It was pointed out, however, that,  in the3ast resort, the decision was mainly a political one whichwould have to be decided by the Governments, or possibly, ifthey could not reach agreement, by arbitration.The subject was adjourned.IRFLAKD.Soverei gnty,Security.Fiscal Au-tonomy,(2)  With reference to Cabinet 41 (21),  Conclusion 4,  theCabinet had a full discussion as to the attitude the PrimeMinister should take up in his forthcoming interview with sir James Craig before the latter&apos;s further meeting withMr de Valera.After a prolonged dis cession the Cabinet agreed  That the Prime Minister should impress on Sir James Craig the following esson-tial elements-in the Bri.ti.sh attitudetowards a settlemeiit, t -(a) From the point of view of the navaland Military security of these islands there mast be no separateEish Navy, Army, or Air Porco,and the Irish harbours and creeksmust remain under British control:(b) That some fair financial contribution by Ireland towards Imperial expend!-ture is essential.    It is only justthat Ireland should take her share in the cost of a war in a causewhich Irish opinion favoured:    thatshe should contribute towards theNaval, Military and Air Forces on-which she might one day have to countfor her defence;    and there is no ground, by exempting Ireland from herlegitimate obligations, for conferringon her a position privileged beyond that of any country in Europe fromthe point of view of coot of living and taration

As I stated at the Cabinet,  although I am. in agreement with all. my colleagues as to the necessityof Naval and Military security for Great Britain, and alsothat Ireland must remain responsible for her fair share ofBritish indebtedness, I do not agree that it is impossible in all circumstances to permit the Irish Parliaments to placeCustoms Duties on goods of United Kingdom, origin.I am glad to think that my views are shared by many ofthose who took part in the debate last Wednesday, and I canonly hope that, noWithstanding the decision of the Cabinet,an Irish Peace will be secured.(Initialled) E.S.M.India Of f&apos;i ce,Whitehall, S.W. 1,May 30,  1921.Note, by, Mr Church!1&quot;I agree with the above, and. should be glad to have my views recorded.(Initialled) W..S.C.May 30, 1921.Note bv Mr- Fisher.I agree with Mr Montagu&apos;s note, and should like my viewsrecorded,(Initialled)- H..I F.June 2,  1921.
