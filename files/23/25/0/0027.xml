Thesubject was of transcendent importance, and he was sorry, to(2) With reference to Cabinet 26 (21), Conclusion 1, theCabinet had before them the following documents relating to
^y^hart^r/5rwljigr on a bed of sickness * be had only had an hour or two- he-fore-the wee-ting -to--make--some notes on the question with a view to putting the whole matter before tho Cabinet in a condensed form.    If, after he had made his statement,  any Minister wanted further information,he world be only too glad to give it, if they would say on what points such information--was required.    Lord Curzon thenproceeded to give to the Cabinet the history of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, beginning with the original Treaty conclud-ed by Lord Lansdowne in I9QS, and its development, throughthe second Treaty of August, 1905t to that of July, 1911,the renewal of which was under consideration.    The Treaty pro-vided not only for the maintenance of the general peace in eastern Asia and India, but also for th- continuance of theterritorial rights of the High Contracting Parties in these regions, and the defence of their special interests. It also provided for the preservation of the common interests of allPowers in China by ensuring- the independence -and integrity oftheChinese Empire   and the principle of equal opportunities for the commerce and industry of all nations in Chinac    the reference to the safeguarding of the special interests of the contracting parties raised, in his opinion, a somewhat diffi-cult question,, as it was never easy to define exactly whatsuch interests were or to agree exactly on the extent to whicha Power was interested..   His Majesty&apos;s Government had been veranxious about the application of&quot;the original Alliance in theevent of America being involved in war with Japan,&apos; and thisled to the revision of the Agreement in July, 1911, and theinclusion in its terms of Article IV,which ensured that should either High Contracting Party conclude ... Treaty of general aridtration with a third Power, nothing in the Agreement should en-tail upon such contracting party an obligation to go to warwith the Power with whom such Treaty of Arbitration was inforce. 1  This
-Article w^^lrKaud^i-in^^on&amp;eqiience- or negotiations which hadtaken-place between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Govsrn-ment of the United States regarding a general arbitration treaty between Great Britain and the United States of. America.Although the Treaty of Arbitration with America was notratified by the United States Senate, Sir Edward Grey made it quite clear to the Japanese Government that the special commission Treaty concluded with America in September, 1914,was, in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;a Government, equivalentto an Arbitration Treaty in spirit and intention, andfaccord-ingl^ that Article TV of the Anglo-Japanese Agreement was inoperation.    After the Peace Conference in Paris it had been realised that the Treaty in its existing form was not entire-ly in accordance with-the-Covenant of the League of Nations,and it had been pointed out to the Japanese Government thatif it was to be continued it must be re-drafted in such a form as would not be inconsistent with their and our ownobligations- under the&quot; terms of the Covenant.    Tho presentposition&apos;was that the question was coming before the meetingof Empire Prime-Ministers which was to take place in a very short time,  and it had been proposed to-prolong the Alliancefor a period of one year while the matter was under consid-eration.    Since, however, this proposal, although agree! toin some quarters, had not been approved in other quarters,a proposal had been made to prolong it for a period of threemonths, on the distinct understanding that if anything hap-happened during that time the contracting parties would be bound by their superior obligations under the Covenant of theLeague,Lord Ourzon then said that he proposed to summarise thearguments which had been advanced for and against the renewal of the Alliance,   He would then explain the view held by tho;who were in close touch with the matter, and would give tothe Cabinet the proposals of hie Department as to how thequestion should be dealt with.   Against the renewal of the alliance it was said,  in the first place,  that the reasons
which had, Led-originally to His Majesty5 s Government entering into the Alliance had now -ceased.to exist.    It had been firstformed as a counterpoise to an aggressive Russia in the ParRast, and the identity of our own and Japanese interests had brought us together against that Power.    It was true that russia was now disintegrated and that Germany, who had 1 aterin the day appeared as a dangerous rival in the Par East, had ceased to exist as a Great Power,    There was, consequently,force in the argument brought forward to the effect that themain reasons for the Alliance had ceased to exist.    He would,however,, later on, when he came to give the arguments on theother side, call the - attention of the Cabinet to how thepolitical situation might again change in the future.    Thesecond argument used against the renewal of the Alliance wasthat its existence was not only a source of suspicion andirritation but of actual embarrassment in the United States.It was only right to oay, however, that the cause for such a feeling had been largely removed by the insertion of ArticleIV and by the subsequent understanding   with the JapaneseGovernments to whom it had been made quite clear that GreatBritain would not go to war in order to support her in a con-conflict with the United States.    Even so,  it could not be denied that there was- considerable suspicion of the Alliance inAmerica, and it might almost be said that the United states authorities were tempted to moke it an excuse for adding totheir naval armaments.    The third argument against the renewal of the Alliance was that it was alienating from us the&apos; sympat&apos;1,of China and rendering our task there more difficult.    our policy in China had always been that of the &quot;open door&quot;.Lord Curson then proceeded to explain what an unwieldy andhelpless country China load become, and pointed out how itmust naturally be the desire of His Majesty&apos;s Government tosee China built up again and some sort of cohesion arrived ain that country.    Almost at the door of this great, helplessbodv there existed Japan, whose national temperament wa-s
9 &apos; . 301c .fi^reely--li5epeT^.aliBtio- j^rwhsre..,the Gem an spirit of dmci-plined aggression had been imbibed to a great extent.    Japanherself was incapable of maintaining more than her presentpopulation, and it was natural that she should look to China.This was the great factor in the Par Eastern world, and hewould like to remind his colleagues of the degree to which,by her action in Korea, Formosa, the Pescadores, Manchuriaand Shantung, Japan was already forming a ring round China.It would naturally be said by the opponents of the Alliancethat its renewal weald give strength to this aggressive Power,and that Great Britain was encouraging Japan&apos;s policy, which,she really ought to resist0 Those were the arguments whichhad been used against a continuance of the Alliance, and hewould now explain what, in his opinion,, were the reasons thatmight be advanced in favour of its renewal, and which, hethought, on the whole made out the stranger case.Firstly, he did not think that anyone  could doubt thatthe Alliance had proved a great and substantial success.    Ithad, at different times during..!tr existence, helped boththe contracting parties *    It had undoubtedly been of assist-.anc-e to Japan in her war with Russia, and, similarly, no-one could deny that it had benefited us considerably in the late war.    People at home, indeed, hardly realised what the Alli-ance had meant to Great Britain in the Pacific, to  say nothing of what the Japanese- had,done xn the Indian Ocean and theMediterranean.The Prime Minister,   interposing at this stage,  said thathe would like the Admiralty and the War Office to preparePapers showing the extent to which the Japanese Alliance hadrespectively assisted in the naval operations during the Warand also in supplying the Russians with war material.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, continuing,said there could be no question that the Alliance &apos;had been a success, and that this must be regarded as one argument infavour of its renewal.    The second argument in favour of its-5-
9 s a 9o y (crenewtil Vaa-&quot;th^.,^*rthough.Jhissla. orid Germany had for thmoment ceased to &quot;be Great Powers, which bed to be taken intoaccount, there was no certainty that in a few years&apos;  ti,ewe should not have a regenerated Russia;    and, whatever theform of the Russian Government might then be, the dangers ofthe past would again be revived.    Moreover, with a resuscitat-ed Russia and a revived Germany, it might wall be that in tenyears&apos; time we might be faced with a combination of these powers in the Far Fast, and to meet such a situation an alliance with Japan would be the natural guarantee.   Again,granting the aggressive character of Japan, should it not beremembered that the Alliance had given us the means of puttinga check on Japan&apos;s ambitions:    for example,  the Japanese Gov-ernment had been negotiating railway agreements with China,which had aroused suspicion on all sides; but since he (LordOurzon) had entered the Foreign Office in succession to mr balfour, the &quot;consortium&quot; of Powers had been arranged, which japan, sooner than be left in isolation, had been compelledto join.    This included. China, Great Pi5 tain, the United.States, and Prance, and Belgium as a prospective member.Once such agreement was arrived at it was -possible to tellJapan that she must fall into line with these arrangementsor else the Powers concerned would fight her commercially.The result was that Japan had agreed to co-operate, and wewere now in a position to exert pressure on her.    There was another point, from the naval end military point ef view,-andthat was that so long as the Alliance remained in force wewere absolved from maintaining large naval and military   ..forces in the Par East.    There was yet another argument infavour of a continuance of the Alliance, and that was that-it was looked on with considerable favour by our Allies.,He ventured to think that Franco, on account of her Posses-sions in the Far East, would regard with dismay any proposal on our part not to renew the Alliance,    Holland wouldunquestionably take the same view, on recount of her
m 1 i ii 31)3Poseess^ns-in-- the East Indies.,-..since- It would be a greattemptation to an unfriendly Japan to pounce on and seizethese Possessions.   Lastly, the feeling in Japan itself hadto be considered, and there was no question that the Japanessas a whole were in favour of the renewal of the Alliance.Our general experience-had-been that the Japanese werescrupulous and faithful in carrying out their obligations.No doubt, as was often said, the Japanese were not aboveintrigue, but he would like to ash if they were the onlypeople who did this?   Ke personally could not think cf asingle instance when the Japanese had not carried out theirwordeThe Lord President of the Council said that he also had always found this to be the case.i^e Lord Privy Seal referred to the negotiations which-hadtaken place in connection with reparations, and said that theJapanese-Representatives -had always behaved most loyally tous and had voted in whatever way they knew we desired.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, continuing,said that although there might be dissentients in Japan,and although they knew that the Alliance would not assist them, in a war with America, he himself had no doubt that thegreat addition which the Alliance gave to their prestigemade Japanese statesmen predisposed to favour its renewal.He would like to ask what would happen if the Alliance wasnot renewed?    It would create, in his opinion, great disappointment -polntment, and the Japanese would at once say, &quot;What have wedone to be so treated?1&apos;    There would be considerable resent-ment in Japan, and if a spirit of retaliation developed theJapanese might make themselves very objectionable,    TheBritish Ambassador at Tokio had written that Japan was astrong Power, almost less troubled by internal affairs than any other nation, and one which, in a few years, would be^stronger still.    If they were not our Allies, then th?y woulpbe decidedly hostile.    The question was,  could we afford, to-7-
risk that hostility?    The Japanese were ready to accept any modifications.rather than drop the Alliance.He had given a summary of the principal arguments whichhad been used for and against the renewal of the Treaty , andhe now proposed to give to the Cabinet the opinion of those authorities who had examined the question.    He would like tocall attention to Papers which had been circulated in theprevious year by the Admiralty and the War Office, &quot;both ofwhich Departments had expressed themselves in favour of a renewal of the Treaty in a modified form, and had given thai;reasons for advocating such a course.    Lord Gurzon thenreferred to a Paper which had been prepared by the Committeeof Imperial Defence in May, 1911, and to a speech which had recently been made by Mr Hughes, the Prime Minister ofAustralia.    Somewhat to his surprise, Mr Hughes was strongly; in favour of its renewal, and Mr Massey also took the same view, although he (Lord Curzon) had. not expected him to&apos; doso.    In fact, the Prime Minister of New Zealand had saidthat we had a good deal to go&quot;&apos;ny and nothing to lose, byrenewing the Treaty,    He did not know what view was heldin South Africa regarding its renewal.    On the other hand,Canada was frankly hostile..    This was only natural,  as theywere thinking of th^ir own interests, living, as they did,side by side with the United States of America;    and everyday one saw how everything in Canada was influenced by theirclose touch with their southern, neighbour.    People in Canadswere also profoundly affected by the question of Japaneseimmigration on the West Coast, and were painfully impressed with Japan&apos;s attitude in Korea.    These considerations had led the Prime Minister of Canada to propose, as a substitut-for the renewal of the Alliance, the holding of a Conferencof Pacific -Powers as a solution of the question.Lastly,lord Curzon said he would like to refer to atelegram, and despatch which had recently been-received fror,-ep-
the British Ambassador at. Washington.,   One would have e-pect-ed that Sir Auckland Geddes&apos; view would be influenced by thefact that he was at Washington, but he took the view, however,that the Alliance should be continued.    Lord Curzon then readsome extracts ^rom the despatch wh^ch had been received fromthe British Ambassador at Washington, and reformed especially to a paragraph in which Sir Auckland Go hies expressed theopinion that the renewal of the Alliance would have a soberingeffect on the extremists who were always calling for addition-al armaments.The Lord President of the Council, interposing, said thatin giving this view Sir Auckland Gedd.es apparently contemplateed the Americans- at any rate assuming that Great Britain would support Japan in a war with the United States, which wasexactly what we wanted to make quite clear to them we worenot prepared to do.In conclusion, with regard to the policy which he was disposed&apos; to recommend, the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs said that the natural-inclination, from the broadpoint of view, was to ask &quot;Why should there not be a tripart-Ite Agreement between Great Britain, America and Japan?&quot;    Thedifficulty about making any arrangement of that kind would bethat the anti-British party in America rould probably nettolerate any- such Agreement, and, even though it were to beagreed to by the House of Representatives, it would fail inthe Senate.    Further, there could be no guarantee of Americanstability.    The second alternative which he (Lord Cur&amp;on) was inclined to favour, and which he thought everyone but the canadians would accept6 was to admit at once that the present agreement was not suitable and required modification, and,while proposing Its renewal in a revised form to Japan, to claim the right to consult the other parties interested.,    his advice would therefore be that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould take this line at the Imperial Cabinet, and suggestthat Japan should be approached quite frankly and informed
that in view of the Covenant of the League of Nations theTreaty could only he renewed in a fresh form, and at, thesame time -His Majesty&apos;s Government would like, in the firstinstance, to discuss the question with the Governments ofthe United States of America and China,  in order to remove the objections of those countries.    He  (Lord Curzon) wouldbe inclined not only to have a new Agreement better suited tothe existing situation, but also one for a shorter ten: ofyears, viz., four or five years.    An Agreement might be wadewith America at the same time,&apos;to terminate concurrently withthat with Japan.    Those would be the lines on which he (hordCurzon) would be inclined to proceed,  but though it might bepossible to provide for the participation of the United states at a later date should they so desire, he would not proposetheir inclusion now, since the policy of the American Goverh-ment was so apt to change abruptly with the changes in theAdministration.    The suggested negotiations would take sometime,  and he thought the Alliance should,  in the meantime, be renewed for at least six months.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said he did notthink the attitude of the Dominion Governments was exactlyas stated by the Secretary of Soaoe for Foreign Affairs.Canada was undoubtedly,  as stated by Lord Curzon, againstthe renewal of the Alliance, and the Canadian Prime minister had proposed a Conference of the Pacific Powers, and alsothat Sir Robert Borden should be sent to Washington to die-cuss the matter.    The Canadian Government had even gone sofar as to suggest their making an independent arrangement if his Majesty&apos;s Government decided to renew the Alliance.    He(Mr Churchill) thought that it was not inclination which had made Mr Hughes and Mr Massey advocate the renewal of the alliance, but really they were actuated by fear of japan and alarmed at the rapid growth of the Japanese Navy.   Anyhcthe fact of their taking up the attitude they dim made theposition easier, as it would have been a very serious step
for His Majesty*s Bfi-^^TJi^it^J^ypf^e-^-^Ae the views of. the^s^Amr^ii^Mijnl&amp;tvz-s had they all been-against the renewal of the Treaty.    Re (Mr Churchill) thought that if the matter was handled.tactfully it would be possible to get everyoneto agree.   The difference between the proposals made by LordOurzon and the line of policy advocated by Mr Hughes was notvery great.    Moreover, he hoped it would be found that therewas not any great difference of opinion with the Canadianrepresentatives over the proposals made by the Secse secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.   What Canada wanted to do bysummoning a Conference was to ensure the peace of the Pacific.and the only difference was that she suggested attaining thisgoal in a somewhat different way from that just proposed.-Ke-hmr&apos; ^HiurchiJLl)-- hoped, personally that- .tlie-general ^questionof a Conference of Pacific Powers would not be put aside, anohe thought that the Treaty might be renewed for a short termin the meantime.    The main-differenee-of opinion betweenAmerioa jand.^Japan-aroae out of the situation in China andthe different ambitions of the two countries&apos; and,again,there was the question-o-f Japanese &quot;immigration on the pacific Coast.    It would, indeed, be an enormous advantage i&apos;-anything could be done to get the United States and Japan tocome to some-agreement.    His Majesty&apos;s Government had decide to maintain a one-Power naval---standard.,..-and an -adherence-&quot;tothis policy was going to be very expensive if America and japan continued a competition in naval armaments.    UnitedStates Naval Officers would naturally go to their ministers and say that England was Japan&apos;s ally, and that the positiorwas very dangerous unless the United States built againstjboth countries.    In that case a very dangerous situation would be created-^ and there would be a constant feeling ofantagonism by which foreign politics could not help being; affected.    It would be a ghastly state of affairs if we .\ were to drift into direct naval rivalry with the United\States, and he did not think that His Majesty&apos;s Government-11-
-should rest so long,.as&quot;&apos;there-was any chance of avoiding it.On the -ether-hand, he did not know what the United StatesGovernment would say.    He would like, at the Imperial Cabinet,to explain to the Prime. Ministers the importance to us ofrenewing the Alliance, and at the same time tell them thatHis Majesty*a- Government was in favotir of holding a Confer-ence, and that, failing this, it wa3 their view that theAgreement should be renewed in a modified form, negotiations at the same time being carried out with the United StatesGovernment in order to-, explain to them that the agreement was not in any way directed-against American interests.The Prlro^-Minister- asked if,  in the event of a Conferencebeing held,  it would be possible to leave out France, andwhether she would be satisfied if she was not invited totake part?The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theinterests of France in the Pacific were small, bat that itmight be well to include her.    If the--ques ticn cf China was discussed, of course France-co-v&apos;&apos;d rot be kept out.The Lord JPrivy-,Seal said that the. raising of this question had reminded him cf another point*    It seemed to him thatjthere would be a great difference between Hie Majesoy&apos;si--Go-vernmeni summoning the Conference and the President ofthe Unitedv-States doing so.    Ee thought it would have avery good effect if we could get the President to do it.The Lord President of the Council said he thought that lord Curaon&apos;S arguments were very convincing.    He personallywould be inclined to suggest combining Lord Curzon&apos;s and MrChurchillfs proposals, as he did not see why we should notfrankly tell tlie Japanese and Americans that we thought thereshould be a general agreement.    Altho\igh the situation inthe Pacific was being continually referred to, he thoughtthat the import-ant question concerned China, and the momenti&apos;one commenced to criseuss the commercial interests cf theEuropean Powers in that part of the world, difficulties
v^^no^^x-oeoou^^urtherr he did not think that in any dis-eussion it would be possible to leave out South America, andhe would like to ask his colleagues to think what the ChilianGovernment would say if they were told that a Conferonce,at which they were not represented,, was considering the ques-tion of the Pacific?    He (Fa- Balfour) was in. favour of the renewal of the Alliance, but it should only be for a shortterm, and at the same time His Majesty&apos;o Government should say that they wished to have a Conference about the Pacific,At different times he had talked a good deal to Bo.YdGrey about the question, and the latter had always taken theview that His Majesty7 s Government must be vex*y careful as to how far they tried to keep Japan out of China.  It had to beremembered that the Japanese were not allowed to go toAustralia or to New Zealand, or to California or to the philippines., or, in fact, to any place wl -re there was a white population.    It was, therefore9 somewhat unreasonable to say she was not&apos; to- expand in a country where there was ayellow race.The Lord -Privy Seal.. cold that, apart from all other con-eiderations, he thought the most important point waa to pre-vent Japan drifting into a Rueao-German combination.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that, in his view, the situation in China was at the root of all the trouble.The First Lord of the Admiralty erld he did not wish to g)in detail into the disadvantages and advantages of renewingthe Alliance, and he proposed to leal with the matter more from the political than from the strate, do point of view,.He was strongly influenced by the belief that the political relations of this country and America were of transcendentimportance and outvrerghed in every way those with other-Powers or any combination of powers.   The trouble was thatthe ordinary American, never saw beyond the confine3 of hisown State..    There was a feeling in America of intense
hostility to Japan, and a dislike of our Alliance with thatcountry.    In case he might have been out-of-date in theviews he took, he (Lord Lee) had recently taken the oppor-.tunity of discussing with Admiral Sims the rivalry between us and America, without, of course, making any direct refer-ence to the discussions which were taking place in conneo.-tion with the renewal of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance.    TheAmerican Admiral had told Mm that the American people werevehemently opposed to the Alliance,, and that so long as itexisted it would be very difficult to get reasonable people in the United States to curb the cry for additional arms.He had pointed out that there was no use in telling an american in the Middle West that Article IV of the Allianceprovided for Great Britain being under no obligation to goto war in support of Japan against America.    Such peoplethought Inevitably that British sympathies in some form orother would be on the other side in such a conflict.    Theextent to which America ecuId build ships was unlimited. she could not only build against Japan, but also against GreatBritain and Japan combined.    Japan, was already spending merethan half of her revenue on her Navy and Array, and there was evidence that she could not continue doing so.    He (lord Lee)did not&quot;agree with the view taken by Sir Auckland Geddes,and he thought that the American people would say,  &quot;Mahan haeshown us why the British Empire grew to be such a Power inthe world, and we intend to be the Great Power in the future&apos;He was inclined to agree with tho views expressed by mr churchill.    If anyone talked of the Alliance in Americaeveryone was at once on their hind legs.    He would suggestAmerica being prevailed upon to summon a Conference toconsider the application of some form of Monxoe DoStrineto the Pacific,    If this were done,  Japan wo ill   find it very difficult to stay out.    In any case,  it would be worthtrying, but whatever happened we could not afford to risk a difference of opinion within the Empire.
&apos;Tl^^eeretary^f&apos;&apos;&quot;Startsfor. India- said that Japan was rota very popular country with the Government of India, and he explained the action of the Japanese in India daring recentyears, where they had not only come into competition with theBritish in acquiring property, out had also been closely con-nected with sedition-mongers-,,   He thought, however, that itwould, be extremely unfortunate if the Alliance were to cometo an end, or if anything were to be done which would makeJapan an unfriendly Power.    Prom the point of view of India,the Alliance constituted a wedge in the policy of &quot;Asia forthe Asiatics*,    He agreed with Mr Chamberlain that it would be disastrous to force Japan into a Rueso.....German combination.    Ifthe Alliance was renewed in a modified form he would ash thatall reference to India should be omitted from the preamble.He thought that the inclusion of references to India in theAgreements of the past had given the Japanese an excuse forpenetration in India and for trying to find, out what was going on.    It was an extraordins.ry thing that    menevar there hadbeen trouble on the lrtdp--0hin.eee frontier in recent years there had at once been an 1nflux of Japanese into the dieturb-ed area.    The Japanese Alliance was not popular in India,  asthe Indian people  thought it meant that in certain circum-stances Japanese might be brought there to help the British,Such a possibility was, to him, inconceivable.    He would liketo suggest that, as one of the conditions of renewal of theTreaty, Japan should formally disinterest herself in Tibetand those provinces of China which border on India,    His view was that the Agreement should be renewed in a modified formand that His Majesty&apos;s Government ohouTd support the holding of a Conference of the Pacific Powers,   but it was important that it should be made quite clear that the holding of an.oh aConference was not proposed as being contrary to  the interestsof Japan.The Secretary of State for Po.rei.gn Affairs emid that Itwould take some time to arrange for a Conference, and somethirr
wwaid *im[w. pJibQ in vhn mmtoiim. j4v,* *mnr uwas neoees-ary- to -assume-that-the holding of a conference would be in eon flic t with a renewal of the Agreement.Dr Addison asked if it was suggested that the Ag re ere antshould be renewed before a Conference was actually held?The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs answered in the affirmative.The Minister of Health asked if there uould not be some danger in Japan taking advantage of a renewal 0f the Agroo)tientfor four years to intensify the efforts to increase her Navy?The Prime Minister thought that if the Alliance were notrenewed the Japanese would naturally aay that Great Britain had dropped them..    It would excite bit-cor feeling in Japan, whereBritishers might come to be regarded- oven more bitterly thanthe Americans were now.    The people would sty that His MajostysGovernment had been frightened of America and it would cortain-ly have an unfavourable effect on our prestige in the Far East,if not throughout the whole world     rTo (Mr Lloyd George) thouchlthat the arguments of the Secretrry of State for ForeignAffairs were irresistible, and ho personally had for some time-past thought a German-Russo- combination a future possibility.When the time came that there was a regenerated Russia, therewould be Poland and France working in close co-operation, andthe most natural thing was for Germany to look for an ally inRussia.    After the war of 1870 France had had to give in time after time when bullied by Germany;    then Russia came on the scene, and&apos; Germany had to be more cautious,    Germany would nowplay the role which France played subsequently to 1871.   Witha regenerated Russia and Germany backing her up. and a Japanbitterly hurt because of our breaking off our friendh ip, themost natural thing would be for Japan to become an easy preyto Russo-Gerroan advances.    In such circumstances the friend-ship of France would not be sufficient support for GreatBritain.    He (Mr Lloyd George) sincerely hoped, therefore,that no-one would contemplate dropping Japan,, and he really
3 i 3-did...nohose why^re^hould do so..    Japan, on the whole, hadb*en faithful to her obligations.    No doubt she had carriedout one or two suspicious transactions, but he could tell the Cabinet of several things done by other Powors whichwere infinitely worse than anything which had been done bythe Japanese.    Reference had been made to Japanese intriguesin India, but he would like to know what would happen if wewere now to drop Japan?    The situation would bo very much worse.    Frankly, he  (Mr Lloyd George) liked the Japanese.The reasons  they gave very often for doing things were quiteunintelligible, and they might have no conscience, but thoydid stand by those who stood by them, and they had givenunfailing support to their Allies at the International Con-ferences.    Re (Mr Lloyd George) was in favour of arranginga Pacific Conference,  if possible, but only after His majesty government had said to the Japanese that we would not drop the Cabinet agreed  (a) At the forthcoming meeting with the represent-atives of the Dominions and India,  to supportthe proposal that the President of the UnitedStates of America should be ashed to summon aConference of the Pacific Powers, but only after it had been made quite clear to japan and to the other Powers concerned that wehad no intention of dropping the Alliance:(b) That the period of the renewed Alliance shouldbe shorter than the previous term of ten years,and that its terms should be so drawn as notto be inconsistent with the Covenant of theLeague of Nations, or liable to offend Americansusceptibilities.   With the latter object inview, conversations precedent tc the renewal of the Alliance should be entered into withthe United States of America and China.    Ifthe policy was accepted by the Dominions andIndia, Japan should be fully informed:(c) &quot;In order to givo time for the above procedure,the Alliance should be renewed provisionallyfor such further periods of three months as might prove necessary:(d) To invite the Admiralty and the War Officeto prepare Papers showing the assistance givenby Japan in the late War in the Naval opera-tions and in the supply of armaments to Russiarespectively, and to ask the Committee ofImperial Defence to prepare, before the meetingof the Imperial Cabinet, a Paper on the strategicsituation in the Par Bast in tha event of thoAnglo-Japanese Alliance being determined.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, ....May 30, 1921. -17-
