[r AWLO- (1) -r-?ith reference to Cabinet 14 (21), Conclusion 18,/P/f.wSB &apos;ALLIANCE.       and Appendix I (4), the question of the Anglo-Japanese Alli-ance was referred to as a matter of urgency, owing to thenecessity of sending some reply to a personal telegram,dated April 1st, addressed to the Prime Minister by thePrime Minister of Canada.^e Cabinet were unanimous that th^ question could notbe discussed in the absence of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, who was indisposed, and, in view of theforthcoming Conference at Lympne,  there appeared to be no reasonable prospect of discussing the subject    this week.The Cabinet agreed ^That the Secret?ry of State for the Coloniessho^ald send an interi   private r^ply to thePri;.e Vinister of the Dominion of Canadaexplaining that,  owing to the intensepressure of business due to the industrialcrisis, the Cabinet had not yet been ableto consider the question,  and that, owingto the indisposition of tile Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs, a fa   days&apos;further delay in sending a reply wasunavoidable.
(S) ,,?ith reference to Cabinet 22 (21), Conclusion 5 and appendix XI, the attention of the Cabinet was called, as amatter of urgency, to a question to be asked that afternoon in the House of Commons, by Mr V.alter. Guinness, as to whether,in view of representations from the South of Ireland, it wasnot desirable to postpone the date for the elections in southern Ireland,,The Cabinet were informed that if an indefinite replywere made there would probably be a Motion for the Adjourn-ment.A proposal was considered that the discussion by theCabinet on Irish lolicy, arranged ^or that afternoon, shouldbe taken that morning, and the discussion on ths Budget be postponed until the afternoon.    This arrangement, however, was found inconvenient to several members and was not adopted.It was pointed out that, even if the adjournment of theHouse was moved, there would be time for full considerationby the Cabin-t before the debate.^ha question v*as considered as to whether it r ightnot be advantageous to encourage a debate on a Motion forthe Adjournment, in ord^r to allow th--- House of Commons toput pressure on the Government for a postponement.After an adjournment of this question,  to enablethe Chief Secretary for Ireland to be present, the PrimeMinister undertook to see Mr .valter Guinness at the Houseof Commons, before questions,  and,  if necessary, to agreeto a discussion on a kotion for the Adjournment.Consideration of the pplicy of the Government was adjourned until the afternoon Meeting of the Cabinet.

Mond,Lord Crawford,Cmdr. Hilton Yoxmg,Mr P.
