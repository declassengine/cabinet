&apos;3 MIDDLE EAST.  (2) Tlae^CabiJiek-l^ for tlv,,aLePOineia&apos;    ColoniJ3S a stat^ent of policy in the Middle East, in antici-irabia,  etc.    pation of his forthcoming statement in Parliament... Mr Churchilltandates. described the rapid progress made with the reduction of thegarrison in accordance with the programme approved by theCabinet  (Cabinet 14  (21), Conclusion 5),  and gave an indie a-tion of the further steps which would be carried out in exe-cution of that programme, provided nothing happened to cause a hitch.    He then gave an. account of the measures taken inthe formation of ah Arab Government in Mesopotamia, and ofthe prominent personalities in the Ministries.    The candidates for the position of ruler of Mesopotamia were, he said, the emir Peisal, the Naqib and the Sheikh of Mohammerah (a Persian^of whom the first appeared to be the strongest candidate.The position in regard to Ibn Saud, whose subsidy had been increased, was fairly satisfactory.    Broadly speaking, mr churchill was able to give a satisfactory account of thedevelopment of the Government&apos;s policy in Mesopotamia.In regard to Palestine, the Secretary of State for theColonies indicated a somewhat less satisfactory position, owirrto the pronounced suspicions of Zionism among the local-inhab-titants.In Trano-Jordania, by summoning the Emir Abdulla tomeet him at Jerusalem, Mr Churchill had, he was informed,frustrated by only 48 hours the probability of serious action by him and his adherents against the French.    Abdulla had proved amenable to reason, and up to the present had keptfaith, though the understanding reached had only been on a six-months basis.    No complaints were being received from the. French, and there seemed a probability either that Abdullawould remain in Trans-Jordania or at least that an efficientsubstitute might be found.    Trans-Jordania, Mr Churchillinformed the Cabinet, was at present not under the palestine government, but directly under the High Commissioner.-2-
The Secretary of State for the Colonies paid a hightribute to the success af the Zionist colonies of long :.tand-Ing, which had created a standard of living far superior tothafc of the indigenous Arabs.    His observations had notconfirmed current accounts of the inferior quality of recentJewish inwlgranfcs, and by strict control  (proportionallyto the development of the country by water power,  etc.)  cfthe quality and number of the Zionists he lab pod to be able to fulfil cur undertaking,  though this woul. inevitably involvethe maintenance of a considerable garrison to ensure their protection.    The recent rioting and loss of life at Jaffaproved the need for this.    For the maintenance of order, astrong lecal gendarmerie was preferred to Zionist battalion?.The development of representative institutions inPalestine was at present suspended owing to the fact thatany elected body would Undoubb oily prohibit further irnrcigra-tion of Jews.The Cabinet were informed by one of their colleagues that, according to reliable information from a Zionist source,the French were indulging in a good deal of anti-british propaganda in Palestine, and that the Jaffa incidents had been due to this. -   -In regard to the allegation-, that insufficient Arabshad been included in the Palestine Administration, Mr C-hurchillstated that Sir Herbert Samuel, the High Commissioner, had given him a complete reply on every point.Finally, tho Secretary of State for the Coloniesstrongly urged that certain amendments to the draft Mandatesshould be pressed forward at the forthcoming meeting of theCouncil of the League of -Nations, and that the suggestionthat they should be held up owing, to the American, opposition should be strongly combated.
-Tiis. Cabinet  (a) Generally agreed with the view that the mandates should not he held tip, whichthey commended to the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs and the Minister ofEducation (who will be the british representative at the forthcoming meetingof the Council of the League) t) who, theCabinet were informed, were to meet inthe immediate future to examine the pro-posed alterations in the Mandates:(b) Thanked the Secretary of State for theColonies for his very interesting andi1luminating at a oernent0REACTION OH (3)  The Secretary of State for oho Colonies concluded hiESOPOTAMIAOF OUR statement by pointing out that the policy approved by thePOLICY INTURKEY, Cabinet was dependent on there being no Turkish aggression.He strongly pressed,  therefore,,  for a continuation of thediscussion begun at the morning Meeting in regard to our policy in Turkey, with a view to an early decision.TURKEY, (4) With reference bo Cabinet 44 (21), Conclusion 1, theThe Future Cabinet resumed for a short time their discussion on policyof Cons tan-tinople. in Turkey,The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the cuestion should be examined, inthe first&quot;instance, by a Cabinet committee composed of The Prime Minister,The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,The Secretary of State for the Colonies,The Secretary of State 4fer India,The Secretary of State for War,The Minister of Health,Sir Maurice Hankey (Secretary):(b) That the above Committee should meet on thefollowing day at 4-3Q p.ia, in the PrimeMinister&apos;s Room, House of Commons:(c) That the secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should take ouch steps as ho might deem advisable to ascertain the views ofM.&apos; Venizelos on the present position.

The Afghans Lad expressed the opinion that theywould prefer a Treaty with both,, but if that were impossibleand they had to choose,  they would prefer a Treaty with theBritish Empire to  a Treaty with  the Bolsheviks,2, Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.1,May SI,  1021.
