M, St. Aulairehad told him that the French Government had watched our industrial crisis with a good deal of anxiety, and he hadtransmitted messages of congratulation to the Prime Ministerfro51&quot; the President o^ the Republic, M. Mi lie-rand, as well asfrom M. &quot;r^and.    In a further message communicated by theFrench Ambassador, M, Briand had asked, not for a formalConference, but for a personal meeting -&apos;ith the Prime Ministerwhich would probably take place at Folkestone or Boulogne at&apos;the end of the present week
The^afrterrtion-of the Cabinet was called to the answer&quot;given by the Prime Minister to a Question put in theHouse of Commons on the previous day, when he had pointedcut that the German Government were still in default onreparation, trials of persons accused of o^f^nces againstthe laws of war, and disarmament;    that they had so farshflwn ne inclination to put forward practical proposals forcarrying out the Treaty of Versailles in these respects;    andthat in these circxrmstances it was imperative that the Alliesshsuld confer as to the further steps which may be necessaryto enforce compliance with the conditions of the Treaty,The Prime Minister infarmed his colleagues that hehad purposely stiffened up this answer in view of information that the Gem-an Government was to hold a meeting today toconsider what course they should adept.The information before ^Jae Cabinet was to the effectthat while the political situation in Germany was uncertain,the probability was that Dr Simons would remain in affise.The German Cabinet had not as yet apparently decided on whatproposals they would submit regarding reparation, and had beeiendeavouring to persuade^z&amp;tii^S^st&amp;ia^ Switiierla-vi and theUnited States of America to mediate sn their behalf.    In these efforts they had&apos;&apos;been unsuccessful, but the probability wasthat before May 1st. proposals would be submitted by theGerman Government,    There was na reason to suppose that the&apos;suggestions which had-appeared in the Press, as,  for example,that America should take over Germany&apos;s reparation indsbted-nesa, had any -foundation, in fact.    As regards Prance,  theFrench Government on the present occasion were apparentlydetermined to take drastic action, involving probably theoccupation of the Ruhr and certain neighbouring portions ofWestphalia.    This would not merely be a military f-coumciicn,but an effective taking over of the administrative andfinancial control of the occupied territories and the erection of a Customs barrier on their Eastern frontier.    The Ruhr coal
would then he -9-oJLd^.tcrpr1.ce pins a Customs Duty of 40 gold francs a ton.pation in any such scherre would necessitate the use of troops and the employment of a large&apos; number of Customs officials totake the place of the German officials, who would doubtlesscease to function.    Secondly, there was a proposal, which hadnot as yet been officially put forward,  that the Allies should occupy Hamburg and Bremen and s^ize the Customs at thoseplaces,    ^he French Government probably intended to employboth methods, with a view to forcing Germany to complete and rapid surrender0    The French were, it &apos;to put their plan intooperation.    The control of the Ruhr coal supplies and theCustoms harrier-&quot;would, enable,&quot;could be devoted to reparation.    In what form payment Vas tobe made had not, however,  transpired.The Belgian Government were averse .from tha^-e^-dras-td^steps;    the Italian Government were still more strongly opposed, and had suggested that if a new and genuine offer was received from the Germans it should be referred for con-si deration, in the first instance, to a Conference of Expertssimilar to that which had met at Brussels. The JapaneseGovernment would, no doubt, support any action which theBritish Government might propose to take.It was pointed out that the Italian proposal would bevehemently cont^st^d by the French,    M, Briand1s attitude had undergone a change, and he was now prepared to take military action alone, provided he was assured of the moral support of the other Allies.    France would also resent any interference by the United States of America.    The. failure- ofM. Viviani&apos;s Mission and the reply given by the AmericanGovernment to Dr Simonsf request for intervention made any active interference by America unlikely.The Cabinet were informed that there was little prospect of the French Government agreeing to any further
-^^slay-^^nd that the re^lr-diiflUculty^aa net bo much theinabiJLjHTy^o-f^HS^^ as the reluctance of her weakGovernment to enter into any commitments of a character which the Allies could accept,    It therefore became neces-sary to conaider--whethex. German public opinion should not be forced to decide between two unpleasant alternatives.Germany could probably pay something approximating to the paris figures, particularly after some laps^ of time andon the restoration of her economic and industrial prosperity.The British Government might offer to support Prance providedthat the latter gavo assurances that she was seek:&apos;.m.g repara-tion and not the permanent occupation of German &apos;. Mr?-!toryor the breaking up 01* Germany into sepai&quot;ate state,    Wrththis latter policy Great Svitain could have nothing to do.Farther, Prance must state that she was oeeking reparationand not the mere handling of cash.    Prance ought to be com-pelled, if necessary, to accept a genuine &quot;German...offer of reparation in kind,    This-^vould. help the French Budget diffieulty, which was really at the bottom of much of the anxietyin Franc e.Until recently the-,policy of France respecting the ruhr had been to eay that unless by a coroo-ir. date the GermaGovernment carried out their obligations the Ruhr would be occupied. The popular policy, and one which M. Briand wasbeing pressed to adopt, was to occupy the Ruhr without anynotice and to anter into negotiations with the German Government after the occupation had taken effect.As regards the purely financial aspect of the ques-tion, the Cabinet were reminded that on or before May 1stthe Reparation Commission must, under the provisions ofArticle 233 of the Treaty of Versailles, notify to theGerman Government its findings as to the amount of damagefor which compensation has to be paid by Germany, togetherwith a ochedule of payments prescribing the time and manneifor securing and discharging the entire obligation within
a period., of thirty years- from fey 1,  1921.    there appeared to be s&apos;om* reason to/ anticipate that the extent of the German Government&apos;&apos;s obligationmight be completed by the Reparation commission at a figure between 135 and 150 milliards of gold marks.In addition, under Article 235 of the Treaty ofVersailles,  in order to enable the Allied and associated powers to proceed at once to the restoration of theirindustrial and economic life pending the full determination of their claims, Germany is due to pay, in such instalmentsand in such manner a3 the Reparation Con miss ion may fix by may 1, 1921, the equivalent of 20 milliards of gold marks,Germany at first claimed to have paid more than this sura,,but has now receded from that position, and her actuclpayments are estimated by the Reparation Commission at only8 milliards o^ gold marks,  leaving her in default to theextent of 12 milliards of gold marks.Considerable misgiving was expressed in regard tothe French proposals.    It w;,s pointed out that the oceupa-tion of the Ruhr, and more particularly of Hamburg and Bremenwould involve the Allies in the greatest difficulties notonly in Germany itself but also at home.    The occupationof the Ruhr might result in serious rioting, and in any casethe German miners would probably decline to produce thepresent coal output.    Trouble with the German miners mighthave very serious repercussions in Great Britain.It was also urg^d that the present position asregards Upper Silesia gave the German Government a goodexcuse for asking for delay, and it was suggested that thebest line to adopt would be to put pressure on the FrenchGovernment to retard decisive action and endeavour to persuade them to disillusion       French public opinion as tothe amount which it was possible to recover from Germany byway of reparation.
On^th^^thm^^Tmnd it was pointed out that the threat of th.! ^ ^occupation of the Ruhr-was prohahly the only effective method leftto Prance of forcing the German Government into a reasonable a tti-tude, and that it would not be easy to refuse to concur in theFrench proposals unless we had some alternative means to suggestof putting pressure on germany    In this connection reference wasmade to the possibility of giving France a guarantee of her futuresecurity, such as the abortive Joint Anglo-American guaranteegiven at the Peace Conference, and also the possibility of usingFrance&apos;s indebtedness to Great Britain as a factor in gettingFrance to abate her claims against Germany.In connection with the supply by Germany of materials, etc.,for the restoration o^ the devastated areas in France, reference was made to the Memoranda by Mr Amery and Sir Alfred. Mend(Paper CP.-2720) (Paper C.F.--2722), which advocated the partialsatisfaction of Germany&apos;s reparation indebtedness to the BritishEmpire by the supply of materials for the construction of neces-sary works which could only be undertaken in present circumstancesif the material was obtained gratuitously.The Prime Minister summed up the Conclusions of the meeting as to the policy -which he and his colleagues should pursue in theforthcoming Conference with M. Briand, in the following terms:-That British consent to the occupation of the ruhr, In the event of Germany not miking an offer of tbft Paris terms or their practicalequivalent before May 1st, should be depend-ent unon -(a) A clear undertaking that the occupationwill be temporary and will not lead tothe dismemberment of Germany or a per-manent occupation of German territory:(b) An acceptance of the Paris proposals asa maximum demand on Germany in respectof all reparation claims:(c) That the French Government should accept any genuine German offer to supply materials and manufactures to the utirost possible extent for the restoration of the devas-tated areas in France.It was also agreed -r*That the Admiralty should report to theCabinet as to the feasibility of the pro-posed Naval occupation of Hamburg and Bremen,and as to the extent to which military co-operation in 3uch occupation wo\ild be necessary
I^RICAH (6) The Cabinet were informed of a proposal made by anfcjVTUARY[OR TTY- American Society to provide a group of statuary commemorativeiUTH.of the sailing of the Pilgrim Fathers at Plymouth, providedthat the Town Council would grant a site, that the BritishGovernment, would bear the cost of erection, and that the TownCouncil signified their intention, of providing a site.It was agreed  That the First Commissioner of works should be authorised to incur any neces- -sary expenditure in the erection of the memorial in question.&quot;DAILY (7) With reference to Cabinet 23 (21), Conclusion 13,Ln AND.h&quot;PS5 the attention of the Cabinet was drawn to the statement inSNSES.today&quot;s &quot;Daily Mail&quot; purporting to give the effect of thedecision reached by the Cabinet yesterday on the recommend-ations contained in the Report of the Select Committee on members&apos; Expensesethe Cabinet, took note of the fact thatwhile the account in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;was not strictly accurate, it cord d only have been based on confidential informa-tion.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,April 19, 1921.
