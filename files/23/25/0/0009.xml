Liqpm^(Xfflmoix*. (3) With reference to Cabinet 14 (21), Conclusion 4,and.Cabinet 16 (21), Conclusion 2, the Cabinet discussed the o^cti^ri--^^rXixtu^^ (An early decision was recognised to be necessaryin view of the introduction, arranged for Friday, April22nd, of Colonel Oretton&apos;s Private Licensing Bill.The President of the Board of Education, as Chairmanof the Cabinet Committee, made a statement indicating theCommittee&apos;a views on the main questions at issue.    The Com-mittee were in favour of sanctioning the immediate publicationof the Order relaxing restrictions, which the Central Control^oard had submitted to the Cabinet some weeks ago (paper cp.-2645), and of extending the   relaxations proposed inthe Order,   The Committee had also considered the generalscope of a Bill which should give permanent statutory forceall o^er the country to ouch restrictions as the government thought fit to retain.    They had come to the conclusion thatthe&apos;&apos;/constitution of any new Licensing Authority would be strongly opposed in the House of Commons, and that the ad-ministration of the restrictions should be left to the licensing Justices.    They were further agreed that any restrictions applicable to public-houses must be applied to.Clubs, and that in areas where the Sunday Closing Order isin ^orce Clubs should be.permitted to supply drink duringthe ordinary Sunday drinking hours in force in England.    The/were agreed that the hours during which public-hoxises shouldhe open should be fixed by the clock as at present, and thatthe /Justices in Petty Sessions should have discretion to makeexceptions within certain limits to meet local conditions.The&apos; Committee also support-d the continuance of the prohibitic&apos;pf credit sales, despite the opposition which would be putforward by wine merchants and their customers.    If suchopposition were v-ry strongly pressed it would be open tothe Government to make an exception in favour of the consumersof wine.    The Committee were in some doubt as to the
tempera rice value/ of the Regulations with respect to   the dilution of spiritsand beer.    The Committee^&apos; recommendation with regard to colonel Cretton&apos;s Bill was that the Government Whips shouldbe taken off during the Seoond Reading and the Governmentshould acquiesce in its being sent to a Standing Committee,but should state that they proposed to introduce a Bill oftheir own and could not undertake to give Parliamentary timefor a Private Bill cn the subject.    In Mr Fisher?s view theBill was far too ambitious to pass this Session, but it con-..tained some Clauses which could usefully be embodied in aGovernment measu.re.    Its Clauses dealing with LicensingAppeal Courts and the transfer of licences would be certain to meet with strong opposition.The Cabinet discussed at length the statement made bythe President of the Board of Fducation, with special refer-ence to the programme of legislation to which the Governmentwere already committed for this  Session.    One suggestion wasthat Colonel Gretton&apos;s Bill should be allowed to go upstairsto a Committee, where all views would be represented and thepossibility could be explored-of obtaining an agreed Bill.It was pointed out, however, that certain parts of the Bill(Articles 9 and 1?) could not be proceeded with without a financial resolution.    Moreover,  there was the risk that theGovernment might become saddled with the Bill, for the passageof which there was almost certainly not time this Session.In any1 event, experience had shown that the Committee would at the Committeeinsist on a Minister being present/In order to give the viewsof the Government on every Clause.   On the whole, therefore,this course did not command itself to the Cabinet, althoughavailable,it was recognised that there was no means/which the Governmentwould be willing to take, for preventing the Bill from being sent to a Committee if the House of Commons so desired.
General., agreement was expressed with the view that thepermanent liquor policy of the Government should aim at an improved type of public-house, with inducements to meet theabuses which now prevail, such inducements to include notonly more attractive premises but more wholesome beverages;that the trade should have a right of appeal beyond the localMagistrates&apos; Bench, and that there should be some more centralauthority, free from political pressure, for surveying andco-ordinating the liquor policy of the country as a whole.The view also found support that it would be desirableto allow the people of -Vales to deal with the problem intheir own v:ay&amp;Mtention was drawn to the representations made bythe Board of Customs and Bxcise and the Pood Controllerregarding the retention of the control of b-er and spiritsprices, and the advantage which would accrue to the. revenueby the removal of such control (Papers CP,-2527 and CP,-2624),   The present restrictions on gravity, it was pointedout, give an unfair preference to Irish as compared withEnglish brevers.    On the other hand, stress was laid on thesocial advantages which had followed during the War as a resul1of the growing habit of drinking light rather than heavybsere,After a full discussion of the various courses open,the Cabinet agreed --(a) To concur in the action of the Lord privy seal in informing Colonel Gretton that th**Government could give no facilities for thepassage of the Bills(b) That in regard to Colonel Gretton&apos;s bill the Attorney-General should make a state-ment, in the course of which he shouldcomment favourably upon certain portionsand criticise- othor portions, includingmore particularly those suggesting theemployment of Judges for purposes ofappeal.    He should endeavour to avoid
making a statement of Government policy,but should blocks an appeal to reasonablemen on both side3 of the question toget together with a view to an agreed policy.    He should add that the Poverr.-*Kent recognised that the question of liquor Control was one which they wouldhave to take up at an early date:    that,for reasons with which Pavliat ent wasfamiliar, it was impossible to deal with it comprehensively during the present session, and that no-one ought to advance this pro--posal who was not also prepared to advocatean Autumn Session:    that any legislationintend^ to solve narts o^ the liquorproblem rust be unsatisfactory, and thatin the meanwhile the Government proposedby administrative action to make certainrelaxations:(c) That the Prime Minister should appeal tothe Liquor Control Toard to continue toremain in office for another year:(d) That, as the Cabinet Committee wished togo further than the Liquor Control Board,arrangements should be made with the liquor control Board as to the exact relaxationsto be made.(NQTK.    The Prime Minister arranged withthe Atto mey-Genaral to do his best to see the Liquor ControlBo^dri l^f^fi ^Friday in regard to(e) To adjourn the question of retaining controlOf gravity and prices of h-er, and to reject the nroposal    to relax the period for theTelenet of spirits, contained in theImmature Spirits Act.-5-
Cabinet 59 (20), Appendix V (1),the,Cabinet had before them the following documents inregard to the use of Native Troops in Mandated Territories:-A Memorandum by the General Staff, datedDecember 22, 1920, circulated with theauthority of the Secretary of State forWar (Paper C,P.-2361):A Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Yte,r,  fated March 18, 1321, covering a Memorandum by the General Staff (PaperO.P.&apos;-273i) :A -Memorandum by the President of theBoard of Education (Paper C .P.-2806),Briefly stated,  the contention of the General staff is that from a military point of view the British are placed at a disadvantage as compared with the French by the terms oftheir respective drafts for the &quot;B&quot; Mandates.Article 4 of the British draft, which is based on article 22 of the Covenant, provides that the Mandatoryshall not organise any native military force in the terri-tory except for local police purposes and for th0- defenceof the territory.The corresponding Article of the French WB&quot; Mandate,which is based on an understanding reached at the PeaceConference in January, 1919, provides specifically that troops raised in case of a general war can be utilised to resist an aggression or for the defence of territory outsidef,he region fiovfl^d by the Mandate.In short, the French Mandate enables them to usetroops raised in the mandated territory outside, that terri-tory in the event of a general war, and the British Mandatedoes not.The Cabinet were informed of the course of the nego-tiationa which had taken place in Paris, which had resultedin the Mandates assuming their present form, and it waspointed out that, in view of the absence from membership of the League of Nations of the United States ari etherimportant countries, an early revision of tlv Covenantmight be found necessary.
The Cabinet agreed - -That, at the present time, it was undesir-able to attempt an amendment of the &quot;B&quot;Mandates in the direction desired by theWar Office, but, in the event of anyextensive revision of the Covenant, areconsideration of the question shouldnot be ruled out.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,April 20, 1921.
