irrm^IUVJA,      (I) mt^ef^r^^(X^^t 37 (Si), Conclusion 1,4, the-CaW.net had before them the following-documents relatingto the situation in Upper Silesia:-The Report of the Upper Silesia Commission (Paper CP.-2903),A Memorandum from M. Briand to Mr LlovdGeorge (Paper C.PJ-2946), yA Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs (Paper CP,-2947),A Memorandum by the Foreign Office(Paper CP.-2955),An Aide M6moi      han-ded by the british ambassador in Paris  (Lord Hardinge) toM. Briand on May 13, 1921 (Paper Ci:.-29 55).The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to the allegation-tions constantly made in the French Press to the effect thatthe British Government had failed to support the representa-determination  of the-. French Government at Berlin urging the GermanGovernment to restrain thmir nationals fro&quot;.&apos; provocative actionin Upper Silesia.    The Cabinet were informed that in fact theBritish Government had made more representations in UpperSilesia, in Berlin and through the German Ambassador inLondon than any other Government,  and that these representa-tions had in fact proved more effective than any others.    TheCabinet were also informed that the Foreign Office weretelegrnohinp: to the British Representative on the UpperStiesten Commission ashing for full information as to theGerman military activities in Upper Silesia, and the local-ties from which the German irregular forces there had been recruited.    The Foreign Office were also telegraphing to theBritish Ambassador in Berlin to send a selected officer to eastern Prussia to ascertain the position there.In view of the fact than Y:. Briand was to make astatement today in the French Chamber of Deputies, theCabinet agreed  That th- For-ign Office should telephone to paris for &quot;i. Briand&apos;s information, a state--ment of the facts regarding British repre-sentations at Berlin urging the GermanGovernment to restrain their nationalsfro-- provocative action in Upper Silesxa.
um]E^-ILf]SXA.      (2) In- the.....cxmrs-e. of the preceding discussion the cues-Despatch of   tlon -was raised as to whether the Britishgovernment souIdForces^ to.     not increase the force of four Battalions which, in accord--The Ir^ustrtr^nc-c-with a provisional decision taken by the Prime MinisterSituation at(Home, during the previous week, had been placed under orders toIreland   proceed to Upper Silesia from the Rhine.1&apos;troops for.The Secretary of State for War (who was accompaniedby the Chief of the Imperial General Staff during this dis-cussion), while recognising that there might be over-ridingpolitical considerations, entered a strong caveat, as to themilitary risks involved in the despatch of British troops toUpper Silesia.    These risks fell under two heads.    First,there was the danger of employing British troops in UpperSilesia itself to carry out a policy of maintaining orderwith which&apos; the French were not in sympathy, where they wouldbe operating under the general direction of a French Commands:hiswho declined to employ /own troops in furtherance of thistroopspolicy,    where in all probability our/would be supportedonl- by German forces in enforcing that policy, and with the grave risk that they might thereby become involved in acollision with French troops.    Second, there was th   risk ofdenuding the United Kingdom of troops at a time when theprotraction of the industrial situation would probably rendernecessary the early disbandment of the reserves recentlycalled out, while the situation in Ireland would call for thedespatch of reinforcements to that Island   subjects which sir Laming Worthingfon rvans indicated his intention of rais-ing at an early date.  .The Cabinet then discussed the possibility of sen! in;-to&apos;Upper Silesia Irish troops, which, in existing conditions,were not suitable for service in the United Kingdom.After hearing from the Secretary of State for ForeigiA-^airs the political aspects of the cyuestlbn, and after considering the military,resources available at home to dealwith the internal situation., which, it van generally agreed,
was daily becoming less menacing from the point of view ofpublic order,  the Cabinet agreed  (a) To confirc the provisional decisionof the Prime Minister to  *nnd. fourBattalions o^ ^ritifOb troon?&apos; to UpperCilenia?(b) That the  ;ar Office should send two additional Battalion?,, which,  at their discretion, might be Irish Battalions:(c) That the *ar Office, by arrangement with the Foreign Office, if neces-sary,   should make arrangements for safeguarding the British forces in upper Silesia against the risks ofa collision with the French troops,whether by the definite allocation of a particular zone to the Britishtroops, by the selection of an officerof great experience, or otherwise:(d) That,  in view of the important anddelicate duties to be dischargedand the increased forces, to be em-ployed, the Secretary of State forWar should consider the desirabilityof seridinp an officer of higher rankthan hitherto to command the Britishtroooo in Upper Silesia.IRELAND. (?) During the disouso ion referred to in the precedingQuality of     Conclusion, the Secretary of State for War undertook toBritishTroops in,     enquire into a suggestion that the troops recenti;/ sent toIreland to compensate for the troops withdrawn at the begin-ning of the industrial crisis, consisted mainly of immaturesoldiers.-IK-(
folM^FRESCH (4) With reference to Cabinet 38 (SC.). Conclusion 1the consideration of the Upper Sileaian question, referreddeposedMilitaryjuaranteato france to in Conclusion 3 above, extended to a preliminary discu3-sion of Anglo-French relations which, it was generally recognised with the utmost regret, had lately deteriorated-to a serious extent,    During this discussion the suggestion was made that our relations with Frane^ could best beestablished on -a permanently satisfactory footing by giving a guarantee to France on the lines of the joint Anglo-AmericaiGuarantee, which was signed at Paris during the Peace confer-ence but was rendered inoperative owing to the refusal of theUnited States of America to ratify it.    The text of this document, as well as the original proposal on which it was based, which was contained in a Memorandum dated March 85j1^19, circulated by the Prime Minister to the Council of four, was read to the Cabinet.The Secretary of State for the Colonies (Mr Churchill)stated that it was necessary to go further bach than thepresent controversy over Cpper Silesia in order to understand the attitude of the French.    The view of Marshal Foch, thatthe French must have the Rhine as a strategic frontier, hadbeen put forward at the time of the Armistice and had nevervaried.    To meet this we had advanced the proposal o^ a joint guarantee by the United States and ourselves that we would come to  the aid o* France in the case of an unprovoked attachon her by Germany* and the Treaty of Versailles had been modified as a result of this proposal;   but, owing to the refusal of the United States to ratify, the proposal for/ajoint guarantee had fallen through.   Consequently, the French,obsessed with fear for the future, were now basing theirpolicy on advancing into Germany, with the aid of a militariesPoland, before Germany could recover.    He would endeavour to allay that fear and restrain that aggressive action by giving-4-
the&quot;Trench. a.-written undertaking that we would come to heraid in the case of an unprovoked attack by Germany.    He would at the same time inform Germany of the conclusion of theAgreement with Prance, but would assure her of just&quot;and fairtreatment according to the Treaty of Versailles.    This would put the relations of the three countries on clear foundations.If, in spite of this,  there was still a rupture with Prance,we should have the support of our own people.   Mr Churchillthen referred to the Memorandum which had been circulated inJune, 1020, by the then Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr Cham-berlain)   (C.I.D. Paper ITo.246-B), and to the disadvantages weexperienced before the War when we were in fact bounS. inhonour to assist the French and yet had no formal and publicAgreement.    There was evidenc-% Mr Churchill proceeded, from recent Foreign Office telegrams, that publicists otherwisefriendly to this country were willing to contemplate the rup-ture of the Alliance without regret.    The French Chauvinistswere in the ascendant, and we might be confronted with a french Govrmment bent on attacking Germany in her hour of weakness, with the aid of Poland,  and there would be a strongcurrent of feeling in this country against breaking the alliance because of the number of English dead buried in the soil of France.    That was a very alarming possibility whichwe should do pur utmost, to prevent.In the course of the subsequent discussion, whilegeneral sympathy was expressed with the suggestion of a mutudLguarantee if it could secure a steadier French policy, strongevidence was adduced to show that it would probably not onlybe wrongly interpreted by the French Government but, in thepresent Chauvinistic mood of the French Parliament,  actuallyresented,    ho approach in the sense of the proposal had beenmade by any responsible French statesman duringthe^last twoyears, and on a recent occasion when the idea was/Ventilatedin this country it did not appear to b   welcomed in France,
It was also necessary to- bear in mind the attitude of Parlia-ment and public opinion in this country, and in the Dominionswhich would be very suspicions of any written undertaking.Further, there was not the slightest piospeot that any such agreement, if concluded, would modify the anti-British policypursued by France wherever British and French interestsimpinged.    What hope of Improvement there ..ight be lay inthe direction of a revival in France itself of an anti-Chauvinistic movement which had characterised France at various periods during the lSth Century.,    It was also non-tended that when the French Government fully realised thataggressive military action on her part would rupture the alliance, she would hesitate and would almost certainly notmarch into the Ruhr.The (Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs statedthat he had prepared a Paper on the whole question, which hewould like the Cabinet to consider Toefore reaching a deei-sion.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the situation was not ripe for actionbeyond possibly the most tentative approachesof a very informal kind in order to ascertain the probable attitude of ths French government towards a mutual guarantee of military assist-ance in the case of an unprovoked attack byGermany:(b) To postpone all action, and to adjourn thefurther consideration of the subject untilthe Cabinet had before them the Memorandumby the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,
(5) With reference to Cabinet 35 (21), conclusions and 3, the Prime Minister gave the Cabinet an accountof the informal conversations which had taken place between himself and certain Ministers and certainrepresentatives of the coal-owners and miners.     the conversations were proceeding, but had not reached a stage when any definite proposals could usefully becommunicated to the Cabinet or to the House of Commons.The Cabinet took note cf the PrimeMinisters statement and concurred with him that there could be no question of any increase in the amount of the temporaryfinancial assistance ( 10,000,000) whichthe Government had already offered tothe miners.The Secretary of State for India asked that his view should be recorded: that If a permanent settlement to which all parties were willing to subscribe couldbe achieved only by some increase in the temporaryfinancial assistance, refusal to provide such increase would not be justifiedcWhitehall Gardens, S.W.,May 24th, 1921.
