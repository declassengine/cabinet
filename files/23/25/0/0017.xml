I &apos;, 1 210LrCMATES (1) With, reference to Cabinet 28 (21), Conclusion 5   theW JO &apos;Cabd.nei\.had-before them a Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seallouse offoffimcns.       covering the recommendations of an informal Committee of theHouse of Commons which had considered the proposal to set up an Estimates Committee and its powers (Paper C.P,--2881).Inter alia, the Committee recommended that the Estimates Com-mittee and the Select Committee on National Expenditure shouldbe merged into one, and that the Committee should have no powerto deal with questions of policy or to advocate increased ex-penditure.    Its functions should be to examine Estimates inthe light of the Government&apos;a policy, with a view to discover^any possible economies and any items which appear-wasteorunnecessary expenditure, or seem likely to lead to large in-ereases of expenditure in future years,In the course of the discussion attention was drawn tothe danger of the limited powers of the proposed Committeeproving, in the opinion of the Committee, too restricted, andto this leading to a demand for greater powers, which might tento develop into the French system, of Committees and to the weakening 0*&quot; ministerial responsibility.    On the other hand, it washeld that the House of Commons was not likely to be willing to commit the determination of policy to a Committee,  that to define policy in advance was difficult,  and that it might be preferable to allow the Committee to be set up, and then the&apos;scope and powers of the Committee could be reviewed later, inthe light of experience,  if fresh demands were made.It was stated that before the War a Committee,notunlike the one now pro posed,.examined current Estimates    and made useful recommendations.    Further,  the demand in the Houseof Commons for some 3uch Committee was so pronounced as to makeit difficult for the Government to resist its appointment.Attention was directed to ih e importance of the selection of Chairman, and to the desirability or the reports by the Committee being informally shown to the Departmentsbefore publication,  so that, as far as possible.,    errors of fact might be eliminated..
The Cabinet agreed -

(a) That the recommendations of the Committee it should be approved:

(b) That the Lord Privy Seal should endeavour to secure agreement to the publication of the evidence of the Committee.

MEMBERS&apos; EXPENSES.

(2) With reference to Cabinet 23 (21), Conclusion 13,  the Cabinet had again before them the Report of the Select Committee on Members&apos; Expenses  (255/1922), a Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr Chamberlain)  summarising the recommendations of the Select Committee (Paper C.P.-2776), together with a letter which Mr Olynes had addressed to the Prime Minister (Paper CP.-2888)  advocating the grant to Members of Parlia-ment of an open pass on all railways, or,  failing that, a pass available between London and the Member&apos;s constituency and his home. Mr Clynos also asked for a greater allowance than  £100 at present exempted from Income Tax of the £400 paid to Members.

The Cabinet agreed --

(a) That the payment of £400 per annum to private members of Parliament should be treated as an allowance for expenses entirely exempted from income Tax:

(b) That there should be a grant of a first-class railway pass to and from London and the Member&apos;s constituency and, his home, and that this concession should Include Ministers:

(c) That the Treasury should take the necessary steps to give effect to the ?ve, and should arrange with the Ministry of Transport for a proportionate refund of the cost of season tickets taken out during the period since this question has been before the Cabinet.

GRANT OF BRITISH DECORATIONS TO ALLIED TOWNS

(3) The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War (Paper C.P.-2773) asking for a decision on the policy of granting British Decorations to Allied towns. The Secretary of State pointed out in his Memorandum that up to the present the only places that have been decorated are Verdun and Ypres.    Proposals to decorate other places have been negatived, the policy being regarded as undesirable from the military point of view, except perhaps in very special cases in thestres where British troops operated.


The Lord Privy Seal, read to the Cabinet a communication-fror&quot; Lord Stanfordharr on the subject.The Secretary of Stats for V/ar undertook to see Lord Stamfordharo.The Cabinet agreed  To postpone consideration of the matter.(4) With reference to Cabinet 15 (21), Conclusion 9,  the$RIAL-Cabinet had before them two Memoranda by toe First commissioner of Works and Public Buildings (Papers CP,-2643 and C. P.-2904)regarding the erection of the Guards&apos; Memorial in St.  James&apos;sPark.It was stated to the Cabinet that the scherre involved the erection of a Guards&apos; Memorial in St.  James&apos;s Park   oppositeto th0 Horse Guards entrance, and that it was desired at thesame time to make certain alterations in the roadways in that part of the Park,    The scheme was explained to the Cabinet bythe aid of plans, and it was shown that^ while considerablealterations would have to be made in the Park, there would beno diminution in the area within the railings  (which wouldactually be increased), and,  in addition, grass plots wouldbe laid in front of the India Office and Foreign Office, anda greater number of trees would ultimately be planted thanthose which would have to be destroyed.Emphasis was laid on the desirability of securing thatthe Memorial to be erected should be a proper and suitable one,in vie-&quot;-- of the fact that the site for the Memorial was being provided at public expense.    The Cabinet were assured that,although no plans had yet been prepared for the Memorial, everycare would be taken that the consent of the First commissioner of Aorks to the erection of the Memorial  should not be grantedunless the Memorial were a fitting one.Reference was also mad&quot; to the possibility of objection;being raised to the Memorial in the House of Commons.
The Cabinet agreed - (a) To give their general approval to theproposed site for the Guards&apos; Memorialreferred, to in the Memoranda by CheFirst Commissioner of Works  (PapersCP.-2643 and CP.-.3904.) :(b) To authorise the First Commissioner ofWorks to exhibit the plans for the site of the Memorial and the proposed tultera-tions in the Park, in the House of lords and the House of Comrrons:(c) To place on record their opinion that thefinal sanction o^ the First commissioner of Works to the erection of the Memorialshould not be given unless he were satis-fied as to its quality, but that in the meanwhile work on the roadway -right be proceeded with.!SUE OP (5) The Cabinet had before them a Note by- the Secretary[CENCBS to MARCONI covering a letter from the president  of the Board of Trade inJKPANY for   PRFCTTOMoonn^ction with the issue of licences to the Marconi CompanySTATIONSCOMMCNI- for the erection of stations to communicate with foreignWITHREIGN        countries (Paper CP.-2736).IUNTRI5S.During the course of a short discussion which tookplace, it was explained that,although so^e time had elapsed since the President of the hoard of Trade referred the matter to the Cabinet, no negotiations had taken place between the marconi Company and the General Post Office which would neces--sitate any alteration in tie terms of the letter which MrStanley Baldwin&apos;s Committee proposed to send to the marconi company.Regarding^ however,  the future policy to be adhered to in the working of the existing wireless stations belongingto the General Post Office, it was explained that-/from recent negotiations which had taken place with the Company, it seemed likely that they would not object to an arrangement whichwould provide for the existing Government wireless services between the United Kingdom and the Continent continuing to be* worked, and to a scheme for dividing up between theGeneral Post Office and the Company the wireless systems for communication with certain European coui :ries, px-jvided that
the arrangernent was extended to include wireless telephones.Further, in the event of such an arrangement being agreed to.it was pointed out that the Marconi Company would probably beready to accept the sum of  510,000 in settlement of the clainwhich they had made against the Admiralty for interception ofmessages during the recent war,  a sum which was regarded byall concerned as a very reasonable one.The Cabinet agreed - (a) To approve the Marconi Company beingcommunicated with on the lines pro-posed by Mr Stanley Baldwin in his letter to the Secretary, dated March11th, 1921:(b) To approve the Post Office continuing to work the existing Government wire-less stations erected -for communica-tion with - the Continent,  and negotia-tions being carried out with the marconi company with a view to an amicable ar-rangement being arrived at regarding their claim for intercepting messagesduring the War, and under which the wireless systems between the UnitedKingdom and the Continent will be shared by the General Post Officeand t he Company:(c) To ask the Secretary of State for theColonies if he would agree to CommanderHilton Young referring to him,for adecision,  any differences of opinion which may arise with any cf the Gov-ernment Departments as regards theterms of reference to the proposedArbitrator on the tviarccni Company&apos;sclaims, or on the Arbitrator&apos;^ doci-Dions;    the decision of the Secretaryof State for the Colonies to be binding on the Department concerned.
(6) with reference to Cabinet 23 (21), Conclusion 11, theCabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Minister of Trans-port (Paper C.P.-2905) regarding the representation of railway-men upon Railway Boards of Management.    This Memorandum reportedthat the men, without adequate consultation with the Ministerof Transport, had agreed with the Railway Companies that thereshould be no representation of the men on Boards of Management.The agreement with the Companies also provided for the con-tinuance of the National Wages Board and of the Central wages board, which had been extended to cover clerks, and, in addi-tion, for the establishment of Railway Councils composed ofofficers and employees.It was explained to the Cabinet that the leaders ofthe railwaymen had always pressed for the inclusion of menupon the Boards of Management, but that when they had come tonegotiate with the Railway Companies they had used the favour-able attitude already expressed by the Cabinet towards suchrepresentation as a lever for obtaining concessions in regardto the National Wages Board and the Central wages Board.    Theyhad, in fact, gone behind the backs of the Government.    Itwould,  of course, in the circumstances, be impossible for theGovernment to continue to press for the inclusion of men inthe Boards of Management.    The Minister of Transport was pre-pared to state in the mouse of Commons that the Cabinet hadbeen quite ready to carry through the policy of placing themen on the Boards of Management,  and that the men had beenfully aware of the government s point of view.    When, however,it came to negotiation with the Railway Companies, the men had changed their minds and had not insisted upon representation.Regret was expressed at the attitude taken up by the?m. who, it was said, had sacrificed for the sake of animmediate advantage a reform which would have far-reachingeffects through the whole of the industry.Attention was also drawn to Cabinet 23 (21), Conclu-sion 11 (d), in which the Cabinet had approved the placing
of a Guveriimerfcr Direct or -on Railway Boards cf Management, and. H        it was suggested that it was now unnecessary to insist on thisproposal.    The end in view could be attained satisfactorily bythe attendance of representatives of the Minister of transport at Board Meetings of Railways.    Objection was, however, raised to this proposal, since it was thought that if government representatives attended Meetings of Directors the Governmentwould place itself in a position of responsibility for the actions of Railway Companies.1 &apos;The Cabinet agreed  (a) To take note of the statement made by theMinister of Transport regarding the repre-sentation o^ men upon Railway Boards of management, and, in view of the fact that neither the Railway Companies nor the mendesire such a course, to approve the pro-posal that such representation should notbe provided for in the Railway Bill:(b) That  the proposal to place GovernmentDirectors cn Railway Boards of Managementshould be dropped, and that  it was nolonger necessary that the Governmentshould be represented at Beard Meetingsof Railway Compames .SEP (7) The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the MinisterRYIK- of Labour on the subject; of a pr coos a I that  there should be a:IALH Committee of Enquiry into Industrial Unrest  (Paper G.P.-8895).In reply to Questions on this subject in the House ofCommons the Prime Minister had stated,  on April 21st, that-some form of systematic enquiry into industrial unrest mightbe desirable, and that the Government were considering thequestion, but he did not think that, the appointment of a RoyalCommission would be the best means of eliciting information onthis important subject.The Cabinet were informed that Lord Robert Cecil wasaddressing today,  to the Prime Minister,  a Question to thefollowing effect:-
&quot;To ask the Prime Minister whether theGovernment have yet come to any deci-sion whether any, and,if so, what, formof enquiry should be made into Indus-trial unrest.&quot;The question for consideration was whether a detailedreply, giving the objections of the Government an outlined inrha Memorandum by me Minister of Labour referred to above(Pap^r 0,1.-2395) to the holding of an enquiry, should now begiven in the House of Commons, or whether a delaying answer should be given,in view of the fact that on April 28ththePrime Minister had stated in the Rouse of Commons  &quot;that a good deal of doubt has been extrpressed in many quarters as to the desir-ability of having an enquiry at thepresent moment.    He had had one or twovery important communications on thesubject and had promised to see repre-sentatives concerned and sore Members ofthe House before the Government  comes toa decision,.&quot;The Prime Minister had not yet had any interview onthis subject with the Members of the House of Commons.In favour of the former alternative it was pointed outthat the present was a convenient opportunity of reminding thepublicj whose attention was concentrated on the deadlock inthe Coal industry that in other industries a very great dealhad been done to settle the wage disputes by agreement.The Cabinet agreed  &quot;&quot;&quot;hat the Prime Minister should be advised to r*ply to Lord Robert Cecil to  the effectthat he was not yet in a position to give adefinite answer on behalf of the Government.

The principal recommendations of thisReport x-ere^ that as regards labour directly employedby Government Departments, the Nations 1 Federationof Building Trades Employers should be informed thatGovernment Departments would do their, utmost to apply the same principles as are laid down in the schemefor employment of ex-Service men by private employers.As regards contractsi the Report recommended thatGovernment Departments shotild urge contractors, inthe case of existing contracts, to take on their dueproportion of ex-Service meny and that future contracts should be let subject to the condition that the contractor was participating in the scheme for theemployment of ex-Service men in the Building Industry.As regards Housing Schemes,&apos; tho Report recommend4ed thet in the case of housing operations undertaker!by Local Authorities by direct labour/ the Ministry ofHealth and the Scottish Board of Health should urgeLocal Authorities to assist in carrying out the schemefor the employment of ex-Service men in the BuildingIndustry, and that the approval of direct labour schemes should in future be subject to the condition that theLocal Authority should co-operate in the- employmentof ex-Service men in its housing operations.    LocalAuthorities should also be urged to adopt    the same procedure as recommended for Government departments in regard to housing schemes carried out by contract.The same course should be followed with re/sard to
housing operations in connection with Land Settlement schemes.The Cabinet were informed that the Treasury had agreedstatementto they&apos; &apos; -      proposed to he made on behalf of the Governmentto the National Federation of Building Trades Employers.Attention was drawn to the fact that very slow pi ogresswas being made by the employers in carrying out their untertak-fnp to the Government iThe Cabinet agreed  To approve the proposals contained in theReport by the Committee on Co-operationof Government Departments in the employ-ment of ex-Service \ en in the BuildingIndustry (Paper 0, P.-2899) .,FIOIAL (9) With reference to Cabinet 15  (SI), Conclusion 7,  the[STORY^ THE v/AR, Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Secretary to theje of V/ar   Cabinet,  asking for the direction of the Cabinet as to the ex-cabinet, etc.feedings.tent to which the proceedings of such bodies as the War Council.Dardanelles Committee, War Committee, War Cabinet,  Imperial WarCabinet and Inter-Allied Conferences, may be made use of in the compilation of the Official History of the war (Paper C.P.-27^0).

With. reference to Cabinet 29 (21) Conclusion 38Proposals^ the -Oorrfarertce had under discussion-certain frosh.proposals with regard to the payment of Reparation byGermany which had emerged from discussions during thelast few days between the Cabinet Committee on reparations and M. Loucheur and Colonel Theunis.Sir Laming Worthington.-E.vans gave the Conference an outline of this scheme which had not yet been reducedto writing, but copies of which it was hopod would beavailable later in the day.Tho new proposals generally commended themselves totho Conference. but it was very strongly represented that the scheme for collecting 50$ of tho value ofImports from Germany in cash in the importing country andearmarking the amount so collected in partial satisfactionfor that country8s reparation claims should be incorporate-ated In the nev/ proposals.     It was pointed out that itwould te most dangorous for Great Britain to assent to any scheme which might have tho effect of giving Prance,Belgium and Italy substantial reparation while denying Itto herself, and that in the absence of most completeassurances and guarantees that Great Britain would get herfair share of Reparation, no steps should be taken to give up the 50$ scheme.The conference were informed that it would bepossible to incorporate the 50$ scheme in the new proposals by treating the 50$ as reparation in kind and by handing over to the German Government German ec71 bonds -equivalent *in value to the cash actually collected.     The suggestion was made without objection being taken that the 50$ could..be
2qbe reduced to Z5fo if Germany voluntarily aocepteu. this as one of the methods of paying Reparation.Objection was taken to the suggestion for including the50$ In the new proposals, on the ground that it would placeBritish traders at a disadvantage vis-a-vis German trade ascompared with traders of countries which had not imposed thepercentage arrangement.    It was also represented that if the50fa soheme was incorporated in the new proposals this should beclone in such a way that the proceeds would be credited to theCaisse la Dette and debited to the collecting country by way ofinterest, rather than that the amount collected should be treatedas Reparation in kind.   While it was generally recognised thatthis latter suggestion would in effect provide a satisfactory method of regulating exchange, doubts were expressed as towhether such an arrangement was administratively possible.It was agreed -*fi) that the 50$ on imports should not begiven up unless and until the BritishGovernment was entirely satisfiedthat the British Empire would receiveher ifair share of Reparation by someother method..(ii) that the members of the ReparationCommittee should give further consid-eration to the question of the basis on which tho 50$ scheme shculd be incorporated in the proposals.A copy of the new proposals as subsequently settled by the Secretary ot State for War Is attached (See Annex).
BR,ni?^rAIiLI3&apos;D     2. The Conferenoe were informed that the Prime Minister.UHE._-     proposed to have a preliminary informal talk with M.Briand and to confer with the Heads of the Delegations this afternoon.     He would press the French Delegates for their plan and propose that after some general discussion thetechnloal questions should be referred to a Joint Committeeof the Expert Ministers concerned assisted by financialExperts.
9 9 KL C 03.     With reference to Cabinet 30 (21) Conclusion 2,the Conference was informed that it would be necessary totake action in the immediate future on the recommendations contained in the Report of the Supply Priority Sub-Committeeof the Supply and Transport Committee (CoP02884).The Conference agreed -otherthat while no/important action should betaken by the Government until afterMay 1st,., every effort should be made to expedite the landing in the oountry offoreign coal.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.89th April, 1921.-4-fpihTlON.w

Witli reference to H.A.C.-81, Minute 2 (3), the Committee had under consideration a Memorandum by the Minister of Health(C.P.-2836), to which were attached suggested clauses of a Bill toenable Water Companies to increase their charges. It appeared that at the present time many Water - Companies and LocalAuthorities found that the revenue derived from their statutorycharges were insufficient to meet expenditure, and that some thirtyPrivate Bills and Provisional Orders were being promoted that.Session to enable the statutory charges to be raised. It was,therefore, proposed to pass a short general Bill empowering theMinister of Health, by Order, to raise or lower water charges on theapplication of the undertakers, or of any Local Authority acting; within the limits of supply. Any Order objected to would requireto be confirmed by Parliament. The Bill could fairly be said to henon-controversial.[6164]
It was explained to the Committee that the draft clauses f)proposed conferred on the Minister of Health substantially thesame powers as those inserted in private Bills which had receivedthe sanction of Parliament.The Committee agreed To authorise the Minister of Health to prepare a Bill on thelines of the clauses submitted, and to introduce it inParliament as soon as possible, subject to the approval ofthe Chief Whip.Preservation of 2. With reference to Cabinet 13 (20), Conclusion 9 (iii), thePublic Order: Committee had under consideration a Memorandum by the HomeDraft Bill. - -----Secretary (CP.-2767), covering the draft of a Bill for the more effective preservation of public order by providing summary powers for dealing with seditious speeches and writings. The draft bill had been prepared by a Committee consisting of the Home Secretary,the Law Officers and the Director of Public Prosecutions.The Home Secretary explained that, apart from regulations under the Defence of the Realm Act, it was only possible toproceed against persons making seditious speeches or publishingseditious writings by the cumbrous and old-fashioned procedure] ofan indictment for sedition. The summary prosecutions which had recently taken place in several instances had been taken under theDefence of the Realm Act, and when that Act ceased to operateupon the formal conclusion of peace, there would be no adequatepowers of dealing promptly with offences of this character. Themain purpose of the Bill was to authorise the prosecution, either onindictment or by summary proceedings, of any person who directly or indirectly advocates the unlawful use of violence or the com-mission of injury to person or property (Clause 1 (a) ).The Solicitor-General pointed out that the amormt of proofrequired on an indictment for sedition at common law was soconsiderable that it wTas not a suitable means of proceeding. so soon as the Defence of the Realm Act came to an end, theauthorities would have no powers for dealing with minor offences,and would be unable to check foreign revolutionary propaganda.The Bill did not create any new offences, with the possible exceptionof Clause 1 (c), which makes it an offence to be a member of, orcontribute to, the funds of any society whose object is to do any ofthe acts prohibited by the Bill.Doubts were expressed whether at the present juncture it was desirable to proceed with legislation of this character. It might bethought to show undue nervoiisness on the part of the Government,and might be regarded as provocative.Moreover, the powers in the Bill would lend themselves to thepossibility of great abuse, and would be regarded by many as anattack on the liberty of the subject. The Bill would undoubtedlyprovoke opposition in the House of Commons, and its provisionsmust therefore be carefully examined from that point of view.The view was generally held that no Bill of the kind should beintroduced during the present coal dispute. On the other hand, itwas pointed out that the question of policy whether a Bill of thiskind should lie passed in the near future would , haA^e to bedecided by the Cabinet, and. in order to avoid further delay,should the Cabinet sanction the introduction of such a measure,the Bill should be examined and revised in order that the cabinet might have the proposals before them in a complete and final form.The Committee accordingly proceeded to examine the clauses of the Bill, and suggested the following amendments :  Clause 1 (a) should be redrafted in less cumbrous language, andin particular the words &quot; suggests &quot; and &quot; whether orally or inwriting or otherwise &quot; should be deleted.
Clause 1 (6) should be reconsidered with a view to omitting itor incorporating it in Clause 1 (a).The following should be omitted : Clause 1 (c) : The whole.Clause 1 (cZ) : Words in square brackets.Clause 1 (e) : The whole.Clause 1 (/): The words &quot;gives or.&quot;Clause 2 should be amended as follows : Clause 2 (a) : After &quot; publication &quot; insert &quot; in this country.&quot;Clause 2 (6) : Insert, if possible, words to cover the transferof credit by telegram, as well as the importation ofspecie.Clause -I (5) : To be reconsidered in the light of Clause 1 (b)in its final form.The Bill should be applied to Scotland, and the views of theIrish Office should be invited in regard to Ireland.The Committee agreed (1.) That it would be inopportune to introduce such a measureduring the present industrial crisis.&apos; (2.) That the Bill should be referred back to the drafting committee, consisting of the Home Secretary, the LawOfficers and the Director of Public Prosecutions, for revision in the light of the above discussion, and shouldbe resubmitted to the Home Affairs Committee.The Committee had under consideration Memoranda by theSecretary for Scotland (0. P.-2846) and First Commissioner ofWorks (C.P.-2847) on the retention of allotments in King&apos;s Park,Edinburgh, from which it appeared that, in accordance with thegeneral principle that Royal Parks maintained at public expense forthe benefit of the people should be restored to their proper use assoon as possible, it was proposed that some 17 acres of allotmentsin the King&apos;s Park, Edinburgh, should be surrendered in February1922. The Secretary for Scotland asked that the allotments shouldbe allowed to remain until it appeared that they materially interferewith the legitimate public use of the park.The First Commissioner of Works, with a view to compromise,was prepared to agree to an extension to the end of February 1923in final settlement of the matter.The Secretary for Scotland stated that the retention of theallotments was not objected to by any of the Edinburgh authoritiesand no complaints had been received. An additional reason forpressing his point of view was that before the war the space inquestion had not been properly tended, and had been used largelyas a dumping ground for refuse.The First Commissioner undertook, on the other hand, thatwhen the allotments were removed the space would be planted orproperly laid out and made suitable for the enjoyment of the public.It was required to improve; the general amenities of the park.The Committee agreed  That the allotments in King&apos;s Park,- Edinburgh, should be finally surrendered in February .1923.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,April 28, 1921.
