COAL RESTRICTIONS-

2. With reference to Cabinet 29 (21) Conclusion 1, the Cabinet had before them a Report of the  supply Priority sub-Committee of the supply and transport committee (C.P.28840).

The Chairman of the supply Priority Sub-Committee explained that if the Miners accepted the latest Government offer, the stops proposed in the Report of his Sub-Committee would not, of course, require to be taken. If, however, the Miners decided still to remain on strike it was, in the opinion of the supply Priority Sub-Committee, essential that the 1st May should inaugurate a different regime in regard to coal economies. A prolonged coal strike was far more dangerous than a railway strike, although the danger was less apparent.

The country had now passed through 28 coal-less days and on the figures which had been put before them the Supply Priority Sub-Committee estimated that at the present rate of consumption the greater part of the reserve hold for railways, electricity, gas and water, would be consumed by May 19th.

Even if the strike were settled by that date it would take a considerable time to render coal supplies available once more. The exhaustion of coal stocks would involve a complete breakdown throughout the country. The Sub-Commit too therefore recommended that 10 days&apos; reserve of ooal should be kept, in order to enable industry to be revived during the period immediately after a settlements.

The full recommendations of the Sub-Committee were as follows:-

(1) That at least 10 days&apos; stock of coal at the present rate of consumption be kept in hand, to enable the country to begin to recover after the resumption of work at the mines.


-JS-C&amp;)   !rhat laxge-^urch^es of eroal from abroadought to be made immediately.(3)    That stringent restrictions should beplaced on the use of fuel, on the linesof the Schedule -annexed tc 0 &quot;P^B034,  such restrictions to be brought into force on May 1st.(4)    That immediate publicity should be givento the forthcoming imposition cf theseres trict ions *It was difficult tc estimate the precise effect which the stops proposed would have but it was thoughtthat they would result in a saving of 1.0 days1 supplies^This would enable the country to live on its presentcoal stocks until Hay 20th and at the same time, to havea stock of 10 days1 coal in hand.As regards publication the failure of tho threat of a Triple Alliance Strike had led the ceuutry to suppose that all difficulties were    over.     The impositionof drastic restrictions would bring about a realisation of the actual position and it would bring publicopinion to boar on the Miners and on their leaders.It was suggested that the working out of the detailsof tho proposed restrictions should be left to theDepartments concerned, and that a Committee of Officialsrepresenting those Departments and the PublicityDepartment should work cut the arrangements necessaryfor the operation of the restrictions by Monday, May2nd.,,Attention was drawn to tie possibility, in spiteof the rejection by the Miners Delegate Conference,cf the Miners themselves returning to work in view&apos;of the latest Government offer*
It was stated, that in certain districts, especially South Wales where the cut was now 3/- instead of the original 7/-, many men were quite willing to go back. It was therefore important that nothing should he done at any rate in the next few hours, to counteract tendencies for peace among the Miners. The purchase of coal for industry would have this effect. Restrictions of coal to breweries, such as were suggested In the Schedule to C.P.2804, would be very unpopular and it was to be feared that if the restrictions suggested, particularly these in regard to industrial coal, were enforced the result would be great unemployment and strong feeling against the Government amongst the working classes generally.

Attention was drawn to the vital necessity of refraining from action of a "panic" nature.

It was urged that the effect of the immediate imposition of the restrictions suggested by the Supply Priority Sub-Committee might be, not the awakening of public opinion against the Miners but firstly the realisation by extreme labour that they had the Government at their mercy and only required to remain on strike for a few more days; and secondly to enrage the mass of the people, not with the miners but with the Government for     forcing do control on the Miners. The result would be an intolerable pressure on the Government to yield at any price.

It was impossible to estimate the supplies of coal in the country but theso were always much greater than was expected. Moreover, purchases from abroad were already being made and 44,000 tons of coal were en route from Europe to this country and negotiations were being conducted for the purchase of 76,000 additional tons which would be imported from Europe next week. So far no purchases had been made from the United States of America because of the distance and of the unfavourable rate of exchange, but it might be necessary during the
next week to negotiate such purchases and a preliminary enquiry for 200,000 ? of American coal had been inst?. Moreover, the Coal Mines ? had discoveres that in Scotland there were 257,000 tons and in Yorkshire 75,000 tons of pit-hoad coal which could, contrary to expectation, be moved. This was a good instance of the way in which now stores of supply were constantly being found. A census of 8,000 industrial establishments was being taken and returns had been received iron 20O0; which showed that, for those 2,000 factories there was a reserve of 204,000 tons of coal which would enable them to carry on for some time.

The opinion was expressed that if all thw restrictions suggested by the Supply Priority Sub-Committee were brought into force on Monday, May 2nd the result would be to encourage the Miners and exasperate public opinion. In view, however, of the urgent necessity of conserving coal it was obviously necessary to enforce some restrictions and it was suggested that the Supply and Transport Committee should at once consider the imposition of restrictions on Monday, May 2nd on the following classes of consumption

Street and public lighting

Sunday Services

Pleasure services on the River

Lighting in public conveyances and

Bunkering

The Committee should also consider the question of bringing forward summertime one hour and imposing Curfew.

It was urged that the policy of restriction should be combined with a less advertisement of that policy.

The Cabinet agreed:-

(1) that in view of the labour Demonstrations which would take place on May 1st and of the importance of ascertaining how the decision of the Miners Delegate Conference would be received in the districts during the week end it was undesirable to take overt action before Monday.


(2) That the Departments concerned ehoriidindividually examine the- recommendationsof Mr Churchill&apos;s Sub-Committee and re-port upon them immediately to the Supplyand Transport Committee.(3) That the Supply and Transport Committeeshould consider the advisability of put-ting into force on Monday, or later, cer-tain restrictions, such as those dealingwith Public Lighting,  Sunday and PleasureServices, Daylight Saving, and Curfew,leaving for further Cabinet consideration the major restrictions.(4) That the Supply and Transport Committeeshould consider what legal powers theGovernment possesses or requires for putting into force the whole of the re-commendations outlined by Mr Churchill&apos;sCommittee,(5) That the President of the Board of trade should be authorised to purchase 500,/J00tons of coal from the Ocnhinent, in addi-tion to the purchases elre-dy concluded,and should postpone purchases in theUnited States until the probable durationo-f the dispute became mere defined anduntil more complete information had beenreceived as to the rats of depletion ofcoal stocks.jpSAL OP (S) The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the MinisterIKS PORTfKERS TO       of Labour (Paper CP.-2886) regarding the instructions issuedIDLE COAL.by the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation to their members to refuse to handle coal.It was explained to the Cabinet that whereas theNational Union of Railwaymen had reversed their decision and now confined the embargo to coal used for industrial pur-poses, the Transport Workers&apos; Federation refused to allowtheir members to handle any coal in ships, owing to thedifficulty of distinguishing in a cargo of coal between coal to be used for industrial purposes and coal to be used forother purposes.    Two courses of action were open to theMinister of Labour:-(i) To attempt to negotiate with the TransportWorkers *&apos; Federation an agreement that theFederation would -follow the line of actionadopted by the National Union of Railwaymen,or(ii) To inform; Sir Joseph Broodbank, the Chairmanof the National Council of Port Labour Employ-ers, that the Employers were at liberty to\ise non-Union labour.-6-
If the latter course were-adopted, the Transport workers would undoubtedly go on strike.    The objection to the formercourse was that its adoption would be an admission of theright of a Trade Union to discriminate between classes oftraffic which its members might handle.    It would be danger-ous to make any concession on such a vital question of prin-ciple.^he Cabinet were reminded that, at the present stage,it we,s important to do nothing to antagonise Labour, and they agreed That the Minister of Labour should be requested to communicate to the employers of fort labour the view of the Governmentthat at the moment no notice should betaken of the instructions issued by theNational Transport Workers1  Federation.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,April 28, 1921.
