of Ministers held at 6 p.r .on April 13th,B INDUSTRIAL     (1) With reference to thb confer:nce / Conclusions 1 &amp; 8,situation. /the - Prljw-mni^-ter inforced his celleagues of the lateste Presentsition        position.    On the previous evening two meetings had takenbon)place in the House of Commons, when first the Mine-owners and afterwards Mr Prank Hodges had addressed a group ofMembers.   The latter had made the more favourable impres-sion of the two.    Towards 11-30 p.ir.. a question had been shot at him asking if he was prepared to discuss wages, andhe had replied 5n the affLrmative.    In answer to anotherquestion he had said that he was prepared to postpone thequestion of the pool and discuss a temporary solution ofwages only.    No record had been taken, and a group of Members,whom the Prime Minister had seen after midnight, had not agree-d as to exactly what Mr Hodges did say.    The PrimeMinister had, however, felt the matter was sufficientlyimportant to necessitate his writing to th? Miners&apos; Pedera-tion inviting them to u;eet representatives of the Governmentand Mine-owners at 11 a.eh.  (See Appendix.)    He himself, withthe Lord Privy Seal, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theMinister of Labour, had proceeded to the Board of Trade, whenthey had m^t the owners, but the Miners&apos; Federation had not put in an appearance.    They were reported to have met togetherfirst, and afterwards to have repaired upstairs at Unity house to meet the Transport Workers and Railwaymen.   A definite answer had been promised in half an hour&apos;s time.The Cabinet agreed -That the Lord Privy Seal should communi-cate the irain facts of th^ situation tothe House of Commcns, and make such ar-rangements^as were consistent with theStanding RuIolTf in order to enable thePrime Minister to make a statement assoon as the situation was sufficiently clear to render this desirable.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, pril 1*. 1921.
I20. APPENDIX.&quot;10, Downing Street, S,W.1.April 15th, 1921.Dear Mr* Hodges,Several Members who were present at your House ofCommons Meeting last night have conveyed to me thepurport of your concluding offer*     They had not takendown the actual words you used, hut the general impression made cn their minds was that you were now prepared to discuss with the owners the question ofwages without raising the oontrover-sial irisue of the&quot;pool&quot;, provided the arrangements to be made were of atemporary character and without prejudice to a further discussion of proposals for a national pool when apermanent settlement comes to be dealt with*If this is a fair re pre sent at ion of your suggestionI invite you and your fellow delegates to meet theowners at the Board of Trade at 11 this morning toconsider the best method of examining the question ofwages *Yours faithfully,(Signed) D. LLOYD GEORGE.
