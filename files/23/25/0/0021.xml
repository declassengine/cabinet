(3) With reference to Cabinet If) (21), Conclusion 2,the Cabinet had before them the following documents relat-ing to the question of Afghanistan:--A collectsor -of telegrams which have passed between the Government of Indiaand the Secretary of State for India(Paper 0.P.-2920),A Memorandum by the secretary of Statefor India  (Paper CP.-2922) .After a fall discussion, and after hearing the viewsof Lord Chelmsford,  the late Viceroy of India,  the cabinet agreed  (a)  That the- Secretary of State for india should inform the Government of india that tho Cabinet were strongly of opinionthat an effort should be made to offerAfghanistan sufficient indue event in money and arms to make her throw over the Pol-shevist Treaty entirely, and that a de.fi-nite effort should be made to secure thiseven though it might involve a largerexpenditure than the maximuma** present contemplated by the Govern-ment of India, -*r even the 40 lakhs which sir Henry Dobbs thinks to be necessary:j      (b)  That the Secretary of State&apos; for  India shouldalso inform the Government of India that- they would not oppose the adoption,  in thelast resort,  of the third proposal, namely,i , to try to modify the British draft treat in unesse-ntials so as to render it accept-/ able to the Amir, while granting an annualsubsidy up to 25 or even 30 lakhs:(c) That the willingness of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment t o accept the third proposal  a proposal which they strongly disliked  should at this stage be conveyed to theViceroy only, so that -he may be in possessionof the Cabinet*s whole mind on the question;but care should be  taken that it did not become known at Kabul while the first andlarg r proposal was being negotiated:(d) That, in advancing either the larger policy the limited alternative proposal, sir henry mobbs should firmly maintain HisMajesty&apos;s Government&apos;s objection to  theestablishment of Russian Ccrsulates in eastern Afghanistan:(e) That the Secretary of State for India shouldpre pane a telegram-, to the Viceroy on theabove lines, and should circulate it to thePrime Minister, the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, and the Secretary of Statefor the Colon 1 es ba fore forward 1 ng it.(See Appendix .    ).
INTER-ALLIED AND AMERICAN DEBTS.

(4)With reference to Cabinet 5 (21), Conclusion 1, the Cabinet had before them Memoranda by both the late and the present Chancellors of the Exchequer on the subject of the release of the subregated securities (Papers. C.P.2705 and C.P.-2075), and also a Note by Mr Chamberlain advering suggestions by M. Loucheur for dealing with inter-Allied and American debts (Paper CP.-2716).

In Paper C.P.-2705 Mr Chamberlain had urged that Lord Chalmer departure for America, which had been delayed by the Cabinet decision of February 7, 1921, referred to above, should be hastened in order to facilitate the return to their owners of the subrogated securities by Maroh 31, 1922, in default ef which payments will have to be made to the owners at a cost Â£17,500,000. Moreover, the 1/2 per cent, additional interest was costing the Exchequer approximately 1,000 a day, plus administration expenses. 

In Paper C.P.-28375 Sir Robert Horne suggested that the British Ambassador in Washington should be asked to request the immediate release of the sub?gated securities independently of the general question of conversion of our demand notes into long-term bonds, the United State Treasury being assured that our premise to pay will be equally binding without this specific Security far a part of the whole.

on the one the hand, it was urged that the won now ripe for resuming the negotiations for the settlement of the general question of Anglo-American ?btainess, that the new American Administration was not likely to take a very different view of the guestion from that taken by its predecessor, and that further delay was inconsistent with the National dignity, ? damaging to our credit, and might poison our future relations with the United States of America. On the other hand, it was pointed out that no harm had accrued from the delays in the past, that the new American Administration ? disposed to adopt a more conciliatory attitude towards the whole question of
Inter-Allied indebtedness, and, if given time,, might wellbe guided towards the policy of universal cancellation.Moreover, it might shortly be possible to arrange withthe American Government for the substitution of german reporation Ponds of Series A. for the Subrogated securities,and so secure th** release of the latter.It was agreed  That for the present no action shouldbe taken in the direction of approach-ing th/-- American Government as regardseither the release of the subrogatedsecurities or th-- general question of anglo-American indebtedness.(The lord Privy Seal..,requested that hisdissent t-from the decision a;?aln to post-pone the reopening of ,ne;-:o tiations withthe Arrerican Government shcul I be re-corded.. )2, Whitehall Gardens, S.w.1,May 10.&apos;1921.-5-
L L ? E w D I X.Circulate^SECRET-CJ.Pc.2939,The following telegram, which was issued with thecoriourrtiuce of the &apos;Pi&apos;lme Minister, Lord Ours on, and Mr. Churchillis circulated, with reference to Cabinet 57 (21), Conclusion 3cf 10th May.W    5    7. IfXtl. O . III.12th May, 1921aPROM SECRETARY OF STATE TO VICEROY, FOREIGNDEPARTMENT, 11th May,  1921.Clear the line.SECRET.    Afghanistan.     His Majesty1s Government have now given the most careful consideration to your telegram of the5th May.      I understand that your view is that the best formof treaty would be one which would exclude the Russians fromAfghanistan; but that If such a treaty could not be concluded,rather than no treaty you would suggest., in view of the considerations you have brought to our notice, a treaty which would not exclude the possibility of the Afghans gettingarras and a subsidy from the Russians02.    Ris Majesty1a Government entirely agree with you asto tho first alternative.      It Is eminently desirable that weshould administer a diplomatic defeat tc the Russians at Kabul;that we should convince the Amir- that he has nothing to gain from Bolsheviks and everything to gain by friendship with us,and that by taking our advice on his relations with foreign powers he will avoid again getting into a dilemma like thepresents     We do not believe in the capacity of the Bolsheviksto continue payments of large sums of money*      On the other hand,the Amir must know that he can rely upon any undertaking we make.In order to get rid of both the Bolshevik treaty and theBolsheviks themselves, we would agree, and indeed urge you.,,to go to the very limits of your financial Capacity in thisdirection.      We note &quot;that you mention 30 lakhs, and thatDobbs suggested 40 lakhs annual and one orore initial.     Havingregard to the present value cf money and the comparable costof tribal warfare, we would urge ?/ou not to put too low a limitupon the expenditure necessary to produce so desirable a resultsPromise him the arms that he wants;    give him every assurance of assistance short of direct military intervention againstunprovoked aggression by the Russians, and real friendshipif he will give up his treaty with Moscow and dismiss theBolshevik Mission,     We note that you think it Impossibleto demand the latter.      It is, however, the logical conclusionof the policy which we wish Amir to pursurh and while Dobbsmust determine by what means it can best be secured, he will naturally regulate his offer of money, &amp;c , according to thecompleteness of Bolshevik elimination,3.    This then is the most desirable course- and no effort should be spared to get it; and so far as we cr.   judge thesituation here, we cannot help thinking that a persistentand firm attitude will achieve success if negotiations are nothurried.
4.    As regards the alternative, His Majesty1s government still hold the view expressed -in my previous telegrams, theview that you. are familiar with from your presence at theCabinet at which this matter was last discussed before youleft England.     That India should be paying a subsidy to the amir whilst at.the same time he had formed a treaty underwhich he was receiving money from the Bolsheviks is asolution which we find difficult to justify, and to which wecould assent only with the most extreme reluctance^     Itopens up. unlimited possibilities for the Amir to play us offagainst the Russiansj, and the Russians off against us;applying to each in turn for an Increase in subsidy, and seeking every opportunity to profit by any dissensionsbetween Russia and ourselves..     While Russia is governed bya Bolshevik Government with its known hostility to theBritish Empire, with its known desire to wound what theydescribe as a capitalist Government through the East, theobjections are obvious, and even if Russia were once againanimated by a similar policy to trhat which animated it underthe Czarlst regime, the objections would be equally, if notmore, obvious.     We should, therefore, infinitely prefer:that such an arrangement should not be contemplated,, but his Majesty&apos;s. Government recognise that you are thoroughlyfamiliar with these views and that you must have appreciatedtheir force in recommending s&amp;ch a course for our approvalsTherefore, if In the event, of Dobbs&apos; failure, you tell us thatyou still remain convinced that it is better to concludesuch a treaty than to have no treaty at all, in the last resort we should be willing to acquiesce, and we recognise thatit is only right to Inform you     this stage to that effect.You will, I presume, instruct Dobbs to do all in his power with force and. firmness to get the exclusive treaty.   Howfar you will take him into your confidence as to thepossibility of the&quot;pis aller&quot;, I must leave to your discretion.On .the other hand, it is obviously desirable that he shouldbe in- full possession of our aims and purpose.     On the other,we are so reluctant to assent to the second alternative,and so anxious to secure the first, that we do not want to risk,weakening his patience or endeavour by too early a recognition that failure does not necessarily mean rupture.     There isalso to be considered that at Kabul, where everything gets    -known, the Amir&apos; may learn of the possibility of an alternativewhich may lead him to new bargaining with the Russians.However, I leave that with complete confidence to you,&apos;In all that I have said, I have assumed your Intentionto be that even the second alternative should be conditional upon, disclosure of the Bolshevik treaty and cancellation ofthe Consulates on our frontier.In conclusion, we must take care that Amir does not give to Angora the facilities for threatening India which we shallbe paying him heavily to refuse to Moscow, and I should be glad to know how you propose to deal with situation created by Turco-Afghan Treaty.
