3. After consideration of the recommendations of theCommittee of Imperial Defence on Military Policy in Egypt(Paper CP.-42.4 (23)), as well as other Papers which had-been laid before the Committee of Imperial Defence, namelyA Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Vvar(C. I. D.Paper No.439-B, Revised):A Memorandum by the Foreign Office (c.I.D.Papern0.446-B):A Memorandum by the Colonial Office (C.I.D.Paper- No.448-B) :A Memorandum by Lord Salisbury (C.I.D.

Paper 454-B)jthe Cabinet agreed  (a) To adopt the following recommendations ofthe Committee of Imperial Defence:.-(i) That from the point of view of ImperialDefence the vital requirement is thesecurity of the Suez Canal.    It is also .of great strategical importance to main-tain our aerial establishments in Egypt,particularly those at Heliopolis (nearCairo) and Aboukir (near Alexandria),which constitute the air supply centre for the whole of the Middle East.    the radio-telegraphic station at AbuSabel,near Cairo- is also of strategicalImportance.(ii) From the military point of view it Isessential to maintain a military foroe(a) within striking distance of Cairo,in order to secure&quot;the Sues Canal, toprotect the sweet water canal, the wire-less station at Abuzabel and the aerodrome at Heliopolis, and (b) within strikingdistance &apos;of Alexandria, in order to providefor the security of the Air Force Estab-lishments at Aboukir.military policy and-^feiice of18z Canal.previous reference:Cabinet 17(23), Con-conclusion 5. )(v)The question of the size and eventuallocation of the garrison and Air Force isreserved for further consideration.    TheJlK&amp;a^-Offfic&apos;o oneEr-jfr&amp;r&apos;1,1 Statfjrs will examinethe question in concert, and discuss
4&quot;&amp; rj *3their proposals with the Chairmanof the Committee of Imperial defence and the Seoretary of State for ForeignAffairs. with a view to submitting-  them to the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs warned the Cabinet that, while he acceptedthe principles recommended by the Committee&apos;of Imperial Defence, he anticipated greatdifficulty in carrying them into effect inhis future negotiations with the egyptian government.    The opposition in Egypt might even involve a rising against the Britishtroops.(b) That the following additional reooinmendationsshould be reserved for further consideration(iii) The maintenance of troops at Cairoitself and at Alexandria, thoughdesirable, is not essential from amilitary point of view, and would be extremely difficult to secure.(iv) Having regard to the military eonsid-considerations on the one hand, and to the difficult diploiratic situation on theother, the best course will be, inany negotiations that take place withthe Egyptian Government, to maintainBritish Military Forces at Abbasia,near .Cairo, and at Mustapha Barracks,near Alexandria, and in return to relinquish the Barracks actuallysituated in those cities.(o) That the Lord President of the Council shouldbe authorised to make to the Imperial Confer-ence a statement of a general nature, to theeffect that the British Government regarded the security of British communications throughthe Suez Canal as the cornerstone of ourImperial Defence Policy, and were taking stepsto secure these c ommunic at ions.
i^a ration. 4. The attention of the Cabinet was called to the urgent and .im&apos;aiediate danger to British Industry, which had beenJevious        mentioned at the previous meeting, from the possible dumping,ferenoe:oinet 47     both In this country and elsewhere9 by arrangement between ), Con-conclusion 2,)   French and German industrialists, of the large stocks ofsteel at present in the Ruhr..    The Cabinet were informedthat the situation was now far more urgent than it had been on the previous occasion (September 26th) as organisations,were being formed for the disposal of the stocks of steel in the Ruhr, amounting to between 13000,000 and 2,000,000tons.    The French Government were in physical possessionof these stocks and were in a position either to launchthem on the market, with disastrous results, or to make arrangements with German firms to place them on the market-It was known that a British firm was in negotiation for300,000 tons of this steel.    It was anticipated that the.sals of these stocks might begin during the present weekif no action was taken to safeguard the xjosition.In view of the imminent risk involved, the cabinet agreed --(a) That immediate steps should be taken to propose to our Allies that an Inter-allied commission.should be formed to take chargeof and to control the sale of all stocks ofsteel and other commodities produced in the Ruhr:(b) That the drafting of the Note making thisproposal to the Allied Governments wouldrequire very great care, in view of therisk of our becoming involved in the Ruhroperation by participation in the proposed inter-Allied Commission, and in order toavoid any suggestion that, after havingrefused to run the risks of the Ruhroccupation, we were attempting to derivebenefit from the results.    The draftingshould therefore be entrusted to a committee composed of  The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The President of the Board of Trade,.or. their representatives:
-7-That if the situation should develop inan unfavourable manner, the Comirdtteoshould advise the Cabinet as to what action should be taken to pa?art the great risk toBritish trade and the complete underminingof the proposals of the Unsmplovment-. Com- &quot;mittee for stimulating employment in the steel industry, which would result from awholesale dumpings at ruinous prices ofthe stocks in the Ruhr.    Among proposals made under this head were, an early state- ..ment by the Prime Minister, and the: possiblesuxumoning of Parliament with a view to special legislation.

The Cabinet took note of  (a) A telegram sent by the Seoretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs to the American Govern-ment as the result of the discussions at theImperial Conference on Foreign &quot;Policy (No.299of October 12th) in regard to the possibilityof American co-operation in an Enquiry as tothe capacity of Germany to pay reparations:(b) A telegram from Mr Chi It on, Washington (No.-403of October 13th) stating that a friendly, thoughnon-committal,, reception&apos;-was given to the Britisho ommuni c at ion.
