(Tills Document is thei Property of His BritannicIvlajesty1s Government.,)&apos;CABINET 47  (23).CONCLUSIONS OP A MEETING OF SHE CABINET; held at10, Downing Street, S.W.1,  on WEDNESDAY,SEPTEMBER 26, 1923, at 11-30 a.m.Ioreign POLICY   1.     The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave theIjreece-Italy.   Cabinet a full account of events during the vacation affect-ing Foreign Policy, including more especially particulars-* ****of the crisis which had arisen between Greece and Italy,the Flume question and the recent coup d*etat in Spain.In regard to the former question Lord Gurzon explained thatit had arisen out of the murder on Greek territory ofGeneral Tellini, an   Italian officer who was President ofan International Commission appointed by the Conference of ambassadors in Paris to delimit the frontier betweenGreece and Albania.     The question had been complicated bythe attitude of Italy which had included the occupation andbombardment of the Greek island of Corfu without recourse to the procedure laid down in the Covenant.     Lord Curaonexplained the attitude of the different Powers, the partsplayed by the League of Nations and the Conference of ambassadors, and the reactions of the crisis on the wholeinternational situation.     The attitude of the BritishGovernment had been guided by the following principles(i) To hasten the completion of the enquiry into the origin of the crisis;(ii) To get the Italians to leave Corfu       thequestion being complicated by the difficulty which had arisen in regard to Flume:(iii) 3?o maintain the authority and prestige ofthe League of Nations and to prevent the
breakdovm of the provisions of the Covenant,which was at one time threatened:(iv) To prevent th3 spread of the conflagration:Cv) To maintain friendly co-operation vita our allies:(vi) as regards Italy, without adopting a hostileattitude , to iaake it quite clear to theItalian Gcverrjiijent ho\v public opinion inthis country felt on the question.In regard to the latest developments of the crisisLord Curzon read telegram No.343 of the 25th September,1923, to Lord Creyre, as well as Lord Crews&apos;s reply, and afurther tele grain which Lord Curson himself had despatchedthat morning (No. 344), in which he had authorisod LordCrev/e to agree to hand over immediately to Italy the50,000,000 lire deposited by the Greek Government.The Cabinet agreed --(a) To approve the action taken by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs and the british representatives at Geneve, in regard to theGreco-Italian crisis:(b) That the Seer &quot;tar;/ of State for ForeignAffairs had no alternative but to authoriseLord Creve to agree to the oon tout ion of theItalian GovernnSnt that the Greek&apos;.deposit of50,000,000 lire should be handed over tothemy the reasons for which am fully setforth in the following tele gram to LordOre&apos; e (No.344, of September 25, 1923)r-&quot;Argument of Italian Ambassador, which you were quite right to contest, appears to meto be insufficiently -Justified by preliminaryfindings of Commission, and to be inoonsist-ent with equities of ca.se.   For its accept-anoe. amounts in practice to this - thatmaximum penalty is to be imposed uponGreek government, although no evidenceof its complicity in crime has been forth-coming,&apos; that further proceedings of- Commission ar: discounted, and that reference to Permanent Court is abandoned.On the other hand the responsibility forthis paradoxical result would appear to lie with Ambassadors Conference itself.For whereas their note of September 8th,which was accepted both by Greek and italian governments, undoubtedly contemplated the determination of the indemnity by The Haguetribunal in accordance with tho verdict of commission, and although in their note of
September 15th the Ambassadors Confer-enoe announced the decision of theItalian government to evacuate Corfuin any case on 2?th September      yet the acceptance by the Ambassadors onthe seme date of Baron Avezaano&apos;declaration completely nullified theseengagements by allowing Italy to rideoff on the plea of Greek negligence.It does not indeed appear to&quot; be clear from Commission&apos; s report whether thenegligence attributed to the localGreek authorities was negligence inthe interval 1 mediately following the crime or negligence in the courseof the present enquiry.But the determination of this point ieirrelevant, for the reason that theItalian government is able on the pleaof Greek negligence, whenever and bywhomever exhibited, to claim that theconditions predicated in Baron Avezaano*declaration, which Ambassadors accepted,have been called into being, and thatit is therefore absolved from its promise of unconditional evacuation.In these circumstances * inasmuch asFrench government have thrown themselvesunreservedly on side of Italians, and ascontinued occupation of Corfu might leadto further disaster, I think you have no alternative but to defer to Italian con-tent ion.   Otherwise responsibility forcontinuance of crisis and,suspension of evacuation would be oast upon our shouldersalone.   I gather that this is the ooursewhich you yourself recommend as unavoidable.But I hope you will insist upon assurance that evacuation is proceeded with withoutfurther dela;v and is completed aa stipulatedon 27th.&quot;(c) That the Secretary of state for Foreign affairs should prepare a collection of the documents relating to this orisis, with a view to adecision as to v-hethsr or no it would be advisable to publish all or some of them inthe form of a Blue Book.
SEPARATIONS.i(previous reference:Cabinet 46(23)* Con-conclusion 2. )2.    The Prime3H,nlnter made a statement to hiscolleagues in regard to his recent conversation with M.Poincare&quot; in Paris on the subject of Reparations, an account of which he had already passed round to theCabinet.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs statedthat as the result of conversations with the Prime minister he proposed to sound ths Amerioan Ambassador as to whether there would be any prospect of the appointment of an american representative on the Reparation Commission ifthe American Government were approached by the BritishGovernment in conjunction with their Allies.   In thepresent state of American politics, however, he was nothopeful of a favourable reply, and he was even moredoubtful whether Francs would agree to approach theAmerioan Government on the subject.   ^   ,the Chancellor of the SxohequerThe Prime Minister,/and the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs were asked to consider a proposal that the-Prime Minister&apos;s conversation with M. Poincartfshould be followed up by an instruction to the british ambassador in Paris to keep in close touch with any negotiations botween the Frsnoh and German governments on the subject of reparations, and by a suggestion to theFrench Government that experts of . the British Governmentshould be placed in touch with experts of the FrenchGovernment, with a view to exploring the best method ofobtaining reparations from Germany.   This proposal was madein order, by establishing close contact between theBritish and French Governmentstto safeguard Britishindustry against the dangers of dumping which would threatenit (and more particularly the steel industry, in whichthere is already over-production) if, in the course of separate negotiations between the French and German
Governments and between French and German industrialists ,german industry should fall under the control of thatof France.
EARTHQUAKE    5. The Cabinet had before them correspondence betweenHi JAPAN.the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and Lord%oposediieiiiorial       Stamfordham, and other relevant Papers, in regard to a service.suggestion that a Memorial Service to those who lost their lives in the earthquake in Japan should be held at S&amp;.P&amp;u1&apos;bCathedral(Paper CP.-405(23)).After some discussion the Cabinet agreed  (a) That, in view of the time that had elapredsince the disaster, the lack of any religiousconnection between the British and Japanesenations, and the&apos;doubtful expediency ofestablishing a precedent, they would not wish to press the proposal:(b) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should inform His K&amp;jesty the Kingthat, on merits, the Cabinet were disposed to think it was not desirable to press theproposal.
Armistice day.(previousIk Reference:wCabinet 63A(22), Con-elusion 6.)4.    The Cabinet agreed  (a) That, with a view to putting the Cabinetin a position to decide what arrangements should be mads for the celebration of armistice Day, which falls on a Sundaythis year, the -Secretary of State forArchbishop of Canterbury and shouldafterwards approach the King on thesubject:(b) That the subject should be placed on theAgenda, if possible, at the next meetingof the Cabinet,.  .
1fclOBNOSS FOR        5. The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries informed&quot;potatoes[jSPORTBD FBOL- the Cabinet that last July he had received a Deputation\br0ad.on the subject of a licence for pota/toes imported fromi abroad.   The Deputation had urged him to bring the matterdeviousReference:     a pain before the Cabinet.   They had, however, not madefcabinet 20 -   ;1(25), Con-    out a good case.   The Deputation were now pressing for a[elusion 1(c)-). &quot;&quot; &apos;.-decision from.the&apos; Cabinet. -   The total importation of- , potatoes in the previous year had only formed&apos;8 per cent.of the total consumption.    This year the cx^op, at home andabroad was likely to be small, and there might even be ashortage of potatoes in the Spring.The Cabinet were further informed that a licenceon the importation of foreign potatoes would be verydifficult to work, and that the proposal could not beadopted until its feasibility had been examined by an inter-Departmental Com*ci11ee.The Cabinet agreed  To adhere to the decision they had taken on April 18th, that the proposal that imports of foreign potatoes should be permitted only under a general licence for special periods should not be accepted.

SECRET.(0,P, 581 (S3). )A P P E 23 D I X.5 -?* 0 lCOMMITTEE OH THE HISTORICAL SECTIONOP&apos;&quot;THE C6HHlTT^E 6tf iMPE^xhj^W&apos;ENC^E .REPORT.1*     The Committee was appointed on 28th December, 1922,with the following Terms of Reference(a) To oonsider and Report upon the work ofthe Historical Section of the Committeeof Imperial Defence:(b)   To make recommendations as to the con-tinuance or otherwise of the OfficialHistories of the War:(o)   Subject to a recommendation to continuethe Official Histories, to consider, inconsultation with the Heads of thoDepartments concerned, the selection ofauthors to fill any vaoancies:(d) To consider the question of publishingcertain sections of the History of theMinistry of Munitions.committee 2.CONTROLTHEICIALTORIES.During the enquiry by the Committee Into the working ofthe Historical Section of the Committee cf Imperial DefenceIt was pointed out that questions were liable to arise fromtime to time with regard to the Official Histories on whichIt was desirable for the Secretary to the Committee of Imperial.,Defence to obtain the ruling of a responsible Minister.     ^heCommittee which had been appointed in the past for this purpose is no longer able to discharge the requisite functions.The Committee recommend that a permanent Sub-Committee ofthe Committee of imperial Defence should be appointed to control the Official Histories, the membership of which to be a cabinet minister as Chairman, with representatives from the Treasury,- l -
Admiralty, War Office, Air Ministry end the Secretary totho Committee of Imperial Defence as members.S,     The Committee are satisfied that the OfficialHistories fulfil a useful purpose and that thsalrpreparation should be oontlnued.     Several of thesehistories, In particular the histories of the Militarycampaigns, are required for the education and Instructionof officers and consequently their preparation should notbe unduly delayed.With this object in view the Committee are of theopinion that additional historians should be appointed toundertake at once the preparation of the histories of theWestern Front, 1918, Palestine and Gallipoll campaigns.General Edmonds, the present Military Historian, shouldcontinue the completion of the History of the western front up to 1918, a work which will of necessity occupyhim for a considerable time.4.     Considerable difficulty has been experienced by theCommittee in selecting historians for these histories.The Committee, after consultation with the Secretary ofState for far and the First Lord of the Admiralty as regardsthe Military and Naval histories respectively, advise thatthe following gentlemen should be invited to undertake thework of writing the histories :-History of the Sir Henry Newbolt asNaval Operations:successor to the lateSir Julian Corbett.History of theWestern *&apos;ront, 1918:Lieut.General Sir L.E*Klggell, K.CB. , KoO oMoGoHistory of thePalestine Campaign:Major General Sir G.F.MacMunn, E.C.B., K.C.S.I.,D.S.O., on the terminationof his oresent appointment as C ,M,G. in India.History of the Gain pollCampaign.,Lieut,General Sir G.F.Ellison, K.O.B., K.C.M.G.
2 13 3Ijjiries 0?   5*     The Committee consider that a sum ef  $00 ptr annumshould, as a general rule, he sufficient remuneration tothe officers selected as historians, if they are also inreceipt of half or retired pay.     It is understood,however, that under tho regulations a reduction of 10j would he necessary in the amount to he paid to officers onthe active list in receipt of half pay.     The employmentof officers on half pay on these terms would he subjectto speoial Treasury and War Office sanction.In view of the high qualifications possessed by sir henry Hewbolt, who is suggested as successor to the lateSir Julian Corbett, the Committee recommend that he shouldreceive  1,000 par annum.PUBLICA- 6.     The advisability of ensuring that the cost of theSJ OS1 THEIPICIAL       Official Histories, particularly those required for theiSTORIES.education and training of officers, should be as low aspossible has been impressed on the Committee, and inconsequence the possibilities in this direction have been thoroughly explored.The Committee are of the opinion that this objectwill be best assured If B.U. Stationery Office undertakein the future the publication and sale of the Historiesof Military Operations, provided this can be arrangedwithout the payment of large sums by H.3i. Government ascompensation to the firms of Publishers with whom contractsare in existence at present.The remaining histories, i.e., the History of theAir Operations, Sea-borne Trade, T*ie Merchant Kavy In theWar, and The  aval Operations, differ from the Kil&amp;ttdryHistories in that they are net in the nature of textbooks, and are also, in several oases, in an advancedstate of completion.    The Committee therefore recommendthat the production of these histories should be left with the publishing iirma.7./&apos; 3 *
7.   An Interim Report, (CP. 66 (23)), on the question, of the publication of the History of the Ministry of ,Minitions was submitted to the Cabinet on 18thFebruary, 1923, and, for convenience of reference, isattached as an appendix to this P.eport.The Committee has given further consideration tothe proposal that a one-volume history of the -Ministryof l&amp;unitions should be prepared sumiiaricing the historyof that Department, aiid are of the opinion that theexpense involved in the preparation of this history wouldnot be justified.(Initialled on behalfof the Committee)S, F.

SJXOJ- 1SREX TO CF. 381(23) .flJP. 66 (23)COMMITTEE ON THE HISTORICAL SECTIONOF THECOMMITTEE Off IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Interim Report of tile History of the Ministryof Munitions.The Terms of Eeferenoe given to this Committee bythe Prime Minister on the 28th December, 1922, included:-(a) To consider the question sf publishingcertain sections of the History of theMinistry of Munitions.8.     The existing History of the Ministry of Munitions &apos;consists of twelve volumes, copies of which have been circulated to the various Government Departments.   Alimited number of copies of the various volumes are stillavailable, but not in sufficient numbers for sale to thePublic without re-printing.3.     It appeared to be advisable for us to consider andrepo-r   upon the question of this History without delay,as considerable cost to the Stationery Office is involvedin the storage of the type for these twelve volumes.4.     It has been pointed out to the Committee that Volumes9-12 contain highly secret matter, whioh it would boundesirable to issue to the Public.    The cost of the revision necessary before these volumes would be suitablefor issue-would be considerable.5.     The Committee arc of the opinion:-(a)   That the cost of re-printing the presentVolumes I to XII would not ba justified.fb)   That Sir Graham Greene should be authorisedto give instructions for the breaking up ofthe&apos;existing &quot;type&quot; of the History of theMinistry of Munitions;
(o)   Shat from the existing copies of this Historyh circulation should be made to the Admiralty,War Office, Air Ministry, Colonial Office andIndia Office for distribution to the DominionGovernments, Staff Colleges, etc;(d)   That any further copies remaining of VolumesI to VIII should be distributed to selectedInstitutes, Libraries, etc. in the UnitedKingdom.tthtd.)
