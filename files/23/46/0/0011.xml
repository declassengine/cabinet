-^^j/mc?a*. ^5..*.-...;:, ud/UUj i^iO j[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]^GERMANY. [July 20.]1 CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1.[C 12540/1/18] No. I.. t/ie Marquess Curzon of Kedleston to Count de Saint-Aulaire.*Your Excellency, Foreign Office, July 20, 1923.IT is now seven, weeks since the German Government, in their note of the7th June, submitted to the Powers fresh proposals for settling the problem of repara-tions. The main points in the note were three : (1) A proposal to submit to an impartial international tribunal the question of Germany&apos;s capacity to pay, coupled with an undertaking to accept any decision so reached as regards both the amount and the mode of payment ; (2) the assignment of certain specified guarantees assecurities for payment ; and (3) the summoning of a conference in order to work out a detailed scheme.His Majesty&apos;s Government were from the start of opinion that, whether theseproposals were adequate or not, they marked a sufficient advance to justify carefulconsideration with a view to the return of a collective reply. This view was concurred in by the Italian Government ; but the French and the Belgian Governments expressedthe view that, only after passive resistance had been definitely abandoned by Germany,would it be possible to enter into communication with her. In their anxiety toascertain the precise meaning to be attached to this condition a number of questions were addressed to the French and Belgian Governments by His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwith regard both to the action which the German Government was invited to take, andto the future position in the Ruhr,, if and when it should have been taken. the replies that have been returned to these questions have not completely lifted the veilof unceitainty in which the situation is still in parts involved.In the meantime, the question of reparations remains in suspense, and, whilereasons for inaction or for refusal to take any action but that which commends itself tothis or that Power abound, the international situation becomes weekly, and indeeddaily, more acute ; the occupation of the Ruhr, whether justified or not in itsconception, fails to produce the desired effect.; Allied unity is strained; payments byGermany on any adequate scale are not forthcoming. Moreover, the steady deterioration-tion of German currency renders it impracticable for her to meet her liabilities underthe Schedule of Payments fixed in May 1921. It may be that German policy hascontributed largely to create this situation. But it is with the results, even more than with the causes, that we are now concerned, and it is to these that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment venture to direct the attention of their allies.The view was put forward by His Majesty&apos;s Government at the Paris Conferencein January last, and is still held by them, that, in order to obtain from Germany thepayments which the Allies are entitled to receive, German credit must be re-established,German currency must be stabilised, the German budget must be balanced, and Germanproductivity must be encouraged. As long as the most highly developed area ofGerman industrial lite remains under military rule, and is made the scene of politicalagitation, it is difficult to see how the economic problem can be solved. It may bepossible to break Germany&apos;s power of resistance by such means ; but it will be at theprice of that very recovery upon which the Allied policy depends for its ultimatesuccess.If it be the case that the so-called passive resistance of Germany is the mainobstacle that stands in the way of that consummation, and if its abandonment will bethe first step towards a positive advance, Plis Majesty&apos;s Government are quite preparedto join their allies in pressing such a policy, as indeed they have already pressed it,upon the German Government, and in the proposed draft of a joint Allied reply to theGerman note of the 7th June, which they have the honour herewith to submit, theproposal has been definitely put forward. But if this plan is to be pursued with realhope of success, it would appear  that   two other  conditions will require to be* Also to Italian, Belgian and Japanese Ambassadors.[10363] B
simultaneously satisfied. The first is that a renewed and serious attempt should bemade to deal with the question of reparations by determining, not the liability ofGermany for that has already been laid down but her capacity to pay. The second is that proposals should be made for the restoration of the Ruhr to that condition which will enable it to become an area of fruitful production, rather than one ofinternational strife.As regards the first of these steps, it will be acknowledged that the reparationfigure laid down in 1921 no longer corresponds to the realities of the situation. Freshcalculations must sooner or later be made. It is in the best interest of the Alliesthat, whatever figure be finally decided upon by them, it should be accepted bythe German Government as just and realisable. Furthermore, the situation is likelynot to grow better, but to become worse, with delay. A recurrence lo procedure byultimatums may indeed produce tardy and reluctant capitulation ; but little satisfactionwill accrue if it fails to produce substantial deliveries either in cash or in kind.The German Government have proposed in their recent note to allow Germany&apos;capacity to pay, as well as the mode of payment, to be investigated by an impartialbody. Under article 234 of the Treaty of Versailles, a reduction of the total amountdeclared by the Reparation Commission to be payable by Germany can be made, ifexplicitly authorised by the several Governments represented on the commission.There is nothing to prevent those Governments, or the Reparation Commission onwhich they are represented, from calling into council such impartial and expert assist-ance as they may desire. Fortified by such authority, the Commission and the Govern-ments would be in a strong position to invite from the German Government, who underthe terms of the treaty would have a right to be heard, the fulfilment of theundertaking contained in the German note.As to the composition of such an enquiry, this is a matter which should bedetermined by the Allied Governments in consultation. There should be no difficultyin agreeing upon a selection of competent persons enjoying their confidence as well asthat of the public. Further, the advantage of American co-operation in this enquiry,whether in an official or in an unofficial capacity, scarcely requires emphasis, and is.confidently recommended by His Majesty&apos;s Government to their allies.Should His Majesty&apos;s Government be so fortunate as to carry with them the assent of their allies thus far, they will be ready without delay to enter into a more detailed discussion of the precise steps to be successively taken in order to carry out this plan of action. They only shrink from submitting more definite proposals nowbecause experience has shown that hard and fast schemes are apt to impede rather than to promote a general agreement.There remains the question, should the German Government accept the advicewith regard to cessation from passive resistance, which it is proposed to tender to them,of the future position in the Ruhr. His Majesty&apos;s Government believe that the Frenchand Belgian Governments will be the first to agree that the character of the occupationshould in those circumstances undergo a swift and material change; that the numbersof the. military forces stationed in the Ruhr and at other places occupied since Januarylast should be reduced as rapidly as possible; and that assurances of ultimate and complete evacuation, when the guarantees have been put into effective operation, shovjlrlnot be withheld. Simultaneously, the various measures that have been promulgatedin the name of the Rhineland Commission for coercing the civil population and impedingthe free movement of persons and goods would doubtless be either cancelled or relaxed;as generous an amnesty as possible would be accorded ; and the return of the expelledpopulation and functionaries would be facilitated under suitable guarantees.It has not been thought either necessary or desirable to include in the draft replyto the German Government the more precise indications which are contained in this despatch. Attaching, as they do, the highest importance to the maintenance of Alliedunity, and convinced that only by such unity will an early solution of the problem befound, His Majesty&apos;s Government have drawn up the draft reply in a spirit and in terms which they trust may be acceptable to their allies.They will, of course, be glad to consider any suggestions or emendations which any of the latter may think fit to propose consistently with the main lines of policywhich it has been the aim of His Majesty&apos;s Government to expound and to defend.Should the note meet with general favour, there would appear to be manifestadvantages in its -early despatch, and His Majesty&apos;s Government express the earnest (hop3 that there may be no delay in arriving at a decision on the subject.The^present communication, addressed to the Allies alone, has been added in orderto acquaint them in greater detail with the plans which His Majesty&apos;s Government
hope to be permitted to pursue iu conjunction with them, and which may be thus,&apos;resumed : 1. The German Government to undertake to abandon the policy of passive resistance.2. Steps to be taken upon the cessation of passive resistance for the resumption, ofthe civil administration of the Ruhr, and to provide for the progressiveevacuation of those areas.3. A body of impartial experts to be set up, charged with the duty of advising theAllied Governments and the Reparation Commission respectively as toGermany&apos;s capacity to pay, and as to the mode of payment to be prescribed.The co-operation of an American expert to be sought, and arrangements tobe made for German experts to be consulted and heard.4. The same body, or a body similarly constituted, to be asked to advise theReparation Commission as to the economic sureties and guarantees to bepledged by Germany to the Allies.5. Inter-Allied discussions to be opened with as little delay as possible, whether byconference or otherwise, for the purpose of elaborating a comprehensive plan of a general and final financial settlement.6. So soon as the economic sureties and guarantees which germany will havepledged to the Allies have been put into effective operation, the occupationof all. German territory outside the limits laid down in the Treaty ofVersailles to come to an end.His Majesty&apos;s Government venture to submit the foregoing proposals to their allies with the conviction that in the common interest positive action can no longersafely be delayed, and in the hope that they may help to facilitate a definite advance.His Majesty&apos;s Government have not dealt in - this note with the question of security, but they have already indicated their readiness to enter into sympathetic consideration of the subject whenever it may be thought desirable.CURZON OF KEDLESTON.Enclosure in No. 1.Draft Identic Reply to the German Government.ON the 2nd May the German Government addressed an identic note to theGovernments of the United States of America, Belgium, France, Great Britain, Italy,and Japan, containing certain proposals for a settlement of the question of reparations.To this note separate replies were returned by the French and Belgian Governments,acting in, unison, and by the Italian, British and Japanese Governments actingseparately. These replies concurred, however, in regarding the German proposals as unacceptable, the main criticism directed against them being that neither the totalamounts suggested as payable for reparation, nor the mode of payment, nor the guarantees offered, were at all adequate, while settlement of any kind was madecontingent on the evacuation of the Ruhr, pending which passive resistance by theGermans was not to be renounced. ...The unfavourable reception accorded to these proposals having led the GermanGovernment to reconsider its attitude, that Government on the 7th June addressed asecond communication to the same Powers.In this memorandum, the German Government, affirming once again itsdetermina-tion to discharge its reparation debt, repeated a proposal which it had before made, torefer to an impartial international tribunal the question both of the amount and themethods of payment, undertook to furnish such a body with all possible information and assistance in conducting the investigation, and promised to accept the decision atwhich it might arrive. Further, the German Government proposed certain guaranteesor sureties for the regular payment of the liabilities thus fixed, involving, however, thegrant of a moratorium of four years from the present date.. Finally, the German Government suggested a conference at which Germany mightbe assisted by oral discussion in arriving at a solution of all these questions.The German note did not, on this occasion, contain any reference to the subject ofpassive resistance, not, it is presumed, from any failure to appreciate its peculiar[10363] B 2
importance, but because that topic had riot been mentioned in all of the replies of theAllied Governments to which the note was intended as an answer.The Allied Governments, anxious to terminate the phase equally of papevcontroversy and of international complication, will now give their views upon each ofthese matters.In the Treaty of Versailles it was recognised by the Allied and associated governments that, while affirming the full responsibility of Germany for all the loss and damage which they had suffered at her hands during the war, they could not, inview of her diminished resources, expect to receive from her complete reparation for all such loss and damage. In other words, the necessity was admitted, even at that dateof adjusting the liability of Germany to her capacity to pay.In May 1921 the amount of reparation was fixed by the Reparation commission at 132 milliards of gold marks. No power was given by the treaty to cancel any partof that obligation, except with the specific authority of the several governments represented on the commission. If, therefore, the contention is now put forward that,owing to the altered circumstances of to-day, the figure of 1921 is too high and calls for reduction, it can only be by action within the framework of the treaty that such reduction can properly be made ; and it is only from this point of view that the AlliedPowers are free to consider the first request of the German Government in the notenow under reply, namely, the request for an examination by an impartial international tribunal of Germany&apos;s present capacity for payment.The Allied Governments, while unable to accede to this request in the form inwhich it was proposed, are far from thinking that they might not be assisted in thetask devolved upon them by the treaty by the labours of competent and impartialexperts; and provided that nothing is done in this respect that is inconsistent with thetreaty stipulations, they are disposed to think that positive advantage might result from such an examination. It would bring the allegations of diminished capacity tothe test of fact ; it would reveal the actual position at the present moment; and itwould remove all excuse for evasion.The Allied Governments take note of the statement by the German Governmentthat it would welcome such an enquiry, and of its pledge to abide by the result.If a binding arrangement were entered into, concerning the discharge of the entireliability, as thus determined, and as to the guarantees or sureties to be taken for theregular and complete payment of the total debt, the whole problem would assume adifferent aspect.As to the guarantees or sureties, themselves, the Allied Governments, whileappreciating the effort of the German Government to advance beyond the vagueindications of the earlier note of the 2nd May, must guard themselves from acceptingthese new proposals as adequately, or in the best possible way, meeting the actualrequirements of the situation. Their economic value must largely depend upon iactorsof which no mention is made in the German note, such as the stabilisation of the markand the balancing of the German budget. A careful examination of these, or other,supplementary guarantees will be an inseparable feature of the enquiry which the,Allied Governments are prepared within the limits of the treaty to initiate.It must be clear, however, that no guarantees for the punctual discharge ufaccepted liabilities will suffice, unless provision is at the same time made for some formof international control of. German financial administration. This is one of the subjects to which it will be necessary to invite the serious attention of the German Government,and without a settlement of which no final solution can be obtained.When the German Government asks for oral discussion of all these matters, it maybe remembered that, under the treaty, the Reparation Commission, while authorisedfrom time to time to consider the resources and capacity of Germany, is also under an obligation &quot; to give to the German Government an opportunity to be heard.&quot; Thiswill allow for free consultation with the latter, and will enable it to make a fullpresentation of the German case.Such is the reply of the Allied Governments to the main propositions of theGerman note. There remains, however, one important consideration which is theantecedent condition to a willingness on the part of the Allies to reopen the questions to which reference has been made. The occupation of the Ruhr valley by the armed forces of certain of the Allies has been followed by measures deliberately taken by theGerman Government to impede this policy and to delay the payment of reparations, fThese measures may be summed up in the familiar phrase &quot; passive resistance.&quot; If ^German Government now desires a resumption of enquiry, it will, in the opinion othe Allied Governments, be well advised to withdraw without further delay tQe
ordinances and decrees which have organised and fomented this form of resistance, andtj openly and unequivocally to disavow the acts of violence and sabotage which have insome cases accompanied it.Were this action to be taken without delay, not only would it be regarded as anevidence of that good faith which the German Government has once again avowed, butit would involve a reconsideration by the occupying Powers of the conditions of their occupation and a gradual return to the normal features of industrial life in the Ruhr.Such a reversion would possess the additional advantage that, by re-establishing the productive activity of that region, it would enable the German Government morespeedily and more effectively to discharge its reparation debt.In making this reply to the German note, the Allied Governments have clearlydemonstrated their earnest desire for the cessation of conflict and the pacification ofEurope. In return they feel that they have the right to invite the co-operation of theGerman Government in the execution of this policy ; and they have indicated withas much precision as is possible at the present stage the reciprocal steps by which each party can effectively contribute to the desired result.
