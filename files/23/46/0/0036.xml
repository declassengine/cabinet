The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave theCabinet a full summary of the events leading up to thepresent position in the Palatinate and the deplorabledifference which had arisen between this country andFrance on the subject.    He began with an account of thedevelopment of the Separatist movement under Frenchauspices as part of a consistent policy aiming at the separation of the Rhineland from Germany and the creationof a separate State under French influence, first, in thenorthern part of the Rhineland, where the movemept haddefinitely failed, and, more recently, in the Palatinate.Lord Curson explained the circumstances in which, notwith-standing French objections, he had deemed it necessary tosend the British Consul-General at Munich to investigateconditions in the Palatinate, where the French had insisted on attaching an official to the Consul-General.   He furtherexplained the position which had arisen, on the Rhine landHigh Commission, where the French/High CommissioiierSwishedto register the decrees issued by the so-called SeparatistGovernment in the Palatinate, while the British HighCorals si oner had   had to&apos; withhold, his
assent to-&quot;any-action- which,would imply recognition of theon the pround that this, would he ultra vires,de facto Separatist Government/   The investilgntrlculsninder-taken in the Foreign Office showed that the legal position. taken up by Lord Kilmarnock was irrefutable.The Cabinet agreed with the advice of the secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that it would be inadvisablein any event to withdraw our High. Commissioner, since thiswould be a departure from dispositions resulting from theTreaty of Versailles , would give the French a free handin the rhineland, and deprive us of all knowledge of-whatwas going on there.   While taking note of the possibilityof referring to the Hague Court the question of the rightsof the Rhineland Commission in regard to any Separatistmovement In the Rhineland, they agreed that, in present political conditions, no action should be taken to put pressure on the French Government.   More&apos; particularly,however, in view of the large loans which France is making,to Czecho--Slovakia and other countries in Central and eastern Europe, the Cabinet welcomed the suggestion made bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, with theconcurrence of the Chancellor of the Exchequer  That the Chancellor of the Exchequer should circulate to the Cabinet the reply which hehad sent to the Foreign Office to an enquiry as to the practicability and desirability of raising the question of the payment of inter-est by the French Government on their war debt to this country.
$GLO-PERSIAN      2. The Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandum byOIL COMPANY.the First Lord of the Admiralty on the subject of a(previous proposal that the Government should sell their holdingReference:Cabinet 4 In the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and that the latter should(24) , Con- ,elusion 10.)   be merged in a group composed of the Royal Dutch? Shellana Burmah Companies (Paper CP.-20 (24)).Ihe President of the Board of Trade, who had under-stood that this question. would not be discussed In detail?gave a short summary of some of the main grounds on whichthe merger scheme was advocated. &apos; The Anglo-Persian company had&apos;engaged in a huge organisation for selling oil.    If theCompany was to carry on this organisation it would probably have to increase its capital? perhaps to  20,000,000.    Underthe present scheme the Government were offered  4 per  1share.-   If the Anglo-Persian&apos; Company were obliged to increase its capital, he was advised that there might be a substan-tial fall in the value of the shares,- and, further, theGovernment might have to go to Parliament in order&quot; to askfor fresh capital to buy out the Burmah Company.   If this occurred, it would be difficult to explain in Parliamentwiry the Government had refused the favourable offer now madefor the purchase of their shares.In view of the important strategical reasons given bythe First Lord of the Admiralty in his Memorandum, andhaving regard to the fact that the question had not beenconsidered by the Committee- of - Imperial- Defence, the cabinet agreed(a)&apos;That they would not be justified in-taking a decision on more exhaustivat the momentso. so large a question withoutIve enquiry than was possible(b) That in reply to Parliamentary questions on the subject the answer should be that inJune, 1922, the&apos; question had been examined by a Committee? whose Report had-been adverseto the proposals for the sale of the G-overn-ments shares and the merging of the Anglo-Persian Company with other Companies;   that &apos;
the question had since &quot;been raised again,but that the Government had not had timeto investigate the matter themselves;their intention, if they remained in office, would-be to refer the matter tothe same Committee as had previouslyexamined the question.
ii Q 9lX U wIritish dybs.deviousreference:&apos; linet 424) j Oon-conclusion 11.)3.   The Cabinet had before them the following documents in regard to British Dyes:-A Memorandum &quot;by the President of theBoard of Trade , covering a draft agreement between the British dyestuffs corporation and the German InteressenGemeinschaft (Paper CP.-23 (24)JA Memorandum by the First Lord of theAdmiralty urging the rejection of theAgreement as contrary to national policy(Paper CP.-26 (24)).In the course of the discussion it transpired thatthe technical status of the British Government in thematter was that of holder of a large number of shares, with two Directors on the Board.    They were therefore in aposition to exercise great influence on the conclusion ofany agreement. Hitherto, under successive Governments,this influence had been exercised in favour of an agreementwith the German interests.In the course of the discussion it was argued thatthere would be a conflict between the national objects forwhich the British Government had during the War helped topromote the British Dyestuffs Corporation and subsequentlysupported it, and the commercial interests on which thevery existence of the Corporation depended.    It was urgedthat if the proposed Agreement was concluded, the greaterpart of the research would be undertaken by German chemists;the new fashions resulting from the new discoveries (whichwere the most profitable part of the dye industry), wouldbe started by the German Company, which would put down the plant for their development;   it was probable that, insteadof laying down fresh plant, the British Company would exercise its option of buying those new discoveries at cost price from the German   Company, and would tend to becomemere selling agents in all the more progressive departments of the industry.    Thus the British industry would tend tostagnate and the nation would not obtain a progressive-5-
dyeing industry, an up-to-date plant, and a corps of re-search chemists, which the War had shorm to he so necessaryfor the development of poison gases, explosives, etc.On the other...hand it was contended that the industry could not become;, as&apos; efficient as the German industry withoutGerman cor-operation for many years, and that this policy had been consistently pursued by every supporter of theindustry.It was generally accepted that if the proposed Agree-ment was not concluded, there was every prospect that the licensing Committee would refuse to work the Dyes Act, theAct would become inoperative, and, in the absence of aprohibitive Government subvention, the British Dyes Corpora-tion would be voluntarily wound up.    In this event thenational advantages which it had been hoped to obtain fromthe establishment of the British Dyes Corporation would be wholly lost.The Cabinet were informed that the Treasur:/, whilstapproving,the Agreement as the, least disadvantageous course in the circumstances, felt that the Government ought to  .receive the same treatment as othershareholders.The Cabinet agreed  -(a) That, in view of the conflicting interests involved, the Government we re&apos;.not in aposition to reach a final decision withoutfurther enquiry, which, in the present political situation, they were not in aposition to undertake:(b) That, in the event of a change of Govern-ment, it should be an instruction to theSecretary to bring the matter before thenew Government as one of the greatesturgency:(c) That in the meantime the President of theBoard of Trade should instruct his Departmentto continue negotiations with the Colour usersin regard to certain difficulties which theyhad raised in repard to the proposed Agreement.

The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the agreement reached betweenthe Chancellor of the Exchequer and theFirst Lord of the Admiralty that a sum of 5,000,000 for the oonotruotion of oruioorssbould be included in the Naval Estimates:J(b) That the form of the statement to be made inthe House of Commons on the subject by theFirst Lord of the Admiralty, more partiou-larly in regard to any mention of the numberof cruisers to be laid down., should bearranged between the Chancellor of theExchequer and the First Lord of the Admiralty
THE INDUS-TRIALgfTOATION.Threatened.Strike ofLocomotiveEngineers.(previous reference: -Cabinet 42(23) , Con-conclusion 1.)5.    The Cabinet were informed by the Minister of labour that Mr Arthur Henderson was still engaged in negotiationswith a view to averting the threatened strike of locomotive engineers.The Secretary of State for Home Affairs informed his colleagues that some preparations for a possible strike had been made, but that it was very important to postpone the issue of any Proclamation to the last possible moment,since such a Proclamation was only valid for a week, at theend of which it would expire unless renewed by the authorityof Parliament.
