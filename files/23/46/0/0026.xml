In view ofthe difficulty of carrying on with a Parliament that knewit was shortly to come to an end, and in order to curtailthe dislocation of commercial business, etc., which mustin any event prevail until the General Election was over,he had decided that the Election should take place withthe minimum of delay.The Cabinet were informed that, unless the Workmen&apos;-compensation Bill were passed, the war legislation on thesubject would expire at the end of the present year, withthe result that workmen&apos;s compensation would be reduced toabout half the present rate.    An understanding had beenreached with the Labour Party, in the previous August, thatBillthis /should be postponed until after the Recess, on the
condition that the first two days of Parliamentary time were to be devoted to it on re-assembly.   Mr RamsayMacDonaldj the leader of the Labour Party, had undertakenthat the Labour Party would permit the passage of the Billin Parliament on Wednesday night.    The House of Lords might then be asked, in the special circumstances of the case, topass the-Bill through all its stages on Thursday.After some discussion it was agreed  (a) That, notwithstanding the possibility that the Liberal Parties in the Houseof Commons might delay the passage ofthe Workmen&apos;s &quot;Compensation Bill by pro-posing to raise the rate of compensationhigher than was provided by the Bill, orin other ways, the plan of proceeding withthe Bill was preferable to the alternative of providing for the continuance of work-men&quot; s compensation on the present scaleby means of a one-clause Bill to includethe present compensation in the expiring laws Continuance Act, which would giverise to even greater Parliamentary diffi-culties:(b) That the Prime Minister in the House ofCommons, and the Secretary of Ste,te forForeign Affairs in the House of Lords,should make an announcement the same after-noon to the following effect:-(i) That the Prime Minister had advised the King to dissolve Parliament assoon as possible:(ii) That the House of Commons wouldbe asked to pass the Workmen&apos;s Oom-pensation Bill on Wednesday, November14th, and   the House of Lords on Thursday,November 15th:(iii) That Thursday would be allotted in theHouse of Commons to the moving of a vote of Censure by the leader&quot;of theLabour Party:(iv) That the prorogation would take placeon Friday, November 16th, to be followedby dissolution the same day.
KING!S 2o The Prime minister asked his colleagues to oommuni]0H.cate any suggestions they had to make in regard to theKing&apos;s Speech to the Secretary of the Cabinet at theearliest possible moment. .-3-
ICY.previous conference:linet 533), Con-conclusion 7.;3.  The Cabinet bad before them the following documents relating to Agricultural Policy:-(i) The Report of the Cabinet Committee(Paper Co P.-456 (23)).(ii) The Second Interim Report of theAgricultural Tribunal of Investi-gation (Paper CP.-457 (23) ).No dissent was expressed from the principle ofsome form of subsidy to Agriculture to compensate for theprotection it was proposed to give to industry by meansCustomsof a/Tariff.Tiib discussion was narrowed to a consideration ofthe form in which the policy should be presented at thepresent time , on which the following alternatives were proposed:-(i) To make a full statement of policy beforethe rising of Parliament, on the general lines of the recommendations of theCabinet Committee, including some state-ment in regard to wages, on which theCabinet Committee had presented twoalte-natives:or -(ii) To adopt the same policy as in the case ofthe Industrial part of the Economic Pro-gramme, that is to say, to appeal to the electorate not on a detailed agricultural programme, but on some very general policy,such as a statement to the effect that a subsidy would be given, that the labourerwould have a minimum wage, and that provision would be made against any unfair raising of rent.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To meet again on the following day to decide the nature of the announcement&apos; to be made inregard to Agricultural Policy:(b) That the question of applying the subsidy to Malting Barley and Hops should beconsidered at the Cabinet on the following day:(c) That the Prims Minister should decide whether the Letter from the national farmers&apos; Union (contained in Paper CP. -442 (23)) and the Second Interim Report
cl O 4of the Agricultural Tribunal of Invest!-gatlon should bo published:(d) That the Minister of Education should communicate with the Prime minister in regard to the preoccupation of farmers in&apos;the neighbourhood of his constituency and elsewhere lest certain commodities used in farming should beincluded in a Customs Tariff.-5-
IaROBQUaKE     4. The Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandum bythe Foreign Office proposing that Parliament should be askedroutslance&apos;:let 47( Con-n b *;to place on record its sympathy with the Government and people of Japan, and at the same time to vote  100,000 tothe relief of sufferers (Paper Co P.-450 (23)).The Cabinet were informed that, in view of theforthcoming prorogation, it would not be practicable toobtain a vote of money from Parliament.After some discussion, the Cabinet agreed  That purchases should be made,to the valueof  100,000, of articles selected from the list of requirements furnished by theJapanese Government, and should be forwarded to Japan as a gift from the British Govern-ment *
mm5. In connection with the question of Unemployment, theattention of tlie Cabinet was drawn to Telegrams Nos. 536 ,pposedJstraotionf submarines.537 and 538, of November 9th, 1923, from the British Minis- feet on Un- ter at Athens, to the effect that the Greek Government wasmployment..Ifsvioussferenee:cabinet 5023), Oon-conclusion   4.)about to embark on a comprehensive programme of naval construction, including ten Destroyers and sixteen Sub-marines;   that the Greek Government would have preferred to give the whole of the work to a British firm, and had at one time virtually decided to allot the&apos; greater partof the programme to British - firms by competitive tender,but that the French had offered, If the whole of thesubmarine programme were given to them, to finance it byreopening the credits granted in February, 1918. Oonse-quently there was every prospect of this contract, whichwas worth about  5,000,000, going to France and not toGreat Britain.The Cabinet arreed  (a) That, at a time when the Greek Governmenttrw     owed about $1,000,006 to the BritishGovernment, and when limitation of arma-ments was one of the greatest needs of theworld, it was deplorable that Greece shouldembark on any naval programme:(b) That the Secretary of State Lor ForeignAffairs should therefore do his utmost to prevent the contemplated expenditure by Greece, but that if, notwithstandinghis efforts, this money was to be spent,the contract should, if possible, beobtained in this country.
k3 t3 J6.    The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs askedor an early opportunity to raise a number of importantssues on Foreign Affairs at the CabinetaThe Cabinet agreed  That the questions should be discussed on the following day.
ieish oom-pbnsationaid landpurchase.(previous reference:Cabinet 36(23), Con-conclusion 2.)7.  The Lord President of the Council, referring to ameeting of the Irish Committee which had &quot;been held on theprevious evening, made a statement to the Cabinet inregard to the treatment of Irish Loyalists in connectionwith land purchase and post-truce compensation.   he pointed out that. In view of the forthcoming dissolution of Parliament, it would be impossible for the Governmentto implement in the present Session the promises whichhad been given to the Irish Loyalists.    In these circum-stances he asked the Cabinet to adopt one of the followingalt e rnatives:-(i) To make a public announcement of their intention to carry out all pledges ifre-elected:or, if this were inadvisable,(ii) To place on record in the most formalmanner, as the view of the Cabinet, thatthe guarantee of the bonds issued by.    the Irish Free State in respect of landpurchase, was regarded by them as an obligation of honour.The Cabinet agreed  To discuss the question on the following day, when the Report of the Committee onIrish Affairs would be available.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer asked all membersof the Cabinet to take note that, in view of the&apos; present financial position of the country, the adoption of a systemof Tariffs must not he expeoted to raise a revenue whichwould permit of any considerable remission of other formsof taxation, or fresh expenditure being incurred.    He was at present advised that there was a prospect of a largedeficit on. the next year5 s Budget.    If  lljOOO,000 wereallotted as a subsidy to Agriculture, and another large sum to the- stimulation of cot ton-growing in the British Empire,not much would be left from the produce of the new importtariffs*-10-
