/ / /   /  ?m* f * 4**&quot;Revise)GOTAff REPARATION.Statement to be read in both Houses of Parliament onJuly 12th, 1923.(As approved at meeting of Cabinet held at IToon, onJuly 12th, 1923.)It cannot be made too clear in the interestsalike of the Powers concerned and of any who may hope to profit by exploiting differences between them, thatthe sole ground of possible divergence is as to themost effectively%re moans of reaching the ends which arevital to all an&amp; upon which all are in agreement.These ends are,as they have remained throughout, *the payment of reparations and the recovered securityof Europe.       To ei^ure these the Allies have grudgednothing in the past nor will they grudge anything in the future.     This responsibility is acknowledgedand is shared in equal measure by Prance, by Italy,by Belgium and by ourselves.     Perhaps it maybe held to devolve in a more special measureupon the French and British Nations by virtue ofthe great sacrifices which they made side by side in the years of tria-i, by the intimacy of
fact -and^neraory^ d;-o&amp;ayand vxg&amp; least by the experience which thesetwo ancient civilisat ions have sharedthroughout the centuries&apos;.     A similarcommunity of thought and action ,binds usin the present emergency to our other allies, whose interests are in no respectdivergent from our own.     In the commondesire for settlement&apos; and pacification,and still more for no further or unreasonabledelay,, we can speak together frankly and&quot;with the full comprehension of partnersboUnd by an equal destiny to the same task.   The%/b.ispers of interested parties cannot beallowed on either side of the Channel or inany part of Europe to deflect us from thatduty by any reservations, or by carefullyfostered mi sunderstandings.In all that we are about to say orto do His Majesty1s Government are moved,as we know the heart of France to be moved, and the same applies equally to our other allies,&quot;by the single desire that good-$will between the Nations who have enduredtogether shall be maintained and that eachshall obtain what is her due.
We &apos;,i*e as determined&quot; as any of our Allies thatGermany shall make reparation for the damages done inthe Great War up to the fullest extent of her capacity..We have never wavered on this point, I do not believethat our people ever will.Indeed we go further, and we are ready as we have said cn many occasions and as was repeated at Paris inJanuary last, to use every measure to compel Germany topay up to the amount of her capacity.We are conscious however as a business, nation that ifwe ask Germany to pay in excess of her capacity we shallnot succeed.     We and our Allies will be the main sufferersand we are firmly convinced that methods which can only result in the ruin of Germany will be ol^s^^ks to thiscountry, to our Allies and t,o the whole of Europe.From the beginning we have made it clear that In ouropinion the occupation of the Ruhr was not calculated toproduce the maximum amount of reparation garment forthe Allies.     In January we made in Paris an offer whichwe regarded as a very generous settlement in order toavoid what seemed to us to be an economic disaster.That offer was rejected by our Allies and since then wehave stood aside animated by a spirit of sincere loyalty to the Alliance which has been and continues to be in ouropinion the main security for European Peace.      Many ofthe consequences which were then anticipated are in courseof fulfilment.     The Allies are obtaining less reparationthan they did before the occupation.     What reparationthey are obtain&amp;a4ng is^/being exacted at the price of the growing dislocation of the German economic system, and asseems probable of the future total collapse of that system itself./
The French and Belgian -Governments as sure us thattheir sole object in occupying the Ruhr is to securethepayment of reparations. .   If that be so thedifference,between us is one of method rather than of aim, but we are convinced that an indefinite con-tlnuation of this state of affairs is fraught with grave peril.     Germany herself appears to be movingfast towards economic chaos, which may itself besucceeded by social and industrial ruin.     The localpopulations are in many cases suffering severely,and there are f$&amp;&amp;4s&amp;&amp;&amp;&apos; apprehensions of a shortageof food.     Nor is this a situation that concernsGermany alone.     In proportion as the productivepower&apos; of that country is exhausted, so does the recovery of her credit and the payment of her debtsrecede into a dimmer distance.     Every country inEurope is ,paying the price for this condition ofaffairs.      One country pays it in a steadilyfalling exchange, another in diminished trade, a third in increasing unemployment.     If we wercalled upon to state or to defend the case of our -own country alone, we could without difficulty demonstrate serious effect that has already been producedupon British trade.In spite of very great expenditure by the State(the figure is some  400 millions sterling since theArmistice) we still have unemployment on a large scale in this country.     Not only does our devastationcontinue instead of being repaired^ but It continuesincreasingly as the moral effects spread among our people.Public....
.    120Public opinion throughout Europe, and not least in Great Britain, is becoming more and moresensitive to these conditions and alarmed at theiroontinuance.     It is not too much to say that the recovery of the world is in danger, and that peace,for which so many sacrifices were borne, Is at stake.It is in these ciroumstknees that the necessityfor action has been increasingly impressed upon his Majesty&apos;e Government.     The exchange of friendlyconversations^ useful as they are, does not appearto lead in all caaes- to positive results.     It is becoming evident that the attitude of the principalparties concerned must be more clearly&quot;defined.If the situation has been at all correctlydescribed
described in the preceding paragraphs, itcannot be left to right ItoolfJP   There willI believe be general agreement&apos; to these proposi-tions - that the period of conflict should assoon as possible be terminated;      that the indefinite occupation by one country ofthe territory of another in time of peace is aphenomenon, rare and regrettable in itself tot/hich an honourable end should as soon aspossible be found&apos;;    that the debtor should notmerely be called upon to pay his debts but should be placed in a position where he can doso;     that his capacity, where it is in doubt,  should be tested and determined, andthat united efforts should be. made to accomplishthese qxi&amp;sSrecovery will not be ensured until a solutionhas been found to three great  questions.They are (l) the payment&apos; of reparations,  (2) thesettlement of interallied debts, and (3) thesecurity of a pacified Europe.      It is to thesequestions that the attention of the world shouldbe turned.In the pursuit of these aims His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are so far from desiring to. deprivePrance and Belgium of their legal claims that they wish to assist them In their realisationPeace will not finally be obtained and/Our desire/
19 9-s-  ^Our desire is for advance, if it can &quot;be made andfor finality if it oan be attained.     And. in theseaspirations as well as in our view of the generalsituation, we are hopeful of obtaining the concurrence of France and Belgium, no leas than that of Italy.     Indeed,we have every reason to believe that the views of theItalian Government are in substantial agreement with our&apos; own,What then are the steps which -we think ought to betaken?     The German note of June 7 th, in reply to adefinite suggestion which had been addressed to theGerman Government, proposed an investigation of Germany&apos;capacity to pay by an impartial body, coupled with an engagement to pay the amounts determined in the manner thatmight be proposed.It-further contained the offer of a series ofconcrete guarantees.     We do not think that these suggestions, whether they be adequate or not, should be ignored.     We are unable t$ agree that a correspondenceof this nature upon matters affecting the interests ofall whould be wholly one-sided, or that proposals, whichmay be found to contain in them the germs of a possiblesettlement should be treated with indifferenoe.We hold that they should be examined&apos;and explored inorder that we may discover whether there lies withinthem the possibility of progress.     Understanding thatthe French and Belgian Go&quot;vernmenta are not disposed totake the Initiative in suggesting a reply - although we v/ould. .
we would gladly have welcomed any such action ontheir part - we have informed those Governments as also the Italian Government, that we are willingto assume the responsibility of preparing a draft reply ourselves.     Adhering however as we do tothe vie?; which we expressed on the last occasionthat united action is better than separate orisolated action, we shall submit the reply withthe least possible delay to our allies, for their consideration and remarks, and we indulge in thehope that we may be able to arrive at.an agreementwith them as to the terms.What the exact nature of the reply should be itwill be premature to discuss at the present stage.In formulating these views, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are not without hope that they may beexpressing Allied sentiments as well as their own.We do not believe that in principle we are widelyseparated, if at all, from themc     Divergence ofmethod.should not be incapable of resolution^So far as united action is possible, we shall continue to -^e-i^e^i^-it, as we have endeavoured to do all along, and we shall confidently invitethe sympathetic consideration of the whole of our allies and of all interested States to proposalswhich will have no other aim than the pacificationof Europe and the recovery of an exhausted world.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.12th July, 1923,.
