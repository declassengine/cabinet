The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave theCabinet a full account of conversations he had held on theprevious afternoon., first with the Belgian and then with -the French Ambassador, in the course of which the Ambassadors-dors had given verbally an outline of the attitude of theirrespective Governments on the questions which had been addressed to their by Lord Curao-n on the subject of theGerman Note of June 7th.    The Belgian Ambassador had alsocommunicated an informal Aide-remoire.    The replies- of theBelgian Government to the questions addressed to. then.] byLord Gurzon had been extremely vague,  and the foreign secretary had, had to ask for greater precision.   -The verbalrep..of the French Ambassador-had been so long,  detailed and diffuse as not to lend itself to&apos; reproduction from,memory with the precision&apos;necessary in so important a matter,and Lord Gurzon had&apos; pressed for a written communication.The- -general tenor of the verbal reply, however,- had, beenunsatisfactory, and Lord Gurzon had made it clear&apos; to the ambassador., that.,, within the . -few wee ha intervening before&apos;the Parliamentary Recess,, it would be necessary for -HisMajesty&apos;s Government to; respond to the ever-growing public demand for the formulation of a definite policy in regardto reparations   and that British public, opinion was not
likely to support H,Poincard1s polioy of Merely demand-I ing that Germany should abandon passive resistance in the Ruhr and throw herself on the mercy of france and  Belgium without any guarantees for the future,fhe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs intimatedhis intention of circulating an account of bothc onversations.After a short discussion as to the policy to be pursued in the event of the further replies of theFrench and Belgian Governments proving unsatisfactory,in the course of which evidence was given as to the increasing demand of public opinion for a settlementof the reparations problem^ the Cabinet agreedfa) That, before taking further action,the further replies of the Frencfa and belgian Governments must be awaited.(b) That the President of the Board of trade should circulate to the Cabinet the opinions expressed to him at his monthlymeeting by bankers and representativesof trade and industry regarding thepresent position and prospects-of british trade and industry, and the effect ofthe present imposed processes in the question of reparations .Tr&quot;&apos;

India in regardto the reduction of Cavalry Regiments, aswell as an earlier Memorandum by&apos;, the Secretaryof State for War on the whole question (paper c.P^-217(S3)) .The Secretary of State for India made a comprehensive statement in support of the proposed reductions, in thecourse of which he described In detail the following aspects-of the question:-^- The difficult financial situation of theCentral and Provincial Governments in India;    the marked improvement during the last fifteen months in the externalsituation of India,, both as regards Afghanistan and the IndianFrontier^ as well as in the internal situation.    Lord Peelasked the Cabinet to take note that, although the Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence on-indian military Requirements had recommended that &quot;no further reduction of the- armed forces of the Crown,- whether Briti&amp;hor Indian, was Immediately ..possible&quot; (C .1       Paper 13Q-D,para.105), they had recommended in the preceding paragraphthat &quot;the Secretary of State for India should carefullyreview these establishments, and they should pursue everyline of enquiry with the object of making further economies.in military expenditure&quot;^ (para.104). . The Sub-Committeehad also In&amp;Tuded in their Report the following:-    &quot;and itis reoogri&amp;s-ed that, a point may..-be. reached in any country

C A. B I N E T .. &apos; CO^MITTnB Oil UMEM PLOYFLNT .Interim Report.It. Int roductory.On consideration of the available information and-particularly of papers circulated by-the Chairman (CP.276  (23)) and the Minister of Labour (CP. 268 (23)) it Is clear to the Corrm.ittee that it must be contemplated that the coming winter will be marked by a serious degree of unemployment, andthat the Government must be prepared to provide assistance towardsthe initiation or acceleration of works on a scale at least as great as w?.s undertaken in the past &quot;financial year.(2) The Committee is - proceeding to review and will shortlyreport upon the whole position.including the extent to whichassistance is -still available under existing schemes, the extent .to which Government contracts can be accelerated, and the extentto which local authorities are able and willing to submit new schemes for assisted- work under the terms of the offer approved bythe. Cabinet in April last (Cabinet 21  (23)) .II. Ac ce 1 e r at ion of Works cf Local Authorities.(3) Many of the industries of tho Country are and have been seriously depressed for a long time, but it Is in the heavy4? Engineering and Shipbuilding- and allied trades that the depressionhas been most marked, and the prospects of recovery through ordinarytrade improvement are most obscure. ,
(4) The relief work ordinarily provided by localauthorities can be of but little assistance to the skilledemployees of these industries, and it is of vital importanceto the country that the Industrial asset of their skillshould be available, as little Impaired as practicable, tomeet the improvement in trade when it comes.     Moreover thelocal authorities in the most distressed areas have alreadyincurred heavy expenditure in the provision of relief works,aid it is becoming increasingly difficult for them to take further action of this kind.(5) In these circumstances It appears to the Committeethat the problem of unemployment in such industries cannotbe adequately met by local relief works.     Its solution mustlargely depend upon the stimulation of orders for material,(G) The Committee accordingly recomnend that a furtheroffer of assistance by way of grant should be made to localauthorities who are willing to undertake works which will notbe entirely directed to the benefit of the unemployed intheir own areasr, but will assist In producing employment ofa normal character in the depressed industries, alreadyment ioned.(7) The terms of grant already off erred (see C .P. (21).(23))through the Unemployment Grants Committee for works in thecoming winter1^ programme are as f ollows :-&apos;&quot;^* Capital works financed by loan,(a) Revenue Producing Schemes.Grants eqiial to 50 per cent, of the interest on loans raised bjr Local Authorities for a period ofnot less then ten years, in respect of expenditure on approved schemes, will be paid by the State for a periodof five years *
(b) Schemes for work undertaken in connection with or as part of a revenue producing undertaking which, in the view of the competent department,will not themselves directly produce revenue or are not likely to produce revenue for a oon-s id enable number of years.Grants equal to 50 per cent. Of the Interest.  on loans raised for a period of not leag than ten years,in respect of expenditure on approved schemes, will bepaid by the State for s period of fifteen years or forthe period of the loan, whichever is the leas,(c) Non-Revenue Producing Schemes.Grants equal to 65 per cent, of the Interestand sinking fund charges on loans raised to meet expenditure on approved schemes will be paid by theState for a period of one-half the terra of the loan,subject to a maximum of fifteen years..II. Work?L financed, otherwise, than by Loan.Grants will be paid by the State on the basisof 60 per cent, of the wages bill for unemployed mentaken on for the work&quot;.(8) The recommend a tlon of the Committee is that theabove terms should be improved by the offer of grants onthe scale applied, to the class of works described under 1(b)in paragraph 7. for works on revenue producing schemes whichwill assist unemployment generally by the placing of substantial orders in the depressed industries in additionto the development of capital works in the particularlocality concerned.&apos;(9) A draft circular to be issued If approved, by theUnemployment Grants Committee is appended.   If the policynow recommended is adopted, it is necessary that Its adoption
should be made public at the earliest possible moment, sothat the results of the circular, in securing the submission of schemes may be approximately ascertainedbefore the end of July; and &quot;included In the general reviewof the position which it will be necessary to submit to theCabinet.(10) The Committee further reoomraend tha t theUnemployment Grants Committee be authorised to use theunexhausted margin of the authority air eddy given to them toassist works submitted to them on the new&apos; basis approved bythe Cabinet in April last, or on that now1 submitted forapproval.     This marginal authority would it Is understoodenable, the Committee to assist works to the total value ofsome  750,000.Ill.   Acceleration of Works of other Undertakers.(11) The Committee have considered whether and if sohow far assistance similar to that recommended in thepreceding section of this Report oan be extended to bodiesother than local authorities who can be stimulated to placeadditional orders In the very near future and they recommendthat grants, on the same basis and the same conditions astho.se recommended should be made available to(a) public bodies, that is, any Board, Commission,Rating Authority, or Trustees or other body ofpersons who manage or und&amp;rtake work in pursuanceof statutory power, not being a body trading forprofit?(b) undertakings of the same nature as thosecarried on by public bodies but trading for profit;Provid ed that in the case of undertakingsconducted by companies for private profit, thedividends of which&apos;are not limited by Statute, the
&apos;  Unemployment Grants Committee shall be required toimpose as a term of,the grant(a) That the devislon of the profits of theCompany by way of dividends or bonus shall belimited ; in su$h manner and for such periodnormally gg&apos; the Committee may prescribe, or(b) That tho grant or such part thereof asthe- Committee may prescribe shall be repaidon such conditions as may be determined by the&apos; Committee^, and that failing fulfilment of the&quot;&quot;&quot; &quot;&apos; conditions, so imposed the whole grant shall be- repayable on demand.&apos; It would be necessary to exclude railway companiesfrom the application of the granto :-&apos;- - IV-. Bxoort Credits Scheme,(12)        -&quot;The bommittee concur In . the recommendation of. theT,om?t Affairs Committee that the Overseas Trade (Credit and insurance) Act,  1920, be included ,in the Schedule to the expiring laws C on tinuance: Bill * --.. ..... .(13) The effect of&quot;this will be to extend the period within which credits may;-be granted under the&quot;Aot up to 8thSeptember, 19235-but it &quot;does not. affect tho date by whichcredits are&apos; repayable by the. 8th. September, 1927.Representations have &quot;-been&quot;-received urging that this latterperiod should also&apos; be extended so as to facilitate the grantof credits&apos;up to five years.or so for engineering contracts etcIhe negotiation of contracts Is a lengthy business, and it Isstated that&apos; it of ten&apos; would not be worth while for a rms toenter into:&quot;suoh &quot;negotiations unless they have more than asingle year &quot;ahead -of. - them   It, is therefore desirable thatthe period within which credits may be granted should beextended f or not less than two years.
(14) The Committee recommend that legislation should beIntroduced at the earliest opportunity for (a) extending to 8th September, 1925,  the period within which credits maybe granted under the Act, and. (b) extending to 8th September,1930,  the period within which credits so granted should, be liquidated.V. Financial Co-operation with Dominions and Crown Colonies*(15) The Committee understand that proposals for thefinancial co-operation of the Mother country in the develop-men t of the Dominions and the Crown Colonies are receiving the consideration of another Committee of the Cabinet, butthey take this opportunity of stating that from the pointof view of the alleviation of unemployment,  they attachprincipal importance to this form of Governmental action.They recommend that the earliest opportunitybe taken to introduce legislation providing for suchco-operation.(16) The Financial Secretary to the Treasury dissentedfrom the recommendation contained in Sections III, IV and Vof this Report.(SGD) P.

Sir,I am directed by the Unemployment Grants Committeeto refer to their circular letter of the 18th May last-regarding schemes of work to be undertaken by localauthorities, with State..assistance, for the relief ofunemployment during the coming winter.   Since the issue ofthat letter, His Majestyfa Government have given furtherconsideration to the prospects of employment in the coming winter.   In affording assistance to local authorities theGovernment desire particularly to stimulate employment ofa normal character in Industrial districts where theunemployment is most serious and where the ordinary type of relief work hitherto assisted Is not appropriate for theneeds of the workpeople conoerned.   The Government have,therefore^ decided to offer the following terms to assistrevenue producing schemes In which a substantial part of theexpenditure will take the form of orders for material whichwill give employment In an Industry which is seriously affected,though not necessarily in the area In which the work is tobe carried out.For the purpose -e of securing the acceleration ofrevenue producing works of this kind, it is proposed that theState should pay for a period of 15   years, or for the periodof the loan, whichever is the less, grants on the basis.of &apos;r50 per cent, of the interest on auch loans with a currencynot less than ton years.   It will of course be a conditionof assistance that all contracts should be placed in thiscountry.With a view to the early settlement of the programmeof works for the coming winter, I am desired by the Committeeto request the Authority at once to examine the possibilityof putting in hand this winter, worla of the kind describedmt lii
whloh, In other circumstances, the local authority might be disposed to defer to a later date.    Proposals should besubmitted In rough outline as soon as possible, and in any event not later than the end of the current month.   Inmaking preliminary proposals the Authority should include anestimate of the expenditure to be incurred and of the valueof the orders to be placed.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,
