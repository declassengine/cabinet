The Cabinet had before then? the draft of a statementNecessitous     to be made in Parliament by the Minister of Health, on theAreas .question of Grants to Necessitous Areas (Paper C.P.-371(23)).(PreviousRyforehoe: The Cabinet agreedCabinet 41(23), Con- That, subject to the&apos;addition of a sentenceelusion 4.) to ensure that in making advances to PoorLaw Authorities, regard should be bad toproper and efficient administration by theLocal Authorities, the Minister of Health,should be authorised to make the followingsiatement:-*After very full consideration, the Governmenthave come to the conclusion that they areunable to accede vo the request to make freegrants to Poor Law Authorities iri aid ofexpenditure on relief.   They recognise,however, that some further assistance isnecessary to enable the authorities to relieve the immediate rate burden in areas where the distress has been prolonged andis still serious, and they have decided tomake further financial provision for theextension of the existing facilities underwhich advances by wry of loan are made bythe Ministry of Health and the scottish board of Health on the recommendation ofthe Committee presided over by Sir HarryGosohen..   Under existing arrangements advances areonly made to authorities who satisfy theCommittee that they are unable to borrowin the market.    It is proposed to authorisethe Committee in future to recommend the granting of loans, by the Departments inthe case of the more heavily burdenedauthorities where they are satisfied thatsome immediate relief in the current rate
burden is essential, of such, amount andfor such, period as the circumstancesrequire.    The Committee will be author-ised in suitable cases to recommend that payment of interest and repayment of the loans should be postponed for a period and that before the expiry of that period the terms of repayment should be reviewed in consultation with the Local authority in the light of the ciz^cumstanees thenprevailing.&quot;
.3.   The Cabinet had under consideration the folio-wingdocuments in regard to unemployment the Report of the Cabinet Committee(Paper C .P.-356( 23)):A Memorandum by the Secretary for Scotland(Paper C ,Po-366(23)).The Cabinet agreed  That the Minister of Labour should beauthorised tc annoxince in the Kouse ofCommons such of the proposals in theReport of tho Ce.bi.net Committee as hadbeen approved by the Treasury.    He should inform Pcrlia-tijcnt&apos; that the Cabinet Com-mittee on UiiHr-employment would be in sessionduring the vaeavion, arid that he hoped tobe able to oiahe a further announcement inthe Autumn.    This statement would enablethe Minister of Labour to demonstrate thatthe same action for the relief of unemploy-ment &amp;a hud been ttvken last winter was tobe continued, and thut the question wasbeing closely w&amp;tchod.
sjpARATIONS.fgtfiOUS5f9ren.Ce&apos;.ubinat 43*3), Oon-msion S.)3. The Cabinet had before than the following documents in regard t o Rsparations:-A Note from the French Ambassador to theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs(Foreign Office Paper G.13105/1/18):A Note fro2? the Belgian Ambassador to theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs(Foreign Office Paper 0.13106/1/18):A Note by the Financial Secretary to theTreasury, covering a Treasury Memorandum(Paper CP.-353(83)).The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs submitted the French and Belgian Notes to a detailed analysis, andsummed up by pointing out that the French Note indicated a determined opposition by the French Government to any immediate move in the direction of a settlement and an intention to prolong negotiations until Germany collapsed.The Belgian Note, though courteous in tone, was, in substance, no better from the British point of view.Neither the French nor the Belgian Note contained anycomment on the joint Allied reply forwarded by the BritishGovernment, nor did the Notes give any recognition to thevery conciliatory tone of the British Note to which theyware a reply,In the course of a discussion of the various courses open to the British Government, a suggestion was made thatcertain neutral countries should be encouraged to carryout their intention of raising the question of Reparationsat the Assembly of the League of Nations as a circumstancevaffecting international relations whichthreatens to disturb international peace or the good understanding between nationsupon which peace depends&quot; (Article- XI ofthe Covenant) .This proposal met with considerable support.
The Cabinet agreed --(a) That the Prime Minister in the House ofCommons, and the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs in the House of Lords,should, on the following day   make astatement on the subject of Reparations.The statement should contain a briefresume, of the events which had passedsince the last statement on July 12th*namely, that the British Government had carried out the intention then announcedof suggesting a text for a Joint Replyto be&quot;made by the Allies to the german note of June 7th, and had accompanied it by a despatch.   The sJepliee had containedno indication that the French and belgian governments regarded a joint reply as desirable.   In the e ire urns tanoss theBritish Government considered it essen-tial to publish their Notes to the world and proposed to lay papers as early aspossible.   They were in communicationwith their Allies as to which of the notes could be published.(b) That the statement should be drawn up bythe Secretary of Stats for Foreign affairs for tha approval of the Prime Minister.(c) That advantage should be taken by the PrimtfMinister of his Intervention in the Debitson the following day to impress on Parliamsntthe fact that the occupation of the Ruhr wasinseparably connected with the whole ques-tion of Reparations, and that the economicsituation not only of Germany but of GreatBritain and the whole world was affectedthereby.   If any enquiries were made in either House on the subject, it should beroads clear that the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs had always advised the GermanGovernment to drop passive resistances.(d) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should consult the Allies, so far asthey were respectively concerned, with a viewto the publication of the following documents:(1) The German Note of June 7th.(li) The Questionnaire addressed to thoFrench and. Belgian Governments askingtheir views on&quot; certain points in theGerman Note.I ill) The reply of the French Governmentwhich had bean so long dslaysd.(iv) The Note from the Secretary of stats for Foreign Affairs to th^ Ambassadorsof Franca, Italy, Japan and Belgium.(v) The British draft of an Allied Replyto the German Nots of Juna 7th.(vi) The French Reply to No.(lv).(vil) The Belgian Reply to No,(iv).
(viii) (The Italian Government -did not propose to sand a written reply,but the question arises of repro-\ducing reports of conversations with the Italian Ambassador.)(ix) The final British Reply. (See (e) below.)(e) That the Seoretary of State for ForeignAffairs should prepare, for the cons id-era ti on of the Cabinet, the draft of theBritish Reply, in conciliatory termst tothe French and Belgian Governments, whichmight, if Lord Curaon thought it desirable,be incorporated in a single&quot; document.   this reply should include, either in a separateannexed Memorandum or otherwise, a statementof British polxcy in regard to Reparations,and should be in the nature of an appeal tothe public opinion of the world, setting forth the reasons of the British action in proposing a joint Reply to Germany anddeeply deploring that their efforts had met with so little response.-6-
4. The Cabinet bad before them the Interim Report oa Cabinet Committee on Imported Malting Barley (PaperO.F .-365(23) ) .The Cabinet agreed  That the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries should give the followingreply on Wednesday, August 1st, to aQuestion in the House of Commons:-&quot;Since I made the announcement of theGovernment&apos;s intention to impose anExcise Duty on imported malting barleyI have been advised that this coursewould not bo possible without modifi-cation of the provisions of certaincommercial treaties with foreigncountries,   The Government are,therefore, considering the alterna-tive method of dealing with thematter by. moans of a Customs Duty.I regret that in consequence it hasnot been possible to introduce legisla-tion before the harvest.    The various interests concerned are being consulted,and pending the result of these discus--Sions I can make no annoxincement as tothe date when the Government&apos;s proposal will be laid before Parliament .?r
jfcTSH LAND;pjf.,with.ASE.5. Tha Cabinet had before their; the following documents in regard to Land Purchase in Northern ireland  )d purchase in NorthernT^s land,A Note by the Secretary, covering a conclusion of the Cabinet Committeeon Irish Affairs (Paper CP.-348(23)):iRef erenos:lOabinet 361(23), Con-feiusion 3.)A Note by the Secretary of State fortha Colonies, covering a Report by theCabinet Committee on Irish Affairs ona Report of Lord Eustace Percy&apos;s Committeeon Land Purchase in Northern IrelandfPaper C.P,-353(g3)).The Secretary of Stats for the Colonies warned theCommittee, landlords in Northern Ireland would receive from 9 to 20 per cent, more in respect of land purchasethan would be given in Southern Ireland under Free Statelegislation.   .     -The Cabinet agreed, on the understanding that theywere not committed to the financial proposals involvedin the Rsportbf Lord, Eustace Percy&apos;s Committee,Cabinet that,under the proposals of Lord Eustace PercyfsThat the Secretary of State for theColonies should be authorised toprepare for their consideration aBill based on the Report.
POSEDr iKDOWis.viousfgrenc s:binst 1J), Con-osion 5.;6. The Minister of Labour raised,&quot; as amatter- of urgency, the question of the proposed Port of LondonExtension..   He recalled that the late Prime minister had, as a measure in relief of unemployment, sanctionedfinancial facilities being given for this extension,which, however, had bean held up owing to difficultiesin regard to Labour conditions.   As the result of negotiations-tions, the contractor had now agreed to select a majorityof the -unskilled labour from the London Labour Exchanges,and, as regards the remainder, to employ only persons resident in Great Britain:    that is to say, the contractorwas not bound to employ more than 51 per cent, of Londonlabour, and intended to import unskilled labour from other districts in Great Britain to the extent of 45 to 48 percent.   This might occasion difficulties, particularly inview of the Locks situation, but, failing agreement inthis aHrargeruent, the whole contract would fall to the ground and London would not receive the benefit even of the 51per -cent * of labour.The Cabinet agreed  To approve the above arrangement in regardto labour in order that the Extension Schemeslight be. put in hand and unemployment tothat extant relieved.
Lli.7.   The Cabinet agreed  To authorise the Secretary for scotland to introduce the Smoke Abatement (Scotland)Bill (Paper C.P.-352(23)) on the under-standing that no undertaking could begiven that it would be proceeded with inthe Autumn.3, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,August 1, 1923.
