Inthe meantime they must see what compensa-tion is actually awarded under the newIrish Act,, and,when that is ascertained,if the awards appear to them, to be inequit-able,  they hold&apos; themselves responsible forsecuring to the claimant such addition tothe award as will make it equitable.&quot;The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the second part of the above recora-mendation was not acceptable, as, ifannounced, it would give the impression that the British Government anticipatedthat the Irish Free State Governmentwould not pay its obligations, and mighttend to encourage not only additionalGlairs but even further outrages:(b) That it was desirable, if possible, to. establish personal contact with theGovernment of the Irish Free State on thesubject of compensation, with the doubleobject of speeding up the machinery for thepayment of pre-Truce claims, many of whichhave been approved by the Wood RentonCommission,  and of ascertaining the precisemeaning and the limitations of the Irishcompensation act passed by the-Bail, andthe intentions o-f the Irish Free StateGovernment in giving effect to it:(c) That, as it was foreseen that Mr Oosgravewould have political difficulties in coming to London to discuss the matter with the -Cabinet Committee, the best plan would befor Sir Samuel Hoare, who had in the previous year visited Dublin on behalf of the Govern-ment for the purpose of discussing the qn.es-tlon of compensation with the President ofthe Irish Free State, should again pay a visit to Dublin in order to obtain all theinformation required and generally to explore the position:(d) That the Colonial Office should, prepare aMemorandum for the guidance of Sir samuel hoare:
(e) That, in -receiving the Deputation repre-santing the Loyalists of Southern ireland on the following day, the Secretary ofState for the Colonies should he authorisedto make clear that the Government holdthemselves bound by the undertakings givenby Mr Churchill on the 11th July, 1922, onthe subject of compensation!    that one ofhis colleagues had been deputed to visitDublin in order to discuss the question with Mr Cosgravo and to ascertain the intentions of the Irish Free State Gov-eminent and the position in this respect in which they were placed by the compen-sation bill passed by the Dail.   He should further be authorised to suggest to theDeputation the desirability that Mr Gosgraveshould be put in touch with the importantinterests they represented, and to intimatethat, if-desired, Sir Samuel Hoare*s good offices might be taken advantage of inorder to arrange for Mr Cosgrave to seeanyone they might depute to represent them:(f) That the Secretary of -State for Air (SirSamuel Ho are) should be added to the CabinetCommittee on Irish Affairs .

PARLIAMENTARY      7.   After &quot;hearing, from the Prime Minister a preliminaryprUjepure .statement in regard to the pressure from certain elements in Parliament in favour of the appointment of a SelectCommittee on the procedure of the House of Commons, andof an alternative proposal that a Committee, either ofthe House of Commons or of both Houses, should be appoint-ed to consider an alteration in the annual time-table ofParliamentary business -  for example, that the sessions should normally open before Christmas and close at theend of July   the Cabinet agreed  -That a Memorandum-submitted to the PrimeMinister by the Chief Whip should be cir-culated for consideration at an early meeting.
The Cabinet agreed  That in the discussion in the House ofLords the same afternoon on a Motionsubmitted by Lord sir&amp;enhead on thesubject of Trade Union Funds and PartyLevies, the Government representatives should not go beyond the intentionsannounced by the late Prime Minister(Mr Bonar Law), namely, that later inthe year, when they had less oh their hands, the Government proposed to con-,suit the Trade Union leaders and others concerned and to try and get an arrangement that would seem fair to reasonablemembers of Trade Unions.
TFTJIURE SIZE 9 . The attention of the Cabinet (Was called to aOP THE ; &quot;;, tREGULAR Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War on theARMY.subject of the future size of the Regular Army (paper cp .-200(23)), on which the Chancellor of the exchequer had commented in a Memorandum (Paper CP.-248(23)) .With a&quot; view more especially to removing&apos; thegeneral apprehensions which exist as to the probability of further reductions in the Regular Army and the set-back to the recruiting, more particularly of officersicaused.thereby, the Cabinet agreed  (a) That, in view of the fact that theRegular Army had now been reduced tothe furthest limit compatible with national safety., the Secretary ofState for War should be authorisedto make an announcement in the Rouseof lords, at his convenience,, to the .effect that no material further reduc-tion in the total establishment of theRegular Army would take place.    Thisdecision, however, should not preclude the Army Cotincil from making adjust-ments between the- e stab 1 ishraetits ofthe several Arms and Servicest(b) That in order to obtain wide publicity to the announcement,  the Secretary ofState should make a full statement onthe subject in the House of Lords:(c) That decision (a) above included thecontinued maintenance of such existing-British Cavalry Regiments &amp;a might becomesurplus to the requirements of India,though this should not necessarily be announced .The Secretary of State for War was askedto consider whether, without weakeninghis announcement, it would be&apos; possibleto introduce some words, in his statement in the House of lords, with the object&apos; of avoiding any possible set-back to thecause of the limitation of armaments, orany excuse to militaries nations tomake similar announcements and therebycommit themselves against any furtherlimitation of armaments .3,.

The Committee held one meeting under the Chairman-ship of fhe late Minister of Health, and one meetingunder my Chairmanship,On each occasion the Solicitor-General found him-self unexpectedly detained in Court and unable to attend.Between the two meetings a Private Member&apos;s Billupon the subject has beon introduced by Sir Arthur^Shirley Bonn, backed by Sir Leslie Scott,  following.,the general lines proposed by the latter whenSolicitor-General.INTRODUCTIONOF BILL.
1,     The Committee decided to recommend, as regards legislation:that the best plan would be not to have a Government bill and as regards Sir Arthur Shirley Benn1s Bill that nofacilities should be given by the Government unless the Billemerged from Committee in a form which was not seriouslycontroversial.2.      That an amendment in the sense of that already putdown by Mr. Gosling to give an express statutory exception &quot;to the Jewish method of slaughtering should be supportedby the Government.,3.     That the Government should support the further amendmentalready put down for the omission of paragraph (c) of sub-section (2) of section 1, which empowers the Minister ofHealth to extend the provisions of the Bill to slaughter^Lng^^,.^^elsewhere than in slaughter houses.4.     That the Government, should move that the definition of slaughterhouse be altered so as to apply the PublicHealth Act def Ini-cicn^5.      That they should move that the penalty clause be altered so as, to make it clear that the penalties mentionedwas re maxima,,6*      (a) That on Rule 3 in the Schedule (which requires a mechanical stunning instrument) the Government should move to omit the words &quot;and approved by the Minister ofHealth on the advice of an expert Committee appointed byhim&quot; on the ground that in the present state of knowledgeit was better to leave &quot;suitability&quot; and &quot;sufficiency&quot;to be determined as a matter of fact, thus following the model bye law which had been approved by the High Court.(b) That in Committee it should be stated that,while the Minister was not. prepared to accept a
statutory obligation to prescribe the stunning instrument,he was willing to appoint an Expert Committee and on receiving their conclusions to communicate them to.localauthorities.(c) That if the meat traders urged that this expert committee should consider not merely the &quot;suitabilityand sufficiency&quot; of the instrument but its effects uponthe meat, the answer of the Government should be that the expert Committee would bo at liberty to receive any information which was sent to it, but it would only beset up after the principle that there should be amechanical stunning instrument had been accepted byParliament, and therefore that tho only business of the committee would be to consider which, of&quot; various- instrumentswas most suitable.III.The Committee have received a large amount ofevidence on tho subject o &apos; the use of mechanical stunninginstruments in slaughterhouses, including representations from the National Federation of Meat Traders Associations,and others, in favour of a general enquiry into the whole. question.     They have decided that they are not preparedto recommend the Government to institute such an enquiry.The questions arising on model bye-law 9,Bo  (which if adopted by a local authority makes mechanical stunninginstruments compulsory) had already been fully exploredand - whilst a Committee could be accepted for the limited purposes of Bule 3 in the Schedule to the Bill(sec 11(6)(b) and (c) above - it would not bo&apos;accopted in- &apos; i - f,a form which wouxci ro-opon the whole question, as suggestedby the moat trade&quot;,Signed on behalf of the Committee.NEVILLE CHAMBERLAINChairman,24th, May5 1923*
