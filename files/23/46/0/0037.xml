The Cabinet had under consideration the situation arising out of the defeat of the Government in the Houseof Commons on the Address to the King on the previous evening, and the polioy and procedure resulting therefrom.The Cabinet were informed that the Motion by thePrime Minister, that the House should adjourn untilFebruary 12th, had been objected to by certain numbers,and, owing to the lateness of the hour, it had not beenpossible, under the Rules of the House, to proceed withthe Motion.   Consequently the House would meet on the same afternoon at the usual hour.     If the Prime Minister wereto resign, and his successor were to &quot;kiss hands&quot; as FirstLord of the Treasury before Parliament met the same after-noon, an awkward Parliamentary situation would arise.This would be due to the fact that the Motion to adjournstood in the name of the present Prime Minister.After careful consideration of the precedents of 1886and 1892, the Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Prime Minister should offer his resignation to t3possible moment:resignation to the King at the earliest(b) That the Secretary should communicate by telephone with Lord Stemiordham, whom heshould ask to submit to His Majesty the
Cabinet1s view that, from a Parliamentaryppint of view, the most convenient prooe-dure, in the event of the King deciding to send for Mr Ramsay MacDonald, wouldbe as follows:-That the King, immediately after receiving the Prime Ministersresignation, should hold a Meetingof the Privy Council for the purposeof swearing Mr Ramsay MacDonald aMember of the Council.   His Majestywould then ask Mr Ramsay MaeDonaldto form a Government, but the ceremonyof &quot;kissing hands&quot; on appointment asFirst Lord&quot;of the Treasury should be postponed until after the Parliament-ary Debate.    Thus, when Parliament met,Mr Baldwin would still technically bePrime Minister (his successor not yethaving been appointed), and the motion for adjournment could proceed in his name.(e) That, in the event of the King accepting the Prime Minister&apos;s resignation, the PrimeMinister and the Leader of the House ofLords should inform Parliament the same afternoon that the Government had resigned,that their resignation had been accepted,and that they only held their Seals until their successors were appointed.(d) That Ministers should be prepared to answer questions in the House of Commons as usual,but should take no part in the Debate onthe Motion for Adjournment.(e) That after the resignation of the PrimeMinister, while Ministers would of coursehold their offices until their successorshad taken over the Seals or relieved them,it must .be clear that any action on urgent matters (such as night arise, for example,in connection with the Railway Strike) mustbe taken on the responsibility of the newPrime Minister.

The Prime Minister, on behalf of his colleagues,eaqwo^sed the thanks of the Cabinet to Sir Maurice Hankeyfor tha rrexk33r--as*iel.a Kj^^        he had at all timesrendered tb members in the discharge of,his duties as secretary to the Cabinet.* * * *THE CABINET..(\2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,January 22, 1924.
