Printed for the Cabinet.   july 1923.SECRET.Appendix.C.p-360 (23). -CABINET.IMPERIAL ECONOMIC CONFERENCE. (DOCUMENTS) COMMITTEE.REPORT.Composition of Committee and Terms of Reference.1. IN pursuance of Cabinet 25 (23) Conclusion 3, the following Committee was constituted for the purpose of sanctioning the transmission to the Dominions andIndia of documents prepared for the Economic Conference : The Secretary of State for the Colonies (in the Chair),The Secretary of State for India,The President of the Board of Trade,The Financial Secretary to the Treasury,withMr. R. B. Ho worth andMr. E. R. Eddison as Joint Secretaries.2 By Cabinet 32 (23) Conclusion 5, the Cabinet agreed to extend theCommittee&apos;s Terms of Reference so as to authorise the Committee to make recommendations to the Cabinet in regard to the documents under consideration.3. The First Lord of the Admiralty, the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries,the Parliamentary Secretary to the Department of Overseas Trade, and Departmentalrepresentatives have attended meetings of the Committee when questions of special interest have been under consideration.4. The Committee have held three Meetings and have carefully consideredMemoranda submitted to them by an Inter-Departmental Committee and also by various Departments. A list of the Memoranda in question is contained inAppendix I of this Report. The Committee do not consider that at the present stage it is necessary to circulate the documents in question to the Cabinet, but steps are being taken to print those documents which will be required for the use ofMinisters at the Economic Conference, and copies of the prints will be availablelater, if required.5. In the following paragraphs the Committee make recommendations to theCabinet on various questions which have arisen in the course of their deliberations,indicating briefly their reason for a particular recommendation.Imperial Preference.6. In considering this subject the Committee have had before them, in additionto the large Memorandum by the Inter-Departmental Committee (I.E.C. &quot; B &quot;Series I) a letter from the First Lord of the Admiralty commenting on that memorandum and making certain further suggestions (I.E.C. &quot; B &quot; Series XIII);detailed memoranda prepared by the Board of Trade and the Customs dealing withParticular topics, viz., Currants (I.E.C. &quot; B &quot; Series XI), Preserved Fruit andCanned Fish (I.E.C. &quot; B &quot; Series X), and Tobacco (I.E.C. &quot; B &quot; Series XII and^Ha); and a memorandum on Stamp Duties and Income Tax (I.E.C. &quot; B &quot; SeriesXVIII) prepared by the Inter-Departmental Committee in consultation with theBoard of Inland Revenue.[10423] b
Ministerial Pledges.7. At the outset, the attention of the Committee was specially drawn to the pledge given by the late Prime Minister not to make any fundamental change in theBritish fiscal system during the present Parliament,&apos; and to- the ;suggestedinterpretation of this pledge that no new protective duty should be imposed unless aspecial case could be made out for exceptional treatment, and that preference should therefore continue to be incidental to the duties primarily imposed either for revenueor for protection so limited. It was suggested that the Ministerial pledge did not preclude the grant of an increased preference, or the institution of a new dutyincluding preference on goods in the same category as goods already subject topreference; that in any case the pledge must be interpreted liberally, having regardto the very valuable rebates allowed by the Dominion Governments, and particularly by Australia, and to the slight financial benefits accruing to the Dominions from theexisting preferences. It was also suggested that whatever further concessions weremade should be granted to the whole Empire, and should not be the subject of separateDominion agreements.8. The Committee recommend 1(1.) That the line to be taken should be that in order to encourage thedevelopment of Empire settlement and the granting of Dominionpreference to British goods, as well as with a view to the alleviation ofunemployment at. home, the British Government should endeavour togive as extensive further preferences as may be possible without violation of the Ministerial pledges,(2.) That any concession made should be granted generally to the whole Empire,and should not be the subject of separate Dominion agreements.*(3.) That a total remission of the duty on certain Empire products is not inconsistent with the Ministerial pledges.(4.) That the imposition of any new or increased duty on food should be conditional on an adjustment being made in respect of other duties on food, so as to secure that food taxation should not be increased in theaggregate.9. The following paragraphs deal with the particular extensions of preferenceor imposition of new duties which the Committee have had under consideration.For convenience, a brief summary of the Committee&apos;s recommendations in favour ofnew or increased preferences is given in Appendix II.Dried Fruits.10. Australia is the Dominion most concerned in this matter, and it isunderstood that she will probably ask that total remission of duty should be accordedin respect of dried fruits of Empire production, and, further, that the present rateof duty (10s. Qd. per cwt.) on raisins and prunes should be extended to currants.She will also probably suggest that the duty of 10s. Qd, per cwt. should be appliedto certain classes of dried fruits which are at present duty free, e.g., dried peachesand apples.11. As regards currants, a difficulty arises. To raise the duty on currants above2s. per cwt. would require a modification in the present Anglo-Greek Convention,which, however, has already been denounced by the Greek Government and is onlycontinued; by an arrangement terminable by three months&apos; notice. The ForeignOffice are apprehensive of the political effect of proposing such a modification in viewof the great dependence of Greece on the export of currants, and there may also be-some anxiety in Lancashire as to the possible loss of trade advantages enjoyed byBritish cotton and other goods in the Greek market. On the other hand, our tradewith Greece is trifling compared with our trade with Australia, and the Committeedo not feel, it possible politically to return a purely negative answer to the Australiandemand simply oh the ground of our interest in Greek trade. At the same time, theevidence before them leads them to doubt if the grant of that demand would inpractice be of much advantage to Australia or disadvantage to Greece, which has apractical monopoly of the best class of currants.* An exception to this general rule will be found in the case of tobacco, see paragraph 21 below.
12. The Committee recommend That in the event of the question of an increased preference on Currantsbeing raised at the Imperial Economic Conference, the representatives ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government should have a free hand to deal with the. , Australian demand on its merits, within the limits of the proposal whichhas been under consideration by the Committee^ namely, an increase of theduty on foreign Currants from 2s. to a fate not exceeding 10s. 6d. per cwt.,with complete exemption for Empire Currants. They should, at the sametime, be requested to bear in mind the importance of so timing andpresenting any consequential proposals to Greece as to minimise the politicaland economic disadvantages apprehended by the Foreign Office.13. As regards other dried fruits, the Committee recommend -(a.) That an extension of the existing tariff rate to certain classes of dried fruitswhich are at present duty free would not be inconsistent with Ministerialpledges, and should be conceded if pressed for by the Dominions.(b.) That dried fruits of Empire production should be admitted free of duty toGreat Britain.Preserved Fruits and Jams.14. Briefly, the present situation is that dried or preserved fruits imported(other than raisins, currants and figs, and all kinds of plums) are duty free in theUnited Kingdom, but when preserved in sugar (e.g., fruits in syrup, jam^ &amp;c.) are changed with duty on the sugar content. The proposal is to impose a duty onpreserved fruits as such (in addition to the existing duty on sugar, if any, Used inpreserving), and to exempt Empire fruits altogether from the new duty so imposed.*15. The Committee considered whether the new duty should be imposed on all foreign fruit, or whether it should not rather be confined to those sorts in which theDominions are interested. The former alternative would, it was urged, have theadvantage of giving an immediate preference to all Dominion fruit products, andthus would encourage Dominion growers to compete with the foreigner in frUitswhich at present they do not produce.16. On the other hand, it was represented that it would be easier to defend theimposition of a duty and the grant of a preference in respect of items specially askedfor by the Dominions, and that there would be no difficulty in adding items to thepreference list hereafter should any Dominion wish for such an addition. Moreover,the Committee felt that fruits (such as dates) which form, a cheap, staple article offood should be exempt from the duty. Fruit pulp should also be exempt, as it is araw material for the British jam manufacturer.17. The Committee recommend, after careful consideration (1.) That authority should be given to the representatives of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment at the Imperial Economic Conference to propose (a;) That a duty of 5s. per ewt., in addition to the existing duty on sugar(if any) used in preserving, should be imposed on foreign preservedapples, pears, pineapples, peaches, apricots and nectarines.   Otherpreserved fruits could be added to the list hereafter should theDominions so wish.(&amp;.) That Empire-preserved fruits should be exempt from this new duty.(2.) That no proposal should be entertained for extending the duty to fruit pulp.Note. It is estimated that the duty on the fruits specified would produce about 250,000 a year.Sugar..18. The position is, briefly, that the existing preference on sugar is one-sixth, or about \d. a lb.,.and there is a strong demand for an increase of. this preference toone-third, and for its consolidation for a period of years. It is understood that bothAustralia and South Africa are likely to raise the question at the,Conference, butthe main benefit of an increase in the preference on sugar would doubtless. accrue to* The position With regard to these articles is fully discussed in I.E.C. (&quot;B&quot;,series) I (pp4 15-17) andI-E.C. (&quot;B&quot; series) X. &quot;;&apos;[10423] b 2
Crown Colonies Mauritius and the West Indies. The doubling of the preferencewould involve a loss to the Exchequer of about  2,200,000 per annum (a large pro-portion of which would in effect represent a free gift to the sugar-growers ofMauritius), and the adoption of such a proposal would meet with great opposition from the British refiners.19. The Committee have had under consideration the practicability of giving anundertaking that the existing preference should be maintained for, say; ten years,and also the practicability of a further undertaking that, for. a period of ten years as from January 1926, the preference should be increased to Id. per lb. It was repre-sented to them that an undertaking to give a preference of Id. per lb. onEmpire-grown sugar for a period of ten years would undoubtedly encourage extensivedevelopment in the West Indies and elsewhere, and that the resulting demand formachinery, &amp;c, would help unemployment at home. The Committee understand,however, that the Chancellor of the Exchequer is quite unable to assent to any increasein the existing rate of preference on sugar. The Treasury point out that the cost ofthe proposal would be very heavy, and that if adopted the scheme would make it moredifficult than ever to reduce the present high sugar duty.20. After weighing the matter carefully, the Committee recommend That the representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Government at the ImperialEconomic Conference should be authorised to propose that a preference ofan amount not less than the present amount, viz., approximately \d. a lb.,should be given for a period of ten years on all Empire sugar imported intoGreat Britain.Tobacco.21. The existing preference on tobacco amounts to about one-sixth of the duty,and if this were increased to one-third the cost to the Exchequer would be 600,000 per annum in the first year, with a tendency to increase as cultivation withinthe Empire developed.22. The results of the inquiries recorded in LEG. &quot;B &quot; Series XII, indicate thatwhile the Imperial Tobacco Company and the other firms consulted are not actuallyhostile to an increase of the existing preference, they are agreed that such an increase would tend to stimulate the production of inferior tobacco, and that what is reallyneeded is a considerable improvement in the quality and in the curing and grading of the raw material. On the other hand, it must be remembered that the Unionof South Africa will certainly press for increased preference, and the Committeethink it most desirable, if possible, to meet South African views in the matter.23. The existing preference on Empire-grown tobacco is already large (i.e.,probably 70 per cent, ad valorem), and it may be argued that if, with their existingadvantages, the Dominions cannot compete, it is improbable that they ever will beable to compete. The loss of revenue would be very substantial if the existingpreference were increased for the Empire as a whole (even if the increase were only to one-quarter instead of to one-third);, and in this connection attention maybe drawn to the very large tobacco production of India, a country which gives nopreference to Empire goods, m view of these considerations, the Committee have thought it necessary to consider whether it would not be desirable to exclude india from any general increase of the tobacco preference.24. The Secretary of State for India accordingly consulted confidentially withthe Government of India on this point, and the result of his inquiries was to indicatethat, if it were decided to limit the proposed increase of preference to Empire-growntobacco other than tobacco grown in India, there seemed no reason to suppose that, inthe circumstances, any great exception would be taken to such a proposal by indian opinion.25. There is no doubt great weight to be attached to the argument that, notwith-standing the result of the Secretary of State&apos;s inquiries, it is preferable, on broadgrounds of policy, that His Majesty&apos;s Government should adhere to the general principle of most-favoured-nation treatment within the Empire, rather than enter upon anew system of special agreements by which preference should be,given onlyto those parts of the Empire which are prepared to reciprocate. The Committee,however, feel it difficult in view of the result of the inquiries b) the Secretary ofState for India, and in view of the considerable loss of revenue which is involved, to
recommend the extension of the increased preference to tobacco grown in India. Itis true that Nyasaland, the other important source of Empire tobacco, also givesno.preference to British goods, but the Committee felt that the case of Nyasalandcouid, perhaps, be distinguished from that of India on the ground that an increasedpreference to Nyasaland tobacco would certainly increase the growth of Empiretobacco.   They have accordingly decided to recommend &apos;That the existing preference on Empire-grown tobacco (other than tobaccogrown in India) should be increased from one-sixth to one-quarter of theduty. t .&apos; ,       r,&apos;\y-- &apos;      .. / T&quot;    /.&apos;,,:.&apos;,,.&apos;.,..&quot;&apos;/&apos;,&apos;Spirits and Wines.,    26. The position as regards Spirits and Wines is briefly discussed in the mainMemorandum, I.E.C. (&quot; B &quot; Series) I.   The Committee recommend That no alteration in the existing preference on spirits or on wines imported .from the Dominions should be entertained.New Duties on Goods at present Duty-free.27. The above proposals have been confined, broadly speaking, to increases ofexisting preferences. It remains to deal with certain suggestions for the impositionof new duties on goods, at present dutjr free, for the purpose of granting preferenceon such goods when of Empire production.Apples.28. The imposition of a duty on raw apples seems to the Committee to be opento many objections, and would, no doubt, give rise to considerable opposition onthe ground that a tax was being levied on a widely popular article of food. after full consideration, the Committee recommend That any proposal to impose a duty on foreign raw apples should be rejected.Canned Fish.29. Information on the subject of Canned Fish is contained in I.E.C. (&quot; B &quot;Series) X. A duty of. 10s. per cwt. on foreign imported fish of the descriptions of which there is a substantial importation both from the Empire and from foreign countries (i.e., salmon, lobsters, crabs, and crayfish) might yield  250,000per annum.The Committee recommend That the representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Government at the ImperialEconomic Conference be authorised to propose the imposition of a duty.. of 10s. per cwt. on foreign-imported canned salmon, lobsters, crabsand crayfish, should any Dominion ask for the imposition of such a duty atthe Conference.Hops.30. The Inter-Departmental Committee suggested in I.E.C. (&quot; B &quot; Series) I,that a duty of  5 a cwt. might be imposed on foreign hops, with duty-freeadmission.of hops grown within the Empire. The Minister of Agriculture andFisheries, however, has expressed the view that there is considerable danger inpermitting Empire hops to be imported entirely free of duty. He informs the.Committee that there is at present a greater quantity of hops available than isrequired, and that hop growers in this country are being told that only three-quarters of their product can be utilised. In the circumstances, the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries suggests that it is really undesirable to encourage the importation ofhops at all. ,&apos;31. The Committee recommend That the representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Government at the ImperialEconomic Conference should be authorised to entertain a proposal to impose a duty of  5 a cwt. on all foreign grown hops after the expiry of the periodof control, a preference of 50 per cent, or 33^ per cent, being accorded toEmpire-grown hops.
Tinplates and Containers.32. The Committee have had under consideration a suggestion by the First Lordof the Admiralty (I.E.C. (B Series) XIII) in favour of an import duty on tinplate,this duty being remitted in the case of containers imported from the Empire whichare made of British tinplate. The object Was to stimulate both the export of Britishtinplate to the Dominions and the export here from the Dominions of all fruits, fish,meat and other foodstuffs put up in tin containers.33. In view of the great practical difficulties to which such a duty would giverise, the proposal was not pressed by the First Lord of the Admiralty.34. The Committee recommend That in view of the practical difficulties involved, the imposition of an import duty on foreign tinplates or containers should not be entertained.Luxury Fruits.35. The Committee have had under consideration suggestions contained in theletter from the First Lord of the Admiralty (I.E.C. (B Series) XIII) in favour of theimposition, of a duty on luxury fruits, such&apos; as pineapples, grape fruits, &amp;e, withpreference for Empire fruits.The Committee recommend That, should any Oversea Government press for it, the representatives ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government at the Imperial Economic Conference should beauthorised to give favourable consideration to the proposal to impose a dutyon foreign grape fruits, or pineapples, or other specified &quot;luxury&quot; fruits(not including oranges) up to a maximum limit of 10s. Qd. a cwt.Stamp Duty and Income Tax*36. Finally, under the heading of Imperial Preference, mention must be made ofthe suggestions&apos; by the First Lord of the Admiralty (I.E.C. (B Series) XIII) in favourof a preferential remission of Stamp Duty on Empire investments and a preferentialdifferentiation of Income Tax as between dividends earned by Empire and hj foreigninvestments. The Committee are impressed by the grave practical difficulties which(as pointed out in the Memorandum I.E.C. (BSeries) XVIII, prepared by the Inter-Departmental Committee with the assistance of the Board of Inland Revenue)appear to be inseparable from these proposals.37. It was suggested to the Committee that it might be practicable to go someway towards meeting the proposals if the existing preference enjoyed in respect ofstamp duty by the securities of Colonial Governments and Municipalities could beextended to railways, harbours and other public utility works with regard to whichthe physical locus of the undertaking could not stand in doubt. It is clear, however,that this would involve the extension of the preference to home undertakings of this character, a result which would be open to strong objections, and, among other things,might be described as a discouragement of industry.38. As regards income tax, the Committee understand that the recent alterations in the law have in effect removed the grievance of duplication of income tax asbetween this country and other parts of the British Dominions,39. After discussion, the First Lord intimated to the Committee that he did not desire to press his proposals.  The Committee recommend That in view of the practical difficulties involved, any extension of imperial preference in connection with stamp duty or income tax should not be entertained;Petroleum Policy i40. The Committee have carefully considered the question of the inclusion in theAgenda of the Imperial Economic Conference of the question of Imperial Policyrespecting Petroleum. The Committee understand that the interested departments are not wholly in agreement as to the rspective merits of the &quot; Open Door &quot; and the restrictive policy in the matter of Oil concessions. There is, at present, no indication that any of the Oversea Governments desire to raise the question, while no Depart-ment represented on the Inter-Departmental Committee has expressed any wish thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government should take the initiative in the matter
In a Memorandum by the Inter-Departmental Committee (I.E.C. (B Series)VI), that Committee recommend His Majesty&apos;s Government to refrain from takingthe initiative in regard to the inclusion of Petroleum questions in the Agenda of theConference. &apos;....   In these circumstances the Committee recommend the Cabinet-. -: - To refrain from taking the initiative in proposing the inclusion in theAgenda for the Imperial Economic Conference of an)?- question relating toPetroleum.Status of Dominion Trade Commissioners.41. The question of the Status of Dominion Trade Commissioners in foreigncountries has been raised by the Canadian Government. At present the Commis-sioners have neither diplomatic nor consular status, and the Canadian government feel that they should be given such recognition as the dignity of their Office demands.It has been suggested that the more important Dominion Commissioners should betreated in this respect in the same way as British Commercial Counsellors and commercial Secretaries in foreign countries, e.g., that the Dominion Trade Commis-sioners should form part of the Embassy or Legation Staffs and thus enjoy diplomaticprivileges and immunities. This solution, however, involves that His Majesty&apos;ambassador or Minister will be responsible for the actions of the Dominion TradeCommissioners vis-a-vis the Foreign Government concerned, and consequently thatthe Dominion Trade Commissioner will look to the Ambassador or Minister for support in his relations with the Foreign Government concerned, and will be subjectto his general guidance in the conduct of these relations.The Committee recommend to the Cabinet (1.) That the more important Dominion Trade Commissioners should, in future,be included in the diplomatic staffs and should be given precisely thesame standing as British Commercial Counsellors and Secretaries, on theunderstanding that each Dominion Trade Commissioner will be subjectto the general supervision and guidance of His Majesty&apos;s Ambassadoror Minister in the country to which he is assigned.(2.) That as regards the less important Dominion Trade Commissioners,endeavours should be made to obtain for them the same recognition,exemptions and privileges as may be accorded by the Foreign government concerned to His Majesty&apos;s Consular Officers in that country.(3.) That the Secretary of State for the Colonies should be authorised to notify the Canadian Government that if that. Government desire to bring thequestion of the Status of Dominion Trade Commissioners before theImperial Economic Conference, the question will be placed on the Agenda.Co-operation in Financial Assistance to Imperial Development.42. The Committee have carefully considered the important question ofco-operation with the Dominions and the Australian State Governments in thedevelopment of the resources of the British Empire to the best possible advantage.The Committee have examined a scheme submitted by the President of the Boardof Trade (see Appendix III), the underlying principle of which is that Great britain should use her credit in order that the Empire might co-operate in development schemes. It is proposed that His Majesty&apos;s Government should make advances ofinterest or guarantee interest within a maximum of  2,000,000 a year to PublicUtility undertakings in the Dominions which are approved by their own Govern-ments and approved also by the British Government. It is intended that the undertakings assisted should be of such a kind that, if put in hand rapidly, theywould confer direct benefit both on the Dominions and on employment by the placing of orders in the United Kingdom. &quot;While the advances of interest would be for aiperiod of years, the intention is that the advances should, wherever possible,ultimately be repayable out of the profits of the undertakings.Representatives of the Banking and Trading interests have expressed themselvesin favour of the policy, and the necessity for drastic measures on the lines indicatedhas been emphasised by the disquieting situation as regards trade prospects indicatedin a Memorandum CP. 312 (23), recently circulated to the Cabinet.After consultation with the Prime Minister, telegrams have been despatched to the Dominion?- ind India, explaining the general lines on -which His Majesty&apos;s
Government will be prepared to consider detailed schemes of co-operation in financialassistance to Imperial development. For text of telegram in question seeAppendix IV.The Committee recommend the Cabinet  -To approve in principle the scheme for co-operation in financial assistanceto Imperial development set out in the Memorandum dated the 12th May,1923, by the President of the Board of Trade (Appendix III).Imperial Preference in Public Contracts.43. The Committee are much impressed with the desirability of securing somecommon measure of agreement among the Departments concerned as to the adoptionof a uniform policy in regard to Imperial Preference in Public Contracts. It isunderstood that the Treasury have taken up the question with the Departmentsconcerned, and in these circumstances the Committee recommend to the Cabinet That if possible uniform rules respecting Imperial Preference in PublicContracts should be adopted, and that  the Inter-Departmental Committeeshould proceed with the preparation of agreed rules to be applied by allG-overnment Departments.Import and Export of Live-Stock.44. The Committee have examined the question whether it would be best for theBritish Government to initiate a discussion on the import and export of live-stock,or whether the matter should be left for the Dominions to raise at the Conference.On the one hand, the political arguments strongly favour the plan of leaving thequestion to be raised by the Dominion Governments; on the other hand, it would be easier for His Majesty&apos;s Government to defend definite proposals submitted by them than to criticise more far-reaching proposals put forward by DominionGovernments.The Committee recommend to the Cabinet (i.) That the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries should be authorised to draft a Bill on the lines of the original Clause 4 of the Importation of animals Bill, 1922.  .(ii.) That the Draft Bill should be submitted to the Imperial EconomicConference, and that the representatives of the British Governmentshould undertake at the Conference to give the same terms to otherDominions as have been given to Canada, and that as regards breeding-stock, such provisions as are made should be on a strictly reciprocal basis.Consultation between the British and Dominion Agriculturalists.45. A suggestion has been made that a meeting should be arranged betweenDominion Agriculture representatives and the British Agricultural AdvisoryCommittee previous to or during the course of the meeting of the Imperial EconomicConference, for the purpose of discussing questions of common interest toagriculturalists at home and overseas. If any useful purpose is to be served theConference must be strictly unofficial and the Government should take no part in it.In these circumstances the Committee have requested the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries to move the Secretary of State for the Colonies tocommunicate the above suggestion to the Dominion Governments as one emanating from unofficial sources.Imperial Co-operation for Economic Defence.46. .The Cabinet will remember that the original telegram of invitation inconnection with the Imperial Economic Conference mentioned as. one of the matters for consideration by the Conference the possibility: of mutual co-operation amongthe various Governments to safeguard their economic interests in relation to foreigncountries, or for promoting international arrangements for the more, equitabletreatment of commerce.The Committee recommend to the Cabinet     ....That the following draft resolution with regard to flag discrimination-   should be approved : 
Workmen&apos;s Compensation.48. The Committee have considered the desirability of a common Empire policy as regards certain aspects of Workmen&apos;s Compensation, and also- the questionwhether this subject.should be placed on the Agenda for the Economic Conference.The Committee have authorised  -  .The Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Secretary of State forIndia to send a communication to the Dominions and India suggesting theaddition to the Agenda for the Conference of an item respecting thedesirability of a common Empire policy as regards certain aspects of workmen&apos;s Compensation, and describing briefly the nature of theproposals m contemplation.[10423] c&quot;Flag Discrimination.&quot; (Draft Resolution).V&apos;In view of the vital importance to the British Empire of safe-- &quot;guarding its overseas carrying trade against all forms of discrimination&quot;by foreign countries, whether open or disguised, the representatives of&quot; the Governments of the Empire declare &quot; (1.) That it is their established practice to make no discrimination&apos;&apos; between the flags of shipping using their ports, and that they&quot;have no intention of departing from this practice as regards&apos;&apos; countries which treat ocean-going shipping under the British flag&quot;on.a footing of equality with their own national shipping.&quot; (2.) That in the event of danger arising in future to the overseas shipping&quot;of the Empire through an attempt by a foreign country to&apos;&apos; discriminate against the British flag, the Governments of the&quot; Empire will consult together as to the best means of meeting the&quot;situation.&quot;Imperial Economic Committee.47. Various proposals, emanating from different quarters, have been made forthe establishment of some continuing body, the function of which would be tocomplete or carry on the work of the Imperial Economic Conference, and thusfurnish a connecting link between that Conference and the next similar Conference.In this connection it has been suggested that it might be preferable to entrustAgricultural questions to a separate body, which might be a Sub-Committee of theproposed continuing Economic Committee. This&apos; Sub-Committee might, or mightnot, in the course of time develop into an independent body, dealing purely with agricultural questions:The Committee recommend to the Cabinet (1.) That the question of an Imperial Economic Committee should be discussed at the Imperial Economic Conference; that the Dominions should be encouraged to initiate the discussion, but, that if they are not preparedto do so, it should be initiated on the part of His Majesty^s Government.(2.) That the arrangement which seems most likely to prove satisfactory is fora general Economic Committee to be constituted, with powers to appointSub-Committees.(3.) That the Terms of Reference to the Committee should be &quot;to consider any&quot; matters of an economic and commercial character, not being matters&quot;within the scope of the Imperial Shipping &apos; Committee, or of any&quot;officially constituted Inter-Imperial Organisation, which may be&quot; referred to them by or through any of the Constituent Governments for&quot; the purpose of facilitating Inter-Imperial trade.&quot;(4.) That if any of the Dominions should suggest the addition to the Terms ofReference of such words as &quot; while fully respecting the autonomy of the&quot; various Governments of the Empire in matters of commercial and fiscal&quot; policy,&quot; the amendment should be accepted.(5.) That the Inter-Departmental Committee should be instructed to work out in greater detail a scheme for the representation of the various governments or interests on the Committee in accordance with the principles indicated.
Co-operation for Technical Research.49. The Committee did not feel in a position to deal with this Item in theAgenda of the Imperial Conference pending the receipt of the Report of theCommittee which is now considering the reorganisation in the future of the imperial institute. The Committee understood that the Report in question is now practicallysettled, but that it would not be available for Ministers for at least another fortnight.The Committee have accordingly requested the Parliamentary Under-Secretary tothe Colonial Office and the Parliamentary Secretary, Department of Overseas Trade,to act as a small Sub-Committee to consider the above Report as soon as received, andto recommend whether it should be transmitted to the Overseas Governments as ascheme which His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to support.Report by Imperial Shipping Committee on Economic Size and Speed of Ships.50. The Committee have considered the Report (I.E.C. (23) 11) of the imperial shipping Committee on the Economic Size and Speed of vessels trading between theUnited Kingdom and Australia, and on the subsidies necessary to maintain speedsin excess of the economic speed.The Committee understand that the subject-matter of this Report has recentlybeen considered by the Cabinet (Cabinet 39 (23), Conclusion 2) in connection with proposals for the development of a commercial Airship Service, and that the cabinet had adopted the Report (C.I.D. 436-B) of the Sub-Committee of the Committeeof Imperial Defence, subject to the financial and other arrangements being settledto the satisfaction of the Treasury and the other Departments concerned. TheCabinet has also directed that when the announcement of this decision is made itshould be stated that the decision had been taken after full consideration, not only of the Report of the Committee of Imperial Defence, but also of the Report of theImperial Shipping Committee, and that the Government have been greatly influenced by the importance, in the interests of Imperial trade and communications, of giving effect as far as possible to the recommendations of the latter Committee.The Committee have taken note of the Cabinet decision summarised above.Defence Aspect of Food Supplies.51. The Committee have considered a Memorandum (I.E.C. (B Series) XXI)on the Defence Aspect of Food Supplies, prepared by the Inter-DepartmentalCommittee. The Inter-Departmental Committee state that, after careful considera-tion, they have come to the conclusion that it is quite impossible for them to prepareany useful statement on the subject for the purpose of the Economic Conferencewithout a knowledge of Military and Naval data, which is not at their disposal.They therefore submit that the question is one with which the Committee of ImperialDefence are alone competent to deal.The Committee recommend to the Cabinet That the question of the Defence Aspect of Food Supplies is not one forconsideration by the Economic Conferei^e, but that the question shouldbe discussed, if at all, at the Imperial Conference or, in the alternative, bythe Committee of Imperial Defence, reinforced on this occasion by repre-sentative members of the Imperial Conference.The Hague Rules.52. The Committee have had under consideration a Memorandum by the Inter-Departmental Committee (I.E.C. (B Series) XXII) relative to the question whether legislation embodying the revised Hague Rules respecting the carriage of goodsby sea should be discussed at the Imperial Economic Conference. The Inter-Departmental Committee recommended that this question should remain on theAgenda for the Imperial Economic Conference, and that, if so, the MemorandumAnnex &quot; A &quot;.to I.E.C. (B Series) XXII should be transmitted to the Dominions andIndia, together with copies of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Bill and of the report thereon.by.the Joint Select Committee. iThe Committee recommend to the Cabinet -(i.) That the recommendation of the ; Inter-Departmental Committee that thequestion of legislation embodying the revised Hague Rules respecting the carriage of goods by sea should remain on the Agenda&apos;for the ImperialEconomic. Conference should be adopted; and
(ii.) That the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Secretary of State forIndia respectively should be authorised to transmit to the Dominions and&apos; - India the Memorandum Annex &quot; A &quot;to I.E.C. (B Series) XXII, togetherwith copies of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Bill, and of the report thereon by the Joint Select Committee, as proposed by the  Inter-&apos;   Departmental Committee.Extra-Territorial Powers.53. The Committee have taken note of the following expression of opinion bythe Inter-Departmental Committee on the subject of Extra-Territorial Powers on merchant Shipping Law and Administration :  &quot; If the ideal solution of the problem an Imperial Code is impracticable,&quot; it seems desirable to maintain the present position as laid down in the&quot; Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, and in the resolutions of the Conference of 1907.&quot; Recognition of extra-territorial jurisdiction on the part of Self-governing&quot; Dominions, beyond what is already implied in Imperial Acts, as indicated&quot; above, would raise difficult questions of conflict of jurisdiction, and is very&quot; undesirable unless and until it is clear that such conflicts will not arise, i.e., by&quot; uniformity of legislation where a vessel comes under two jurisdictionsand recommend to the Cabinet That, if the question were raised by any of the Dominions at the Conference,and if in the last resort it should be found impossible to obtain an agreed solution of the shipping difficulty at the Economic Conference, the british representatives should be authorised to suggest that this question should bereferred to the Imperial Shipping Committee.Meat Supplies.54. The Committee have examined a Memorandum (I.E.C. (C Series) IX) bythe Inter-Departmental Committee on the recommendations of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Meat Supplies (Cd. Paper 456).The Committee recommend to the Cabinet That proposals for the establishment of a system of control and supervision of the meat trade such as those contemplated in the Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Meat Supplies should not be entertained.Education.55. The Committee have had before them a Memorandum (I.E.C. (B Series)IX, Annex B, page 4, paragraph 8) respecting trie proposals of Sir A. Balfour withregard to the teaching of British Empire History.The Committee recommend to&apos; the Cabinet That all practicable steps should be taken to encourage the teaching ofBritish Empire History in the schools throughout the Empire.Imperial Penny Postage.56. The Committee have had before them a Memorandum by the Inter-Departmental Committee (I.E.C. (C Series) VI), relative to the suggestedreintroduction of Imperial Penny Postage.The Committee recommend to the Cabinet (1.) That, while the question of the reintroduction of Imperial Penny Postageshould not be placed on the Agenda of the Imperial Economic Conference,some reference should be made to the question in the general statement tobe made at the opening of the Conference.&quot;&apos; (2.) That, subject to the views of the Postmaster-General, the above reference should take the form of stating that, as soon as it is found possible toreintroduce Penny Postage in Great Britain, the concession will beextended to the Empire       whole. -;      , . ;  ,The Committee have also requested-The Board of Trade to prepare a memorandum s^t^E^gut. the objections,to the institution of uniform rates of parcel postage throughout the Empire..[10423] c 2
Deferred Rates on Telegraphic Communications.57. With regard to the question of the rates for deferred telegraph messages,the Postmaster-General has informed the Committee that the Eastern and associated companies propose, at an early date, to introduce a service of &quot; Cable Letters &quot;atone-fourth of the ordinary rates, with a minimum of twenty words per message,which will, in effect, put the whole of the Empire (except the West Indies) on the same footing as Canada in this respect. The question of applying a similar arrangement to the West Indies will be considered in connection with the new TelegraphicCommunications Scheme referred to in I.E.C. (23) 7, Section IV.The Committee recommend the Cabinet to take note of the above communication.Trade Catalogues.58. With reference to the question of the Customs treatment of TradeCatalogues, the Committee agreed That the question of the Customs treatment of Trade Catalogues should bebrought before the Economic Conference under the heading of commercial intelligence rather than of Customs Tariffs, and that an effort should bemade to induce the Dominions to follow the example of India by accordingfree admission to Trade Catalogues arriving through the post from otherparts of the Empire.Preparation of Detailed Draft Agenda.59. The Committee recommend to the Cabinet. -That the President of the Board of Trade should be authorised to prepare a detailed draft Agenda for the Economic Conference.Arrangements for the Conference.60. With regard to the arrangements for the Economic Conference, theCommittee recommend to the Cabinet (1.) That the proceedings of the Economic Conference should open with ageneral statement of the Imperial economic situation on lines similar tothe statement on Imperial policy to be made at the opening of the ImperialConference.(2.) That all documents required by Ministers for the purpose of the EconomicConference should be printed, even if, as seems improbable, such printingnecessitates a Supplementary Estimate.(3.) That the President of the Board of Trade should be authorised to arrangefor the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Commerce of: NorthernIreland to be present at the Imperial Economic Conference as an adviser;. to the President of the Board of Trade, but not to take part in the deliberations of the Conference.Empire Currency.61. The Committee have taken note of Memoranda (I.E.C. (C Series) 1and Ia) which have been prepared by the Treasury in connection with the proposals submitted by Mr. J. F. Darling for unifying the currencies of the British Empire.Documents transmitted to the Dominions.62. The Committee report that, after consideration, they have authorised thedespatch to the Dominions and India of the following documents : Subject.

APPENDIX II.Imperial Economic Conference.Summary of the Committee&apos;s Recommendations in favour of New or increased Preferences.I. General Recommendations.1. That the general line to the taken should be that in order to encourage thedevelopment of Empire settlement and the granting of Dominion preference toBritish goods, as well as with a view to the alleviation of unemployment at home, theBritish Government should endeavour to give as extensive further preferences asmay be possible without violation of the Ministerial pledges.2. That any concession made should be granted generally to the whole Empire,and should not be the subject of separate Dominion agreements.*3. That a total remission of the duty on certain Empire products is not inconsistent with the Ministerial pledges.4. That the imposition of any new or increased duty on food should be conditional on an adjustment being made in respect of other duties on food, so as tosecure that food taxation should not be increased in the aggregate.[See Report, paragraph 8.]II. Increases of Existing Preferences.1. Dried Fruits.(i.) Currants. That in the event of the question of an increased preference oncurrants being raised at the Imperial Economic Conference, the representatives ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government should have a free hand to deal with the Australiandemand on its merits, within the limits of the proposal which has been underconsideration by the Committee, namely, an increase of the duty on foreign currantsfrom 2s. to a rate not exceeding 10s. Qd. per cwt. with complete exemption for Empirecurrants. They should, at the same time, be requested to bear in mind the importanceof so timing and presenting any consequential proposals to Greece as to minimise thepolitical and economic disadvantages apprehended by the Foreign Office.(ii.) Other Dried Fruits. (a.) That an extension of the existing tariff rate tocertain classes of dried fruits which are at present duty free would not be inconsistent with Ministerial pledges, and should be conceded if pressed for by the Dominions.(b.) That dried fruits of Empire production should be admitted free of duty toGreat Britain.see Report, p    graphs 10-13.]2. Preserved Fruits and Jams.(i.) That authority should be given to the representatives of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment at the Imperial Economic Conference to propose: (a.) That a duty of 5s. per cwt., in addition to the existing duty on sugar (ifany), used in preserving should be imposed on foreign-preserved apples,pears, pineapples, peaches, apricots and nectarines. Other preservedfruits could be added to the list hereafter should the Dominions so wish.(b.) That Empire preserved fruits should be exempt from this new duty.(ii.) That no proposal should be entertained for extending the duty to fruitpulp.[See Report, paragraphs 14-17.13. Sugar. ,.That the representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Government at the Imperial EconomicConference should be authorised to propose that a preference of art amount not lessthan the present amount, viz., approximately \d. a lb:, should be given for a periodof ten years on all Empire sugar imported into Great Britain.[See Report, paragraphs 18-20.]...... * An exception to this general rule will be found in the case of tobacco, see below.

The encouragement of Imperial development by various means is the main purpose of the Economic Conference. In the original telegram of invitation it was stated that the general reference to the Conference would be &quot;to study the&quot;possibilities of co-operation in the development of the resources of the British&quot; Empire, and the strengthening of economic relations between its constituent&quot;parts.&quot;2. On the question of policy involved, the President of the Board of Trade, onbehalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government, stated, in the House of Commons on the10th April, that His Majesty&apos;s Government would take up at the ImperialConference the whole question of co-operation with the Dominions and with theState Governments of the Dominions as to the development of their resources. he observed that all those who entered into that Conference would go into it, so far asthe circumstances of the individual State permitted, with the common object, whetherby preference or by financial co-operation, to develop their mutual resources to thebest advantage. We should consider how best we could use our credit in order thatwe and the Dominions may co-operate in schemes to our common advantage.Speaking of the Crown Colonies, the President referred to the desirability of using British credit to enable Colonial development of a revenue-producing character to be anticipated so that orders may be placed in. this country during the presentperiod of unemployment.. He added that the Government would ask the authority ofthe House to make the necessary advances so soon as the schemes were ready for whichthese advances are.needed. :&apos;    ; .. .: 3. The subject of Imperial development is, of course, to some extent covered bythe memoranda on Oversea Settlement and Imperial Preference.   It is, however
essential to explore the further question, how far any scheme of direct financialco-operation is practicable for the encouragement of forms of development; which areof special value from an Imperial point of view. The schemes in question are thosewhich serve not only to promote local development or the settlement of population inone particular part of the Empire, but also to give direct encouragement to the trade of another part of the Empire, so that two or more different Governments are directly interested in their practical realisation and may reasonably co-operate for thepurpose. The present memorandum is an attempt to give some answer to thisquestion on the basis of the policy announced on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s government by the President of the Board of Trade.4. It is presumed that the word &quot; co-operation &quot; was used advisedly in the telegram of invitation with a view to limiting the purview of the Conference to schemes involving direct co-operation between two or more Governments.. To includeforms of assistance which do not involve such co-operation would unnecessarily widen the scope of the discussion, and there seems no ground for bringing before theImperial Economic Conference matters such as the Export Credits Scheme or theTrade Facilities Act, which only involve action by, and in the interest of, the UnitedKingdom, although such action sometimes takes the form of assistance to projects inthe Oversea parts of the Empire.5. We may also, for practical purposes, rule out schemes which are of a natureonly to benefit a particular locality, and which only interest other parts of the Empirefrom the point of view of the general Imperial sentiment.. It seems very unlikelythat any Government of the Empire will put up money in the form of grants orguarantees for purposes which offer no prospect of direct benefit to^ the development;trade or population of that part of the Empire. We may, therefore, postulatemutuality of direct advantage as the second essential condition ..6. Following from the last stated condition, we may further limit the problem by excluding co-operation in financial assistance to oversea industries of a kind whichwould compete injuriously with home industries. It would be difficult to. defend tothe taxpayer the use of his money or credit to foster direct competition with his owntrade. It may in practice be found that insistence on this condition will, in effect,limit the scope of development schemes to be assisted to what are generally known as public Utility Undertakings, including communications, power lighting, waterirrigation, drainage, land settlement and kindred purposes. Assistance to&apos; some ofthese classes of undertakings might possibly be represented as a subsidy to overseaagriculture and competition with the British farmer, but it is thought that in thesecases the subsidy is too indirect to justify the exclusion of such schemes from consideration on their merits.7. The next question which arises is whether the schemes to be assisted must be publicly managed, or whether privately managed undertakings may be included. Itappears highly desirable not to exclude private enterprises provided that they fall within the category of Public Utility Undertakings. (It is understood that theColonial Office have some doubt whether schemes in the Crown Colonies should notbe limited to publicly managed concerns, and should they press for this limitation itwill be for Ministers to decide the question of policy raised.)8. Though in the above observations the general expression &quot; co-operation&quot; between two or more Governments &quot; has been used, it will in practice be found thatone party to the co-operation will almost invariably be the&apos; United Kingdom, whosecredit will be used to promote the development of the resources of some overseadominion or colony. We have, therefore, to contemplate not a general multi-lateralscheme of mutual guarantee to be subscribed by all the Governments of the Empire &apos;a proposition which would probably not be looked upon with favour but rather a series of bi-lateral agreements between the United Kingdom and particularDominions and Colonies with a view to co-operation in particular schemes ofdevelopment.9. According to the conditions laid down above, each of these bi-lateral schemesmust be of a mutual character both in respect of contributions and of benefit.Broadly speaking, the contribution of the United Kingdom will be the use of itsfunds and credit, and the immediate advantage to be repaid by the United kingdom will be the additional employment afforded to our population from, the orders placedin the United Kingdom in connection with the scheme, together with the openingsafforded for overseas settlement: It, therefore, seems essential to stipulate that acertain proportion of the capital raised with Imperial assistance should be expendedin the United Kingdom on products of British manufacture, or (alternatively) that[10423-] d
the authority which deals with these proposals and settles) the terms of the schemes should not impose conditions as to repayment which are sufficiently drastic to makethe scheme inoperative for the main purposes for which it is intended.This observation seems necessary because experience shows that a Committeeof expert business men set up to advise His Majesty&apos;s Government on a matterinvolving the expenditure of public money has a natural tendency, unless expresslyinstructed to the contrary, to apply ordinary business standards to the schemes submitted to them. In the present case it is presumed that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment would not wish to regard the advances made for the assistance of overseadevelopment as a strictly commercial investment, but will rather look to theadvantages to be obtained by the reduction of unemployment, the encouragement oftrade and the oversea settlement of population.15. Lastly, there is the important question of the limit of financial commitmentsunder any schemes of this kind, and also of the limit of the period during whichguarantees or advances should be given. These are matters for Ministers, but thelimits of  2,000,000 in any one year and a period of 15 years are tentativelysuggested for consideration.An outline scheme, embodying the above points is annexed so as to facilitatediscussion. ,Annex.Tentative Draft Scheme. - ,1. The Undertakings which may benefit from the scheme are Undertakingswithin the British Empire, but outside the United Kingdom for purposes of PublicUtility (viz., Communications, power, lighting, water, drainage, irrigation, landsettlement, and other kindred purposes).These Undertakings may be either under public or private control ormanagement.2. The assistance to be given will (generally speaking) take the form of annualadvances to the Undertaking of the whole or part of the interest on capital requiredfor new construction or development, payable for a period of not more than [ten]years. Any advance so made shall be a debt from the Undertaking, and shall berepayable out of profits or net revenue in accordance with terms to be settled ineach case by the agreement under which the advance is made.Alternatively, the assistance may take the form of a guarantee of interest fora period of not more than [ten] years, or (in the exceptional cases referred to inparagraph 8) of a direct advance of capital.3. The proportions in which any two co-operating Governments shall share thecost of assistance in any particular case shall (subject to paragraph 6) be decided by agreement between them, having regard to the circumstances.4. Each Dominion or Colonial Government participating in the scheme shall make arrangements to receive and examine propositions with regard to existing orproposed Undertakings within its territories, and transmit them if approved to theUnited Kingdom Government, with an accompanying report stating how far theDominion or Colonial Government is prepared to share in any financial assistance that may be accorded.5. The appropriate United Kingdom Authority shall consider the applicationso transmitted, and may enter into direct communication so far as necessary withrepresentatives of the Dominion or Colonial Government or of the Undertaking, andif it decides to proceed with the proposal, shall frame a draft agreement for approval by the two Governments.6. His Majesty&apos;s Government will be prepared to consider propositionssubmitted in accordance with the above scheme provided that the total expenditurefalling on the United Kingdom in any one year shall not exceed  2,000,000.7. It will be a condition of any assistance from His Majesty&apos;s Government thata stipulated proportion of the capital raised with their assistance- or of that partof this capital which is not expended locally shall be expended on machinery, plant,&quot;materials, &amp;c, manufactured or produced in the United Kingdom. . 1    .8. His Majesty&apos;s Government shall have the option in any particular case ofa Colonial Undertaking in which the sum involved is comparatively small to substitute for the assistance contemplated under the above provisions a direct loan
of capital on which the whole.or part of the, interest during the period of assistanceshall be deferred.9. The scheme shall remain in force for a period of fifteen years.10&apos; References in this memorandum to; &quot;Dominions &quot;apply equally to India.Board of.

Following is general indication of lines on which His Majesty&quot;s Government, subject to results of discussion at Economic Conference, will be prepared to consider schemes of financial co-operation which may be proposed with view to assisting early development of Public utility undertakings in Dominions, * which without such assistance would be delayed ornot proceeded with. Undertakings assisted should be of nature which, if put inhand rapidly, would confer direct benefit both on Dominions* and on employment by placing of orders in United Kingdom. Conditions and limits of financialassistance and shares, of co-operating Governments in such assistance would besettled in each case by special agreement. Without excluding from considerationany form of assistance, His Majesty&apos;s Government consider guarantee of interest or advance of part of interest for limited period is likely to. prove the most generallyuseful method. Specific Proposals under an agreed general scheme would naturally be examined carefully by competent authorities both in Dominions* and UnitedKingdom before approval.In case ol India substitute &quot;India &quot; for &quot; Dominions.&apos;
