There was a risk.that the moregrudging &quot;attitude of the covering note mightinterfere with the good, impression which thedraft note to Germany was otherwise likelyto produce.    It was therefore felt to be important to amend the covering note, notonly because of the Immediate impressionit might produce on the French Government,but also in order that, if it. were eventuallypublished, it might make a favourable andconciliatory impression on French, no lessthan on British and world public opinion.The following more detailed suggestions were,for the most part, based on this considerar-tion:-Page I, line 5:    For the words &quot;independent enquiry&quot; substitute the words used in theGerman Note, &quot;an impartial international tribunal&quot; . ... &apos; - .Page lf  line 80: A proposal was made to omit the whole passage after &quot;proposals&quot; down tothe word &quot;success&quot; on page 3, line 7.

RET APPENDIX.&quot;    ^    &apos; (CIRCULATED TO THE CABINET).Draft covering Note to the French. Italian. Belgianfind Japanege Ambassadors..FOREIGN OFFICE.,July        1933.Your Excellency: -It is now seven weeks since the German Governmentin their note of June 7th submitted to the Powers freshproposals for settling the problem of reparations.   Themain points in the note were threes- (1)   A proposal tosubmit to Independent enquiry the question of Germany&apos;a capacity to pay, coupled with an undertaking to accept any decision so reached as regards both the amount and themode of payment;    (ft)   the assignment, of certain specifiedguarantees as securities for payment;    and (o) the summoning of&amp; conference in order to work out a detailed scheme.His Majesty&apos;a Government were from the start ofopinion that, whether these proposals were adequate or not,they were at least deserving of careful consideration andwere entitled to the courtesy of a reply.     Thia view was concurred in by the Italian Government;    but the Frenchand the Belgian Governments expressed the view that, onlysifter passive resistance, had been definitely abandoned byGermany, would it be possible to consider her proposals.In their anxiety to ascertain the precise meaning to beattached to this condition,  a number of questions were addressedto the French and Belgian governments by His Majesty&apos;aGovernment with regard both to the action which the GermanGovernment
- - Government was invited to take and to the future positionin the Ruhr, if and when it should have been taken.   the replies that have been returnedjto,these questions have$ not completely lifted the veil of uncertainty in whichthe situation i.s still in parts involved.In the meantime the question of reparations remains in suspense, and while reasons for inaction or for refusal to take any action but that which commends itself to this or that Power abound, the international situation becomesweekly and indeed daily more acute;    the occupation of the ruhr, whether justified or not in its concept ion,,-fifrllato produce the desired effect;    allied unity on anyadequate scale is strained;   payments by Germany are not forthcoming.     Moreover the steady deterioration of german currency renders it increasingly difficult, if not impossible,for her to meet her liabilities under the Schedule of pay-ments fixed in May 1921.     It ia not denied that german policy has contributed largely to create this situation.But it is with the results even more than with the oausesthat. we tire now concerned, and it la to these that HisMajesty&apos;s Government venture to direct the attention oftheir allies.The view was put forward by His Majesty1s government at the Paris conference in January last and is still held by them that in order to obtain from Germany thepayments which the allies are entitled to receive, Germancredit must be re-established,     German currency must be stabilised, the German budget must ea balanced and German-productivity must be encouraged.     Aa long as themost
moat, highly developed area of German industrial liferemains under military rule, and is made the scene a political agitation, it is difficult to see how theeconomic problem.can he solved.    It may be possible tobreak Germany1s power of resistance by such means;, but itwill be at the price of, that very recovery upon which theallied policy depends for its ultimate success.that1% it be the case /the so-called passive resistance of Germany is the main obstacle that stands In theway of Ihat consummation, and if its abandonment willbe the first step towards a positive advance, HisMaiestyrs Government are quite prepared t* join their .allies in, pressing such a policy, as indeed,they have,already pressed it upon the German government, and in.theproposed draft of a joint allied reply to the German note of June 7th which they have the honour herewith to submit the suggestion has been definitely put forward.   But ifthis plan is to be pursued with real hope of sucoess, itwould appear that two conditions will require to be aimul-taneously satisfied.    The first is that a renewed and serious attempt should be made to deal with the questionof reparations by determining, not the liability ofGermany - for. that has already been laid down - but hercapacity to pay.,   The second is that proposals shouldbe made for the restoration of the Ruhr to that condition which will enable it to become an area of fruitful pro-duction, rather than one of international strife.As regards the first of these steps, it will be  ,acknowledged that the reparation figure laid down in1921 no longer corresponds to ttie realities of the situa-tion.    fresh calculations must soonercr\later be made.
It is Sn the &quot;best interest of the allies that,whatever figure he finally - decided upon, It should be freely accepted by the German government as juat andrealisable,    Furthermore the situation is likely not trtgrow better, but to become worse with delay.   A recurrenceto procedure by ultimata     may indeed produce tardy andreluctant capitulation.    It fails to produce substantial.,deliveries either in cash or kind.The German government have proposed in their,recent note to allow Germany1s capacity to pay, as weklas the mode of payment, to be Investigated by an impartialbody. - In the draft reply which is enclosed herewith wehave pointed out that such a procedure does not necessarilyconflict with any - provisions of the Treaty of Versailles.Under Article 234, a reduction of the total amount declared by the Reparation Commission to be payable by Germany can.be made, if explicitly:; authorised by the several govern-ments represented on the Commission.    These is nothing to prevent those governments, or the Separation Commissionon which they are represented, from calling intocouncil such impartial and expert assistance as theymay desire.    Fortified by such authority,  the Commissionand the governments would be in a position to demand from&amp;he German government, who under  the terms of the treaty would have had a right to be heard,  the unequivocalfulfilment of the undertaking contained in the german note.
As to the composition of such en enquiry, this isa matter which could well he determined by the AlliedGovernments In consultation,     There should he no diff1-.culty in agreeing upon a selection of competent personsenjoying their confidence, as well as that of thepublic     Further, having regard to the Important in-terest which American finance is bound to take in anycomprehensive plan of settlement, the advantage of american co-operation, whether in an official or in an unofficial capacity, scarcely requires emphasis, and isconfidently recommended by.HIs Majestyrs Government toher Allies,Should His Majesty&apos;s Government be so fortunateas to carry with them the assent of their Allies thusfar, they will be ready without delay to enter into amore detailed discussion of the precise steps to besuccessively taken In order to carry out this plan ofaction.     In such a discussion the question of Inter-Allied indebtedness will necessarily occupy a prominentplace, end will be approached by His Majesty&apos;e Govern-ment in the spirit of generosity which has inspiredtheir previous proposals In this direction.     They onlyshrink from submitting more definite proposals nowbecause experience has shown that hsrd and fast schemes are apt to impede rather than to promote a generalagreement.There r erne ins the question, should the Gorman goverh-ment accept the advice with regard to cessationfrom passive resistance which it is proposed to tender
ion2 d ito them, of the future position in. the Ruhr,     HisMajesty&apos;s Government believe that the French and belgian Governments will be the first to agree that theoharacter of the occupation, should in those circum-starces undergo a swift and material change5    that thenumbers of the military forces stationed in the Ruhrand. at other places occupied since January last shouldbe reduced as rapidly as possible to the minimum required, to protect the civilian officials who may forsome time be obliged to stay in that region in orderto control the proper administration of the pledgesand guarantees which Germany will have given;    and thatassurances of ultimate and complete evacuation, whenthe necessary conditions have been fulfilled, shouldnot be withheld0     Simultaneously the various measures that have been promulgated, in the name of the Rhine-land Commission for coercing the civil population andimpeding the free movement of persons and goods would doubtless be either cancelled or relaxed;    as generousan amnesty as possible would be accorded; and the re-turn of the expelled population and functionaries wouldbe facilitated under suitable guarantees.It has net been thought either necessary or-desirable to include in the draft reply to the GermanGovernment the more precise indications which are coh-tained in this despatch.     Attaching, as they do, thehighest importance to the maintenance of Allied unity and convinced that only by such means will an earlysolution of the international problem be found, Hisa w /Majesty&apos;s
Majesty1s Government have drawn up the draft reply in a spirit and in terms which they trust may be acceptable to their Allies.They will-, of course, be glad to consider any suggestions or emendations which any of the latter may think fit to propose consistently with the main linesof policy which it has been, the aim of His majesty&apos;s government to expound and to defend.Should the Llote meet with general favour, therewould appear to be manifest advantages in its earlydespatch.The present communication&apos;, addressed to the Alliesalone, has been added in order to acquaint them in greater detail with the plans which His Majesty ls Gov-emment hope to be permitted to pursue in conjunctionwith them, and which may be thus resumed.(1)   A body of impartial experts to be set up, so     -soon -as passive resistaaice has ceased^ charged with theduty of advising the Allied governments and the separation Commission respectively as to Germany&quot;bc-.paci.ty to pay rand as to the mode of pcyment to be -pre--scribed.      The co-operation of an American expert tobe sought, and arrangements- to be made for German experts to be consulted and heard..(2)      The sane body, or a body similarly constitutedto be asked to advise the Separation Commission asto the economic sureties and r-;urrantees - to be pledged byGermany &apos;to the Allies. X: (3)
(3)    Inter-Allied discussions to be opened withas little delay as possible whether by conference orotherwise, for the purpose of elaborating a comprehensive plan of a general said final financial settlement,covering the whole field both of reparations and of &apos;i; .....Inter-Allied Indebtedness.(4) Steps to be taken upon the cessation ofpassive resistance for the resumption of the civil administration of the Ruhr, and to provide for the progressive evacuation of those areas.(5)    So soon as agreement has been reached as tothe new economic sureties and guarantees &quot;to be pledged to the Allies, and those guarantees have been put intooperation, the occupation of all German territory out-side the limits laid down in the Treaty of Versailles,to come to an end.His Majesty^ Government venture to submit theforegoing proposals to their Allies with the convictionthft in the common interest positive action can nolonger safely be delayed, and in the hope that theyhelp tomay/facilitate a definite advmce.I ami, &amp;o. ,(Signed) CURZOU OP KEDLESTON.
TRIET I3EBTIC REPLY TO  &apos;iHE GERMAN BOVBRKMEMT. -On May 2nd the German Government, in response tosuggestions that had been made, addressed an identic note to the governments of the United State of America, Belgium,France,  Great Britain,  Italy, and Japan, containing certain proposals for a settlement of the question of reparations.To this note separate replies were returned by &apos;the French and Belgian governments, acting in unlson9 -and by the Italian, British and Japanese governments,acting separately.      These replies concurred, .however, .in regarding the German proposals as inacceptable, themain criticism directed against them being that neitherthe total amounts suggested as payable for reparation,nor the mode of payment, nor the guarantees offered,were at all adequate, while settlement of any kind wasmade contingent on the evacuation of the Ruhr, pendingwhich passive resistance by the Germans was not to berenounced,The unfavourable reception accorded to theseproposals having led the German government to reconsiderits attitude,  that government on June 7th addressed asecond communication to the same powers..In this memorandum the German government, affirmingonoe again its determination to discharge its reparationdebt, repeated a proposal which it had before made, torefer to an impartial international tribunal the questionboth of the amount and the methods of payment, undertook to furnish such a body with all possible information and-.9- assistance,.
a^aiiSttwK)^ ^XJa..^o^rr^.^rtlrJf&apos; ^^^Jarr&amp;trtijra-tLeri, -anth^ro-misca to accept the decision at which it night, arrive,-Further, the German - govcrrtrnerit proposed certainguarantees or sureties for the regular payment of the liabilities thus fixed, Involving, though, this wasnot explicitly stated,  the grant of a moratorium of four years from the present date.Finally, the Gorman government suggested aconference at which Germany, might be assisted byoral discussion in arriving at a solution of allthese questions,The German note did not on this occasion containany reference to Hie subject of passive resistance^not, it is presumed, from any failure to appreciateits peculiar importance, but because that topic hadnot been mentioned in all of the replies of theallied governments to which  the note was intended asan answer,The allied governments, anxious to terminate the phase equally of paper controversy and of inter-national complication, will now give their views uponeach of these matters,In the treaty of Versailles, it was recognised by the allied and associated governments that, whileaffirming the full responsibility of Germany forall the loss and damage which thev had suffered ather hands during the war, they could not,; in view ofher diminished resources, expect to receive from her complete reparation for all such-loss and damage.In other words,   the necessity was admitted even atthat -date of adjusting the liability of Germany toher ...
her capacity to pay, &apos;In May, 1921, the- amount of reparation was fixed by the Reparation Commission at 132 milliards of gold,marks.   No power was. given by the treaty to cancelany part of that obligation, except with the specificauthority cf the several governments represented onthe Commission..     If therefore the contention is now put forward that owing to the altered circumstancesof today the figure of - 1921 is too high a.nd calls-,for reduction, it can only be by action within tho -framework of the treaty that such reduction can properly be made;  and it Is only from this point ofview that the allied powers are free to consider thefirst request of the German government in the notenow under reply, namely, the request for an examination,by international experts of her present capacity for-payment,The allied governments are far from thinking thatthey might not be assisted-in&apos;the task devolved upon them by the treaty by the labours of competent and impartial experts; and provided that nothing is doneIn this respect that is inconsistent with the treatystipulations, they are disposed to think that positive advantage might result from such an e xamination,    Itwould bring the allegations of diminished capacity tothe test ef fact;    it would reveal the a ctual position:&apos;&apos;at the present moment;    and it would remove all further&quot;&apos;excuse for calculated evasion,The,., ,,
The Allied. Governments take note of the statement bythe Gorman government that it would Wwlcomc such an enquiry,, and of its pledge to abide by the. result.... ;&quot;If a binding arrangement were entered into,, concerningthe discharge of the entire liability, as thus determined,,.and as to the sureties to be taken for the regular and complete payment of the total debt,, the case for a furthermoratorium would emerge in a new perspective.As to the sureties themselves,, the Allied govern-ments,&apos; while appreciating the effort of the Germangovernment to advance boyorid the vague indications ofthe earlier note of May 2nd,, must guard themselves fromaccepting these new proposals as adequately, or in thebest possible way meeting the actual requirements of thesituation..      Their economic value must largely depend upon factors of which-no mention is made in the german note, such as the stabilization of the mark and thebalancing of the German budget.     A careful examination ofanthese, or other supplementary guarantees, will be/inseparablefeature of the enquiry which the Allied governments areprepared within- the limits of the. Treaty to initiate.*t must be clear,, however, that no guarantees forthe punctual discharge of accepted liabilities will suffice,, unless provision is at the same.time made forsome. form, of International control of German financialadministration.&apos;. .     This is one &apos; of the; subjects towhich it will be necessary to invite the. seriousattention of the German government,    and without asettlement 0,
settlement of which, no final solution can be obtained.When tho German Government pleads for oral discussionof all these matters,  it may bo romembored that, undor theTreaty,  tho Reparation Commission while authorised from, timeto time to consider the resources and capacity of Germany,is also under an obligation &quot;to givo to the German government an opportunity to be heard,&quot;     It is not likely therefore thatthe German case will suffer from lack of suitable ex-position.Such is the reply of the Allied Governments to the mainpropositions of the German iToto.     There remains, however,  one important consideration which is tho antecedent condition toa willingness on the part of the Allies to. reopen thequestions to which roference has been made.       The occupation&apos;of tho Ruhr valley by the armed forces of certain of the Allieshas been followed by measures deliberately taken by theGerman government to impede this policy and to delay thepayment of reparations.     These measures may be summed upin the familiar, phrase &quot;passive resistance&quot; .     If the Germangovernment now desires a resumption of enquiry, it will,  inthe opinion of the Allied Governments, be well advised towithdraw without further delay the ordinances and decreeswhich have organised and fomented this form of resistance,and openly and unequivocally to disavow the acts of violence and sabotage which have in some oases accompanied it.Were this action to be taken without delay, not only would it be regarded as an evidence of that good faith whichthe German Government has once again avowed, but it would render possible a reconsideration by tho occupying powers ofthe conditions of their occupation, and a gradual return to thenormal features of industrial life in the Ruhr,     Such areversion....,T %
reversion would possess the additional advantage thait. by ro-establishing the productive activity of that region, it woulonable tho German government core speedily and more effectivto discharge its reparation debt..In making this roply to the German note:, theAllied Governments havo olearly demonstrated their earnestdesire for the cessation of conflict and the pacification ofEurope.      In return they feel that thoy have tho right to invite the co-operation of the Gorman government in theexecution of this policy; and thoy havo indicated with asmuch precision as is possiblo at the present stage the reciprocal st$ps by which each party can effectivelycontribute to the dosired result,14.
