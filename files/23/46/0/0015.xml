Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   July 1923.1 0 3x &amp; %iSECRET.N.B. 65.COMMITTEE   OF   IMPERIAL   DEFENCE.NATIONAL AND  IMPERIAL  DEFENCE  COMMITTEE!Memorandum covering the Report of the Special Sub-Committee on theRelations of the Navy and the Air Force.THE Main Committee observe that the Special Sub-Committee^are not altogethersatisfied with the term &quot; Seconded which they have used in describing the status of Naval officers serving in the Fleet Air Arm. It is clear that the actual positionof a Naval officer seconded to the Air Service afloat differs from a seconded officeras hitherto understood. For example, he continues to be under the ultimate tacticaland disciplinary orders at sea of an officer of the Service to which he permanentlybelongs, whilst he is serving under the immediate command of an officer of theService to which he is temporarily attached. Moreover, the work he is called onto do in his temporary Service directly relates to the needs of his parent Service,and he carries it out under the eyes of&apos; a commanding officer of his parent Service.The Main Committee therefore consider the term &apos; Seconded &apos;&apos; not altogetherappropriate. They would prefer the more general term &quot;Attached,&quot; provided theconditions of attachment necessary in this particular case are clearly understood,as follows : The Fleet Air Arm is to form part of the Air Service, and these naval officers belonging to the Fleet Air Arm are therefore to be attached to the AirService. But whilst after their training under the Air Service they will be posted to units of the Navy by the Air Service and will serve under the immediate command of Air Service officers, yet afloat they will be under the ultimate command of theNaval officers of the Fleet. Though their temporary pay and their acting rank willbe determined by the Air Service, yet their permanent rank and promotion willcontinue to be subject to the regulations of the Navy. Lastly, though they must servewith the Air Service and not be moved from it during the period of their attachmentwithout the consent of the Air Ministry, yet as regards discipline and status afloatthey will in all respects be in precisely the same position as officers of the royal marines.&quot;With regard to uniform, the officers and men generally of the Fleet Air Armwill wear a distinguishing badge on their uniform. If the Admiralty desire, theNaval officers attached to the Fleet Air Arm will retain their Naval uniform withthe same badge.If any Naval other ranks and ratings are employed in the Fleet Air Arm, thesame principle as regards uniform and badges would apply.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.

SECRET.N.D. 60.(Also N.D. (R) 20.)COMMITTEE  OF  IMPERIAL DEFENCE.NATIONAL AND IMPEEIAL DEFENCE COMMITTEE.Sub-Committee on Relations between the Navy and the Air Force.REPORT.Contents.Part    I. The General Problem ...Part II. The Present SystemPart III. Recommendations       ...PART I.The General Problem.1. YOUR Sub-Committee were instructed to enquire into the relations of theNavy and the Air Force as regards the control of Fleet air work, and on this point theyhave taken a great deal of evidence from witnesses representing both Departments.In addition to this, two of our members, Lord Peel and Lord Weir, accompaniedby Sir Maurice Hankey (Secretary), paid a visit to the aerodromes in the neighbourhoodof Portsmouth and the Aircraft Carriers &quot;Argus&quot; and &quot;Eagle.&quot;2. In the course of the somewhat acute controversy between the two Departments,,a very large number of points have been raised whose importance is subsidiary andillustrative. This was inevitable, and probably desirable; but the broad principleslying at the root of the policies respectively advocated by the contending parties areperfectly intelligible, quite apart from the detailed arguments and counter argumentsby which they are supported.3. To the Air Ministry was given in 1917 control over the air forces of the country.The Department was at one stroke placed on a par with the Admiralty and the WarOffice, for, though aerial warfare is a growth of yesterday, it was felt that its rapidly increasing importance required an organisation which would ensure its development,under the most favourable conditions. In these circumstances it was only natural thatthe Air Ministry should strongly object to being partially dismembered so soon after ithad been brought into existence, the more so as in the early days of this dispute the severance of the Fleet Air Arm from the rest of the Air Force meant an immenselylarger proportionate loss than it would mean at the present moment. But though the injury involved in the complete removal from their jurisdiction of the Fleet Air Arm is relatively diminished, it remains in principle the same, and if carried out to its logicalconclusions would, in the opinion of the Department, lead to many administrative difficulties and much overlapping, while in the region of supply and research it wouldhamper progress and increase, expense.[10370] - ePag-e124
4. The Admiralty case is not less worthy of most serious consideration. In their view a Fleet Air Arm is now as necessary to a Fleet as cruisers, destroyers orsubmarines. Aerial reconnaissance and aerial &quot;spotting&quot; are as strictly navalations as gunnery, torpedo work and wireless telegraphy. It seems to themintolerable that, while they are responsible for the safety and success of our BattleFleets, the air work on which that safety and that success in large measure dependshould be performed by persons belonging to another Service, imbued by differenttraditions, and looking for sujDport and promotion to a different Department.5. Your Sub-Committee have the greatest sympathy with both these points ofview, and they have given much anxious thought to the question of how they can best be dealt with. They do not think that the present system can remain altogetherunchanged; neither do they think it possible to sever completely the Air organisation which does work for the Fleet from the Air organisation which is responsible for HomeDefence against air attack and for co-operating with the Army in other theatres of operation. A course somewhere between these two extremes is the one we recommend,but before describing our suggestions in detail it seems desirable to give a brief sketchof the system now in course of development along the line where the two Servicescome intc contact.PART II.The Present System.The General System6. The general systemus that the Air Ministry raises, trains and maintains theFleet Air Arm. At sea the Fleet Air Arm comes under the operational and disciplinarycontrol of the Admiralty, which, designs, builds and maintains the carriers.The functions of the Fleet Air Arm comprise aerial reconnaissance, naval gunnery,spotting, bombing and fighting.The Fleet Air Arm operates at sea from a carrier, which is a floating aerodromeIn addition, in time of war, capital ships and cruisers will embark aeroplanes, but atpresent the risk to personnel and materiel is too great to justify this in time of peace.Air Force squadrons also operate over sea from shore bases in co-operation withthe Navy, but these are not at present in question.The numbers of the Royal Air Force personnel at present employed with the fleet air Arm are 115 officers and 681 other ranks.Policy7. Naval Air policy is concerted by the Air Staff and&apos; Admiralty War Staff.Initiative may come from either side, but Naval officers of high rank do not, under thepresent system, have many opportunities of obtaining experience or training in airmatters to fit them for this work.The Coastal Area8. Apart from matters of policy, liaison is secured between the Navy and the AirForce by a special machinery termed the &quot;Coastal Area&quot; Organisation. This isprovided by the Air Ministry for the purpose of administering the Fleet Air Arm ouland, subject to the general control of the Air Ministry. The Coastal Area is com-manded by a senior Air Force Officer (the present occupant is an ex-naval officer) whois responsible for the maintenance at full strength of the personnel and materiel of theFleet Air Arm, and for its special training for naval purposes. He is the adviser to theAdmiralty on Air matters other than policy, and communicates directly with the Com-mander-in-Chief, Atlantic Fleet, on all matters connected with the Fleet&apos;s requirements.9. Under the Air Officer Commanding the Coastal Area are two Group Captains,with headquarters at Leuchars (the Forth) and Lee-on-Solent respectively. In thecase of larger operations involving the embarkation of aircraft or the carrying out of operations from shore bases, the Naval Commander-in-Chief notifies his requirementsdirect to the Air Officer Commanding Coastal Area. For minor operations he dealsdirectly with one or other of the Group Captains.10. Corresponding arrangements are made at Malta for the Mediterranean Fleet.
Position on Board Carriers11. As soon as the Air Units are on board the carriers they come under the orders of the naval Commander-in-Chief, and are altogether outside the control of the CoastalArea Organisation, which is then, as we have already noted, only responsible for keepingunits up to strength in air personnel and materiel. The orders for flying are given bythe naval Commander-in-Chief (who has an Air Force Officer on his Staff) to the captain of the Aircraft Carrier, who is, of course, a naval officer, and he gives his orders to the senior Air Force Officer on board. The Royal Air Force personnel are responsiblefor the cleanliness and maintenance of their own quarters and some other parts of theship, such as the aeroplane deck. They can be employed on the general duties of theship. Difficulties have, however,, been made in regard to the performance of particularduties, such as the training and use of Air Force personnel for passing ammunition tothe guns.12. A certain amount of co-operation is practised between the skilled mechanicsof both Services. The Royal Air Force may, for example, utilise the services of theship&apos;s blacksmith for certain repairs to aeroplane engines, and the Royal Air Force may-undertake repairs to motor-boat engines. Such co-operation is naturally limited by the highly specialised training which is inevitable in each Service.Supply of Personnel13. The Air Ministry are responsible for the supply of officers and other ranks for duty with the Fleet Air Arm, with the exception of certain naval officers, who, aftertraining in Air Force establishments, are employed as observers in &quot; spotting &quot; machines and some naval ratings em ployed as wireless telegraph operators.14. It is of importance to note that the Royal Air Force possesses a number ofofficers who were formerly in the Royal Naval Air Service, many of whom were trainedas naval officers. The senior positions in the Fleet Air Ann are at present largelyfilled by these officers. The original intention of the Air Ministry was that, in orderto replace these, some 30 per cent, of the. officers of the Fleet Air Arm should consistof naval officers seconded for a term of years. Unfortunately, however, only a very few naval officers responded to the invitation to volunteer for this service.15. It may be worth noting that the general system for the supply of Air force officers to meet future demands is divided into two classes : (a.) Officers holding permanent Commissions, and-(b.) Officers holding short-service Commissions.16. Officers holding permanent Commissions, on leaving Cranwell, are given the choice of the particular branch in which they wish to specialise. Those selecting theNaval side will, in the first instance, do four years with the Fleet Air Arm. Theymay then serve with other branches, including courses of instruction, for a term ofyears in order to gain wider experience, but will ultimately return to the Naval sideagain. This practice will ensure that there will always be a proportion of senior officers in the Royal Air Force with Naval experience obtained in the Fleet Air Arm.17. A proportion of the officers holding short-service Commissions for five years,after receiving their initial training of one year, are posted for duty with the fleet air Arm, and do the whole of their service with that branch. On completion of theirfive years&apos; service they are posted to the Reserve for five years, when they areearmarked as reserves for the Fleet Air Arm in case of emergency.18. The Air Ministry endeavour to retain the personnel with the Fleet Air units for the normal term of service [i.e., four years), but exceptional cases arise when it isimpossible to allow them to remain for the whole of that period.Training19. The whole of the primary training of flying personnel, whether their futureWork is to be on sea or on land, is carried out by the Air Ministry. No criticisms of it have been brought to our notice, and we do not propose to refer to it again. the later and more specialised training of the Fleet Air Arm is partly conducted in the[&quot;10370J b 2
carriers and partly on land at technical schools maintained by the Air Ministry at certain naval ports. Apart from their initial training, before they are embarked, theAir Detachments of Carriers use these establishments for training, when not requiredby the Naval Commander-in-Chief for exercises. It will be seen therefore that as things are at present these establishments are used entirely for the purposes of theFleet Air Arm or for shore-based aircraft co-operating with the Navy. The Air Forcetraining schools in the Portsmouth area work in close touch with the naval gunnery (and torpedo schools. Behind the establishments devoted exclusively to training for theFleet Air Arm are a series of technical centres maintained for the Air Force as a whole,the resources of which are available for the Fleet Air Arm.Design and Research Work20. New design, experimental and research work to meet naval requirements are carried out by the Air Ministry after consultation with the Admiralty. The Admiralty,after consultation between the two Departments, put forward their suggestions as tothe types of machines which they require, and the Air Ministry design such machines,as far as is practicable from the point of view of aerodynamics and similar technicalconsideration. The Air Ministry draw up the specification of the type required, and call for designs from the trade, and the Admiralty are kept fully informed of theprogress made during the whole process and after the trials have been carried out.21. The Navy are not directly represented on the design, experimental or researchbranches at the Air Ministry, but the Air Ministry utilise the services of a certainnumber of ex-Naval officers, who have now transferred to the Air Force, in these depart-ments, and also receive reports as to defects in design and performance of machines from air Force officers serving with Fleet Air Units, thus ensuring that due weight is attachedto the user&apos;s point of view in the modification and improvement of design.22. There is also in existence an Inter-Departmental Committee called &quot; The Joint&quot; Technical Committee on Aviation Arrangements in His Majesty&apos;s Ships,&quot; which consists of representatives of the Admiralty and the Air Ministry. Its functions are to examinethe technical problems which may arise with regard to the suitability of the types of aircraft intended for embarkation on board carriers, and the modifications and improve-ments which can be effected on board the carriers themselves. It is clear from theevidence that new uses of aircraft involving possibly new types can be proposed either by the Admiralty or the Air Ministry, and that the latter give full consideration to allsuggestions which may be put forward by the Navy.The Supply of Materiel23. At present the Air Ministry are solely responsible for the supply of all materielconnected with aircraft. An establishment of the machines required for the fleet air Arm has been agreed upon between the Admiralty and the Air Ministry, and thelatter is responsible for maintaining that establishment at full strength with its correct \proportion of machines in reserve, the necessary spare parts and the various shoreorganisations required for its maintenance. This establishment is at present limited bythe number of Aircraft Carriers in commission in the Navy, but the Air Ministry havemade the necessary arrangements in their programme of construction to increase thenumber of machines up to the number which will be required when the two new aircraft Carriers &apos;are completed in 1923-24.PART III.Recommendations.24. We have endeavoured to explain, in the first place, the general nature of the objection felt by the Air Department to any important change in the existing system,and by the Admiralty to its maintenance. We have also given a full account of thesystem as it has been developed up to the present moment. We now propose to turn to the future and make certain suggestions which, as we hope, may go far to reconcile the contending parties and to make material improvements in the existing system.25. Our task is materially lightened by the fact that, in the course of discussionsbefore your Sub-Committee, a larger. measure of agreement was found possible odcertain aspects of the problem than had at one time seemed likely.
26. In the first place, it appeared that on some important points the practice,though not the written law, of the Air Department was already in conformity with the.fishes of the Admiralty. For example, the Admiralty are very desirous that theGroup Captains in contact with the Navy should be officers with experience ofthe Fleet Air Arm.Broadly speaking, the Air Ministry take the same view, and we recommend that lBtRecom-jtt be made part of the settled practice of the Air Ministry to consult with the mendation-Admiralty before such appointments are made.   We think, the same principle shouldbe extended to the Air Officer Commanding the Coast Defence Area and the SeniorAir Officer on board a carrier.27. The Admiralty desire that the Air Ministry shall provide all the materielwhich they demand. This, we believe, has always been the intention of the AirMinistry.We think it should be formally laid down, and that, in the event of the Air 2ndBeoom.Ministry for one reason or another not carrying into effect the wishes of the Admiralty, rthere shall be an appeal by either party to the Committee of Imperial Defence.28. We have no reason to believe that there ,is any fundamental difference ofopinion between the two Services with regard to certain questions of discipline, such,for example, as those which might arise when a member of the Air Force leaves theship, where he is under the command, for every purpose, of the Captain, and goes fortraining to the aerodrome, which is under the control of an officer of the Air Force.But though there are no differences of principle, there are certain obscurities which ^J^&quot;^&quot;it would be desirable to clear up, and we therefore recommend that the two departments should, in collaboration, draw up a code of regulations which would make clear therelations between them at all points where they come in contact.29. In ail the cases that we have so far enumerated there may have beenmisunderstanding, but there has not been at any time, so far as we are aware, any difference of principle.30. We now turn to a class of cases where, as a result of discussion before yourSub-Committee, the Air Department have shown a disposition to meet Admiralty views.The first of these relates to the framing of the Naval Estimates. The Admiraltydesire that, in these Estimates should be included the cost of the Fleet Air Arm.The Air   Department are of opinion that   technically this course would   be mendation!&quot;inconvenient, but have no objection to it in principle.   Your Sub-Committee are ofopinion that this question should be settled by the Treasury in consultation with thetwo Fighting Services.31. The Admiralty require that the Air Force on board ship should be completelyunder the orders of its Captain. Your Sub-Committee are of opinion that,inasmuch as all the airmen on board ship are under the Naval Discipline Act, this,in theory, is already provided for, but undoubtedly in the minds of those chiefly concerned some obscurity hangs over the subject. This, we think, should be explicitlycleared up.The position of a member of the Air Force when on board ship does not differ in ^^ation1&quot;law, and should not differ in practice, from the position of, say, a Marine.32. In order fully to carry out the policy laid down m the preceding paragraph, memdatioSwe recommend, and have reason to believe that the Air Ministry will accept theprinciple, that all reports on officers of the Fleet Air Arm, whether confidential orotherwise, should be signed by the Captain of the ship and passed through the naval commander-in-chief to the Air Officer Commanding the Coastal Area.33. A further point which should be dealt with under this heading; is one on 7th ^ec.om-1 . .     ,      a i    *    i      i i . -, &quot;       i 1*1 menaation.winch the Admiralty have expressed considerable anxiety and on which we have reason1&apos;t) believe that the Air Force are prepared to meet their wishes. The Admiralty areapprehensive lest, in time of war or other emergency, the Air Ministry might withdraw1 from the Navy units of the Fleet Air Arm, and use them for other purposes. InAspect of this we recommend that it should be definitely laid down that the personnel,Materiel and reserves of the Fleet Air Arm should not be withdrawn by the Air-Ministry without either the consent of the Admiralty or a decision of the Cabinet.
8th Eeeom-mendation.9th recommendation-mendatioD34. Before concluding this class of questions we must take note of a complaintmade by the Admiralty that on board the Carrier there is a good deal of duplicationof effort between the purely Naval Service and the Air Force.We think this subject should be looked into by the two Departments concerned,and we do not doubt that arrangements can be made by which all overlapping can be effectively avoided.35. We now come to the last class of questions with which we have to deal, whichare at once the most difficult and the most important. We are strongly of opinion, andwe have every hope that the two Services share our view, that, since in war theServices may have to co-operate, it is vital that in time of peace they should form an accurate estimate of each others needs and capacities.We therefore recommend :(i.) That Naval officers should be appointed to the Air Staff,(ii.) That Air Force officers should be appointed to the Naval War Staff,(jii.) That some means should be devised by which the wealth of technical-knowledge at the disposal of the Admiralty should be utilised in thetechnical departments of the Air Ministry, preferably by reinforcement ofthe staff of these departments by naval technicians.36. These recommendations refer exclusively to the headquarters of the two services ; but it is perhaps even more important that the junior ranks of the two services, who will in time occupy responsible positions, should have a considerablesprinkling of persons familiar with the needs and capacities of the other Service.10th recommendation-mendation.37. The Air Force look to a system of naval seconding for carrying out half thispolicy, and we cannot believe that the Admiralty would be averse to having membersof the Air Force on board the carriers. Unfortunately, seconding from the navy to theAir Force, as at present understood, must be deemed to have been hitherto a failure,and we. find it difficult to believe that, if the present system remains unchanged andunexplained, any great improvement is likely to occur. We cannot be surprised thata young officer who has just joined the Navy is reluctant to abandon, even tempo-temporarily, the department under which he expected to serve and to exchange it for onewhich is essentially different.   The feeling is natural, and cannot be ignored.It must, however, be pointed out that if the word &quot;seconding&quot; is thus used thisis not what any naval officer under the present scheme is expected to do. In ordinarypractice, when we say that an officer is &quot;seconded&quot; to another Service we no doubtintend to express the idea that for the duties which he had to perform and for theauthorities he had to obey in the Service which he has temporarily left, will besubstituted new duties and new authorities. But this does not really represent the facts in the case of so-called &quot; seconding&quot; from the Navy into the Air Force. The duties ofthe seconded officer, though carried out in the air, remain, nevertheless, Naval duties,and the Captain whom he has to ohey continues to be a Naval Captain.In order to make this situation perfectly clear, we recommend that no secondedNaval Officer shall be asked to perform non-naval air duties, except with the consentof the Admiralty.   We believe the Air Force are prepared to accept this principle.llth recommendation-men elation.3.8. If this recommendation be carried into effect, the most important changeinvolved in the operation of what is (somewhat inaccurately) called &quot;seconding&quot; is thechange from the Naval to a Flying uniform a change which can hardly be said totouch the essence of the situation.We suggest, however, in order to meet the sentimental, though not on that accountunimportant objection, that the uniform of a Naval flying man who, except for hisperiod of training, is to all intents and purposes still under the Admiralty, should be distinguished from the flying men under the Air Force by some differentiating badge ormark. This would be the outward and visible sign that he still remains a member ofthe Service which he originally joined. It would be a clear indication that what he proposes to do is to add accomplishments in Naval flying to the other accomplishmentswhich his brother officers are cultivating. If such a plan were found practicable, thejbjection felt by the Admiralty to the introduction of what they deem an alien elementinto the domestic life of the ship should be largely mitigated.
39. It might well be that, if this scheme succeeded, the number of officers secondedfrom the Navy to the Air Force would exceed the 30 per cent, of the total contemplated by the Air Service.We see no reason why 30 per cent, should be regarded as the maximum, and we i2fchBecom-ihould propose to leave it to the Admiralty to determine what the proportion should be, mendatlon-Bsubject to the proviso that not Jess than 30 per cent, of Air Force Officers, whether&quot;regular or short service, should serve on board the Carriers.40. There is another point of groat practical importance on which something mustbe said. It is agreed that the work of spotting for naval gunnery is one which shouldbe undertaken in all cases by Naval officers, but such investigations as we have beenable to make convince us that naval spotting and fleet reconnaissance cannot be sharplydivided, and that the officer.entrusted with the one may inevitably find himself calledupon to perform the other also. We have been unable to discover any objection to this change, which, on the face of it, seems obviously reasonable.We therefore recommend that fleet reconnaissance, as well as  naval spotting, 13tb- Kecom-ahould be entrusted to naval officers seconded or otherwise. Ucnaaion&apos;41. If anybody will take the&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;trouble to road the evidence given before us theywill, we believe, be impressed by the number of problems for which a solution has beenfound by the two Departments or suggested in this Report. We earnestly trust thatino merely technical difficulties will be allowed to stand in the way of a settlement which in the public interest is most urgently required.(Signed)      BALFOUR (Chairman),PEEL.WEIR.M.

July 1923.SECRET.IC.P.-346 (23). ymAppendix JOCABINET.SUB-COMMITTEE OF THE COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE on national AND IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Co-ordination op the Defence Forces.Memorandum by the Chairman.ALTHOUGH the Committee on National and Imperial Defence has reachedthe final stages of its enquiry, I regret that we shall not be able to present the final report to the Cabinet before the Recess, owing to the heavy demand made by otherurgent questions on the time of my colleagues and myself.2. The Cabinet have already taken decisions on Interim Reports and Resolutionssubmitted by the Committee in regard to The strength of the Royal Air Force for Home Defence,The Relations of the Army and the Air Force,and I am submitting to my colleagues, in a separate Memorandum, the Committee&apos;srecommendations on the Relations of the Navy and the Air Force in regard to fleet air work.3. There is one other question of great public interest which was included in theOommittee&apos;s Terms of Reference, and on which it is possible that my colleagues willthink that a statement should be made before Parliament rises. I refer to theCo-ordination of the Defence Departments.4. A large part of our enquiry has been devoted to this question in regard towhich we obtained Memoranda from the following authorities outside theGovernment Service :- Lord Middleton.Lord Haldane.Major-General Seely.Sir Eric Geddes.Field-Marshal Sir William Robertson.Lieutenant-General Sir Aylmer Hunter-Weston.Major-General Sir John Davidson.Major-General Sir Frederick Sykes.We also discussed the question very fully with the Chiefs of Staff of the three fighting Services., 5. The Committee&apos;s recommendations; which I submit to the Cabinet on their behalf, are as follows: (1.) It is undesirable and impracticable to supersede the Ministerial heads of thethree Fighting Services by making them subordinates of a Minister ofDefence; the alternative plan for an amalgamation of the three service departments is equally impracticable.(2.) On the other hand, the existing system of co-ordination by the Committee ofImperial Defence is not sufficient to secure full initiative and responsi-bility for defence as a whole and requires to be defined and strengthened.[10400]   [10405]   [10424]
(3.) Under the existing system the Committee of Imperial Defence, an advisor;!and consultative body, enquires into and makes recommendations iJregard to the issues of defence policy and organisation which are brought before it.   The power of initiative lies with the Government Departments!and with the Prime Minister.(4.) This system, though invaluable up to a point, does not make any authority]. except the Prime Minister, who can only devote a small part of his timeand attention to defence questions, directly responsible for the initiation of a consistent line of policy directing the common action of the three oiany two of the three Services, taking account of the reactions of the three services upon one another.(5.) While, therefore, the existing system of departmental initiative shouldcontinue, the responsibility for the wider initiative referred to above inconclusion (4) should also rest with the Chairman of the Committee ofImperial Defence acting under the general direction of the Committee oiImperial Defence and with the assistance of the three Chiefs of Staff. I(6.) In accordance with the terms of the Treasury Minute of the 4th May, 1904,1constituting the Committee of Imperial Defence in its present form, the committee I of Imperial Defence should continue to consist of the Prime 1Minister, as President, with such other members as, having regard to the Inature of the subject to be discussed, he may from time to time summoilto assist him.   In pursuance of a decision by the Prime Minister, the!Committee places on record that the following should be members: The Chairman (Deputy to the Prime Minister).The Secretary of State for War.The Secretary of State for Air.The First Lord of the Admiralty.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, or the Financial Secretary.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.The Secretary of State for the Colonies.The Secretary of State for India.The Chiefs of Staff of the three Fighting Services.The Permanent Secretary of the Treasury as head of the Civil IService.Other British or Dominion Ministers of the Crown and other officials, or Ipersons having special qualifications, will be summoned by the President Iaccording to the nature of the business.(7.) The functions of the Chairman of the Committee of Imperial Defence Ishould be :  I(i.) To preside over the Committee of Imperial Defence in the absence 1of the Prime Minister,(ii.) To report to the Prime Minister (when he himself has not presided) Iand to the Cabinet the recommendations of the Committee of imperial Defence.(iii.) In matters of detail, to interpret the decisions of the Prime minister and the Cabinet thereupon to the Departments concerned, I(iv.) Assisted by the three Chiefs of Staff, as laid down in conclusion (5) Iabove, to keep the defence situation as a whole constantly under 1revieAv so as to ensure that defence preparations and plans and Ithe expenditure thereupon, are co-ordinated and framed to meet ipolicy, that full information as to the changing naval, military 1and air situation may always be available to the Committee oi imperial Defence and that resolutions as to the requisite action Ithereupon may be submitted for its consideration.(8.) It should be laid down that, in addition to the function of the Chiefs of 1Staff as advisers on questions of sea, land or air policy respectively,!c their own Board or Council, each of the three Chiefs of Staff should nave, Ian individual and collective responsibility for advising on defence policy ras a Avhole, the three constituting, as it were, a Super-Chief of a War IStaff in Commission. In carrying out this function they should nieeJ Itogether for the discussion of questions which affect their join&apos; Kresponsibilities.
(9.) Questions relating to co-ordination of expenditure may be entertained bythe Committee of Imperial Defence when referred to it by the Cabinet.The Committee (subject to any directions by the Cabinet) should consider such questions in the light of.the general defence policy of the Govern-ment and of the strategical plans drawn up to give effect to that policyin time of war.(10.) The Secretariat of the Committee of Imperial Defence should continue toact as liaison officers between the Chairman of the Committee and theService Departments. The staff of the Committee should bo strengthened by the addition of an Assistant Secretary to be nominated by the PrimeMinister on the recommendation of the Secretary of State for Air, whosestatus will be identical with that of the three existing assistant secretaries nominated by the Prime Minister on the recommendation ofthe Secretary of State for War, the Secretary of State for India and theFirst Lord of the Admiralty.(11.) The Standing Defence Sub-Committee should be suppressed and its pastproceedings should be merged into those ,of the Committee of ImperialDefence.S.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,July 27, 1923.

Moody, Colonial Office* Added at a later date.
ft&apos;)SECRET.th( !CABINET.PALESTINE  COMMITTEE.The Future of Palestine.REPORT.THE Committee of the Cabinet, who were appointed to examine and adviseupon the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in relation to Palestine, have heldseveral sittings, and now present the following Report : We have had the advantage of hearing a full exposition of the present situationin Palestine from the High Commissioner, Sir H. Samuel, who answered all ourquestions with great readiness. We have not taken any other outside evidence,mainly from the difficulty of discriminating between the witnesses who might desireto be heard, still more because the time at our disposal before the end of the Sessionhas been short and because we felt that the most urgent need is a prompt and finaldecision by His Majesty&apos;s Government, whatever be the form that it assumes.It is not necessary to analyse here the contents of the various papers which havebeen submitted to and studied by the Committee.   Many of them raise issues uponwhich wide differences of opinion have at different times been held, but which arein a sense obsolete, because no one now seriously advocates a complete reversal ofpolicy on their account.   Of such a nature are the promises or pledges, not alwaysclear or consistent, which have been made to the Arabs and about which a wordy1 warfare can easily be waged.   This question may be said to have been finally disposedI of in the White Paper of last summer, and unless it is proposed to tear up in totoI that declaration of Government policy, it is unnecessary to revive it.    BroadlyI speaking, we can claim with justice to be innocent of any conscious breach of faithI either to the Arabs or to anyone else.Similarly, it is no longer pertinent to discuss the policy of the originalI Declaration of 1917. There are some of our number who think that that DeclarationI was both unnecessary and unwise, and who hold that our subsequent troubles have i sprung in the main from its adoption. But that was nearly six years ago. We[cannot ignore the fact that ever since it has been the accepted policy of His Majesty&apos;s1 Government, that it was also accepted, not indeed without some reluctance, by thef whole of our Allies, that it met with especial favour in America, that it was officially(endorsed at San Remo, that it figured in the original Treaty of Sevres, and that it!was textually reproduced in the Mandate for Palestine, which was officially submittedgto and approved by the Council of the League of Nations in July 1922. Further,lit has been the basis upon which Zionist co-operation in the development of PalestineIJhas been freely given and upon which very large sums of Jewish money have sincejjbeen subscribed.Whether this policy has been wise or unwise, the above considerations, whichgjcannot be disputed, possess a cumulative weight from which it is well-nigh impossibleffor any Government to extricate itself without a substantial sacrifice of consistencyland self-respect, if not of honour. Those of us who have disliked the policy are notprepared to make that sacrifice. Those of us who approved the policy throughoutfwould, of course, speak in much less equivocal terms.[10390]
Nevertheless, the alternative of a complete reversal of the policy hithertopursued is one that, whatever thejprice that might have to be paid for it, we have notdogmatically refused to consider. The reasons, apart from those which have alreadybeen indicated, which lead us to advise against such a course are these :  1. We see no way of reversing the policy without throwing up the Mandate.2. If we return the Mandate another claimant would very quickly be forth-coming.   Whether that claimant were France or Italy, the result wouldbe equally injurious to British and, as we think, to Palestinian, interests.3. If no applicant were forthcoming and the Palestinian Arabs were left towork out their own destiny, the sequel could hardly fail to be the return,at no distant period, of the Turks. This would be an even more disastrousconsequence, and would, indeed, involve the final sacrifice of all for whichwe fought and won the Eastern war.4. Although the strategical value of Palestine is rated by the Imperial GeneralStaff less highly than it had been placed by some authorities, yet none ofns can contemplate with equanimity the installation in Palestine of another Power.These considerations led us to a careful scrutiny of the position as it now stands.Great harm has, no doubt, been done by the exaggerated pretensions of the Zionistorganisations and press at air-earlier stage, and, if the Arabs have been badlyfrightened, it has been.largely in consequence of these mistaken tactics. During thepast year, however, the Zionist leaders have greatly modified both their claims andtheir language, and their acceptance of the policy laid down by the late Governmentin the White Paper of June 1922 has, we believe, been sincere and ungrudging. Onthe other hand, the continuance of the agitation here, and perhaps also the changeof Government in England, have led the Arabs to think that a complete reversal ofpolicy is still possible, and that by refusing all compromise, perhaps even byorganising some form of passive resistance, they may induce His Majesty&apos;s Govern-rnent, if not to abandon the Mandate, at least to give to Palestine a full measure ofself-government which they could utilise to obtain a complete ascendancy over thenumerically small minority of Jews. It would appear to be from this standpointthat the Arabs have boycotted the recent elections for the Legislative Council, andmay even, as some anticipate, have recourse to more extreme measures. The con-clusion that we deduce from these considerations is not that an agitation so inspiredand conducted should be yielded to, but that an early and firm decision is necessaryin order to prevent it from attaining a further and more dangerous momentum.If this object is to be secured, the decision so arrived at should aim at meetingthose of the Arab grievances or complaints in which there is substance, without, atthe same time, breaking faith with those to whom we are deeply and honourablypledged. Our search for this avenue of extrication has been materially assisted bythe complainants themselves. If we study their petitions and speeches we find that it is not so much the existence of the Mandate, or the Balfour Declaration, or the recognition of a Jewish National Home (in its later and narrower interpretation) towhich they object, as it is the preferential position which has been accorded to the zionists in the country, and the universal Arab belief that the scales are weightedagainst the Arabs in the Administration. The appointment of a Jewish HighCommissioner, however able and impartial (and Sir H. Samuel has heen both in noordinary degree); the existence of a Jewish Agency in Palestine with special access to the High Commissioner; the not inconsiderable (although restricted) immigrationof many thousands of Jews since the war; the encouragement, however expedientand cautious, of Jewish enterprise, e.g-., the Rutenberg Concession, have all fosteredthis belief that the Jews are being unduly favoured and that the Arabs are beingpushed into a background where the spoils of Palestine will be for others, and neverfor them.The question to be answered then is this: Is there any real ground for thissuspicion, and, if so, can it be relieved?At this stage our attention was turned to the exact words of the Mandate,Article 4 of which runs as follows: &quot; An appropriate Jewish agency shall be recognised as a public body for&quot; the, purpose of advising and co-operating with the Administration of&quot; Palestine in such economic, social and other matters as may affect the establish-&quot; ment of the Jewish National Home and the interests of the Jewish population&quot; in Palestine, and, subject always to the control of the Administration, to&quot; assist and take part in the development of the country.       .   .
9 n 9U d&quot; The Zionist organisation, so long as its organisation and constitution&quot; are, in the opinion of the Mandatory, appropriate, shall be recognised as such&quot; agency. It shall take steps, in consultation with His Britannic Majesty&apos;s&quot; Government, to secure the co-operation of all Jews who are willing to assist&quot; in the establishment of the Jewish National Home.&quot;A little later comes Article 6, which runs thus : &quot;The Administration of Palestine, while ensuring that the rights and&quot; position of other sections of the population are not prejudiced, shall facilitate&quot;Jewish immigration under suitable conditions and shall encourage, in&quot;co-operation with the Jewish agency referred to in Article 4, close settlement&quot; by Jews on the land, including State lands and waste lands not required for&quot;public purposes.&quot;Now it is true that Article 6 lays down that &apos;&apos; the rights and position of other&quot;sections of the population shall not be prejudiced&quot; (in respect of immigration).But this gives no consolation to those who believe that an extended Zionist influxcannot fail to cause such prejudice. Nor is the impression produced by Article 4diminished; it is, on the contrary, aggravated by the terms of Article 2, which runsas follows : 1&quot;The Mandatory shall be responsible for placing the country under such&quot;political, administrative and economic conditions as will secure the establish-&quot;ment of the Jewish National Home as laid down in the preamble, and the&quot;development of self-governing institutions, and also for safeguarding the civil. &quot;and religious rights of all the inhabitants of Palestine, irrespective of race&quot;and religion.&quot;It is difficult to blame those who argue that the two parts of this Article are inconsistent with each other, and, indeed, that the entire Mandate is built on thefallacy of attempting to reconcile the irreconcilable, and to combine in the sameframework the creation of Jewish privileges with the maintenance of Arab rights.It would appear then that it is to the terms of the Mandate that we should look for a solution of the difficulty, and that if we can redress the alleged preference tothe Jews, by offering similar or analogous advantages to the Arabs, we may succeed in removing the sting. We accordingly proceeded to consider whether, and, if so^how, this could be done.It may be urged, with justice, that the Mandatory Power had its own plan fordealing with the grievance said to have been thus created, viz., by means of theLegislative Council upon which elected representatives of the Arabs were to sit.That is quite true. But the Legislative Council has broken down for the time being,through the refusal of the Arabs to take part in the elections; and although Sir H.Samuel hopes to be able to induce some representative Arabs to serve on the AdvisoryCouncil which he is reconstituting as an interim measure, the fact remains that theBritish policy has for the time being failed and that some other remedy must besought.We accordingly advise that as regards the Administration, an Arab Agencyshall be set up which will occupy a position exactly analogous to that accorded to theJewish Agency under the terms of the Mandate, i.e., it will be recognised as a publicbody for the purpose of advising and co-operating with the Administration in sucheconomic, social and other matters as may affect the interests of the non-Jewishpopulation, and, subject to the control of the Administration, may assist and take part in the development of the country.Secondly as regards immigration (Article 6) it will have the right to be consulted as to the means of &quot;ensuring that the rights and position of other (i.e., non-Jewish)&quot;sections of the population are not prejudiced.&quot;With regard to public works it will be entitled to be consulted by the Administra-tion in the same way as the Jewish Agency is to be consulted under the terms ofArticle 11.    ,Further, Article 84 of the Palestine Order in Council of 1922 provides that &quot; (i.) The High Commissioner shall confer upon all matters relating to the&apos;&apos; regulation of immigration with a Committee consisting of not less than one-half&apos;* of the unofficial members of the Legislative Council, and provision shall be mader&apos;by Order in Council for investing the said Committee witli all such powers[10390] c
&quot;and authorities and otherwise for the constitution and conduct of the business&quot; of the said Committee, as may be necessary to carry this Article into effect.&quot; (ii.) In the event of any difference of opinion between the High Commis-&quot;sioner and the said Committee upon any such matter as aforesaid, the High&quot; Commissioner shall make a full report on the subject to the Secretary of State,&quot; whose decision thereon shall be final.&quot;&quot;With the breakdown of the Legislative Council, the proposed Committee has never come into existence, it is proposed that the Arab Agency now in contemplationshould take its place for the purposes of the functions indicated m Article 8*.As regards the composition of the Arab Agency, it is proposed that it should baleft to the High Commissioner to nominate suitable persons, it being of course under---tood that representatives of all sections of the Arab community will be included.Sir Herbert Samuel is of opinion that this proposal may be accepted, not indeedoy the Arab extremists, who want representative Government and Arab ascendancyHt a bound, but by an appreciable section of Arab opinion, to whom indeed it wouldnot only be a great concession, but would mean the removal of one of the grievance?m which they have laid most emphasis.It goes without saying that the consent of the Zionists would also have to beprocured. We must do nothing that could be interpreted by them as a breach of faithind we do not want to staunch the flow of the subscriptions from the Jewish world,-which are still essential for the material prosperity, perhaps even for the continued existence, of their colonies in Palestine, and secondarily for the future developmentof Palestine as a whole. When, however, we recall the terms of their pledge as recorded in the White Paper in the concluding paragraph of Dr. Weizmann&apos;s letterof the 18th June, 1922, and when they realise that the alternative may be the jeopardy,if not the loss, of the National Home itself, it cannot, I think, be doubted that counselsof wisdom will prevail.We feel, however, very strongly that if this great concession to Arab sentimentbe made, it should only be made as part of an agreed settlement with them, that itmust be accepted by their representative organisations and by their leaders as afinal settlement, and that an end must be placed to the agitation, whether inPalestine or outside, which has been the fruitful source of so much trouble, expense,and even bloodshed. The arrangement is one that must be loyally implemented byall parties otherwise we shall have conceded much for no adequate return.We further discussed the question whether it would be desirable to invest this settlement, supposing it to be made, with the sanction of a wider authority than our own, and to endeavour to secure for it the approval of the League of Nations.We think that there is a great deal to be said for this course, and that, whetherthrough the medium of a Report to the Council of the League in response to the questionnaire which has already under the existing Regulations been addressed bythe League to the Mandatory Power or by more direct action, the sanction of theLeague should be procured. It might even be desirable to apply formally for the incorporation of the new Articles in the body of the Mandate itself. This, of course,could only be done with the consent of all the Powers represented on the Council,which it would be a little invidious for them to refuse. But such a. plan must alsobe conditional upon the absolute and unequivocal acceptance of the compromise bythe parties principally concerned, i.e., the Palestinian Jews and the Arabs themselves.While this is the concrete suggestion that we submit to the Cabinet, we shouldnot like the latter to think that we have not considered whether it would be possible,as in the case of Iraq, to place a limit of time to our commitments and our expendi-ture in Palestine. The circumstances, however, differ in toto. In Iraq we are dealingwith an Arab State and an Arab Government, which has already an organisedexistence, and the entry of which into the League of Nations we contemplate in afew years&apos; time. There is no parallel to this in Palestine, where the Arabs in presentcircumstances can scarcely be regarded as capable either of forming a Government orconstituting a State. In Iraq we are under no commitments to a particular class ofthe population as we are to the Zionists in Palestine. In Iraq we are not present,as we are in the Holy Land, as the trustees, so to speak, of civilisation, into whosehands has been committed by the world a sacred, trust that it would be almost ,shameful to abandon.   There is, indeed, no analogy between the two situations.Sir H. Samuel, in his recorded evidence, placed before us his estimate of thefuture of Palestine, both as regards the military responsibilities and the financial obligations which it will entail, and also as regards the economic development of thecountry.   These estimates may turn out to be unduly sanguine; already they have to
jome extent been checked by the less rosy forecast of Sir G. Clayton. We feel thatIhe only way in which these doubts can be resolved is by securing stability andcreating confidence, and that the best hope for the relief of the British taxpayer lies in improving the economic conditions of the country. Sir G. Clayton himselfConcludes by saying that &apos;&apos; there is no ground whatever -for advocating the abandon-f&apos;ment of the Zionist policy or relinquishing the Mandate&quot;; and by asking whether&quot;&quot;a way cannot be found, by modifying objectionable Articles in the Mandate, or atI&quot; least by removing all possible grounds for any charges of partiality or bad faith;&quot; to dissipate the present fear and distrust of the Arabs.&quot;That&quot; is the precise object with which we have put forward the proposalslontained in this Report.Signed on behalf of the Committee,DEVONSHIRE.July 27, 1923.
