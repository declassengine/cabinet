Subsequently the two listshad been amalgamated and the names had been placed inalphabetical order, with the result that the names In theoriginal list of Honours conferred for political and public services had appeared without any explanatory statement..,.It was pointed out, however? that the Royal Commission onHonours had considered that some details should be givenin every case, and that inclusion in a general list ofHonours for political and public services was insufficientexplanation..
