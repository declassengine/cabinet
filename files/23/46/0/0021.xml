Sines their last Report to the Cabinet (C.P.356 (23)the Committee on unemployment have held three furthermeetings and the question of providing further-means ofemployment has received the constant consideration of theDepartments -concerned.   Tho committee are glad to report -that the War Office, after4 a consideration of the whole position., have found it possible to accelerate works tc thovalue of  450*000 and that the Admiralty have been able toincrease the acceleration undertaken by them to an amount of;P:j( 36 jOGOo    It is however regretted that only part of theAdmiralty work can be placed in Barrow-in-Furnessj where, as has previously been reported, unemployment stands at a very high figure and the prospects of a real recovery are remote.2. Considerable progress lias been made In dealingwith applications for assistance made by local authorities totho Unemployment Grants committee.   Applications for grants in respect of works amounting to a total value of  84,000,000have been received and ---the - committee ^recoiiEmend that theUnemployment Grants committee should be authorised to assistschemes up to a total value of  20*000,000 in lieu of the   - 10*000.000 already approved.A press notice of the conditions upon which grantskay be made to public utility companies has been issued. Atpresent the Committee do not recommend the fixing of a limitup to which schemes of this kind will be assisted.3. The Committee have received from the Ministry ofTransport an extensive programme for road and bridge work(including the construction of the Edinburgh-Glasgow road).The committee have given careful consideration to the terms 03
which assistance from the Road Fund should be given to these works and the extent to which the charses should be borne bythe local authorities concerneda4.        They recornmend that road works amounting to 3,000,000 in counties adjoining London be carried out bythe London county Council with a contribution of 75$ of thetotal cost from the Road Fund;    that the contribution of theRoad Fund to the Glasgow-Edinburgh road scheme, (total cost 2,000,000) which lies almost entirely outside the boundaries of the two cities, should al30 be 75;2;   and that thecontributions from the Road Fund to other road schemes shouldnot, without Treasury sanction, exceed 50%t or 50$, according as the road is without? or within, the boundaries of theauthority constructing it.   Excluding the two schemes abovespecified road works costing a total sum of  4,000,000 are contemplated.5.        As regards bridges, the_Comm.it tee re commend that a contribution from the Road Fund not exceeding 75% be made inrespect of the Queensferry Bridge, Flintshire, (roughlyestimated to cost  150,000) and a Berwick Bridge across theTweed (roughly estimated to cost  200,000) and that thecontributions towards the re-cons truetion of other bridgeswhether of iron or steel or of ferro-eencrete, be a sum notexceeding 65% of the cost unless special sanction is obtained ,from the Treasury.    Bridge works costing a total sum of 2,500,000 are contemplated.6.        The Commj.ttee recor-mend that the Road Fund beauthorised to expend a total sum of  8,000,000 in respect ofthe works described in paragraph (4) and (5) above.   Thequestion whether a further recommendation should be submitted in regard to the construction of the Liverpool-Manchester Roadhas been deferred pending a settlement of questions arising asto the northern and western Motorway.-2-
7. The Committee have further had under consideration proposals for the reconstruction of the Menai Suspension Bridge. This Bridge was built at the National cost and its maintenance has been a National liability though the tolls upon the Bridge have ordinarily produced an income in excess of the expenditure required. An entire reconstruction of this Bridge will be necessary in six or seven years and the Committee recommend that the reconstruction of the Bridge should now be undertaken by the Ministry of Transport at the cost of the Road Fund, with a contribution of £50,000 from the Exchequer, the balance of the cost except in so far as it may be met by contributions from local authorities to met from the Road Fund. The cost of reconstruction is estimated at £250,000. It should, however, be a condition of the reconstruction of the Bridge that the new Bridge should be freed from tolls and be maintained by the County Councils of Anglesey and Carnarvon.

8. The Committee hope to present at an early date a further report dealing with inter alia the possibilities of increasing employment by the anticipation of programmes of Colonial Development.
