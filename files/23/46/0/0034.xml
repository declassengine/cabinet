Tangier zone of Morocco.     An Agreement has just been reached between the delegates of theseBowers, which provides for the creation of anInternational re^gime at Tangier and for the promotion of communications and trade.      It ia hopedthat a longstanding source of trouble will thus be removed.A Bill will be introduced into Parliamentforthwith to give effeot to the Lausanne treaty with Turkey Of July last.     As soon as this bill has been passed, the Treaty will be ratified, anda new era of peaceful relations with Turkeywill open,     Negotiations for the settlementof the one outstanding question with the TurkishGovernment, namely that of Mosul, are about to begin.My Ministers, in common with the dominion representatives, have been anxious to settle in a spirit of conciliation the difficulty frithregard to the illicit importation of liquor intothe United States, and have, with this object,made proposals for an agreement which is on the eve v*f conclusion, and which should stillfurther strengthen the happy relations prevailingbetween tho two countries and peoples.My Government have oucoessfully negotiatedtreaties of commerce with Poland, Czecho--SlovakiaFinland and Latvia.
The reoent series cf murders on the NorthWest Frontier of India by criminals who have sought refuge in Afghan territory or&apos; are Afghansubjects, has caused Me much concern.    my government have made vigorous representations to the Government of H.M* The Amir, and I earnestly trust that these persons will be punished, and more satisfactory relations onthe frontier be established, at a very early

MY LORDS AMD MEMBERS OP THE HOUSE OP COMMONS,While I am glad, to note that the schemes for providing employment now in operation have had an appreciable effect during the last year in reducing thenumbers of those actually unemployed, the number stillunable to find work causes Me the gravest concern.My Ministers recently laid before the country proposalswhich, in their judgment, would have contributedmaterially to a solution of this problem by affordingto Industry a greater measure of security in the home market and an Improved outlet for its products InMy Dominions overseas and In foreign countries; but these proposals ?,rere not accepted by the country,In these circumstances your assent will be invitedto an extension and amendment of the Trade Facilities and export Credit Schemes, to the proposal of the ImperialEconomic Conference for expediting and assisting the execution of certain public enterprisesthroughout the Empire by the grant of financial aid from public funds, and to an extension of the contributions towards the cost of Public Utility Works, whether under-taken by local authorities        or promoted by statutoryand private corporations.
You will also be asked to assist in providingwork in the shipbuilding industry by the immediateconstruction of orulsers and auxiliary craftin anticipation of the Naval Programme.A serious consequence of the prevalence of unemploy-ment is the deterioration, in character and oapacityfor skilled work, of.young persons who have left or arenow leaving school.     To mitigate this evil     stepswill be taken to develop the existing system of juvenile unemployment Centres and to provide increased facilitiesfor general and technical education.
7.     The condition of agriculture remains a source of serious anxiety.     In the absence of authorityfor the policy whioh My Ministers placed beforethe country at the recent election, they propose to summon a conference representative of all those interested in agriculture, and of the variouspolitical parties, with the object of arriving at an agreed policy, by which the acreage efarable land may be maintained, and regular employ-ment at an adequate wage secured for the agriculturalworker.A series of outbreaks of foot-and-mouth diseaseof unusual severity has occurred.    Great difficulty has been found in dealing with this destructiveepidemic, but I hope that the measures now beingtaken will effecttially stamp it out.
8.     My Ministers are impressed with the neoessityfor dealing comprehensively with the various Insurancsystems, namely, Unemployment Insurance, HealthInsurance and Old Age Pensions.     Pending theoompletion of their investigations on these subjects they prop3se to introduce a measureproviding that in the calculation of means account shall not be taken of Friendly Societies or TradesUnion benefits, allowances from superannuation funds,or inoome of a corresponding amount derived from private savings.A Bill will also be at once introduced to-increase the pensions of Pre-War Pensioners andto remove certain disabilities under which theynew suffer.You will be asked to develop the Probationarysystem of dealing with offenders.    Bills will beintroduced to amend and consolidate the factory and Workshops Acts, to legltt&amp;mize children bornout tf wedlock whose parents have subsequentlymarried and to amend the law relating to separationand maintenance orders, ts give effect to certainInternational Conventions for the benefit of merchant seamen, and to improve the treatment of mentaldisorder.
9.       I am glad to think that the Houeing Act oflast session has proved most successful in dealingwith the grave shortage of houses.     My ministers have since approved the erection af largenumbers of houses, both by Looal Authorities andby private enterprise, and the pursuance of thispolles; will involve a still larger demand for skilled labour in the building trade.     Furtherth^I.ooal Authorities; have been approached witha view to increased, activity under those sectionsof the Act whioh enable thk working population tobecome the owners of their own   homes,
10.    In fulfilment of pledges already givenmeasures will be laid before you for completingland Purchase in Northern Ireland; and also for authorising the Exchequer to guarantee theprincipal and interest of bonds issued by theGovernment of the Irish Free State under theLand Act recently passed in that Dominion.The obligation to alleviate hardshipcaused by the former disturbances in ireland is one which is recognised by My Governmentand will continue to engage their activeattention.
