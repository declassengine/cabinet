(This Document is the^roperty^ of His Britannic&apos;MaJes^y&apos; )L S E ORE T -CABINET 51 (23)CONCLUSIONS of a Meeting of the Cabinet,held at 10, Downing Street, S.W. 1, onMONDAY, OCTOBER 29,&quot; 1923, at 5 p.m.[FOREIGN[POLICY.Reparation.previous inference:cabinet 50(23), Oon-conclusion  3.)The Cabinet had before them;-(i) The reply of the French Government to theproposals contained in the telegram sent by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs on October 19th. for a Conferencealternatively of representatives of Gov-ernments or of experts to be appointed bythe Reparation Commission, to considerthe question of reparations by Germany.In this reply the French Governmentexpressed its assent to the second alter-native&apos;, and its readiness &quot;to request theco-operation of the American Governmentin the examination of the reparation problem and to agree that a joint representation tothat effect be made at V/aebington&quot; on condi-tion that no abandonment of&apos; the powers ofthe Reparation Commission was involved (paper cp.-432 (23)).(ii) The replies of the Belgian and italian governments, also assenting to the second alternative proposal (Brussels telegramNo.229, and Rome telegram No.266.)(iii) A summary of a speech delivered by M.Polncareat Sampigny^ on the previous day (Paris tele-gram No.958), which was amplified in Presstelegrams in such manner as to make cleaS?that M. Poincare- would not consent to any discussion by the nroposed expert Committeeof the amount ( 6,600^000:000) fixed by the&apos;   Reparation Commissi on under the provisionsof the Treaty of Versailles as the sum totalof Germany1s payments.
The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave theCabinet full particulars of the present position, and road a draft telegram? the terms of which had been accepted, at ameeting of the Imperial Conference the same-morning (E&quot; - 13thMinutes).    In this draft., telegram it was proposed to invitethe French, Belgian and Italian Governments to instruct their respective Ambassadors at Washington to concert withtheir Allied -oolleaguos in welcoming the.prospect of Americanparticipation in the proposed Committee to consider the capacity of Germany to pay, and to express the hope that theGovernment of the United States would allow their representa-tive on the Reparation Commission to nominate an Americanexpert as a member of the proposed Committee which the AlliedGovernments now proposed to invite the Reparation Commissionto set up.Discussion took place as to whether, in the draft telegram, it would be advisable to ask our Allies to notifyto the American Government that the Committee was to beappointed(as stated in the Aide-Momoire of acceptance by theUnited States Government) &quot;for the purpose of consideringquestions of the capacity of Germany to make reparations&quot;,thus removing all ambiguity from the outset;    or whether, inview of Mo Poincare&apos;s publicly-announced- objections to this,it&apos;might not be wiser to adopt some less challenging formula to define the Committee&apos;s task, such as that contained&apos;inthe French Government1s note, viz., &quot;the examination of thereparation problem&quot;.During the discussion a message was received from theTreasury to the effect that a very important message was onits way from Sir John Bradbury, the British representative  .  .on the Reparation Commission, who hoped that a decision wouldbe postponed until it had been considered by the Cabinet.
in these circumstances the cabinet.net agreed  To postpone their decision until thefollowing day? when a special meeting would be &quot;held, at 12 Noon.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs proposedthat, before the Reparation Commission proceeded to discussthe composition and terms of reference to the Committee,Sir John Bradbury should be invited to London to discussthe matter, including the question of whether or not itwould be advisable for him to propose the Inclusion ofGerman and neutral representatives on the expert Committee.

TheCabins tagreed -(a) That, in view of the strong appeal made      bythe representatives of Canada and New Zealandat the. Imperial Economic Conference, thePresident of the. Board of Trade should beauthorised to apply to apples the same principle as had already been agreed toin the ease of certain dried fruits, andto announce that a duty of 5^- a cwt.shouldbe imposed on their importation from abroad,with a total remission of the duty in thecase of the Dominions and Colonies.     Thisdecision was taken on the understanding thatthe Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries wasin agreement with&quot;the policy..       The Presidentof the Board of Trade&apos;was invited to insist ongreater care being exercised in the future inthe packing of apples imported from theDominions.(b) That the President of the Board of Trade shouldbe authorised not to accede to the request ofthe Australian and New Zealand Governmentsat the Imperial Economic Conference that tinnedbeef and beef products should be subjected to a duty of 5/- a cwt. with a remission of duty to the Dominions and Colonies.   Havingregard to the relatively small scale of thetrade involved, it was felt that this measuremight arouse opposition out of proportion toany advantage which might result to the Empire -as a whole. &quot;(c) To take note that a duty on vegetables, oombinedwith a remission to the Dominions and Colonies,was dobev-rred by existing Treaties with foreign states.

In vie?/ of the fact that the Prime Minister, theLord President of the Council and the Postmaster-general had engagements to deliver political speeches on thefollowing day, a short discussion took place in regard to continue Policy and connected questions, including the approximate date when it would be necessary to ask thecountry to release the Government from Mr Bonar Law&apos;spledge.In the course of the discussion the Cabinet took note j-(a) That the Prime Minister and his colleagues would announce that the Government did not contemplate any tax on Tam&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;am or meat.(b) That speakers would be justified, if they so desired, in laying stress on the immedi-ate necessity of relieving unemploymentrather than on the further developments in the Government1s economic policy, sincethe larger&quot; policy could not be put inoperation until the Government was relieved of Mr Bonar law&apos;s pledge as the result ofan appeal to the country.(c) That the Prime Minister intended to makedear that he had no desire to rush thecountry into an Election, but wished togive the electorate time to examine the government&apos;s economic policy carefully before they were called on to vote on it, and thatthe Lord President of the Council also proposed to develop the case against anearly Election.(d) That the Prime Minister and those of hiscolleagues who had received the Bepresenta-tives of the Farmers1 Union had invited themto formulate detailed proposals for assistingagriculture , and thattheir proposals, when received, would belaid before the Cabinet.(e) That the President of the Board of trade had initiated enquiries in his department as to the manufactures in need of protection and the nature of-the ultimate tariffj whichmight form the material for decisions orenquiries by the Cabinet as well as for the compilation of information for speakers andfor the general public1 pI d* Whitehall Gardens, . .w*l,-October 30, 1923.
