a r*y y ljM 3&apos;. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave therCabinet a full report as to the latest developments in theition.region of Foreign Policy? and more particularly in regardto the situation arising out of the occupation of the Ruhr;eusInoe:     the abandonment of passive resistance by Germany;   theIt 48loon-     Separatist movements in Bavaria, Saxony and the Rhineland;In 5, ) &apos;the possible effect of these movements (if successful; onthe Treaty of Versailles;    the telegrams exchanged with america and subsequently with the Allies in consequence of president Coolidge!s reaf fir-mat ion of the statement by Mr.Hughes in the previous December during tho Presidency of Mr.Harding;    and the reported concentration of troops by Russiaon the borders of the Baltic States.In the course of this statement the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs read a telegram just received fromMr Ryan (Coblenz)  (Nos 413 ) statinr: the views of the French&amp; 414High Commissioner in the Rhineland, who was not sanguine inregard to Reparations prospects;    as well as extracts fromthe report of a Conference between the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, representatives ofthe Treasury, Sir John Bradbury and Lord Hilmarnock, theBritish representative on the Rhineland Commission.The Secretary of State for War read a telegram, fromthe General Officer Commanding-in-Chief in the Rhineland statingthat for the moment he did not consider there was any cause for anxiety, in the situation as regards Cologne, nor did heat presentisee any reason why a clash should occur betweenthe civil population and the troops.      There was no reason why ;the troops should become engaged provided it was decidedto let the rival factions fight it out while the british army remained neutral^,   izff, which was by no means certain, anattempt by force were made to proclaim the Republic in Cologne.(50004 Cypher of 23rd. October).
Strong representations were made that in no olrcum-stances should British troops in the Rhineland he utilisedto suppress any movement of a Separatist tendency withinthe British zone, and that the attitude of our forces towardsany such movement should he one of strict neutrality andimpartiality.Various suggestions were made as to the line.to be taken  &quot;by the Prime Minister in regard to Foreign Policy inhis forthcoming speech to the Unionist Associations at plymouth.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That? subject to a favourable reply being received from Washington to an enquiry madeby the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,the Prime Minister should be authorised to mention the communications with the UnitedStates of America and with our Allies inregard to a possible Conference, whether ofrepresentatives of Governments or of Expertsappointed by the Reparation.

W if:C0NOMIOi)lioy OPEje govern-Unemploymentkeviousferenoe:cabinet 49Is), Oon-bsion 4.)4. In view of. his forthcoming speech to the UnionistAssociations at Plymouth, the Prime Minister gave hiscolleagues an outline of what he thought should he thepolio;/ of the Government towards the problem of Unemplo7/ment ,junder the followincr heads:-Unemployment Is the outstanding problem in the political life of the country.    failure to deal with it might wreck the Government.The root problems in unemployment are asfollows:-Population has increased and the pool of unemployed, which has always existed,is&apos; therefore larger.    Since the War the environment in which industry is carriedon has changed.    The whole economic system03o Europe, including exchange and currency,has broken down.    The economic recovery of Germany is inevitably delayed, involvingindefinite delay in the stabilisation of currency and exchange in Central Europe.Consequently new factors have enteredinto the problem of industry, includingcurrency bounties and low wages abroad.This has already been experienced inregard to Germany, and the fall of the franc in the next few months, whichjudgesanticipate, may givecompetentrise to a similar phenomenon in France,where we are already experiencing a newcompetition in such manufactured &quot;articlesas woollen goods and rubber tyres.    under-tainty as to the direction and extent of competition paralyses industry.    Anotherdanger is the possible exploitation ofGermany by cosmopolitan financiers bringingcompetition to this country, which usuallyhas to play the role of &quot;shock-absorber&quot;.To these difficulties and handicaps totrade must be added those of reparations,which may arise sooner or later.    In orderto pay for the increased imports which she requires owing to depletion of stocks and reduction in her own production,Germany must export more.    Similarly,Reparations can only be paid by increased exports.    Except in the event of a boom,comparable to the discovery of gold inCalifornia -- and no such boom is in sight -the world can only absorb such exports bya great dislocation of trade, which mustbe disastrous to this country.
All that the Government has dope forunemployment will be deemed insufficient.protective There is only one way, not to cure, butriff. to fight unemployment, and that is to.protect the home market against foreignmanufactures *&apos; Without machinery for this, we areimpotent to meet any of the dangersdescribed.Agriculture.The alternatives, viz., to do nothing orto temporise by putting on the McKenha duties on a few more articles, are of no value.It was not practicable to give protection to corn in the feasibility of form of a tariff, and thedoing; thisbounty shouldCommittee.be examined by means of  by a CabinetevelopmentEmpire...leap Rawterials.posedera!ction.After some remarks as to the political advantages of the oourse proposed, the PrimeMinister added that he would like to combinewith a protective policy the following:-Development of Empire and measures toobtain cheap raw materials within theEmpire by stimulating the productionof cotton, tobacco and sugar, a policywhich, in conjunction with protective duties,; would, tend to bring the dollarand pound to parity in New York.The Prime Minister proposed, in ordetvyto avoid any brea^ of Mr.- Bonar law s pledge,to confine action, during the Autumn session to an extension of the McKenna duties on articles in regard to which the Board of trade had received reports, but to-take the verdictof the country within six months.After some discussion, the Cabinet agreed -Aa)That in announcing this policy the PrimeMinister should endeavour to avoid- commit-ting the Cabinet as a whole or embarrassingthose of his colleagues who, owing to elect-tion pledges or other reasons, required timeto oonside&quot;r their attitude:-\That this might be effected by the PrimeMinister announcing at Plymouth- that theGovernment realised that the steps already decided on in relief of unemployment were only palliatives;   that, owing to Mr. bonar law&apos;s pledge,- they were prevented from goingfurther in&quot;Vne present Parliament;   but that,speaking for himself, he thought they mighthave to go further and apply a tariff..    &quot;TheGovernment would watch the situation, carefully,-
and, if there was no improvement j thePrime Minister would, hold himself free to propose further steps, of courseconsulting the country.    With some suchintroduction the Prime Minister, could then develop his proposals in fullsCo) That the Prime Minister should conferfurther with his colleagues in the Houseof Commons in regard to the form in whichhis policy should be presented.5 Whitehall Gardens, S.Wol,October 25, 1923.V v
