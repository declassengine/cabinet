C.P. 17 (24)



APPENDIX.



DRAFT OF THE KING&apos;S SPEECH.



MY LORDS AND MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.



1. In the domain of Foreign Affairs My Government can point to definite progress made in the solution of questions which have hitherto blocked the pathway of mutual understanding and have retarded the recovery of the world.



NOTE.



The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggests "in examining the very serious financial questions involved in the position of Germany."



The Reparation Commission has set up two Expert Committees, on which it is a satisfaction to know that America will co-operate with Great Britain, France, Italy and Belgium to examine the German Reparation problem in its broadest aspect, thereby reviving a proposal which was made by My Government in July last.

The advice of such Committees should be of the greatest value in facilitating the solution of a problem that has been a source of much anxiety. Until the Continental outlook has been cleared the economic recovery of this, as well as of other countries, is retarded. My Government will continue to lend their best efforts to bring about such a settlement.

For fully four years my Government have sought an opportunity of settling by friendly negotiations between the great Powers who are principally concerned, the future status of the 
Tangier zone mi Moroooot     An Agreement has just been roaohea between the delegates of these powers, which provides fcr the creation of anInternational regime at Tangier and for the promoting-tion of. communications and trade.    It is hfpedthat a longstanding source of trouble will thus be removed.A Bill will be introduced into Parliamentforthwith to give effect to the Lausanne treaty with Turkey of July last.   As soon as this bill has been passed, the Treaty will be ratified, anda new era will open.   Negotiations for thesettlement of the one outstanding question withthe Turkish Government, namely that sf Mosul,are about to begin.My Government, in common with the Bominio]?.Ministers at the recent  Inpsrial Conference, havebeen exceedingly anxious to settle in a spirit of conciliation the difficulty that has arisen withregard to tho illicit importation of liquor intothe United States, and have, with this object,made proposals for an agreement which is on the eve of conclusion, and which should stillfurther strengthen the happy relations prevailingbetween the two countries and peoples.My Government have successfully negotiatedtreaties qf commerce with Poland, Finland andLatvia, which should greatly faoilitate trade    1with those countries.
2, It will be one of the chief objects ofMy Government to maintain and increase by every means in their power the steady growth of theLeague of nations in efficiency and authority.A series of important international conventions have recently been concluded underthe auspices of the.League of Nations to givepractical effect to the provisions of theCovenant relating to the equitable treatmentof Commerce and the Freedom of Transit and communications.    These Conventions, which dealwith Commercial Arbitration, Customs Formalities.Maritime-ports. and international Railway Trafflohave all been signed on behalf of My Government,and they will, I trusty prove of great benefitto the interests of commerce and shipping.The League scheme for the reconstruction of Austria continues to give strikingly successful results, and it is- very greatly to be hoped thatthe similar&apos;., scheme for Hungary which&apos; Is In theprocess of negotiation will be equally successful.
3. The Imperial Conference and ImperialEconomic Conferences which were held in the autumn of last year covered the whole field of imperial interests and were marked by definite progressin Imperial co-operation in many directions aswell as by unanimity in their conclusions..More particularly was it found possible at theImperial Economic Conference, without departure from the existing fiscal system in this country,to meet the wishes of the Dominions by a substantialextension of the principle of Imperial preferenceestablished by the Imperial War Conference of 1917and in force since 1919.    proposals to give effectto the conclusions of both Conferences&apos;,  In sefar as legislation may be necessary-, will besubmitted to you in due course,4-.        My Government look forward to theopportunity which will be afforded by theBritish Empiro Exhibition to be held thisyear of increasing the knowledge of the variedresources of all parts of My Empire and ofs timula ting Intor- Impe rial trade.5-.      MEMBERS OF THE. HOUSE OF COMMONS.The&apos;Estimates for the public services in thecoming year will be submitted to. you In due course.
MY LORDS AND MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE Off COMMONS.Notwithstanding some improvement during the last few weeks the amount of unemployment continues to causeMe grave concern.     My Ministers recently laid beforethe country proposals which, in their judgment, would,have contributed materially to a solution of this problem by affording to industry a greater measureof security in the home marxet and an improved outletfoar its products in My Dominions overseas and inforeign countries; but their proposals were not accepted by the country.      In these circumstances.My Ministers are proceeding with such action as it ispossible to take for the increase of employment.You will be asked to assist in providing work in the shipbuilding industry by the construction of someCruisers and auxiliary craft to be taken in hand, withoutdelay.Your assent will also be invited to an extensionand amendment of the Export Credits and Trade Facilitiesschemes and to a proposal approved by the ImperialEconomic Conference for expediting and assisting theexecution of certain public enterprises in theDominions and India and in the Crown Colonies and protectorates by, the grant of financial aid from public funds.
One of the worst results of the difficultiesof obtaining employment is the loss of training in,the skilled trades by young persons who hare leftschool within the last few years, and by those whoars new leaving school;    In order to minimise thoeffects upon the young people and to reduce thecompetition for employment, measures will be proposedto enable mere of those why cannot find employment&quot;rand whs are likely to be ablo to benefit, to obtainpractical instruction or Industrial Training,    andalso to extend the provision made for juvenile unemployment oentres.
7.      Ihe condition of Agriculture continuesto Toe a source of grave anxiety.    The resultof the election having been adverse to theproposals of My Ministers for dealing withthe situation, alternative means for preventing a further reduction in the areaof arable land, and for ensuring a livingwage to agricultural workers will be thesubject of most careful enquiry.X series of outbreaks of Foot and Mouth,disease of unusual severity having occurred,My Ministers are making every possible effort to free the country from this disastrous complaint.
8.       The whole Question of the position of Pre-war pensioners and Old Age Pensioners and of the various forms of National Insurance is now under examinationwith a view to seeing in what way the present systemmay be improved.Among the measures which vill be presented for consideration will be Mils dealing with theguardianship of children and the legitimation ofchildren born out of wedlock whose parents.havesubsequently married.    You will also be askedto further the development of a system of dealingwith offenders by means of probation Officers.
9.     During the past year considerable progress has teen made with the provision of houses.Since the passing of the Housing Act, 1923,the Minister of Health has approved the erection of many thousands cf houses with financialassistance under the Act, and there is evidencethat a marked revival of building by privateenterprise is in progress^My Ministers anticipate that the housingshortage will be considerably relieved in thecoming building season and will take^steps toencourage such a development in the capacity ofthe building industry, especially in thedirection of an increased supply of skilledlaboxir, as will ensure more rapid progresswithout a rise in cost cf construction.You will be invited to fix the remuneration of practitioners under the National HealthInsurance Acts, and to make provision for improved treatment of mental disorder.
10.     til general fulfilment of pledges givefl atthe time of the Treaty between Great Britain landIreland measures will be pui before you forcompleting Lurid Purchase in northern Ireland! andalso for authorising the Exchequer to guarantee the principal and interest of bonds issued by theGovernment of the Irish Free State under the LandAct recently passed in that Dominion.The obligation laid upon My Ministers to alleviate hardship caused by the former disturbances in Ireland continues to engage their active attention
11;     Proposals will &quot;be laid before you, inconnection with the expansion of the RoyalAir Force for Hone Defence, for making further provision as to the organisation and cond.it ionsof service of the Auxiliary Air Force and. AirForce Reserve with a view to the formation of auxillary and Special Reserve&apos;Squadrons.
12.     Proposals will, also &quot;be- laid, &quot;before -you,,-: ifcirxramsiahcos permit, for-the ascertainment and regulation of profits In,-connectIon with thedistribution of milk and.other.necessaries of.lifefor the improve mo nt of. the road traffic of London.,the reform of-the system of valuation and ratingin England, and 7/e.les,  and of rating in Scotland,the improvement cf the administration of civil and criminal justice, and the consolidation ofcertain parts of the Statute law.And I pray that Almighty God may bestowHis blessing upon your deliberations.Y/hitehail Gardens, S.W.1.January 9th., 1924.
