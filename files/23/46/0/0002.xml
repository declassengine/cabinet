the proceeds of the principal exports of Germany to be handedover to the Allies;    in the occupied territories the Allies toundertake to collect the ceded resources,(The Belgian Ambassador had handed in three long notes andhad repeated tho French  request that the British  Governmentshould join the French and Belgian Governments in urging theGerman Government to abandon passive resistance to the occupationof the Ruhr;    he had also intimated that, while no amount for theGerman indemnity had been fixed in his Government *s note,  therewas a minimum amount below which the French and Belgian Govern-ments could not allow their share of reparation to fall.The Italian Ambassador had stressed M,Mussolini&apos;s desire for the re-establishment of the Allied front, and had asked forinformation as to the British Government1s attitude,She German Ambassador had asked for a private conversationwith Lord Curzon.The Cabinet agreed in the following proposals of theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs:-Ihat Lord Curzon should address a note to theFrench Government.in the following sense:-(i) Asking for a more precise definition of what was intended by the proposedrequest to the German Government fordesistence from passive resistance:fii) Inquiring what assurance could begiven to the German Government asto the position in the Ruhr if theywere to abandon passive resistance  their one weapon of defence;    and what were the views of the FrenchGovernment as to the future occupationor evacuation of that region:(iil) Examining the French proposals asto the bases of the suggested Alliedconversations,
2 3&apos;BgUSSIA. 2, The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed^ritrjjfrh the Cabinet that he had. received a farther note from theRelationsfith. Russian Soviet Government, in regard to the Russian trade agreement, which would, be circulated shortly to his previous colleagues.Reference:Cabinet 29 The effect of this series of notes was that theIS3) Con-elusions 2(b), Russian Soviet Government had giwan way on every point11, and Appen-Ilix.) with one partial exception. . In the latest note they had agreed to pay the compensation asked for, vis., 3,000 inthe case of Mrs Stan Harding,, and  10,000 to the widow ofMr Davison.    The Weinstein letters had previously been withdrawn.    The Russian Soviet Government had now agreedto concede, by an exchange of notes, our demands that theyshould not interfere with British fishing vessels outsidethe three mile limit of territorial waters, pending the regulation of the question by an International Conference.They had also accepted Lord Curzon&apos;s wider definition of propaganda in substitution for the original definitioncontained in the Russian Trade Agreement.   The only pointon which they had not given way completely to our point ofview was in regard to the transfer elsewhere of the RussianCharges d?Affaires in Kabul and Teheran, which Lord Curzonhad demanded in his note of May 29th.   M. Krassin, however,had admitted that the Russian representative at Kabul was. already at Moscow and would not return to his post.   Theonly case, therefore, in which our demands had not been completely conceded was that of the Russian Charge d&apos;Affaireat Teheran.The Cabinet agreed  $&apos; (a)  That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should reply briefly to M. Krassinin a note summing up the points on which agreement had been reached;    stating thatit was understood that, according to thearrangements made by the Russian soviet foreign Office, the Russian representative
!      2 at Kabul would not return to bis post?and notifying that if their representative at Teheran remained at his post and proof of further anti-British activities on his part came to our notice, we should insist on th.? application to his case of a generalproposal made by M. Krassin to apply mutuallyto such cases, namely, that the delinquentshould be expelled from the fiervicei(b) That the Foreign Office should -avail themselves of some later opportunity totake up with the Russian Soviet Governmentthe question of the return to Russia ofpersons whom, we wished to expel from thiscountry:   this question^ not having formed part of the Russian Trade Agreement, couldnot conveniently be taken up in the courseof the present negotiations.The Prime Minister, on behalf of th3 Cabinet, oongratu-lated Lord Curzon on the highly successful issue ofthese difficult negotiations.
QEE TURKISHPEACECONFERENCE.(previousHe ference:Cabinet 29(S3).Conclusion  (c)3,      The Secretary of State, for Foreign Affairsinforme&apos;.&apos;1 his colleagues that two points were still outstanding in connection with the Turkish peace-negotiations at the Lausanne Conference, viz,, thequestion of the pre-war debt, which the TurkishGovernment wished to pay in francs instead of in sterling, and the question of conces*sions, whichthe French Government hid insisted should be dis-cussed with the Turkish authorities at Angora by representatives of the parties interested.      The. Allied Governments had had to stand firm on thequestion of the payment of the pre-war debt.     IheTurks, notwithstanding the damage their attitudethreatened to inflict on their credit, remainedobdurate and threatened, to allow the negotiations to break do*n on this point,      Sir Horace Rumbold,however, was. in touch with, the representatives ofthe bondholders and was seeking a solution.      Thequestion of the concessions vouid probably have tobe dealt with by some general clause In the treaty and left over for settlement in detail later.
