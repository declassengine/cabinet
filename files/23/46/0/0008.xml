(S3) .CONCLUSIONS of a Meeting of the Cabinet,held at 10, Downing Street, S.W.1, onWEDNESDAY, JULY 11, 19S3,  at 11-30 a.m.-REPARATIONSDraft State-ment inParliament.(previous reference:Cabinet 35(S3), Con-elusion 1.)THE PROPOSEDPACT with france.(previous reference:Cabinet 16(S3), Con-clusion 9.)1. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave the Cabinet an account of a conversation he had held withthe French Ambassador on the previous afternoon, Tuesday,July 10th, the particulars of which are contained in a ,despatch to the Marquess of Crowe (Paris) handed round atthe Meeting^Paper C.P.-319(S3) .Lord Curzon dr-ew particular attention, as a matterlikely to interest the Cabinet, to a statement by theFrench Ambassador that the. French Government did hotregard the question of the Ruhr as in any way bound up with that of security, which they had not raised and didnot now desire to raise, since no danger could arise fromthe German side for many years.    Lord Curzon had addedthat the. Ambassador must not think that we would at anytime be indisposed to discuss the matter if the&apos; FrenchGovernment desired to put it forward.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs also gave a short account of a conversation he had had with theGerman Ambassador,mainly on the questions of sabotage andpassive resistance, in the course of which the german ambassador had given him the impression that the GermanGovernment would be prepared to withdraw their ordinancesif pressed by the Allies as a whole and if satisfied th---:-
the Ruhr -would he evacuated and the status our &quot;beforeJanuary 11, 1933, would approximately be restored.The discussion of the statement to be made in bothHouses of Parliament on the following day was adjourned until Noon on Thursday, July 12th, in order to give timefor the completion, circulation, and consideration by theCabinet, of the draft being prepared by the Secretary ofState.
IffRTSH COM-pJNSATION.^previous reference:Cabinet 33[(23) , Con-JjliSion 8.)2.   The Cabinet had under consideration the question of irish Compensation, in connection with which the following documents had been circulated:-A memorandum by the Lord President of theCouncil (Paper C.P.-298(23),A Memorandum by the Secretary of. State forfhe Colonies .(Paper .0.P.-306(33),...        .,  .A :Meroorandum by the Financial Secretary   ,to the Treasury (Paper C.P.-316(23).The Cabinet heard from Mr Ormsby Gore, the&apos; Paflia-mentary Under-Secretary for the Colonies, an account-of discussions he had held with the Irish Free Stats government during his recent visit to Dublin.   Full particulars ofthese conversations are contained in a Memorandum whichis to be circulated shortly.    The points on which Mr,QrmsbyGore laid stress were, that the position as regards paymentof pre-truce claims is quite definitely unsatisfactory;that the Wood-Renton Commission is proceeding rapidly withits work but that there is no corresponding activity on thepart of the Free State Government to make payments;    that up to the present only  1,500,000 has been paid out ofthese delays were 3,250,000 awards made by the Wood Renton Commission:,^due partly to a weakness in the machinery of the Free StateGovernment in making payments, and partly to the generallydefective machinery of government in regard to finance.There did not appear much chance of improvement in thismatter before the Irish Elections &quot;in September, but ifthe present Government were returned at those electionsthere appeared every probability that the Government, ofthe Free State would do something to improve matters.After considerable discussion, the Cabinet agreed  (a) That ;the Committee on Irish Affairs should consider and report to the&apos; Cabinet as to thepossibilities of accelerating the payment of awards in connection with pre-truce damages,including the possibility of utilising, forthe purpose of easing the situation beforethe Irish Elections, part of the  3,000,000included in the British Estimates for IrishCompensation, which, it was hoped, will bevoted by Parliament before the end of the session.       The Committee were asked to:-3-
take into account^ in -this connection,the importance of rrot taking any-action;,which could be quoted as a precedent for&apos; further advances on account of claims approved-for reparations against Germany:(b) That the Secretary of State for theColonies should give careful considers.-tion to a proposal that a frank con-  -versation on the question of compensation should be held between some representativeof the Government and some moderate repre-sentative of the Irish Loyalist Committee,in order fully&apos; to explain the Government&apos; position.
IRISH LANDPURCHASE.previous reference;Cabinet 28(2b), Con-elusion 8.)3. The Secretary of State for -the Colonies gave theCabinet an account of an interview he had had with a Deputa-tion of Irish Landlords, who.had-pointed out the disparity between the payments on account of Irish Land Purchaseto be rffide ty I:.&apos;jsh Oovsv-nv f nt under the Free State Act.1923, and the payments proposed under the 1920 Bill.   Thedifference was alleged to amount, broadly speaking, to  14on every  100 of rental.The Cabinet agreed  That the Committee on Irish Affairs shouldinvestigate this question, although, without.,much more information, the Cabinet could not possibly be committed to make any contribu-tion towards the alleged difference.
The Cabinet agreed  -To approve the introduction in the Houseof Lords of the British. Empire Exhibition(1924.)  Incorporated (Memorandum Amendment)Bill, 1923,( a draft of which is attachedto a Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor the Co 1 colonies (Paper CP.-303(23)),whichauthorises the payment of a salary to the deputy Chairman of the Executive Councilof the British Empire Exhibition.
