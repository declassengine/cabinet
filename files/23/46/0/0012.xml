(This Document Is the Property of Hia BritannicMajesty&apos;3 Government.)ij 0 RETCABINET 40 (25).CONCLUSIONS of a Meeting of the Cabinet,held in the Prime Minister&apos;s Room, Bouseof Commons, S.W.1, on MONDAY, JULY 23,1923, at 6-30 p.m.[8ECT0R-llERAL OPBIOALPICES! INDIA.1, The Secretaries of State for War and India brought before the Cabinet the question of the appointment of theDirector-General of Medical Services in India.The following considerations were brought to theattention of the Cabinet.   When a vacancy is about to occur, the Government of India report the vacancy to theSecretary of State for India, with their opinion whetherit should be filled from the British or the Indian Serviee,and the Secretary of State for -India decides the question in consultation with the Army Council.    In the case of anofficer of the Boyal Army Medical Corps, the officer isnominated by the War Office, with the concurrence of theSecretary of State for India.    In the case of an officerof the Indian Medioal Service the officer is nominated bythe Government of India.    The Army Regulations, India,provide that ordinarily the officer shall be chosen fromthe British Service, but the Government of India maynominate an officer of the Indian Medical Service (Note 23to Appendix XXII of the Army Regulations, India).   The EsherCommittee on Indian Military Organisation, 1920, recommendedthat the appointment should be held alternately by an officerof the Royal Army Medical Corps and the Indian Medical
Service, though the Secretary of State for India hadqualified his acceptance of this recommendation by acondition that a properly qualified candidate must beavailable.   At present the appointment is filled by anofficer of the Royal Army Medical Corps.   There is a veryserious shortage in the supply of British doctors to theIndian Medical Service, which reacts on the British element in the whole of the public services In India.    The induee-ments to enter the Indian Medical Service have beenreduced by the fact that this Is one of the transferredservices.   Prom this point of view it is important, as amatter of public policy, not to take any action likelyto discourage the Indian Medical Service.   The sameconsideration applies to the Royal Army Medical Corps,for which also there is a very serious lack of candidates.The Director-General, of Medical Services has charge ofthe health of all the British as well as of the indian troops in India.    The Government of India has the financial responsibility, and the Secretary of State for India hasthe Parliamentary responsibility connected with the appoint-ment. &quot;Pull particulars were given of the respective quali-fications and experience of the two candidates, who weresupported,in the one case,by the Government of India withthe approval of the Commander-in-Chief of the Forces inIndia, and in the other case by the Secretary of State forWar and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff.   The WarOffice nominee was senior in age by eight months, and a major-General with a somewhat wider experience of whitetroops than the Indian Government&apos;s candidate, particularlyin the Great War,   The Indian Government&apos;a nominee was aColonel, with long experience of Indian conditions.His appointment would result in his passing over the head
1 &apos;R9x y mof his own Commanding Officer, and in the Indian medical service having seven Major-general a and the Royal ArmyMedical Corps only two in India.   He would, however, beable to hold the appointment for a longer period of time than the War Office candidate, and possessed adequatequalifications for the post.The Cabinet agreed --That, in view of the &quot;recommendation of theRsher Committee on Indian Army organisation in favour of the post of Director-Generalof Medical Services in India being heldalternately by an officer of the IndianMedical Service and the Royal Army MedicalCorps, and in view of the importance of doing nothing to discourage the IndianMedical Service,- the post should be filled by an officer of the Indian Medical Service.
2.    The Cabinet had before them the following documents relating to the Treatment of Indians in Bast Africa:-Telagrams between the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies and the Prime Ministerof the Union of South Africa, sent throughthe Governor-General of the Union (paper g.P .-325(23)):A Memorandum by the Secretary of State forthe Colonies, covering a Memorandum givingin Part I an historical summary of thequestion, and in Part II a statement ofgeneral policy and the decisions on particular points at issue, to which the duke of Devonshire invited the concurrence of his colleagues (Paper CP.-334(23)) ;A Note by the Secretary of State for India,covering a telegram from the Viceroy dated july 16th (Paper CP,-335(23)) ;A Note by the Secretary of State for theColonies covering certain amendments which,after further consultation with the Secretaryof State for India, he desired to make inhis earlier Memorandum (Paper CP.-337(23)).After the Secretary of State for the Colonies had made a full statement of his proposals, as recorded inthe above documents, and the Secretary of State for india had set forth the Indian point of view and had warned theCabinet that, notwithstanding the inclusion in the agreementof important concessions to Indian sentiment, considerabledisappointment was likely to be caused in India by thesettlement, the Cabinet agreed   h(a) To approve the settlement contained in paper C.P.-334(23) as modified by paper cp.-337(23) :.(b) That the amended Memorandum contained inthe above Papers should be published asa Parliamentary Paper on July 24th.ffA.^Treat-nt ofliansBastric a.eviousfarence:binet 393), Con-ns ion 4.)
