appendix.To the Electors of Bawdlay.ladies and Gentlemen,In submitting myself to 3rou for&apos; re -election Ipropose frankly to put before you the present situation as I sea it and the measures which in tho opinion ofmyBelf and zay colleagues are necessary adequately zodeal with it.1. The unemployment and under-employment which ourworking people and our great national industrial aro nowfacing for the fourth winter in succession, on a scaleunparalleled in our history, hare created a problem whichcalls urgently for a solution,,    Their indefinitecontinuance threatens to impair permanently the trainedskill and the independent spirit of our workers , todisorganise the whole fabric of industry and credit, and,by eating away the sources of revenue, to undermine thevery foundations of our national and municipal life.2. In large measure this state of affairs is due to thepolitical and economic disorganisation of Europe consequent on the Great War.    In accordance with the policy affirmedby the Imperial Conference we shall continue to devoteevery effort, through the League of Nations and by every other practicable means, to the restoration of a truepeace in Europe.    But that at the best must take time.A year ago Mr. Eonar Law could still hope that a moresettled condition of affairs was in prospect, and thatwith it trade might enjoy a substantial and steady revival,.even inthe/
*5 p nthe absence of any modification of fiscal policy,  of theultimate necessity of which he himself was always convinced.Since tho occupation, of the Ruhr it has become evident thatwe are confronted by a situation which,    even if it does notbe-ooma worse, is not likely to be normal for years to come.The disorganisation and poverty of Europer. accompaniedby broken exchanges and by highar tariffs all the world over,have directly and indirectly narz*owed the whole field of our foreign trade.     In our own home market    the bounty givento the importation of foreign goods by depreciated currencies,and by the reduced standard of living in many European countries has exposed us to a competition which is essentially unfairand is paralysing enterprise and initiative.       It is underEn oh conditions that v?e have to find work for a population which, largely owing to the cessation during the war periodof tho normal flow of migration to the Dominions, has in thelast census period increased by over a million and three quartersouls.Do Government with any sense of responsibility could continue to sit with tied hands watching the unequal strugglewhichof our industries or content itself with palliatives/ valuableas they are to mitigate tho iiardship to individuals, must inevitably add to the burden of rates and taxes and therebystill further weaken our whole economic structure.     drastic measures have become necessary for dealing with presentconditions as long as they continue.
5..- The present Government hold themselves pledgedby Mr,. Bonar Law not to make avy fundamental changein the fiscal system of the country without consulting the electorate.      Convinced), as I am, that only by such a change can a remedy be found,.and that no partialmeasures such as the extension of the Safeguarding ofIndustries Act,  can meet the situation,  I am in hsjiour.bound to ask the. people to release us from this pledgewithout further prejudicing the situation by any delay.That is the reason,, and the ftnlv reason,   which has made this election necessary,,6.. What we propose to do for.the assistance ofemployment in industry,, if the nation approves,  is toimpose duties on imported manufactured goods, with thefollowing/
mobjects:(1)    to raise revenue by methods leas unfair to our own home production which at present bears the whole burden of local and national taxation, includingthe cost of relieving unemployment.(2)    to give special assistance to industries which siresuffering under unfair foreign competition.(3)    to utilise, these, duties in order to negotiate for areduction.of foreign tariffs in those directionswhich would most, benefit our export trade.(4)    to give substantial preference to the Empire onthe whole, range of our duties with a view to promoting the continued extension of the principle of mutualpreference which has already done so much for theexpansion of our trade, and the development, inco-operation with the other-Governments of the Empire,of the boundless resources of our common heritage..Such a policy will defend our industries during thepresent emergency and will enable us, as more normal conditionsreturn, to work effectively to secure a greater measure oireal Free Trade both within the Empire and. with foreigncountries.     Trade which is subject to the arbitrary interferenceof every foreign tariff, and at the mercy of every disturbancearising from the distractions of Europe,  is in no sense free,and is certainly not fair to our own people.8.
It is not our intention, in any circumstances, toimpose any duties on wheat, flour, oats, meat (includingbacon &amp; ham), cheese, butter or eggs.While assisting the manufacturing industries of thecountry we propose also to give a direct measure of support to agriculture.     Agriculture is not only, in itself, thegreatest and most important of our national industries,hut is of especial Yalua as supplying the most stable andessentially complementary home market for cur manufactures.We propose to afford this assistance by a bounty of 1 an acre on all holdings of arable land exceeding one acre.The main object of that bounty is to maintain employment on the land and so keep up the wages of agricultural labour.In order to make sure of this we shall decline to pay thebounty to any employer who pays less than So/- a week to anable-bodied labourer.The exclusion from any import duties of the essential foodstuffs which I have mentioned, as well as of raw materials,undoubtedly imposes a certain limitation upon the fullestextension of Imperial Preference.    But even the preferencesagreed to at the recent Economic Conference within our existing fiscal system, have been acknowledged as of thegreatest value by the Dominion representatives, and ourpresent proposals will offer a much wider field, the valueof which will be progressively enhanced by the increasingrange and variety of Empire production.
Moreover in the field of Empire development,  as wellas in that of home agriculture, wo are not confined to theassistance furnished by duties.     We have already given an earnest of our desire to promote a better distribution ofthe population of the Empire through the Empire SettlementatAct, and/the Economic Conference wo have undertaken toco-operate effectively with tho Government of any part ofthe Empire in schemes of economic development.     Moroespecially do we intend to devote our attention to thedevelopment of cotton growing within the Empire, in orderto keep down the cost of a raw material essential to ourgreatest exporting industry.These measures constitute a single comprehensive and inter--dependant policy.     Without additional revenue we cannot4assist agriculture at- home, but the income derived from thetariff will provide for this and leave us with means whichcan be devoted to cotton growing and other development inthe Empire, and to the reduction of the duties on tea and sugar which fall so directly upon the working class household.For the present emergency, and pending the introductionof our more extended proposals, we are making, and shall   &apos;continue to make, every effort to increase the volume of workfor our people.       The Government are sending very large sumson every measure of emergency relief that can help in thisdirection.     Further, the local Authorities of all kindsthroughout the country, and great individual enterprises, suchas the railways, with the assistance of the Government,  oron its invitation, are co-operating whole-heartedly in thenational endeavour to increase the volume of employment.    this great combined effort of the Government, of the Local .Aiit ho ritesand of individual enterprises,  represents an expenditure ofno less than 100 millions sterling.
The position of shipbuilding, one of tho hardesthit of all our industries, is peculiar.    It can, only,recover as shipping revives with the development of Empireand foreign trade which we believe will follow from ourmeasures,,    We propose in the meantime to give it special assistance Toy accelerating the programme of light cruiserconstruction which will In any case become necessary anthe near future.   We are informed by our Naval advisersthat some 17 light cruisers will be required during thenext few years in replacement of the County class, as wellas a variety of smaller end auxiliary &quot;draft; and we Intendthat a substantial proportion of these shall be laid downas soon as the designs are ready and Parliamentary sanctionsecuredoThe solution of the unemployment problem is the key to every necessary social reform.    But I should liketo repeat my conviction that we should aim at there organisation of. our various schemes of insurance againstold age, ill health and unengiloymento   More particularlyshould we devote our attention to Investigating thepossibilities of getting rid of the inconsistencies andthe discouragement of thrift at present associated withthe working of the Old %e Pensions AoU    The encouragement of thrift and independence must be the underlying principleof all our social reforms.
