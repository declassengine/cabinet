CP. 278 (23).APPENDIX.PRE-WAR PENSIONS COMMITTEE.REPORT.Constitution and Terms of Reference of Committee.IN pursuance of an announcement made on the 23rd April, 1923, by theChancellor of the Exchequer in the House of Commons that the Government had decided to introduce legislation with the object of improving the scale of pensionsincreases granted to pre-war pensioners under the Pensions (Increase) Act, 1920, theCommittee was constituted as follows : The President of the Board of Education (Chairman),The Secretary of State for Air,The Financial Secretary to the Treasury,The Parliamentary and Financial Secretary to the Admiralty,The Financial Secretary to the War Office,Mr. R. B. Howorth (Secretary),with the following Terms of Reference : To prepare for the consideration of the Cabinet, with as little delay aspossible, a detailed scheme for improving the scale of pensions increasesgranted to pre-war pensioners under the Pensions (Increase) Act, 1920.The Under-Secretary of State for Air has taken the place of the Secretary ofState for Air owing to the inability of the latter to attend meetings of the Committee,and the Postmaster-General was added to the Committee on the 31st May, 1923.2. The Committee have carefully considered the Report (OP. 1237), dated the7th May, 1920, of the Pre-War Pensions Committee of that year, on which thePensions (Increase) Act, 1920 (in this Report referred to as &quot; the Act of 1.920 &quot;), was based; a Memorandum (CP. 1517) by the then Financial Secretary to the Treasury,and also various memoranda submitted to them by the Treasury and other Depart-ments concerned with the administration of pre-war pensions.The Act of 1920.3. The Cabinet will remember that the Act of 1920 was intended to relieveexceptional cases of hardship among pre-war pensioners, due, for example, to age andinfirmity, and that the pre-war pensioners in question fall into the following main categories:  (1.) Naval and Military pensioners.(2.) Civil Service pensioners.(3.) Police pensioners.(4.) Ex-Teachers. ,Except as regards Ireland (as to which see , paragraph 15 below) the Exchequerbears the whole cost of the pensions in (1), (2) and (4), and a moiety of the costin (3). The Act of 1920 also empowered Local Authorities to increase the pensions of their pre-war employees (see paragraph 14 below).[10167 a] b
4. The main features of the Act of 1920 may be briefly summarised as follows : (a.) (1.) The Act applied to pensioners* who, on the 16th August, 1920, were inreceipt of pensions granted before the 4th August, 1914, and also to persons discharged to pension after the latter date who would otherwise be receiving less than the pre-war pensioner who obtained the benefit ofthe Act.(b.) The increases authorised by the Act were as follows :  Grade 1.--Pensions of  50 or under to be increased by 50 per cent.Grade 2. Pensions of  51 to  100, or, if pensioner married, of  51to  130, to be increased by 40 per cent.Grade 3  Pensions of  101 to  150, or, if pensioner married, of  131to  200, to be increased by 30 per cent.(c.) The benefits of the Act were subject to compliance with the following conditions:    -(i.) The pensioner must reside in the British islands,(ii.) He must have attained the age of 60 (40 for widows) or haveretired earlier for disability,(iii.) His means, including his pension, must not exceed  150 perannum if single or  200 per annum if married.Number of Pensioners and Cost of Act of 1920.5. The 1920 Committee estimated that, if means other than pension and contributions from Local Authorities in respect of police&apos; additions were altogetherdisregarded, the number of pensioners in receipt of pensions of  200 and undercharged wholly or partially on the Exchequer who might benefit under the Act wasabout 100,000, that the cost of their pensions was  4,280,000 per annum, and(assuming that all would benefit under the Act) that the cost of increasing their pensions Avould be about  2,000,000 per annum.After taking account of deductions for private means, &amp;c , it would appear fromthe latest available figures that the net cost to the Exchequer of the Act of 1920 is approximately  1,000,000 per annum. The number of pensioners comprised in the classes mentioned in paragraph 4 (b) above is on the basis of the 1020 returns Grade 1 ... ... ... ... ... ...     69,000Grade 2 ... ... ... ... ... ...     26,000Grade 3 ... ... ... ... ... ...      3,000Of these, about 55,000 are Naval and Military Pensioners, the great majority(47,000) of whom fall into Grade 1. &apos;The Objections to Wide Modification of the Act of 19&apos;.J0.6. The Committee have assumed that their Terms of Reference only contemplatea revision of the Act of 1920 in respect of the scales of percentage increase, leaving the Act substantially untouched in other respects.The Committee attach very great importance to the maintenance of the statutoryconditions as to residence, age and means limits indicated in paragraph 4 (c) above,which were designed to secure, and have in fact secured, the carrying into effect ofthe intention of the Act of 1920 to relieve only exceptional cases of hardship amongpre-war pensioners. Not only would any substantial amendment of the statutoryconditions involve a very large increase of cost to the Exchequer, but the Committeeare advised that it would so enlarge the scope of the Bill as to admit of wide discussionof highly complicated and contentious questions, and make it difficult, if not impossible,to secure the passage of the Bill into law this session.Recent Debate in the House of Commons.In this connection it will be remembered that on the 16th May, 1923, Mr. JohnRobertson moved the following Motion in the House of Commons : &quot; That, in the opinion of this House, the provisions of the Pensions (Increase)Act, 1920, are inadequate to meet the needs of pre-war pensioners, and further* Note. The Act iu terms applies to (a) pensions granted under the Superannuation Acts, (b) ex-teacherpensioners and (c) Irish police pensioners. Its benefits were extended by Order in Council and royal warrant respectively to the Naval and Military pensioners.
60olegislation should be passed to augment the increases allowed by that Act and toamend other provisions of a limiting and restrictive character which havedisqualified many deserving pensioners from receiving benefit under the Act &quot; ;and that in the course of the Debate the late Financial Secretary to the Treasurysuggested that the discussion had dealt with many matters of administration ratherthan with matters which pertained to the Motion. After assuring the House that the motion, generally speaking, coincided with the &quot; already announced decision of theGovernment that there should be an enquiry into, and future legislation regarding,the increased pensions of those whose pensions had already been somewhat increasedby the Act of 1920,&quot; Major Boyd-Oarpenter remarked that the general principle underlying the Motion &quot; is generally accepted by the House, and is certainly acceptedby the Government,&quot; and that it was only necessary for him to point out that, whatever the decision of the Cabinet might be, it would be quite impossible, under any methodof modern legislation, entirely to remove some of those anomalies to which referencehad been made.While the late Financial Secretary repeated this warning at the close of his speech, it is not unreasonable to suppose that the general impression left on the minds of many Members was that many of the anomalies and hardships to which referencehad been made would be greatly mitigated.The limiting and restrictive provisions referred to in the Motion are no doubt thefollowing: Private Means Restrictions. The total abrogation of the means limits woulddepart from the principle (underlying the 1920 Act) of confining increases to persons with total incomes below a subsistence level, and would cost (1)  552,000a year if the increases were still confined to persons with pensions not exceeding 150 for unmarried men and  200 for married men, and (2; a much larger sum,running into millions, if all pensions and retired pay, whatever the amount, were allowed, as has been proposed, to benefit by the increases.Age Limits. The lowering of the age qualification is pressed by the Policepensioners. Special treatment for the police in this matter is out of the question,and the Committee are informed that the Home Secretary does not support theproposal.Residence within the British Isles. The proposal to abolish the condition that,in order to receive the benefits of the 1920 Act, a pensioner must reside withinthe British Islands is objectionable on the following grounds : (1.) The increased cost of the proposal is estimated at approximately  60,000per annum.(2.) The proposal, if adopted, might widen the scope of the Bill.Local Authority Discretion.  The objections to modifying the existing provisions of the 1920 Act relating to Local Authority discretion are fully set: outin paragraph 14 below.Mitigation of Administrative Hardships.After careful consideration, the Committee, while of opinion that no alteration ofthe provisions of the existing&apos; Act dealing with the above matters is desirable, considerthat certain -hardships and anomalies can and should be removed by administrative action. In this connection representations have been made to the Committee as to thenecessity of revising the existing arrangements under which means are assessed onthe basis of last year&apos;s income, and it has been urged that declarations as to thecurrent income of pensioners should be accepted provisionally, subject to the recovery of any over-issue. The Committee understand that this particular anomaly can be metunder existing Treasury regulations, and has been satisfactorily met by most Depart-ments, and that it is not anticipated that there will be any difficixlty in removing the hardship in other cases.The Demand for Increased Benefits.7. A claim commonly put forward by the representatives of the pre-war pensionersis that the existing percentages of 50 per cent., 40 per cent, and 30 per cent, under the1920 Act should be increased to 75. per cent., 60 percent, and 45 per cent, respectively.[10167] b 2
The acceptance of this proposal would cost approximately an additional  500,000per annum, a sum considerably in excess of the maximum amount which theCommittee understand the Chancellor of the Exchequer is able to find for thisparticular service. The proposal is, moreover, open to the very serious objection thatif adopted the result would be in very many cases to bring the total pension of thepre-war pensioner above that of his colleague who retires at the present day withthe same length of service. This difficulty, which, indeed, has already arisen in certain.:cases under the 1920 Act, cannot be altogether avoided, but. its more serious conse-quences can be minimised by the grant of a substantially smaller percentage increasethan that indicated above and by inserting a provision in the new Act to the effectthat in no case should the increase now to be granted operate so as to bring the totalpre-war pensioner&apos;s pension above that of his present day colleague retiring with thesame length of service. In this connection it should be remembered that in August1920, when the Act of 1920 took effect, the cost of living figure was 155 per cent,above pre-war, while the present cost of living figure is 69 per cent, above pre-war a fall of 50 per cent.Increased Benefits Proposed by the Committee.8. After careful consideration of various alternatives the Committee consider thatthe solution least open to objection is one which will, in the main, benefit the smallerpensioners and particularly the small Army and Navy combatant pensioners;90 per cent, of these latter pensioners are in receipt of pensions of  50 per annum and under, and a very great majority of these receive basic pensions of less than 25 per annum. The Committee consider that these cases might well be met bya special rate of increase for pensions not exceeding  25 per annum, though theincrease would, of course, be a general one, applicable to all classes of pensioners, andwould be justified in the House as a measure for helping the poorest pensioners andnot as a measure to help Army and Navy pensioners in particular.9. (i.) The Committee are impressed with the desirability of avoiding thenecessity of quarterly reassessment of the increases in future years, as (1) the cost andtrouble involved would be disproportionate to the results obtained, and (2) theadoption of the proposal for reassessment would lead logically to the demand that the&quot;pre-war&quot; pensions affected should all be raised now to the full level of currentpensions if the cost-of-living increase justifies such a figure. Reassessment can be avoided in the case of Civil Service pensioners by the operation of the fixed over-riding maximum proposed in paragraph 13 below, and by restricting the new increasesso as to leave the total &quot; pre-war &quot; rates, so far as possible, at a figure somewhat belowthe current pensions on thirty years&apos; service or upwards. In order to secure the fulfilment of this latter condition it is essential that no further increase should begiven in the case of pensions in excess of  100 per annum. Having regard to thefalling cost of living and the reduction in current pensions consequent on this fall,there is, in the Committee&apos;s view, no case for augmenting the present increases on&quot; pre-war &quot; pensions above  100 per annum, particularly if periodical reassessment inthese cases is not insisted upon.(2.) Per contra, it will be remembered that the Pre-war Pensioners association has now claimed that the 1920 Act should be extended to pensions not exceeding  500a year ; but any such proposal is outside the Committee&apos;s terms of reference, and inany case the Committee assume that the proposal, which would be extremely costly, iBimpracticable.10. The course indicated in paragraph 9(1) above can be defended on the grounds that there must be the same scale of increase throughout all the Services affected ; that both to keep down the cost and to avoid reassessment as the cost of living falls, thetotal pensions (including increase) must be kept on an average below current rates,and that in the Civil Service (to which most of the pensions above  100 per annumbelong), the existing rates of increase on pensions above  100 per annum are as high as can safely be conceded from this point of view. The Committee are informed thatin most of these particular cases existing increases have raised the pre-war pensionsvery nearly to the current rates on 30 years&apos; service and that a comparatively small increase would bring them above current rates on 40 years&apos; service. Such a result is undesirable and would make recalculation inevitable in future.
The Proposed Neio Percentage Increases.11. The Committee, following the precedent set by the 1920 Committee, propose the grant of the following progressive percentage increases : Pensions of  25 a year or less. The percentage increase to be raised from50 to 70 per cent.Pens ions of  26 to  50. The percentage increase to be raised from 50 to65 per cent.Pensions of  51 to  100. The percentage increase to be raised from 40 to50 per cent.Pensions above  100 to continue to receive the increases given by the 1920Act without any further addition.These proposals will give an increase of  3 12s. per annum, over and above the-existing increase, to pensioners with pensions of  18 per annum (e.g., to the old ArmyPrivates with a pre-war pension of 7s. per week), rising to a maximum increase of  8per annum, over and above the existing increase, to pensioners with pensions of  100per annum. The total increased cost to the Exchequer is estimated at approximately 250,000 to  300,000 per annum.*Recommendations.12. Having regard to the considerations discussed in the preceding paragraphs,the Committee recommend (1.) That, except so far as may be necessary to give effect to the proposals in (2)below, no substantial alteration be made in the provisions of the Act of1920, and in particular that the reqiarements of that Act as to (a) privatemeans restrictions ; (6) age limits ; (c) the exclusion of pensions grantedsince the 16th August, 1920 ; and (a) residence in the British Islands,remain intact.(2.) That the requisite legislation be obtained forthwith to enable the pensionauthority to increase the benefits of the 1920 Act as follows.: Grade 1.

Pensions of  51 to  100 per annumPensions above  100 per annum to continue to receive the increases given by the 1920 Act without any further addition.The War Office and Admiralty should be authorised by theGovernment to grant similar increases, by Order in Counciland Royal Warrant respectively, in the case of Naval andMilitary pensioners eligible for the benefits of the 1920 Act.(3.) That on the assumption that the Bill will be passed before the autumnrecess, the enhanced rates of increase be made payable as from the1st July, 1923, and that in no circumstances should- those rates be madepayable retrospectively.The overriding maxima.13. As indicated above, the Committee attach very great importance to securingi;hat the new increase to be made under the Act should not bring the total pre-war pensioners pension above that of his colleague retiring at the present day with thesame length of service. It is certain that a development of this character would leadto an immediate demand for a revision of the current pension rates, the financialconsequences of which would be most serious.* Note. A table (Appendix I) is attached, showing the effect of the Cotnrnittee&apos;s recommendations onlCivil Service pre-war pensioners, and the extent to which the overriding maximum provisions indicated insparagraph 13 below will operate in their case. ,To be increased from50 to 70 per cent.To be increased from50 to 65 per cent.To be increased from40 to 50 per cent.
The Committee recommend That the proposed legislation should contain provisions for overriding maximawith the object of preventing the total pension of. a 1920 Act pensionerexceeding the pension of a similar pensioner retiring at the present day withthe same length of service. (! )Local Authority Pensioners.14. The Cabinet will remember that under Clause 3 of the Act of 1920 theTreasury were empowered to authorise the application of the provisions of the Act to^pensioners in receipt of pensions granted by any Police, Local or other public authority,and that thereupon such Police, Local or other public authority &quot;shall apply such provision to pensions granted by them.&quot; The Committee are informed that when theAct of 1920 was in Committee, &quot;assurances were given that the wording of the bill would compel local authorities to grant the statutory increases. After the passage ofthe Act. the then Law Officers (one of whom, when the Bill was in Committee, had given contrary assurances) advised that the power conferred on local authorities waspermissive and not mandatory. Certain local authorities have in fact never given the increases allowed by the .l!)20 Act, while some authorities have given smaller increasesthan the Act contemplated.The Committee understand that any proposal to modify the- permissive characterof the Act of 1920 would meet with local authority opposition on the ground that their pensions (except the Police pensions) fall entirely on local funds, and that it is there-fore for the local authorities to decide what increases, if any, to allow. For this reason the Ministry of Health are unable to recommend it. A possibly more serious objection is that a clause to give effect to the original intention of the 1920 Act would widen thescope and purpose of the proposed Bill.It has been represented to the Committee that the Police are in a somewhat different position to ordinary employees of local authorities, inasmuch as half the costof Police pensions is borne by the Exchequer.The Committee are informed that while a substantial number of Police authoritieshave not, for one reason or another, granted the full increase of pension allowed by the1920 Act, only four authorities have declined to grant any increase at all under that Actto their Police pensioners.The gross cost of granting to pre-war Police pensioners in England and Walesduring the year ended the 31st March, 1923, the increases at the full rates permissibleunder the 1920 Act in all cases would have been  256,556, while the gross cost of the increases actually granted during the same period was  23S,703. These figuresindicate the slight extent to which the Police authorities have failed to take full advantage of the 1920 Act and suggest the probability that they will adopt the newAct to much the same extent.The Committee are informed that the Home Secretary, with some reluctance, is ofopinion that it would be improper to modify the permissive character of the Act so asto differentiate in favour of Police pensioners, and that any such modification wouldbe strongly resented by the Police authorities.Having regard to these considerations, the Committee recommend (1.) That no alteration be made in the Act of 1920 with regard to the permissivenature of the directions to local authorities ; and(2.) That this conclusion can best be defended on the ground that the question ofincreasing the pensions of their employees is one for the local authorities concerned ; that it would be improper for the ibtate to attempt to coerce thelocal authorities in the matter ; that the figures quoted above show that, infact, the Police pensioners are, in the great majority of cases, getting theadvantages of the 1920 Act ; and that the State is doing its best to helpPolice pensioners, because, in the case of the Police authorities, theproposed new Act will empower the grant of the normal State contribution of one moiety of the cost of further increases in the case of those authorities which extend its benefits to their eligible pre-war pensioners.Irish Pensioners.15. Irish pensions fall into the following categories : (a.) Pensions (probably only the National School Teachers) paid by NorthernIreland direct out of its own funds. The existing pension increases tothese pensioners are met from the same source.
(6.) P ensions (National School Teachers and Dublin Metropolitan Police) paid bythe Free State direct out of its own funds. The existing pension increases to these pensioners are met from the same source,(c.) Pensions paid by the British Government, subject to recovery later, in wholeor in part, from Northern Ireland or the Free State, viz. : (i) pensions inrespect of Reserved Services in Northern Ireland (e.g., Revenue and LegalDepartments) ; (ii) the Royal Irish Constabulary; and (iii) pensions inrespect of Transferred Services, payable in the first instance by theBritish Government, in order to safeguard the position of pensioners. Inall these cases the existing pension increases are met in the first instancefrom British funds, but recovered later from Irish funds.The Committee are agreed that the proposed new increases must be secured to allIrish pre-war pensioners falling under head (c), as it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to distinguish between these pensioners and the similar British pensioners.They feel that, even should the Irish Governments refuse finally to assumeliability for these increases, the British Government might have to contemplatebearing the cost as a final charge. It will be seen from the messages in Appendix IIIthat, so far, the Irish Free State has refused to pay any of the cost, and that theGovernment of Northern Ireland has only agreed subject, in effect, to the condition that the British GoArernment reimburse the cost.The pensioners included in heads (a) and (6) are in a different position from theremainder, in that their pensions and pension increases are a direct charge on Irishfunds. They would, therefore, naturally look to the Irish Governments to award themfurther increases, if any, and any Imperial legislation for securing them such increasesmight be regarded as an interference in Irish affairs by the British Government.Nevertheless, the Government may be criticised for omitting to secure them the sameincreases as other pensioners, and the Committee have felt some doubt as to the course to recommend.The increases to the teachers under the 1920 Act cost  18,400 a year, and if thenew scale recommended by the Committee were applied to them, the additional cost would be about  6,000 a year. As the Superannuation Fund, out of which the pensionsand existing increases are paid, has been transferred to the Irish Governments, andthe teachers (though their pensions were awarded by the British Treasury) were neverState servants, and therefore have not the same claim on the British Government asold State servants, the Committee recommend that the further increases now proposedbe not extended to the Irish teachers, but the Irish Governments be left to award themsuch increases, if any, as they may consider due.The position with regard to the Dublin Metropolitan Police (whose increases underthe 1920 Act cost about  6,000 a year) is more difficult. The main arguments usedfor and against the application of the new Bill to them are as follows : I. For Inclusion.(1.) The British Government is morally and politically responsible for all the oldState servants, whether transferred to the Irish Free State or not. Fromthis point of view, the Dublin Police are on the same footing as the royal irish Constabulary, despite the fact that the whole Police Service (includingpay and pensions) has been transferred bodily to the Irish Free State,whereas the Royal Irish Constabulary were never transferred and their pensions are in the first instance a charge on British funds. If the Policepensioners had been paid their pensions, like the general body of Irishpensioners, from the Superannuation Vote instead of from the Police Vote,their pensions would have fallen under head (c) above, so that it is a mereaccident that their pensions are not in the first instance a charge on Britishfunds. It will be very hard on the Police pensioners to treat them on different lines from the Royal Irish Constabulary pensioners. Moreover, itis doubtful whether there is any legal warrant for the existing difference in procedure as regards the payment of Dublin Police pensions and otherpensions for service under the Crown in Ireland. So long as the pensions are in fact paid on the same basis in all cases no question is likely to arise,but any discrimination in the amounts of the pensions will invite challenge,and it is difficult to see what answer there would be to a Petition of right.
(2.) There is no guarantee that if the British Government fail to provide newincreases for the Police pensioners, the Irish Free State will put the matter-right by legislating themselves for the purpose.(3.) The Police can be distinguished from Teachers as the latter never were State-servants, and are paid their pensions and increases out of a specialSuperannuation Fund over which the British Government have no control.Ireland would resent any interference with the Teachers by the BritishGovernment.(4.) The amount at issue, probably not more than  2,000 per annum, is relativelytrifling.II. Against Inclusion.(1.) Despite the arguments at I (1), in fact the Police service has been transferredto the Irish Free State lock, stock and barrel and the pensioners are-no longer any concern of the British Government, but receive their pensionsand increases from the Irish Free State.   They should apply to the IrishFree State for any further increases.   Though it is true that it would behard on the Dublin Metropolitan Police if the Irish Free State refused to award them the new increases to be granted to the R.I.C., Sir F. Liddelladvises that the liability for Dublin Metropolitan Police pensions has infact been legally transferred to the Irish Free State by Article 12 of theTransfer of Functions Order, 1922, and that the effect of this Article andof Article 13 is to take away any legal right the pensioners may have hadagainst the British Exchequer (including any right under Section 57 of theGovernment of Ireland Act, 1920) as regards their existing pensions and increases, and to confer on them a corresponding legal right, if any, againstthe Irish Exchequer.   There can therefore be no Petition of Bight againstthe British Government, which has no legal concern with Dublin Metro-politan Police pensioners at all.(2.) If the new Bill excludes the Dublin Police, the Irish Free State will probablylegislate for securing them the new increases introduced in England, in-order to show that it is as generous as the &quot; foreign &quot; Government.(3.) Despite the arguments at I (3), the inclusion of the Dublin Police in the bill will weaken the case for excluding Irish teachers and will give the teachers-a new grievance against the British Government.    The fact that the teachers- were not State servants is not conclusive, for neither are theEnglish and Scottish teachers State servants.   The obvious &quot; clear cut &quot; isto exclude from the Bill all pensioners who receive their pensions and increases direct from the Irish Governments.   If Ireland will resent Britishinterference with Irish teachers, why not with Irish police also ?(4.) Under article 73 of the Irish Constitution, the British Pensions (Increase)&apos;Act, 1920, as originally passed, remained in force in Ireland like otherActs not inconsistent with the Constitution, but it operates in effect as ifit were a separate local Act.   If, therefore, the British Government amend the British Act, e.g.. by an alteration of the schedule, the effect on the Irish.Free State will be nil, and increases to Dublin Police pensioners can,,therefore, only be secured by the British Government if it inserts in the bill new section empowering it specifically to pay the new increases out of itsown funds to the Dublin Police.Any such section would be objectionable, as opening the whole Billto other amendments (e.g., with a view to compelling Local Authorities to-adopt the act of 1920) not barred by the terms of the Financial Resolution.It is much simpler to leave the Irish Free State to provide increases for its-own police.Ft will be seen from the above summary that there are substantial objections towhichever decision be arrived at. The Committee have arrived, with some hesitation,at the conclusion  -,That, despite the undoubtedly strong arguments in favour of providing increases,for the Dublin Metropolitan Police, the political, financial and administrativeobjections are too strong to be ignored, and the Dublin Police must b&amp;excluded, like Irish teachers, from the Bill.
Draft Bill.16. A draft Bill is attached (Appendix II) to give effect to the recommendations contained in paragraphs 12. 13 and .15 of the Report. The Committee are advised asfollows by the Parliamentary Counsel: That if the Bill is limited to the single point of increasing the percentagesmentioned in the Schedule to the Act of 1920, no amendments exceptamendments varying percentages would be within the scope of the Bill; anyother amendments would be out of order. If, however, the Bill containedany other provisions amending the Act of 1920, it is probable that, even ifthe title specified the particular or particulars in which the Act of 1920 wasamended, it would be held that the scope of the Bill was not limited to thematters specified in the title, and that other amendments of the Act of 1920were admissible, though involving corresponding amendments of the title.The Parliamentary Counsel adds, however, that the terms of the Financial Resolutioncould be so drawn as to preclude any amendment involving an increased charge on[Public Funds, though not other amendments.The Committee recommend the Cabinet To approve the introduction of the Pensions Increase Bill in the form of the draftset out in Appendix II to this Report.Signed on behalf of the Committee,E.

increase of the pensions which you will remember were increased by the Act of 1920.I do not know the details of the scheme which will be put forward, or how far towardscompletion it is ; but they have certainly not yet determined whether or not any increase which may be given to English pensioners should also be extended to Irish^The 1920 increase was given to both. It would be of great assistance to theCommittee, whose next meeting is early next week, if they could have before them an indication of the attitude likely to be adopted by the Government of Northern Irelandwith regard to the acceptance by them of the liability which would fall on them inrespect of their pensioners, should the Committee recommend and His Majesty&apos;sGovernment agree to include in the new Bill all pensioners, English and Irish, as was done in 1920.&quot;I understand that the Committee would probably recommend the inclusion of theIrishmen in the Bill if they knew that the appropriate Irish Government would pay their own people.I am not, I am afraid, in a position to give you the first thing for which you willlook, which is a figure, but I think that the increase which the Government ofNorthern Ireland already pays under the 1920 Act would not be increased by morethan one-third.(Signed) MARK STURGIS.II.Copy of Letter from Colonel W. B. Spender, Secretary to the Cabinet ofNorthern Ireland, to Mr. S. G. Tallents.Dear Tallents, Belfast, June 2, 1923.The Prime Minister has carefully considered &apos; your letter of the 30th May. It isnot quite clear whether the provisions of the 1920 Act enable the Imperial Governmentto introduce legislation involving additional charges on Northern Ireland in thisparticular matter, and it would appear that nny such legislation to be effective wouldrequire counterpart legislation on the part of the Northern Parliament. On general principles, the Northern Government is disposed to agree that any changes inGreat Britain must be followed in Northern Ireland, but it is of course understoodthat the Northern Government secures an equivalent set-off in it$ imperial contribution. As only twenty-four hours&apos; notice has been given of this matter,and the Attorney-General and Parliamentary Counsel of the Government of NorthernIreland are both in London in consultation with the Imperial authorities at thepresent time, it has not been found possible to give this question that full consideration which would have been desired.(Signed) W.
