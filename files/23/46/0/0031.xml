The Committee had under consideration a memorandumUy the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries (C.P. 475 (23)]which had been considered by the Cabinet earlier In the day(Reference; Cabinet 58 (23) Conclusion 5)*After hearing evidence as to the position v?ith regardto the present outbreaks of disease and as to the difficultiesattending research work on foot-and-mouth disease, the Committeecame to the following conclusions:&apos;       Siaughter policy .That unless some new factor arises, the present policyof slaughter should be continued, if necessary, until the netcoat of that policy reaches  1,500*000, then the question will again be considered by the Committee.2, Finance *That the Ministry of Agriculture should continue todraw on the Local Taxation Account for payments of compensationetc.     The Committee recommend, however, that the Local TaxationAccount should be recouped by an Exchequer Grant to the extentof half the net expenditure.     A supplementary estimate willhave to be Introduced into Parliament for this purpose.3. Salvage.Owing to the shortage of butchers in the Cheshire andShropshire area, it is becojuii^g   increasingly difficult toarrange for the immediate slaughter of affected and contactanimals.     The Committee, therefore, agreed that in this areasalvage of contact animals should be abandoned for the timebeing, the carcases of all slaughtered animals being immediatelydestroyed.     This ??ould permit of the slaughter of animals being undertaken by persons other than skilled butchers and wouldconsiderably aocelerate slaughter.     The usual procedure asregards salvage is to be resumed as soon as practicable.4, Humane Killer.The humane killer should be used wherever possible/
but where butchers insist on using the pole-axe and it isImpossible to obtain the services of other butchers who will use the humane killer, slaughter by means of the pole-axe willhave to be sanctioned,5. Research .The Committee considered that it was desirable thatthe Ministry of Agriculture should call in an eminent scientistto investigate their present methods of research in regard tothe disease, and it was decided that the Minister of agriculture ahould ask Sir Walter Fletcher, the Secretary of the british medical Research Council, to suggest the names of two or threescientists for the purpose.
