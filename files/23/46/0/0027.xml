*5 /! O- [CULTURAL 2o The Cabinet resumed their discussion on AgriculturalPOLIOS.Policy5 Laving before them the same documents as at theeviousfeference:Cabinet 54(23), Oon-conclusion 3o)previous meetingsAfter considerable discussions the Cabinet agreed  (a) To adopt, as a basis of their agricultural policy at the forthcoming General Election,the main lines of the Report of the CabinetCommittee (Paper 0oPo-456 (23)), that is tosay:-(i) That the system of subsidy shouldtake the form of a fixed sumat the rate of 20/--S per acre onall arable land:(ii) That as regards wages, it should be announced that the main object ofthe subsidy is to prevent the in-creasing unemployment of agricultural labour and the consequent fall in wages, but in any ca,se the subsidy&apos;will not be given to any farmer whopays a wage of less than 30/-s perweek:(ill) That as regards Wages Boards, membersof the Government (if pressed) should state that in districts where wagesrule above the mininum, it is confi-dently hoped and expected that thelabourers will in the ordinary courseobtain in their wages their share inthe benefit of the subsidy^.    In this regard It rests with the farmers to prove in practice what they have sofrequently maintained, - that WagesBoards are unnecessary for the purpose-But the Government must reserve theright, in case of necessity, to estab-lish machinery to secure that a fairwage is paid:(iv) That provision will have to be made toprevent agricultural rents being raised on account of the subsidy. There willhave to be some provision   for inspec-tion as a check on bad farming..(b) That the Minister of Agriculture and fisheries should have authority in his speech atCirencester the same&apos; day, to announce the abovepolicy, and that the Prime Minister should announce it in the House of Commons on thefollowing day.(c) That, insomuch as the subsidy to agriculture is to be furnished out of the proceeds of a customs Tariff which will be imposed in Ulsteras well as in Great Britain5 it is essentialto make some arrangement whereby Ulster will receive its appropriate share of the subsidy.But it will be for the Ulster Government
to decide as to the application of thesubsidy3 e. g. , they might prefer areduction of Ulster:s contribution.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed his colleagues that the French Government had ashed for aspecial meeting of the Conference of Ambassadors to takeplace on the following day, Thursday, November 15th, toconsider the question of the return of the Crown Prince toGermany, as well as the question of the resumption ofmilitary control, which they considered, in the circumstances,should be treated together.    As regards the Crown Prince,the French proposal was to ask for his surrender to themh Pro-Ills tofat as aIcriminalo Allied Governments as a war oriminalo    As regards thepMAMENTIeemany.)USarenoe:lj.net 38I. Con-lion 6o )resumption of control, which had fallen into abeyance duringthe disturbances in Germany, the French Government had alsoformulated drastic demands.    M. Carbon, on behalf of hisGovernment, had already notified the Ambassadors! conference that if satisfaction were not given by the German Governmentin both cases, sanctions must be exacted, either by theAllied Governments in concert,&apos;or, failing this, by theFrench alone (Paris telegrams Nos. 1004, 1005 and 1006, ofNovember 12, 1923).    They had suggested that if the sanctionswere taken by all the Allied Governments, some port, such asHamburg, might be occupied2    if taken by the French alone,the sanction would &quot;probably take the form of the occupationof Frankfort.The Cabinet felt that the interruption of military control was far more serious than the return of the crown prince.    They were advised that the return of the crown prince \vas not specifically prohibited by the Treaty ofVersailles, and they considered that to demand his surrenderas a war criminal would result in giving him an importancein German eyes which at present he did not possess.
As regards military control, the Secretaries ofState for Y-ar and Air got, into touch, by telephone, raththeir respective Departments and ascertained that thelast date on which control had been exeroised was June 28th.On that date British and Italian officers had undertaken with success two inspections allotted to them, but in thecase of eight inspections undertaken by French and Belgianofficers the results had been a failure and the officers had been refused admission to certain premises for thepurposes of inspectionAfter considerable discussion, the Cabinet agreed  (a) fhat the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should instruct the british ambassador in Paris to support the FrenchGovernment in -bringing home to the GermanGovernment the risk which they ran offomenting trouble in their own country andof disturbing the peace of Europe by havingallowed the return of the Crown Prince.    Heshould, however, make it clear that theBritish Government could not be a party tothe proposed demand for the surrender ofthe Cro&quot;n Prince as a war criminal.    Heshould also be authorised to supportrepresentations to the Dutch Government asto their share of responsibility for any difficulties which may arise subsequentlyfrom this event.As regards military control, Lord Oreweshould be authorised to support a strongaffirmation of the principle of control and inspection, as formulated in the first partof the draft French Note on this subject.He should further be authorised to proposethat inspaction should be undertaken for the&apos;present, on behalf of the Inter-allied commission of Control, by British and Italianofficers only, provided that the responsiblemilitary authorities on the Commission ofControl considered that this could be done without risk to the officers themselves.As regards sanctions, whether in regardto the Crown Prince or military control,the Ambassador should be instructed tomake clear that the British Governmentcould not associate themselves with theIntor-Allied sanctions proposed by theFrench Government, and could not acquiesce in the taking of separate sanctions, either by the French Government alone or in con-iunction with the Belgian Government:
(b) That the Secretary of. State for ForeignAffairs should take the opportunity ofan interview he was.to have that after-noon with the German Ambassador9 to makea strong representation as to the necessityof Germany carrying out her obligations under the Treat;/- and rendering possible a re-commencement of inspection.
