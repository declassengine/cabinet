OHAMB^HLAIS said that he had undertaken to givethe French an additional loan of  2,000,000 to carrythorn over until he was able to go to Paris to discuss thematter..   Ee desirea to know tho policy this Governmentwished to pursue.   He had had an urgent telegram fromH* Hotz to thlS same effect as a message received fromColonel House pressing for immediate assistance by theBritish Government.MR. JO.YU.ElS stated that the French were asking for650 million dollars from the United States and 100 millionpounds from Great Britain, partly in payment for goodssupplied and partly to support their credit with the restof the world.     $he Americans were firm that they wouldmake no loan for French expend!-tare on purchases madeoutside the United States of America.      he French wantedto gat credit from Great Britain and would accept it evenif it were limited to the purchase of produce from the-British Smpire, hut that would not relieve our exchangedifficulties and would merely tend to swell the burden -of French debt to us.     The 100 million pounds was partlymade up in money owed to Great Britain, partly for rawmaterials, and partly for restoring the general tffradebalance.      he French Government were keeping the francartificially at 26 francs to the pound, though owing tothe local inflation of prices if an article worth onepound were imported it could be sold for anything up to130 francs,     if the exchange were allowed free play the
-3-44&apos;   22value of the franc would fall to an unJcnown extent, certainlycertainly to 3*0 possibly even to 50 francs to the pound.Sphere was certain assistance we must render to the French,thepoint of doubt was whether we should give assistance forgeneral commercial purposes and for restoring their tradebalance in the world.     It was not worth doing- on a smallscale and on a large scale we could not afford it.     TheAmerican exchange had turned against us in the last ten daysand was now running at the rate of 2 million dollars a aayagainst us..  IB 3  KIMS was of opinion that the Americansshould be pressed to come to the assistance of the French. IfPresident Vilaon were in Paris he believed it could be arrangedIt was suggested that if the Breach wished to buy goodsIn the United hlngdora the best plan would be to hare a Frenchloan in this country, &quot;but it was pointed out that this wouldinterfere with borrowing by the British GoTemraent.MR. OEURGHILL stated his opinion that no money should beadvanced to the French except as a loan to provide payment for.the purchase of goods manufactured in this country.     GreatBritain had advanced vast sums for America and Trance and hadhad nothing in rettim.     We ought to offer to supply themwith the goods they required, but we ought not to burdenour credit apart from reviving- our own industry.MR. OEAMBERLAIfi pointed out that there were strongarguments even against Mr. Churchill&apos;s proposal.   Many of thegoods the French required were manufactured from importedmaterials, and also our own capacity for supporting theexchange would be lessened by an advance to -the French.MR * BOMR LAW observed that we could not allow theFrench to go bankrupt.MR. LQM stated his opinion that America should be toldthatplainly/they should come to the assistance of the French.
-3- 23 he War Cabinet decidedCl)  o approve the Chancellor&apos;a action in advancingii2,000,000 pending a Conference;(g)  hat the American Govsroment should be pressedto give financial assistance to France;(3)  hat the Chancellor of the Exchequer should pro-ceed to Paris next week with the Prime Ministerin order to discuss the matter with M. Slots andColonel House.BBSflE FOE IS)   MR. CEAMBBK&amp;A2H Sa &amp; tt% m WAfcvatOdft that hisjUlCIUALLIHGmMY XBD        instructions with regard to the re-vietualling of GermanyWB1&amp;.were to give nothing except for cash.     He was of opinionthat it would be intolerable to have to apply to Parliamentfor a Tote of Credit to feed- Germany.     If any goods were toha supplied to Germany he understood that we should take cashfor whatever the competent Inter-Allled body thought itnecessary to send to Germany.      he question also arose as towhether we could take Austrian assets freely.     Congress hadrefused power to the United States Government to use Americanmoney for Austria.     She Austrlans had offered the BritishGovernment a first lien on certain assets, for example, saltmines and forests.     In the opinion of Mr. JCeynes the AustrianGovernment had behaved very fairly   in the matter,    heirdifficulty had been that If they tried to seise privatesecurities the owner immediately became a Yugo-Slav or aGaeeh and until the Peace terms were settled it was impossibleto define the limits of Austria.     Ke would propose a Vote ofCredit for 12% millions for feeding the war districtsgenerally which would include Austria on condition that FranceItaly and the United States of America participate *      heAmerican money might be earmarked for districts other thanAustria if they so desired.     We should take from Austriasuch securities as she could offer. HS PRIME. talSSSB said that Sir Robert Borden was ofopinion that unless something   were done, to feed Austriathere would be a disaster** bought we ough.- *   take&quot;** ^
* 2 4whatever risk any other country took ana that we ought to makean offer - that at any rate would absolve us.     We mustremember that we were keeping up the blockade which carriedwith it the obligation not to let the blockaded people starve.The War Cabinet decided that :-(l) Any goods supplied to Germany should bo suppliedonly&apos;for cash and on $he instructions of theeompetent Intor-Allled author!ty.(2) &amp; Vote of Credit should be proposed for feedingwa*f districts generally other than Germanyprovided that France, Italy and the United Statesparticipate,,(3.)
