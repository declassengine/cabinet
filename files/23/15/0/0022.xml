The Waa:-&apos; Cabinet had before them the Draft of aBill to remove the statutory limitation on the salar-ies of certain Ministers and to Increase the numberof principal Secretaries of State (G.T. 7848) anda Memorandum by the Postmaster General on the statusof the General Post Office 7801).MB BOHAE LKW explained that the proposal in effectwas to raise the salaries of the President of theBoard of Agriculture and Fisheries, the President ofthe Board of Education, the Minister of Labour, andthe Secretary for Scotland to the  5000 level.   Anundertaking in this sense had been given at -the timeof the appointment of the Ministers now holdingthese offices.     There was, he believed, a similarobligation In the case of the Fodd Controller, but,as that&apos; Ministry was only temporary, some specialarrangement might be desirable in that ease, suchas the formation of a pool.MR BARNES recommended the elevation of the PensionsMinistry; but the sense of the meeting was againston the ground that the administration, while difficultat the moment&apos;, would, at no very distant date, bevery largely reduced to routing.11th reference to the status of the Post Office,it was generally felt that the duties of the PostmasterGeneral were not more arduous than those of the Chair-man of the Board of Inland Revenue or the FinancialSecretary to the Treasury and that the change recommendedby the Postanaster General could not bo recommended toParliament.With reference to the position of the FoddController, it was not desirable to suggest that theDepartment was to be continued Indefinitely.     On theother hand, while It lasted, the post was one of
great responsibility sri difficulty and necessarilyopes to wMaapr^ad public eriticisfsa.
