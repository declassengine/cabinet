Were weimmediately to start, preparing for a further war?    It seemedto him that tho idea underlying the proposals was that anumber of articles which, before the Tar, had been manufactur-- ed in Germany,  should now be produced in this country.    Ifthis process was to be regarded as a future method of defence,It was difficult at the moment for him to express an opinionupon it.iYith regard to &quot;dumping&quot;, he thought that everyone wasagreed that we should adept a plan for the prevention ofdumping somewhat on the Canadian model.    In the first Memo-randum which hud been submitted (Paper G . T .--7904) thereappeared to be an extension of that policy. v-The President of the Board of Trade, interposing,said that the final policy as regards trade which his Depart-ment put  forward was contained in Paper G Ml.-7906,  and everyproposal which had appeared in his former Memoranda anddid not appear in that Memorandum had been scrapped as theresult of discussion.
-   207The First. Commiasioner of VForks,. continuing, drewattention to paragraph, 3 of Pope:.- G..T.-*7906, in which itwas proposed that the Board of Trade should schedule anyindustry which it night consider a hey industry when thenecessity arises, and should he empowered to prohibit theimport,, except on license, of the products of an industryso scheduled.    Sir Alfred Mond pointed out that the HouseOf Commons- had expressed themselves as extremely hostile togranting wide powers to Government Departments, and hethought it would be extremely difficult to persuade Parlia*merrt to agree to the course now suggested.   With regard tothe Second part of the proposal, namely, th&amp;t, in order toprevent an excessive profit from being obtained by theimporter in cases in which the import price is considerablylowei1 than the price ruling in this country, fees should becharged for licenses, regard being had., in the fixing ofthese fees, to the differences between the prices^ at whichthe articles could be imported and the prices at whichsimilar articles were sold in the United Kingdom, he saidthat this proposal would- have the affect of keeping up pricesagainst the consumer.    In effect, although no limitation wasbeing fixed for prices in this country, the importer would bodebarred from selling, hie articles&apos; at a price below that-decided upon by manufacturers in the United Kingdom;    butwhat every Party in the country was at present crying out forwas a reduction in the price of goods, and any steps whichwould have the effect of keeping prices up, even for the sakeof preserving particular industries, would be sharply /resentecHe thought,- too, that the industries which the Board of Traderegarded as key industries should be carefully examined; inparticular, the question of the magneto trade&apos; should be bornein mind.Mr&apos; Barnes stated that hp did hot see why magnetosshould not be uanufactursd in. this country as cheaply as inGermany.   &apos;lh -fast, the chief German manufacturer of thesearticles had learned his trade in England.
The First Commissioner of Torks, resuming, drewattention to the proposals in paragraph 4 lor the protectionof certain other unstable essential industries.    He statedthat this was a new proposition, and it was the first timethat the Government had been asked to impose a heavy prohi-bitive tariff on a large number of articles.   There was, inthe first place, the proposed tariff of 50 per cent, onchemical glass.    He felt that science and research wouldSuffer considerably by the high prices that would consequent-ly obtain.    Numbers, of Scientists had told him that theywould much prefer to use Zeiss- optical instruments to thoseof any other manufacture, as they were so much better.   Then,as regards the other scientific instruments upon which it wasproposed to place a tariff, were we going to maintain thehigh prices now demanded for these articles, merely in order-to preserve certain small industries?    It would be muchbatter to help them in some other way.    The proposed tariffof 33^/3   per cent, on rubber tyres would have the effect ofraising the cost of all kinds of transport.    -Tith regard togaa-manrles and mantle rings, these had been manufactured inthis country for years, and there was no reason why theyshould not continue to be manufactured sufficiently cheaplyto allow the industry to carry on.    Finally, there was theproposed tariff of from  5 to 50 per cent,  on certain speci-fied kinds of gauges and on dividing engines,    These werearticles of vital importance to engineering firms of allkinds, and no Free trader would look at the proposed tariff,especially since it had been promised that existing tariffswere merely temporary,   All the articles in the list towhich he had referred appertained to small industries whichcould be better helped in sons indirect way.The Chancellor of the Exchequer    intervened to statethat he had continued the MoKenna tariffs for the presentyear on the distinct understanding that their continuancewaa without prejudice to any proposals the Government mighthave to make when they came to consider their trade policyaa a whole.
The First Commissioner of Works, proceedings, referred-&apos;next to the question of State -o-o-operation with weak essen-tial industries (paragraph 5 of Paper G.T.-7906).    He wasvery concerned about the possibility that Germany might takeresponsibility for the re-construction and re-organisation   &apos;of industry in Belgium.    He could not see any reason, how-ever, for giving State help to the iron and steel industry.He could not agree that these industries were in a decrepitcondition and were unable to stand alone,    In his view,  asa matter of fact, they were better off than they had everbeen, and were quite strong enough to find their own finance,For example, the manufacturers of Middlesbrough would certainly not consider themselves as requiring anyone to step in andbolster up their industries.    It would be immensely dangerousfor the State to start mixing itself up in this kind of thingfor, once-started, there would be no end to the pleas forfurther subsidies and heavier tariffs.    In conclusion,  SirAlfred Mond stated that, as regards the whole of the policyput forward by the President of the Board of Trade, he wasof-opinion that the bulk of the ground would be covered by astrong anti-dumping policy, particular attention being paidto certain of the smaller industries which might be consider-ed of special importance.Mr Bonar Law said that he did not entirely agree withSir Alfred Mond&apos;s views as regards the iron and steel indus-tries. At present the price of pig-iron in America was one-third of the price of pig-iron in this country.    That did notmatter at the moment,  since there was such a heavy demand onhomethe KkGpce market, and Atlantic freights were so high;    butthe real point was whether we were going to allow our homemarkets to collapse when thefalMMSfell,  the demand diminished, and prices would naturally tend to fall als o, withoutGovernment interference.    Mr Bonar Law added that the con-tinuance of the present high rates of wages must inevitablydepend on the stability of our home markets.
The Firat Commissioner of Works suggested that itwould be impossible to maintain for very long the high rates6 of wages now existing.Sir Eric Geddes said he understood the Prime Ministerhad stated that the profits in the iron and steel industryat present were enormous.The Prime Minister agreed.   A representative man inthe industry had informed him,  in reply to a questick as towhat was wrong with the Iron and steel trade, that the pro-fits were too high;-   they were, in fact, higher than theyhad ever beerm:    and the result was inefficiency and waste.In particular,&apos;it&apos; was having a very bad effect in the brassfoundries, which were full of incompetent men receivinghigh rates of wages.    If profits could be c\it down it wouldbe the best thing possible for the efficiency of the industry..The Lord Chancellor suggested that the present was adistinctly bad time in which to try and reduce wages, in vieof the profits that the industry was making.The Prime Minister said that that was what hisinformant had told him.   The workmen were all aware of theprofits which the employers were making, and any attempt toreduce wages would consequently lead to considerable unrestamongst the labour classes.Mr Bonar Law agreed that the position was at presentabsolutely abnormal.&apos;   The recent increase in the price of coalshould have meant an increase of nearly  4 per ton in theprice of pig-?iron, but certain manufacturers had not found itnecessary to increase the price at all   so huge were theprofits that they had been making.    As he had stated before,however, those orofits were entirely due to the heavy homedemand and the high rates of Atlantic freights.
The Post Master General said that the Mark which stoodat 21 before the vrar was now at 72 to 76,      Unless we admittedgoods both the French and Italian Exchanges would get worse,as well as the American Exchange.     If, however, we allowedgoods to come In, our own industries must suffer, and hethought that a system of control would be preferable to this.The Prime Minister pointed out that the American Fxchangeacted as a tariff against trieifeelves,The. President of the Board, of Trade said there was abasic principle for the Mar Cabinet to decide, namely,- is Itdesirable that the industries in this country shall be sobalanced that wc can confidently face another war.The Secretary of State for Tar said, that he always re-garded the question of key industries as turning upon thiscountry&apos;s power to defend itself in a great struggle.    Thisargument, he thoughtr would over-ride any objections thatmight be raised to the Government f&apos;s policy of protecting thoseindustries *     He considered it necessary, however, to haveboth a Parliamentary and a practical check upon the supportgiven to key industries;    that is to say, these latter mustcome under some measure of control in order to balance theadvantages they would gain by State assistance.     Ho reasonableman, he thought, could object to this.      &quot;rIth regard to Para-graph 4 of Sir Auckland Geddes Memorandum, this frankly advo-cated protection pure and simple.      Certain trades wore dofinitly picked out for such protection.The President of the Board, of Trade pointed out that allsuch trades were Industries-which would be essential to usin war time.The Secretary of State for   ar, proceeding, said thata licence and embargo were less objectionable, in his opinion,than/graduated tariff, as they could be regulated.     The
Government could, always reserve to itself the right ofImposing an embargo, without necessarily causing violentfluctuations of trade *    Once the Government began to offerthe special assistance advocated In the Paper before the ParCabinet, all the affiliated trades would at once make similardemands either for a measure of protection, or for some ne-bate.     A general tariff did do justice as between onearticle and another,, but they had no means or intention ofimposing a general tariff.      He suggested that the &quot;arCabinet should follow tho War-theme throughout and put ontheir special list articles which wore essential to us Intime of war, and then proceed by licence and embargo and notby a tariff.Sir Eric Geddes referred to the question of OpticalGlass which a few years back had been c. negligible industryin this country.     A big British firm had then corns forwardand declared that if the Army, tho Navy and, presumably, theAir Force would undertake to purchase glass from them for aperiod of ten years after the war, they would, be. able to holdtheir own, and they promised not to Charge exorbitant price3.This offer was made without any regulation, licence or embargo.As Hr. Churchill had suggested It was possible at the sametime to assist an industry and also to keep it virilej but togrant a 50/.&apos; to 100 k&apos; protection would mean high costs and wagesand -would stifle development.Tho President of the Board of Education stated thatwhen he had. been at Sheffield. University he had founded aninstitute of Glass Technlcology and he had. been told that everyformula had been re-discovered two years ago.    The ResearchAssociation had also done excellent work, and he hadreason to believe that out Optical Glass industry was now ona stable f oiindatione
Mr, Bonar Law said that if tho Gorman. Exchange meanta triple subsidy, v;c were bound to protect our own people.The First Commissioner of &apos;&quot;orks thought that Article 14of Sir Auckland Go deles1 Taper covered many of tho questions,raised.The Minister of Pensions enquired vrhethor it would notbo necessary to take some special steps to equalise theGerman Tktchange.The Postmaster General pointed out that by embargoestho Government could open and shut the gates as they liked.Thatever policy they adopted was bound to be unpopular fend-itseemed that there was no alternative but to impose a strictercontrolmMra Bonar Law said that the Prime Minister had recentlyreceived a deputation of Protectionists.-   In the course of the*discussion he  (Mr.- Bonar Law) had enquired whether the deputa-tion thought that a tariff would he of any use, a questionwhich had elicited general applause.The Lord Chancellor asked what the President of the Boardof Trade had to say to tho proposal to confine our supportof British Industry to two classes of assistance, embargoesand licences.Mr. Barnes said that in one part of the -Memorandum theword &quot;shielded&quot; had been used, while in another viz. Article 4the expression was  &quot;ho recommended for tariff protection&apos;&apos;.-The President of the Board of Trade explained that thewhole basis on which, he had worked was  (if that we werebetween two worlds:&apos;    (a)  one world which, was much downhillwhichso far as Fxchanges were concerned, and &apos;(b) the..other/wasvery much up-hill,-     This put out of court tho question ofa general tariff, and (2) neve wo not to face the situationwhen we might once more be at war.The ford Chancellor interposed to say that In his viewthe Government in determining their policy must not neglect
this contingency a.The President of the Board of Trade,  continuing, saidthat there v.ras the further question of skilled workers whowere necessary for special industries.    The important pointwas, were we to support tho foreign Exchanged or not?   Aftorcareful consideration he and. his advisers had decided that thiswas not advisable and that, therefore, it was no use tinkeringwith them, except to prevent a complete collapse.    Consequent-ly they had to bear In mind that some of these Exchanges mightat some time or other need to be re-established.     Anotherpoint was that the American Exchange gave a groat stimulus toexports.      Ker-* there was the question of prevention of dumping %it was desirable to make our own industries as stable as possibleand. take steps to prevent their being swamped by sudden floodsindustries, which were dealt with in Articles 3,4,5:5 of hisMemorandum*     These, however, could not be dealt with all in thesame way.   The synthetic, organic, chemical industry was vitalfrom the point of view of war;    it was essential, for Instance,to manufacture of high, explosives and poison gas.    Inextricably    \mixed up with It wore the synthetic dyes  j    in regard to theselatter we had adopted a policy of licencing the importation ofdyes, and so far as our own industry was concerned we had com-plote powers of supervision and of controlling, and of limitingthe profits *    Tho Government contribution to tho capital of ourDye industry was  1,700,000;    capital value of the Gorman DyeOur Optical Glass industry was vital to us in the case of war.It was young at present but coming along well.    Its positionif faced by foreign competition was dangerous.    It had formidablecompetitors, in the first Instance, in Prance, and - in thebackground - Germany,    Ho thought that out optical glass could,not maintain its .position against tho Pronch, unless it worecovered as regards Opera and Raoe Glasses, where the Frenchcompetition was particularly keen.from outside.Further, there was the general question of keyindustry vwas  ISO,000,000 sterling at the old r ate of exchangea
Sir Auckland Geddes then referred to hosiery latchneedles, and said that,until we star-ted their manufactureduring the Te-r, we had no latch needles in England.   Theseneedles were essential for the purposes of supplyingclothing to the Army.    The position was that the Industry wasat present established on a small scale only, and had nomarkets outside this country.    It was not able, therefore,to stand by itself at present.    Turning to potash compounds,the President of the Board of Trade saLd that these wereessential for war purposes.    Magnetos were Important in themotor-car industry, .and he was informed that for many yearsour own magnetos would not be able to hold the marketagainst the. American and German product, because they couldnot be produced in sufficient quantities.   Tungsten was alsoindispensable for war purposes.The President of the Board of Education said that heunderstood that the tungsten, industry in. this country waswell^eataolished, and that enormous profits were being made.The President of the Board of Trade thought that theposition would not be entirely satisfactory for anotherfour or five ye%rs.The Prime Minister said that it would be urged      whyshould there be any necessity for Protection when practicallyall our industries were amassing huge profits?The Lord Chancellor thought that the Government, instatins its oollcy, must declare that it was necessarily ofa makeshift character, owing to the abnormal conditionsobtaining in consequence of the Tar.The Prime Minister informed the &apos;far Cabinet that aDeputation representing the iron and steel industries wereto have come to see himself and Mr Bonar Law, but they didnot keen the appointment.    On enquiry, he found that they haddecided to change their policy.The President of the Board of Trade said there was onevery important matter which required immediate decision, and
S Ithat was our policy in regard to our present restrictionson imports.    In the month of June our imports had amountedto  132,000.,000;    in July this amount had increased to 153,000,000.    If we removed restrictions   and. many ofthem must cose off   we should let in a great flood ofimports, the American Exchange would go heavily against us,and the price of food would inevitably no up.    In reply toa question, he said that our imports of food in June cost 59,000,000, and in July  72., 000,000.Mr Barnes enquired whether the Government intendedto go beyond the policy they had adumbrated in their mani-festo of last December,  before going to the country.   Themanifesto promised,  (a) that there would be no furtheradjustment to our fiscal system until the country returnedto normal conditions;    and (b) that we abandoned the prin-ciple of Free Trade only so far as dumping was concerned,and so far as it was desirable to stimulate productionwithin the Empire.Mr Bonar Law reminded Mr Barnes that the manifestoalso covered Key industries.Mr Barnes said that the policy recommended by thePresident of the Board of Trade launched the Governmentstraight into Protection as against Free Trade.2ir Bonar Law pointed out that Protection formed onlya vcy small oart of Sir Auckland Geddes&apos; proposals.Mr Barnes enquired why it was not possible for ourown people to came magnetos as cheap as they could be madein foreign countries,    The- answer was that we lacked theproper organisation, and this organisation would be renderedimpossible by the introduction of tariffs.    He did not mindthe Government assisting key industries by means of subsidies,provided that proper conditions were laid down. He himselfwas not prepared to subscribe to a wholesale tariff policy.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said tiaat Mr Barneswas. not - the only person who found himself confronted withdifficulties when considering-the future trade policy of the
country.    In his opinion, what tho Government had got to dowas to be prepared to scrap the past and see if they couldnot come to some sort of agreement as to the present.The Minister of Health considered that it was impos-sible to formulate any real plans until trade began to re-turn to normal conditions.   As regards&quot; Article 3, he thoughtthat key industries might be much assisted by labour-savingdevices and a bother syste.. of manufacture.    He himself wouldomit tungsten from the list, as he understood that therewere huge reserves of this product in this country, and col-ossal fortunes had been nude out of it.    In regard to severalof the industries enumerated in Article 4, he himself wouldbe inclined to adopt &amp;r Churchill&apos;s recommendations.The President of the Board of Trade said that thewhole of the key industries in Article 4 were vital warindustries,  and he did not think that the best way to protectthem was by means of license,    v/hen it was a question of bigconsignments,.tariffs were preferable to license.    Thedifficulties in the way of license were caused by the bulk,the -alue,. and the   complexity of the trade,    Proceeding,  hesaid that rubber tyres were not dutiable at present. Americanfirms had amassed, mainly at the expense of the British,enor ous resources,   and they intended shortly to flood thiscountry,and our own Industry was threatened owing to whatpractically amounted to British subsidies to American ma-nu-facturers.    Tyres, therefore, presented a special case.    Heagreed that the whole of this class of goods might be dealtwith by license without causing any trouble to the Governmentitself, but&quot;it would cause great irritation so far as thetraders were concerned.   As regards Article 5, he thoughtthan the Government was bound to provide seme part of thecapital for the spelter industry for five years or so, untilit could stand on its own legs.    Arising from, and closel;connected with,  this industry, cere the whole of the acid-IB-
&quot;  218industries.    In respect of copper there was no adequatecopper refinery in this country, and he thought it would be&apos;wise for the Government to take the matter in hand.The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought that the lackof refineries was due to our inability, before the Par, toget sufficient copper.The President of the  Board of Trade said that thecooper was now in British, and out of American, hands.The Prime Minister said that he thought that the dia-cussion that morning had been very instructive, and hadbrought out many different, but useful, points of view, inregard to the proposals of the President of the Board ofTrade.    He suggested that the war Cabinet might now adjournand assemble again at the same place at 4.15 that afternoon.He himself proposed that a small Committee of Ministers mightbe appointed to examine more closely Sir Auckland Geddes&apos;recommendations, and to see whether his proposals could bemodified, if necessary, in the light of the above discussion,so as to secure general agreement.Six&apos; Eric Geddes enquired whether spelter was notlargely a. question of freights.The. President of the Beard of Education asked whetherthe kind of supervision intended in Articles 3 and 4 was tobe in any. way different.The President of the Board of Trade replied that,incertain cases in Article 3, British capital was already em-ployed.    In those circumstances,  the Government would parti-oipate in the management of the Industry,    in other cases theGovernment would act in a supervisory capacity only.(the, gating n^Ltb^n^.u,ntll 4-151 ,tore-assemble al.th.at,.hour, in Mr Bonarla^Ms. Boom.
