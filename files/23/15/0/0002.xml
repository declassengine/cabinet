WAR CABINET  *ft2 A.DRAFT HIEUTES of a Meeting of the W.,r Cabinet hold onTHURSDAY,  13th February; 1919, at 1.0 Downing St.,,S,.W.at 12 Noon.P SITUATION IN (l)    With reference to War Cabinet  31A, theJSSIA. .......     .....Prime Minister read a Paper which, had been preparedby the C.I.G.S.  but was not ready in time for circula-tion to the meeting. ,The paper considered four different alternativepolicies which it was possible to pursue ;-(i)     Int ervention(ii)     Evacuation(iii)      Recognition of 3olBheviks andmaterial support(iv)      Defence of the Embryo States.But the Paper submitted by the War Office did notsupply the material T*hich the Cabinet required.      Itwas necessary to know That expenditure would beinvolved in each case.       He hpjJSd the War Officewould have some idea as to the amount of expenditureinvolved - It might be either  20,000 or  20,000,000.There were three simple propositions which hadbeen admirably stated by Lord Curzon.      In regard tothe fourth alternative &quot;the defence of the smallStates&quot;, he had stated quite clearly   that there wascomplete agreement among the Allies as to thedefence&apos; of the small States against the Bolsheviks oranyone else who might attack them.Lord Curzon said that there was both&apos; amilitary programme and a political programme.      Thepolitical programme was recognition,  but we had alreadyrecognised the Ssthonians, Poland, and General Benekin,
While fee had not recognised Koltchak, we had sent himvery friendly messages, and so far as. he   was awareevery one of the &quot;border Statea had had the only kind ofrecognition which it was possible to.give.      He wouldlike to know what the C.I.G.S. meant by &quot;recognition&quot;.So far a-: he was aware,, all that  could be done had beendone.The Secretary of State for War stated that therewas no doubt that the only chance of making headwayagainst the Bolsheviks was by the use of Russian armies.If Russian armies w^re not availabl&quot;, there was noremedy.      Large British and French Armies wi-r- not to bethought of,      There were already considerable Russianarmies in being, amounting in all to 455.000,  composedas follows :-      . &quot;Archangel ..........      25, 000Finland ......______.      35,000Eethonia...........     30,000Poland. ......._____.....     30,000Gen. Haller ........      30,000Gen. Denekin andKrasnoff ......... .    150,000Koltchak .....-----....     94,00013,00018,000oo ************  * ******   ***?*British ........14,000One of the extraordinary, factors of the situation wasthat, while Poland was being pressed on all sides by theGermans and the Bolsheviks, there were 30 divisionswaiting in France under General Haller which theAllies were being hindered from sending to Poland, byimproper representations mad.* by the German author!ti &quot;&apos;-&apos;*ho rv-fu8-&apos;-d to allow th*n transport over thn Danzig-Thorn railway.      In addition to this, the Russians hadplans for trying to increase their armies.      They were
$0^6   8aiming at an army of 1,000,000,      He was unable to Touchfor their troops or plans,  hut unless a definite policywere materialised there was no use going on?      Unless       ithe Russian forces could he made into an effective army,the whole undertaking was impossible.     He would put thefpllowihg question to the General Staff:-      Assumingthe -British Government were not prepared to send massesof men to Russia,  and subject to that limitation,  didthe General Staff consider there was a sufficient prospectof getting the Russian armies into a fighting condition?While he was not prepared to guarantee results, becausewe had to deal with Russians and their mqrsKL was&quot; not good,he felt that if we did not decide upon a policy we shouldhave a succession of disasters, followed by wholesalemassacres and the extermination in one way or another ofthe whole of the people who had been supporting us.    Ifwe were unable to support the Russians effectively,  itwould be far better to take a. decirion now to quit andface the consoque-nces, and tell those people to make thebest terms they could with the Bolsheviks, than to leaveour troops there and continue without a. policy.      Prinkipowhatever was thought of it, was a plan.      He did not agreewith it,  but if it had succeeded it would have led tosomething.      Assuming that Prinkipo was at an end som.tvtli.inmust tako its place.      Ho hoped it would bo possible,before President Wilson loft for Africa, to arrive ata decision.Th&apos;- Prime Minister r*ad a letter h* had wrlxton .to the British Empire Delegation,  in which ho had insisted
that the- Russian question should bfc discussed anddecided one way or the other before President Wilsonleft.      He had stated that if the Prinkipo propositioncame to nothing wo must decide what the alternativewas to ba.      It was unfair to the Russian peoples notto make up our minds, and a decision should not bemade in President Wilson&apos;s absence.      He was aversefrom going to Prinkipo to meet the Bolsheviks alone.On the other hand,  the other Russian groups would notconfer and oould not fight.      If Prinkipo wa-- to beabandoned, President Wilson ought to shar^ thedecision and fac* the re --ponaibility.     It was pointedout that one of the conditions of the Prinkipoahheme was that fighting should be stopped, but theBolsheviks, while accepting the invitation to go to *the Conference refused to stop fighting.
*-   10The Prime Minister stated that the General Staffhad concerned themselves with political questions and notwith military matters.    What the Cabinet particularlyrequired was a military opinion about a tail it a ry situation,as disclosed,  for example,  in the following factsKoiahak had been defeated and Cufa had been lost,  as wellas Samara, before Prinkipo vas suggested3  and, according toM. Seavenius,  General DenekirMs troops &quot;3r.e of no use.Pie had only 10&apos;., 000 fighting men,  and the  Cossacks couldnever be persuaded to 1 eave their own count ry.    ?hos e weremilitary facts which he hoped the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff would consider as a purely military proposi-ticn.    He agreed that we could not send large numbers of menfrom England,    Kolchak had made a great mistake in hiscoup, d&apos;etat,  and lost his support in consequence by dis-gusting moderate opinion.    That was all left out in thesituaticn put forward in the General Staff Paperv but ifpolitical situations were brought in at all they must becomplete.   Again,  in the case of the Ukraine, while Denekinand his colleagues said that the Ukraine must not be severedfrom Russia, on the other hand the only live movement inthe Ukraine was the Nationalist Separatist, movement.    Thatwas a consideration the War Office must take into accountif they were to attempt to assess the political as &quot;-ell asthe military factors.    With regard to the second policy ofsupplying equipment, he had a perfectly open mind.,  providedhe could&apos;be assured it &apos;;-ould be of the slightest use.Mr Churchill remarked that the basis of the militaryPaper must be political,  because the General Staff werenot merely setting down on paper the forces which we-e atcur disposal.    We were not  dealing with, facts which wereat ail certain.    We were&apos; endeavouring to animate the wave r-ing minds of the Russian forces, which were all that wecould rely on.    The  Russian marftl -depended upon the Allieshaving a decided policy and carrying it out energetically.-5-
Lord Guraon remarked that, the &apos;Var Cabinet were tohave been supplied with a definite programme frou theGeneral Staff for each of the areas of war in Russia.He asked how far each was going to be a fighting area,--&quot;hat support would be required and given, and its effecton the general situation;    to what extent we were goingto supply Denekin with tanks, aeroplanes,   etc-.;    by whatmeans we were going to send them1,   .how they were going tobe paid for, and. whether we would be asked to supply money.r&apos; Recording to a telegram received thatmorning,  Krasnoff had been defeated and had decided toevacuate the whole of the Don provinces.    He would liketo know what we were going to do at Omsk, where there werea number of British troops in a precarious p*sitiMV,  andwhether the War Office were going to leave them there.He would also like to draw attention to the Japaneseattitude.    Japan will leave Eastern Siberia and appear inWestern Siberia if we disappear;    she will take over thecampaign, and she had already made a definite offer tosend 30,000 men.    He read a telegram from Sir FrancisElliot,  dated February 4,  1919 (Foreign Office IIo. 144,Vladivostok),  in which it was stated that, according toAdmiral Kolchak, the Japanese had offered to send an armyto Western Siberia which would crush the  Bolsheviks in twomonths - in exchange for which they asked, for theNorthern half of Sagahhon,  part of Kamchatka and controlof the Manchurian railway.Mr Bonar Law suggested that that was a proposal toforce the Americans to come in,Mr Churchill said that he would have a Paper pre-pared on the lines the Cabinet required.    He would ask theGeneral Staff to say what was the maximum to be attained,,within the limits described upon the basis that wedeclared war on the Bolsheviks by a united declaration
in Paris,    Unless we assumed a whole-hearted effort* wi*thjjb*-the limits described, none of the Russian forces couldbe counted on as effective forces in the scheme.     ThePaper would indicate the possibilities in the varioustheatres of ^ar, at Archangel, Murmansk, the Ukraine, andEsthonia, together with the prospects of General Denekin.They would also consider the question of the CaucasianRailway, which was of particular importance in view of ournaval control of the Caspian.    They would also discussthe question &apos;C.f the approaches to British India, with anappreciation of the situation at ilerv, where GeneralMalleson&apos;s force was situated.   Proa the British point ofview this last campaign was of more direct interest thanthat in other parts of Russia, and was necessarily con-nested with the conditions existing on the Caspian andBlack Sea,    Ke drew particular attention to the conditionof Omsk, and referred to the 5,000 miles of the Trans-Siberian Railway, which had been opened with extraordinaryswiftness last summer by the Czechs.    That Railway was atpresent held in a very loose condition by the ill-organisedforces of Admiral Kolchak, a handful of British troopsand Czechs.    In view of these facts he was of opinionthat it was possible to&apos; ward off the Bolsheviks withcomparatively small forces in that area better than anywhereelse in the world.    He would make a plain proposition tothe United States, that if they were not prepared to comein and do their sha^e they should have no right to stopthe Omsk Government fro;:, coming to terms with the Japanese,If the Russians could come to terms with, the Japanese tosend a few effective divisions to strike at the Bolsheviks,he could not see that British interests were affected.Ke suggested that we should send a few thousand Britishvolunteers so that we wers properly represented, and let -the Japanese carry on.The Prime Minister said that he hoped the GeneralStaff would note that according to LI. Soavenius the UkraineArmy had never existed except on naper.    Dene kin already-7-
appeared to be approaching a crisis;    an advance had? 6Ven J, Jmade on Novooher Kask,  and it was quite possible that thecondition of Denekin&apos;s array was such that it would be in-possible to come to a decision in time to be of any use.He hoped the War Office would also consider without biasthe occupation of the Caucasus by the Italians.    Theyshould consider it  solely from a military point of view.The Italians were apparently ready to undertake the work,and were, no doubt, attracted by the possibilities of pro-viding themselves with the supply of fuel from the Caucasusoilfields.    It would be necessary to know the cost, thePaper must be worked out in detail, and it must be remem-bered that France would be the only other country thatwould join in sharing the expense.Mr Montagu asked whether it was possible to under-take to go whole-heartedly to the assistance of theRussians within a limit.    The whole scheme was based onthe admission that we should declare war on the Bolsheviks.Supposing,  after we had supplied the Russians with materialand a limited number of troops, and they were unsuccessful,what limit could we place upon the reinforcements we shouldhave to send?    Would it not prove necessary to  send con-scripts to support the volunteers? Was it possible to carryon any kind of warfare within limits?    He would like to puttwo questions:-(i) Supposing that volunteers sent by theBritish Government met with sisaster,would it be possible to allow Britishvolunteers to be wiped out by the Bol-sheviks; and, if not,&apos;must not- they besupported by further volunteers o&quot; byconscripts?(ii)  If the volunteers were taken for Russia,would they not have to be replaced inthe Army of Occupation in Germany by con-scripts ?&apos; Mr Churchill remarked that he would tell the  Russiansplainly the limits within which they should expect assistanceand if they did not like our terms they could reject them.It was necessary to have a policy to place boldly before
the nation, and it was imperative to declare that no man-should be sent by compulsion to Russia.Mi&quot; Long observed that we were already committed tothe enterprise;    we were in a bad position from which wecould not escape.    Re asked whether a policy of evacuationwas not  impossible, in view of the Prime Minister&apos;s speechin the house of Commons on the previous day, that therethe v.-orldwould be no peace in   &amp;kR &apos; xuhtil the Allied nations hadcombined to establish order and government in Russia.Mr Chamberlain said that it was possible to say toAdmiral Kolchak and his Government that we would not sendtroops fro.::) our Armies, but that we would give him financialand material assistance,  and we would give him volunteers,but it was no good undertaking that unless the War Officethought that there was a reasonable chance of success.Mr Churchill said that there would be no difficultyin finding the necessary volunteers.Admiral Premantle said that the policy Mr Chamberlainmentioned had been actually tried in Esthonia and Latvia.The Admiral in Command was told to confine his assistance-to the supply of arms and Maval support.    In -7sthonia thepolicy had been successful.    In Latvia at first little hadbeen effected, and the Admiral had not felt justified inserving out arms until quite recently, but he desired topoint out that the limits of our policy had been verydefinitely laid down.The Prime Minister  said that in regard to Esthoniahe considered that there -&apos;ould be complete agreement amongstthe Powers.    The League of Nations would have no chanceunless they were prepared to defend the small nations,.    Onthe whole question he was not in the least  clear that theRussian people  did not want  something in the nature of Eo.1-shevism.    It was true they were tired of if in petrorrad,but  in other districts  it was not the case.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that hecould not smbmit a Paper based on such nebulous material.
He could not, say what Poland would do&apos;,1   nobody could.He could say that,  if the Powers were willing,  theycould send General Haller1 s force there,., but what thosetroops would do against the Bolsheviks he could not say.As against the opinion of 11. Scavenius* that Krasnoff andDehekin were of no use,  General Poole held an entirelydifferent opinion.    If a message were sent out tomorrowthat the Prinkipo proposal had been abandoned and thatthe Allies would allow the Russians to exterminate theBolsheviks, he could not say -hat effect that would haveon General Penekin, General Krasnoff and their colleagues.The Prime Minister had said that, according to IS.. Scavonius,it would have no effect unless supported by troops.General Poole would take a contrary view.The Prime Minister pointed out that  if the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff were prepared to say thatthe whole matter was of so uncertain a character thatno-one knew what might happen, that in itself was a veryserious factor in the problem.    Human nature in Russia wasJust the same as anywhere else.    The peasants had acquiredthe land, and they were very much afraid that it would betaken away from them.    Mr Keeling, who had just returnedfrom Russia, and whom he had interviewed on the previousday,  said that while in Petrograd the workmen w?re sick ofthe Bolsheviks, elsewhere outside the peasants were stillafraid that when the present regime ended the land, wouldbe taken away from them.-   Mr Churchill said that if the Allies would, send outa message of defiance to the Bolsheviks and would statein terms what material support they were prepared to Riveto the anti-Bolsheviks, he thought that  on that basis theGeneral Staff would be prepared&apos; to say whether there was areasonable prospect of success.    It seemed to him to be  achoice between a forlorn hope,  in that case,   and a certaindisaster,  if no such steps were taken.-10-
General Poole said that he had left Gen. Denikin&apos;s army on Jan, 24th. In his opinion Gen. Denikin was not a great soldier nor a good administrator, but he was thoroughly patriotic and enjoyed the respect of everybody.

General Dragomiroff who is serving under him was a first-class soldier.

In regard to the suggestion as to whether the Cossacks would fight outside their own borders, he pointed out that both the Kuban Cossacks and the Don Cossacks were already fighting outside their own territory.

In reference to the question as to how far the Russian staff hoped to extend their operations, he pointed out that Gen. Krasnoff was actually keeping back his young soldiers in order to train them for a campaign on Moscow. Gen. Krasnoff was retiring now owing to a slight reverse. Lord Curzon referred to a telegram to the effect that Gen. Krasnoff had completely collapsed, and had decided to evacuate the Don county.

In reference to report which the Prime Minister had had from Mr. Scavanius and General Franchat D&apos;Espery, both of whom said that Russian troops would not really fight unless they were supported by allied troops. General Poole agreed that the Russians must have allied troops behind them. On the other hand he thought that if we were to send 150,000 troops the only result would be to replace 150,000 Russian troops who would withdraw


If the Russians were left alone, there was nothing they would prefer better than to sit down and see the British fight for them. In his opinion, if we sent mechanics, tanks and aeroplanes, that would be quite enough.

Personally he would not suggest anything more, though this equipment should be provided with British personnel. He did not think there would be the slightest fear of that personnel being captured by the Bolsheviks. At times the Russians fight extraordinarily well. Some of the exploits of Gen. Alexoff&apos;s volunteer army were amongst the best efforts of the war. The Cossacks were well disciplined, well trained and well led.

Lord Curzon asked what the Cossacks were going to do. He would like to know the maximum that General Denikin would do if he were provided with the equipment and material it was proposed to send them. Up to the present he had done nothing. Was he going to expand his operations?

General Poole said that hitherto General Denikin had been fighting hard against the Bolsheviks by whom he was hard pressed, but unquestionably he would go in for the big undertaking. He was fighting a Bolshevik group successfully until he had to support General Krasnoff.  Krasnoff&apos; debacle was merely a question of nerves. There was no other reason to account for his defeat. While General Denikin and General Krasnoff were holding their own, it was essential that Admiral Kolchak should co-operate. Every single Russian would be wanted, and there must be complete co-ordination. If we supplied the guns we had promised, that would be quite enough. The Bolsheviks had never been very serious fighters. The element of surprise was everything in a campaign against them. The impression the Bolshevik gave him was that he was a man who wanted to live a long time. The Bolsheviks had a number of very good officers amongst


th*m belonging to the oil army, they had been obliged to Joi:either because th*ir wives and families had been captured orthey themselves wer&quot; in danger of starvation if they did notHe had been informed by Count Wammgol that there had beengreat deterioration in the Bolshevist ranks.    That was alsoundoubtedly true of the othor side.      The whole of Russiawas tired.      He  could not  speak as to the effect of thePrinkipc Beclaraiion,  as he had left Russia before it wasissued.      With regard to Admiral Kolchak, the position whichled to the poup^j^ej^at; was the same as existed in nearly eve:,othor part of Russia.    A Social Revolutionary Government wasset up which relied in the long run upon the support of extiwsocialists, and any attempt by the Moderates to restore adisciplined form of Government immediately aroused suspicionand was stamped as reactionary.      In suoh conditions it wasalmost impossible to form an army.    From that point of view hthought the coup,.diktat was justified.      He had alwaysimpressed upon the Omsk Government that they must: publish aprogramme to let the Russian people know what they werefighting for.      He was convinced that until the land, questionwas settled in Russia there would never be peace.Mr.  Chamberlain suggested that the Allies might attacpolitical conditions to their offer of military helpp-   forexe.mplef  a definite statement of land policy.The Prime Minister said that it was not only necessarto publish it,  but that it must be brought to the notice ofthe peasants,      86 per cent,  of the population were peasants;th?and many of them illiterate,  and they were/people thatmattered.      He felt that the Russian Generals upon whomwe were relying had no really popular movement behind then.
General Poole said that in their own districts that was not so. The whole question hinged upon the land, and the Cossacks, who were peasant proprietors, were strongly in support of the Russian General.

The P.M. said that while that might be true, the moment one passed out of Cossack territory to the rest of Russia where the system of peasant proprietorship did not exist the case was entirely different.

Mr. Chamberlain draw attention to a telegram from Mr Bagge, H.M. Consul at Odessa (F.C. Mo. 20, Odessa, of Jan 16. 1919), outlining a policy of substantial economic support by the Allies to the districts in the occupation of Allied and anti-Bolshevist troops.

The P.M. remarked that it would be necessary to know the cost of the proposals contained in the telegram, which involved amongst other things, a guaranteeing of the rouble in those areas, and would probably involve a vast expenditure of money. What he really wanted to know was whether, after fighting a whole year, it would be possible for the Allies to make any impression against the solid power of the Bolsheviks.

 Mr. Churchill observed that, taking a far-sighted view Russia as a military force was no longer of any account as a counterpoise to Germany. In certain circumstances she might be of assistance to Germany. As soon as the British and American Armies ceased to exist on the Western Front there would be Germany, including German Austria with an 80,000,000 population opposed to a France with a 40,000,000 population. With 400,000 German males coming up for military service every year as against 200,000 French, it was absolutely certain that, with the present balance of power, in five or six years&apos; time


Germany would be at leaot twice as big and powerful asFrance in man-power.      It appeared as if the Social RepuT^dO&quot;of Germany would model itself on the lines of the Thif,dRepublic in France.     He did not expect an immediate appealto arms by the Gormans,  but the future was. full of menace.In his vif;w the Germans wor* going to say that they wouldnot sign any mor*. documents or agre* to anything further.  Inaddition to this. Russia would prove a great prize toGermany,      If no proper Government in R\.issia were broughtinto existence, Russia would automatically fall a pr-^y toGermany,  and could be claimed by Germany as the prize shehad wen in the War.      Germany had only to sit tight and therewas an immense area open for her forces.    The Russiansituation must be judged as a part of the great quarrelwith Germany,  and unless we were able to go to the support ofthe Russians there was a possibility of a great combinationfrom Yokohama to Cologne in hostility to France, Britain andAmerica.    He regarded a friendly Government  in Russia and astrong Poland as the two essentials.Lord Curzon desired to emphasize the importance ofJapan.      The Japanese were willing to go to the assistanceof the Omsk Government on terms,     We hhould take advantageof the Japanese military assistance if they were prepared -to give it.The Prime Minister said that unfortunately we werenot in agreement with President Wii&quot;on in that, matter. Japanoriginally refused to send troops unless President Wilsonagreed to the policy of intervention,  they were afraid ofPresident Wilson and would not q,gree to a course which hoopposed.The War Cabinet decided that   :-The C,I.G.S. should prepare a Paperon the lines laid down by the PrimeMinist er2 Whitehall Gardens,  S,w\l.13th February, 1919. &apos;
