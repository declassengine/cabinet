(This Document la.the Property, of Kla......Britannic?Jaiesty* a government.)DRAFT MI  JUTES of a Meeting held at 10, Downing street, S.&apos;s..Of. MONDAY,  JULY Si,   1919,  at 12 tfcon.5he President of the Board of Trade informed the Cabinet ofthe position as to the miners * strike,    be said that the whole ofthe Yorkshire miners were out, which meant some 200,000 men.   Theminers in South $ales and Mohmouth were cojainr. out that day.    Onedisturbing feature in the Yorkshire situation was that the localUnion had given orders that the men operating the pumps shouldee.-i.se work.    At 85 mines,  pumping had already stopped.   At 56wins a the pumping *&apos;as being carried on by officials.   At 51 ofthe mines, the fact that the pumps had. stopped was not likely toruin the mines,  but three of the pits had already been floodedand it would take months to get them into working order again.He had received a message that morning to the effect that theattitude of the men was distinctly hostile, and they were endsav-ouring by all means in their power to stop the pumping at the pitsat which it was being carried on.    The Board of Trade had already,issued the following, instructions(a) That the export of coal should be out down to aminimum, with the exception of coal for bunkering:(b) That perishable foodstuffs should have first priorityon the railways, and. coal second priority:(c) Thai the Hallway Companies, agents and Local Author-ities should stock as much coal as possible.Arrangements had also been made with the Admiralty for 500 stokersto be sentAto Yorkshire to assist in pumping operations.   250 of
these had left by special train on the previous morning, and afurther 350 were leaving that day.    The ^ar Office had arrangedfor the protect ion of these rjfen, and for motor lorries to be sentto Clipstone Camp, to Bake the troops there -mobile.    One satis-factory feat-are in the situation was that the North Eastern Railway:.;en *ere returning to w.or&amp; that day.    The cause of the Yorkshirexainers coming out was the question of piece rates.    The Kiiners&apos;Pederation at Keswiek had recommended that all districts shouldcontinue working until the Oovernment had. settled this question,but the Yorkshire miners claimed 14.3 per cent piece rates, where-as the Oankey Report had recommended only 10 per cent.   Discretionhad, however, been given that in certain pits the 10 per cent,coulh be increased to ISt, with a right of appeal to the GoalController for further adjustment.    The President of the Boardof Trade added that,sines the strike had commenced, the ownershad remained apathetic, and the managers we re not even troublingto be at the sines.   Their reason for this was that they thoughta big strike mad got to come, and the present was a good opportu-nity of bringing sattevcy&amp;o a head.    With regard to South &quot;Sales,all the grades were out, with the exception of the hewers.    Inthis strike the surface-workers were mainly concerned, who demand-ed shorter hours in order to bring them into line with * he coal-getters, and double pay for Sunday work. :The home Secretary said he thought there was an improvementin too attitude of the owners that morning, and two good men hadalready been sent, down from London to take charge of the situa-tion.    ;dr mot tram, the local Mines Inspector, who was a veryreliable man, was at present in charge.Mr Bonar Law observed that, as this was an unauthorised strike,he t nour ht the miners* Federation should be asked to assist theGovernment. he Minister of labour then read the following resolutionehieh bad been passed by the Minors&apos; Federation on Wednesday last;-
-*ls 136&quot;Thai this Conference decides that the taaximuuifigure to be accepted in any given districtfor the reduction of one hour per workingshift is to be id.3 per cent., with a propor-tdonate increase for every fractional partof an hour reduction, provided that such in-crease in rates shall not mean an increasein actual wages.   This Conference instructsthe Executive Committee to acquaint theGovernment with this decision, and to obtainan interview with the object of a settlementon the above basis.    In the meanwhile alldiet riots are requested to continue workinguntil instructed to the contrary&quot;.He agreed with fir Bonar law that the attention of the Miners&apos;Federation should be drawn by the Government, to the presentstrikes, and &quot;that they should be asked what action they proposedto take, in view of the fact that the pumps had been stopped,which vrn,R contrary to their resolution.   The Federation mightialso be told that the Government felt compelled to send men f rensthe Fleet to Yorkshire immediately, in order to save the mineswherever possible.   If the Federation was not consulted^ MeSmillle would say that the stokers were sent without asking hishelp, and that if his advice had been asked he might have, beenable to settle the matter.Some discussion then took place with regard to the 10 percent, award by the Gankey Commission to the piece-workers *The Prime Minister said that there was evidently some doubtabout the justice of this award, and on the previous Saturday hehad aeon Lord Gainsford, who had said that 18f per cent. was theright figure, but that  certain owners were in favour of the 14.3per cent.The Minister of Labour observed that, according to his information, nearly all the&apos;owners, with the exception of. a few in WestYorkshire, were against the 14,3 oar cent.The Prime Minister, continuing, said that this was a mostimportant point, and there ounhi to be no doubt about it.   Thepresent strike was practical, and not theoretical Bolshevism, andmust be dealt with with a firm hand.    He was rather inclinedto agree that the mine-owners were right, and that a fight had
got to 0Oi,-.e;   but if the $over ma ant e?iose the present moment theymust be certain that they were on firm ground and had publicopinion behind t-iem.    lie would like to see the owners and. asoer-tain their opinion.    In his view this was a duty, especially asthe Government was meeting the miners&apos; representatives during the .week.    Pome of the owners might think that the present disputewas a bad one on which to take a stand, and - if they wrote to thepapers saying that 14.5 per cent, was a Just demand, it wouldweaken the Governments position.    It would be moslylmwise torush into this trouble without helm absolutely sure.   The wholeof the future of the country sight be at stake, and if the Gov-ernmeni were beaten and.the miners won, it would result in Sovietgovernment.   A fiimilnr ait.uad.ion might result to that of thefirst daya of the Hovolution in Russia, and, although Parliamentmlrrht remain, tbe real Parliament would be at the headquarters ofthe Miners&apos; Federation in Russell Square.   There must be nodivision in the public mind, arid no 30 ri of doubt that the Gov-ernmeni wars not in. the right.    If, after the Government had de-elded to take a stand, two or three newspapers said that theGovernment ought to give in on certain points, then the Govern-sent would! be beaten.    If a fight was to come, it must, bs certainbeyond a doubt that the miners were in tho wrong.The Minister of labour said that orjma facie the Governmentcould not have a better ground than the present ono on which tofights   The &quot;Daily v*ews&quot; and the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; had alreadycondemned the miners for refusing far bonar Law * s offer in regardto t lie d/- rise in the price of coal. -The President of the Board of Trade said that as the HomeOffice, the Ministry of Labour and. the Board of Trade&apos; were allconcerned in a dispute of this kind, he thought it would be anadvantage if one Minister were place^ in charge of the wholesituation.Tho Prisae Minister agreed to this suggestion, and thought that
tne Minister of Labour would be the most suitable to take overthe direction of affairs.The Cabinet then discussed protection measures necessary forthose carrying on the essential work at tne mines.The Home Secretary said that 3,500 won from tne itfavy would,in fir Pic hard Hodmayne&apos; s opinion,&apos;be suf fioient to keep the pumpsin the Yorkshire mines going, a It lie ugh the local estimate shad bean3,000.    Of this number, as had already been stated, 350 had leftyesterday morning, and a further 250 were going that day.   Heunderstood that the Admiralty had difficulty in finding stokersv, r hi e ng.i ne n ten.The First  Lord cf the Admiralty said that the fleet was aboutto proceed, to the home forts for the purpose of giving the menleave, but this oi?d.r could, of course, be cancelled, althoughthe purposes for wbioh they were required would have to be ex-plained to the men.    He would add. that the First Pea Lord had seenthe sailors who left for Yorkshire yesterday morning, and foundtheir opinion ^as strongly against the miners.The First &apos;fe.v Lord fear-ad thai- the whole of the 3,500 menrequired could not - be provided without demobilising the fleet.There waa, however, a certain number of stokers who, by Cabinetinstruct ion,  had beeh reserved for manning the London electricityrabrke, should they be repaired.    If the Cabinet now thought, how-ever, that these men would be more usefully employed in Yorkshire,oncers&quot; could be Issued for them to proceed there.The Prime Minister said that he thought this should be done.The Chancellor of the Exchequer remarked that be was certainthe Admiralty -and the ^ar -Office would do everything in-theirpower&quot; to provide any assistance required, but he thought everyeffort should be made to obtain men local1?.    If the workmen ofYorkshire could assist in working the pumps, for instance, it wouldshow the miners that public opinion was against them.    On a pre-vious occasion when the public had Helped to stoke the furnacesduring a g-?,3 strike, it had had a tremendous effect on the men-5-
out on strike.The Prisae Minister agreed, and thought that Yorkshire shouldaa&amp;e every effort to protect Itself, and. the County should heinformed of the effect it would have on their future if the effortof the rainsrs succeeded.    They should be appealed to to defendthe selves against Solsheviej-a.    If a number of a delaines wereruined, industry would cease and Yorkshire would he reduced tothe status of an agricultural country.The Geerotary of Piate for Tar observed that the brigade atClipstone Gang? had, been placed on a mobilised footing. He wouldadd that the Shine Amy wan still cosplete, and he could bring hosefour Divisions (two insadlately), if necessary,   Marshal Fooh hadintimated that he could spare -these two Divisions.    In hi3 opinion,however,   the tiais had not arrived for this wove, and the Thine Armyshould onl;; be regarded, as a&apos; reserve.   There wore 16 mobile columnsin this country at the present taosient, and these might be suffl-eient to deal with the present situation.    He would take the fullrespoo?ibility for having enough troops to support the civilauthorities, and would s&amp;ake such dispositions as we re necessaryfro-ts time to time.    It tsight oe as well, however,-if he were givenauthority to draw on the Arisy of the [Shine, as might be necessary.The President of the Boa-d of Trade said that he thoughtsomeone should be appointed to organise the internal transport ofthe whole country, should the present situation develop into a bigfight.   Transport was the Key to the position, and the rationingof the country depended on it.   Then tho Industrial Unrest Goisraii-tee had been going into the whole question on the previous day,they had ooaie to the conclusion that, of all the arrangements asade,trans port was the least satisfactory,.The Crisis Minister said that be thought a raesiber of the Govern-sient should be cent down to Yorkshire to organise the local .forces.It would be a great advantage if the 0.0.0., Northern Uosuaand, hadon the spot a Cabinet Sinister with whoa hs could confer.   Therewould be no question of the Cabinet Minister giving orders to the
troops, but the closest co-operation would be maintained.     Hesuggested the name of Sir 15 ric decides for this purpose.Mr. Barnes said that the Government must win on the Yorkshireissue, end be thought they should use all the forces available. for this purpose.     Mr. Smillie and Mr. Robert Williams had beenspoiling for a fight for the last two or three yeers, and in hieopinion the Government would go a long way before finding morefavourable ground on which to challenge them.At this point the Minister of Labour read out to the Cabinet.a draft, telegram which it was proposed to send to the Miners *Federation, asking what action the Federation proposed to taketo deal with the -present situation.After a short discussion, the following telegram was approved&quot;The Government directs your attention to theresolution of the Miners1 Conference onThursday, 17th July, instructing the men con-nected with the mines to remain at work, pend-ing a meeting between the Government and theMiners1 Fxeoutive regarding piece rates.     Inthis connection the Government are anxious toknow what action the Federation proposes totake regarding the calling out by the YorkshireDistrict Council of the Pumpmen in the YorkshireCoalfield, owing to which many Yorkshire minesare at present being flooded.      I need not pointout to you the disastrous consequences of thisaction.      It involves&apos;the ruin of the mines -many of them permanently - and will have theresult of destroying the means of livelihood,not only of the miners themselves, but also ofall those in the Yorkshire District who aredependent on the coal industry.      In view ofthese grave consequences, the Government feltcompelled, yesterday to send men from the Fleetto give aid in working the pumps, but thesewould be withdrawn as soon as the Federationcan induce the regular workmen to return toduty.     As this is a matter of great urgencyI am instructed to ask for an immediate reply&quot;.Sir Frio Geddas said that, if it was decided that he shouldgo to Yorkshire, he would require to take a, certain staff with him,and he would like,  in addition, the Home Office, the Ministry ofLabour, the Goal Controller, and. the Railway Executive, tonominate officials to take with him, whom he could consult.     Hewould also like to have someone to take charge of publicity.The First Lord of the Admiralty suggested Mr. MaieoIra Fraserin this connection, which suggestion was accepted.
Sir Krie Geddes said that it weald aleo be an advantage^ ifthe Postteaster-General eould give orders for any requirements he(Sir Rrio) might have regarding telephones to be met immediately.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would like toraise a question of detail.   The President of the Board of Tradehad stated that coal was being sent into Yorkshire.    He doubtedwhether keeping Yorkshire industries (which wore- normally dependenton Yorkshire coal) going by us in?, imported coal was a wise course.He thought the full effect of the strike should be felt by theYorkshire industries.The President of the Board of Trade said that the result of theClosing down of the Yorkshire mines would be a lose of -500,000tens pe- week.    There was very little coal in Yorkshire at themoment, and, in fact, Leeds had only four days&apos; supply.    If ageneral strike took place, coal would be wanted in this county.Yorkshire also presented a most difficult food problem, and onthese considerations he had thought It best to replenish theirstocks from outside sources.The War Cabinet decided  (a) That the Minister of labour, on behalf of thePrime Minister, should send to the Miners? Fed-era t ion the communication piloted in the aboveMinutes:(b) That the Minister of Labour should assume generalcharge of the strike situation, on behalf of theGovernment, assisted by the Industrial Unrest Cora-mi ttee, which Gozataittee included the Home Seers-tary, the President of the Board of Trade, theSecretary for foot land, and representatives ofother Departments:(c) That the Minister of Labour should summon therepresentatives of the coal-owners to meet thePrime Minister and discuss the situation inregard to the demand for 14.3 per cent.increaseon piece rates, on which subject the Leader ofthe House of Commons had already undertaken tosee the officials of the Miners&apos; Federation:(d) To meet the iamsediate emergency, the Board ofAdmiralty should have authority to divert to theYorkshire coalfields the men hitherto reservedto deal with the strike of electricians in London:(e) In the meantime, efforts should be initiated by theperson designated to he in local charge of arrange-ments to obtain local volunteers to supplement andveplace Nava1 ratings:
(f) Sir Brio Geddee should be asked to proceed toYorkshire to take charge of the strike situation,o.n. behalf of the Government :    he should be aecom-panted by a staff of officials designated by theHome Secretary, the Minister of labour, thePresident of the boar&quot;! of Trade (i.e., rep resent a-tives of the Coal Controller arid the  dailvray Kxe-outive), t ogetm- r with iir iialoola Praser, whowould be in charge of publicity:    in addition, aliaison officer between the general   Jfficer Goa-manding, Northern Gonjroand, and Sir Eric Geddes,should be designated by the Arsiy Council:(g) That the Postmaster-Genera! should be requestedto instruct the local authorities to comply withSir Brie Geddes&apos; requirements as regards tele-phones:(h) That the Minister of La hour should arrange for aQuestion in Parliament to be addressed to triePri e Minister that afternoon regarding the sitaa-t ion.Whitehall Gardens, d.&apos;.i.,July PI,  1919.
