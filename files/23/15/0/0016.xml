iDVAHCE COPX,WAR CABIHET.500.A.MINUTES of_a_M.eeting held on 16 June. 1919 at IP^HOOH*89SITUA- (1) Lord Curzon explained that, at a Meeting of the WarON INSIA.       Cabinet held on June 11 (War Cabinet 578 A.), the Secretaryof State for War had put forward proposals for an advance byour North Russian detachments which had already been -jon-^id-er-ed and approved by the Prime Minister, and after a discussionthe War Gabinet had concurred in these proposals.   Almostimmediately afterwards, telegrams had been received recordingthe serious setback which had been suffered by Admiral Kolchak,and subsequent telegrams received from that area since thenwere far from reassuring.    He was so much disturbed at thepossibility of our undertaking a venture which would proveunsuccessful that he had written to the Secretary of State forWar enquiring whether these reverses to Admiral Kolchak&apos;s armyin any way affected the plans that had been made.   Mr Churchillhad replied that he recognised the gravity of the situation inwhich we were now placed, and he had promised that, beforeorders owere given for an advance by General Ironside&apos;s troops,the Cabinet would have an opportunity to review their formerdecision in the light of subsequent events.    He had spoken tothe Chancellor of the Exchequer and. the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies,, and they had both agreed that it was d.esir-able for the Cabinet to re-consider this question.    He feltthat,before the actual order for advance was given, the Cabinetshould go into the matter carefully once more.The Secretary of State for War read out a telegramwhich had been despatched to General Ironside by the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff, emphasizing the Prime Minister&apos;swishes that under no circumstances were the British troops tobecome so embroiled in the South as to necessitate a reliefcolumn being sent out from England, as no such troops couldor would be sent;    and, secondly, the absolute necessity ofensuring that the operations were so timed as to allow for theBritish forces being embarked and safely got away from Arch-angel before the ice set in.    Mr Churchill pointed out that
the position at Archangel was not wholly dependent on theoperations of General Gaida.    The proposed advance of theArchangel forces was a part of the plan for withdrawing ourtroops from that district.    The military experts believed thatthe real trouble on the Kolchak front was now coming to an end,as the distances the enemy had moved from their base wouldbegin to operate against them.    He must confess, however, thatthe position was not quite a happy one.    On the other hand, thesuccess of General Denekin in the South was remarkable.    He hadgained considerably more ground than Admiral Kolchak had lost,and was being; joined by the forces of a large insurrectionarymovement headed by the General of the 8th Bolshevist Army.   Hehad taken SO,000 prisoners, a number of guns,  and considerablebooty.    The military authorities thought that he could notprogress much further without attracting to his front Bolshe-vist troops which were now operating against Admiral Kolehak;and,  if this happened, the situation as regards the latter wouldbe considerably relieved.    By the date of our operations it waspossible that the situation would have improved.    In any case,he had no doubt that the -military experts would be able to makea case for our advance,  even though the plan of joining handswith Admiral Kolchak was no longer feasible.    He was preparedto promise the Tar Cabinet that, before our troops moved, theywould have an opportunity of reviewing the situation and ofrevising their former decision.    The Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff would be coming over from Prance on the follow-ing Thursday, and would be able to give them his views on thematt e r.Mr Bonar Law stated that when the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff had gone into this question with the Prime Ministerand himself in Paris,  the  only doubt  in his own mind was as towhether there was any great advantage in the plan if the-2-
possibility of joining up with Admiral Kolchak were to be ruledout.    General Wilson had told him at that time that he was press-ing Admiral Kolchak, through General Knox, to give up his plansfor an advance on Moscow, and to consentrate all his energieson effecting a junction with the Archangel troops.Lord Curzon said it was true that General Denekin had wonconsiderable victories in South Russia.    On the other hand, thereverses suffered by Admiral Kolchak were very severe.    A tele-gram received on the previous day stated that Admiral Kolchakhad been defeated by forces which were numerically inferior tohis own, and inferior by at least 10,000 men.    He (Lord Gurzon)was in favour of a forward policy, but he was not prepared togive his assent to a proposition that might launch our men on anexpedition into Central Russia which was doomed to failure.    Hewas afraid that Admiral Kolchak would still be 100 or 200 milesremoved from us,  and our troops might be driven to evacuate theterritory we had covered, with the  additional stigma of failure.He did not wish our plans to be so far advanced that ourCommander-in-Ohief in North Russia could say that his prepara-tions for an advance were all ready, that he was not dependenton Admiral Kolchak, and that he was going forward on his ownaccount.    Lord Curzon added that he had no desire to depart fromthe policy which had been decided upon by the War Cabinet, buthe feared that this policy had much less chance of reaching asuccessful issue than it had a fortnight previously.The Director of Military Operations said it had always beenthe view of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff that,  inorder to make a safe evacuation of Archangel, it was first neces-sary for us to strike an effective blow on that front, and thatwas the main object of the attack proposed by General Ironside.It would be so much the better if, as a result  of our attack,we formed a junction with Admiral Kolchak.    In any case, whetherthe latter was possible or not, our attack could only have the
effect of improving the situation and facilitating our withdrawal,and we should be able to leave the North Russian Government in aposition which would enable it effectively to protect its ter-fcitory.   There appeared to be every reason, both military andpolitical,  for carrying out the attack.Mr Bonar Law repeated his statement that,when the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff had spoken to the Prime Ministerand himself on the matter, the impression left on their mindswas that the operation should not be undertaken unless therewas a possibility of joining up with Admiral Kolchak.The Secretary of State for War suggested that he shouldallow all preparations for the operation to go forward, but that,before orders were given for an actual advance to be made, theWar Cabinet should review the situation in the light of the posi-tion at that time.The Chancellor of the Exchequer enquired whether that wouldbe sufficient.    The situation caused him grave concern.    GeneralIronside had been informed that his proposed operations wereapproved by the War Cabinet, and he was making all preparationsfor going on with them.    He (Mr Chamberlain) thought that somewarning should be given to General Ironside that the defeat ofAdmiral Kolchak had altered the situation and might mean a re-consideration of the plan of operations.   Would it not be pre-ferable to do this now,  rather than leave General Ironsidewithout any warning that the Government might go back on theirdecision, and suddenly at the eleventh hour veto his plans?If it was absolutely necessary for a safe withdrawal that ourforces should gx first advance, he would offer no objection;but when it became a question of prestige, that was a politicalconsideration, and in his opinion our prestige would gain in nodegree by advancing into Central Russia and then immediatelywithdrawing our troops.
The Director&quot; of Military Operations pointed out that theadvance would not be undertaken by British troops alone.General Ironside had S3,000 Russians who would co-operate withus, who would help in the advance and do their share of thefighting,  and who would be left in the occupied territory whenwe retired.The Secretary of State for Tar said he was prepared togive the Tar Cabinet a guarantee that the operations would bestopped in a fortnight&apos;s time before a man had been moved, xnxif the War Cabinet desired it, after further consideration ofthe situation.The Director of Military Operations, replying to Mr BonarLaw as to the advisability of obtaining General Ironside&apos;sviews,  explained that the Tar Office had already done so, andGeneral Ironside had expressed the opinion that the capture ofKotlas would be invaluable from the point of view of futureoperations, particularly having regard to our coming evacuationLord Curzon referred to a telegram from Mr Hodgson, atOmsk, describing the situation on Admiral Kolchak&apos;s front,which, he said, gave a blacker view of the situation than eventhe military telegrams.    In this telegram (No.534, of June 11)it was stated that the situation on that front was still bad,the Western Army still largely in a demoralised state, and thatfailure on the front had caused the latent discontent againstGeneral Headquarters at Omsk to break out.    Certain changes inthe Commands had been made,  and,while they should be beneficialit would be some time before the army, which had been seriouslyshaken by recent events, would be able to renew the offensive.Lord Curzon added that the telegram also stated that Ufa wasbeing bombarded by the Bolsheviks, and he understood that thelatter had since captured the town.The Secretary of State for War said that he had read atelegram on the previous day from General Janin, in which it
was pointed out that a great many of the reserves of the NorthernSiberian Army had been thrown in to defend the Western front ofthat Army, and,  consequently, these reserves had been dissipated.On the other hand, the distances between the Northern and theWestern fronts were considerable.    In the region in whichoperations were now taking place, the Bolshevist thrust hadturned up towards the Perm area, which was at least 200 milesfrom Admiral Kolchak&apos;s right wing.    Consequently he did not atall exclude the possibility of Admiral Kolchak being able toco-operate with our troops at Archangel, but,  of course, theCabinet must know what the situation was before they gave finalorders for an advance.    If it became certain that AdmiralKolchak would be unable to give any help, an entirely newsituation would be created, which the War Cabinet would haveto review;    and it would then be for the military authorities tojustify that advance from the point of view of our successfulevacuation of the Archangel district .Lord Ourzon suggested that General Ironside should beinformed that the situation would have to be reviewed in the.light of the latest information that the War Cabinet had con-cerning Admiral Kolchak.Mr Bonar Law enquired whether it would upset GeneralIronside&apos;s plans if he were informed that the War Cabinet hadapproved of his venture in the hope that he would be able toeffect a junction with Admiral Kolchak, and, since the latterpossibility seemed now to be so far removed, the whole positionwould have to be reviewed by the War Cabinet once more.The Director of Military Operations said he did not thinkit would upset General Ironside&apos;s plans, as he was alreadyauthorised to make all preparations for the advance.    It would,however, be rather unsettling to him not to know whether theadvance would actually be made.
o      o      *      *      e      o      o3, Whitehall Gardens,  S.W,1.,June 18, 1919.The War Cabinet decided -To discuss this matter again on June 27,&apos;in thelight of the situation on the various fronts onthat date, and to ask the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff to be present on that occasionsIn the meantime, while General Ironside shouldgo forward with his plans for the operations aspreviously agreed upon by the War Cabinet, heshould not undertake a definite advance untilthe War Cabinet had finally decided upon thecourse of action.
