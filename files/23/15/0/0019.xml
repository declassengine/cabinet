? NAVAL ? IN THE ?

(1) With reference to War Cabinet 585 B., Minute 2, the War Cabinet had under consideration two Memoranda by the Admiraity in regard to the situation in the Baltic (Papers G.T. - 7513 and 7578). It was stated in the Memorandum that, in the event of the Peace Terms being signed, the Admiralty considered that the situation in the Baltic should he reviewed.

The reason for the presence of British Naval forces in the Baltic was to safeguard the flanks of our friends, but if the Germans succeeded in occupying these provinces the flanks would not be existent, and the question would arise whether, in such circumstances, our forces should be withdrawn from the Baltic or remain there.  It appeared, at first, probable that the Germans only aimed at control of the Southern States, but with the arrival of increased forces it looked as if an attempt was to be made to overthrow the Esthonian Government.

If this should be achieved, the Germans would control the whole country from East Prussia to Petrograd, and it was unnecessary to point out the serious consequences of the far-reaching effects which would ensue should this come to pass. The Admiralty desired to point out, however, that Naval forces were powerless to prevent this, and they would therefore welcome a decision that it is the desire of His Majesty&apos;s Government that the Bolshevik naval forces should be suppressed. These latter forces had repeatedly endeavoured to attack Esthonia, and had opened fire on His Majesty&apos;s Ships. To sum up, the Admiralty recommended:-

(i) That the Peace should not be ratified until the Germans were out of the Baltic Provinces;

(ii) The blockade of Petrograd should he maintained until it was in the possession of our friends:

(iii) The supply of munitions and equipment should be re-doub1ed and hastened:

(iv) The Navy should be given a clear lead as to the intentions of His Majesty&apos;s Government.


The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he had oiroulat-ed the above y,eraeranda in consequence of various discussionsthat the Admiralty had had with other Government Departments&apos;,^ore especially with the Foreign Office.   All that our- &apos;Ploetin those waters was doing at present was to protest theflanks of our own troops and our anti-3olshe vist Allies inNorth Huesla.    Uncertainty, however, as to the policy ofHis Majesty*s Government, placed our Paval Gpmtsanders in adifficult position, and eoae definite instrustions by theWar Cabinet were sought.The Secretary of State for far said that politics in horthRussia were very auoh mixed up with the military aspect ofthe situation.   As regards Tetrograd, trie Jar Office were   *taking no responsibility at all in reapect of the projectof capturing the town.   Pe had, indeed, jjiven a few guns anda certain amount of asaaunition to the horth Russian Corps,but that was all.    Pits Corps had developed very considerablyin the last two months, its nuubers being swollen by capturesand by desertions of the bolsheviks.   Unfortunately, a shipwhich was carrying some of our guns and ammunition for the &apos;use of this Corps had. sprung a leak, and the consequent delay$sight Pave serious results.The Acting Secretary of Pi ate for Foreign Affairs said thatit appeared from recent telegrams that the situation of theCorps was very precarious.The Secretary of State for War, in reply to a question,said that the Corps had been raised simply to fight the Bol-sheviks.    On the other side of the Gulf there was a forceunder General Yudeniich, who had been authorised a short tiiaeback by Admiral Kolchak to endeavour to persuade GeneralMarm-srheitn to come across fro,.:. Finland to&apos; his support.   Therehad been a great deal of haggling and delay about the Batter,
and it was only during the last few days that Kolchak had at last definitely instructed Yudenitch to make terms with the Finns. In the meantime, however, a new Government had been established in Finland, and Mannerheim&apos;s wings had been clipped; and the Finnish Government and Mannerheim were now requesting us to ask them to march into Russia and to give them guns and money, as it was evident that they would require stronger backing than that which Admiral Kolchak could give. Mr Churchill said that he had wired to General Gough that we could not, in any circumstances, take the responsibility of initiating this project of getting the Finns into Russia, which was an enterprise of a highly speculative character. Our diffidence in this matter might be adversely criticised, but undoubtedly it was the wisest policy. The menace to Petrograd certainly had the effect of drawing away considerable numbers of Bolshevist troops from the South.

Kolchak&apos;s delay in coming to terms with the Finns, and the new domestic situation in Finland, rendered the capture of Petrograd unlikley. The War Office hoped, first, that the War Cabinet would sanction our continuing to send arms and munitions to the North Russian Corps, and, second, that the Fleet should be instructed to remain and guard our flanks.

The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he thought that the Secretary of State for War had correctly described the situation in North Russia. He did not think, however, that Mr Churchill had laid sufficient stress upon the precariousness of General Mannerheim&apos;s position. It seemed likley that the Finnish Government might again change ahy day, and that General Mannerheim himself might be superseded. The difficulty in regard to General Yudenitch was that he was an admitted reactionary, and our support of him and his possibly successful appearance at Petrograd would certainly distress the Esthonians. Lord Curson asked, in the event of the capture of the city by


the various forces closing upon Petrograd, who would be in supreme command? Would the control be in the hands of the Esthonians, the Finns, or whom? The situation was chaotic, and it behoved his Majesty&apos;s Government to proceed cautiously. A telegram had been sent the previous day, from Paris, to General Mannerheim, encouraging him to proceed, but stating that it was impossible for us to participate.

The Director of Military Operations, in reply to a question by the Prime Minister, said that the situation in regard to the Germans was rather obscure. It was, however, generally believed to have improved. The Germans had evacuated Libau, and were now some seven miles outside it. In Libau itself there were about 1,500 Lettish troops. The intention was to remove the Germans as soon as possible from the neighbourhood of Libau and to repatriate them by sea. An interesting fact was that these Germans had recently suffered a rather severe defeat at the hands of the Esthonians.

The Secretary of State for War thought that even if General Mannerheim, General Yudenitch and other Commanders with their troops, including a certain number of efficient German forces, should arrive at Petrograd, no great harm would be done. Our own opportunity would then arrive. We should have control of foodstuffs, and consequently could direct affairs. It would be for us to appoint a good Governor of the City, who would be acceptable to Admiral Kolchak, and then politely inform the Germans and the Finns that there was no longer any need for them to remain. Petrograd was a purely Russian capital, and should be left for the Russians. The Finns, indeed, had never laid any claim to the city.

The Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff said that the Naval position differed somewhat materially fron the military.

Our present Fleet in those waters consisted of 6 Light Cruisers


&quot;3&quot; 12310 Destroyers, 5 Submarines, with a few Ksinor weasels;   andit waa intended to send out a ship with seaplanes.   TheBolshevist Fleet included two Battleships.   These had onseveral ooeasiona eosie out of port and shown that they wereable to maintain a well-disciplined and sustained fire.   TheAdmiralty did not desire to have a big Fleet in the Baltic,but it did ward., to receive definite in struct lone from Hie&amp;5a.1esty1 a Government as to whether, in the event of theBolshevist fleet coming out, our ships were authorised toengage them.    Our tactics would be, to retire and draw theenemy fleet on, and. leave it to our Destroyers and Submarinesto deal with it.    Both the Admiralty and the Haval of fleerson the spot were really in ignorance aa to the exact position:were we,&quot; or were we not, at- war with the Bolsheviks?The Pri;ae Minister said that actually wo were at war withthe Bolsheviks, but we had decided not to make war.    In otherwords, we did not intend to put great armies into Puseis- tofight the Bolshevist forces.The First Sea lord asaed that the ?ar Cabinet would givethe Admiralty authority to take any action they might thinknecessary to meet a change in the situation in Berth Russia.As the Deputy Chief of the &apos; aval Staff had said, they did notintend to send, out Digger forces, but our officers there wereanxious to be permitted to engage the Bolshevist fleet if theywere attacked.   In reply- to a question by Lord Guraon, AdmiralWejsyea said that, so far as Be understood the situation, weno longer maintained a blockade in those waters.The First hord of the Admiralty informed the Cabinet thatcur&apos; Fleet was protecting itself by laying mine a across theBay.The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thoughtthat, in respect of our policy in Russia, Hia Majesty&apos;sGovernment must proceed with caution, as there was a strong
element in the House of Commons which was opposed to intervention.

The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he did not quite agree with Lord Curzon. On the last occasion when the matter had been raised by Commander Wedgewood, the latter had received very little support. Supposing the Bolshevist fleet came out, could our ships engage them at once, or would we have to let them shoot first?

The Prime Minister said that when the question of our policy in Russia had been raised at a meeting of the "Big Three", President Wilson had expressed the opinion that there was no legal state of war because there had been no definite declaration of war. A similar state of affairs had existed between Great Britain and Spain in years gone by.

Mr Bonar Law said, with reference to the question asked by the First Lord of the Admiralty, that it was impossible to say, in a Naval engagement, who started the fight.

The War Cabinet decided that --

(a) In fact, a state of war did exist as between Great Britain and the Bolshevist Government of Russia:

(b) In consequence of (a), our Naval forces in Russian waters should be authorised to engage enemy forces by land and sea, when necessary.

SITUTATION SOUTH RUSSIA.

(2) The Secretary of State for War, at the invitation of the Prime Minister, briefly described the most recent developments in the military situation in South Russia. Mr Churchill said that events there were swaying rapidly to and fro. In the extreme South, General Denekin had, some two months ago, three or four good Divisions, with excellent Cavalry, packed in an area North of the Black Sea, which gave them plenty of room to manoeuvre. The opposing Bolshevist forces attacked him and were defeated, but General Denekin broke through and


 took a large number of prisoners. He then marched on to Tzaritsin and Astrakhen, and was shortly joined by a number of Cossacks who had recently rebelled against the Bolsheviks. A feature of the operations in that theatre was the success of some Tanks in the direction of Kharkoff, where they had occasioned widespread terror. In consequence, Denekin had captured Kharkoff and Ekaterinodar, completely cutting off the Crimea, which had been rapidly evacuated by the Bolsheviks who not long since had driven the French there into the sea. In the great area between Kieff and Odessa there were large bands of anti-Bolshevist banditti, under Gregorieff, a man of most unsavory reputation. These bands had invested Odessa, and would shortly be in possession of that town, and also of Kherson. As a result of his successes, Denekin&apos;s power of moving Westward would be greatly increased. We should then have all the ports on the Black See free of Bolshevist control, and it was essential that we should re-establish our trade with those ports with the least possible delay. The English at present were the only foreign nation who were trusted and respected, and the sooner we laid out our trading claims the better. On this subject Mr Churchill said that he was in constant consultation with the Board of Trade. On the 30th Ultime, Denekin had captured Tzaritsin and taken a great number of prisoners, and he expected shortly to be in possession of Astrakhan. He had already reached the railway junction North of that place, and was threatening the enemy&apos;s lines of communications, which were also being menaced by the Ural and Crenburg Cossacks. These Cossacks were based on Gureiey, on the Caspian Sea. We hoped that shortly the existing gap between Zaratoff and Astrakhan would be closed up. When the most important stretch of the River Volga would pass into friendly hands. General Denekin had taken hundreds of guns and large numbers of prisoners, and 3,000 locomotives. General Briggs, who had been the Head of the British Military Mission there, and was


 now in London, declared that the stories about Denekin&apos;s atrocities were without foundation, and that Denekin was a man of high character, who conducted warfare on humane lines. Mr Churchill said that the growth of the Volunteer Army was really remarkable. A year ago it had only numbered about 4,000 men, and today it totalled 600,000 including nearly 50,000 sabres and bayonets. As regards Admiral Kolchak, the latter&apos;s front, which extended from Orenburg to Perm, had been advanced much further than had been intended. Kolchak&apos;s recent defeats were due to the fact that he had been unduly rash in pressing his advance, and that all his troops were put in the front line, and unlike Denekin&apos;s forces, were not trained to manoeuvre: Kolchak&apos;s army was now on the retreat, and had lost Perm; but in Mr Churchill&apos;s view there was no reason why the 160,000 fighting men which formed that army should cease to be a considerable factor in that area.

The Director of Military Operations stated that Lenin and Trotsy were said to be at present near Perm. The Bolshevist operations there were evidently intended to stop a possible junction of Kolchak with other anti-Bolshevist forces in the North. According to the latest information the Bolshevist Government was rapidly collecting troops from every quarter to stop Denekin&apos;s advance. If this were true, it would mean that the pressure on Kolchak must be diminished. It would take the Bolsheviks some weeks to develop anything in the nature of a counter-offensive against Benekin. The latter&apos;s ultimate object was Moscow, but it was to be hoped that his ambition to get there would not lead him, like Kolchak, to be too venturesome. In reply to a question, General Radcliffe said that the climate would permit operations to continue until the end of November. He thought that both the opposing forces were probably very short of ammunition. Another factor in the situation was the anxiety of the Bolsheviks to keep the Turkestan Railway open.

  


The Prime Minister said it appeared that, rinse- theCabinet had decided to sanction General Ironside&apos;a projectin the Perth, the situation had altered considerably, owingto the rather severe defeat of Admiral Xclchak.The Secretary of state for War said that, when the matterbad been diseaseed in the previous week by the h? Cabinet,the Chief of the Imperial General Staff had explained thatit was impossible for as to effect the safe withdrawal of ourtroops unless we struck an offensive blow first towardsKotlas,    This olow weuld be quite independent of the proposedjunction with General Gaida.The Prime Minister said that,  whatever happened,  theCcvernment must strictly fulfil their pledge to Parliamentand the country that our troops in forth sussia would bewithdrawn before the ice set in.    He hoped the Secretary ofSlate for &apos;%r fully realised the importance of our troopsno\ getting inextricably involved.T\e Secretary of State for &apos;&quot;ar said that our plans includedevery feasible precaution to avoid this.The first Sea lord said, in regard to the withdrawal ofour troops froxi the Caucasus, that he hoped that the Navalforces operating in the Caspian Sea would not be left  &quot;in theair&quot;.    They would, of course, render all possible assistanceto General Denekin in his operations towards Astrakhan.The far Cabinet took note of the statementsby the Secretary of State for Tar and theDirector of Military Operations.fhitshall Gardens^  s W 1duly 4,  1919.
