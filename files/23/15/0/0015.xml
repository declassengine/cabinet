Lord Curson said that he had summoned the  Cabinet thatevening at the request of the Secretary of State for War, whohad just returned with the  Chief of the Imperial General Stafffrom Paris.    Our Commander in Worth Russia proposed to conductcertain operations in North Russia at an early date, with a viewto relieving the situation there.    He understood that the planof these operations had been submitted to the Prime Minister inParis, and that the latter had accorded them his sanction,  sub-ject to their receiving the approval of the War Cabinet.The Secretary of State for War explained that GeneralIronside,  commanding in North Russia, had now completed his planswhich the Chief of the Imperial General Staff would presentlyoutline to the War Cabinet.    These plans had been carefullyexamined by the General Staff,  in concert with the Admiralty,and had been approved.    On the previous day the Chief of theImperial General Staff had put them before the Prime Ministerand Mr Bonar Law, who had provisionally sanctioned them, subjectto the Cabinet?s approval.    In the ordinary course it would nothave been necessary for him to refer the matter to the PrimeMinister and the Cabinet;    it was, however, desirable in thiscase, as for the first time we proposed to depart from ourpresent defensive policy and embark upon definite aggressiveaction against the Bolsheviks.The Chid! of thelmperial General Staff then read to -theWar Cabinet telegram No.78771,  dated June 10,  1919, to GeneralKnox, summarising General Ironside&apos;s intentions,  and he explainedthe situation with the aid of a map.    General Ironside proposedto advance with one British and one Russian Brigade againstKotlas, which he expected to be able to take within fifteen daysfrom the commencement of the operation.    Simultaneously,  aRussian force would move down the Valogda railway to Plesetskaya.Should it appear feasible to effect a junction with GeneralGaida after the capture of Kotlas, General Ironside intended to
take part of his force thirty miles South of Kotlas to blockthe Shohena, while another portion of his command would clearthe Wichegda area and. get into touch with, the right flank of theSiberians.    Should it not appear practicable to join up withGaida, his intention was to hold Kotlas as long as possible andto- clear the Wichegda area, sending all craft down the river toArchangel, thus denying Kotlas to the Bolsheviks as a base beforethe winter,,    His preparations would be sufficiently advancedto enable him to commence operations in two or three weeks&apos; time,but before advancing he stipulated that Admiral Kolchak shouldkeep his right  flank where it was at present,  near Glasovo.While General Ironside was advancing towards Kotlas, AdmiralKolchak would co-operate by moving in the direction of Vietka.If once these two could join hinds,  our communications would beassured and General Ironside would be able once more to basehimself on Archangel.    The moral of our two Brigades, which werecomposed of picked men only, was excellent, and the Slovak troopswho would be taking part in the operations were also in verygood heart.The Secretary of State for &quot;Jar observed that the plan ofoperations precluded, any possibility of General Ironside &apos;stroops being cut off.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff,  continuing, saidthat the worst that could happen would be  (a) that the enemywould not face us and that we should merely strike a blow inthe air;    and (b) that Gaida should fail to make headway fromthe South and link up with us.    In any case it could always beopen to us to withdraw.    Unfortunately, the enemy had only toevaporate in order to spoil the coup.    Our object was twofold;(i) to hit the enemy hard, and (ii) to  join up with the friendlyforces in the South.    If once we could establish connection, wewould hand over control of the operations to Admiral Kolchak,and proceed ourselves to withdraw from North Russia. The wholeintention of these operations was to facilitate that withdrawal.
If,however, we attempted to clear out without striking a Plowfirst and establishing touch with the troops in the South, wewould have the whole pack of Bolsheviks at our heels and wouldbe risking a possible disaster.   As the Secretary of State forWar had said,  our troops ran no danger of being cut off.    GeneralIronside had been ordered, whatever happened, to effect the with-drawal of our troops from Forth Russia before the winter.    Inreply to a question, General Wilson said that the port closedin October or November, according as winter set in early or late.The First  Sea Lord, said that arrangements had been madefor our Naval forces in that theatre to co-operate in the contem-plated. operations.   As, however, they would have to advance alongthe river in boats, they would have to proceed cautiously owingto mines,  and might take longer than fifteen d.ays to reach theirobjective.    The Naval ratings who would take part in the expedi-tion were not conscripts, but ordinary long-service men, andabsolutely to be trusted.    Our Naval policy in Forth Russia wassimply to support the Army.    Unfortunately,  our Monitors wouldnot form part  of the Naval force, which would consist of 10 gun-boats and, 6 mot or- boat s .   We were,  in addition, sending, a numberof barges and heavy guns.    In reply to a question, Admiral Wemysssaid that the third week in October was the latest safe datefor our men to clear out of North Russia.The Secretary of State for India stated that Parliamenthad. been informed, that all the troops we had sent and were sendingto Forth Russia were despatched with the sole purpose of enablingus to withdraw in safety the men we already had there.    Was thismove a part of that operation?Lord Gurzon also enquired whether the projected expedi-tion was inconsistent with any pledges that we had given in eitherHouse,    The contemplated operations presented a new situation.This was the first time that we were taking the offensive againstthe Bolsheviks.
The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that the mentaKing part in these operations were not &quot;driven conscripts&quot;,but were, on the contrary, tremendously keen about the wholeexpedition^    In reply to a question, he said that Admiral Kolchakhad known all along that we intended, to carry out some suchoperations as those now contemplated, but this was the firsttime that they had been put forward in any detailed form. AdmiralKolchak&apos;s own forward movement would be all right if he securedcommand of the river.    We were maintaining a powerful Kissionwith Admiral Kolchak, who was fully aware that, whatever happenedand whatever pressure he might exert later, we did not intendto remain in North Russia another winter. The area in whichthe operations were to take p3a- ce could supply us with amplefood,  especially if we managed to link up with the South.The Secretary of State for Tar,  in reply to Lord Ourzonand the Secretary of State for India.,  said that,  in a recentspeech in the house of Commons, he had fully explained ourpolicy.    That speech had met with a very satisfactory reception.He himself did not think that there was anything in the opera-tions now projected which was inconsistent,  or could not easily   -be reconciled, with what he had stated in parliament. He foresawno difficulty in justifying to Parliament the present plans,which were simply designed, tc secure our withdrawal from North-Russia, more especially if,  as he saw no reason to doubt, theywere sucoessful.    The repatriation of the Ozecho-Slovaks wouldbe much facilitated by the proposed operations,    They would betold that it was up to them to fight their way home throughKotlas,  etc., before the coming November.    He thought that, asthey professed a great contempt for the Bolsheviks, they mighthe induced to make the effort.    General Denekin had gained, aweek or two back, a great victory over the 10th Bolshevik Army,who had been.repulsed with heavy losses, no less than 15,000orisoners being taken.    General Denekin was now advancing with
powerful forces.    If he oould take Astrakhan and Tzaritzin,he could consolidate his position and dominate the Caspian.Mr Churchill said that the recognition of Admiral Kolchak wouldbe considerably to our advantage, as by this action we mightinduce both the Americans and the Japanese to play a largerpart in that theatre of war.The Tar Cabinet decided&apos;  To approve the proposed operations.tehall G-ardens,  3.7.1.,June IS,  1919.
