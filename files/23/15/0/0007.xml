-ATTON The war Cabinet had before them an Admiralty Memorandumimp10 AND       on the necessity for a policy in the Baltic Provinces *vPaperH Ruh^I     g..rjh-6969), and Memoranda dated March 14, 1919, circulatedby the Secretary of state for War, dealing with (a) thesituation in North Russia, and (b) the situation in theBaltic Provinces  (18/J/44).lord Curaon said that if was useless for the War Cabinetto take piecemeal decisions with regard to military, navaland financial assistance to Russia until there was a defi-nite Russian policy.   At present there was no policy.   Apolicy could not be evolved in London:    it must be framedin Paris,    Some two or three weeks ago a division of respon-sibility for assisting certain territories had been proposed,namely,  Poland to Prance, the Baltic to Great Britain, andthe other border States to other Powers.    The First Lordhad come to him and asked if the Wavy could proceed on thebasis of this division.   He (Lord Curzon) had telegraphedto Paris, with very unsatisfactory re suits.    It had beensuggested from Paris that a loan should be made to Esthonia,but this had naturally been resisted by the Treasury.    Itwas necessary to know precisely for what reasons we were,or ought to be, assisting the various Russian elements.   Wew-^re assisting Kolchak in Siberia, General Denekin in theDon country, a so-called Government at Archangel and Mur-mansk, and the Baltic States.   All these were in differentcircumstances and had varying aims.    Denekin and Kolchakwere Imperialists seeking to revive the old Russian regime.Similarly, General Yudenieh was organising Russian forcesin Finland, and General Leven in Lithuania also re pie sentedthe Russian Imperialist Party;    and any assistance given tothem would be used to revive the old. monarchical Russia.They undoubtedly meant to attempt to recover the border States-1-
A further difficulty lay in the fact that, while Eathoniawas now holding its own, the neighbouring St at. es were onlykept from Bolshevism by the aid of German forces.    InLatvia there were 13,000 efficient German troops, which hadbeen transported by sea to Libau,  opposing the Bolsheviks.We were refusing to give them help, and at the same timewere refusing to send our own troops to oppose the Bolshe-viks.    The Secretary of State for War now came forward witha scheme to organise Russian officers and prisoners,  butsuch a scheme was useless until we defined our generalpolicy, and that policy could only be defined in Paris bythe Peace Conference.(At this stage Mft Ohurohill entered.)Mr Churchill stated&apos;that he had circulated the twoMemoranda in response to the desire of the General Staff,but had not put them forward as his policy.    He felt thatthe War Cabinet decision with regard to Murmansk andArchangel, when known, would deal a considerable blow tothe Russian cause generally.   At the same time the Murmansk-Archangel line was so unpromising in a strategic sensethat he did not think it wise to press the Russians tomake special efforts to defend it, as efforts there wouldlead to nothing.    He had just hea,rd from the Chief of theImperial General S taff the result of conversations he hadhad in Paris with our Prime Minister and with MarshalPooh.   Marshal Foch was opposed to encouraging the Russiansto go in at this point, and the Prime Minister similarlyfeared that the policy suggested in the War Office Memo-randa would only lead to costly enterprises like that  inwhich we were participating with General Denekin. GeneralWilson went on to suggest that before sending a Missionto the Baltic it was necessary to wait for a decision onRussian policy from the Supreme War Council;    but whenthat would be obtained he had no idea.
Mr Churchill,  continuing, said that the War Cabinet mustface the fact that the North of Russia would be over-runby Bolsheviks, and many people would be murdered.    He wasincreasingly distressed with the way the situation had       -developed since the Armistice.   Everything was going wrong.The continued disheartening of the Russian forces friendlyto us had led to a great falling off in their moral..    Whenfiring stopped,  the Ukraine was occupied by the Germans.We requested them to withdraw, but we put in no Alliedforce there, and now that area, rich in food, was in thehands of the Bolsheviks.   The Bolsheviks were takingNicholiev and Kherson, and were advancing on the BlackSea.    Odessa might sodn be invested..    Pour months hadpassed in a policy of drift, and great potential resourceswhich might have helped us were being dissipated.    It wasidle to think we should escape by sitting still and doingnothing.    Bolshevism was not sitting still.    It was advanc-ing, and unless the tide were resisted it would roll overSiberia until it reached the Japanese, and perhaps driveDenekin into the mountains, while the border Baltic Stateswould be attacked and submerged.    No doubt when all theresources friendly to us had been scattered, and when Indiawas threatened, the Western Powers would bestir themselvesand would be prepared to put forth ten times the effortthat at an earlier stage would have sufficed to save thesituation.    He could only express the profound apprehensionwith which he awaited what was coming.    He had beenbackwards and forwards to Paris in vain.    He had &amp;is-cussed the situation with Marshal Poch, who had a definiteplan for action without /
the use of British and French forces * or money, but onlyby guaranteeing loans to the smaller States;Both the PrimeMinister and President Wilson were againstThe First ford said that the Admiralty had suggestedthe f orraaiion of a Gommittee,similar to the Eastern Gom-tsittee, which should advise upon the policy for the BalticProvinces * and should review this policy fro;:a time to time.Such a Gottuaittee could at lea at formulate guest ions? for theSupreme ^ar Council * to which the 3af Cabinet could ^e^uesta:, answer.    Possibly in this way definite pressure couldbe put on President Wilson.    lie agreed with the Secretaryof State for vh*r that we were running the risk of gravedisaster4 and we should be confronted with questions inParliament to which it would not be easy to reply.Admiral Prem&amp;ntle urged the need for some oo-ordinatingpolicy. were at present rendering naval and militaryassistance in a thoroughly unsa t is f a a t o ry fashion.   !&quot;e hadlost a valuable Light Cruiser, with eleven lives.    If thebolsheviks increased their concentration on the tSsihenianfront we might lose everything we had put there.   Whilethis expenditure and loss ware being incurred, the treasurywere- refusing to advance loan? to FSstbonia (on the securityof flax, and to Latvia (on the security of timber).   Hethought there should be a Committee co-ordinating ourpolicy in the Baltic Provinces,  and containing representa-tives of the Admiralty, the war Office, the Treasury aridthe Ministry of Pood.Mr Bonar law asked whether such a Committee could saywhat we ought to do to protect the Provinces and alsofurnish, an estimate of the cost.Lord Curzon said that it was not surprising that theTreasury were obdurate on the. question of loans to the-4-
Baltic States.    The representatives of Esthonia and Latviahad each asked for a loan of  15,000,000, which was anabsurdly large sum, and which the Treasury had properlyrefused.    He had a Note in preparation for the War Cabinet,recommending, subject to the policy to be decided on, aloan of S3,000,000 to each State, to be shared between usand the Allies.Mr Bonar Law asked was it not impossible for us to go onundertaking to help one part of Russia after another whileAmerica definitely stood out?The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated, that the UnitedStates would do nothing to help such a policy.    The Frenchborrowed what they were lending /for spending, and the burdenin effect fell on us.    He had just returned from Paris,where the French had asked him to assist them, at a rateequal to our total pre-War expenditure.   The Americans ex-ores sed their disinclination to&apos;do more for France or forus than assist with purchases made in the United States.There was no way out for a ruined Europe unless the UnitedStates would untie her purse-strings.    It was impossiblefor Europe to shoulder these ever-accumulating burdenswithout the assistance of the United States.    On the otherhand, there was something to be said for working out theproblem in London, so that a careful statement coxild besent to Paris to the Prime Minister.    Our naval and raili-tary experts could say definitely what steps might beundertaken, and give some estimate of the cost.Mr Bonar Law said that he saw no objection to a Commit-tee considering the question of protecting these borderStates, but he would be against spending a penny on suchprotection without the participation of President Wilson;because even if we got the French to share, in fact weshould have to pay,Mr Long said that unless some large organised policy-5-
o uwere pursued by the Allies, Russia would, be reduced for along time to anarchy and misery;    and, with such a prospect,how could the Powers sign a Treaty of Peace in Paris?Mr Chamberlain said there was not the slightest chanceof securing financial help from Prance or Italy for under-takings against Russia.    If, therefore, it meant that thewhole burden of resisting Russian Bolshevism was to bethrown on this country, we should break down under thestrain.    That was a very real danger.    He thought it wouldbe useful to learn from the proposed Committee what exactlywas involved in carrying along, Bsthonia and Latvia.    He hadseen no calculation of what would be required in the way ofmilitary, naval and financial assistance.    lie had expressedhis willingness to give them credit to cover the provisionof machinery, but had made it plain that for other assist-anoe they must tufcn to the United states.Lord Curzon said the Pastern Committee had been usefulbecause it had been presided over by a Cabinet Minister-with power to hear Departmental views and to take decisions.What was now needed was to bring pressure on the ParisConference, and he proposed that the Foreign Office shoulddraw up a despatch for submission to the Prime Ministerand our representatives in Peris.    It should deal only withthe Baltic Provinces.    He was willing to draw up the des-pateh, but would like to receive the written views of theWar Office, the Admiralty and the Treasury.Mr Bonar Lav; asked whether it was possible to put downwith any definiteness the probable cost in ship3*. men andmoney.Admiral Fremantle said the answer would depend, xxpon whattroops the Bolsheviks would concentrate in any particularplace.    Esthonia had been able, with the help of Finnishvolunteers, British arms and British ships, to clear theirterritory of Bolsheviks;    but Latvia had been over-run.
We were at present helping Latvia with the moral supportof our ships, and ouri coal,  oil and military supplies werereally now being used to the advantage of the Germans.Mr Churchill said we were really helping the Germans,because in this case the Germans were helping us.    We wereable to control the Germans, but we were not able to controlthe Bolsheviks.to allMr Chamberlain pointed out that Marshal Poch had refused/further reinforcements of Germans to be landed.Mr Churchill said that our representatives at Spa werebeing pressed by the Germans as to what exactly we wantedthem to do.Lord Guraon said he wished to obtain a decision from thePeace Conference.    He doubted whether the appalling eharacteof the situation was fully realised in Paris.Mr Churchill said it was difficult to frame estimateswhen there were so many uncertain counters and factors ofevery degree of variation in the situation.    If, for,in-stance, we decided to wage war on the Bolsheviks, then thestock of Denekin and Kolchak would immediately go up;    sowould that of the Bsthonians and the Letts.    One could notcalculate the cost exactly until the Allies made up theirminds whether they were out for a vigorous campaign or not.Mr Bonar Law said that an effort must be made to disting-uish our activities in the Baltic States from the largerRussian policy.   We had undertaken to support the BalticStates against the menace of Bolshevism.Mr Chamberlain said we had decided that we were notgoing to fight the Bolsheviks all along the line. It wasbeyond the capacity of Prance and Britain to do so, and theUnited States would not co-operate.    That could be madeplain to the General Staff.    They should address themselvesto the question of what was necessary to prevent the Baltic
States from being submerged.Mr Churchill said that the General Staff could onlyproceed on certain hypotheses, and he wished again toimpress the War Cabinet that the danger was growing everymoment and spread/ing with extraordinary rapidity.The War Cabinet decided that  (a) The War Office, the Admiralty, and, ifthey wished to do so, the Treasury,should send Memoranda to the ForeignOffice, dealing with the assistancerequired to protect the Baltic Statesfrom Bolshevism, and the probable costof such assistance;(b) On the basis of these Memoranda, theActing Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should prepare a despatch tothe Prime Minister, ashing for thedirection of the Supreme War Councilas to the policy to be pursued inregard to the Baltic Provinces:(c) In the meantime, no Naval or MilitaryMission should be sent to this area.S, Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.1March 17,  1919 .
