J- 129(This Document is the Property of His BritannicMa .i es tvf s Government.)WAR CABINET -590 A.DRAFT MINUTES of a Meeting held at 10, Downing Street, S.W.,on WEDNESDAY,  JULY 9,  1919, at IS Boon.TUATIOB        With reference to Tar Cabinet 588 A., Minute 2, LordISIA.Curzon said that he was rather perturbed regarding thesituation at Archangel,, as he understood that the advance onKotlas, which had been sanctioned by the Cabinet on June 37,had now been abandoned.    The Cabinet had agreed, to thisadvance, not with the hope of effecting a junction withAdmiral Kolchak, but as an offensive-defensive operationwhich would make easier the evacuation of our troops fromthat part of the world.    His anxiety was increased by thefact that a mutiny had taken place among; the Russian troopson the Dwina, in the suppression of which three Britishofficers had been killed and two wounded.The Secretary of State for War said the development ofthe situation had shown how prudent the Government had beenin not sending alarmist telegrams regarding Admiral Kolchak&apos;sdefeat to General Ironside at a time when he might have beenexpected to make the proposed attack.    The War Office hadnot interfered in any way with General IronsideTs judgment,and he (General Iaonside) had come independently to the con-clusion that the suggested attack would be unwise, at anyrate during the present month.    The War Office had telegraphedto General Ironside informing him that they considered hisdecision a sound one, in the circumstances.
4)130Lord Ourzon said that the whole argument in support ofthe attack had been that it was necessary in order to securethe evacuation of our troops.The Secretary of State for War replied that, of course,as the operation had now been abandoned, it would make theevacuation more difficult, yet he still believed that it wouldbe possible to evacuate on the date named,  and he expectedor beforethat the last remaining British units would leave on,November10, with the exception of the Military Mission.       Withregard to the situation at Perm (War Office telegram Bo.3758), the evacuation had taken place for the followingreas ons:-(a) The river was abnormally low, which ore-vented our flotilla advancing:(b) The moral of the Bolsheviks was better thanhad been anticipated:(c) The Bolshevist artillery was of longerrange than our own.As for the mutiny (reported in War Office telegram E.1533/Ebl,  of July 7), this occurred in a battalion of Bolshevistcriminals which had been raised by a British sergeant calledDyers, who was now dead.    At one period they had foughtexceedingly well, but no doubt the mutiny had been broughtabout by enemy propaganda.The Chancellor of the Exchequer doubted whether, from themilitary point of view, there was any advantage in remainingat Archangel till so late a date as November 10.The Secretary of State for War replied that he feared theywould have to stay until the very last minute, as the enemywas showing unexpected strength,  and they would have to organ-ise the Russian forces before the evacuation could take place.Lord Curzon said that he was anxious about the future, andfeared, in the light of the statement made by the Chief ofthe Imperial Gene    1 Staff, that by abandoning the offensive
4 gjoperation the future night be .seriously compromised.In reply to a question, the Secretary of State for Warstated that it was too soon to say whether or not we shouldhave to bring away with us a number of Russian refugees.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said there was anothermatter connected with the Russian force -on which he was notquite clear.    The Army Council had asked for a special allow-ance of Ss.6d. a day for the South. Russian force, and theArmy Council now asked that this allowance should be givento the North Russian force, in order to attract volunteers.The Secretary of State for War explained that the con-scripts in the North Russian forces were entitled to leaveby September, and the extra allowance of Ss06d. was asked, foras an inducement to these men to stay on and assist in theevacuation.    It was not contemplated that fresh volunteersshould be obtained from this country and sent to Archangel.He thought it essential that the extra allowance of 3s.3d.should also be paid to the Military Mission, which wouldconsist of some 2,000 men and would have to remain therefor the whole winter.The Chancellor of the Exchequer remarked that he thoughtthat this British Military Mission of S,000 men would be leftin a very precarious position after our other forces had beenevacuated, and he viewed with anxiety the retention of sucha number of British troops.The President of the Board of Education said that hehesitated to intervene in a military debate, but, when thisquestion had come up before, it had been stated that theDwina was the only line of communication to Archangel, and hehad suggested that if this river could be kept mined weshould be able to get our troops away.    The First Sea Lordhad also mentioned that he had good mines for this purpose.He would like to ask why it was not possible to keep theriver mined sufficiently long in order to enable the evacua-tion to take place at an earlier date-3-
The Secretary of State for War said that this was part.ofthe scheme. It was intended that the river should be defen-sively mined.3 ft. 6 in. deep at the present moment nothing could be done.Mr Bonar Law said, that the situation in North Russia mustbe kept under constant review.    The Prime Minister was veryanxious that our pledge to the volunteers should be carriedout.    He thought it would be helpful, however, if the Secre-tary of State for War could obtain from the Chief of theImperial General Staff an appreciation of the new situation.The Secretary of State for War undertook tocirculate an appreciation of the presentsituation on the Archangel front, and. inRussia generally, for the Cabinet&apos;s con-sider-ation at an early date.The First Sea Lord pointed out that as thle river was onlybiteha11Gardens,July 9,  1919.
