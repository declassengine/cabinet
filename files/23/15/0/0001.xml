S EC RET.WAR CABINET 531A.DRAFT MINUTES of a Meeting held at 10 Downing Street,3.w.on &quot;WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 12, 1919,  at 11-30 a.m.THE POOD (1)  With reference to War Cabinet 530, Minute 4 (b),SITUATION.the &quot;Jar Cabinet had before them two Memoranda by the FoodController (Papers J-. T.-6773 and 6783) on the position offood supplies in the event of  the interruption of miningand railway and other transport services..The Food ^ontrolier said that the country wasdivided into eleven areas, and over each area there pre-sided a Food Commissioner, who was responsible for thedistribution of food in his district.      The Ministry ofFood had complete information regarding the stocks heldby tnese Commissioners,  but they had not complete informa-tion regarding the stocks held by the retailers.      Thepolicy of trie Ministry in the past had been to spread itsreserves as widely as.possible,  and the Food HoardingOrder with regard to certain commodities had now beenwithdrawn and it was possible for householders to holdcertain quantities of flour,  etc.The Prime Minister said that  the miners were firmlyconvinced that they could hold up the community and pre-vent the distribution of food, and he was not at all surethat if the miners realised that it was possible for thecommunity to withhold supplies from the miners,  that theywould not adopt a more reasonable attitude.    He wanted toproceed on the principle of keeping reserves in centreswhich could be defended should the necessity arise.Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government).
**** 2   11Sir William Be v:e ridge said it was almost impossible, fwithout  it becoming widely known,  to differentiate between I! pdistribution in the various districts.    Should, the threat- 1IIened strike take  place, howerer,  it would be possible toprevent  immediately food going into certain areas. iiThe Pood Controller said that,    if we announced a    1policy of withholding supplies from certain districts1before a strike took place,  it would rally the whole ofthe Labour movement against the Government.    It was import-ant,  in a matter of this kind,  to  divide those whofavours d co n s t i t at i o nal m etho d s and th e ana.r ch i st s .Mr.Bonar Law agreed that  it would be fatal,  beforethe trouble had broken out,  openly to endeavour torestrict supplies in the mining districts.    Arrangementsmight be made, however,  so far as the Ministry of Poodstocks were concerned, that they should shut off from theaffected areas on the outbreak of a strike.Sir William Beveridge said that it would bepossible to feed the  country if a reasonable amount ofroad transport was available.The Home Secretary said that the Committee onIndustrial Unrest had gone into this question and hadascertained that 200,000 drivers would have to be madeavailable for driving the lorries requisitioned by the RoadTransport Board,  and he was informed that it was doubtfulwhether Army drivers could be used in this connection.The Secretary of State for War said that he wouldnot go so far as to say that Army drivers would not bereliable,  and he would like to give the Cabinet a consider-ed opinion on the subject.    It was all a question of howthey were handled.    A. 11 the reports he had received, as tothe behaviour of the troops in Glasgow indicated a mostsatisfactory state of affairs,  and the men were behavingin a most  exemplary manner.
*m% 3. Sir Norman Hill said that if the distribution offood was held up for three weeks,   this would paralyse thedischarges from the  ships.    The ports at this moment werealready stored to  their utmost capacity and could nothold any more  stocks,   and his information was that nopublic storage was available elsewhere,  except in thebig towns.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that  the bigtowns could store any amount of foodstuffs if publicbuildingsnere utilised.    As he saw the position,   therewere  three questions before the Cabinet  :-(i)  Curtailing of supplies to the raining districts.(ii)  Distribution of  the  retail  stocks in the countrydistricts.(iii)  Concentration of stocks in certain large urbancentres so that if the railways were held upthey could be distributed with an economicaluse of transport.There was no doubt that,   if the food at present  storedin the ports was collected in the big towns,  distributionwould, be easier from these centres than from the ports.The prime Minister said that while he did not wishto take a decision that day he did not want the Cabinet tofeel that the country could stand a strike of the miningand transport services for three months or so withoutgrave discomfort,  and his idea was to prepare for thedistribution of food by filling up the big inland centresand examining the organisation of motor transport.The President of the Foard of Trade said that,   ifanything happened to  the railways,   it was most importantthat the ports should, be cleared immedi ately.The War Cabinet decided that  :-The Shipping Controller should, make arrangementsfor immediately clearing the various ports oftheir food, stocks,  and,   the Minister of Food inconsultation with the Departments concernedshould prepare a plan for the distribution ofthese stocks among various inland centres,   fromwhich,  in the event of a strike,  it would bepossible  to  supply the population.
The Meat (2)    The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by SirSituation.T.B.  Robinson  (Paper G.T.-6781)  in which he suggested thatthe Ministry of Food should increase the civilian meatration and reduce the price of meat.The Minister of Food said that he was in favour ofthis proposal, and had already appointed a Committee to gointo the question of the lowering of prices, but thismight result  in his having to make a heavy call upon theChancellor of the Exchequer.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that hehoped that new food subsidies, like that which had beengiven for wheat, would not be considered.    This was,however, a different question from the Government cuttingIts loss on the existing stocks.    The whole subject, re-quired very close examination.The War Cabinet decided thatThe following Committee should be appointedto examine the question of reducing the highprices of food and increasing the presentcivilian meat ration:-The Food Controllei- (Chairman),A Representative of the Board of Trade,A Representative of the Board of Agriculture,A Representative of the Treasury, andTwo Members of the Consumers&apos; Council.The Committee tc be convened by the Ministryof Food.-4-
