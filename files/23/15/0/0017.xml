^jjD, Trie Far Cabinet had before the.a the following telegram from]the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, dated June 24,  1919 (Paper G.T.-7559) :-&quot;The Irish Government are again face to face witha cruel and brutal murder in cold blood o,f aDistrict Inspector of Constabulary In CountyTipperary.    &quot;his is the county in which recentdastardly murder of police took place.    honeof the murderers have Seen brought  to justicethrough terrorism and intimidation on the partof the Sinn Fein, which undoubtedly committedthese murders.   &quot;Fie Irish Government are nowforced to conclude that Sinn Peiners in thatdistrict are an organised club for murder ofpolice and that time has come when Sinn Feinand its organisation in this district of Tip-peyary must he proclaimed an illegal Asseoia-tion.   Government are in position to make thisdecision effective in this locality and desireapproval of Cabinet to tame immediate steps&quot;.Lord Ourson said that, in view&apos; of the importance of thedecision which the :s*ar Cabinet was asked to take on *his matter,he had communicated the Lord-Lieutenant&apos;a telegram to Paris andhad received the following reply:-&quot;The Prime minister and Mr Bonar Lav have discussedthe telegram sent yesterday by Lord French  regard-ing 4 he murder of the District Inspectjar--o^-Oojr1 at)--ulary in County Tipperary, and have considered thesuggestion of the Irish Government that Sinn Feinand dtp organisations in this part of Tipperaryshould be proclaimed an illegal Association.    ThePrime Sinister and hr Bonar Law assume that thewhole of the Iris&apos;; Government are in favour ofthis course of action, and they are not prepared,to oppose the view of the Irish Government in thismatter so long as the latter think that it is theonly possible way of dealing with the question&quot;.He assumed, although Lord French&apos;s telegram did not definitelysay so, that the whole of the Irish Government *s.s in favour4 oft he c our s e o f action 3 u g ge 3 * e d.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he thought theCabinet was bound to assume this, and in his view the IrishGovernment, should be given a free hand.    Some little time ago he*as in Ireland, ani Lord French re-guested him to attend a Councilat the Viceregal To its.   At this Council the question of 0 roc.1 aim-inn; the Sinn Fein orgasrisation was discussed,  arid. Lord French thenwanted to take action liamedi&amp;teiv, but the Chief Secretary was
O - 98doubtful on the point.    He (Bj? Long) had suggested that, unlessiBHSediate action could be ensured, to proclaim was useless.    Hehad satisfied himself, when in Ireland, that the Police organisa-tion was not effective, and the Irish Government then decided toconduct ari examination into the Crime Section.    He understoodthat this had been donev and the Grime Section improved.    In hisopinion these murders of the Police in cold blood were the worstfeatures that had ever shown themselves in the Irish situation.&apos;?hen in Ireland he had  attended the Gurragh Races with the Lord-Lieutenant, and on their journey to the races they were aoccmpan-ied by a oan in front and a car behind, both filled With dgt.ee-tiyea:    in addition, they sere accompanied by soldiers.    Thiswas a.   impossible stats of affaire and must be put down.The President of the Board of Education asked what wouldbe the practical effect of proclaiming Tlpperary.   He assumed itmeant that everyone in Tipperary would come under the ban.    He wasin favour of any measure that would protect the lives of Constablebut would tie proclaiming of this district have that effect?It might conceivably make it more difficult to compose the Irishtroubles.    Than in Ireland last autumn he had found that Sinn Feinwas a very composite uovement, and it  embraced not only academicvisionaries and advocates of physical force, but many holdingordinary nationalist views.    In certain schools which he hadvisited he had found that the children were being taught violenthatred of England.    Similarly, the priesthood appeared to beunited, in their hostility to this country.    It. was difficult toproclaim a county whose moral forces were enlisted against us.The Home Secretary said that Lord French&apos;s telegram pro-nosed that the Sinn hein organisation should be proclaimed, andhe assumed that this included the proclaiming of the IrishVolunteers, which was the most dangerous organisation in thecountry.    There was no doubt that the Irish Volunteers wareResponsible for these murders,  arid in hi opinion ne-ons would be
relieved more than trie Sinn Feiners If tils Irish Volunteers wereproclaimed.The At tor no y-Oener ai for Ireland than g ave the reasons whyhe thought that Inspector Hunt had been singled out for thismurder,    he was of the opinion that if Sinn Fein was proclaimed inTipperary only it would mean that this organisation would be pre-eluded from holding any meeting in that Comity, but the Countiesadjacent to Tipperary would not be affected.    He thought theExeatsti-^e or Parliament of the Finn Fein organisation should beproclaimed, and perhaps  the Irish Volunteers as well.    The effectof this would be that Sinn Feiuers could he tried before a Gourt-martial and net before two Resident magistrates, as at present.Lord Carson aaid that t ha re was no doubt that the temperof the people was in a most dangerous state,, when murders in opendaylight were committed and the murderers allowed to escape.    Inaddition, at the inquest the Jury declined to give a verdict ofwilful murder, and refused to find the only poastole verdict.In these circumst a:. e e s the Irish Government had made the recommend-ation contained in the Lord-Id. 3  tenant &apos; s telegram,, and the Cabinethad no cause to doubt that the recommendation was unanimous of theIrish Government.    He did not think that it was for the Cabinetto discuss which members (if any) of the Irish Government -hadagreed or disagreed.    Further, it had been suggested that theIrish Volunteers should be proclaimed,  as well as the Finn Feinorganisation,  but if the Cabinet suggested this&apos; course to theLord-Lieutenant it would appear tnat they were going behind therecommendations made to them.   He would have been prepared to dothis, however, had the Prime Minister and he Bonar Law, in Paris,suggested this line, but they had proceeded on the assumptionthat the Irish Government was united, and he thought the CabinetShould do the same-    He would not object, however, to asking. LordFrench, in the telegram which had/to be addressed to him, whetherthe proposed action was unanimously reoommend-d by the Irish
Government.   Lord Curson then suggested that the following tele-fjraas should be despatched to the Lord-Lie at enant t -&quot;Are Irish. Government unanimous?    On that assumptionCabinet are prepared to accept view of Irish Gcv-emment and give the authorisation required. Presumeyou have considered other alternatives, includingproclamation of Irish Volunteers rather than SinnFein&quot;.The        Cabinet approved thepr o p os e d t e 1 e e. ram.Whitehall Gardens, S* &quot;?.l.June 26, 1919.
