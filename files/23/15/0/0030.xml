The Local Authorities shouldclearly understand that the intention was to form a centralfund for the improvement of the mining districts.The Prime Minister said that the fund would form asort of development grant, to be administered by a centralauthority, which would consider any local schemes submittedto it.Paragraphs1 and 2.With reference to paragraphs 1 and S9 the ChancellorThe Minister of Pensions undertook tore-draft paragraphs -1 and 8,in the lightof the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;scriticism.-    SECRET
ragraph 3. Mr Barnes, the Secretary of State for the Coloniesand the Secretary of State for India expressed the opinionthat paragraph 3, as drafted, shut out too definitely thecpossible ultimate adoption of a policy of nationalisation.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that hedid not object in principle to nationalisation, but he agreedthat it was an impossibility to nationalise the mines atpresent,  because the subject had not been adequately exam-ined and there was no well-thought-out scheme available.The Food Controller feared that the paragraph, as itstood, would be construed as a direct challenge by the miners.,and it had tc be borne in mind that the great Trade Unionswho were in favour of constitutional action -were pledged tonationalisation.    It would be regrettable if they were forcedinto the ranks of the direct actionists.The First Lord of the Admiralty and the Minister ofLabour laid emphasis on the danger of driving the capitalistinto a state of despair at a moment when it was essential tostimulate his confidence.The Minister of Labour was in favour of adhering tothe paragraph as it stood.    The Government had either toadopt nationalisation or the policy of the Memorandum.    Lessthan the latter woxild cripple the coal trade irretrievably.The Secretary of State for India urged that the Governmenfs alternative to nationalisation was going to lead, he-feared, to the erection of most powerful combinations whichmight prove too strong for the Government, and ultimatelyforce the Government to nationalise the mines.   Therefore,words should not now be used which would preclude the Govem-ment from nationalisation if forced to it later on.Mr Bonar Law said it was important to convince capita&quot;,ists that the Government were not playing with them, but werdefinitely against nationalisation.   He suggested that thecriticism of the paragraph could be mot by substituting thewords &quot;that a case has not been made out which would justify2-
them in undertaking State purchase&quot; for the words &quot;that* they would not be justified in undertaking&quot;, etc.Thg Minxater of Health, the Borne Secretary and thePresident of the Board of Education said they would, acceptMr Bonar Law&apos;s amendment.The President of the Board of Trade said that it mightbe better to go back to the original draft, and state thatthe Government were opposed to nationalisation on Post Officelines (Paper G,T.-79 4(3)  ).The Prime Minister said that the more moderate Labourleaders were anxious that the Government should not &quot;alam thedoor&quot; upon nationalisation.    They wanted to avoid a strike ondirect action lines,  or doing anything that would throw themoderates into the arms of the extremists.    It was the dutyof the Government to strengthen the moderate elements, andif the present trouble was surmounted, the subject wouldbecome a political question.    If, then, the Labour Partyseoured a political majority in favour of nationalisation,it would be open to them to adopt that policy.    He hoped theCabinet would allow him, in making his speech, to approachthe problem in a way which would strengthen the opposers ofdirect action, while at the same time making quite clear thatthe Government were not prepared to nationalise mines now.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was surethe Cabinet would wish to give the Prime Minister all possi-ble latitude in making his statement, but he himself wishedto emphasize the danger indicated by Sir Robert Home, thatcapital might be paralysed.The Prime Minister stated that the capitalists were avery much smaller body of men than the miners, and it wasmuch easier explaining the Government policy to them.Mr Bonar Law&apos;s amendment was agreed to.raph 4(1). It was agreed, on the suggestion of theChancellor of the Exchequer, to substi-tbte &quot;as.;rapidly as possible&quot; for &quot;withoutdelay&quot; in-paragraph 4(1).
jstsgraph 4(S). The Secretary of State for India suggested that itmight be well to define more closely &quot;a limited period&quot;,  at&apos; the end of paragraph 4(3).It was agreed to add the words  &quot;(say, two years)&quot;.,3graph 4(4). Sir Eric Geddes suggested that paragraph 4(4)  shouldbe amended 30 as to make it clear that the workers could berepresented on the Board of Management.This was agreed to.It was also agreed to omit the words  &quot;andthe status of each representative of theworkers on this body should be in all res-pects equal to that of the other members&apos;&apos;.The Minister of Health suggested that in paragraph 4(4)words should be inserted providing for the representation ofthe consumers on the Board of Management.The Prime Minister said that, in making his speech, hewould deal with the protection of the consumers, and Indicatealternative ways in which it might be secured in the Governmentscheme.Ira graph 4(5). With reference to paragraph 4.(5), Mr Barnes objectedto the arrangement by which groups of capitalists were to beallowed to put up schemes of their own to the Governmentwithout any guiding principles,  such as limitation of profit.The present Memorandum fell short even of Sir Arthur DuckhanMsproposals, and left the initiative to the capitalists.The Prime Minister said the point raised by Mr Barneswas important.    He thought there was much to be said for theGovernment declaring that schemes of amalgamation should besubject to principles laid down by the, Government for theprotection of the public against exploitation,  for example, bythe watering of capital.Sir Eric Geddes said that the principle should heenunciated in general language, and should not have detailedreference to particular abuses,  like the inflation of cap-ital.
;   260The Minister of Labour urged the Cabinet not to takea line now which would make the coal owner feel that he wasgoing to be obstructed in the management of his business..If the coalowner were unsettled, the eounrry would be driventhrough a period of increasing disaster and forced intonationalisation at the end of it.    Rather than such uncer-tainty, he himself would prefer to nationalise the mines rightaway.    The coal trade was in a most embarrassed condition atthe moment, and the Cabinet should confine itself to generalprinciples,  leaving details to be worked out later.The Prime Minister said that, while proper considera-tion must be given to the capitalist, the two other greatinterests       the miners and the consumers   must not beoverlooked.    There was a positive danger of the Government&apos;3policy leading to the establishment of tyrannical Trusts,bolstered up by inflated capital, preying upon the publicafter the manner of the Rockefellers and the Armours.   AnyTrust tolerated by the Government must genuinely seek toincrease the efficiency of the mines and serve the consumereconomically.    He could state,in his speech, that the Cabinetwas definitely against the watering of capital and the conse-quent burdening of the community, as had happened in the csseof the railways.    Nothing could be more dangerous than toconvert the fight for nationalisation into an anti-Trustfight.The Chancellor- of the Exchequer submitted an alterna--tive draft of paragraph 4(5), which was accepted by theCabinet.^ae.raph 4(6). It was agreed to omit paragraph 4(6).aragraph 4(7) It was agreed, in place of paragraph4(7), to insert paragraph 6(2,) of theoriginal draft (Paper G.T.-7924).The Memorandum,as finally agreed to, isreproduced in the Appendix..
fopOSBDtJCY.TRADE     (3)    With reference to War Cabinet 610 A., Minute 1, theWar Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the President ofthe Board of Trade (Paper GMT.-7974). regarding the proposedTrade Policy of the Government.The President of the Board of Trade said that, althoughthe Paper had not been seen by the members of the  Sub-Commit-tee appointed to consider the Trade Policy of the Government,yet the decisions of this Committee were embodied in theMemorandum.The Secretary of State for War observed, that there wasno reference in the Memorandum to the wholesale restrictionof imports, and he was under the impression that this ques-tlon was to be placed in the forefront of the Government1spolicy.    Mr Churchill added that the policy of the Government,as at present outlined, contained three matters which wouldcause the greatest perturbation to Free Traders:-(i) Imperial Preference,(ii) Anti-dumping,(iii) The protection of key industries.The Prime&apos; Minister said that the regulation of allImports would also cause uneasiness to Free Traders .Mr Bonar Law said that he was anxious to know whetherthe new; policy of the Government would be in force as soonas the restrictions on imports were removed.The Prime Minister said he understood that the Presi-dent of the Board of Trade proposed to substitute,immediatelywholesale restrictions were removed, the protection of keyindustries, the anti-dumping proposals, and protectionagainst countries whose exchanges were demoralised.. ../TheBoard of Trade had stated that this policy was based on theground that we had to restore the industries of this country,which had been for five years devoted to war purposes, topeace purposes, and that during the transitional period wedid not want goods fx^os other countries dumped in thiscountry.
The President of the hoard of Trade said that thepolicy followed in all the Papers written by the Board ofTrade on this subject, was,that the restrictions on importsshould be removed.The Secretary of State for -ar said that the Sub-Committee had made a considerable advance on the questionsof licenses and license fee,  and he had been convinced thatit was necessary for the license fee to go to the State.The minister of Pensions express :?d the opinion thatit would not be possible to withdraw import restrictions untilthe anti-dumping legislation was in operation.:     The Prime Minister said that if,  on September 1, itwas found that there was an article in respect of which, theExchange was operating against us,  and which was being soldin this country below the&apos; cost of production here, surelythere would be some restriction on the import of that articlefrom abroad?The President of the hoard of Trade agreed that, arestriction In this case would he necessary.    Be said thatthe restrictions would remain on the product of hey indus-tries, and on September 1 he would &quot;bring in License Dutieson articles which were the product of hey industries.    Headded that there was no real harm in removing all restric-tions for three or four -months, inasmuch as there was a world-shortage of all hinds of goods.The Prime Minister then read an extract from a Reporton the state of trade in Germany, which showed that there waslittle fear of competition from that country;    and he statedthat,although German workmen were applying for work, theywould not accept it when offered.    The Prime Minister addedthat the Go-mans were, complaining they were oroducing nothingand that their -markets we-e being captured by the British.Their manufactures had pone down&apos;to aero,  and the&apos;   could donothing to remedy this until their Parliament act in October.
The President of the Board of Education &quot;-thought itwould be illogical for the Government to pass the Profiteer-&quot;ing Bill and then to restrict imports.The Secretary of State for &apos;7ar said that, with regardto paragraph 3 of the memorandum under discussion, he wasconcerned as to the definition of &quot;key industries&quot;,  andsuggested the following should be substituted for the firstsection of paragraph 3:-Key&apos; industries should be defined as Indus-tries indispensable to  our means of makingwap and maintaining ourselves in time of war,and which were practically non-existent inthis country before the War,  or existent onlyto an extent wholly disproportionate to war-time requirements&quot;.With regard to paragraph IS, relating to the improvedregistration of imports, Mr Barnes stated he doubted whetherthis was worth doing.The President of the Board of Trade replied that,without improved machinery for the registration of imports,it would be impossible to carry out the anti-dumping law. Itwas not the income such a registration would bring in thatthe Board of Trade wanted, but rather a  register which would,show exactly what was coming into the country.The Minister of Health said that he considered thedocument under discussion unsatisfactory.    In the firstplace,  it said nothing about the abandonment of the presentsystem of import restriction.The Prime Minister interposed, saying that he proposedto state, in his speech, that the Government would drop theserestrictions, but that if the dumping of certain goods inthis country affected our trade, the right would be retainedto impose import restrictions on such articles until thenecessary legislation was passed to prevent it.&apos; . -      The Minister of.Health said that, in regard to para-graph IS, relating to improved registration of imports, thisanticipated a big general scheme, on the ground that it --xr,-necessary for anti-dumping.    He thought this proposal would
ae very unpopular and would require a- vast machinery tocarry it out.The opinion waa expressed that it would not henecessary for the Prime Minister to touch on this questionin his speech,  inasmuch&apos; as it was not a question of policy,hut a question of machinery.The Minister of Health differed from this view, andthought that no Government would remain in office for threemonths which endeavoured to carry such a proposal intoeffect.The Prime Minister ashed the President of the Boardof Trade whether he pressed for the inclusion of paragraph 12The President of the Board of Trade replied that,  atthe present moment,  it was impossible to ascertain whatpoods came into this country.    The-information given inreturns,  outside dutiable articles, was worthless.    To putinto operation the proposal for improved registration of im-ports would cost about half a. million sterling a year, andwould require a staff of, perhaps, two thousand.Mr Bonar Law said that at the present moment a returnhad to be made to Customs of every article which came intothis country, but there was no question that such a returnwas inaccurate;    but this was not the fault of the Customs.//The President of the Board of Trade stated that there wasat present no means of obtaining the information required toguard against dumping.The Prime Minister pointed out that any provisionnecessary to make the dumping law effective could be putinto the Anti-Dumping Bill.    Be agreed that there was verylittle in the way of principle involved.in t.his Clause, buthe was afraid that  it would arouse more criticism and oppo-sition than anything else in the policy which he proposedt o e x p 1 a i n to P a rli a me nt.The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested that, apart.-from any other reason,  the provision referred to was worth
while on account of the improvement that might be&quot;expected,to take place in the Customs Returns.    When the importrestrictions policy was initiated, considerable difficultieswere experienced on account of the fact that these returnsdid not provide all the information that was necessary,    Kewas prepared to agree to having this question postponed, buthe honed that  if would not be turned down altogether.The Prime Minister suggested that the Customs Regula-tions under the Customs Acts might be altered and improved.This would only involve laying them on the Table of the Houseof Commons.    If necessary, an increase to the statisticalstaff at the Customs House might be considered.    Or,  one ortwo prosecutions for furnishing false information might beundertaken.    By these means the information required mightbe obtained.*It was agreed that no mention of the suggestedregistration of imports and the proposed foeshould be made in - the Prime Minister&apos;s state-ment;   but that this question should be ad-journed for future coxisideration;    and that,,in the meantime, the President of the Boardof Trade should look into the matter againwith a view to seeing how far improvementscould be effected in the Customs Returnsby amendments to the  Regulations under theCustoms Acts.The Secretary of State for Par drewglttention to Section13, under which it was proposed that power should be givento prohibit the importation of goods,except on license,fromcountries from which exportation to this country was stimu-lated in consequence of the state of the Exchange.    MrChurchill said that the argument of the second paragraphof this Section, which was based on a Note which he had drawnup, did not justify the strong wording of the first paragraph,and he thought that the word &quot;power&quot; therein should be quali-fied by some adjective,  such as  &quot;emergency&quot; or &quot;temporary&quot;.What was wanted at present was not a definite law prohibitingimportation, but power to make Regulations to that end, shouldthe occasion arise when it was considered necessary to do so.Should Germany, on account of the state of the Exchange
I \   $ between the two countries, attempt to - import into the United.Kingdom large volumes of goods, the Government would be jus-tified in saying that while the Exchange was in that stateprohibition on the importation of goods from that  countrywas necessary in order to protect our own industries.    Kedid not think that such a situation would arise.    The valueof an article depended, amongst other things, upon the amountof human effort which was put into its manufacture;    and,  inthe present impoverished condition of Germany,  it was unlikelythat they would be able to provide us with large quantitiesof goods at prices which bore any true relation to the amountof human energy that had been put into them.    The prices ofgoods in Germany were going up already, and in Cologne,as hewhere, ekxtuk had Informed the Cabinet on a previousoccasion, Zeiss instruments were formerly being sold socheaply,-the price of these articles had now increased fourtimes. --;-While the Exchange was so formidable they could notbe expected to cay their debts.    He agreed, however, that1the Prime Minister would be justified in stating that theGovernment would take the powers if it should be necessary.It was agreed that the word &quot;emergency&apos;&apos; shouldbe inserted before the word &quot;power&quot; in thefirst line of this section;    and that the PrimeMinister should draw attention to the factthat the Government did not intend to exercisethis power unless it were deemed essentialto do so..Schedule of The Secretary of State for Tar suggested that the&apos;;-ey Indus-tries. Committee on Trade Policy should be asked to draw up -aschedule of the industries which were to be regarded as keyindustries..    They had not previously had time to considerthis question..The Prime Minister said that,  in making his statement,he did not wish to give a complete list of key industries,but he would like to mention one or two of the least oont.ro-v e as la 1 o f them..It was agreed that the Committee on TradePolicy should be asked to meet again inorder&quot; to draw up a Schedule of Key Indus-tries-.
id?1, Trade. The Minister of Pensions pointed cnif tiiat--t.be MemoTair-dura before tho Cabinet Eade very little reference to o^&apos;&quot;exnort trade.(Tbe Prime Minister stated that he had received aletter from tho First Commissioner of Works, enclosing aletter from Messrs Vicksrs, who complained of interferenceby Government Departdents in contracts which that Companyhad made with foreign countries.    Sir Alfred Mond had alsostated in his letter that he was continually meeting businessmen who complained of Government interference in theirforeign trade at a time when it was so vitally necessary toincrease our exports.The First Commissioner of Works confirmed the state-ment made by the Prime Minister.    Ke was continually beingtold by business men of the discouragement they received fromGovernment Departments.    With regard to the question raisedin the letter from Messrs Pickers,  that they had been pre-vented from supplying aeroplanes to China,  there was no doubtin his mind that other Governments would impose restrictionson their firms in a matt or of that kind.The President of the Board of Trade pointed, out thatno licenses for export trade we re needed,  except in connec-tion with war material and certain foodstuffs under thecontrol of the Ministry of Food.    With regard to manufacturedgoods, there was absolute freedom as regards exports fromthis country, &quot;although there was not freedom of import intoother countries.    Franco,  for example, had imposed seriousrestrictions on the imports from this country of wool andwoollen noods.    Sir Auckland Gaddes added that Messrs Pickershad big plans in connection with exports to Serbia,  Roumaniaand Poland,  which countries they proposed to supply withrailway equipment and agricultural machinery;   but they werenot willing to finance these exports themselves, and, asthere was no-one to pay at the other end, they wished theTreasury to ensure them against risk of loss.
hitehall Gardens,  Sf&quot;.l.,August  14,  1919.(3) The Chancellor of the Exchequer raised the questionof the state of the foreign exchange.    In drawing up theTrade Policy nor before the war Cabinet, the President ofthe hoard of Trade had naturally had his attention concen-trp/ted upon the effect up on - our own trade.    He (Mr Chamber-lain) was concerned particularly with the state of theAmerican Exchange, and there was no doubt that this wouldcontinue to go against us if v-e bought many luxuries fromt he Unit e d ft ate s.The Prime Minister enquired whether he should mentionthe inflation of the currency in his speech,    fas there anyprospect of withdrawing some of the paper money which was atpresent in circulation?The Secretary of State  for the Colonies thought thatit would be better not to mention this subject at present.The Chancellor of the axchequer said that it wouldnot be very easy to beep silence on this question if, what...announcing, the removal of control on trade, the AmericanExchange were at the same time going against us still more-He would say that sudden deflation of the currency was notpossible,and was not desirable sven if it had been possible.The Secretary of State for Tar pointed out that therewas certainly a case for refusing to buy luxuries fromAmerica,  out,at the sane time,  the powers of retaliation ofthat country were overwhelming at present.   We could not sajthat we would take nothing from her except prims necessitiesfor she *ould demand that we should take a representativesection of he- trade.    Otherwise she would insist on takingfrom us nothing but  our high grade goods, and that wouldPit0- tanto reduce cur own purchasing power.It was agreed that this question should-bereferred&quot;to the Cabinet Committee on Finance.
