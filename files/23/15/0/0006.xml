(frhi&amp;Jlp.euragnt- ia the Property of. His DritihritnMaAest&quot;y.a^Goygrnment.) &quot;        -WAR CABINET 541 A.DRAFT MINUTES of a Meeting held at TO, Downing Street, Son TUESDAY, MARCH 4,  1919,  at IS Noon.(1) With reference to far Cabinet 538 A., Minute 1, th*War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by Marshal Poch(Paper ?h.C.P.l 9)  regarding the delimitation of GermanFrontiers, and a Note for Mr Balfour by M. Tardieu on thesubjeot of the Left Bank of the Rhine (Paper W.CP.135).The Prime Minister said that when the subject waalast discussed by the Cabinet it had been decided to adjeumthe discussion until the Acting Secretary of State forForeign Affairs had had time to consider the question.    Heinvited Lord Ouraon to inform the War Cabinet of his viewson the French proposals.The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairssaid that there were two proposals made by the French,The first was the proposal to rectify the boundary ofAlsace-Lorraine by the inclusion of Landau and the SaarValley.    This amounted to a claim by the French to go backto the boundary of 1814, and not.to that of 1870,   Thisclaim could not be defended either on grounds of nationalityor self-determination,    It could only be defended on groundskf strategy or because Prance was entitled to the Saar eoal-fields as compensation for damage done to-or less of othercoal mines during the War.    As regards Landau, Franceclaimed to absorb and own It; in fact, to annex it.   Thatwaa a military question demanding an expert opinion.    Therewere no political or eoonomic reasons for the claim.    Inrespect of the Saas% the only&apos; grounds upon which we could
support the French claim were that it should be regardedin the light of an indemnity and as reparation for damage-sustained.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in thatcase if we agreed to support it it must be courted againsttheir general claim for reparation.The Prime Minister agreed, and said he would put thepoint to hi. Glemenceau on his return to Paris.The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairssaid that the second proposal of the.French was for theformation of a Buffer State on the left bank of the Rhine.In regard to this State, both Marshal Pooh and M,Tardieuhad been studiously vague in their written communicationsand also in their conversations, he understood, with theBritish Delegates at the Peace Congress.    Ehat they saidreally only amounted to this -  &quot;We do not want to annexit, its fate must be decided by the Peace Conference&quot;.I n r e g a r d tot h e mi lit a ry a s p e c t of t he  proposal, Ma r sh a 1Pooh desired the control of the bridgeheads on the Rhine,and evidently envisaged a permanent military occupation.He himself felt that the idea of maintaining a permanentmilitary force on the Phine was intolerable.    So far as thepolitical aspect was concerned, the French disclaimed anydesire to annex, but beyond this gave no indication at allas to what was contemplated by them.    The population of theDuffer State was entirely German.    Kow, thena was it pro-posed to provide for its Government,having regard to theprinciple of self-determination?   Woxild the State be re-garde d as a part of Germany when the terms of peace cameto be settled, and would it be expected to bear its shareof the war indemnity?   Would it be subject&apos;to such tariffrestrictions as the Associated.Powers in Paris might decideto impose upon Germany?    Then, in the future, hew would itbe possible to-prevent such a State moving in the directiondictated by its ethnological  instincts?    In his view there
were only two alternatives]    either it would tend towardsits Trans-Rhenish friends and eventually re-unite with them;or the French would encroach upon it until they finallyabsorbed it.    In the latter case it Would be better forthem to annex it outright.    So far as our own interestswere affected, we were concerned with two things(a) The safety of Europe and the peace of the world:(b) bur individua 1 int erest s .In respect of the latter it would, no doubt, suit us tohave Germany pushed back, to the East bank of the Rhine .On the whole,  it seemed to him that it should be cur policyto do our best for France and to support her claims with aview to diverting the French from, their colonial enterprises.He regarded it as an extraordinary phenomenon that the French,with their greatly diminished population, should yet, whilethey were imploring their Allies to protect them, unfoldthe most anhitious projects all over the world withoutrealising that these ambitions must estrange those who havebeen associated with her in the vVar .    In making the suggest-ion that we should support the French at the Peace Congressiii this matter, he had not overlooked the possibility ofAmerican opposition;    as,  if the President&apos;s principles wereaccepted,  the population of the Buffer State should have aright to self-determination.    U.e would, however,  refer tothe proposal he bad put forward at a previous meeting whenthe matter had been discussed, that in his view it was mostdesirable that an early opportunity should be taken of set-thing our differences with the French in every part of theworld,  e . g ,, Morocco,  certain portions of India,  etc., sothat we should go with them to the Congress,when the delim-itat ion of German frontiers came up for consideration, witha &quot;clean slate&quot;.    He was disposed to think, however, thatthese &quot;/ere not the lines on which our Delegates now in Parishad lately been proceeding. .The Secretary of State for &quot;rar said that he agreedwith the Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thatthe first important step for ua to take was to come to anarrangement with the  French for the safeguarding of ourmutual interests.    $re could then endeavour to persuade Pres-ident Wilson to meet our joint views.    In regard to the pro-posed Buffer State he thought that what ever happened theremust be no question of any&apos;military force being &quot;maintainedin this belt;    and,  further, that there must be a Frenchforce of sufficient size /
to obstruct the passages of the Rhine.     He suggested thatuiarshal Pooh should be asked what permanent occupation of thebridgeheads actually meant in figuresj l*e., what  forces itwould be necessary to keep there *      He might be contemplatingmerely a police control-     He urged the Cabinet not to take anunsympathetic view of the French proposals..      In reply to aquestion by Lord Curzon as to what form of Government the bufferState should have, l.e*, was it to be German, Neutral or aCondominium, Mr. Churchill said that the State in his view shouldbe self-governed and further that it should not be called uponto bear any share of the burden of debt laid on Germany, or inthe payment of the Indemnity.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that MarshalFoch at the Congress v/ould take his stand upon the permanentoccupation of the Rhine with, a military force.     The ,-arshal hadtold him that to guard the line from the old corner of Lorraineto the Dutch frontier would require from lo to 15 Divisions.That line was about 80 miles longer than the line of the Rhine,but from the purely military point of view it formed a strongerfrontier,,      The French felt that they were immensely handicappedby the fact that various neutral states or duchies broke theline of their frontier..      (General V&apos;ilson here explained thestrategical advantages and disadvantages of the two frontierson the map).     He bad told ..Marshal Foch that there was verylittle chance of our subscribing men for garrisoning the bridge-beads except during the period of occupation prior to the signingof peaces      The 7&apos;arshal had replied that he felt so stronglythe necessity of holding these bridgeheads that if we refusedto supply troops he would press upon his Government the necessityof maintaining garrisons with French troops alone with suchassistance as Belgium might be able to afford.
Mr. Bonar Law thought that Fiance might be preparedherself to supply the whole of trie garrisons for the Rhinebridgeheads for a limited &quot;time,  but not permanently, andes time went on and she developed on peaceful and prosperouslines she would be less inclined to shoulder the burden.The Prime Minister said that Msrshal Pooh was not goingon tho assumption of a Germany disarmed, but on that of twoor three millions of German soldiers under arms.    He himselfdid not think: that another war could come for twonty yearsor more, by which time the men forming the existing Germanarmy would be past bearing arms.     He doubted whether thePreach Government were really behind the Marshals proposals,tnough they might appear to be supporting them.    It was unlikelythat Prance would accept permanently the burden of maintaininga garrison of something like 300,000 men on the Rhine.    vfhatwe would say to the ha each was,   that we wore relying upontwo  things:    first, the disarmament of Go.many;    and second,the League of -Actions.    It had to be remembered that fortyyears hence might see a re-shuffling of alliances and afresh grouping of Allies.The Chancellor of tho Exchequer enquired whether it wouldbe possible to hold the bridgeheads with a little force with-ou     uonuoi&amp;itantly a military occupation of the bufferstate.    bo British Government,  in his opinion, could proposegarrisoning the Rhine with our troops beyond the periodrequired to extort reparation end indemnity.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff,  in reply to theChancellor&apos;s question, said that it would be impossible tohold the bridgeheads without securing our lines of aommuni-cations, which would,involve a military occupation of thebuffer state.      If it.were decided that we should taxe ourshare in the maintenance of the Rhine garrisons, our contri-butipn would not be less than five Divisions.The. Acting  Jeo rotary of State for Foreign affairs then
quoted from a telegram from Lord Derby, recording a conversationhe had ted rith M. Clemenceau on December loth last, who, itappeared, was less concerned rith the annexation of territoriesoutside Prance, but was anxious for a French frontier protectedby an independent state with its neutrality guaranteed by theGreat Powers.The prime minister said that &apos;f the United States and our-selves would guarantee Franco  against invasion, France would bequite satisfied.      This, however, was impossible, as the Presidentwould not hear of any entangling alliances, aa he put his faithin the Dengue of Nations *The Acting Secretary&apos;of State for Foreign Affairs enquiredwhether there would he any military advantage in dismantlingthe atrip which it was suggested should be converted into abuffer State.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that such actionwould present very considerable advantages.      It  would takeGermany much longer to deploy fror- the Rhine on the French frontier.The deployment, in fact could not be accomplished in less thanthree weeks.      Had that buffer State existed in 1914, it would havetaken quite that time for the Germans to deploy, and the Britishwould hove been enabled to place their Divisions in Liege and TTamur.^hat be suggested was that no German troops at all should be allowed,in that strip, that there should be no military sidings, ammunitiondumps or barracks, and that Germany should.not be allowed to havea conscript army.      In regard to this latter proposition he was notin accord with his military confreres among the Allies.       Hehimself suggested that we should insist upon a limited voluntary&quot;rmy In Germany because its maintenance would; bo very costly.The Acting Secretory of State for Foreign Affairs thought itwas important that the Chief of the Imperial General Staff shouldwork out Ms views in regard to this middle strip in greater detail.The Prime Minister agreed, and said that he would bo glad
to be in possession of a detailed scheme before the matter-c^me up for discussion in Paris.,    He enquired whether theFrench military, terms of peace had yet been received., Hr.. Bonar Law said that he had seen a copy of them, and.they constituted a mass of pinpricks. Involving everycalculated humiliation.-The-Prime Minister said that, as regards the possibility   (of Germany raising and maintaining a large conscript army,,he thought our best safeguard l?j in the imposition of ahuge indemnity which would pevent the Germans spending-money on an army.    In regard to this indemnity, however, heunderstood, that the    French, and the Americans had now agreedthat it should he no more than  8,00&apos;%000,000,    An we had.been the chief financiers of the &quot;ar, it was intelligiblethat the French and Italians v,-ould not be so greatly con-cemed-about the sise of the indemnity as ourselvesuThe Secretary of State fa&quot;War said that he adhered tohis view.-that we should exhibit a friendly and sympathetic1spirit to the French and support their proposals.    If theFrench proposals were to be turned down at the Peace Congresshe would prefer that the veto should be imposed by theUnited- States and not by ourselves.    He would like* to seea composition at our various differences with the Frenchin regard -to Eos tern&quot; matters,, and to have it on record forhistory*that, when the question of the delimitation of German&apos;frontiers was decided at the Peace Congress, Great Britainhad stood by France...The Acting Secretary Of  State fa1 Foreign Affairs pointedout that the President would not be back in Paris until the14th of the present month.    In the meantime, he would againsuggest that the Chief, of the Imperial General Staff shoulddevelop his programme in regard to the buffer State.    Heagreed with the Secretary cf  State for Lar that, if possible,it should be left to the united States delegates to turn downthe
the extreme proposition of the French..   We could then comeout with our alternative scheme.The War Cabinet decided that -The Chief of  the Imperial General Staffshould develop hi a   -Ideas in detail inregard to his alternative proposal, forthe use of the British delegates in Paris.
RUSSIA!! (2.)      With reference to War Cabinet 537, Minute 2POLICY.&apos;he Secretary of State for War enquired whether theCabinet were prepared to inform him more definitely asto the policy they intended to pursue with regard toRussia.The Prime Minister said that he would take theearliest opportunity on his return to Paris to get thematter discussed by the Peace Conference.    The generalintention of His Majesty&apos;s Government was to withdrawthe armies from every part of Russia as soon aspracticable and then to supply Russian commanders whowere friendly to the Allied cause with guns, aeroplanes,munitions and everything that might be of uso, excepttroops and money.The Secretary of State for War said that as regardsMurmansk and Archangel, it would be impossible forclimatic reasons for us to evacuate the Porces thereuntil June.    In tho meantime, however, we must takesteps to seo that our Porces in both places receiveproper reinforcements.    Purther we should have tosupplement our detachments at those ports in order thatthe withdrawal, when carried out,  should be properlyconducted.  - It was most important that everything shouldbe done to ensure a safe and orderly evaoitation when thetime came.      With a view to hit being in a position tomake adequate arrangements he pressed for a decision ontwo points;-(a) Were we to withdraw/ as soon as theweather permitted, and(b) If we were to evacuate were we alsoto undertake the removal ofinhabitants who were friendlyto us?As regards the Caucasus, how long were o;ir troopsto remain there?    Was it to be until the League ofRations/
Nations bad decided the fate of Georgia?      Further,  inrespect of the Caspian, what did the ^Irst Lord intendto do sft tb the Fleet he Kb. s at present maintaining there?If  T-e cleared out of the Caucasus how should we &quot;makeit up to&quot; General Denekin?&apos;   The deputy Chief of Naval Staff said that theAdmiralty fully recognised that whatever policy H.h.Government adopted, a heavy :respon.s ibility rested upon ;the Navy.      .A  considerable flotilla, which includessix monitors, a repair-  ship, several  special river craft,etc., with about ?., 400 naval ratings, was to start atonce for  the northern parts of Russia in order to arrive atMurmansk by the 1st Hay,  if possible.      The composition ofthe Flotilla had been determined with a view to meetingeither  eventual evacuation or a further advance.      Lastyear we had been overpowered on the river, and it was forthis reason that a substantial number of river craft formedpart of tho flotilla.      The dangerous period would be thefive or six weeks following upon the 1st Hay when the riverwould be open but the r;Thite Sea would be. closed.The Prime Minister said that figures- were an essentialelement when a Government was called upon to decide itspolicy In a case of this kind.      He had only just been putIn possession of figures showing, the cost of all thesevarious Russian commitments.      It appeared that for ourMilitary porces only,  including transport, no leas than 73 millions were required for a period of six months.      Ifthe cost of naval requirements were added,  the total costwould be 150 millions sterling per a^numfor ohat wereafter all very insignificant operations.- ,Tho Chancellor of the Exchequer said that be would
not challenge the charges for the naval pur oses as ourvessels would be required equally whether we decided toevacuate or- advance, -    He himself felt that there was. noQuestion that we ought to withdraw from 7*orth Russia,subject to our Allies&apos; consent.      So far as the Caucasusand Caspian were concerned, we had no obligation to ourAllies, and he  could not see that any British interests  werebeing served by our presence there-The ^irst Lord of the Admiralty agreed that an earlydecision was required as to whether we -ere to evacuateNorth Russia or notnThe Secretary of State for &quot;*ar said that ho himselfwas not responsible for the present situation, and he wasstill uncertain as to what the Cabinet wished done .      He-understood, that authority had been given to take whatevernaval measures might be necessary for the protection of ournaval forces  in North Russia.      He claimed that he equallyshould, be authorised to take adequate military meas tires tosupport and reinforce the men we had in North. Russia untilthey could be withdrawn.-      The sooner he &apos;;ras informed ofthe Government1 a policy the sooner he could start on thepreliminary arrangements-.      Unless he was given the authorityhe required, from the Cabinet, he was deeply apprehensivethat the consequences might be absolutely disastrous.His own wishes were:(a) To evacuate North Russ-ia in such a way that acatastrophe would be avoided..(b) To evacuate the Caucasus, subject to a date agreedupon in Paris.
(c) "To make it up" to General Denekin, and for this purpose he proposed to send a Military Mission for the General&apos;s assistance. This would mean with-drawing about 30,000 men, and sending instead 1,800 N.C.0&apos;s and others who would act an instructors.

(d) To send a similar Mission to Admiral Kolchak and to recall the battalions now in Siberia under Colonel John Ward.

He regarded all these as reasonable propositions, and if our friends in Russia failed to maintain themselves with such assistance as he suggested, he did not think we could be blamed. 

The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thought they were all agreed so far as North Russia was concerned, and suggested the Cabinet should authorise the naval and military authorities to take all necessary measures to ensure an efficient evacuation. As regards the Caucasus, he suggested that the Eastern Committee, which still survived in another form, should be instructed to submit to the War Cabinet a series of proposals as regards a possible evacuation,  indicating its political and other consequences. The case of Georgia had been mentioned. He wished to point out that public opinion in Georgia was not unanimous in regard to the occupation of the country by Allied troops. He would remind the Cabinet that Armenia was trying to establish a Republic, whose precarious assistance was only being sustained by the presence of British troops.

The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said he would be glad if the Acting Secretary of State for


Foreign Affairs would obtain from our representatives in North Russia the numbers of such friendly inhabitants as it might be incumbent upon us to remove.

The Prime Minister said that he fully concurred with his collegues in thinking that the evacuation of Murmansk and Archangel was desirable at the earliest opportunity. He would prose this policy upon the Peace Congress on his return to Paris. As regards the Caucasus, he would welcome the suggestion of the Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that the matter should be discussed, and proposals put forward by the Eastern Committee,  but he trusted that these proposals would be put forward in such a way that the hands of the British Delegates in Paris would be in no way tied.

The War Cabinet decided :-

(a) That their policy should be to press for the early evacuation of Murmansk and Archangel and to authorise the Secretary of State for War to make the necessary preliminary arrangements.

(b) To ask the Prime Minister to communicate the policy of H.M. Government as set out in the above discussion to the other British Delegates in Paris.

(c) To ask the Secretary of State for War to circulate to the War Cabinet the paper he had prepared showing the cost of maintaining our forces in the various centres in Russia.
