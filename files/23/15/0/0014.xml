( his Doouinent is the Property of His Britannicma.1 est y* s Government * )OWAR, 0,A3It,BT 5?g 4.DRAFT of a Meeting held at 10, Downing  Street,  G. &apos;r. 1.,on WEDNESDAY, MAY P8,  1919,  at 1 p.a,TIF POLICE With reference to -&apos;ar Cabinet 571 A., the Home Secretary0HION ANDPOLICE       read to the Cabinet the following Question and Answer relatingPAY .to the Police position, which it was proposed should be put inthe House of Common? that afternoon:-&quot;Mr , &apos;7ailace:-   To ask the Home Secretary whetherhe is aware that a feeling of unrest exists inthe Metropolitan Police Force, and whether hecan make any statement as to any intended actionin the matter.klr Shortt:-    I am aware that a feelinrr of unrestdoes exist in the Metropolitan Police Force,partly due to outside influences and partly dueto genuine grievances,    BO far as their genuinegrievances are concerned the Government aretaking all necessary steps to meet theia,   ACommittee is at the present moment enquiringinto the whole question of the Police pay andconditions of service, and already enough isknown to enable the Government to say thatthere will be a substantial increase in thepay which will be ret respective as from the1st April,&apos; and a substantial improvement inthe conditions. - These changes will be carriedinto effect as soon as the Committee*s Reporthas been received and considered, which, isexpected to be soon.    The Government are alsoarranging that the Police Provident Association,which bras hitherto been upon a most unsatis-factory footing,  should be given statutoryeffect and established on a sound financialbasis, which will safeguard trie interests ofthose members of the Force who have 00nt ri-buted in the past- ,    Further, the Governmentare arranging that the right of the Police totheir own internal organisation for the pro-t set ion of their own interests should be putupon a regular basis.    It will,  of course, beentirely confined to the Police, and entirelyfree from all outside control or1 interference.
!Thile the Police are not a military force theyare not an industrial body arm] cannot be organ-ised upon industrial lines.&quot;The Home Secretary asked if he could state that the increase inpay would be retrospective to the 1st April of this year.    TheCommissioner of Police had informed him that this would have auseful effect on the men, and that if the pay was not to beretrospective the force would gain the impression that LordDesberough&apos;a Committee had been set up only as a means of delay-ing action.The Chancellor of the Bxeheguer thought that in theproposed announcement the Pome Secretary stated that the increaseof pay would take effect as - soon as the Committee reported.   This-would commit the Government to accepting the Report whatever itsnature, and he was of opinion that the Government should not bepledged in this way.The President of the Local Government Board said, withregard to the Provident Association, that he thought words shouldbe inserted indicating that those who had already contributedto this Association would have their interests safeguarded.In answer to a -question, the Home secretary said it wasnot contemplated, making any reference in the House of Commonsthat afternoon to the action the&apos; Government would take in theevent of a strike, but if there was a Supplementary Questionhe might have to state what the views of the Government were.The Home Secretary then read the following statementwhich it was proposed to issue in the Police Orders on the fol-1owing Saturday: -&quot;It having come to the knowledge of the Commie-sioner that a movement is on foot to induce theMetropolitan Police to again withdraw from theirduty to the State, although the Commissioner isconfident that the great majority of the Forcehave no intention of so doing, he. considers that,in view of the events of August, 1918,  it isnecessary for him to make known clearly theconsequences that will overtake any man whomay be led away by persons who place individualinterests before those of the State.
It is to be distinctly understood by 3,11 ranksthat any officer or man of whatever rank who failsto report in the ordinary course of duty or whencalled upon, will be forthwith dismissed from theForce.    Such a man will under no circumstances,/&apos;*   .j        be permitted to rejoin the Metropolitan Police,and dismissal will result in the loss of all idastime that may have been made towards pension,a. The Commissioner will be unable to accept excusesthat men are unable to parade or carry on theirwork owing to intimidation.    Officers and men will,if necessary, defend themselves by all legitimatemeans if interfered with in the execution of theirduty.&quot;&apos;He might add that the Commissioner was still of the opinion that,in spite of the concessions which were being made to the men,there would be a strike, and Mr Hayes, the general Secretary ofthe Union, had told the men to be ready to strike on the followinMonday, and advised resorting to force to keep any men endeavour-ing to do their duty off the streets.Mr Bonar Law doubted whether it was advisable to saythat certificates of illness from private practitioners wouldnot be accepted.    Such an order might have a very irritatingeffect .    He also thought there would be a great outcry regardingthe loss of pension, especially if the strike lasted only a dayor two.The Commissioner of Police said that, although he didnot press that only Police Divisional Surgeons&apos;  certificatesshould be accepted, he thought this course advisable, inasmuchas the men might prevail on certain private practitioners togive certificates without proper cause.    With regard to the lossof pension, he thought this was the one thing that would makethe men hesitate seriously over their proposed action;    in addi-tion, the wives would undoubtedly bring a restraining influenceto bear.A discussion then took place as to the most opportunemoment for issuing the General Order, and the Commissioner saidhis first idea had been to hold it up until after the meetingin Hyde Park on Sunday, but this would mean that there was achance that some of the men would not see the Order before

striking,  and they would use this as an excuse.    His proposalwas, therefore, that the Order should be issued on Saturday, andthis would give the wives an opportunity of expressing their viewsabout the pensions.The First Lord of the Admiralty was of the opinion that,if the Government meant to enforce the penal clauses of the Order,it waa fairer to acquaint the men as to the results of their pro-posed action as soon as possible.      Unless something of this kind,was done,  force would &quot;oe given to the opinion that the Governmentwas trying to buy off sedition instead of dealing with it.    Toa certain extent the seditious movement had received encourage-ment from the erroneous belief that the Government was afraid toact.    He therefore hoped that the Order would be issued on Satur-day, if not that afternoon.    He would again like to draw theWar Cabinet&apos;s attention to the fact that the Navy was keepingan eye on the Police movement, and that any failure to take stemmeasures would, have a bad effect on the Navy.The Postmaster-General concurred generally in the viewsset forth by the First Lord, and urged the desirability of themen realising the Government&apos;s policy before they met on Sunday.The Food Controller thought the proper course would beto issue the Order on Saturday.    He hid that morning seen someof the Trade Union members of the Consumers&apos; Council, who hadadvised him that there would be a strike, although the men whowere behind the agitation were rather nervous of the troublethey had. succeeded in stirring up.    He therefore thought it wouldbe wise to accompany the announcement of the concessions with astatement as to what steps the Government would take in theevent of a strike.The Minister of Labour said, that the men always imaginedthat the Government was using threats, and would/be ready to playup to a challenge, and he did not think that such an announcementwould make matters easier.    With regard to the proposal thatcertificates by private practitioners should not be accepted,
he thought this would cause the greatest suspicion and woi Id beregarded as the G-overnnent*s way of singling out people whom theydesired tc vietiraise.Mr Bonar Law said that the Gaoi.net were now faced with achoice between the Home Secretary&apos;s making a statement that after-noon regarding the Government&apos;s concessions without a threat ofwhat action they would take in the event of a strike, and announo-ing the concessions accompanied by such, a threat.    If the lattercourse were chosen, a big responsibility would be thrown not onlyon themselves but on the Prime Minister, and he would like thePrime Minister to be acquainted with the position before suchaction was taken.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was impressedwith what the Commissioner had said regarding the wives being ao-quainted with the fact that participation in a strike would resultin the loss of pension,  but he feared that if it was announced inthe House of Commons that afternoon that the Government proposedto deal firmly with any insubordination, there might be repeated,such an incident as occurred when lir Bonar Law made his statementimmediately following the Report of the Coal commission.   Thiswas due to one or two thoughtless members in the House.The War Cabinet decided that  (a) The Question and Answer, as amended, regardingthe position of the Police should be given thatafternoon in the House of Commons:(b) The General Order of the Commissioner of Policeshould, subject to the approval of the PrimeMinister, be announced in Parliament on thefollowing Friday, with the deletion of thewords &quot;Any officers or men unable to paradefor duty owing to sickness will obtain a cer-tifioate from a Police Divisional Surgeon.Certificates by private practitioners will notbe accepted&quot;:(c) The Home Secretary should, in his announcementthat afternoon, state that the Government wasprepared to make any recommendations with regardto increase of pay retrospective to the 1st April,or nearest convenient pay day:(d) The above decisions should also aooly to Prisonofficers:(e) The Home Secretary should acquaint the PrimeMinister with the action the Cabinet proposedto tame in the matter,itehall Gardens,  3.W.I., ......
