DRAFT MINUTES of a Meeting held in Mr Bonar Law&apos;s Room. House of Commons, S.W.1., on Tuesday, May 27.1919. at 6-30 p.m.

THE POLICE UNION AND POLICE PAY.

With reference to War Cabinet 528, Minute 5, and War Cabinet 544, Minute 1, the War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Home Secretary regarding Police pay and recognition of the Police Union (Paper G.F.-7329).

The Home Secretary said that the position as regards the Police at the present moment was undoubtedly serious.  He thought it best to inform the War Cabinet, in the first instance, of the results of the arrangements made to meet the Police after the strike last September.  One part of the agreement which had been signed by Mr Marston was to the effect that the representative body of the Police Union should not deal with any matters connected with discipline;  also, that the organisation of the Union should be entirely self-contained and should not connect itself in my way with outside bodies. Mr Marston also signed an agreement which provided that, if the Union took certain steps or broke certain rules, the Government would call upon the men to resign from the Union. All these undertakings, which had been signed by Mr Marston, had been persistently broken by him.  A troublesome feature in dealing with the situation was the fact that, although the main body of the Police were loyal, they had a number of genuine grievances. In addition, there were a number of fire-brands in the Force who were working with confessed Bolsheviks, and this small body of men now controlled the Union and brought
great press euro to bear on Its policy.    These? leaders took up theposition thai any concessions which had he en made by t be G-overfi-mant to the Police were the direct result of the efforts of theUnion, and the men had been persuaded to believe that futureconcessions could only be obtained - through the same channel.Another feature in the situation was the Provident Association.This was not a fund, but there waa a levy made on every subscribe?when a  sember of the Association either retired or died.   PhisAssociation had been in existence since .18-92-, and a number ofthe men had been subscribing to it since its inception.   ThePolice Union had been making great efforts to obtain control,and there .was little doubt that such control would be improperlyused so as to squeeze out any subscribers who were not membersof the Union, and, in effect, to secure the whole Force as meia-bara of the Union.    After a man had been a subscriber for anumber of years he was naturally anxious not to lose the privir-leges of the Association, and, rather than subject himself tothe possibility of such a loss, he would throw in his lot withthe Union even if he were not otherwise disposed to join it.Since January last the Union had been given as much rcpeas they desired., and they had revised their rules, omitting theregulation which prohibited a strike and inserting one whichprovided for a strike on a two-thirds majority in a vote byballot of all meal)ere of the Union.    As an instance of the holdthe Union had obtained over its members, one member of the Force,who had been before the Commissioner for none offence,  had saidthat he felt that his oath, to the Union was more binding thanthe oath he took on joining the fores.To deal with the situation, the &quot;lose Secretary said thatthe commissioner of Police and himself held that the first thingto do was to remedy the grievances of the men.    To this end aCommittee had been set up, under Lord Desborough, to enquire intothe question of pay.   This Committee had not yet been able to
make an Interim Report, but Lord Peaborough had written a letter,attached to the Memorandum under discussion, indicating thereoomisendations it ii?as likely the Committee would make.   In thesecond place, it was thought desirable to place the ProvidentAssociation on a better footing,&quot; and the Commissioner had con-suited the Mortb British and Mercantile Assurance Associationand. had prepared a draft scheme with them, placing the Aseocia-tion on an improved basis.    Further, to meet the men, changeshad been made in the Representative Board.   As this Board wasOriginally constituted it represented all ranks, with, the resultthat an. Inspector might be arraigned before a Constable:   andit wr*a found that- a Board so constituted had a bad effect on thediscipline of the men.    Three Boards had therefore been set up,consisting respectively of (a) Inspectors,  (b) Sergeants, (c)Constables.   The Union had fought this arrangement, but in spiteof this fact the Boards for the Inspectors and Sergeants had beenvery successful, though the  Constables Board had been a failure.Mr Shortt said that hia propositions now were:-(I) That these Representative Boards should now bemade a statutory right, and that in addition tothese Boards there should be a central bodyrepresenting all three Boards, which could dealdirect with the Home Office arid suggest anychanges of policy it was thought desirable tomake;(3) That if the Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed,the Provident Association should be placed ona financially firm basis:(3) That as regards pay, as Lord Desborough had notcommitted himself to particular figures, he pro-posed, for the purpose of an immediate announce-ment, to say that Lord Desborought 9 Committeehad intimated that substantial increases in payshould be made, and that the Cabinet, while theyhad not the actual figures before then, wereprepared to make a substantial increase.It was pointed out that, in any announcement of thissort, care should be taken not to commit the Cabinet in advance.The Pir^t Lord of the Admiralty said that he hoped that,before the Cabinet assented to these increases, they would eon-aider the effect &quot;ihey would have on $aval pay.
The Postmaster-General said that whatever advances were made to the Police would also reflect on the Post Office rates of pay, and, as Lord Desborough in his letter had suggested that Police pay all over the country should be standardised, he would be met by a demand for standardisation from the Post Office employees.

The Secretary for Scotland said that he viewed with alarm any standardisation in Scotland. For instance, although Glasgow would be able to pay 70/- a week, it was doubtful whether poorer Boroughs would be able to do the same, and the result would be that these poorer Boroughs would claim more than the 50 per cent, which Lord Desborough had suggested the Treasury should pay of these increases.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed with Mr Munro, and said that he could not believe that a scale of pay which was appropriate in London would appropriate in, say, Huntingdon.

Lord Desborough (who entered at this stage), in reply to Mr Munro, said that in Scotland the men wanted uniformity of pay, but it should be remembered that, if the Treasury were called upon to pay more than the 50 per cent, in certain districts in Scotland, there were only 6,000 Police in Scotland compared with some 70,000 in England and Wales.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that if the Treasury were called upon to pay more than the 50 per cent in Scotland, they would undoubtedly have to do the same in England.

(The War Cabinet then had some discussion in detail with Lord Desborough regarding the rates of pay, after which he left the Meeting.)

The Home Secretary suggested that an immediate announcement should  be made by the Government promising substantial increases of pay to the Police Force, to finance their Provident Association, and place it on a proper footing, and to set up statutory Representative Boards. He also proposed that the

He also proposed that the




present Polls a Union should be Immediately condemned and themembers of it sailed upon to resign.    In answer to a questionas to why it was necessary to ash members of the Union to resignbefore the threatened strike took place. Mr Shortt said thatthere was an accumulation of reasons since last 3 e-pt ember, andthe agreement then arrived at with Mr Marston regarding strideshad been broken.    lie was doubtful whether to call upon the mento resirn froa the Union would provoke a strike.It was suggested that the Government might announcetheir concessions but refrain from making any reference to theUnion;   then if, after these concessions had been made, the Unionpresented an ultimatum to the Government regarding recognition,the fight might then take place on thin ground.The Commissioner of Police said that the leaders wereout for trouble,  and whatever announcement was made regardingpay, the Provident Association and Representative Boards* themen would, in his opinion, sa/gye the Government with an ultimatumon Monday, and would strike for full recognition of the Union,and perhaps for th^reinstatement of gpackman.The Chancellor of the Pxohequcr said that the weaknessof not coupling the refusal to recognise the Union with theannouncement of concessions was that the Union would claim thatthey had wrung these concessions out of the Government, and sostrengthen their position.It was generally agreed, that a fight was inevitable,and tact the question for.decision was whether the Governmentshould condemn the Union in advance of an ultimatum or strike,or whether they should condemn the Union imaedlately on theissue of an ultimatum or the declaration of a strike.The First lord of the Admiralty appealed to the Cabinetto consider the question on its merits.   The ?fevy was matchingclosely the Police - movement, and if the efforts of the agitatorsand the persistent insubordination in the Force were allowed tocontinue, there was no doubt that it would have a disastrous
effect in the t&amp;vvy. In his opinion the Some Secretary shouldstate, in his proposed announcement, that the Union could notbe recognised.The Minister of Labour said that he was strongly againstissuing in advance a statement that a member of the Police Forceshould not be a member of the Union.    In his opinion such a coursewould precipitate a complete strike and cause the ether Unions tosupport the Police.   As far as he could gather, it was possiblefor the men to have a Union which would be watertight and wouldnot be affiliated to outside organisations.    There was no doubtthat condemnation of the Union in advance of any action by theother aide would rally the whole of the Trade Union world to thedefence of the Polioe Union, en the ground that Trade Unionismwas being menaced.   &amp;&apos;hen a strike came, then, in his view, was    mthe time to take action, and not before. 1Mr Fisher said he agreed with Sir Robert Home;    the      Ifproposed announcement regarding concessions would, have consider-ll11able influence on the moderate element, and if, in spite of such feconcessions, the Union still threatened to striae, then would jflbe the time to take action. 1The Secretary for Scotland said,  in his opinion,  if the 1Government announced &quot;hat  the men must leave the Union, it would Inot only estrange Trade Union opinion, but would decimate thewhole of the Scottish Police as veil.The Postmaster-General said that the men were determined!for a fight, whatever happened, and he thought that the Govern-   [ment would have public opinion on their side if the whole facts   fwere published in the Press together with the proposed conces-sions and the reasons why it was impossible for the Governmentto recognise the Union.The Chancellor of trie Exchequer said he would rather telthe men at once that the Union was incompatible with discipline,and they must leave it.    Before, when the Cabinet had delayed a-   Idecision of this nature,  it had not tended to improve matters.
., Whitehall Gardens, l.,May 28, 1919.Mr Bonar Law said thai the issue narrowed itself downto&quot; whether the Government should announce that they were unableto recognise the Union when the 5Lome Secretary made his statementregarding concessions on the following afternoon, or whether theyshould wait until an -ultimatum was received from the Union andthen make the announcement.   There was no question of the Govern-saent recognising the Union.    He was much impressed by what theMinister of Labour had said regarding precipitate action which&apos;might win over to the Police Union the sympathy of the wholeTrade Union movement of the country.   He did. not want a repetitionof the position the Government had found themselves in during therecent trouble with the Railway Clerks Union.    Personally he waginclined to await the ultimatum from the Union regarding recogni-tion, as this would provide a better ground upon which to fight.He realised., however, that the disadvantage of this course wasthe fact that, when the concessions were announced by the -HomeSecretary, the Union leaders would claim that they were broughtabout solely by the pressure of the Executive, and so strengthentheir position.    It should not be forgotten, however, that theannouncement by the Pome Secretary regarding Pay, the ProvidentAssociation, and statutory provision for Representative Boards,might win over the more moderate element of trie Union, whichmight  then &quot;rote against an ultimatum or a striae on the questionof the recognition of the Union.The 5far Cabinet decidsd  That the home Secretary should prepare a statementin reply to a Question in the House of Commons onWednesday afternoon, embodying the promises inregard to pay. Provident Association and Pepre-sentative Boards,  but not calling on the men toleave the Union, and that this draft statementshould be considered by the Cab inet at one o*clock-on the following day.
