RETSECRETARY&apos; S 110TES of a Meeting of the Jar Cabinetheld at 10 Downing Street,  S.&apos;.&apos;!. ,  on THURSDAY,September  5,  1919.^&apos;/^// st^f.TAR Oh 31 PET 6^4 A.CiTIMATE AIM On the conclusion of the discussion by  the Tar Cab-E BRITISHOLICY IB inet on the subject of British policy  towards tine  BalticUSSIA.States  (far Cabinet 6 4 (1))  THE BBIMB MINISTER saidhe would liice the Cabinet to- consider what should be theultimate aim of British policy in connection with Russia.The  question was would it be in tne interests of the 3rit-ish Empire  to aim at a limited Russia under any govern-ment    , whether it was Bolshevist or anti-Bolshevist, orof any other tendencies, however good it might be.    Itwould be inevitable that such a government would have anatural inclination to creep forward and,  as Bord Beacons-field had pointed out in connection with the situation inthe past,  such a development would  ,  he  thought,  resultin a peril not only  to  the  British Empire, but to  the peaceof  the world.    The other alternative was  to aim at havingcertain independent states such as the Ukraine, and pos-sibly Turkestan.    The population of the Ukraine was dif-ferent to  that of the rest of Russia and consisted prin-cipally of peasant proprietors.    The Cossacms were alsodifferent in their characteristics from the people  ofNorth and Central Russia.    The future of the British Em-pire might depend on how  the Russian situation developed,and he personally did not view with equanimity the  thoughtof a powerful united Russia of IPO,000,000 inhabitants.It was very essential that the British representatives inParis should tcnow what was the ultimate aim of our Russianpolicy.
THE ACTING SECRETARY OF STATE TOE FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat about a- fortnight previously he had had a paper pre-pared in the foreign Office on  this very question, and withthe concurrence of  the Cabinet he would like  to circulate it.-THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TAR thought  the question avery delicate one and  that in view of the fact that fourmillion Russians had been fighting with us in the war itwould be somewhat cold-blooded to suggest now that we did notwant  to see a limited Russia in the future.     whatever we didhe did not think the choice was open to us and that within afew years we should see a    united Russia and  that from thenon the Russians would never cease to claim any territoriesthat might now be lopped off what was  the old Russian Empire.When this time came he hoped we should  be on good terms withthem and not the reverse.THE PRIME MINISTER said everyone was against the Bol-shevists and some were at the  same time very suspicious of theAnti-Bolshevists.    Mr.  Paderewski was frightened of generalDenikin,  and  the people around him.    It was his,(the PrimeMinister&apos;s)  own conviction that general Denikin was helpingto bream up Russia.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER agreed with the PrimeMinister as regards what should be the policy of the BritishGovernment, but said he agreed with  the Secretary of State forTar as regards prophecy.THE MINISTER OF EDUCATION agreed that from the Britishpoint of view it was desirable  to have a divided Russia but hethought that the forces tending towards a limited Russia wouldbe  tremendous.The War Cabinet decided:-That the Acting Secretary of State should circulatea Memorandum on trie subject,  but,  in the interestsof secrecy,  that he should be asked only to circulatea single copy in a box.hitenall Gardens,  S.W. ,September 26,  1919.
