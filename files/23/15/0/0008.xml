53(This j^po/vuaent^ig^the..Property of KlsBritannic Ji^A^.MiyLL3.-SlS2L^.rn^ni-i &apos; )WAR OABIMBT 546 A.DRAFT MISUSES of a Meeting held at 10, Downing Street, 3.W.I.,on WEDNESDAY, MAM 19,  1919, at 11-30 a.ra.of Labour, at the request of Mr Bonar Law, read to the Cabineta letter which&apos;had been received from the Prime minister withregard to the forthcoming Report of the Coal Industry Corarois-sion.    The Minister of Labour then explained to the Cabinethis view of the situation.    He said that if the miners cameout on strike it waa probable that the railwayman and thetransport workers would follow,    The railwaymen might delayfor a day or two, but not for long.    The-attitude of theminers was pussling, but the balance- of probability was per-haps on the side of their striking if the Report of the Com-taission did not concede their full demands on the Questionsof wages and hours,    With regard to nationalisation of themines, he understood that hr Justice S&amp;rikey would not reportin favour of nationalisation at this stage, as he (Mr JusticeSankey) did not think that there was sufficient evidence tojustify such a course.    Mr Justice Gankey was of opinion,however, that the present system of running the mines stoodcondemned, and that some organisation involving unified controlwould be necessary.    It was probable that the miners&apos; represent-atives on the Commission, and Mr Sidney $ebb, would press for amore positive statement than this.    On the other hand, theminers might ta,ie the view that if they struck at this moment
W* 54they would lose their chance of obtaining nationalisation.We Bonar Law said that the political possibilities shouldbe taken into account. The House of Commons was under the im-pression that at the present moment the nationalisation of themines would not be reported on by the Commission, and it wouldbe difficult to aek them to pass legislation in regard to thismatter at such, short notice. Moreover, if the miners threatenedto strike on the question of nationalisation and the Governmentpave way, it would mean abandoning the functions of Governmentby agreeing to a sectional demand in order to prevent a strike.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it would be suicid-ai for the Government to commit itself to the principle of nation-alisation oafore it was known,what it involved, especially as nodefinite scheme had yet been put before them.The First Lord of the Admiralty doubted whether the Govern-merit could concede the principle of nationalisation when eo littleconsideration had been given to the subject.Mr Bonar Law pointed out that the Prime Minister&apos;s letter,which, had just been read to the Cabinet, expressed the view thatthe Government should not concede the principle of nationalisa-tion at this stag e,Sir Brie Geddes drew attention to the fact that such a con-cession would immediately be followed by a similar demand on thepart of the railwayman, for the nationalisation of railways, andthe two problems involved financial considerations of very greatmagnitude and complexity.The Minister of Labour then informed the Cabinet as to whathe thought would be the nature of the Coal Commission&apos;s Reportwith regard to the two questions of wages and hours.   With regardto hours, he thought the Commission would agree unanimously -to areduction from 8 to 7, which meant a working day of 8 hours and40 minutes at the face;    in other words, a clear reduction ofone hour per day in the hours of labour.    He thought the miners,while content with this immediate reduction of the hours to 7,
.0 O ovowld press for a pledge of a farther reduction to 6, to comeinto operation at the end of the year.   &quot;hith regard to wages,the Commission might report in favour of conceding rather morethan half of what the miners demanded..  i.e., 3/- a day increase.This a/- was inclusive of the I/- already offered, by the Oov-ernment.    This concession would cost the Government  16,000,000a year,  but it was hoped to reco\ip some of this by furthereconomies and better organisation of the mines.    The Commissionwould probably recommend that the reduction in hours shouldbegin in July, and. the increase in pay should begin fromFebruary 1st,    The basis on which the %/- advance would begranted would be by redxicing the eoalmasters&apos; profit to Is.2d.a ton.    The  S3,500,000 which had previously gone to the Kxohe-quer in Bxcesa Profits Ditty would now go into the pockets ofthe miners.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said the Government wasalready paying the loss on the inefficient coal mines, -as the15 per cent- set aside for that purpose had proved insuffieient.The question of the State making such a grant had been raisedin the house of Commons when the agreement with the ccalownerawas being ratified by the house, and an assurance had been giventhat further charges under this head would not be paid out ofa Vote of Credit, but that a Bill for the purpose would beintroduced, if necessary.    The hoard, of Trade had already beengiven - 2,000,000 from the Vote of Credit, and were now asking^ a total ofTor a tart nor  1,000,000, which might rise to  10,000,000.    Itwould -therefore be necessary to transfer these charges from theCivilVote of Credit to the Contingencies Bill./The President of the Board of Trade said that, in the viewof the Coal Controller&apos;&amp; Department, when the financial arrange-ments with the coalowners were wound up the Fund would be solventand the losses now being paid would be recouped.    There was muchthat was artificial in the present position, and it was difficultto forecast how it would develop^ but he would have a Memorandum

on the subject prepared and oiroxilated to the ^ar Cabinet.The Secretary of State.for War said that when the CoalCommission&apos;s/Report was published on the following day thegovernment would have to decide whether, they&quot; would pay the,increased, wages and grant the reduotion in hours.   The Sovern-zaent, however, could not agree to nationalisation withoiit a.further&apos; Report from the Commission.   The miners might then strikeon the subject of nationalisation.    (SIR ROBERT HORNB; &quot;Combined,with wages.   The miners. would .&apos;say. that their full demands forwages had not been grant ed*.):   It. would be fatal to the authorityof Parliament to be forced to grant the:principle of nationalisa-tion at this stage, and the Government should make its fight onthe ground that to endeavour to foroe Parliament into&apos;conceding .this principle was an. usurpation of the powers of Parliament.If the miners wanted nationalisation&quot; they should-&apos;agitate&apos;-for itby political means, as they did with the Eight Hours- Bill.   Onsuch an issue the Government could take its stand with confidenceThe President of the Board of Trade said, that we were - still&apos;carrying on the control of the mines under the Defence of theRealm Act, and the question arose as to.how.-long this controlshould be carried on.   The agreement with the coalowners wasfor six. months after Peace, but the- Government possessed theright to terminate that agreement at any time.Lord Curaon said that the Commission&apos;s Report would bereceived On the following afternoon, when the Cabinet wouldhave to decide three questions:   (a) reduction of hours;(b)- increase of wages;    (c) nationsIdeation.   The Prime Ministerhad expressed his-approval of concessions under (a) and (b),and in face of the Report it would probably be difficult: to holdout under these heads.   There remained nationalisation.   The  .Government could not be forced into conceding such a principlewithout discussion, and if the miners &quot;struck on this questionthere would7be an - enormous, body of opinion, behind the Government.&quot;
The Pirst -Lord of the Admiralty said that if there was tolsj ; be a Triple Alliance strike on Saturday, the measures -which theGovernment proposed to take should be decidedaipon either todayor tomorrow.The War Cabinet decided that -(a) The.Home Secretary should send to the Prime&quot;     Sinister, an outline of. the preparations.theGovernment were making to meet, a possiblestrike of the Triple Alliance:(b) The Minister of labour should take steps toinform the Press of the Government&apos;s ease,with special reference to Mr Smillie&apos;sdeclaration on nationalisation to the PrimeMinister, and to the arrangement   concludedv with the miners.&apos; Parliamentary representativesin the:.House of Commons.BIKES (%) The War Cabinet had before them the draft of a StrikesCOPTIC ML)HSURBS     (Exceptional Measures) Bill (Paper G.T.-S998) which had been&amp;.&apos;..- ,    ,     : ;-A... prepared by the Industrial Unrest Committee in order to meetany situation which might arise from a strike of the TripleAlliance at the end of the week;   and a Memorandum by the HomeSecretary on the use of troops during the threatened strike(Paper 0.T.-699?).The Home&apos;Secretary explained - the --&quot;details of the Bill.   The&apos; :preamble dealt with the fact that the strike contemplated was aconspiracy against the State.   Clause 1(a) made it an offence toincite anypersons to take part in a strike of this nature. ThisClause might entail the imprisonment of officials of the higheststanding - in the various unions, some of whom were Members ofParliament..The Secretary .of State for War said that it would be a/very serious thing to arrest- eminent Trade Union leaders, and he&apos; advocated vthe:.int:rbdttction of; words which would&apos;&apos;-allow - the&apos;&apos; Govetfn-ment to pick and choose as to who should be arrested.Clause 1(b) dealt with the confiscation of Trade Uhiohfunds.    In this connection the Borne Secretary said it was proposed:h&apos;-&quot;.&apos;&apos;...7&apos;77&quot;V .7 &apos;7;-&apos;--&apos;:--&apos;-7-.5-&apos;&quot;-.-- --&apos;-&apos;7 7-:&apos;7 -   &apos;    --&apos;&apos;:&apos;. -,77.77&apos;-&apos;/
to aak the Treasury to dec la A Monday and Tuesday of the follow-ing week to be Bank Holidays,An order that the banks shouldnot pay out, strike funds. \        . hiThe, Oha no ell or of the Bxeh&amp;juer pointed out that this wasa very drastic step, and would create a very serious dislocationof business and much perturbation.\The Home Secretary thought th.yb if the Bill could be passedthrough both Houses by Sunday afternoon, it might not be neees-sary to ask the Treasury to close the banks, but if the Bill wasnot passed through Parliament by that time he feared thatTreasury assistance would have to be asked in this connection.It was suggested that it might be possible to attachTrade Union funds under the Defence of the Realm Act, but itwas pointed out byvthe Minister of Labour that strike pay wasdealt with hinder the Munitions of War Act, Part I, which had:been repealed..Clause 3 gave the Government power to close public houses.Clause S gave power to declare a rent moratorium.   Theobjection to inserting this Clause was that it would help thestrikers as well as other people.The Secretary of State for War said he hoped the Bill hadbeen considered from the point of view of&apos; Parliamentary pro-eedure, so that there would be no difficulty in rushing itthrough the House, with the aid of a closure resolution.The dissuasion&apos;waa adAougned.&quot;Whitehall Gardens, SMarch 19, 1919.    ,   .
