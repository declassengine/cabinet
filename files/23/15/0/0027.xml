TRADE POLICY.



1. The War Cabinet resumed the discussion on the trade policy of the Government, which had been adjourned at the meeting hold that morning.

   Mr. Bonar Law said that he had given a great deal of thought to this matter, and had in his own mind a clear idea of the statement the Prime Minister should make on the subject. He would suggest that the Prime Minister should begin by saying that everyone must realise that the  trade conditions of this country at the present time were abnormal, and it was therefore impossible to lay down any permanent trade policy.

  The condition of the Exchanges alone gave an illustration of this fact. It was evident that it was not possible to deal with the problem on the old Free Trade lines, and it was equally impossible to deal with on the old Tariff Reform basis, owing to conditions due to the War.  We should start with the idea that the future trade policy of this country must be decided when the condition of affairs had assumed a more normal aspect. The Government had accepted the policy of anti-dumping, and were committed to it. If the temporary policy of the Government could not be dealt with by a tariff, there were only two methods which, in his opinion, presented themselves. The first was, to leave everything alone; and the second was, for a Government Department to deal with the question by a system of licenses. If the latter course was adopted, the system on which they were worked must be much freer than at the present moment, and the Department which decided upon licenses would have to consider every commodity by itself, and take into consideration not only the relation of supply


to demand, but also the persons who had a monopolyof anyarticle using that monopoly to obtain unfairprices.    It was only necessary for him to add thatthe key industries of this country could.be dealtwith by this system.    Tho Government was, however,faced with a difficulty which r/ould apply to thecountry as well as to the House of Commons, and thatwas an. absolute detestation of Government control.It should bo made clear to everybody that there wasreally no alternative course between this system anddoing nothing at all.    As for tho method;, ho won-dcrcd whether it would be possible to sot up StandingCommittees, such as obtained in Franco.    By thismoans tho President of &apos;tho Board of Trade would have-to justify any measures he desired to take before aParliamentary Committee, and ho would thus beassured of tho approval of the majority before anyregulations ho made wore enforced.    If this coursewas not possible., he would recommend that a Corn-mission of  two or throe influential Ministers shouldjoin with tho President of tho Board of Trade Inaccepting the responsibility of regulating thelicense system.    The change ho had suggested was notin the direction of greater protection, but, ontho contrary, gave more freedom.    Regarding, thosuggestion of Government co-partnership and a Gov-crnrnont subsidy for the stool industry, he was surethat the remarks which the Prime Minister had alreadymade with regard to the abnormal profits of this tradehad made it evident that such an undertaking couldnot bo contemplated,    Under his proposition tho coun*-try would got imports, an-&apos; tho object of more importswas to break prices.    It would not bo necessary to
make up to the consumer the full level of the imported price, because the quantity of imports would be insufficient. What the country needed was revenue, and the Government would gain revenue by having the power to grant licenses.

 Mr. Bonar Law added that, if the Prime Minister decided to appoint a small Committee to go into the question of the trade policy of this country, he would be glad to incorporate in greater detail in a Memorandum the views he had expressed above, for the use of such a Committee.

The Minister of Shipping said that he was in general accord with the views expressed on this question by Mr. Barnes that morning. His strong opinion was that nothing but blight resulted from Government control.

 He regretted the tendency of the Government to interfere with business, and felt sure that nothing but harm resulted.  For the future prosperity of this country we must look to individual enterprise, and the idea was too prevalent that in Government departments shipowners and other, did not know their own business. The main cause of the present high price of food was faulty distribution, and once the ports could be cleared he thought that distribution would be easier. As regards dumping, he held the view that the pre-war dumping did more good than harm. As regards tonnage there need be no anxiety, as there was more effective tonnage at the present moment than in the history of the world. In reply to a question, Sir Joseph Maclay stated that, as regards Great Britain&apos;s tonnage position, we were some 2,000,000 tons down, but he added that we could not expect to retain the carrying trade of the world altogether. Sir Joseph Maclay concluded by pleading for the non-interference of the Government with private enterprise, as he felt sure that private /


enterprise would find a way out of the present difficulty even though the Government found it hard to discover a solution.

 The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he wished he could agree with the remarks of the Shipping Controller with regard to private enterprise, but his experience was that the latter was extraordinarily slow to move. He found that, although traders at one moment condemned Government control, yet the next they said that they were unable to trade unless the Government provided the necessary capital. One could not rely on private enterprise doing all that it would have done before the War. He agreed with the remarks made by Mr.Bonar Law, that whatever our pre-war fiscal policy had been, the present was not the moment to attempt to settle a permanent policy. He was anxious, however, to find a solution which would bring private interests into full play. In his view, the lack of a sense of security did the country a good deal of harm before the War. He thought it material, however, that in any policy the Government now adopted, they should earnestly endeavour to avoid further subsidies, to industry by the Exchequer. In the Memoranda by the President of the Board of Trade now before them,  there were numerous proposals for Government financial assistance, and, if they carried out the proposals as they stood, the commitments of the Government would be enormous. He hoped the Committee which the Prime Minister proposed to appoint would eschew subsidies. He thought he ought to add that,  a propos the Bread Subsidy, he had said in his speech, without any intention of pre-judging the question they were now discussing, that the policy of the Government was not to create new subsidies. He was of the opinion that there was no way of allowing goods into


tiiia country fairly except by charging a licensefee;   he hoped that this fee would   vary in proportionto the class and the quantity of gooda imported., andthat no fixed foe, which could not ho&apos;increased, wouldbo charged.     He thought the Government wao entitledto obtain a revenue by this method,  and the state ofthe Exchequer made it essential to obtain all thatwas poaaible in this way,     His idea of a licensefee was practically contained in the indented passageof paragraph 3 of the President of the Board of Trade!aMemorandum (Paper G.T.  79P-6).     To sum up, ho agreedwith the -propositions put forward by Mr0Bonar haw,and deprecated the establishment of any new subsidies,and hoped that the Goveminent wo nil  obtain as muchrevenue aa poaaible from the license system,The Home Secretary said that he had read theMemoranda by the President of the Beard of Tradewith great interest,, but he must eonfeos that paragraph4 of Paper G...T. 7906 had filled him with profounddistrust..     The suggestions made by Mr.Bonar   Law ;however, had been a great. relief.     Inasmuch as theCabinet were now discussing purely temporary measures,he   hoped they would not adopt any measure which wouldtie their hands in the future..
He agreed with a great deal that Sir Joseph Maclay had said, but he did not think it possible for private enterprise to accomplish everything that was necessary in order to restore industry. The State would have to give some help. So long as it was understood that anything now decided upon would not have the effect of tying the hands of the Government in regard to our future permanent trade policy he could whole-heartedly support Mr. Bonar Law&apos;s proposition.

 The Secretary of State for the Colonies stated that he was perhaps the only one who had yet spoken who was in complete agreement with the general lines of the policy indicated, in the memorandum of the President of the Board of Trade (G.T.7906) and he would like to express at once his appreciation of the comprehensive nature of that paper, dealing as it did with almost every economic trade question and covering the whole field of the trade policy of the country.     With regard to that policy, it appeared to him that the fact that duties were proposed for a limited number of articles only served to distract attention from the chief point at issue. As long as an industry which was shown to be vital to the country -- industries which had been proved to be good and wore in themselves of a high order, encouraging a high standard of technical skill - as long as those industries could be preserved he was quite indifferent how it was done. He had no particular affection for tariffs, and if the department responsible for our policy felt that it could secure for the industries shown in paragraph 4 of the memorandum the same advantages which it was proposed to obtain for the industries in paragraph 3 by some other means than by a tariff he had no objection. The principal object at which he aimed -- and it was an object that could not be attained by leaving matters alone and allowing private enterprise to carry on by itself -- was a flourishing and well-balanced state of industry, particularly as regards those branches of industry which


called for groat skill or in which was involved tho ad-vancomcnt of science.     He was therefore raoro than a littlealarmed to see the growing disproportion between our importsand exports.     The position in this country was that we musthave large imports both of food and of the raw materialsupon which our&apos; industries depended, but at present wo werenot providing by our exports for the payment of these imparts,normally we paid for oxir imports partly by tho interest weobtained on our foreign securities and partly by the servicesrendered by our shipping in carrying the goods of theworld;    but both of these assets were now considerablyreduced, and the balance of imports was badly against us.The point therefore was, how could wo meet this position?How could we -pay tho outside world for tho tilings whichthat world has to provide uo with?     In tho first place,there must ho a number of things which we wore importingand which we ought to produce eursolvos.     A great numberof articles we had to import, such as tea, and the produceof tropical countries;    but he felt very strongly that woshould reduce to a minimum all unnooossary Imports, and.develop as far as we could our home industries so thatwe might increase our export trade.     Fo believed that thebalance against us could be reduced by from fifty to ahundred million pounds by a proper development of agricult-ure throughout the country.      Since cur compulsory importsreaohod such an enormous figure it was a great mistaketo import any article vfcich was not absolutely essentialeither for our sustenance or for our industries.     Itmight be cheaper to import certain goods, but unless thosegoods wore necessary for the development of a home industry,it would bo better to pay a little more for an articlecade in this country than a little loss for an article whichwould only pile up tho tale of imports against us.     Themain thing was tho maintenance of the great basic industries
of tli i s co mi try.How best to attain that object it w&amp;snot possible to saj/ at the moment, and the policy wouldhave to be considered very carefully.     With rogard to thearticles mentioned in p aragraphs 3 and 4 of Sir AucklandGeddes&apos; memorandum, these wo had to have, but they shouldnot be imported;    and whether foreign manufactures were keptout of the&apos; oountry by tariff or by licence was immaterialso long as it v/as done.     ho not let tho country lose theopportunity of retaining those valuable industries whichhad been started here now for tho first time.     That was oneof the fundamental doctrines of free trado   that allnational industries should bo protected.     If these industriescould live in this country but were unable to stand foreigncompetition, then let the Government preserve them againstthat competition.Sir Eric aeddes suggested that although Lord hllrerappeared to draw a great distinction between an ad valoremlicence and a tariff, the3^ wore In effect the same thing.The Secretary of State for the Polonies, concluding,said that whore tho Government assisted any industry theywore entitled to see that the industry itself did its bestand also that when assistance vae   given the businessshould not be slovenly conducted.Tho President of the Board of Education said that therewere one or two points which ho woaid like to state (l) asfar as ho could judge, public opinion generally, andparticularly in the business world, was opposed to Govern-merit&apos; interference in trade;    (2) there was a great scarcityboth in this country and all    over the world and more andmore and more goods were necessary in order to re-startindustry on a sound basis;    (3) in the third place ho was oftho opinion that technically and administratively our in-dustries had been enormously strengthened as the result ofour &quot;far experience, and we. were now in a far stronger position
to fight the competition of the world than we were before the War. That was an argument for allowing complete freedom from restraint so that people might have the support-unity to fight. On the other hand, there was the question of the Exchange, and that was a serious matter. It was heavily against us in the United States and in our favour as regards Germany; that is to say, we were in an unfavourable position with regard to America, but on the other hand Germany, which had been our most formidable rival in Europe before the War, had had a serious time during the War and might in the next few years be less able to compete with us than it had ever been. The position on the whole was one of exceptional difficulty, and he agreed with Mr.Bonar Law that the Government should, for the time being, content themselves with a temporary policy. The only criticism he could offer was that as regards the suggestion that the principle of licences should be adopted not only for the articles referred to in Sir Auckland Geddes memorandum but should cover the whole economic sphere, that would involve what he regarded as an excessive interference with our trade. Would it not be better to restrict licences to those articles coming from parts of the world such as Germany, where the exchange was in our favour?

 Mr.Bonar Law stated that he had considered that; but it would be very difficult to discriminate between one European country as against another.

 The President of the Board of Trade pointed out that such a policy would immediately lead to discrimination directed against ourselves.

 The President of the Board of Education said that it appeared to him that an enormous administration would be required if one Government Department had to consider the position, in regard to licensing, of every parcel of goods imported into the country.


ifjp.5&quot;ieaai&apos; Law said that his proposal did not quite    229amount to that.       hat tho aopartment    ould have,to decidewaa the quantity ox each class of goods that they would allowto he imported.The 1resident of the &quot;hard of Trade said that even thenthe difficulty of discriminating as &quot;between tho countriesfrom which exports were allowed or as between the traderswho imported those goods was immense.      Since . arch,  hehad been engaged in the policy of removing as many restric-tions on imports as possible, but had not been as successfulas he would have liked,      V&apos;or really, we imp-or ted a millionpairs of boots and shoes from America, and at present wewere licensing an import of 5&quot; per cent   of the normalquantity;    but the amount to bo licensed must be fixed uponsome particular basis, and it was impossible to decide theproportion to be imported&apos;without obtaining particulars fromevery importer of these articles from America,  otherwisethe government would ho accused, of helping some businesses,and of ruining others.     Other firms imported boots fromPrance or other countries, and the same consideration appliedin those cases too.The Prime minister suggested that that was one of theproblems which could be dealt with by the Committee which itwas proposed to set up to look into the question.The President of the Board of    Education, continuing,said that he was merely throwing out tho suggestion that asystem of licensing night break down on account of practicaldifficulties;    and as an alternative he world like the Cabinetto consider the possibility of allowing free import foreverything except the few articles that oould compete to thedisadvantage of the limited&apos;class of what might be consideredoar key industries.     He thought that, by doing this, ourbig ina.ustries would be given the incentive to re-startimmediately;   while mt the same time the Government might re-serve power to impose restrictions on all classes of importsif, at some future date,  it should be found necessary to do thl
The President of the Board of Trade said that in hishadMemorandum h6f. started off with control of imports - theinterim policy of tho country - and then proceeded to thecontrol of Imports in bulk from enemy countries.      Asregards licences, if it was decided to introduce themeven on a very limited system, a very considerable servicewould be  required to administer it.Mr. Bonar haw thought there was no material differencebetween his own proposals and those of the -President of theBoard of Trade 1s, -Tho President of the Board of Trado said that syntheticdyes were covered by Articles 3 and 4, but not the fifteenthousand or so articles that were imported into this countryMr. Bonar Law said that ho had not intended universallicences, but licences for certain selected articles whichmight require special assistance.The Chancellor of the ruchequer said that he -understoodthat Mr. Bonar Law proposed to have a limited system oflicences to be exercised with discrimination.The Secretary of State for &quot;rar remarked that such asystem would really be a form of camouflaged protection,The First Lord of the Admiralty said, that as anagriculturist he was In agreement with Ford Milner&apos;s views;but he thought that the latter somewhat exaggerated theadvantages that were likely to accrue.      If they wished toincrease their home supplies this could only be done byplacing agriculture on a sounder footing.      They would haveto wait some years, however, before any substantial results-would be obtained. -Sir Trie Geddes said that what the country wished toknow was where It stood In regard to trade, and. suggestedthat the Prime Minister should, give come general Idea ofwhat the policy of tho Government would be after the next
six or twelve months *     They were agreed that the measureto prevent dumping would be a permanent part of our policy,,It would not, however, help or satisfy tho trading communityto bo merely told that the Government intended to proceedby way of licences,     They wanted something more than atemporary basis and it was the uncertainty as regards thefuture that was cramping them.Tho Secretary of State for the Colonies pointed outthat a short list of articles which wore to be controlledwas definitely to be announced,,Sir Eric Geddes pointed, out that the country wouldattach more value to the announcement if it were alsostated that there would bo no control outside that list.-The trade would not have much use for an interim policywhich was only to carry us over the next half year or so.Tho Minister of Labour, in reply to a question by thePrime Minister,, said that his views accorded with those ofthe President of the Board of Trade ...The Minister of    ensions was in favour of a moreextensive restriction of Imports and cited, the case of fivethousand motor cars which were now on their way from theUnited States.,.     This meant two millions sterling againstthe American exchange,and a consequent rise in the price offood,..     Imports of this kind, by throwing the balance ofexchange against us, was bound to affect tho cost of living,Mr. Bonar Law thought that this argument was capableof universal application...The Mood Controller said that tho war had entirelyaltered our position, which had previously been that of thepremier credit   . country in the world.      Our exports had beendiminished and our imports increased.      These now conditions-If-
forced our hands and made it essential that we should take whatever action might be necessary to assist and safeguard our own people. In theory, he was a Free Trader, but theories had to be sacrificed when one was confronted with facts.

As he had said, our situation had been changed by the war but it was essential that we should be a more exporting than importing country. The fundamental point was that our shipping must balance our imports. As one who had been brought up in the country, he was particularly interested in agriculture. Generally speaking, he agreed with Lord Milner&apos;s views.

 The Postmaster General asked whether the Government were committed to licences.

 Mr. Bonar Law replied that they were committed to nothing. 

 The Chancellor of the Exchequer said, that they were committed in one particular respect and that was Dyes.


The Prime Minister stated that., in the main, he was inagreement with Mr Bonar Law in regard to the sulhbecto wirioh .had attracted most attention among the speakers, at the twomeetings held that  day.    In his view, it was not the prin-ciples of Tariff Reform and Free Trade which had to he con-sidered, but the whole Trade Policy of the country.    Matterswhich raised controversial issues formed only a small partof the problem.   That were the principal difficulties in theway of getting business right in Great Britain?    First, therewere the Labour troubles.    The output was limited;    the strikcontinued, and there was general unrest.    If only those couldbe put right, passably 75 per cent, of our difficulties wouldbe adjusted.    He was very anxious to get the discussion onthe right lineSj. and the problem viewed in itshroper proper- .tions,.    He deprecated, treating trade policy as a question oflicenses, which, after all, only concerned about  mB per- cent,of our trade..    At. the present time wages were disproportion-ate to output., not because wages were high, but because out-put was poor.   We had to face the serious competition ofAmerica, where the output in proportion to the hours workedwas considerably greater than in this country.    The secondpoint was.the block at our ports, which was a very seriousit dm in the general interference with business.    Cur exportswere not what .they should be.    This waa partly due to theminers&apos;  strikes in Yorkshire., and Labour troubles generally.Owing to the block at the ports, ships could not get going.Consequently we had to increase our transport facilitiesand our ways and communications in order to remove the con-gestion at the ports, which was stopping the machine andinterfering with output.    Agitators seized hold of thiscongestion as the explanation of our falling off in trade,but, as a matter of fact, this falling off was largely due totheir own action.    This was one of the matters which hadto be put right at once.    Thirdly, there was the question ofhigh prices, which undoubtedly  interfered with business, as
builders and others refused at present  to accept contracts,ho proposals as regards pu^enahere.    Lastly, there -ere the  --exchanges, which tended atpresent to encourage imports from Germany and exports to theUnited States.    Those, in his opinion, were our main diffi-culties,  and lie hoped that his  colleagues would give himlight on the several problems, so that he might, when hecame to explain to Parliament the position of our futurepolicy,  be in a position to say something of an encouragingnature.    An appeal,  of course, might be made to Labour toino cease its exertions and develop output.Sir- Eric Geddes interposed to say that he thought theprivate trader -was largely to blame for the congestion, ashe would not unload his wagons.The Prime minister said these were the questions uponwhich the country wanted light thrown, and encouragement.If those could be set right, trade and business could be re-started,    lie agreed that there was a good deal  of feelingbot^ in Parliament &quot;and the country about Government inter-ference,    The nation generally did not like too much inter-fer-er.ee ,    Since their meeting that morning he had interview-ed the General  Secretary of the Iron and Steel Association,who said that the  industry wanted some sort of pledge fromtho Government that they would be left alone, and he hadbeer, informed that any attempt to impose Protection on theiron and steel trade would rend it from top to bottom. Thetrade, he understood, was doing exceedingly well,  in spiteof the fact that many iron and steel businesses we-re extra-ordinarily inefficient and their works completely out of dateHe felt, therefore, that the first thing the Government hadto do was to deal with the existing situation with referenceto the things of the moment.    He did not agree with SirEric Geddes that there was any necessity or obligation todeclare cur policy for the future,    tfhat they had to do wasto adopt a policy which would set trade coin- once mor-e-.
Turning to controversial questions, the Prime Minister saidthat controversy centred mostly on the trivial side of prob-lems.   At the last Election the Coalition Manifesto issuedby himself and Mr Bonar Law embodied three main points:-(i) The maintenance of existing Eutiest(ii) The danger of depending on other natidnsfor commodities which were vital to thelifebf our own trr.de and the protection,of eur key industries:(iii) If production was to be maintained at homewe must make proper provision against unfairforeign competition.The above constituted the three definite pledges which hadbeen given at the time of the Election.    So far as he himselfwas concerned, he stood by all tfwse pledges, and he thoughtthat this was the case with all his colleagues.    The guestionremained, how to apply Protection, and to what subjects?    TheFirst Commissioner of Works had asked whether they wehre toassume that articles required in wartime were likely to berequired again for the same purpose.    In reply, he would saythat we hoped that war was finished and would not come againin our time.   To attempt to build upon that assumption, how-ever, would be to tempt war.    No-one, a year before the tfar,ever imagined that we could be engaged to such an extentas to have to produce steel and make optical glasses, andother munitions, as had been found necessary.   57e had antici-pated that the utmost we should be required to do would beto maintain an army of 10w,000 or so men on the Continent,but not armies amounting to three or four millions in variousparts of the world.    As, however, we had created these specialindustries for war purposes, he thought it would be unwisenot to maintain them on such a scale as would render usindependent of foreign countries should we ever be forcedinto war again.   He suggested that the Committee to be setup to go into our trade policy should &quot;examine this problem,that is, the best method&apos; of keeping those industries alive.
His second proposition was this:    we had accepted the prin-ciple that certain industries of ours should be protectedagainst any attempt  to destroy them by means of foreign  &quot;tariffs.    Such competition was not fair,  although,  in thomain, he agreed with the Shipping Controller that competi-   -tion generally was good for industry.    Ke hoped the ParCabinet would agree that legislation against dumping shouldbe introduced, and that we should. :-ake a clear declaration tothat effect.    Dumping at present was not,  perhans, an immedm-ate menace;    but when people bad invested capital in indus-tries which might be swamped by unfair foreign competition,they naturally desired to be reassured and to be guaranteedagainst dumping.,    The second point for the Committee was,therefore,  he thought, that they should investigate theproposals put forward by the President  of the Board of Tradeagainst dumping..    His third proposition related to theDominions.    Very few of those who had spoken that  day hadreferred to our trade with the Dominions.    He hoped thatthis meant that they were all agreed on the subject.   TheDominion Premiers,  during their recent visits, had notevinced any special keenness in regard to Imperial &quot;refer-er.ee, but they were all very anxious that tho commodities oftheir countries should: be brought to our markets withoutthe cost being increased to such an extent as would renderthem subject to close competition vis-a-vis, the United StatesOf America.    In 1907 ho himself had definitely proposedthat we should make shipping arrangements in order to getfrom the Dominions  raw material,  food,  copper,  lead, and allthings which were of prime necessity and essential to ourkey industries and national life;    that  is to say, to securethat the carriage of such commodities should be achieved ata low cost.    He thought,  therefore, that the Governmentwould be justified in saying to Parliament that this wasnot an economic question but a political question.    Thevarious nations of the Empire had supported us during the
la at 3a:, and possible had madjafud^defeat  and victory.    &quot;&quot;ho could say what  our Army and Navymight cos-&quot;  in tho future?    But supposing that we devoted oneor two millions to cheapening our oormauni cat ions with theDominions,  it world be a form of insurance, as it would enableus to count  confidently on military assistance from ourDominions  in tho future,&apos; and also enable us to reduce our ownarmed forces accordingly.    lie would like to be able to say tothe dominions,-&quot;If you will give us pound for pound, wo willdo the same&quot;.    This was what the Dominions themselves urged.He would lime the Committee to examine this question, and hehoped that the Cabinet would give him authority to announceto Parliament that that vras our policy.The President of the Board of fducation asked whetherthis was to apply to India as well.The Prime minister said that certain Shipping Companieswere chargine more to carry British officials to India thanto China, which was twice the distance,  because there was nocompetition,    he thought, therefore,  that it was only rightto take measures to ensure fair-play for the dominions andIndia .A further pledge the Government had given to thecountry was that we would develop our agriculture.    Our futureturned laeaely upon our power to turn back the present flowfrom the country to the t owns $  and divert the stream back tothe country districts..    When Sir Robert Peel had got rid ofthe Corn laws he had., unfortunately,  neve:&apos;&apos; proposed anyalternative agricultural policy.    The sooner we took a boldline the better, and he wished to have authority to say thatwe mean to face this question eoldly and to place our agri-culture on a proper footing, by transport (at non-economica1rates,  for the time being,  if necessary), by housing, and bythe readjustment of railwav rates (which -Today favouredforeign agriculture).    Before leaving this subject,  there
was *me fact he wished tc state.

    The Prime Minister said that he was astounded to find how great was the strength of feeling amongst the people generally and in the business world in particular that the Government should closely investigate our financial position.

    The Secretary of State for War said that the General Staff at the War Office were preparing a statement of the questions concerning the post-war Army in which large expenditure was involved and upon which a Cabinet decision was necessary. There were, in addition, a considerable number of immediate questions of policy which had to be decided upon, for example, the number of men we were retaining in France, and the number of men who were looking after the material which we still had in that country; and in particular the question of whether it would not be a saving to leave the salvage work in France and to bring home and demobilise the men who were engaged upon it. Mr. Churchill promised to do his best to let the Prime Minister have a statement on these immediate questions by the following Monday.
