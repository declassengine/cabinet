The Germans were therefore in militarycontrol of the port.     Fehad allowed them to remain
there as a force against the Bolshevists. They had frequently begged for help but we had not given it to them.

MR. BONAR LAW asked if the two wireless messages were the only information we had received.

THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF THE NAVAL STAFF replied that it was.

THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF said it was true that we had allowed Von der Goltz  to remain at Libau, but now that he had embarked guns and acted as reported we should, if necessary, cut him off from his base and sink his ships.

THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that we had been supporting the Germans against the Bolshevists but now that the former had turned their guns against the Letts the situation was altered. Under cover of our protection the Germans, had turned their guns on our friends.

MR. BONAR LAW asked if it was possible that the Lettish Government had become Bolshevists.

THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF THE NAVAL STAFF said that he did not think so. There were, he added, two parties in the Lettish Government, just as there were two parties in Ireland.  He thought that the Germans were attempting to overthrow the Lettish party.

MR. BONAR LAW asked what action we could take, seeing that there were 25,000 German troops at the port.

THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF replied that we could not take action with men but that we could cut the German force off from their base.
