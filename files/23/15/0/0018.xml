I G R 1-- T  . WAR CABINET 535 B.DRAFT MINUTES of a Meeting held at 10, Downing Street,S.W., on FRIDAY, JUNE 27th, 1919, at 12 Noon.\(---------SITU-     (1) lord Gurzon reminded the War Cabinet that, when they hadW IN3IA.    last reviewed the situation in Russia on June 18th, 1919 (WarCabinet 580A), it had been decided to discuss the question- again on June 27, in the light of the situation on the variousfronts on that date, and to ask the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff to be present on that occasion; and that, in themeantime, while General Ironside should, go forward with his pLansfor the operations as previously agreed upon by the War Cabinet,he should, not undertake a definite advance until the War Cabinethad finally decided upon the course of action.    It was in accord-ance with the above decision that the War Cabinet had met thatmorning, in order to consider further the projected advance ofGeneral Ironside&apos;s troops to Kotlas.     When the question had lastbeen discussed by the Cabinet the majority of those present hadbeen in favour of the proposed operations, on the grounds thatthey might enable General Ironside from the Forth to link upwith Admiral Kolohak&apos;s forces in the South.     The War Office,however, advocated the scheme on its own merits, as necessaryto cover the withdrawal of our troops from North Russia.   Si neethe 18th instant, a number of telegrams dealing with the situationIn North Russia had been circulated and the War Cabinet were metthat day in order to decide definitely whether or not sanctionshould be ahcorded to the proposed operation.    He thereforeinvited the Secretary of State for ?/ar to make a statement.The Secretary of State for War said that the question fordecision was rather military than political in its character.   Hewould therefore suggest that the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff should explain to those present why, in the existingcircumstances, the General Staff regarded this operation asnecessary.
The Chief of the Imperial General taff said that originally the object of the operation was twofold; (I) to link up General Ironside&apos;s troops with General Gaida, who was on the right of Admiral Kolchak&apos;s army; and (ii) to strike the Bolsheviks a heavy blow in order to allow us to withdraw our troops in good order. Some months ago, when the Government had decided that British troops should be taken away from North Russia, he had gone very carefully into the question, and had come to the conclusion that a retirement with tired troops would be a most difficult operation and might contain the seeds of a serious disaster. Steps had therefore been taken to form two British Brigades, composed of selected men, admirably equipped, under excellent officers, whose duty it would be to cover the retirement. These two Brigades amounted, in all, to 7,000 or 8,000 men of all ranks. In the meantime Admiral Kolchak had started thrusting forward his right towards Glasovo, and it had appeared possible, if good fortune attended his advance, that he might effect a junction with our troops. Admiral Kolchak&apos;s Success, however, was short-lived, and he was compelled to fall back first in the south, then in the centre, and then in the North. Today the chances of a junction appeared very remote. It was necessary, however, to consider the Russian temperement, which was very mercurial. Quite recently Admiral Kolchak had had to fall back some 300 miles. In the South, however, General Denekin, who three months back had been in a very perilous position on the Don, was today in possession of Tzaritain, and it appeared likely that he would very shortly capture Astrakhan and obtain control of the Black Sea.

Lord Curzon enquired whether General Denekin&apos;s successes might not be due to the fact that he was being well supplied by us with munitions of War.

The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that we were equally supplying Admiral Kolchak. Regarding the present question as a military problem, his view would be that if the troops engaged

  


 were from Western Europe and not Russians, there was not much likelihood of the advance enabling us to link up with Admiral Kolchak&apos;s troops. With the Russian temperament, however, anything was possible, and he did not, therefore, give up all hope of being able to effect a junction. Our second object in carrying out this operation was to cover the withdrawal of out men from North Russia. To disengage our entire troops in the face of pursuing Bolsheviks, from a forward position some 120 miles from Archangel, was a very difficult operation. The fact that Admiral Kolchak had been compelled to retire made it all the more necessary for us to advance and strike our blow. The further General Gaida had to fall back, and the less chance there consequently would be of our joining hands with him, the more important it was for us to reach Kotlas in order that we might obtain possession, of the river steamers, wharves and stores, and destroy them. As soon as we were in possession of  Kotlas it was our intention ourselves to retire in good order and to leave the Russian troops who were co-operating with us well-established at or near that place. After giving every aspect of the case his most careful consideration, he strongly advised the Cabinet to permit the operation to proceed.

Lord Curzon said there were three hypotheses before the cabinet. The first was that General Ironside would reach Kotlas and effect a junction with Admiral Kolchak. This, in present circumstances, seemed unlikely. Secondly, that he would get to Kotlan and would be unable to join hands with General Gaida. He would, however, be able to destroy the wharves of that place and the flotilla of steamers, now in the hands of the Bolsheviks. Thirdly, that he would not reach Kotlas, which he thought presented a somewhat alarming prospect. He would like to ask the chief of the Imperial General staff two questions :-

(i) If our troops reached Kotlas and were unable to join up with Admiral Kolchak but succeeded in destroying the flotilla and the wharves, what would be our position, and to what extent would /



 


our prestige &quot;be effected:If we foiled to reach Kotlas, would not ourposition he very serious, and should we nothe faced   with probable disaster.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said he did notmean to  suggest that we should not be able to reach Kotlas.He would be surprised if we did not.     The Bolshevistopposing forces might snake one stand against our troops,but  it was not likely that they would face them a secondtime.      It was quite true that if we failed to reach Kotlasand had to withdraw, our position would be grave.     Hecould not say what effect upon the friendly Russian troopsco-operating with us our failure might have.      It wascertain that our retreat from North Bussia whether before orafter advancing might ruin the Archangel Government.     &quot;From.that possibility there was no escape.      In his view, however,our best chance of getting out of Russia with credit andof being able to leave Archangel with a Government more orless securely established, was to undertake this operation.In reply to a question, General Wilson said that GeneralIronside expected to reach Kotlas in about fifteen daysfrom the time he started.     He was ready to start at anymoment,  that is to say,  a day or so after receiving the  -sanction of His Majesty*s Government to the project.In reply to a further question General Wilson said thatthe Admiralty thought it would not be safe for us to post-pone the evacuation of Archangel to a later date&apos; than thethird week in October, when it was possible that the seamight be frozen over.The first Sea Lord,  in reply to a suggestion that theperiod might be prolonged for a month by the use of iceLord Ourzon said that if that were the case, and supposingthat Kotlas were captured &quot;by about July 16,  there would remainbreakers,  said that was not a very agreeable prespedt tocontemplate.
of our troops,   lie enquired as? to the number of Allied troopswhich would be taking part in the operation.The Chief of the imperial General Staff said that the forceconsisted oft-IS,000 British (including the two picked Brigadesalready referred to)100 French30 Italians (who, however, wore on the pointof being shipped back to theirown country).22,000 -Russians,in regard to the latter, General Ironside had expressed hlm-self as generally satisfied and he had spoken of using them inthe front lino.   The force would, consist of the followinguni ts ? -1 picked Britten brigade in front, and a secondin reserve,1 mixed British and f-erbian Brigade,The Russian Brigades, tin eh contained a certainnumber of British Officers andnon- c o ami sei one d. o     leers.Opposed to the above there were, according to the latestIntelligence, some 33,700 Bolshevist troops *   This, however,was a rough estimate, and the actual force might -number3,00&apos;), either more or less.   Their fighting, value was quee-tlonable, and General Ironside was much less afraid of meetingwith determined resistance than of striking a blow in theair.    In regard to guns, the opposing, forces were about   .equal,   fe had, however, our river flotilla, and wo alsohad, either present on the spot or shortly reaching forth.Russia, three Squadrons of aeroplanes, in which arm the enemywere entirely deficient.   General ironside proposed to send
 forward part of his force by rail and part by river.

Lord Curzon said that supposing (a) we reached Kotlas in fifteen days, (b) that we did not link up with Admiral Koltchak and (c) that we succeeded in destroying the enemy flotilla and wharves of the city and supposing the enemy then collected in considerable strength and descended upon us, was there any chance, in the view of the General Staff, of a disaster befalling General Ironside?

The Chief of the Imperial General Staff replied that he thought the chances of disaster were small. We had two excellent brigades under General Ironside&apos;s Commans. The enemy could only advance by water, and we could certainly render their progress very difficult by mining the river. We ourselves had found it difficult to operate far from the river bank, and the enemy would find it much more so if we destroyed their steamers and mined the stream.

Lord Curzon enquired if, when the time came for us to withdraw, we were still under an obligation to take away friendly Russians in and about Archangel, whose numbers were estimated at about 15,000 to 16,000 (War Cabinet 552, Min. 3). Assuming that the projected operation was fairly successful, would this obligation still remain.

The Chief of the Imperial General Staff maid that would depend very much on whether or not the North Russian Government would be in a position to look after them.




The Secretary of State for far said that the growth ofthe Russian arwiy in this area during the last five monthsappeared to htm to he remarkable.   The Russian forces co-operating with us now amounted to some 32,000 men whosefighting value as compared with the best European troops wightnet be very great,   he had reason to believe, however, thatthe material was quite good.   In addition to- the two pickedhrttiah Brigades and the purely Pmssian units there was theSlavo-British Brigade composed of Russians with a considerableportion of British Officers *   There was therefore in forthRussia what was rapidly developing into a very usefuland self-sufficient Busalan force.   The far Cabinet hadrecently given him permission to collect and train some1800 Buss Ian Officers in England who i?wM he sent outto Month Ruisia as roon as their training was sufficientlyadvanced,   he had, therefore, reason to hope that when wewithdrew in October we would leave behind us at Archangelan established Russian Government supported by an artsy whichshould be quite capable of defending Itself from such attacksas might be expected in so out-of-the-way place.    It waa,however, unlikely that the Bolshevists would concentrateagainst, Archangel in any considerable force *   Their attentionwould be mainly directed between Kolohak and r enlkin ana theoperations which were taking place around Petrograd.   Hethought It waa reasonable therefore, taking Into considerationboth the military end political aspects of the problem,, thatwhen we retired the Russian Government would he able to offeradequate protection to the 16,000 friendly Inhabitants re-ferred to by Lord Cur enj in other words that, on withdrawing,we should
 Leave matters in such a posture that no discredit would attach to us. In reply to a question by Lord Curzon Mr. Churchill said, that the Tschalkosky Government at Archangel was the most democratic of all the three separate Governments that we were supporting. This Government was at present dependent upon us and would no doubt be very much upset at our going, but they know that our decision to withdraw was irrevocable. The Bolschevist Government itself, however, was far from stable and its forces not in any way reliable. The wars, in fact, that were taking place in different parts of Russia were on both sides wars of the weak. Proceeding, Mr Churchill said that as to our future policy he thought it would be a great mistake for us to break our political necks for Russia by maintaining indefinitely a kind of equipoise warfare. He was, in full agreement with the Prime Minister that next year our policy generally would require re-consideration. He himself did not believe in an early collapse of the Bolshevists power; but he did hope that the Anti-Bolshevist armies would be self-supporting in 1920. His aim was successfully to disentangle and withdraw our troops from North Russia and to wind up affairs there in such a way that when we went no dishonour could attach to us. Our policy, however, could only be successful, in his view, if our military Advisers were allowed to carry out their carefully made plans for the withdrawal of our troops. He thought that the Chief of the Imperial General Staff had been rightly cautious in his statement and had guarded himself






at every point. General Wilson had complete faith in Ironside, who was confident that he could not be out off, that the proposed operation would be successful, and that he would not have difficulty in withdrawing at any time. General Ironside plans had the full approval of the General Staff who strongly recommended they should be adopted.

Lord Curzon referred to certain regrettable incidents which had recently taken place at Murmansk and asked whether the War Office had any reason to apprehend similar trouble at Archangel.

The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said, that the War Office saw no reason to fear anything of this kind. Our troops at Murmansk were thoroughly tired, and disheartened at not having been demobilised; General Ironside&apos;s on the other hand contained two picked Brigades composed of men who were all volunteers and in excellent heart.

The President of the Board of Education said, that when the present project was first submitted to the War Cabinet, one of the leading arguments in its favour was that, if successful, it would enable Admiral Kolchak to base himself upon Archangel and it would secure for us a safe and honourable retreat from that port. He understood that the river Dwina was the only line of advance and retreat in that area.  He inquired, therefore, whether we could not completely secure our position and our withdrawal by mining the river.

The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said, there was a great deal to be said for that point of view; but if Mr. Fisher&apos;s suggesstion were adopted it would mean that we must relinquish all possibility of joining up


with General Geida, and Archangel and the Tschaikosky Government would be placed in a very unhappy position.

The Secretary of State for War pointed out that in order to secure command of the river we must first capture the enemy&apos;s steamers; and to do this, a forward move was necessary. Moreover, if this operation were successful it was quite possible that the numbers of the Russian forces with General Ironside might swell from 22,000 to 35,000 or even more before the ice sets in. It was incumbent upon us to give the Archangel Government the best possible chance of maintaining itself through the Winter. He did not think that we could possibly slink out of the county and leave nothing between that Government and the Bolshevist forces but a few mines in the river. Our credit, which to-day stood very high throughout Russia was at stake. All the civilised forces in that country realised that we alone (with the doubtful exception of the Japanese), had really befriended and assisted them; and if we turned round now and cleared off our reputation would suffer irretrievably.

    


 The Chancellor of the Exchequer inquired as to the nature and extent of the population in Kotlas and between our troops in North Russia and that town; and, supposing we advanced, and our blow fell in the air, should we be under any obligation to remove that population as well as the 15,000 inhabitants referred to by Lord Curzon.

The Chief of the Imperial General Staff replied that he could not say that there would be any such obligation. The inhabitants were fully aware that in any case we meant to withdraw before the ice set in.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer inquired further if our troops advanced and the Bolshevik forces offered resistance, and we obtained a complete success short of linking up with General Gaida would, in that case, the army of the Archangel Government be able to resist Bolshevik attacks after our departure?

The Chief of the Imperial General Staff replied that if we deserted the Bolshevik Army and mined the river the army of the Archangel Government should have a very good chance of standing up against the Bolsheviks. They should, at all events, feel fairly safe for the next six months. In reply to a question by Mr. Fisher, General Wilson said that if we captured Kotlas the Russian troops co-operating with us would be established in that town.

Sir Eric Geddes, referring to a suggestion made earlier by Mr. Fisher, reminded the Cabinet that mines could only be a temporary expedient.

The First Sea Lord confirmed this and stated that it was only a question of time before they could be swept up or destroyed.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that if the question before them were merely a civil or political question he would not be in favour of the projected operation as he thought it was of too risky a nature. He did not share the optimistic views that had been expressed about the soldierly qualities of the Russian troops who would be fighting with us, or about the capacity of the Archangel Government.




He was further greatly impressed by the statement of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff that the operation was necessary from the military point of view to ensure the safe withdrawal of our troops.

The Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of Labour, in reply to a question by Lord Curzon, said that the feeling in Labour circles generally was very strong about our intervention in Russia. The moderate section of the Labour Party was acting its best to restrain the more ardent spirits, but it was doubtful whether they would be able to resist them for a longer period than the next few weeks. Our policy in Russia had been extensively canvassed at the Labour Conference now being held at Southport, and it was evident that a considerable majority of those attending the Conference were in favour of forcing the hand of the Government. It appeared likely that the Triple Alliance proposed shortly to declare a general strike with a view to compelling the Government to withdraw at once all our troops in Russia and to refrain in future from all interference in the affairs of that country.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he understood that the threatened strike would be a protest against (a) our intervention in Russia and the assistance we were giving to what Labour regarded as reactionary Governments. i.e., Kolchak and Denikin; (b) conscription; (c) retention of conscientious objectors in prison, and (d) the application of income tax to the labouring classes.

The Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of Labour said that the principal factor of the agitation was undoubtedly our intervention in Russia. Practically the whole of the most influential Labour newspapers declared that here was a chance at any rate of establishing a successful Government in Russia on Soviet lines, and


    the main obstacle in its way was the policy adopted by the British Government. He himself had been surprised at the extent to which men of all classes were now coming round to supporting the Labour view that the Soviet Government ought to be given a fair chance. A further point was that we had never attempted to interfere when the Czar was in power. There was no doubt that this feeling was spreading and he was afraid that the agitation might assume formidable proportions.

  The Secretary of State for War said he was quite prepared to defend our policy in Parliament. The evacuation of our troops in every part of Russia from Archangel to the Caucasus was proceeding day by day and the line he would take in the House of Commons was that we were in fact withdrawing our troops and that the present operation was only designed to cover the safe and complete evacuation of our forces in the north.

   The Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of Labour warned the War Cabinet that there was bound to be trouble if early in September at or about the Meeting of the Trade Union Congress a casualty list were published of British soldiers killed in Russia while fighting to suppress a Soviet Government.

  Lord Curzon agreed with the Secretary of State for War that, if necessary, a very strong case could be made in Parliament in defence of the policy of the Government.

  The Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of Labour regretted the fact that at present time there was no Labour Member of standing, of the calibre for example of Mr. A. Henderson and Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, who could take the responsibility of replying to the Government case in the House.

The Chief of the Imperial General Staff suggested that what was necessary was careful and well-conducted propaganda to state the true facts and explain the

 


 Government policy to the working man of the country.

   The First Lord of the Admiralty agreed that this was very desirable and said that he thought it was unfortunate that little or no action so far had been taken to justify to the country the policy of the Government.

   The Secretary of State for War said that if he thought that the proposed operations in North Russia were likely to culminate in a really big battle with heavy casualties, he would take a different line. He himself, however, doubted whether the Bolshevists would offer any really serious resistance. In another part of Russia General Maynard with indifferent troops and an armoured train or two, and with the aid of plenty of bluff, had on more than one occasion defeated the Bolsheviks with hardly a casualty at all. All experience went to show that the Bolsheviks had never been able to screw up enough courage to offer any prolonged resistance. General Denekin again and again had defeated them with odds against him of 10 to 1. His own feeling was that the Bolsheviks in the present instance would not put up much of a fight.


The Chief of the Imperial General Staff pointed out to the War Cabinet that the alternative to the proposed operations -- that is to say, any attempt to withdraw without first striking a blow -- was such more dangerous.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that this argument had convinced him that the War Cabinet should sanction the operation.

Lord Curzon thought that the propaganda suggested by General Wilson might be making too much of what was, after all, a comparatively insignificant movement.

The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said the propaganda he had in mind was designed to explain our whole policy in every part of Russia, and not this particular item in it.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought that much valuable propaganda might be conducted through the medium of the Sunday newspapers.

The Secretary of State for War said that there would be no difficulty at all in defending the Government policy, which was, to withdraw our troops from all theatres of war in Russia.

The War Cabinet decided --

To sanction General Ironside&apos;s proposed operations, on the conditions laid down.

???

(2) The First Lord of the Admiralty asked that the consideration of the Admiralty Memorandum on the situation in the Baltic (Paper G.T.-7513), which was down on the Agenda Paper for discussion that morning, might be deferred for a few days. Another Memorandum on the general situation in Eastern Prussia and Poland was in course of preparation in the Admiralty, and he hoped it would be ready for circulation to members of the War Cabinet on the following Monday.

The Secretary of Stats for War said that the Germans were
playing a very astute game on the Polish frontier, and it seemed that we had no power at present to make the decisions of the Peace Conference operative in that area.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer enquired what powers Marshal Foch had to restrain the aggressive activities of the German Army on the Polish frontier.

The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that a week previously the Heads of the three Allied Governments had instructed Marshal Foch to order General von der Goltz to stop his operations. Unfortunately, these instructions had been held up for some days in M. Clemenceau&apos;s office. This was the third time that such instructions had been issued to General von der Goltz, who had not paid the slightest attention to them. All Marshal Foch could do, to bring pressure to bear on the German Government, was to advance on the Rhine.

He himself had urged, in Paris, that pressure should be brought to bear on the enemy before the conclusion of the Armistice. In reply to a question, General Wilson said that he was informed that Peace could not be ratified before July 21, until which date the Armistice would continue in existence. The ratification on our side would have to be made by the Heads of three First Class Powers.

The War Cabinet took note of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff&apos;s statement.
