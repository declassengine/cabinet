S -Von TUESDAYs  AUGUST 5,   1919,  at  11-30 a .33. &apos;   &quot;POLICY       (1) The Prime Minister said that he thought the time-GOVERN-come when the Government should review the whole positionof the country after the conclusion of Peace, with a viewto deciding whether there was anything that the Governmentcould do, and, if so, what, and how and when it could be done.There would be no doubt in the minds of many that there werecertain things that no Government could do.    On the otherhand, there were many things which the Government ought andwas expected to do.    Ee would like these problems, afterconsideration, to be divided into two categories, and thesooner the country was made acquainted with the Government&apos;spolicy the better.    Even If the Government showed that theywanted to do things which it Eight afterwards be found couldnot be done, the attempt would create a spirit of confidencewhich would eo fa- to attain good results,    lie would ask hiscolleagues to take note of the matters on which he was goingto speak, and to form an opinion upon them.    He himself hadnot come to a conclusion on many of the problems, but desiredthe views of hie colleagues in order that the Governmentmight come to a definite decision.   He had provisional viewson certain subjects.   When be was in Paris he could not pre-tend to be able to concentrate his mind on the great problemswhich were worrying his colleagues in this country.    Sincehe had returned, however, he had devoted a good deal ofattention to them.    The outlook was full of anxieties, and
not free from perils.    The v7ar had made a great change inour position.    Before the Tar we were a creditor nation, andnow we were a debtor nation.    That was a great change in acommercial oeonle like ourselves.    This position wasrefleci-ed in our imports and exports.    Before the Tar, although thebalance of imports was against us, it did not matter, as thedifference was paid for by what were called our &quot;invisible&quot;exports,   such as freights,  interest, insurance,  commissions,etc.    The country had also been in a position to invest 200,000,000 or  300,000,000 a year.    All that was nowchanged, and the gap between imports and exports was a veryconsiderable one.    The interest from our investments abroadhad also been reduced to a figure of  100,000,000 or so.Mr Bonar Lav; said that he doubted whether the countrycould,  strictly speaking,, be regarded as a debtor nation.&quot;he Prime Minister said that he feared, such was thecase, as we were purchasing more than we were paying for,were increasing our expenditure, and were living on capital.If everyone in this country did their best, he wouldhave no anxiety that we should pull through.    But there wassomething wrong;    there was something preventing the countryfrom &quot;putting forth its best energies, as it did during theTar.    This took two forms:    the first of them  - strikes  was serious, but not so serious as the second.    As for theconstant Labour disputes, as soon as one was settled the menwanted something else.   At the present moment there were twoor three strikes in progress, all of which, before the War,would have been considered serious enough for Cabinet dis-cussion.    In the offing there was the prospect of troublewith the transport workers, as well as with the miners.But there was something more serious than strikes, and thatwas diminution of output.    The men were not working well.This observation applied not  only to the miners, but to thebuilding and other trades.    This diminution of output wasprevalent at a time when the country ought to get increased-a-
output in order to meet the demands made upon it.    This was aserious position, which had to be looted into;    and unless aremedy was found, he would not say the country would end inbankruptcy, but it would be unable to make both ends meetand would lose its credit ahroada    The French were insolvent,and they were not attempting to make both ends meet.    But theFrench were mainly an agricultural people, and were not asdependent as this country on their credit abroad.The Postmaster-General interposed that the French werewording harder than the English, and gave an instance of aFrench industry the machinery of which started at 5 a.m. onMonday and never ceased till 5 a,m. on the following Sunday;whereas at Bradford, although the men wished to work hard,they were prevented from doing so by their Union leaders.The Prime Minister, continuing, said that the UnitedStates were also working hard, and he had seen some remarkablefigures regarding their output.    If we were the only countrythat did not put our shoulders to the wheel we should fallbehind in the race.    It was the duty of the Government, as thetrustees of the nation, to investigate thls^roblem and endeav-our to put matters right,,   Various suggestions for the solu-tion of this problem had been made to him, and he would likehis colleagues to take note of them and give him their views.The first remedy did not involve legislation, and it was thatwe should use propaganda among the working-classes.   Therewas a good deal of counter propaganda goin? on at the presentmoment, which, although it taught false political economy,was very clever;    otherwise the people, who had common sense,would not believe it.    For example, there was most dangerouspropaganda teaching diminution of output, which it was claimedwould be an advantage to the working-classes.    ResponsibleLabour leaders had told him that there was in existence aformidable body of young men whose aim was to destroy thepresent industrial and Parliamentary systems, whose methodto accomplish this end was diminution of output9 and who wouldthen take the reins of Government.   These young men had a
definite philosophy.    They accepted the doctrine of elates 1Jlgovernment, admitted that there had always been governmentby oligarchy, aristocracy, and the middle class.    Theyrejected democracy, and advocated government by the Indus-trial workers.   When they were urged to capture- the-politicalmachine they answered that they did not understand it, thatit did not belong to them but to the governing classes, whocould use it with much more skill than the workers.    Theirswas an economic weapon.Further1, the working man said to himself that therewere endless difficulties in getting on with any socialimprovement   little interests everywhere, rules,regulations^etc. - and there was an instinct which said they must outright through all these obstacles.    This was Soviet govern-mento    Cromwell had the same ideas in his conflict with SirParry Vane, and one found exactly the same apirit inspeeches as in the appeals of the Bolsheviks, where thefutility of talk was contrasted with the value of action.It was the duty of the Government to demonstrate to theworxing-classes the folly of such doctrines.    No-one wasdoing this now.    In the old days every Member of Parliamentworked hard in his constituency and promulgated his views inthe newspapers.    The only people now who used the Press werethe Bolsheviks, and they held meetings on Sundays whichwere attended by thousands, spreading their views.    Theyalso had captured the Trade Union organisation.    The questionwas, what steps should be taken to counter this propaganda-It must he made clear to the workmen that there was nosubstance in the views held by these extremists, nor in theview that Parliament would not redress their grievances.    Inaddition,  it should be made clear that any disorder would besternly repressed, and also all impossible and unjust demandsAlready,  in the case of the present Yorkshire dispute, thePress were asking Mh&quot;hy did the Government not settle this?&quot;If we were convinced that the demands were unjust,  it wouldbe fatal to the Government to settle the dispute on the men&apos;s-4-

This was Soviet govern-ment.    Cromwell had the same ideas in his conflict with SirParry Vane, and one found exactly the same spirit inspeeches as in the appeals of the Bolsheviks, where thefutility of talk was contrasted with the value of action.It was the duty of the Government to demonstrate to theworKing-classes the folly of such doctrines.

Inaddition,  it should be made clear that any disorder would besternly repressed, and also all impossible and unjust demandsAlready, in the case of the present Yorkshire dispute, thePress were asking  &quot;Thy did the Government not settle this?1&quot;If we were convinced that the demands were unjust,  it wouldbe fatal to the Government to settle the dispute on the men&apos;s-4-
terms.    There, again, it should be made clear that the -Government wa3 fighting because it had come to a pointwhere it was impossible to make further concessions withoutirreparable  injury to the State.    Put cere resistance todemands was not enough, and all legislative grievances mustbe  removed.v?ith regard to the question of wages, he thought that,in the main, the demands of the working-classes had beensatisfactorily met, and he thought the working-classes wereof this opinion themeelves. However, the question might belooked into in order to discover if anything more could bedone .The first question on which the Government ought totake action, and where a genuine grievance existed, was thatof profiteering.    The feeling on this subject was universal.He heard of it everywhere, and it was a real  ground of dis-co.nte.nt.    This agitation was receiving the support of theprofessional classes and the people with small incomes:    theywere behind the working-clas3.    He had heard army officerstalk wild. Bolshevism on the subject of profiteering;   whenthese men returned to civil life they were made to payenormous prices for everything.    Profiteering was weldingthese classes together in one common, persistence against thisstate of things, which undoubtedly constituted a great dangerto the State.    He had asked the Chancellor of the Exchequerto go into the question of whether anything could be doneregarding past profiteering.   Profiteering both in the $hole-sale and retail business should be the subject of immediateinvestigation.   There was no doubt that the country wassuffering from a reaction from the spirit of self-sacrificewhich had been exercised during the War.    Everyone was outfor profit.    Pre-war profits, which were regarded as legiti-mate and reasonable, were now locked upon as trivial.   Ke wasasked to see a gentleman a few days ago who was interested inan. industry which claimed special privileges froar the State.This gentleman had said that the trouble with his trade was
that there was too much pro-fit attached to It.   Men in thetrade who were inefficient were making enormous profits, andthis placed, a premium on inefficiency.    It was doing moreharm than anything else among the workmen.   The profits inthis particular trade, he said, were a scandal.    The PrimeMinister said there was no reason why he should not informthe Caoinet of the trade which this gentleman represented:it was the iron and steel trade, which was supposed to belanguishing.    But the same thing applied everywhere: drapers,grocers, everyone was trebling his profits.    The making ofmoney had become a erase,  like an alcoholic craving,, whichcould not be resisted.    But it had got to be stopped.    Theworking-classes would not tolerate it, and, in his opinion,it was at tho bottom of the trouble in this country more thanany other individual -cause.    Ke &quot;would be anxious if Parl.la-roe nt separated and the Govo.rr.ment was faced, with ruling thiscountry for three or four months without any powers for deal-ing with the profiteers.    He would like the Lord Chancellorto look into the question of whether It was possible to usethe powers of the Defence of the Realm Act in this connection.The Lord Chancellor said that he feared no generalpowers existed.    There were only specific powers taken by thePood Controller under the Defence of the Realm Act.The President of the Board of Education said that aparticular case of profiteering had come to his notice, wherea small village retailer had been able to buy an estate of600 acres out of profits mads during the War.The Prime Minister,  continuing,  said there was anothersubject which was creating bad feeling in the country, andthat was housing.    It was not that the houses were bad, butthe fact that houses were absolutely unobtainable.    Here,&apos;again, this question was federating the lower-middle classeswith the working-classes in the general discontent.    So farthe people had seen nothing done.   They saw Housing Bills,but&apos; every Government had Housing Dills.    That they wantedwas to see the houses actually being built.    In a certain
quarter in the Bast of London, where it was practically^-impossible to find any accommodation at all, there werefour empty public-houses.   He thought, for example, somethingmight be done with these, and with similar unoccupied pre-mises .The Minister of Health said that the Government hadno power, until last week, to seize public-houses.The Prime Minister, continuing, said that all thepublic saw was hindrances and difficulties, but no houses.Later on he would want to have the views of the Ministerof Health on this question.[kalisa- The Prime Minister said that he now came to the mostof theIndustry difficult subject, i.e., that of nationalisation.    The Gov-ernment was confronted with an immediate decision, and hewas going to ash for the views of his colleagues as to whet liethis immediate decision should be given, or whether the ques-tioh should be postponed.    He thought there was nothing moreto be said with regard to miners&apos; wages and hours,  although,if his colleagues had any views with regard to the Yorkshiredispute, he would like to hear them.    The red! question tobe settled was that of management and control.    Were themines to be worked for private profit, and were the minersto have a voice in the control?    These two questions were notnecessarily identical, and he would therefore like the Cab-inet to treat them separately.    Por himself, he was not, atthe moment, going to express an opinion, but only state theproblem.    There were, broadly speaking, three possiblecourses, and he would like the Cabinet to confine themselvesto these broad propositions, rather than to go into details.The first was whether there should be complete nationalisa-tion of the mines, with a Minister of Mines,  as suggested byMr Justice Sankey.    The second proposition was what he wouldcall the Port of London scheme, by which would bo set up aManagement Board which would represent the producer, theworker and the consumer.    This would be a sort of conglomer-ate Board, which would manage the mines district by district.
This was really nationalisation,  for it entailed buying outthe owners.    The third proposition involved the national isa-tion of minerals.    This was common to all the schemes andrecommendations which had been put forward, and all agreedthat minerals should be nationalised.    He would, therefore,take it that the Tar Cabinet agreed on this common ground.The nationalisation of minerals would be coupled with a pro-cess of amalgamation of mining interests.    The^e were two orthree schemes which had been put forward for effecting this,by 51- Arthur Puckham, by Lord Gainford, and Sir ThomasRat cliffe-Ellis, and they all contained an element of repre-sentation for the miners and consumers.    On this question hewould put forward a suggestion, that if minerals were to benationalised it would be a serious thing to compensate theowners of the land without  reference to the social obliga-tions towards the community vrtiich raised the minerals.    InScotland minerals were liable to rates, etc., for betterhousing, health,  etc., and if the owners were compensatedfor the full value of the minerals and there was no obliga-tion on them for improving the conditions of the workmen, it-would be a ground for strong and legitimate protest.   Theremust b* a levy on the amount of compensation paid for thesepurposes.    He would like to apply to England the Scottishprinciple, although he would not express an opinion as towhether that principle should be extended.   He would suggestthat, say, 10 per cent, of the compensation paid to theowners should be set aside for improving conditions;   andthis was all the more necessary as the surface would stillremain in the owners&apos; hands and would be improved.    He putthis forward as a definite suggestion for the considerationof his colleagues,^culture. ThePrice Minister said that he now came to anotherquestion, the problem of rural regeneration.   There was nodoubt that one of the dangers of British social and economicorganisation was that it was too one-sided.    In France and
Germany the agricultural population waa a solid foundationfor the State, and,in the event of trouble, could always berelied unon.    It was impossible to develop the agricultureof this country by leaving it to itself.    This might coneaiv-ably be possible in 30 or 40 years&apos; time, but not in presentconditions.    The State was bound to assist.   For a consider-able number of years men had been attracted from rural dis-triots into the towns, and now there was no reserve uponwhich to draw.    The process could be seen very clearly inWales, where the nation&apos;s energies had been diverted intomines and quarries.    The task that lay before the Governmenttoday was that of re-constructing the nerves and tissues ofthe ration, and re-vitalising the:: for generations to come.This task he wished the War Cabinet to think out in ail itsaenscts, with t^e will and determination to accomplish itsuccessfully.   There was the question of Housing;    evenbefore the War the rural landlord could not undertake it,and he was in a more unfavourable position today.    There wasthe question of Transoort, which was vital, and perhaps thekey to national prosperity,    What was required was to bringback the people into the agricultural districts.    This wouldnot be an easy business, as the country in the winter was nota very joyous place, and offered few attractions.    It must,therefore, be made worth the while of the population to goback to agricultural life.    Then it would be necessary totrain them for that life.There was, further, the problem of expenditure.   Wewere faced today with diminished resources, and the loss,owing to the War, of a great part of the young manhood ofthe nation.    The number of our ships had been ghreatlylessened, and there had been a serious falling off in ouroutput generally.    It looked as if our normal expenditurewouia be four times what it was before the Wart and allthis expenditure was not re-productive.   We could not affordto go on as we were doing, and it was necessary for us torealise that we could not have the best of everything.
The Government must be prepared to take risks just as thesoldier had to take risks;    and they must  decide what  risksthey could best afford to take.   As regards our Naval andMilitary position, our Armies had destroyed the only enemywe had in Europe;    his military force was now reduced to10n,000 men;    and his Navy&quot;was at the bottom of Gcapa Flow.If,  therefore,  in such circumstances, we maintained a largerArmy and Navy and Air Force than we had before we entered onthe Tar,  people would say,  either that the Tar had been afailure,  or that we were making provision to fight an imagin-ary foe.    .?hat the Tar Cabinet had to decide was not a matterof Naval or Military policy, but rather a question of foreignpolicy,  of statecraft.    That is, what provision in respect ofour armed forces we must make for,  say,  the next five or tenyears.    It was for the Government to tell their Military Ad-vis ers :    &quot;These are the risks which you have to provideagainst&quot;, and &quot;This is the basis cn which you must act&quot;.The Postmaster-General enquired whether our MilitaryEstimates would not be influenced by the fact that the UnitedStates of America apparently intended to adhere to eonscrip-tion and to maintain a standing army of 1,500,0002The Prime Minister said that,  in his opinion, theWashington Government could never carry conscription.The Secretary of State for Tar remarked that, in anycase, this would not affect our military problem.The Prime Minister, continuing, said that they couldnot take risks with Labour.    If we did, we should at oncecreate an enemy within our own borders, and one which wouldbe better provided with dangerous weapons than Germany.    Wehad in this country millions of men who had been trained toarrass and there were plenty of guns and ammunition available.In five or ten years&apos; time it would be necessary to reviewthe situation;    but,. so far as external foes were concerned,he felt that risks could be taken.    No risks, however, couldbe taken in respect of the health and the labour of thepeople.   SFe had to lay at once the sure foundations of
national health and industrial prosperity.   He would ask theWar Cabinet to consider whether they should not separateinto small Committees,  each of which would be instructed toconsider one of the various problems to which he had referredthat morninft.     3efore doinc so, however, he felt that thegeneral outlines of the policy of the Government in regardto these questions must be discussed by the Cabinet itself.A very important question was that of our TradePolicy, viz.,  (a) trade within the Empire;    (b) foreigntrade;    (e) home trade.    The President of the Board of Tradehad prepared and submitted to him an exhaustive statementwhich he (Sir Lloyd Georee) regarded as a very valuable docu-ment.    He was in general agreement with Sir Auckland Geddee&apos;proposals, and he though&apos;  that they should be circulatedwithout delay to all who were present that corning.The last problem.to which he proposed to refer wasthat of Ireland.    The Irish question, in his opinion, hadmore to do with the existing industrial unrest than the greatmajority of people imagined.    The policemen on strike, themany agitators who were, actively engaged in various partsof the country in stirring up trouble and fomenting unrest,were generally of Irish extraction, and they were creating avicious at .osphere.    He had been told by the Commissioner ofthe Metropolitan Police that none of his Irish officers werereally to be trusted.    A satisfactory settlement of the Irishquestion was most important Prom the point of view, not onlyof the position a3 regards   the Indus&apos;rial world, but alsoof our   -elations with the Dominions and the United States.The Secretary of State for Tar pointed out that It:.1bo affected the military position, as,  In view of eontln-gencies in Ireland, &quot;e had to maintain there a large garriseof 60,000,  each man of which cost us approximately  S50yearly.
The Prime Minister, proceeding, said that he suggestedthe :*a- Cabinet should first have a general discussion on allthe topics to which he had made allusion.    The idea he wishedto put forward was that small Committees should be arrangedto deal with each of these problems.    Some of these problemswere very urgent, as a pledge had been given to Parliamentthat a statement would be made of the Government&apos;s policybefo-e Parliament rose0,    and Committees to consider thesemore crucial questions would have to start work at once.One of the most urgent questions was that of profiteering.Ke understood that at present there existed no legislativepowers under which the Government could act against profit-eers.    Ke enquired whether the Lord Chancellor was preparedto rive an ooinion. on this subject.The Lord Chancellor said that he would look into thematter and give a considered opinion, as soon as possible,in respect of the legal powers of the Government,The Prime Linister thought it was desirable that aemail Bill should be introduced without delay, which wouldenable the Board of Trade to deal with profiteers.    Hext,the Government ought to be in a position to make some announce-ment about their industrial policy.    He thought it just pos-aible that the Yorkshire strike might collapse, in whichcase the Yorkshire miners might be so indignant with MrSmillie for his attitude towards them that they would deserthim.    &quot;he Government would then be in a more advantageousposition.    It might be preferable to wait and see whetherthe Yorkshire strike did not fizzle out, before we riskedprovoking a general strike by declaring against nationalisa-tion.    In conclusion, the Prime Minister again reminded theTar Cabinet that many of the -bar e problems were of a veryurgent character, i.e., our policy in regard to profiteering,the nationalisation of mines, and trade in general, and thatthe Cabinet would ha--&apos;S to get to work upon them at once, asParliament - ould rise before many days were out.
The Chancellor cf the- Exchequer said he wished toexpress his profound relief that the Prime Minister hadmade, for the benefit of his colleagues, so comprehensivea survey of the field of future policy,  -and he was sure thathe was voicing the general sentiment of the Ministers presentwhen he said that they were most grateful to him.    He wasentirely in favour of taking every possible action success-*fully to cope with profiteering, both now and in the future.The Lord Chancellor- suggested that a small CabinetCommittee might be appointed, to assemble at the Board ofTrade, to consider profiteering;    the Committee to consist oftwo or three Ministers, to whom should be added one or twolegal experts.The Prime ILlnister said that, as a question of policy wasinvolved, he hoped that perhaps the Lord Chancellor himselfwould be able to arrange to attend the meetings of theCommittee.
Mr. Bonar said that suggestion had been made for taking over the control of the wool in this country.

The Postmaster-General stated that the application of the 8 hours&apos; rule had dislocated business and put the whole of the wool trade out of joint.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer deprecated control for the following reason. The moment you began control you were inevitably driven to complete control which, if prolonged led to nationalisation, which was therefore, only a question of time. Control eliminated all the usual motives which induced economic production. The whole burden of making things move was thrown upon the Controller, and all the moral machinery interested in increasing production became moribund.

The President of the Board of Trade stated that he himself did not favour control. His views as to the proper and only solution of the problem of profiteering had already been explained to the Cabinet (War Cabinet 591. Minute 9). Briefly, his scheme was one of local tribunals to deal with retail prices with powers of reference to ad hoc tribunals which would be expert bodies. His idea was that the Board of Trade should take the necessary action in regard to the restraint of trade, to cover big profiteers, that is to say, the productive stages of industry and manufacture; the distributive stages being left to the local tribunals to deal with. The alternative, which he himself regarded as most pernicious, was that the State only should become the sole producer of necessary commodities. This should mean a more intense control than existed during the war, and, as the Chancellor pointed out, must lead eventually to nationalisation.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer remarked that nationalcontrol also created international questions of great complexity.The Minister of Health oppressed general agreement withthe Chancellor and the President of the Board of Trade, as inhis view control must inevitably lead to nationalisation.The Postmaster-General hoped that the proposed Comrnltteoon profiteering would comprise some member with a Yd doexperienoe of working largo businesses.Tho Lord Cha cellor agreed thst it was desirable that thereshould be on the Committee someone with knowledge of the processeof business, if the Committee v.ore expected to make practicalsuggestions as regards the application of corrective methods.The Prims Minister suggested that the Committee shouldconsist of tae President of the Board of Trade (as Chairman),the Lord Chancellor, the Minister of Labour.,  the&apos; Secretary ofState for Sootland -and tho Pocitmsster-Gencral.^ This. y; S agreed to ).Mr. Bonar Law thought that by appointing such a Committeethere were advantages to be gained from tho papf-holcgical pointof view.The Prime Minister agreed that the result of merely announcithat such a Committee had bean appointed would probably be tocheck profiteering.The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought that, by letting inlight, not onay would a check bo placed upon the real profiVebrs,but also a certain amount of misconception would be removedin regard to people who wars popularly believed to be makingextravagant profits.The Secretary of State for War drew attention to tkoestablishment of Consumers5 Loaguos in Prance which, beunderstood, were doing good work.    Tho procedure adoptedwas to work up public opinion through the/-15- .
medium of the Press,   Certain districts then agreed to boycottsome commodity which vras being sold at an excessive price -e.g. tomatoes,    The effect of this was to make the price fallvery rapidly,,    This remedy could not be applied, of course, inthe case of the actual necessities of life, but a well-organisedboycott might, he thought, be very efficacious in the case ofo the r c ommodo t i e s.The First Lord of the Admiralty pointed out that the par-ticular men the Government wished to help were the working classes5and yet it was these very classes who were driving prices up onaccount of the purchases they made with their higher wages.The President of the Board of Education suggested that aspeech by the Prime Minister on the whole question of profiteeringwould have an admirable effect throughout the country,,   At presenteverybody thought that he uas entitled to more money than he hadreceived before the war, *The Prime Minister  said he wished to Impress hpon hiscolleagues the necessity for maintaining the closest secrecyin regard to the policy they might decide to adopt.    It was mostimportant that none of their proposals should become knoim before theGovernment announced that policy.    In particular, a prematurediscussion in the Press would place the Government in a ^j^ydifficult position.   As regards their trade policy., he r.hourbtthat there should be a &quot;Second Reading&quot; discussion upon * L i&quot; theTar Cabinet,The   Minister of Health suggested that a &quot;Second Reading&quot;discussion upon profiteering was also desirable,Mr, Barnes enquired what the Ministry of Health was aoingin regard, to billeting in empty houses.The First Lord of the Admiralty pointed out that theGovernment had quite lately been giving amazing prices for land.Three large purchases recently had been made In one or two countiesfromThere the prices had run ins.  60 to  90 an acre.   This might have
been avoided if the Government had. quietly consulted the principalland agents in the first instance.The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the &apos;.7ar Cabinetthat he had recently made representations to the Board, of Agri-culture about the excessive prices that had been paid for landiThe Secretary of State for Par said that he had read, thememorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the financialposition and he thought that Mr. Chameerlain had perhaps somewhatexaggerated the difficulties confronting the Government.    Therev.-ere two points he wished to mention; first, we were, no doubt,face to face with a grave situation, but the  1 sterling wasonly worth naif what it was before the Par, its purchasing powerhad been reduced by half, and only half the amount of exertionwas required to earn it.    But, the taxable revenue of the countryhad been more than doubled, as the workmen&apos;s wages were reachingthe taxable scale and a graduated system operating on theswollen Incomes benefitteu the State.    The graduated scale oftaxation brought a larger number of people Into its ambit.   Further,the Chancellor had assumed that for the following year the cost ofthe Army, the llavy and the Air Force would amount to  350,000,000sterling.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that  350,000,000was a pure guess on his part.    He wished to take this opportunityof correcting a regrettable mistake in certain figures in his&quot;merp.oranO.urii.    He had been asked to divide up the above roughforecast, among the three services, shoning the amount estimatedfor each, and unfortunately tbe figures he had given had been theestimate s for this year and not for 1919/20.-   The mistake hadbeen rectified in the printed Minutes.
The Secretary of State for Tar expressed the view thatthare was no justification for so high an estimate.    The ex-penditure this year of the fighting forces had neoesearily&quot;teenguided by events.    He reminded the War Cabinet that there weremany extraordinary winding-up charges;    for instance, therewere soldiers abroad who were to be demobilised,  there was alarge number of men still  in hospital, and no less than 66,000,000 had to be paid in gratuities.    The following year,events would no longer govern expenditure, which would then becontrolled by the policy decided upon by the Cabinet.    It wasfor the Tar Cabinet clearly to define the various responsi-bilities of the fighting services;    in other words, they muststate that there would be no great European war for the nextfive or ton years.    Thoymust also define what arrangementsshould be made for the maintenance of a sufficient force tosupport the civil power in a case of emergency;    further, theGovernment must determine the size of the garrisons to bemaintained in Ireland, Mesopotamia,  India, Egypt,.etc.    Itwould then be for the fighting departments to consider howthe obligations imposed upon them by the Government couldbest and most economically be discharged,      He would ventureupon a forecast, which was necessarily very vague, that theexpenditure on the Army and Air Force in 1919/20 would notexceed  100,000,000,The Chancellor of the Exchequer enquired, whether thisIncluded the overlap from tho current year into 1920.The Secretary of State for War thought that everyendeavour should be made to pay before the end of the presentfinancial year all outstanding bills, and to make the 12months commencing from the 1st April 1920 a normal year,all expenses being from that date onward cut down in duerelation to the actual revenue of the country.
As regards tho size of the Army, in January last it oon-sistsd of over tv/o million mien whom it had been intended ttrreduce to about 850,000.    He hoped that by the end of thefinancial year the Army would contain no conscripts whatever,and that vs.3 should not find it necessary to maintain morethan about 320,000 men.     Before the War, tho regular Armyconsisted of about 255,000, of whom 75,000 were in theArm:/&quot; in India, and 180,000 were in England or in our garrisonsabroad.      Ho felt that the expenditure on the Army in 1914should be taken as a datum lino, and that definite justi-fication should be shown for every extension of expenditurebeyond that line.      If, for Instance, the Army wererelieved of all anxiety as regards the continent of Europe,,that would tend to alter very materially the plansob the military authorities,&apos;,The Prime Minister enquired why it was intended toretain a force of three or four hundred thousand men nextyear.The Secretary of htate for &apos;7ar explained that thenumber of volunteers in the Army at present was about250,000,  but that most of thorn had joined for short periodsonly.       The Uar Office had been proceeding on the lines ofobtaining as many volunteers as possible in order toaccelerate the disappearance of the noed for conscription,A discussion on tho size of the post-war Army was urgentlynecessary;    but it should be remembered that our responsi-bilities during the  .&quot;ai had considerably increased, especiallyin regard to Ireland and the Seat.The Prime Minister remarked that the Mar had shownhow Immense was the superiority of equipment, such as tanks,guns and aeroplanes.    In the old days the use of armour hadsaved the employment of men;    and so to-day a possiblee ..tenaion of the use of equipment should bo taken intoaccount in, con elder in.;., the size of the post-war Army.
The Minister of Health suggested that first of alla statement was required of the purposes for which the Armywould, he used.      Then it would he  possible to make estimatesof the size of the Army,The &apos;first Lord of the Admiralty stated that theAdmiralty was being constantly accused of extravagance, but itwas impossible to reduce expenditure at present more than, wasbeing done.      He woald circulate a Memorandum to the War Cabinetshowing the duties upon which the Wavy was at present engaged,and it would then be for the Cabinet to docido our future Haval&quot;policy,,The Prime fiinister enquired the number of raon in theAmerican Wavy.The first Lord said that the American Government hadrecently announced their intention of keeping up to fullbtrength for the first time their three fleets, namely, theAtlantic, Pacific and China fleets.      He would obtain the numbersof men in these fleets end inform the Tar Cabinet accordingly.He w..s trying to reduce the British Wavy to below the pre-wartstrength, but it was not easy to accomplish on account of thefact that most of the men were serving on long-term engagements.Until it was Known what specific duties the Navy of the futurevould have to perform it was not possible to give an estimateof its strength.The Prime Minister said that the question of policycould be dealt with in two ways.    (1) The far Cabinet couldgo into the question itself in detail.    (2)    The Committee ofImperial Defence could be set up again to consider the policiesproposed by the Service Departments, and could make a report thereon to the War Cabinet, in whose hands would rest the finaldecision.    It was necessary to know, however, the periodof time for which a policy was desired,;      It was not aquestion of deciding upon a policy for the next twentyyears;   perhaps for not as long as ten years;    possibly only
for fivo years*    He would like to know the period for v/hichthe Admiralty and the War Office wished, a policy to beprepared.    In any case,, he felt that the   ar Cabinet vias theplace In which the policy should first be discussed.The Secretary of State for 17ar suggested that it mightbe worth while for the    dmiralty the &quot;Jar Office and the AirMinistry to prepare     memoranda showing the particular re-sponsibilitles which It was anticipated they might have tomeet during the next five or ten yearsoThe President of the Board of Education said that theIndia Office should also be asked to provide a statementShowing the policy with regard to the size of the nativeArmy In India 0The Chancellor of the Exchequer remarked, that he wasconvinced from his short experience at the India Office thatthe Indian Army was In no way up to date at the outbreakof war.    Instead of being the best prepared force in theEmpire, It was In fact rather behindhand, and the BritishArmy had advanced far more quickly than the Indian Army.Apart from that, too, they had had little or no conceptionof the mechanical dcvelopmentc^whlch were looming ahead of us.The Prime Minister said &quot;that that was a most Importantpoints    It seemed to him that the trouble in Afghanistan hadbeen brought to an end by a ^accession of air raids.   He thoughtv;e were inclined to under-estimate the enormous value ofscientific weapons.&apos;The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he thoughtthat more attention was now being given to the question ofmotor transport and the itse of aeroplanes by the Governmentof India.The Prime Minister suggested that similar considerationsapplied to Ireland and enquired if It were really necessaryto retain in Ireland all the troops who were there6The Secretary of State for War explained that the Viceroy
and the Irish Government were engaged in rullrt  a country whosepeople wished to rebel.    It had been left to the men on the spotto ask for the number of troops required for the purpose, andmore and. mere troops were being asked forj and all he (Mr.Churchill) could do was to supply the troops demanded.    CivilAuthorities invariably asked for more troops than the militaryauthorities thought were necessary.    The same thing had happenedin the case of Liverpool,Mr. Barnes suggested that a Committee should be inane -$lately set tip to consider the Irir^ question.    It was a pro-blem the solution of which could not await a settlement ofthe general question of.devolution.The prime Minister doubted if it would be possible toproclaim a policy as regards Ireland before the House rose,in view oJ.    he amount of work which it was necessary to cover,The Secretary of State for far expressed the opinionthat the present was not a good time to look for an Irishsolution.    In a few months the position would probably beeasier.    It had already improved and the people vrere not onlyvery prosperous, but they were beginning to lose.faith in theprotagonists of Sinn Fein, who had carried out none of theirpromise s.The First Lord agreed with the Secretary of State for17ar, and remarked that the Lord Lieutenant had informed himo* a considerable improvement in the temper of the country,particularly in the Test,-during the last three months.The Minister of Health suggested that we had everythingto lose by postponing a decision on the Irish question.    Bothin the United States and In every country where there was anIrish element public opinion was becoming antagonistic toGreat Britain,The Prime Minister pointed out that it would be very-difficult to produce a policy before the Recess, especially
since there would be no opportunity of carrying it into effectbefore the autumn.    He thought the Par Cabinet had as much asthey could do if they &apos;^ere going to deal with profiteering,finance and housing as veil as announce a coal policy in thenext fortnight.    Replying to a suggestion by the President ofthe Board of Education that the Government should at leastannounce again that they were not going to be content with apurely negative attitude towards Ireland, Mr. Lloyd Georgepointed out that they h id already gone beyond that In theoffer they had made to Mr. Redmond before the meeting of theIrish Convention.    He added that in spite of all the criticismthat had btsen made from time to time by the Northcliffe press,the scheme for an Irish settlement ,vhich had appeared In theTimes some days previously consisted substantially of proposalswhich the Government themselves had made.The Secretary of State for -&quot;ar remarked that nothing v ouldannoy the Irish more than the  conviction that they were not ab-sorbing the mirds of the people of Great Britain.    His ownopinion was that if we alloved matters to remain as they werefor the next few months, the Irish people -would be more readyto accept a settlement than they had ever been.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would like toraise the question of the machinery for deal Ing with Governmentexpenditure.    V-hen he    (Mr. Chamberlain) became Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, the Prime Minister had indicated that he had inmind the setting-up of a Finance Committee.    A few meetingshad been held, which had been attended by the Prime Minister,Mr. Bonar Law, Lord Milner, himself,   end later, Sir AucklandGeddes, and had been most useful.    It would be of immense assisttance if, in the re-organisation of P&apos;ar Cabinet work which thePrime Minister was contemplating for the autumn,  that bodycould   be set up as a permanent Committee and if he could havethe  considered judgment of the Committee on large financial pro-posals before they came to the Par Cabinet, and upon whoserecommendations the latter would /
be able to base a decision.      Further,  if, as he believedwas certainj we should be obliged in the coming year to meetfresh expenditure.,  it would be a great advantage if a Committeeof this hind could/exxmine with him the sources and schemes oftaxation.The Prime Minister agreed that a Committee as suggestedby the Chancellor of the Exchequer would be invaluable.    Hehimself had always tried to act on a system of that kind..   TheChancellor of the Exchequer was apt to find himself alone inopposing the proposals of other Ministers.The Secretary of State for Tar said he hoped that thisCommittee would only deal with big questions of finance, andthat it would not be necessary to refer to it every smallproposal that Departments put forward.      His own idea was thata block total for expenditure should be arrived at and thatthe people who scent the money should be made responsible forthe policy upon which it was expended.The Prime Minister pointed out that j  in a question likehousing,  it was not fair that the Chancellor of the Exchequeralone should bear the onus of criticising any proposals whichwere put forward.      Such, proposals should, be referred to thefinance Committee suggested by Mr.  Chamberlain.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he felt that itwas not extravagance which *-ms our danger so much as that wewere trying to carry into effect at one   . moment more schemesfor the benefit of the country than we were able to afford.The Secretary of State for Tar said that he presumedthat any Minister whose proposals were being considered bythe Committee would for the time become a member of theCommittee.Mr.  Bonar Law said that a decision was urgent  in thecase of the Profiteering Bill, which had to be introducedinto tho House immediately.
The War Cabinet decided --(a) That care should be taken not to di.3-cu.gs -outside the Cabinet the. quest-ions of gen-eral policy now under considerat ion, asany general discussion in the press atthis preliminary stage would hamper futuredis cussion:(b). That a Committee, composed as follows :-Sir Auckland Geddes (in the Chair),Sir Robert Home,The Lord Chancellor,Mr IIlingworth,Mr kunro,should be  set up to consider the questionof Profiteering, with special reference tothe Board of Trade proposals for the estab-lishment of Tribunals, and immediately tcprepare a draft Bill to empower the Govern-ment to deal effectively with the question:(c) To hold a Second Heading Cabinet discussionon the questions of:-Coal,(Trade,&apos;Housing,Expenditure:(d) The Minister of Health to be given an nppor-tunity at an early date to explain to theCabinet the present position on housing,including emergency housing:(o)  In connection with the discussion on expen-diture,  the Admiralty, War Office and IndiaOffice to prepare such material as they con-sider may be useful to the Cabinet in thepossible formulation of a statement of theresponsibilities to be undertaken by theAdmiralty and war Office during the nextfive or ten years.    The First Lord of theAdmiralty in particular to report as to thestrength of the Navy of the United Statesof America, present and future:(f) A Committee, composed of:-The Prime Minister,Mr Bonar Law,The Chancellor of the Exchequer,Lord Milner,Sir Auckland Geddes,to be set up for the purpose of discussingquestions involving la-&apos;ge financial expendi-ture, and other financial questions.
