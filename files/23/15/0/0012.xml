He was fully prepared to defend theaction of the Executive in - relation to Westport and the MansionHouse meeting, hut he would he pressed to define the Governmentspolicy in regard to Ireland generally.Mr. Bonar Lav? siigge-sted that he should have no difficultyin this respect.     Tixa Governments policy had been dlearlydefined.   To this Mr. Macpherson demurred by a gesture.Mr. Bonar Law continued that he proposed to reply in theHouse of Commons that the -Prime Minister would not see theAmerican delegates *   Unfortunately the situation in Parisin respect to the American delegates was not so clear as hehad thoughts     She Prime Minister had been under theimpression that the delegates were coming at the request ofPresident Wilson to see conditions in Ireland.     In fact theycame from Wisemanwlio thought he was speaking for PresidentWilson.Mr. Macpherson -said that he had wished to deport theAmericans on Tuesday, and in conjunction with, the Viceroyhad asked to be allowed to do so.     He knew nothing that haddone more harm in Ireland than the proceedings of theAmerican delegation, and had never been informed that theywere to be allowed to come.     As they were armed with passports
with the British vise ha res hepeless in the matter,     Th&amp; IrishExecutive had successfully suppressed the arrangements for therecaption of .13a Valera and the effect had been good, but thedangerous speeches made by the American delegates has been dis-astrous in the extreme and ha regarded the attack on -he train asthe direct sequel and was prepared for similar incidents to follow.Ee - was perfectly certain that there would be a big attempt at arebellion,     Shere were 4,000 armed Volunteers in the DublinDistrict alone.     In each locality where arrests had been madeparticulars had been found of bridges to he cut down and of carefulmilitary plans.     More forces had been required and these had beenasked for.     One of the great difficulties was that in view ofpast experience^ subordinate -officials *in Ireland wore afraid tctake responsibility.     He had been obliged to promise his personalsupport to the officer in charge of the Westport District.    JSe bad-Bent for two District Inspectors from the West of Ireland with whomhe had long conversations.     Ee found that he. was the first ChiefSecretary they had seen since the Balfour Administration.     Theywere certain, that rebellion would break out, and remembering theHarrell incident ware afraid that they would n&amp;t be supper tod bythe Executive.Lord Carson aaid that the Asquith Administration in 1916 hadmet with disaster in Ireland owing to the failure of Mr. Birrellto inform his colleagues of the true state of affairs *     SheCabinet were new faced with.a situation in Ireland which was muchworse than they had thought though they all knew the conditionswere bad.   3?hey could not say they ware not informed .     Shorewere 4,000 armed Volunteers in the neighbourhood of Dublin alone.Dp to the time of the General Election there waa a War Cabinetorder that once a month the lord Lieutenant should send a Report;about the condition of Ireland*     It began in the days of LordWimborna and Mr. Buke.     fhat went on for a time and theirenergies got rather slack.     2ho Report ceased to appear., . Eeremembered calling attention to the matter whan Lord French was
&quot;3-67appointed.     9!hey had had one or two reports from Lord French.*lS&quot;he Acting Secretary stated that lie had written   twice, tolord French in the matter, but owing to his illness there had &quot;beena delay in issuing the Report.Lord Curzon said that if Lord -French were unable to attendto it, the Chief Secretary ought to report from time to time.   TheCat)inst ought to have a discussion on the whole Irish ypms&amp;sSsmxxposition.     He observed that the Chief Secretary was -asking forinstructions.She Chief Secretary said the: first thing he would do wouldbe to proclaim tho Sinn Fein Volunteers.Ms?, Bonar Law said the Cabinet would support him in anythinghe now suggested *     -Ehe &quot;basis on which he was appointed was thatthe Cabinet gave him a free hand.Mr. MscphersOB said that he hag. asked at a previous Cabinetto be allowed to proclaim the Sinn Fein organisation and Mr.Walter Long had replied that the proposal was discussed in Mr.Is opal tits time, and was rejected.Mr. Ohamte rlain thoug&amp;fc that the Government were clearlyentitled to do it.Mr, Maoplierson said that the position in Ireland was *Bm&amp;BLchanged for the worse.     things were going all right up till lastweek, but the incident of the day before was a sign of the con-fideuce that had been given to tho rebels by the Americandelegation.  .Mr. Bonar Law suggested that the Chief Secretary should sendto the War Cabinet the proposals of the Irish Executive, and getLord French and Mr. Long to attend in order to agree on the courseproposed.Mr. Chamberlain, said that in view of the very grave statementthat Mr. Maepherson had made he did not like ^xsasStasisaklSSS delayingthe proclamation of Sinn Fein.     He asked whether Mr. Long *sanswer that the proposal had been discussed and. rejected &quot;before
meant that Mr. Long was opposed to it on its merits.Mr. Maooherson said that it did not.     She remark hadbeen incidental, as the Cabinet were not then really oon-side ring the Irish question.Mr. fisher said it was necessary to he very careful.Is aid not say that he would not proclaim Sinn life in ^ but thematter must be thoroughly srtaraiaed-     His impressions werethat the Sinn feiners were a composite party of the criminalclasses, the physical force party and the intellectuals *-i&apos;ho real point was that it was supported by the morallealere of the country - the clergy.     It was a very diffi-eult thing to proclaim an association that had the moralsupport of the country.     On the other hand, law and ordermust bo rigidly enforced and all steps taken.that might benecessary to put down rebellion.     So only wanted to bevery careful.Mr. Bonar Law said that it would be a serious thingbecause it would involve suppressing an organisation whichrepresented a great part of the South of Ireland, but itmight have to bo done.     &apos;Iha Chief Secretary must be surethat ha had sufficient force.Mr. Macphereon saitf that if the Irish pwople saw that laworder had the Government behind them they would be verymuch easier to control.
