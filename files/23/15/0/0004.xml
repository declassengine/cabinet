WAR CABINET 538 A.



DRAFT MINUTES of a Meeting held at 10, Downing Street, S.W., on FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 1919, AT 11-30 a.m.



The War Cabinet had under consideration Paper W.C.P. 129,  containing Marshal Foch&apos;s proposals in regard to the delimitation of German frontiers, and M. Tardieu&apos;s Note to Mr Balfour (Paper W.C.P.135).

The Secretary of State for War said that the contents of the Paper had caused him some surprise, as the French apparently envisaged the permanent control of the Rhine bridgeheads. He noticed that Marshal Foch made no attempt to estimate the size of the International Force, and before the Government gave their considered reply to these proposals he suggested that it would be as well to find out:-

(a) What size the force was to be:

(b) Whether the United States would contribute.

The size of the force should, of course, be sufficient, in the event of a sudden German attack, to stem the avalanche long enough to enable the bridges to be destroyed and the main International Army to be mobilised. Mr Churchill then urged upon the Cabinet the necessity of winding up all military matters with the least possible delay. All the intelligence received by him was to the same effect, that cruel privations were being suffered by the German people at the present time. He himself wished to see Germany treated humanely and adequately fed, and her industries re-started. He had little patience with the cranks of various kinds who denied that Germany


 suffered any privations at all, and advanced exaggerated claims for indemnity. He thought that the step proposed by Marshal Foch might prove to be a wise one, subject to America bearing her share, but, as stated above, we must not, in his view, decide whether to endorse this policy until we had ascertained the intentions of the United States. It was highly desirable, in his opinion, that in handling this question we should show ourselves as sympathetic as possible to the French, for two reasons: first, in order that she might show herself accommodating in regard to our own Eastern policy: and, second, to enable us to require great influence over France and the Peace Conference generally, with a view to the adoption of a merciful policy towards Germany. Incidentally, he suggested that France might feel a greater sense of security if we would meet her wishes in regard to the construction of the Channel Tunnel.

The Prime Minister enquired whether it was conceivable that a force consisting of less than 150,000 men could hold the bridgeheads. Such a force must be able to withstand the enemy&apos;s onset for at least 48 hours, and if the United States, France and Great Britain made equal contributions to that force they would each have to supply at least 30,000 men.   He doubted very much whether the country would be prepared to supply a permanent garrison of this size for the Rhine, when troops at any moment might be needed in India and elsewhere. He wished to ask what was the Foreign Office view of the proposition to set up a separate German Republic West of the Rhine, the Republic to be entirely disconnected from Germany East of the River; and also of the further proposition that Germany should be compelled to relinquish all idea of union with the Germans of Austria. His own mind had not been made up on the matter, and he would like to discuss the whole question with the Cabinet before he returned to Paris. At present he inclined to the view of the Secretary of State for War, that we should give France all


possible support in respect of her claims and desires in the- eat, so long as those claims did not leave a legacy of in.jus-tie e which would rankle as Alsace-Lorraine bad rankled.M. Clemenceau loved hie own country just as he hated and fearedGermany, and he was not partienlarly concerned about the East.One of Mm Olemenceau&apos;s amoitiona was to see a small independentrepublic, which would comprise the whole of the coalfields,to be set up &quot;feat of the Saine, to be entirely independent ofGermany and to be controlled,  but not annexed, by Franco.lord Oursen said that , before expressing a consideredopinion on the present proposition, he would iiji.? time foreonsideration.    He reminded the Cabinet that practically the&quot;fhole of the senior&apos; and experienced officials of hie Departmentwere in Paris, which enormously increased hie labour and tSiffi-cultiea.    be himself would greatly like to see an arrangementby this country with France which should cover not only thevoatters now before the Peace Congress,  but should range avera much wider field and include such countries as Morocco,fie suggested that we should endeavour to get an ail-roundcomposition of our outstanding difficulties with the French.Holding the bridgeheads wag one method which wa ? suggestedin order to ensure France against future aggressioat   hewondered whether there were not alternative -methods of ster-illsing German action, which mipht be examined by the militaryexperts.   As regards the possibility of Germany re-startingthe manufacture of munitions, he thought it mi-bt prove verydifficult to stop her doing this,    inanitions, submarines, guns,etc., could be quietly manufactured in different parts? of thecountry, and even if it were possible to devise a completelysatisfactory system of inspection there would remain the.dif-ficulty of selecting the precise moment for getting the Leagueof Nations to enforce the stoppage of the taanufacture.Mr Chamberlain said, in regard to Lord Cur4on&apos;a point asto whether there were not alternative method? of, &amp;a he had said,

Supposing in tenyears&apos;  time Germany declared that she intended then to buildships, fiUna, and so on, he &apos;did riot think it would be Verydifficult to stop her.   There was no doubt that the UnitedStates would be prepared to take up anas again in order toensure the disarmament of any offending Power, though shewould not *to to war for indemnities or territorial acquisition,He did not share Lord Cur.son&apos;s apprehen si ons in reqard to thepossibility of the secret -manufacture of munitions on a widescale in Germany.    Our own &quot;intelligence before the &apos;&quot;ar hadbeen admirable * and we. had known exactly what type of suns,etc.-, Germany was producing.The Secretary of State for War thought that Germany wouldR,et to ^0&quot;k quietly producing munitions and completing herplans, but shq would oni\ oo:ae into the open when we and curpresent Allies or associates began to quarrel, as might unfor-tunately be the ease in future.    There was no doubt that theRepublican Party in the United States was bent on disentangling,their country from Europe, one results of which might be thatone day t -ey would start competition in-armaments.    He thoughtthat there was a serious danger that, unless Peace came -soon,hussia -.iud G &quot;-mws-ily might make eoxomon cause.
