In particular, the social conditionsof the mining villages in Scotland were worse than in England,in spite of the fact that the mineral rights were rateableand belong to the local Authorities.    If the proposed levywas put into effect, would the Exchequer have to pay a con-tribution to the local Authorities in Scotland, in lieu ofthe rates they were now receiving from mineral rights?    Ifthis was the case,  it would result in a similar demand fromthe Local Authorities in England.The Prime Minister pointed out that, in Scotland,there had always been a levy for the rates on the mineralroyalties.    In England and Tales,  there had. been no suchlevy, with the result that the royalty contributed nothing.All the Reports of the Sankey Commission hid agreed in the(mijl-PPQW^ent is the Property of Kis Brit^ni.M&amp;Je JjA\sJ*Qvernment .1
need fnr social amelioration and,,development in thecondition of the miners.    If now the State purchased theroyalties,  the cost  of this would immediately fall on theState:    that was to say, upon the Exchequer, unless,  inpurchasing the royalties,  a deduction was iradc to form aspecial fund for the purpose.The first Lord of the Admiralty said that, althoughrat imthis proposal was affecting the,law by bringingpersonalty&quot;&quot;&quot;into the rates, he was in favour of making personaltymake such a contribution:    and,  in reply to a suggestionthat such a levy might add to the weapons of the mineralright owners,  especially if they considered an unfair price-was being paid in compensation, Mr? Long stated that he thoughthe danger was rather that such a levy would be regarded asso just by all the old reformers of taxation that they woulddemand its extension.Mr Bonar Law said that, although he was not againstthe proposed levy,,  its effects should be considered, and itmight raise the whole question of confiscation.Lord Ourson asked how it was proposed to obtain equal-it y between England and Scotland,,    It had not been decidedto whom the 10 per cent, levy on mineral rights in Englandshould be paid.-,   That would happen in Scotland?    Was it sug-gested that the levy should be the same as in England, whenin fact the Scottish mineral owners rights were alreadyrateable?The Prime Minister said that the State wo ill d have toshoulder the obligation in Scotland.The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought there wasdanger in this course.    He asked what would happen to theowner of mineral   rights in Scotland who got, say,  1,000 ayear from his royalties and paid so much in mineral rights.duty,   so much in mineral excess duty,  and so much in rates?That would leave &quot;aim,  say,   300 a year.    In buying out thisperson they would buy him out  at so many years&apos;  purchase of 800.    Having done that, should the State have a share in
the taxation hitherto levied in Mineral Rights Duty?The Prime Minister said that,  supposing a man wasreceiving  1,000 a year from mineral royalties in England,and an owner in Scotland -was receiving only,  say,   600 a year,owing to the rateable charge:    the English owner would bereceiving  400 a year more than the Scottish owner, becausehe had succeeded in evading his social obligations.    Whenthe State came to buy out these rights,  the Pn-iish owner,at IS years&apos;  purchase, would receive  15,000,  and the Scottishowner only  9,000.    It wag on this question that the Commis-sion said that we had nearly been precipitated into a socialrevolution because somebody neglected to look after the oon-ditions of the miners.    This must be put right.    Mr JusticeSankey had suggested that Id. extra should be charged per tonon coal for this purpose, and thus distribute the cost ofbettering the miners&apos;  conditions on the consumer.    He (thePrime Minister) suggested that the first  charge should be onthe mineral itself and not on the consumer, to whom the priceof coal was already too high.    He would raise in England andPales a considerable sum by this means,  in order to make themining villages habitable.    The miners were keeping thecountry in a state of ferment,  and this would continue so longas mining conditions remained in their present state.The Minister of Labour thought that, before coming toa definite conclusion on this subject, it would be as well toget examples of how the rating law on mineral rights workedin different parts of Scotland.    He thought that a possibleargument might be put forward by the English owners * to theeffect that the fact that a Scottish mineral right owner paidrates on these rights was taken into account when paying hisordinary rates.(It was agreed that the Minister of Labourshould go into this matter and ascertain,by reference to the Scottish coalfields,what  rate would be fair to levy on theScottish mineral royalty owners, and then-bring the matter before the Cabinet.)
ABarnes ex-rssed a;ong pre-rence forragraph 2its orig-&apos;1 form.The Prime Minister said that if,, by wording theseparagraphs in a certain way, a strike would be brought about,and by wording them another way a strike would be avoided,he would choose the latter0    His impression, however, wasthat the miners did not want a-strike.The Minister of Labour said that he thought the minerswere getting tired of the idea of striking, and,  in fact, inSouth TJales meetings . of miners had been held protestingagainst nationalisation. . fir Clynes had gone the length ofstating that the miners had no right to strike for national-&apos;isation, as that was a political and not an industrial problem.After a discussion, .. it was agreed that the following,suggested by Mm Bonar Law, , should be Inserted in place ofparagraphs 2, 3 and 4 of the Memorandum:-&quot;The Government.after careful examination ofall the Reports of the Coal Commission and theevidence given before it, have come to the con-olusion that they would not be justified inundertaking the State purchase and State manage-msnt of collieries, and apart from any questionof the desirability or otherwise of the nation-alisation of the coal mines, the financial burdenon the country, having regard to other essentialobligations on the State, is in itself such asto preclude its adoption&quot;,The Cabinet&apos; then discusseh parag-rcrphe- &amp;*-3 and 4 ofthe Memorandum, (Paper G.T ,-7924) ,.......&quot;The Minister of Labour said he thought the. combinedeffect of paragraphs 2 and 3 would create a suspicion thatthe Government was concealing its real view on the matter ofnationalisation.    It might lead people to think that, if theGovernment&apos;s financial position improved, they would be pre-pared to consider nationalisation, though not on a basis simi-lar to that adopted, in the Postal, Telegraph and Telephoneservices.The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed, and thoughtthat, unless the Government stated plainly that it was notgoing to nationalise9 the mining machine would never workefficiently, and would have the effect&apos; of paralysing privateent erprise.
-pnhyaph 5. The Minister- of Labour suggested that the first twolines of the paragraph should be amended as follows:-&quot;With regard to the criticisms by the severalmembers of the Commission upon the presentmethods of operating and controlling thet mines, the Government agree&quot; etc.(This was accepted.)Sir Eric Geddes suggested that in the sane sentence,after the word &quot;lives&quot;,the words &quot;and livelihood&quot; should beinserted,.(Tills was accepted.)iragraph 6. The Prime Minister was of opinion that this paragraph,which enunciated the principle that the Government had ap-proved with regard to the future organisation of the coalindustry, ought certainly to contain something about theGovernment&apos;s intention to improve the social conditions ofthe miners.    This intention, he thought, might be given aprominent place in the proposals.    In all the Reports submit -ted by the Commission,  it was stated that existing conditionswere had.Mr Bonar Lav; agreed,  and suggested that prominencecould best be given to the Government&apos;s intentions in thisrespect by making it the subject of a separate paragraph,Sir Eric Geddes deprecated any disposition to subordinate the interests of this country as a whole to those of theminers, who were only one part of the community.The President of the Board of Education suggested thatit might be stated in the Government&apos;s announcement thatit regarded as a first principle in improving the coal indus-try, the amelioration of conditions in which so many of theemployees in that industry now lived and worked.The Prime Minister said that he thought that the &quot;barCabinet were generally agreed that due prominence should begiven,in the Government&apos;s announcement, to their intentionof improving the social conditions of the miners, and hesuggested that the President of the Board of Education shoulr&apos;be asked to re-draft the Paper which they had now before then

The Minister of Labour suggested that the last sixwords of the second sub-paragraph should be omitted.The President, of the Board of Trade explained thatthese words were only inserted in order to make it clearthat foreign countries requiring our coal could only obtainit by bidding for it in the open market, and not by sendingemissaries to his Department to plead in. forma,, pauneris .The Minister of Labour further suggested that thissub-paragraph might stop at the word &quot;coal&quot;, in the secondline .The Acting Secretary of state for Foreign Affairs didnot agree, as he thought that the sub-^paragraphj with theomission first recommended by Sir Robert Horne$ enunciateda thoroughly sound principle.The Minister of Health said that he agreed with LordCurson, and thought it desirable that something of the kindshould be stated, as international conditions and relationsso closely affected our coal industry.(The first proposal of the Minister of Labour,that the last six words of sub-paragraph  should be omitted, was accepted.    The sent-hnce therefore reads as follows:-&quot;&quot;(ii) Tt must meet the national interestin regard to the export trade incoal,&quot;which must be so organisedthat it is carried on as a com-roe r c ial undo rt aking .&quot; \The Prime Minister said, in regard to our export tradethat it had been suggested that all our available export coalshould pass through a certain agency, the cost of the main-tenance of which should be net by a levy of 6d. a ton. Thisreally amounted to a very considerable additional royalty.The President of the Board of Trade said that adetailed scheme existed in his Department, which he wasprepared to lay before the Tar Cabinet if they so desired.The Minister of Health enquired what the words &quot;non-commercial management&quot;, in sub-paragraph (v),meant.

The sent-ence therefore reads as follows:-&quot;(ii) Tt must meet the national interestin regard to the export trade incoal, which must be so organisedthat it is carried on as a com-rae r c ial undo it aking.&quot; \The Prime Minister said, in regard to our export tradethat it had been suggested that all our available export coa]should pass through a certain agency, the cost of the main-tenance of which should be net by a levy of 6d. a ton.

The President  of the Board of Trade explained thatthe management of mines was of two rinds:    (a) technicalmanagement, which was concerned with the actual working of^ the mines;    and (b) commercial mana.gem.ent, which dealt withsales, purchase of supplier?,  and other things, which did notexactly touch the well-being of the workers.    In reply toa question, Sir Auckland Geddes stated that sub-paragraph 4covered &quot;technical education&quot;.The Prime Minister thought that perhaps sub-paragraph(v) was open to misinterpretation, and suggested that thePresident of the Board of Education,  in re-drafting theMemorandum,  should bear this in mind.(This was accepted.,)agraph 7* The Minister of Health proposed that, after the word&quot;policy&quot; in line 7 of the draft proposals, the words &quot;ofthe group&quot; should be added.(This was accepted.)Sir EricGeddes proposed that, after the word &quot;forward&quot;in line 5 of the sub-paragraph, the following words shouldbe inserted:&apos;-    &quot;for which a time limit will be imposed toavoid unnecessary delay&quot;.(This was accepted.)Sir Eric Geddes,  referring to paragraph 6,  said thatthe six principles enunciated in the paragraph, regarded asthe 1ong-promisod announcement of the Government policy toan expectant country, were singularly thin and unsubstantial.The Secretary of State for the Colonies pointed outthat the policy of the- Government at present was mainlynegative in character.The Minister of Health thought that paragraph 7 mightbe aiven greater nrominence,  and suggested its being placedbefore paragraph 6.    After all, the one solid thing that theminer got out of the Government proposals was his promisedparticipation in the management and benefits of the mines.;
He thought this decision on the part of the C-overnment shouldnot be wrapped up in a late paragraph in the announcement, butbrought into sharp outline.The President of the Board of Trade suggested thatparagraphs 6,  7 and 9 should be embodied in a second paragraph.He agreed with the Minister of Health, and said that the sixso-called important principles enumerated in paragraph 6 werereally much less important than the statements which followed.The Minister of Health thought that the last two linesof the paragraph would suggest to the workers that they wereto have equal representation with other members.Mr Bonar Law suggested that the final sentence mightbe omitted.The Prime Minister suggested that the difficulty mightbe met by inserting the word &quot;individual&quot; before &quot;status&quot;.(This was accepted.)ragraph 8. The Minister of Health expressed the view that the word.&quot;veto&quot;, in the first line, was purely negative, and proposedthat after it the following words should be inserted,&quot;subjectto any modifications&apos;.(This suggestion was remitted to Mr Fisherfor his consideration.)agraph 9, The Minister of Pensions suggested that,  in the firstline, the word &quot;will&quot; should be substituted for &quot;must&quot;.(This was agreed to.)The Prime Minister proposed that the following wordsshould be omitted,, - &quot;for the commercial activities of theindust ry&quot;.(This was agreed to).fagraph 10. The First Lord of the Admiralty enquired whether thefirst three lines of this paragraph were really necessary.Mr Bonar Law agreed that the first sentence of thisparagraph should be omitted, and suggested that the followingshould be substituted for the second and concluding sentencet-
&quot;A scheme on the lines of the above proposalswill at once be prepared, with a view to itssubmission to Parliament with the least pos-sible delay &quot;.The War Cabinet decided that  The President of theBoard of Education,with the President of the Board of Tradeand the Minister of Labour,  should re-draftthe Paper in the sense of the above dis-cussion olitehall Gardens, S.W.I.,August 11.  1919,-9-
