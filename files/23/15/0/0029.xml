Civil Supplies to the PrimeMinist erG.T.7946Note by the Secretary,  War Cabinet coveringc or r esp ond ene eG.T.7950The PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE said that at firsthe had been in favour of getting rid completely of Haycontrol but had changed his mind on further examinationof the facts.       His attention had been drawn to the matterby the Pood Controller on the 27th June and he hadconsulted the nay Council and had come to the conclusionthat the present condition was extremely dangerous.There was a great shortage in England and Pales.      Therehad been much difficulty in supplying the Welsh pits andthe large towns, the transport system was disorganisedand there were no normal trade routes from Scotland orIreland, and on some farms in England there was an actualshortage.       - He wished the Government to be in controlof a certain amount of hay which could be sent about thecountry as required.      Without some such safeguard, priceswould rise to most abnormal heights.      It was most desirablenot to be forced to import hay from abroad owing to the
exchange situation and while it might become necessary tofix maximum prices and even to commandeer stocks he hopedthese measures could be long postponed.The Secretary for Scotland and the Parliamentary Secretaryto the BOard Of Agriculture both agreed that the fixing ofmaximum prices might become necessary.      In the meantime allhe wished was power to buy within the bnited kingdom.THE POOB CONTROLLER said that his Department was interestedbecause of the reaction of a high price of hay on the pricesof meat and milk.      He wished it were possible to fix amaximum price for hay not exceeding  12 per ton.    There wererumours of hay changing hands at present at  16.      He had beenurged by his advisers and by some farmers that hay ought to becontrolled at all stages.    &quot;There was no doubt that the milk,situation next winter would be very grave and he was certainthat the steps proposed by the President of the Board of Tradewere the minimum required for safety.THE MIBISTER OP MUMITIOHS urged that the policy proposedwould not increase the amount of hay in the country, that lesshay would be required in future by the army and that there wasa surplus of hay in Ireland which could be drawn upon.SIR ARTHUR BOSOOWEN stated that he had no objection to amaximum price being fixed if later on competitive prices soaredto a high level.      At a very high level there would be a greattemptation to farmers to denude their farms and to damagethe meat and milk supply.        He was opposed to commandeeringunder any circumstances.      Parmers had had experience in thepast of having their hay commandeered at  8 and then beingforced to buy at  12.      This had led to great discontent.    Itwas true that the present crop was short and was less than thetotal amount left on the farms last year but to some extentfarmers could economise by substituting straw for hay.    It wasdesirable to give the farmers a definite assurance that tbere
would be no commandeering.&apos;   If you commandeer hay at from 8 to  12 you would be forced to control other feeding stuffsbecause they were dearer.THE LORD ADVOCATE stated that his advisers were againsta policy of maximum prices and indeed against control at all.The shortage was due to drought and to this farmers wereexposed in any event and it was no new experience.    He did notsee how the transport difficulties would be removed under theplan of the President of the Board of Trade.      Purchases bythe Government would inevitably sent up the level of pricesand he was not convinced that at this stage any action wasnecessary.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER confessed that he hadchanged his mind as a result of the arguments advanced by thePresident of the Board of Trade.      Had&apos; it been proposed toimport hay his objection would have remained.      The proposalnow was to pool a supply of hay which could be drawn-upon toassist a vital industry beset by abnormal conditions.    Themoney would be wholly spent in this country and on that under-standing he was willing to withdraw his objections.THE PRESIDENT OB THE BOARD OE EDUCATION thought that ifthe Government undertook the purchase of hai( in order todistribute according to need the Government&apos;would find them-selves involved in a system of rationing.    It would mean aminute enquiry into the stocks of each farmer.      In view ofthe fact that the surface of criticism to which the Governmentwas already exposed was so wide there should be the greatesthesitation in embarking on a new measure of control.MR BONAR LAW said that much as he disliked control it wasobvious that owing to the shortage the country would be facedwith some of the disagreable features of monopoly conditionsand it was not unreasonable, therefore, that the Governmentshould anticipate these conditions and take steps to protectthe country.    In as much as any active purchase by the
(4)254Government would, tend at once to raise the price any Governmentshould be conducted in the most secret fashion and purchaseshe made through ordinary trade channels.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE stated that possiblya sum of  2,000,000 was involved and he undertook that if itbecame necessary to fix prices at a later stage the variousdepartments concerned would be consulted in advance.The War Cabinet decided:-(l)  To authorise the President of the Board of Tradeto take steps to purchase hay on behalf of theGovernment.(2) That at the present stage there would be nofixing of maximum prices and in reply to questionsin the House it should be stated that theGovernment had at present no intention of command-eering hay and that they hoped that such a policywould not become necessary.(3)  That the record of this  secret discussion shouldbe kept by the Secretary and should not becirculated in the form of Minutes,2 Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.August 13th 1919
