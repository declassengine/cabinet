-Mais st yjls.. Gavgrjaasat.. -) &quot;WAR CABINET 608 A.DRAFT MINUTES of a Meeting held in Mr Bonar Law&apos;3 Room,Hoo.se of Commons-, SAY., on THURSDAY, AUGUST 7, 1919, at5-30 p.m.&amp;NALISA-OP THE(1)    Pith reference to &apos;7a.r Cabinet 607 A, the PrimeMinister said that he had been much impressed with thepractical character of the discussion at the Cabinet thatmorning.    He was struck with the overwhelming oppositionto the policy of the State buying out the private interest-in the mines.    What the miners wanted was an elimination   iof private interest from the mining Industry, and he hadconsiderable sympathy with their point of vie1&quot;.    Since hisreturn from France he had been able to give the matter closeattention,  and there were two or three considerations whichhad impelled him to change his standpoint.    On reading someof the evidence given before the  Commission, and all theReports, he cane to the conclusion that no case had beenmade out for nationalisation in the sense in which he hadjust interpreted that term.    The advocates of nationalisa-tion on the commission had done all they could to prejudicetheir case.    Up to the publication of their first Reportthev Md&quot;done well, hut afterwards their conduct of theproceedings had. alienated public  opinion.      The change theadvocates of nationalisation proposed was a very great one,and,  he thought, they had failed, to convince the public.In the second place,  as the lord Chancellor had.-pointed&apos;&quot; out&apos;that morning, the vast majority of the UnionistMembers of Parliament ^ere awainst it,  and among a body ofsome 16 or 13 Liberal Members,with whom he had discussedthe question, he had only found one Member in-favour, andIS E C   R E T -
that Member attached the vital condition that under nation-alisation the miners were to surrender their right to strike.Under these conditions it was impossible to attempt to carryout nationalisation in the present Parliament;    and even ifit were admitted that the present Parliament was reactionary,he was doubtful if,  on an appeal to the country,  a majoritywould be returned in favour of nationalisation.    The minershad made themselves exceedingly unpopular during the lastyear or two by their unreasonable demands and by their re-duct ion of output without regard to the safety of thecountry.    In passing,  he would like to mate it quite clear,with reference to a statement made that morning,  that he hadnever committed himself to the acceptance of the Report ofthe Commission in advance.    Mo Government could pledge itselfin advance without any regard to what the recommendationsof a Commission might-be.The Prime Minister said that he would now proceed toconsider what positive - steps the Government could take.His colleagues were apparently unanimous in agreeing withall the Commissioners that the minerals ought to be nation-alised.    In this respect a- business case had been made out.The fact that coalowners had to negotiate with severallandowners added considerably to their difficulties, andsometimes hindered the most economical working of the mines.He would like to attach to the purchase of the mineralsseme sort of levy upon the compensation to be paid,, whichshould not free the owners of the minerals from.the obliga-tion to improve the social conditions of the miners-.    Thatwas a point he would like the Cabinet to discuss separately.The Prime Minister,  continuing,  said that Sir AucklandGeddes had suggested that any announcement as to thenationalisation of the mines should be deferred until theGovernment load held an. expert enquiry into the best methodof control and management.    Against this, Mr Bonar Law hadurged with great force that it would give the impressionthat the&apos;Government was unable to make up its mind;
confidence would be weakened in the country, and the minerswould think that they were being tricked.    He entirely agreedwith Mr Sonar Law.    7e ought definitely to state that wedid not think a case for the purchase of the mines had beenmade out,  and that in the present financial conditions suchpurchase would add to the burdens of the State other burdensit would be impossible to bear.    That argument should bepublicly stated, as it would mean that we did not  rule outnationalisation for ever.    :?e were opposed to it on businessgrounds,  and especially opposed to it at present because itwould so increase our burdens as to destroy public credit.In the third place, in his opinion, the Governmentought to say emphatically that they were in favour of achange, and that they accepted the criticisms of the Commis-sion upon the present methods of operating and controllingthe mines,    We ought to say that there was not sufficientconsultation with the miners, whose lives were involved,and that means must be devised for ensuring their co-cperatubr.in the working of the mines,    The granting of this powerwould have to be carefully worded, so as to avoid the sug-ges+ion that the control of the particular mine was beinghanded over to the men.    Pit Committees should be set up.Such Committees had been a great success in some places inthis country and in Germany,- and they were being favourablyconsidered in Prance.    They mould be consultative andad-v-lsbry bodies, which would give the workers an o poo rt unit yof placing their views before the managers in regard toquestions of safety and the economical working of the pit.The owners would,  he believed,  agree to this proposal.vfe should also say that we we ?e in general agreementwith the recommendation of most of the Commissioners infavour of amalgamating neighbouring mines in groups,  inorder to reduce working expenses - and secure economies gen-erally.      He himself would go further,* and say that whenthese area groups had been formed, the miners should have ,a-5-
direct voice in the control.    They should he represented onthe body controlling the combination in a particular area.This,  of course,  was quite distinct from the Pit  Committees.Cn the Boards of Control tho miners&apos;  representatives shouldhave exactly the same status as other members of the Board.To this proposal also,  he thought, the mine-owners wouldagree.    On these Boards of Control it would also be verydesirable to have tho consumers of coal represented.&apos;(Paper G.-258)In his Memorandum; Lord Gainford had suggested thatthe application of compulsion to secure unification shouldbe deferred for a period of four years,   so as to allow timefor voluntary amalgamations to be arranged.    He (The PrimeMinister) thought four years too long, as the districts couldproceed simultaneously with their schemes of unification.Two years, at the outside,  should be ample, and then compul-sion could be set in force.    He would give the Board ofTrade,  or the Hose Office, a power to veto any particularscheme cf amalgamation, as some schemes might be clearlydetrimental to the public interest.    The coalowners mightamalgamate to put up prices against the manufacturers,  orthey might combine with the miners against the consumersgenerally.    This power of veto was important.The Minister of Transport interposed that the ooal-0wre&quot;S at ore sent practically combined to fix -prices, -certainly when tendering to the Railway Companies.Mr Bonar law pointed out that it was comparativelyeasy to work price combinations when prices were high, butnot when prices were falling.The President of the Board of Trade said there was agood deal to be said against the Government committing itsolto details of policy;    the:1 should rather confine themselvesto general principles.The Prime Minister,  continuing,  said thatthey could not commit the...selves to a change in conditionson the lines of giving the greatest say to the miners onquestions  of safety and participation in control in wide
areas, and could add that they were not in a position atpresent to place before the House the precise methods bywhich these proposals could be carried out.    It could beannounced that the Government proposed to consult expertswith a view to giving effect to them.Tu sum up, the Government should declare:-(i) That it was in favour of nationalisingminerals:(ii) That it was opposed to State purchaseand State ma nag e raent:(iii) That it was in favour of important changesin the present methods of carrying on theindustry,  on the lines he had. just indi-cated.The Minister of Labour, in reply to the Prime iiinider,stated that the reason ?*hy an enquiry into the diminution ofoutput - as recommended by the Commission - had not beenheld, was that everybody was waiting to know what line theGovernment was going to take on the larger question of generalpolicy.The p&quot;ue Minister stated that the diminution wag wide-ly attributed to want of tubs, wagons and material.    If thiswas true, and to the extent that it was true, it ought to beput right.    Until these legitimate grounds of Complaint wereremoved,  the miners would be able to confuse the issue andto influence the public to a degree out of all proportion tothe grievance.   There was the further belief that,- underpresent conditions, the mine-owners themselves were not verykeen on increasing output, and it wag alleged that they wereusing labour in ways which might help them later on, when,as they hoped, control had been removed and the Excess ProfitTax abolished.Mr Bonar Law stated that the guaranteed profit- tothe    ine-owners was divided up in such a way that there waslittle or no real incentive to these. ,-5-
T--e Minister of Labour explained that the Is .3d. . perton profit was an average figure over the whole coalfield,and it was true that mines making less than Is,3d. had noincentive at all to increase out put.The First  Commissioner of :7orks pointed out that,owing to the far,  repair sort and the opening un of newseams had inevitably been postponed, and that additionallabour was now required for these purposes.The Prime LSinister,  in reply to a question on theGovernment&apos;s general policy,  stated that he was in favour-ofsee limitation of profits, but he would not deprive, themine-owners and managers of all incentive to energetic effort-.The precise degree and method of limitation was a subjectfor consultation with the experts.The President of the Board of Trade said that it wasvery difficult to provide for the proper development of theindustry under a scheme of limitation of profits.The Secretary of State  for Tar asked wiry the coalindustry should be treated differently in this resoect fromo rdinary b usiness undertakings.Mr Bonar Law replied that if the Government permitted,-and even encouraged,, large amalgamations of mining interestswithout any control of profit, there would be a strongpublic outcry.    Further, the coal industry was the chieffoundation Industry of the country.The First  Commissioner of &quot;Jorks said that one strongobjection to any limitation of profits was the temptationto invest capital abroad under more remunerative conditions.Any scheme of limitation -ould have to be varied to suit thtconditions of the different areas.    For example, a schemeaonlioable to the export trade of South Wales would not atall suit the domestic trade of the Midlands.
-   203The Minister of Health said that, with regard to thepassage in the Prime Minister&apos;s statement relating to theDistrict  Control Hoards, he thought these should be given thepower of fixing the prices of ccal in their own areas.ThePrime Minister pointed cut, however, that theminers and the owners were in the majority on these bodies,and,if the Minister of Health&apos;s suggestion was adopted,  itwould mean putting the control of prices into the hands ofthe two parties most interested in hip profits,   for therewas no douot that,when once the differences between theowners and. the miners we re settled, they would combine andbetween them rob the public.    The mining industry was dif-1 erpn*  -Prom an ordinary business such as shipping,  inasmuchas this country possessed a big natural commodity which itv;aa fortunate enough to find in the earth,  and he thought itwas  only right that the public should have an interest  init.The Secretary of State for -7ar said that he wasalarmed at the words in the Priwe Minister&apos;s statement,&quot;oont ro 1 of pr of it s &quot; .Mr Bonar Law suggested that the following words mightbe used:-    &quot;some for.,  of control to protect the public asregards prices&quot;.Mr Barnes was of the opinion that a great deal dependedon the form in which the Prime Minister&apos;s state, ent -wasissued,   &apos;.nd he would rather it took the nature of an apoealthan a challenge.    For example, he thought it would have beenbetter to use different words from &quot;no case had been madeput for nationalisation&quot;.The Prime Minister said that he would not use theword &quot;nationalisation&quot;, hut would employ the phrase &quot;greatSt ate t ransaction&quot;.The Secretary of State for India said he hoped that tc auch stress.would not be    ade of the point that to purchasethe jjines was bad finance,  for he could not see,  in his ctn;mind, why,  if the owners could make a profit out of the coal-7-
1ndust ry, t h e St a t e sho uld no t .The Secretary of State for the Colonies said he agreedwith Mr Montagu and could not  follow the argu ent that it wasnecessary to raise fresh money in order to purchase themines.    So  long as the new security was a sound one,  and theamount to he taken out of the business was not greater thanbefore, he did not see that the raising of new money wasnecessary.    The Loans which the Government had raised duringthe &apos;-Var were borrowed on the general community;    a loan forthe purchase of the mines would be borrowed on the financialsoundness of the mi nine, industry.The Drime Minister asked which was the mo&quot;e valuablesecurity   the State or the mines?    The security of themines would not add anything to the security of the State,as in raising money to purchase the mines one would be trad-ing on the credit of Great Britain.    Per this reason, he didnot want to choke the country with unnecessary paper when*her- wev* so many other enterprises on hand, for which theState would require to raise loans.The Prime Minister added that he wouldhave his proposed Statement typewrittenand circulated to the Ministers,  so thatthey would have an opportunity of examin-ine. it.Whi t e ha11 Gardens,   3.7.1August 8, 1919.-6
