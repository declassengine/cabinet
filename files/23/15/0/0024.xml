(This Document is the Property of His BritannicMa .i e s t y1 e i G o ve rnment.)EGRET -WAR CABIMET 60? A,DRAFT MI MUTE 3 of a Me e tine held at 10, Downinsr Street, SMW.,on TEEPSDAY, AUGUST 7,  1919,   at  11-30 a.3.mrmmCOAL INDUS-?V FirI.S.(1) &apos;Pith reference to -7ar Cabinet 60S A.., l,c Earnes saidthat he had read all the Papers which had been circulatedrelating to Nationalisation,  and he found that Lord Gainfordwithbad made great play,,ass the figures of the coal industry withregard to the development of coal productionand the number of people employed, but he did not mentionthat the way the industry had been conducted had placed usin our present predicament.    Lord Gainford supported half-heartedly the Duckham proposals, but this Report -did notmeet the present position, and made no provision for thelimitation of profits, although it set up capitalist eoro-bines.    The Duc&amp;ham Report also did not meet the men&apos;s ob-Section of having to work for private profit.    The Governmenthaving set up the Sankey Co..mission, was placed in an avyjevardsituation, as the Chai^an Mad reported in favour of somesystem of nationalisation.    Fie (Mr Barnes) felt that theGovernment was bound to carry out some experiment in thenature of nationalisation.    Pie understood that the proposalto nationalise one coalfield as an experiment had been turneddown owing to the fact that it would have the effect ofmabine the miners in other areas disinclined to work.The Secretary of State for the Colonies interposedthat it had been suggested by Mr Justice Sankey thatnationalisation should be applied to the Yorkshire area,and the Miners were prepared to accept this proposal , but
the owners had turned it. down on the ground that the minersin Yorkshire would work hard in order to make the experimenta success, and the miners in other collieries would slack.kr Barnes said that he was inclined to adopt theLlewellyn-S...ith scheme.    He admitted that the Government wasin a difficult situation,  but this justified them in takinggreat risks.    The only alternative he saw to adopting theLI ewellyr.-Smith scheme was to call another conference ofmine-owners and employees, to agree upon some modificationof the ikuckham scheme.    Pith regard to wages, all partieshad more or less agreed to some scheme of bonus, but it hadnot been intimated as to how this bonus should be paid.Ps-sonallv, he would not agree to an individual bonus beingpaid.    There was a system of bonus on collectiveoutput,- which had proved Valuable during the War.    Thissystem of bonuses on collective output had the effect ofinducing every man to see that his neighbour did his best.There was then the question as to &quot;rho should adjust wages.If it was possible, he would like to go back to the oldsystem, when the Ministry of Labour dealt with this question,but he feared that it was now too late for that.    He thought,therefore, that the best method would be to set up a specialConference to discuss scheme?of wages.   Toconclude,  be wan in favour of adopting the Llewellyn-3;itho^ooosals re^a^dinsr Nationalisation.The Secretary cf State for war said that he could notpretend to have studied the detail of this question, but onbroad lines he thought it was fair to say  that the public wasprepared for the nationalisation of railways out was notprepared for &quot;he nationalisation nf mines.    He did not thinkthat Parliament would agree to the latter.    The question hadnot been examined by the nation as a whole, and, apart fromthe merits of the question, the General - lection had giventhe Government no mandate to deal with it.    The presentParliament was not entitled to deal with the question of
na tionalisation.The other aspect of the questionwas that public opinion had turned, against the miners.    Theminers had been given priority oP release fro::; the Army inorder to increase the coal output, but the only result  ofthis had been that the  output had been held up by a constantsuccession of disputes.    Pn political grounds the Governmentwould be well-advised not to allow this big political ogues-tion to be forced upon them.As for tho merits of nationalisation, he thought itsadvocates had made out no case at all. The facts containedin the first part of the fuokham Report represented theHe was of opinion, however,  that it would be wrong to meetthe question of nationalisation with a direct&apos;negative, andhe thought that the policy of the Government lay in a corn-promise between the G-a inferd and Duckham proposals.    Ifsoma of the owners disagreed with this course it would placethe Government in the middle position, which it ought tooccupy.    He would pronounce clearly against nationalisation,and put forward a policy based on the Duckha .. and Gainfordproposals.    This view had been borne in upon him, althoughhe was not opposed to nationalisation in principle.was the only member of the Government who had made a speechat the General Election against nationalisation.    He thoughtthe results to the country of nationalisation would bedisastrous.    In Germany; where a Socialist Government wasin powo-,  Herr Wissell, the Minister of Economics.,- hadsaid that Germany had&apos;found it impossible to nationalise themines.    The experiment had been tried some years aro, butthe  results were so disastrous that, after five years,they had been forced to hand back the. mines to the owners.Germany had found that nationalisation led to less workma s scountry at the present time.Eli e Fi r s t Co mm i s s i o ne r of   &apos; o rks said he thought he
toand demand? by the miners being made on the Governmentwhich would ne^er have been made on private owners.   MrJustice Sankey had said that people worked bettor for theState.    Facts had proved this statement to be untrue.    Inhis (Sir Alfred Mond?s) opinion the great mass of the minerswere not interested in this question, but only in wages andhours, and in some of the South Wales districts the minershad pronounced against nationalisation.    There was a furtherpoint, the financial aspect.    There was no doubt that therecould not be a worse time than the present at which to pur-chase the mines.    The finances of the country vr^^e not onlyweak, but the currency was de-valued.    The coalcwners woulddo &quot;-ell * o sell at t he present tine, as the State would paythem twice as much as in normal times,  owing to the decreasein the value of the sovereign.      In reply to a question,Sir Alfred Mond stated that, although the-e was no Stateownership of mines in Germany, there was State ownership ofminerals.    He added that the Duokham Report went a long waytowards a practical nropoeal, and he thought it would be anadvantage if the smaller collieries, which were wasteful intheir working, could be amalgamated.The Minister of Labour said that the present Germanscheme for dealino with the mines was something on the linesof Sir Hubert Llewellyn-Smith&apos;s proposals, with this greatdifference,  that the Germans did not propose to buy out theowners.The Secretary of State for India a sited whether SirAlfred Mond would limit profits.The First Commissioner of 7orks replied in the affirm-ative.The Secretary of State for India said that, if theprofits of the owners were net limited, the great grievanceof the mine&quot;s would remain, although if profi+s were limitedit would result in the absence of an incentive, on the partof the owners, to do their best.   With regard to the
Secretary of State for &apos;7&apos;arrs remarks as to the competence ofthis Parliament to -deal with the question of nationalisation,he thought they came rather late in the day.    If the Govern-ment did not feel competent to deal with this question theyshould not have appointed the Sankey Commission.    Having gotover an immediate difficulty by appointing this Commission,the throwin? over of its recommendations and the adoptionof the Report of Sir Arthur Duokham, who was in a minorityof one, would be followed, by very serious consequences.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was op-posed to nationalisation for some reasons which would appeal* o all his colleagues, and for other reasons which appealedto him in his capacity ao Finance Minister.    He was alarmedat the effects on our oolitical institutionswhich were takingplace ao a result  of the War.    There was a mass of pensionerswho had .?. direct pecuniary interest in the State.    In additionthe vast housing and land settlement schemes which it wasproposed to carry into effect would result in a large numberop peoole beirm subsidised as owners of houses and occupiersof land.    It would be a great temptation to these peopleand the pensioners to use their political vote selfishly.The railway employees were practically e ployees of the State,inasmuch as they were not working for private enterprise,and if the mines were now nationalised it would add anothervast section of the population who were not only voters butwould beco e direct servants of the State.    One of ourproblems     howgreatesthdasopersj was /to adjust private interests to thewelfare of the State.    His second point was that it wasassumed that people worked, better for the State than forprivate enterpriser but he could see no evidence among the/anewer class of State servants, who had not/ long traditionbehind them, that they would refrain from strikes and wouldput forward greater efforts on behalf of the State.    The.motive of these people was to do less work, and that was why
they wanted nationalisation.    If there were included in ourState servants people working in industrial undertakings, itsight have a bad effect on the older State  servants who wereemployed in the Dockyards, the Arsenal, the Post Office, etc.-Tith regard to the effect of nationalisation on the financialsituation -  and he-would like what he was going to say notto be re-arded as anything in the nature of a threat   hecould not take on his shoulders a huge purchase of this kind.He simply would not dare to do it.    It would be impossibleto buy out the owners in cash, and the only way of dealingwith the vast interests involved would be to force the ownersto take stock.    If loans were floated, it would not be possi-ble to get the money, and, the result of a forced issue tothe present owners would be that they wool: sell and thestock would be at a discount.    In addition, the result onthe ability of the Government to borrow for other purposeswould he very bad. He was confronted with the problem of howto raise money for the Government programme.    The result ofthe rays and Communications Bill might be that the Governmentwould have to issue a stock&apos;of over  70,000,000 for thepurchase of railway wagons alone;    and if the housing policyof the Government proceeded as fast as was desired,  somehundreds of millions would have to be raised in the country,though no&quot;&quot;, all of this by the State, as some would be raisedby Local Authorities.    The Minister of Health was beset byLocal Authorities who did not want to borrow at the ratesthey had to offer.    They were afraid of their credit.    TheGovernment slight come to a point- where they would have togive an interest on loans the high rate of which mightfrifhten the investor.    It was not possible to contemplatea forced issue of stock for the purchase of the mines,- andif he thought it was possible to avoid the. purchase ofroyalties he would do it* in view of the country&apos;s immensefloating debt,
The Postmaster-General said that he had had a gooddeal of excellence of people working both for the Stateand for private enterprise,  and he said without hesitationthat people worked better for private enterprise than theyI did for the State.    His experience at the Post Office wasthat there was more discontent and less desire to workthere than in private employment.The Lord Chancellor said, that the temper of theCabinet was overwhelmingly against nationalisation.    TheSecretary of State for India had truly said that by appoint-ing the Sankey Commission we assumed Parliamentary corapet-ence to deal with the question; but when the Sankey Commls-aion was appointed the Government was in a difficult posi-tion, *r.d. he thought no-one undertook that we were boundby any conclusions reached by the Commission.   tfe&apos; werebound- however, to examine the Commission&apos;3 conclusions,but&apos; he would point out that there was no sort of unanimityamong the recommendations, and when he examined the reasonsput forward by kr Justice Sankey in favour of nationalisa-t ion, they produced no impression on his mind., Nothing, inhis opinion,  had been said by those in favour of national-isatlbn that would warrant the conclusion that the adoptionof this policy would be followed by increased production.He kept sufficiently in touch with the Unionist Party to becertain that they would not follow if the Government decidedto nationalise the mines.   -Such a scheme would never getthrouph the House of Commons,- and even if it did obtain a.s...-all\-dragconed majority in favour of nationalisation, whenit reached the House of Lords that House would know that thequestion had been over-helmingly opposed in the Lower House,,and by making proposals of this kind the Government wereant adonis Ins? the whole of the commercial world.    He verymuch doubted, in view of this, if the House of Lords wouldpass a Bill to nationalise the-mines...  A short while ago hehad been a. guest at a dinner of the Liverpool Chamber of
Commerce, and there was not one man who had attended this &quot; *function who was not opposed to nationa.lhse.tion and thoughtthe adoption of such a policy would end in national^dis-ast-er..tflth regard to the Secretary of State for India&apos; s remarks onthe Duo sham Report, it was true that this was an individualtheReport in the sense that,at kkkk time it was written, SirArthur Duckharfs colleagues did not agre,e with it, but nowthe employers might be inclined to modify their attitude andadvance a long way towards Si*&apos; Arthur Duckham&apos;s proposals.-The Minister of Health said that, with regard to theremarks which had been made as to tha competence of theGovernment to deal with the subject of nationalisation, he wa3of opinion that the Government was sufficiently competent todeal with such an issue,    He was not persuaded that the expe-riencs of the Tar shoved that people would not work as wellfor the State as .for private enterprise.    At the same time,the Sankey Report showed that private management was not anunadulterated success, and he thought that private owner&amp;hiphad not shone in the evidence.    He agreed, however, that,from a political point of view, it would not be- possible topass through the present parliament a Bill for *he^mtd^rwJ?-wisa&quot; ion of mines..
l$garrW.c- int^restir were J.jwelvedand any eche-c rertlug solely on private interests suchas proposed In the Duekham report would get the situationInto worse turmoil than at present,, and was reallyunthinkablea   He was of opinion that the ease for nation-allsationy&amp;s\ far from proved^ and was in favour of ex*ploring further the suggestion of the First Commissionerof Works$ * that was, on the lines of a Company workingUnder a limitation of profits with district controlsThe Prime Minister pointed out that Lord 0atnford*ssuggestion was that four years should be allowed foramalgamationj, and that then compulsion should be resortedto if necessary.   By this means the negotiations forforming companies would be carried out tinder the shadowOf compulsion.   Otherwisetdifficulties would arise onaccount of the parties interested standing out In orderto get bettor terms,Dva Addlson, continuing, said there was one otherpoint, and that was that Lord Gainford&apos; s proposals wouldneither satisfy the miners or the public6   He would suggestadopting the Duckham suggestions In principlesThe Prime Minister pointed out that Lord Gainford*sproposals did not really turn down those in the Duckhamreports   Lord Gainford&apos;s proposal was that It should beleft to the companiesp and the State should come In after-war d.s if they failed *   Both were In favour of compulsionat some time&apos;or other...... was .Dr, Addis on. continuing, said his points/that thereshould be some board of control operating on behalf ofthe States    Such an arrangement would, in his opinion,go far towards removing the objections raised to theDuckham proposals.The President of the Board of Trade reminded theCabinet of the unsatisfactory position of trade at thesaidmoment, and^that something must be fone at once^   For
the week ending the 16th July oim imports had been toour exports In the proportion of 141 to 65, and coalwas down to the extent of 772,000 tons,,   The fall inthe amount of coal was due to sevex^al causes - partlythe Yorkshire strike and partly the reduction in workingtime ; and to a general feeling of unrest which wasresulting in various meetings being held and the menabsenting themselves from the mines.   At the presentrate our trade balance would be against us to theextent of  900,000,000 a year. . .The output of coalhad dropped beloir our worst anticipations and theGovernment must do something during the next month.He was personally against nationalisation ofmines., /It would, in his opinion, lead us into inter-national troubles,.and for that reason alone he thoughtthe State would have to avoid It.,. The only possibleline we could: take at present was to try the Gainfordor Duckham proposals, but he was not sure that thatwould not put us into.a worse state than at present.He would, suggest an Immediate- announcement to- the effectthat minerals would be nationalised, and that as regardsthe bigger question, the Government felt that furtherInvestigation was reouired, .He would point out thata great deal of subjects.had to be  explored, and hewould say that the Government had fully considered theSankey report and felt that it would not be altogethercomplete without further investigation, and that theyproposed to- appoint a Commission on which the workingminers and possibly, if they liked, their trade unionofficials,....the mine managers, tho owners, the Governmentand also experts in our foreign trade relations &quot;would berepresented... He would be inclined to set this Commissionto prepare a scheme&apos; and to educate each other from thedifferent points of view. . Further, he would have theirreports printed and circulated, as the miners were very
ignorant as to the real situation.    He would be ratherafraid of making a definite statement now regardingnationalisation.   He was not very clear how the Duckhamproposals would work out, even with limitation ofprofits.    The interest of the State was so great thathe thought in any case tho Government would be forcedto have a Commission which would control the working ofthe nines, and the ultimate responsibility would rest onthe Gov e rnme-ut.The President of the Board of Education said thathe agreed with his colleagues as  regards the question ofnationalisation.    If, however,, the suggestion of the &apos;President of tho Board, of Trade was accepted, he wouldlike to add to the announcement which he proposed.     Thecountry was very greatly interested now in the Coal question.He entirely agreed with the Lord Chancellor that any announce-ment that the Government were in favour of nationalisationwould cau.se great anxiety.     At the same time he thought thecountry had been now fully convinced that there were greatdeficiencies in the existing management of the coal mines,and that tho housing conditions were not satisfactory.     Theminers fear^ profiteering and their claim for a larger sharein the control had also to be taken into consideration,,      Therewas further the question of protecting the consumers interests.He would therefore like to add to the announcement proposedby the president of the Board of Trade something to show whatthe Government considered to be the cardinal conditions of awell organised scheme, and he would like to state that anyitscheme which the Government decided on would meet theseconditions-.     For example, he would say that It was recognisedthat more provision must be made for the welfare of the minersthemselves, for stopping profiteering, for giving the miners
a larger1 share In the control, and for protecting the con-sumers interests *The Secretary of State for the Colonies hoped thatthe Cabinet would not. at that stage commit themselvesagsinst nationalisations .    He agreed wi?th i.&apos;hat had beer-said by the Presidents of the Board of Trade and the g0ardof Education.      It would in his opinion be disastrous atthat stage to take any decisive line except as regardsthe nationalisation of minerals,      Ke was convinced thattho     iC&apos;ountr(,    was marching against private ownership notonly in minerals but also In the mines themselves.      Ifthe Government were to say definitely that they wore againstnationalisation the announcement would be popular in theHouse of Commons, and even more so in the House of Lords,but in his opinion it would produce a crisis in the countryand would have a disastrous effect on trade generally,. andtho already serious situation in this respect had beenreferred to by the President of tho Bo&amp;rd of Trades     Hefelt very strongly that tho real alternatives to completeGovernment ownership and control had not been very fullyconsidered.     The Chancellor of the Exchequer had arguedthe ca.se as if nationalisation could only meanthe mines being administered by a huge Governmentoartment, and he  did not think that anyone wouldsuggest that such an arrangement was desirable.     He wasgenerally inclined to favour Sir Hubert Llewellyn Smith1sproposals.    The  scheme which appeard to him most attractivewas the proposal to run the mines in the different districts-on tho co-operative principle.    That was, the mines wouldbe controlled by Corporations who would work for their ownbenefit subject to State supervision.The Prime Minister suggested that the proposal madoby the Secretary of State for the Colonies was very nearly
the same as that made in the Duckham ReporteThe Secretary of State for the Colonies continuing,said he would not like to commit himself to the Duckhamproposals...    Re thought that Sir Hubert Llewellyn Smith Jscriticism of these proposals was sound.      If the Governmentdeclared now definitely against nationalisation it wouldbe, in his opinion, prejuo^Lcss    the situation.    He thoughteveryone was against running tlx 3 mines as one business*The people who were in favour of nationalisation werethose who felt that tho working of the mines for privateprofit was a failureThe Prime Minister suggested that unlimited privateprofit would more accurately describe the situation.The Secretary of State for the Colonies agreed thatthis was so to a certain extents,    The interests of theowners were already very limited0Sir Eric Geddes pointed out that in addition totheir profits being limited the owners also had a guaran-tee 0The Prime Minister pointed out that with profitslimited and also a guarantee all incentive was doneaway with.     He suggested that the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies contemplated some sort of ex-approprla-tion of the mines.The Secretary of State for the Colonies agreed, butdid not think that this should be done by running up ahuge debt ,3The Prime Minister suggested that it would come tothe same thing in the long run.The Secretary of State for Ear was of opinion thatsuch an arrangement would result in the same argumentsaS had been used In the case of royalties.    Tv,e minerswould at once call attention to the large charges whichhad to be paid to the owners *
The Secretary of State for the Colonies continuing,said the owners must be compensated in some way.   Hethought however that charges might be made terminableand might be in the form of an annuity plus a sinkingfund to extinguish the charge altogether after a certainterm.      Under existing conditions there was no incentivect u  all.The Chancellor of the Exchequer raised the questionas to where the capital for the future development ofthe mines was to be foundsThe Secretary of State, for the Colonies continuing,said what he :r anted really was to have all the differentpoints of view thoroughly discussed,,     He himself wasonly feeling his way and it was quite possible for anyoneto put arguments to him which- he had not time fully toconsider.   Ho was not then suggesting any definite planbut he was confident that it was only by following suchlines as he had suggested that a solution could be found.He agreed that the present situation was hopeless, buthe thought that a declaration at the present time infavour of any definite scheme would be a mistake and hewould prefer merely to say on. what points the Cablnetwere agreed, and to say that they were &quot;working out ascheme on certain general linos which would be indicated.Mr, Bonar Law was of opinion that the question wasvery urgent and unless a definite announcement was madebefore the House rose, the present agitation and feelingof unrest would continue.    The miners and mine ownersat the present time had very little interest in increasingthe output and. if a definite decision v-^as left untillater this unsatisfactory situation would continue.      Ifthere was going, to be a strike he suggested that there was
to be saida good dooj/ for clearly laying down now what tho policywas to be.      Some people wore of opinion that if theGovernment clearly stated now their policy there mightbo a goof deal of murmurings and criticism, but therewould be no strike.      Ho, Mr. Bonar Lav/, was convincedthat the appointment of another Commission would boregarded as playing with the question,     While agreeingthat there wore great difficulties in coming to ani3mao0.ia.te conclusion, ho was of opinion that it would bebetter to cay definitely at once that minerals would benationalised3 but not the mines themselves *     At thosame time tho Government might announce that thoy roal-ised that.something must be done to improve the existingconditions and that they proposed using the recess forconsidering the question.   -The Minister of Labour1 said that ho had discussedthe question with a good many people and he was perfectlycertain that if no definite announcement as to theGovernment&apos;s future policy was made now, it would putthe country into jeopardy.    The confidence of the country iIn the Government had already been weakened and if nodefinite announcement was mo.de this situation would be-come worse and the country would bo suspicious,   - Thpunrest amongst the miners would increase and the outputwould be oven worse.    He did not agree with those whohad told Mr. Bonar Lav/ that there would be no strike eventhough the Government declared definitely now againstnationalisation.     Ho would like to ask, however, if therewere going to be a strike would not this be the host timefor It, He Mas in favour however of. announcing     atthe same time that the Government proposed to have aninquiry, and generally indicating tho lines on which they
considered any satisfactory scheme should bo based?He added, in reply to a question by the Secretary ofState for India, that ho was not in favour of eitherof the proposals In either the Gainford or DuckhamReportso J//
The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he was gladthat the &quot;ar Cald.net appeared to be generally agreed thattho nationalisation of mines vras Impracticable.      Had theyarrived at any other decision it would have been repudiatedin Parliament and in the country.      Fe thought, however, theGovernment ought to make known their views at once and statedefinitely that the:/ wore opposed to nationalisation;    other-wise they would once more be accused of not being able tomake up their own minds.The Minister of Health enquired whether the Ministerof Labour would in his proposed statement indicate whetherIt was Intended to nut forward any other scheme.The Minister of Labour replied, that he thought thatthe Government must certainly say that he proposed to pro-duce an alternative scheme.       . ..Sir   fVic -0*Sdtes. thought that no case had beenmade out for nationalisation^      Any district control ofcoal would not be a success because the district interestwas nob the national Interest.      He himself was not infavour of the scheme propounded by Sir Arthur Duckham ashe thought that It &quot;was artificial in Its character.     Heagreed that the present was not the time to nationalisethe min.es but he advised his colleagues not to commit them-selves finally aginst nationalisation in the future.    Thequestion should be left open for further consideration.The Chancellor of the htuchequer expressed, the hopethat If any declaration was made,  the objects should notbe stated in the order given by tho Minister of Mducationwho placed the Interest of the consumer last,      He himselfinwould suggest that/the declaration should be placed firstnot the mines  or the question of better conditions, but thenational interest.The Shipping Controller said that the country to-daywas thoroughly unsettled and any further delay on the part
of the Government in announcing the policy would havea serious effect.      Personally, he was much troubled bythe state of our foreign trade *      Before the war weshinned abroad BO million tons of coal a year;    to-daywe were exporting practically no coal at all,      A largeproportion of profit made by the country generally camefrom our foreign trade,.&apos;    Co far as shipping was concerned,we made far more by our foreign than by our home trade.One of the great difficulties in the way of nationalisationof coal mines was the ramifications of the coal trade,which of course extended abroad,Tho food Controller said, that the problem was  socomplex that the Government must necessarily exercisegreat caution in handling it.      He hi.rn.self in the pasthad generally advocated nationalisation with this reser-vation, however, that on account of the complicationsintroduced by foreign trade, he had always doubted whethernationalisation in the case of coal mines &quot;would bepracticable and wise.      There was, however, a strong feel-ing in the mining districts that the Government were commit-ed to adopt the recommendations of the Sankey Report, andthis was having a big moral effect throughout the country;Mr. fames confirmed Mr&apos;. Roberts view that this ideawas generally prevalent&apos;.The Prime Minister said that he himself could notbe held responsible for this idea.      All he had said inregard, to the Sankey Re/oort was that it was a valv.10.bledocument which would be carefully considered by H,M,Government,Mr, Barnes thought that a misconception had arisenafter Mr. Bonar haw1s statement in Parliament on the 20thMarch, and steps should be taken to remove it.Mr. Bonar Law thought that the idea that the Government
intended to adopt the Sankey Report was based on his ownpromise to deal with the Interim Reports,The Secretary of State for the Colonies said thataccording to his recollections &quot;all Mr, Bonar Law had donewas to speak in favourable terms of that part of theReport which contained a sweeping condemnation of thepresent system.The Food Controller said that there was undoubtedlya strong feeling on the subjects     The unquestioned fail-vire of the existing system had much to do with it.      Hisrecent experience had been that men did not as a rulework better In Government than they did in private employ.He believed, however, that forces were operating in thecountry which would eventually drive the Government toadopt nationalisation.    He did not think that the Minors 1Federation would swing to the support of the Yorkshiremen,The real danger would come from the Triple Alliance as allsections of labour were now committed to the principle ofnationalisation, and that Is what would rally the miners.There were some useful suggestions put forward in theDuckham and Gainford Reports, but nothing would eradicatefrom the minds of the miners the conviction that theirsalvation lay in nationalisation.     Tie thought there was apossibility, if the &quot;ar Cabinet pronounced against nation-alisatlon, of an organised strike on a huge scale whichwould moan that the whole country would be held up and theGovernment be faced with the alternative either of yieldingor of dissolving Parliament,      The situation was grave Inthe extreme and very little was required to inflame thecountry^     *The Prime Minister enquired, supposing there was a bigstrike and the Government went to the country on the question
of nationalisation and the country decided against it,would the miners then accept the general verdict of thenation9The Pood Controller replied that in the event of thenation definitely deciding against nationalisation, Inhis opinion, the men generally would return to worlcAs he had said, the threat of anything like a generalstrike would necessitate the Government appealing tothe country*     A&apos;Member of the Government had told himlately that he believed that at the next Election thoa Labour Government would be returned to power.      Ifthis, prediction proved accurate, the question of national-isation would be only postponed^     His own impressionwas that the result of nationalisation^ if and whenadopted, would only end In disillusionment, but he bellev-ed that the miners and others would have to go throughthe process and. learn by bitter experience.   They wouldfind out in the long run that you could not continue totake out without putting in.
THE SECRETARY FOR SCOTLAND said that he had no technical knowledge of the question under discussion and for various reasons he had not had time to study the documents. Speaking as an outsider his view was (a) that private ownership in coal had not been a conspicuous success to say the least of it;

(b) the demand for nationalisation was strong, widespread and difficult to resist; and (c), the adoption of nationalisation outright would shake the coal industry and bring disaster. He had, however, before coming to the Cabinet, been inclined to agree with Mr Barnes that it would be best to test the principle of nationalisation over a period of time and a certain area, but after listening to the discussion and the arguments put forward against nationalisation, he confessed he was glad that Mr Bonar Law was suggesting making a declaration to the effect that the War Cabinet were opposed to it. He had returned from Scotland charged with many messages to the Prime Minister, that nationalisation would be fatal.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HOME AFFAIRS said that he had no doubts in his own mind about nationalisation. These views were of long standing and they had been in no wise shaken by anything he had seen in the Sankey Report. The idea was not practicable especially from the point of view of our foreign trade. Present conditions, however, indicated that there was a sad lack of co-ordination, that there was no settled policy, and that the most economical use of coal was not being made. These questions required immediate and close examination. He was in favour of a clear and explicit declaration of the Government&apos;s intention not to adopt the principle of nationalisation. The result might be that the Triple Alliance would strike, but this was a contingency which had to be faced; and if it had to come to a fight, the present was the best time for us. He suggested that the declaration should definitely state that anything like a 
general scheme of natloualiaatIou was out of the question; thehtate might, however, take over, &quot;oy \/ay of e:rperimeht&apos;, the : fewmines there v.;ere in Ireland and chew the miners how to work themIt should fur  her state that the &quot;ove indent v/ere going to takesteps to piece utters on a proper looting, thct is to is ay,there would he more control of the mines and a greater Co- -ordination.     ...11 the reports which had he eh circulated hadtheir good and their bad points..    he suggested that a slid-ing scale of wages, prices and pr.oi.ite should be worked out.The declaration should be made not - later than the followingweek and It should include a statement to the effect that thea &apos;     -Government hod/^definite     schema to propose..THE SECEEiLJxY Ox&apos; hThfE *-CR remarked that, militarily,we were In a. good position to fight the Triple alliance.THE HOME &amp;.ECIiETid&apos;.y said that the Triple alliance wouldcertainly attempt to strike If they found that the Governmentintended to refu.se nationalisation.     He himself doubtedwhether0 supposing an appeeJ, were made to the country and thoverdict of the nation was against nationalisation, the Triplealliance would accept this.     He believed that the presentagitation was not really for nationalisation only but for some-thing much big-gear.THE JeKEfclDSHi OP THE BOhuD OP TIEEDE said he agreed thatwasit ssacESbfetax desirable that &amp;r Eonar law should make a declar-ation so long as It stated that the Government at present wasopposed to anything like a bureaucratic control in any- Industry,e.g*8 the Post Office control of the telephones.   &apos; -In his vietf,however, it would be dangerous for the ..ar Cabinet definitelyand finally to commit themselves against nationalisation in anyform in the future, because in the long run he fancied   somekind of state management was inevitable.     He informed the EarCabinet that in about 60 days time arrangements would be
completed to provide trans-ail antic steamers with bunker oilIf     from kescico.      There were already oil tanks at iiverpool,Glasgow and ^ronmouth.     ..t the back . of all these arrangementswas private enterprise only.     Directly the miners became aware,of this he thought that it would have a great propagandisteffect and might absolutely shake the present feeling among theminers that they had the    country at their mercy.       . strikeby the Triple alliance, among other things, would involvea collapse on the continent as both arance and Italy would bedeprived of our coal,TBH Ihlhh t..lIfIfcj&apos;i2iH said that the immense importance of thedecision which had to he taken by the ..ar Cabinet on thequestion of nationalisation irrclined him to think that thematter required further eonsideration before they could defin-it ely make up their minds.     He suggested that they should nowadjoumt and meet again at 5:30 pvjn. in the room of the leaderof the house at the house of Commons, when the discussion wouldbe resumed.      In the meantime he would be glad to be furnishedby the ministers concerned with a short summary of the proposals(a) &apos;0ir the president of the Board of Trade(b) Oi the ^resident of the   .oard of -Education.The meeting was adjourned at 1:25.3,. Whitehall Gardens    S    ,1..,August 7,. 1919..
