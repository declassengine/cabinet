THE SECRET SERVICE COMMITTEE REPORT.

With reference to War Cabinet 519. Minute 4, the War Cabinet and before them the Report of the Secret Service Committee which they had appointed, under the Chairmanship of Lord Curzon, to enquire (a) what is being done at present by the Secret Service branches of the several Departments: (b) how this word can best be co-ordinated with a view to the necessary action being taken with the utmost promptitude.

The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reminded the War Cabinet that the question now before them arose out of a Memorandum by Mr. Long, calling attention to the urgent need of combating Bolshevism in this country. The Committee which had been appointed to investigate the question had examined the whole system of Secret Services, and had found that the funds disbursed for this purpose to the Admiralty and the War Office had been very profitably employed, and that the two War Departments concerned were now reducing their expenses. The Committes had then examined the methods of collection and dissemination of intelligence by the Home Office; they had found that at the Home Office there was a special branch, in the charge of Mr. Basil Thomson, which was doing excellent work, the results of which were communicated to the Cabinet by means of a fortnightly report submitted by the Home secretary. Mr. Thomson, however, was seriously hampered by the pressure of other duties, of which it Seemed, in the circumstances, desirable that he should be relieved. No machinery existed at present to ensure that action was taken by the Departments concerned on the Reports made by the Home Office; and, further, there appeared to be a certain amount of overlapping and wastage of energy, owing to lack of co-ordination.  The Committee felt that slackness, or lack of promptitude of action, might have serious
59c-results in this country, and had&apos; come to the conclusionthat&apos;a more swift, comprehensive and -powerful machinerythan that whioh fit present existed should&apos; be set up. Theyhad accordingly reccsmended thnt the distinction between icivil and military intelligence should be maintained; that it-would &apos;probably he desirable at the end of the war to co-ordinate all intelligence for Military purposes, and toestablish one&apos; er&amp;anieattpn&apos; which would serve alike the &quot;ffarOffice, the Admiralty and the Air Force: but that the civilaide should be re-organised without delay into a, single Depart-raent, the head of which shoulri be responsible for the cbllee-tion and dissemination of all intelli*$enee, the Departmentbeing placed under the jurisdiction of a Minister of Cabinetrank, who would bo responsible for bringing speoinl items to thenotice of the Cabinet, or, if necessary, for taking; action onhis own authority; that the Department should be financed, fromthe interest on a large capital1 sum of money to bo planed atits disposal; and that an organ!ention should also beappointed to superintend anti-Bolshevist propaganda throughoutthe country, by means of Press notices, cinematographic films,and the appointment of speakers. In the opinion of the Committee,the official best fitted to be in charge of the above Depart-meht was Mr. Basil Thomson, provided, as previously ,stated, hecould be relieved of his other duties. As regards the :Minister who should supervise this Department, in ordinarycircumstances the Homo Secretary was obviously the man to whomthese duties should be entrusted. It was doubtful, however,whether the.-Secretary of State for Home Affairs would havesufficient leisure personally to. undertake the work. In brief,the proposals of his Committee hod been, (i) that a new Depart-ment for the collection and dissemination pf intelligence 1should be oonntructed, under 1-s.r. Basil Thomson:    (ii) that
there should be a Minister in general charge of the Department: (iii) that the necessary funds should be provided by the allocation of a capital sum, as it was unlikely that Parliament, after the termination of the War, when Votes of Credit would no longer be available, would be disposed to vote for Secret Service the very large sums which in recenty vote for Secret Service the very large sums which in recent years had been expended on that object: (iv) that machinery should be established for the purposes of propaganda, which at present was conducted in a rather sporadic and desultory manner. The Foreign Office which had a Political Intelligence Department were now engaged in re-creating a Publicity Branch to replace the late Ministry of Information, and important propaganda in the United States South America and the new countries that were being called into being would be conducted by this Department, which however, could not under-take home propaganda.   If it was decided to adopt the recommendations of his Committee and to set up new machinery it was essential that this should be in touch with the Foreign Office, which would provide the necessary information. In conclusion, he suggested that another Committee should be appointed to investigate the suggestion of special machinery for propaganda at home and to report to the Cabinet in due course.

The Minister of Labour enquired whether it was intended that the new Department should confine its activities to anti-Bolshevist propaganda: if so, would be of a temporary and not of a permanent nature. Directly that line was crossed, however, there was a probability of the Department embarking upon political propaganda, the nature of which would vary with successive administrations. For instance, the present Cabinet might be replaced by a Labour Government which would use the Department for purposes of Socialist propaganda. As a matter of fact, he was now carrying out


propaganda by the aid of private funds, ah he had not feltjustified in utilising o^ato money for this purpose,    ,She Acting bearstayy of ;:tate for yoreign Affairs statedthat ho thought the btate wa$ both entitled and bound toprotect Itself, and that it would he easy to:Justify toParliament the utse of public money for this purpose.     Hehimwelf was in favour of the allocation of a&quot; capital: sura,in order to finance tho new Pepartasent,     She preuent pro-poisal wae to iseot an iiorainent daagor:   the future might beleft to llofc after itself, ,:.&apos;r. Sonar baw proposed that Lord Gurgon*s Committee, with. to. the nature of the nev: machinery to be set up,She Chancellor of the  bcehocjuer thought that it wouldnot be neee&amp;eaxy for the Admiralty and the &quot;&quot;ar office to berepresented on the &quot;new  omraltteo, as thoy were not apeoially     - 1concerned.   On the question of principle, that is to eay0 1the question of organising a nev; Bopaytjaent,&apos; the treasury jwould raise no objection;   they would wish, however, before,the new Department t&amp;aw efot&amp;bli&amp;hed, to bo given the ^opportunitybeforehand of examining tho details ens- regardfc the pay, &apos;.etd0 ,of the officials.     He, personally, held strongviews inregard to tho proposal toallocate a capital auo, *. - He did.not think thero vcais txny aecebaity - at pre sent for, the .  - 1Cabinet to go into tho question of financing the new Dep&amp;rfc-raent, and unless estimates had already been prepared he did -not think that their oubmisslon sue a matter of urgency,She t^-vy -^aejsQi;mry....tn the admiralty, &quot;said,&apos; withrraferonoo to the point raised hj tho chancellor of thel^ehe^uer. in regard to the constitution of tho nov. comaittee,ho did not think it nocoo^ar^ for the Admiralty to be...... vf-,;&apos;v&quot; -
represented, as the question had been originally brought to the notice of the War Cabinet by Mr. Long in a personal capacity and not as First Lord of the Admiralty.

The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that if his Committee were to be re-assembled in order to conduct the further enquiry proposed by Mr. Bonar Law, he hoped that Mr. Long. The Minister of Labour, the Home Secretary and the President of the Board of Education would be members of it. Each Minister, of course, would be entitled to brihg with him to meetings of the Committee an expert of his Department. He attached great importance, however, to Ministers, and not their representatives, being members of the Committee.  Unless the Heads of Department themselves were present, there were always difficulties in arriving at any decision.

Mr. Bonar Law thought that if Mr. Basil Thomson were placed in charge of the new Department he should submit his reports to the Home Secretary, who, in the present case, might depute Sir Hamar Greenwood to exercise supervisory functions. In his opinion, a capital grant was out of the question. The view had been expressed that Parliament might object, to granting further sums for the purposes of Secret Service, but he himself did not anticipate any great difficulty in regard to this. If trouble arose, it must be risked, and the usual answer would be given in the House of Commons that "Secret Service is Secret". He suggested that the re-formed Committee, as proposed above, should submit to the Treasury reasoned estimates of the amounts it would be necessary to allot in order to establish the new Department. In his opinion, all that the War Cabinet was called upon to-day to decided was whether or not it was desirable to get the Secret Service reconstructed on the best possible basis. There was no necessity to decide the money question that morning. He suggested,




therefore, that the Committee, re-constituted in the form proposed by Lord Curzon, should be re-assembled, in order to consider the question of Home propaganda and to make recommendations to the Cabinet in due Course.

The War Cabinet decided --

(a) To accept in principle the recommendations made in the Report of Lord Curzon&apos;s Committee, subject to the reservations stated below:-

(i) That the suggestion to grant a capital sum for the financing of the new Department was not accepted:

and

(ii) That proposals for providing the necessary funds should be submitted to the Treasury before being placed on the Parliamentary votes.

(b) That the Read of the new Department should report to the Home Secretary, or, if he so desired, to his Parliamentary Secretary:

(c) That the committee, re-constituted as under:-

Lord Cruzon,

Mr Long,

Sir Robert Horne,

Mr Fisher,

Mr Shortt.

Should re-assemble forthwith in order to consider and report on the necessary organisation to ensure that adequate publicity be given to, and suitable steps taken to prevent, the dangers of

Bolshevism in this country.
