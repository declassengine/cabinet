	Sir Herbert Nield,

	Mr. Havelock Wilson,

	Mr. G. Stewart, and

	Major C.F. Entwistle.

(e ) In considering the amendments to be made to the Bill the Ministers concerned were asked not to overlook the strong feeling in the country against the employment of aliens on board British ships, the pledges given by many Members of parliament at the time of their election and, above all, the importance of maintaining the standard of British seamanship, They were asked to bear in mind the danger of lowering this standard, if the percentage of British Officers and men is allowed to fall too low, a danger which is increased by the development of the United States mercantile marine with relatively high pay and good conditions. It was recognised however that no steps must be taken which would tend in any way to close the mercantile marine to Indian and Native Seaman of the British Empire, and that different conditions might apply in British ships trading wholly in distant waters.

 "Dr. ADDISON stated that the Government would be in a difficulty somewhat similar to that encountered in the Aliens Restriction Bill in connection with Lord Robert Cecil&apos;s proposed, new clause to the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Bill, the effect of which would be not only to reduce the qualifying age of women to twenty-one, but also to give women the same Franchise rights as men.  His information was that there strong feeling in the House on this question.

LORD EDMUND TALBOT reported that the Speaker of the House of Commons and Mr. Whitley had both decided that Lord Robert Cecil&apos;s amendment was out of order.
