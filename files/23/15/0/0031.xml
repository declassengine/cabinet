C  RET -WAR CABINET 616 A.BRAPT CONCLUSIONS of a Meeting held at 10, Downing Street,S.W. 1,  on FRIDAY, AUGUST 15,   1919, at 11-30 a.m., MILITARY The War Cabinet had before them the following documentsAll ESTI-h&apos;s, a Note by the Minister of Shipping,onShipbuilding  (Paper G.T.-7899),An Admiralty Memorandum on Shipbuilding(Paper G.T .-7959) .The consideration of these Memoranda gave rise to a dis- cussion on the Naval, Military and Air Estimates.The -&apos;/ar Cabinet reached the following Conclusions :-The Admiralty, and the -7ar Office and AirMinistry,  should work out their Estimates,on the/following bases:-(1) It s ho-aid be assumed,  for framing revisedEstimates, that the British Empire willnot be engaged in any great war duringthe next ten years,  and that no Expedi-tionary Force is required for this pur-pose .(P) No alteration should be made, withoutCabinet authority, in the pre-warstandard governing the size of the Navy.) No new Naval construction should be under-taken, and the Admiralty should make everyeffort to stop constructional work onvessels that have no value for mercantilepurposes .    This decision is taken from thepoint of view both of economy and of ihereas-Ing the output of mercantile construction.(4) The principal function of- the Militaryand Amir Forces is to provide garrisonsfor India, Egypt, the new mandatedterritory and all territory (other thanself-governing;) under British control,as well as to provide the necessarysupport to the civil power at home.
(5)  As regards Ireland,  the present ecndi- &apos;tions may necessitate a garrison inexcess of the normal, but within twelvemonths there is a reasonable probabil-ity that a normal garrison will suffice.(6)  In order to save man-power, the utmostpossible use is to be made of mechanicalcontrivances, which should oe regardedas a means of reducing Estimates.(7)  In framing the Estimates, the followingmaximum figures should be aimed at:-Royal Navy  ...............   60,000,000Army and Royal Air Force  .  75,000,000.The First Lord of the Admiralty and theSecretary of State for far undertook toexamine the problem on the ahowe bases.4,  Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.I.,August  15,  1919.-a-
