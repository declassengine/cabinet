-1    i &apos;       *    119CAMCS. (1) The Prime Ministers arrived before the conclusionof a Meeting on Tanks, and the first part of the meeting was devoted to this subject and is reported separately.SHE WESTERN (2) ^he Chief of the Imperial General Staff informedmom. j ;ithe Committee of Prime Ministers that portions of the&quot;&quot;H!lArmy, including Austr adLian,and: Canadian/, and Trench divi-sions ,j^as^ngV7y&apos;1dlvA^i^ attacked betweenthe Somme and the Avre this morning, and the latest in-formation indicated that an advance had been made to adepth of from 3 to 5 kilometres, and that all was goingwell0    Our objectives were limited, and if they were achieved it would render Amiens free from enemy bombard-ment and allow it to be fully utilised for military re-quirements.    The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stat-ed that field Marshal Eaig was commanding the Imperial andL^Erenoh troops in person.    The attack had been primarily    ;;nmade by Tanks0FUTURE MIIiIT^       (3) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff, in reply &apos;ARY POLICY.to the Prime Minister, said that he had not been able to reply to the questions of the Committee of Prime Min-ministers in regard to possible action in Austria, Bulgaria, jand Turkey, in support of our foreign policy,, for thereason that up to the present he had not been able toobtain the information he required from the Foreign Of-fice.   As instructed by the Committee he had approach-ed   Lord Robert Cecil on the subject, and Lord robert cecil, he understood, had talked it over with Mr. Balfour,but up to the present he had not received their views.At present all that he could do was to explain to theCommittee the difficulties-as regards the time table in-  /volved in any blow against Austria. /-2.

The Chief of the Imperial S&amp;x General Staff saidthat it would take from 6 to 7 weeks to mount an attackon the Italian front against Austria.    In October, how-ever, there was a danger of snow in the High Alps, whichwould put a stop to operations.   Consequently, unlessMarshal Foch was in a position to set free the requirednumber of divisions at once/ no important attack couldbe made before the snow fell.    The Germans could mountan attack in about six weeks from the date of commencing -ing preparations.   At present, there was absolutely no information of their doing so.    If they took their deci-sion today, they might mount an attack by the middle ofSeptember.    Hence, unless they started at once there wasnot much prospect of a heavy attack on the Alpine front.Of course, however, they could attack any time on thePiave, except that after snow had fallen there was a risk of floods.In reply to the Prime Minister he said that he couldnot yet explain the presence of an Austrian division onthe Western front. There was no sign as.yet of/exchangehaving been made of German for Austrian divisions.In reply to. Mr* Hughes he said that if he got definition-ing to the Italian front his advice would be for us tosend divisions to meet them.    Of course, Marshal Pochwould have a big say in the matter.In further reply to Mr* Hughes he said that he re-garded the Italian theatre as a most promising one, but-erC it was too late to do anything this autumn.,The.Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that hehad asked Sir Hobert Borden whether he would be preparedto send a Canadian divisiontwhich was kept in England asa training division, to Italy *e een&amp;sjime 44re taafaafeBganite information that 10 or 15 German divisions were mov-

to continue its training there and to he availaXlcooperate in the event of an opportunity for a &quot;blow to hestruck on that front.   At present General Mewburn waslooking into the matter and General Wilson had recommend-ed him to pay a visit to the Italian front if his en-gagements permitted.Sir Eohert Borden explained the difficulties whichthe Canadian Government had to consider &quot;before adoptingthis suggestion.   At the present .time fffcg Canada wasmaintaining 4 divisions which, together with the machine-gun and other organisations, were the equivalent of sixBritish divisions on the Western front.    If another div-ision was added they might find themselves saddled withlarger forces in the field than they could maintain., lastyear they had been asked to add an additional division,but had not felt justified in doing so, but instead had increased the numbers of infantry, and subsequent tothat they had inojsgased their machine-gun organisation.Possibly before long they might wish to convert theCanadian Corps into an Army, since, when the maohine-gun and railway organisations were taken into considera-tion, the strength of the Canadian Corps was probahlyequivalent to that of some of the Armies.    Their fixedpolicy had been not to adopt commitments larger than theycould maintain at full strength.   Moreover, General Mew-burn was very -reluctant to break up the highly efficienttraining organisation which was established at varioustraining camps in this country.    Only recently they had adopted fresh commitments, particularly in regard to theforces in support of the Czechs.    At the present time re-inforcements for the Canadian forces were coming oververy fast, and he believed something like 15,000 men were now on the High Seas en route to England,    He undertook,

19 9A &amp; hihowever, to give the most oareful consideration to theproposal.Che Prime Minister suggested that his decision would nodoubt depend largely on the view he took of the possibilities-ity of a great coUp against the Austrians.   If a shatter-Ing blow could be defat to Austria, it might bring abouta final decision.Mr. Hughes agreed in this view.    He pointed out thatthe Germans were now asew in a very pleasant position. Theycould not any longer explain a?/ay the great fact of theAmerican Army; a heavy blow at Austria might prove acrushing and final blow to them.(LORD ROBERT CECIL, entered at this point).Lord Robert Cacil said that he had sent the Ghief ofthe Imperial General Staff a Memorandum that morning.   Hehad sent it as his own opinion as he had not yet receiv-ed the views of the Chief of the Imperial General Staffon the subject.   Mr. Balfour intended, in making hismm Mx.  sc statement at the Imperial War Cabinet on war aims, to deal with the whole diplomatic situation, and considered that this would cover all the ground requiredby the Chief of the General Staff.    His own Memorandumonly referred to Austria and Bulgaria, as he had not un-derstood that the Poreign Office views, in regard to Turkeywere also required.    He mentioned that a long memorandum had been prepared in the Political Intelligence Depart-ment on the subject of the Austrian situation.   He him-self had only seen a draft of this, very long Memorandum.The general gist of it was that things were so bad un austria that in their view it would be better not totake any. action which might bring the various sections to*gether.    In explanation of this point of view he saidthat the quarrel in Austria was between the Germans and

the Slavs, both of whom hated the Italians.    The &quot;Slavswould probably prefer that Dalmatia should remain underAustrian rule rather than pass to that of Italy.    Hence,it might be better not to take any action which would bring the two points of view together against the Italians.Personally, he did not concur In this view, and oonsider-ed that the moment was favourable to a severe blow atAustria.    He did not wish to discuss the question fur-ther without the presence of the Secretary of State.The Prime Minister asked that lord Robert Cecil wouldalso consider the case of Turkey and let the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff have his views.    He said Itwould be difficult to postpone the matter until Tuesdaywhen Mr. Balfour was to make his Statement on War Aims,as some of the Prime.Ministers-wished to leave at an ear-ly date, and it would be difficult to let the questionof War Policy stand over until then.(4) In the course of the Meeting the Prime Ministerreceived, through His Private Secretary, a telephone mes-sage from Mr. Arthur Henderson, who said that a meeting had taken place that morning between the Labour Party andthe Executive of the Trades Union Congress.    It had beendecided that a Deputation, consisting of Mr. McGurk, Mr.Ogden, Mr. Bowerman, and Mr. Arthur Henderson should pro-ceed to Switzerland to Interview Mr. Troelstra, with theobject of ascertaining the authenticity of certain docu-ments which had been sent to Mr. Henderson by Mr. Troelstra,They undertook not to get into touch with enemy subjects,and Mr, Henderson asked to see the Prime Minister with aview to obtaining from him a guarantee that no obstaclewould be placed in the way of their visit to Switzerland.(THE PRIME ICCHISTEE withdrew from the Meeting tointerview Mr. Author Henderson).     &apos;.

On the Prime Minister1 s return he informed, the Committeeof Prime Ministers that Mr. Arthur Henderson was muoh con-cerned as to whether or no the German Majority Socialist,Scheidemann, had or had not adopted an attitude more inthe direction of the Labour Party&quot;s War Aims than had hitherto been the case.   M. Troelstra had sent a longdocument on the subject, but the Labour Party had not beenable quite to assure themselves as to the authenticityof some of the statements, and&apos;had felt that they couldascertain this better by sending- a Deputation than bywritten communications.    The Prime Minister had explainedthat this was not an entirely British matter, as the De-putation would have to pass &quot;through Prance, and thatonoe the Government allowed one body of persons to go,It would be difficult to stop another. - General Smuts ex-pressed the view that these questions ought to be leftentirely to the Governments.Lord Robert Cecil agreed In this view, which was gener-ally accepted.The Committee of Prime Ministers agreed that:-A reply should be sent to Mr. Arthur Henderson inthe sense that, the Government felt that they couldnot press the French Government to grant permission for the Deputation to proceed to Switzerland. they felt that, once they established the precedent of allowing people to visit neutral countries to eon-*fer with persons coming from enemy countries - andMo Troelstra must have passed into Switzerlandthrough Germany - it would be difficult to re-fuse in other cases where there might be strong objections.(A. telephone message to this effect was sent by-Mr. J.T.Davies alter the Meeting).(5) The Committee of Prime -Ministers decided thats-The discussion&apos;of War Aims should take place-between the British War Cabinet and the PrimeMinisters of the Dominions, with a representative India only.Gardens, S.W.,. _
