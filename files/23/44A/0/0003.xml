THE WESTERN THEATRE.      RE INFO Rfl EMENT from PALESTINE.&apos;With reference to the decision in Imperial War Cabinet19 A., the question was again raised as to the desirability ofcarrying out the transfer of the LlTth Division from palestine to the Western Front.    It was pointed out that certain new factorshad arisen.   First, the Austrian attack on the Italian Front, theissue of which on June SI had still been uncertain, had now been definitely repulsed.   All accounts agreed that the Italian moralhad been greatly improved by this success.   This rendered it possible, in case of necessity, to withdraw a Division, or per-haps more, from the Italian Front.   It was pointed out, haftiggej^that a Division could be transported from the Italian Front inten days at any time, whereas in the case of Palestine it couldonly be rapidly withdrawn when the shipping was available.   Con-seqiiejitly, it was suggested that the three British Divisions in^MsAv&amp;a&amp;M&amp;e provided, under the changed conditions on the italian front, an immediate reserve which could be drawn upon for theWestern Front.   It was suggested, therefore, that it was nowunnecessary to take the risk which all had beam agreed was in-volved in a further withdrawal of white troops from Palestine.Mr LLOYD GEORGE said that within the last few days hehad received rather disquieting reports from Palestine.   He had learned that M. Pieot, the French Political Agent in Palestine,whose interests were French and not British, had expressed somemisgivings as to the British situation in Palestine.   He had saidthat he doubted whether the Indian Mohammedan troops were whollyto be trusted to fight against the Turka, and had instanced thecase where an Indian soldier, on being welcomed as an Ally in the streets of Jerusalem by an Arab soldier, had replied by attackinghim with great fury.   Moreover, Mr LLOYD GEORGE had heard reports,emanating not only from M. Picot but from other sources also,that the view had been expressed by members of General Allenby&apos;s-2-

Staff that by Christmas they would be at Gaza.   He pointed outhow fatal to our prestige in the Bast would be the loss of Jeru-salem.Mr MASSEY, in reply to Mr Lloyd George, said that theloss of Jerusalem would have a considerable effect in New Zealand,but that this effect would not be comparable with the loss of paris, Amiens, or the Channel Ports.GENERAL HARINGTON, who was specially summoned from theWar Office, agreed that the changes on the Italian Front had altered the situation.   He pointed out that the British had two divisions in line and one in reserve on the Italian Front.   TheVllth Division, which was now in reserve, was a very fine fight-ing Division, probably better than the LIVth.   He considered thatit would take two months for the Austrians to mount anotherattack on the Italian Front.   He was inclined to agree, there-fore, that it would be 1b gitimate to rely on the British divisions in Italy to provide a reserve Division, in case of necessity, forthe Western Front.   The only reservation he made was that possiblyGeneral Wilson might have arranged with General Diaz for the em-ployment of the British troops for some counter-offensive againstthe Austrians, although he had no knowledge of any such arrange-ment.   In reply to Mr Hughes, he said that it would take theGermans about a week to transport Divisions from the Western tothe Italian Front,   A British Division could be transported from italy to the Western Front in about ten days. -The Prime Ministers, while unwilling to take a finaldecision on the matter in the absence of the Chief of the Impe-rial General Staff, made the following provisional decisions:-(i) That the Deputy Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff should arrange to suspend the orders forthe departure of the LIVth Division from palestine to the Western Front;(ii) That the question as to whether a British Divi-sion should be brought from the Italian Frontor left there as a reserve to be brought to theWestern Front in ease of emergency, should beconsidered on the return of the Chief of theImperial General Staff,

The Prime Ministers asked the Deputy Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff to arrange that General Wilson should return from italy direct to England, instead of awaiting the arrival of MrLloyd Geprge at Versailles for the Meeting of the Supreme WarCouncil.THE AMERICAN DIVISIONS.In reply to Mr Hughes, GENERAL HARINGTON gave the follow-ing particulars of the American Divisions now in France:-In line, complete with artillery,7 Divisions, with a total of27,000 men in each Division ............ 189,000 men.The Infantry and machine-guns of  Divisions, in line near Meaux ........   40,000The Infantry and machine-guns of3 Divisions on their way to Alsace-Lorraine..............................&apos;.    60,000The Infantry and machine-guns of *3 Divisions now with the british expeditionary Force and ready tobe thrown into the line in theevent of an attack ........0............   60,000Under training with the british forces, and ready in about a fortnight..............................   40.000Total ........... 389,000    ..(GENERAL HARINGTON then withdrew.)THE MOVEMENTS OF THE CHIEF OF THEIMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF.

ALLIED INTERVENTION IN HJSSIAWith reference to Imperial War Cabinet 19 B., the PrimeMinisters had before them the Note of the Japanese Ambassador toMr Balfour, dated June 24, 1918, with a covering-note by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Paper G.T.-4952);   the note of an Interview between Mr Lloyd George and Mo Kerensky(Paper G.T.-4948), and the Note of a Conversation between MrPhilip Kerr and M. Kerensky (Paper G.T.-4948 A).Mr LLOYD GEORGE, after reading the Note of the japanese ambassador, pointed out the meaning of it was that Japan was pre-pared to intervene in Siberia if the United States of Americaagreed, that the Command must be Japanese, but that Japan wouldnot commit herself to go beyond Central Siberia.   He pointed outthat What mattered to us was not who was in occupation of EasternSiberia, but who was at Omsk.   He had gathered, in his own con-versation with the Japanese Minister, that the Japanese consideredthemselves as bound by an obligation of honour to carry out theirtreaty with the British Government, but, as this treaty onlyapplied to the. Far East, they did not feel bound to press to theWest, as the Allies desired.LORD MILNER said that, in his view, it had always been rather a tall order to ask the Japanese to pledge themselves to goto any particular point.SIR ROBEHD BOHDEN said that our real object was toendeavour to induce the anti-German elements in Russia to unitein opposing Germany.   It was quite clear that they could not makeany headway without Allied intervention.   He started from thepremise that intervention, nominally, at any rate, must be Allied,and that Japan was not to benefit territorially, and he gathered that Japan, in If Note, had consented to both these conditions.Subject to this, if Japan would go as far as Irkutsk, he thought we should encourage her to do so.   Perhaps, after she had once

embarked on the expedition, she could be induced to go further.In his view, it would be a mistake to reject an offer to interveneat all.Mr HUGHES and Mr MASSEY pointed out that, from an australian -lasian point of view, there were considerable advantages in en-ecouraging Japan to devote her energies to intervention in Siberia.Mr HUGHES said, however, that it was necessary to consider carefully the effect on Russian opinion.   If Japanese intervention wouldenable the Czecho-Slovaks to succeed and render it possible forM. Kerensky to rally Russia, then it would be an admirable thing.As long as it enabled us to win the War, the future situation inthat region could be cleared up subsequently;   but if, on the otherhand, the effect of Japanese intervention was to cause Russianopinion t o coalesce against Japan and to say they would ratherhave the Germans than the Japanese, then the effect would be dis-astrous.SIR ROBERT BO EDEN pointed out that this was a point onwhich we could only exercise our judgment, and on which the exactresults could not be foreseen.Mr -MASSEY raised the question as to whether the supreme command oould be- conceded to the Japanese.Mr LLOYD GEORGE pointed out, in this respect, that Britishtroops had already served under the Japanese in the expeditionagainst Kaiu-Ghau.   In the present instance the Allied contingentswould not be much larger than the British contribution had been atKaiu-Chau. : So far as British troops were concerned, he thought there would be no objection to Japanese Command.   He asked sir robert Borden whether, in the event of Canadian Railway Engineersbeing sent, they would have any objection to serving under JapaneseC ommand.SIR ROBERT BORDEN thought there would be no objection.LORD MILNER pointed out that, unless Japan was to betreated as an equal, it would be.better not to ask her to interveneat all.    She would be supplying almost the whole of the force to

intervene in Siberia, and it wonId be impossible to refuseSupreme Command to the nation that was supplying the bulk ofthe force.The Prime Ministers then discussed a Draft resolution by the Imperial War Cabinet, which had been prepared by theSecretary as a basis for discussion.   After some discussion, thePrime Ministers approved tha^^th^i;ttra1gEed draft should be sub-mitt ed on the following day to the Imperial War Cabinet.Whitehall Gardens, S .W.1.,June S7, 1918.
