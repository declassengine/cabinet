P. 71.k HUGHES M-) *n ^Iie early part of the discussion it transpired that Mr. Hughes did not recollect having received Paperentitled &quot;The Estimates of Allied and Enemy Strengths&quot;prepared by the General Staff.   (W.B.-71). The committee felt this was a serious matter, as the document was oneof great secrecy, and instructed the Seoretary -to gotosnoAiiojsrIWEEH THETED KING-81 AMD THEIINIONS. &apos;E DRAFTCRT.into the matter with Mr. Hughes.(S) With reference to Imperial War Cabinet 3 A. Min-ute 3, LORD MILKER drew attention&apos;to the publication in&quot;The Times&quot; of the details of the arrangements in regardto communication between the Prime Ministers of the Dom-inions and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and continuing the Sessions of the Imperial War Cabinet.THE PRIME MINISTER said that this was a serious matter which would have to be considered at the War Cabinet la-ter in the morning.As Sir Robert Borden would be unable to attend fur-ther Meetings, it was agreed that,  in the first instance,the Prime Ministers should hear his views in regard tothe Report,in order that they might discuss them withhim and embody them.SIR ROBERT BORDEN said that, on the previous after-noon, he had gone right through the Report with Sir Maur-ice Harifcay.    He had made a number of suggestions, mainlyverbal^ and in regard to matters of- detail.    The mostimportant of these was in Paragraph SI.    He did. not likethe use of the term &quot;A Balance Sheet of profit and loss in regard to man-power.&quot;   In dealing with matters of life and death he felt that this expression was too .callous to appear in a formal official document.Sir Robert Borden1 s suggestion wasagreed to by the Committee.v - v     2. ::   E

SIS ROBERT BOSSES&quot;, continuing, said he had one re-mark of substance to make in regard to the body ofthe Report.    He referred to Paragraph 37, where thedraft proposed that the Committee should adopt the viewthat, provided that casualties were not excessive, theallied countries could be sustained by the hope of almost certain victory to be achieved by the 8,ccumulation ofoverwhelming forces in 1920.    He would be very sorry to commit himself to the postponement of the attack until1920.    Prom other portions of the Report he could not seethe possibility of the Allies being stronger relative tothe enemy in 1920 than in 1919.    The facts, in Paragraphs24 and 25 indicated that the Allies would be stronger InJuly 1919 than in December 1919, as compared with theenemy.   Personally, he could not make a confident state-ment as to ho?/ this would impress his own people.    Hewas apprehensive as to the affect on public opinion inCanada of such a policy, though he admitted it was diffi-cult to prophesy.(This subject was taken up again in thediscussion on Part Y)ZSIR ROBERT B0RDE1T, turning to the Conclusions, saidthat he agreed absolutely in the principle of Conclusion&apos;(1), though there might be room for an alteration in thephraseology.    He would prefer to put Conclusion (2) ra-ther differently, stating that the higher posts shouldbe filled &quot;by the best men available, irrespective of whether they s,re soldiers or civilians,,&quot;THE PRIME MINISTER said his view was that the fact ofa man being a civilian should be neither a recommendation3.

tvor deterrent.    At ^BR* present it was a deterrent.SIR ROBERT BORDEH said the same principle should applyto xDrofessional soldiers.LORD MILKER referred to the suggestion in Conclusion(2) that the practice of employing civilians in the High-er Commands had produced admirable results in the Domin-ion forces&apos;, he suggested that the Dominions had had no option in the matter.SIR ROBERT BORDEH pointed out that Canada had had a force of 6,000 permanent troops, so it did apply, to someextent, to them.MR HUGfHBS:said the Australian Officers were now allAustralians and nearly all civilians.&apos;   MR MASSEY, while paying a tribute to the great mil-itary qualities shown by the civilians in the Hew Zealandforces, said that, nevertheless, if you took two men, oneof whom was a professional soldier, and the other a- civil-ian, other things being equal, it seemed to stand to rea-son that the professional must be the better.SIR ROBERT BQRDEH, in regard to this, pointed out thedanger that a professional Army tended to get into a rut.He had had reports to this effect frOm a very disting-uished Canadian Officer, who had said that the Canadianpermanent forces had tended to get into a groove and be-come purely mechanical, with the result that enterprisingOfficers found themselves obstructed and tended themselv-es to become mechanical.LORD MILKER uttered a caveat that he had objections to conclusion (1)sir ROBERT BORDEK said he stood strongly for the prin-ciple of Conclusion (1). When he first came over to thiscountry he was struck by the fg t that some of the higherunits were commanded by indifferent Officers.4o &apos;

THE PRIME MINISTER expressed the view that Conclusion(l) should not come first among the Conclusions.LORD MILNER said that as it stood Conclusion (1) was too severe a criticism of the British Government.    Itconveyed the impression that it had taken the seriousevents of March 1918 to &quot;bring about changes in the Com-mands.THE PRIME MINISTER said he would accept that particu-lar criticism of the Government,&apos;  We had, in fact, made some changes before 21st March.    He informed his col-leagues that some time before,the ex-Chief of the Imper-ial General Staff (&quot;General Sir William Robertson),had advised that General Gough was not a suitable person toretain in the Command,    The Prime Minister had authorised him to take the necessary action,   -It had, at the sametime, been considered desirable to change the Chief ofthe General Staff and the Director of Military Intelli-gence. General Robertson, finding that Sir Douglas Haigwished to keep all these Officers, had compromised by re-moving the two latter, and had left General Gough,    $henthe present Chief of the Imperial General Staff (general sir Henry Wilson), who was a personal friend of GeneralGough, had advised that it would, be better not to retainhim in his Command, and the Prime Minister had authorised him to send a very strong letter to Pield Marshal Haig onthe subject.    The Pield Marshal, however, had strongly resisted the change, and the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff had advised the Government not to press the matter at the moment,MR HUGHES, said he quite understood the position. Noone could be here for long without realising that thereY/ere very strong forces to keep Officers in their posi-tions.    In fact, this was usually the case when-any

change was considered desirable.    It was more serious,however, in regard to the Army, because human Aife was at stake.    If it was desired to get rid of a permanent of-ficial in a Government Department, and the Head of theOffice refused to take action, the Government would ex-ercise its power.    What he asked was whether the forces which had operated previously might not be too strongfor the Government on future occasions.   What would bethe position if someone in authority refused to carryout their wishes?    If Field Marshal Haig had been too strong for the Government last year, surely, after recentvictories, he was stronger today.LOAD MILKER said that the British Government had nev-er been stronger in regard to these matters than theywere today0    Ho one had dealt so ruthlessly with them  ,as the present Prime Minister.    The difficulty did notarise in the acceptance of the principle.MR HUGHES asked, what would be the position in regardto an Officer like General Gough today if the government wished to get rid of him?THE PRIME MINISTER said that after the disaster theGovernment had insisted that General Gough must&apos;be re-moved from Ais Command.   Field Marshal Haig had refused.He himself had then given him an order on behalf of theGovernment, and he had a.t once obeyed it; in point of fact, there were Officers who, in his opinion, ought tobe removed, and he mentioned some of them by name.MR HUGHES said that, after the disaster of March 21,Field Marshal Haig had been in a weak position, since hewas hardly in a position to refuse.    Today, however, af-ter his great success, he would be in a position to say&quot;Now, and he stood at the head of a great military &quot;hier-archy.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that he would not hesitate for,a moment to insist on the views of the Government beingcarried out; neither would the Secretary &apos;of State forWar.    Nevertheless, he felt absolutely confident thatField Marshal Haig would not take that view.LORD MILNER concurred in this, but said, nevertheless,it was very unfortunate if the Government had to inter-fere in subordinate Commands.    It was a very grave thing to interfere in these matters.SIR ROBERT BORDEN said this led up to another consider-,   eration, namely, whether a Commander was not too much in-fluenced by his loyalty to his own friends; he agreed with Lord Milner that it was undesirable for the Govern-ment to interfere continuously.    He himself had the great-est respect for Field Marshal Haig, and had always hadthe most excellent personal relations with him, but, neves-thelass, if he had been in England last winter after thet      Passchendaele offensive, he would have pressed for hisremoval, although he did not think that this step shouldbe taken at the present time.MR HUGHES said that nothing he had said must be takento reflect in the least upon the Commander-in-Chief, buthe thought one of Field Marshal Haigrs defects was an ex-cess of loyalty to his friends.THE- PRIME MINISTER agreed and said his weak point real-ly was in his choice of men.    He liked to choose oldcomrades and men he thought he could get on with well,rather than according to menTs professional qualities.He gave instances.lusions SIR ROBERT BORDEN said he agreed in Conclusions (3)and (4).and (4).

icluslonhinclusionSIR ROBERT BORDEN proposed the following amendment ofthe first line of Conclusion (5):-&quot;This principle is not intended to interfere with the-conduct of military operations when once decided on&quot;&quot;&quot;or to hamper.&quot; &quot;(The words underlined were new).THIS AMENDMENT WAS ACCEPTED.sir ROBERT BORDEN agreed in Conclusion (6).THE PRIME MINISTER proposed to amend one sentence inthis Conclusion as follows&quot;The British Government should not unduly reduce the-output of these machines,11and to say&quot;The British Government should materially increase-the output of these machines0&quot;THIS AMENDMENT WAS AGREED TO.He also proposed to add at the end some such sentenceas the following:-&quot;The Committee are not satisfied with the present out--put of Tanks.&apos; and they gladly take note of the inten-tion of the Minister of Munitions to increase theodtput, asd &apos;Iphey trust that&apos; every possible effort willbe made to realise his estimate.&quot;conclusion (7).     SIR ROBERT BORDEN agreed in Conclusion 70onclusion (8).      SIR ROBERT BORDEN said that Canada could maintain theCanadian Porces at their-present strength for a year atleast.    Casualties had been estimated on the outside scale-of ISO,000 casualties in IS months, 40,000.of which was foxkilled, with an estimate that 70 per cent, of the remain-ing 80,000 would return to the Colours.Conclusion(9).Conclusion(10).SIR ROBERT BQRDEN agreed in Conclusion (S)ASIR ROBERT BORDEN agreed in Conclusion (10)o

delusion SIR ROBERT BORDEN said that the Government might1)have to decide whether it would not he necessary to makea supreme effort In 1919 at the risk of shattering the ArmyoTHE PRIME MINISTER agreed that if Marshal Poch saidthat,by maintaining the Army at full strength we couldensure victory,the matter might have to he reconsidered.SIR ROBERT BORDEU asked whether in every war a timedid not come when it became necessary to throw in allreserves to seek a decision?THE PRIME MINISTER said that if you found in thecourse of a battle that such an opportunity occurred,there would be no hesitation.,LORD MIIHER said that Oonolus ions (loj and (ll] neededconsiderable reconsideration.THE PRIME MINISTER said it depended, to some extent,on what Marshal Poch would say a    He reminded his col-leagues, however, that we had a great Eastern Empire todefend.    He.did not wish to have to withdraw every manfrom Prance to save our Eastern Empire, and possibly haveto call in the Americans as well.GENERAL SMUTS suggested that(10)and(11)ought to beconsidered with(19)and(SO), since they all dealt withthe situation after 1913,MR HUGHES said it was obvious that the position wouldbe very delicate as regards our Allies.    It would bedifficult to tell Prance and our other Allies that we now preferred to look after ourselves and to draw theline as to the number of troops we would place at stakes,Lord MI3MBR said the question would never be putthat way to our Allies.    We would entirely justify

ourselves by saying that the men withdrawn from theArmy were required for Allied services that were evenmore important to our Allies for winning the War thanthe maintenance of our foroes.TEE PRIME MINISTER said we should simply say to themthat if they could do with less steel, ooal, and tex-tiles, we could increase the size of our Army.    In pro-portion to Canada our  nay represented a force of1,200,000 Canadians; and in proportion to Australia, a force of 800,000 Australians.SIR ROBPgT BORDEN said the comparison was not a fairone, as Canada had a considerable population of unnatur-allsed neutrals who could not be compulsorily recruited.MR HUGHES said his own wish was to carry out Conolu-sion (11), although, as he had often stated to the Com-mittee, if we won the War and bled to death in the pro-cess, it would be equivalent to a defeato   We must, how^ever, be very careful with the Allies.MR LLOYD asked whether we were using Coloured troopsin the Army- in Prance?GENERAL RADCLIPEE said the policy was&apos;to use coloured troops abroad to relieve British troops who were thenavailable for the Western front.THE PRIME MINISTER said that if the Government wereadvised by the General Staff to have mixed divisionsthey would be prepared to consider it.    If we could re-duce the number of men in the divisions, or if we couldincorporate Coloured troops, we could maintain the num-ber of divisions.MR LLOYD said he had raised this question from thepoint of view, of the great desirability of having our army at full strength when peace was discussed.

MR HUGHES said that from/bhe point of Australia, itwas very important for us to maintain the number of di-thevisions in the field.    If/Australian people heard thatGreat Britain had decided to fight in the workshopand the factory, they would say that.their men could also do greater service to the War by Increased work athome of. some kind or another.SIR ROBERT BORDEH said this argument had already been used in Canada, particularly during the Compulsory Ser-vice Election.    It had teen said that Canada could and the  Empire better &quot;by raising food than in any other way.How they said: &quot;let the United States of America put in ,000,000 men, and when they have done this, we will consider sending more men.&quot;MR HUGHES said the position was easier in Cs,nada,where Conscription was in force, but in Australia, un-der Voluntary Service, it was much more difficult, andthe argument applied more strongly.THE PRIME MINISTER said, that our man-power was nowalmost completely exhausted.    It was not a question of withdrawing men from Prance to put in the workshops, buti^by not replacing men/graduallytJ^e reduce the forces./k -    a ......- ---^a , ^__&quot;In reply to Mr. Hughes he said that Conclusion (11)meant a reduction by wa-stage and not by&apos; taking the menhome. &apos;;LORD MIINER suggested that&apos; it would be better not tostate the specific number of 36 divisions in Conclusion(11).THE PRIME MINISTER said that this was an instruction to whoever went to represent the British case at theSupreme War Council, and it would be necessary for himto give a figure as the sise to which our forces was tobe reduced,llo

MR MAS8EY agreed with Lord Milner, and wanted to stop/the word &quot;1919&quot; in the fourth line.LORD MILKER said that Marshal foch  would probablysay that he preferred to keep 59 divisions of smallersize.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that Marshal Eooh wasnot trustee of the British Empire, and the Governmentwas.    The difficulty was that Marshal foch  would say:&quot;We must not reduce jftm divisions,&quot;,and Eleld MarshalHaig would say: &quot;We must not reduce battalions.&quot;GENERAL.RAD OBIEEE said that Marshal foch ^s point o view would be that he wanted the maximum number of di-visions early in 1919, even if they had to be reducedlater, because he knew that more Americans would beavailable as the year progressed.THE PRIME MINISTER said that, of course, we. would con-tinue to fight resolutely, but there would be no chanceof achieving our War Aims and retaining the islands ofthe South Pacific and South-West Africa if we had noArmy at the end.MR HTJGHES asked If we ought not to invite the Erenchto tell us what they intended to do in the matter?THE PRIME MINISTER&apos;said they would promise to main-tain their divisions, the trouble was they did not carryout their undertakings.MR HUGHES suggested the proper attitude to take wasto promise to do our utmost, as heretofore, but to sayfrankly that, in the present state of our man-power,we could not hope to do as much as before, pointing outthat this applied eciually to Erance and Italy, though allwould do their best.

THE PRIME MINISTER said the situation would be much easier If Pield Marshal Haig took the same view as Mar-shal Poch in regard to the reduction of the size of divisions rather than the divisions themselves.GENERAL SMJTS pointed out that the Germans had reduc-ed their battalions to a rifle strength of 750 men,GENERAL. RADCLIPPE said that 150 machine-gunners must be added to this.THE PRIME MINISTER drew attention to Paragraph 25 ofthe Report.    He gathered that the Prench intended to keep up 103 divisions, although their rifle strength would on-400,000ly be abQut &amp;x&amp;&amp;&amp;/men.GENERAL RADCLIPPE said the Prench were going to main-tain their divisions by putting in Blacks or anyone theycould get.    We had not so many Black fighting races todraw on.THE PRIME MINISTER asked if Indians oould not be in-eluded?LORD MILNER said it was contrary to our general policy,which was. to keep the Indians for the defence of our East-ern interests.    The question of whether&quot; this policy wasa proper one was perhaps arguable.    To send British troops to the East and bring Indian troops to Europe would real-ly only be an exchange of personnel.GENERAL SMUTS apprehended that next year we shouldhave a very big Army in-the West, which might not beable to obtain a decision, and should be threatened inthe East.LORD MILNER said that he-had lately received informa-tion of certain Prench divisions which were composed al-most entirely&apos; of Poles, Czecho-Slovaks^ and Black troops.

THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that General Monro might&quot;be asked to send Indians to France, with a view/o ourmaintaining a larger number of divisions.GENERAL EADCLIFFE said that the General Staff werehadready to consider this.    The Indien troops te/not reallyteen a great success in France.    So long as their own ,British Officers, who knew their language, commandedthem, all had gone well, but after this they had rathergone to pieces.MR HUGHES asked whether Indian troops oould be herebefore next July?THE PRIMS MINISTER said they could be here long before that.SIR ROBERT BORDEN said that before the Committee leftfexsgxsirk Conclusion (11) he would like to state that fromthe Canadian point of view it would be better to re-tain a larger number of divisions,even if you had to re-duce them in sise, than to reduce divisions.MR HUGHES said that from the point of view of Austral-ia, it would be fatal to reduce the number of divisions.He believed the result would be that there would be 20,000 Dominion fighting troops as compared with about400,000 British, and this would have a serious effect inAustralia.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that, in addition.,there would be 3 British divisions in Italy and the british divisions now in Salonica.GENERAL SMUTS said that this was a very strong argument for reducing the strength of divisions rather than abolish-ing divisions.14 o

fgi    15.5LORD MILKER referred to the Prime ministers propo-, sal to substitute Sank divisions for some of the infan-try divisionsoTHE PRIME MINISTER said from&quot;information he had receiv-ed from Mr. churchill in France, it appeared that 100,000men would be required for manning Tanks, as comparedwith the previous estimate of 40,000.    His plan was tomake them into Tank divisions to replace some of the in-fantry divisions.SIR ROBERT BORDBN agreed in Conclusion (IE, which he pointed but gave effect to the Prime Minister?s plan.SIR ROBERT BORDEN then read Conclusion (13), to which- he did not dissent.MR MASSEY said the position seemed to depend a good. deal on what happened In Ireland.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he thought the Govern-meat would probably apply Conscription in Ireland, buthe considered that the General Staff ought not to baseany considerable increase of force on this consideration.SIR ROBERT.BORDEN pointed out that the position in Ire-land was somewhat similar to what it had been in Quebec.In the discussions precedent to the application of Com-pulsory Service to Quebec, he had pointed out that Sana-da might get some men from this Province, but that therewould be riots and possibly eventually a force of from50,000 to 60,000 men might have to be kept there to keeporder.    The problem in Ireland was similar, but moreacute.MR HUGHES deprecated entering on this subject.MR MASSEY said that, nevertheless, he&apos; considered ita scandal that Ireland, as part of the Empire, was not doing its duty.

&apos;    155MR HUGHES asked the meaning of Conclusion (14)?SIR ROBERT BORDEN said he had not clearly understoodit, hut Sir Maurice Hankey had given him an explanationwhich, in fact, was given in Paragraph S6, and which herecapitulated.GENERAL RADGLIFPE said that, after visiting Prance,he had formed the opinion that it would be a mistake to try and put the American troops into British divisions,,It would be wrong to give the Americans the impression that we were trying to m them to our apron strings.    the americans he.d a strong feeling that they wanted to get on their own basis; they had not found the Prench Staffwork very satisfactorily.    There had been frequentchanges in orders, with the result that they were veryhaveanxious to to/their own Officers.    This had been aocent-uated by the good military performances of their troops.In his view the most satisfactory way of helping them wasto get the Americans alongside our troops on the flank of our Army, when we could assist them a good deal inregard to transport^, which was their weak point,    TheFrench appeared to take every opportunity of keeping the americans separate from the BritishoTHE PRIME MINISTER pointed out the language diffi-oulty; no doubt the Americans would have done betterwith us*MR MASSEY suggested that it was, nevertheless,- a very good thing that the experiment of placing them with the prench was tried.MR HUGHES suggested the possibility of making anArmy of Americans and Australians, who might get on welltogether,.SIR ROBERT BORDEN agreed in Conclusion (15)16 s

THE PRIMS MINISTER proposed to omit this Conclusion.(THIS WAS AGREED TO).LORD MILKER said he was not at all convinced as tothe suggestion In Conclusion (17) that an allied offen-sive this autumn in North Italy &apos;was not feasible,,SIR ROBERT BORBEN Agreed in this view.LORD MI LITER said he thought the objections of theGeneral Staff had &quot;been exaggerated.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed in this view.Conclusion(l^) was reserved for furtherconsideration.SIR ROBERT BORDEN expressed agreement in Conclusion(18).MR MASSEY agreed also, but pointed out that it was contrary to the views expressed by some of his colleage-ueSo    He himself was a believer in the Western front,but he gathered, that this was not the view of all theMembers of the Committee.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he agreed in Paragraph(18) because he held, the view that the Western front in-oluded Italy.SIR ROBERT BORDEN agreed in Conclusion (19), but pro-posed to substitute in the second line the word -&quot;deter-mine&quot; for the words &quot;endeavour to say.uSIR ROBERT BORDEN said he could not commit himself to conclusion (ZQ) for reasons he had already given in dis-oussing Paragraph 37 of the Draft Report.LORD MILNER said he thought this conclusion was putin rather a misleading way.THE PRIME MINISTER proposed to omit Conclusion (SO).THIS WAS AGREED TO.

, THE PRIME MINISTER suggested, that conclusion (21)should be made part of (19).(THIS WAS AGREED TO).SIR ROBERT BORDEN agreed in Conclusion (22).THE PRIME MINISTER said he would like to strengthen the last sentence by stating that the Poreign office should take definite steps to detach Turkey by all themeans likely to influence that country.LORD MIIiNER said he would make some suggestions toSir Maurice Hankey on this subject.GENERAL RADCLIPFE said that he had discussed this ques-tion with General Olive.    He&apos;was satisfied there wouldbe certain objections to this proposal on the part ofGo HoIn reply to Lord Milner he said that Italy was abetter training ground than Prance.    G.H.Q. , however,would be hard put to it to find troops for holding theline if they were further reduced.LORD MILNER pointed out that this depended on whetherthe line could be shortened, which, in his opinion, oughtto be possible now that so many American troops were be-ing brought In.THE PRIME MINISTER expressed his intention of press-ing this on the Supreme War Council.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that the Prench wishedto have an -offensive in the Balkans, although they hadno very great forces thexre.     \LORD MILNER said there was a good deal to be said forthis view, as the Allies had made considerable effortsfor arming the Serbians and Greeks, who, at present, were doing nothing.(No dissent was expressed to Conclusion (24).18o

-    153ME HUG-EES raised the question of the reliability ofthe Indian troops.    He reminded his colleagues that doubt-had been thrown on this at the earlier discussions on theremoval of a division from Palestine.TEE PRIME MINISTER said that he had asked the Secretaryof State for War to consider the desirability of employ-ing a larger proportion of British troops in the East and indian troops in the West to safeguard us against this.Ee was not very satisfied at the extent to which we re-lied on Indian troops in the Eastern theatres,MR HUGHES reverted once more to a proposal, he had made during the discussions of the Committee to raise mountedtroops in Australia for service in the East.    This, would,he agreed, involve same reduction of the men availablefor France, but would tap sources of recruits which otherwise would be lost to the War.MR MASSEY agreed ia this view.LORD MI1NER undertook to consider this proposal.THE PRIME MINISTER said he would like to reserve Con-elusion (2-5) for further consideration, as he was inclined to think it might be possible to press the Turks, in thePalestine theatre.    There would be considerable advant-ages in acquiring the whole of Palestine prior to anypeace negotiations-^ in which the Turks might take a part.It would be easier for the Turks to give up somethingthey had lost than to withdraw troops from territorythey occupied.opinion onThe Committee agreed to reserve/Conelusionx (25)*Conclusions (26),  (27), and (28), were agreed to.

SIR MAXffilOE HAJSKEY asked that the last four words &quot;bypropaganda and otherwise&quot; might be omitted, as he under-stood that the Economic Defence and Development Committeeincline to the view that propaganda was undesirable atthe present moment In regard to the economic measures that were gradually being developed.The SecretaryTa proposal was agreed to./Paragraph 50 was agreed to.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the coal situation wasvery serious, and he felt he must draw the Oommitteersattention to it.    Sir Joseph Maclay had represented tohim that it&apos; was vital to bring back men from the Colours.Sir Edward Carson had just written to him expressing theopinion that the coal shortage would have a very serious effect on the stability of the people next winter.   sir edward pointed out that, if the people became short ofcoal, they would object to coal being exported to france and  Italy.MR MASSEY sand that he was visiting Newcastle on Mon-day, was there anything the Prime Minister would like himto say?THE PRIME MINISTER-thanked Mr. Massey, and said itwould be very useful if he could press them to work con-tinuously.   At present the coalminers were receivingbig wages; large numbers of them were unaccustomed to save, and there was not very much for them to spend their money on; consequently, they were inclined to relax their work.    If they could add 10 per cent, to their output,our difficulties would be largely removed.   Eight hours a day steady work throughout the week would make all thealldifference.   At present ships were being held up is theworld over for lack of coal, even in Cardiff and Newport.so.

where he had been last week.    He advised Mr. Massey toget hold of a coal expert to talk to him on the sub-jeot.IiOHD MILNER said that if we withdraw men from Franceit would be an admission that we -had been beaten byabsenteeism.THE PRIME MINISTER aaid the argument on the other sidewas that all the best men had gone to-the War, and onlyGlass B, men were left.    They dropped off work becausethey could not stand the strain.    This was partly true,but other men took advantage of it.The Committee then adjourned.

REPORT Off *LeH3 CQMvflTTHE OS1 PRIi.CS MINISTERS.PRELIMINARY PRAM? AS A BASIS FOR CONSIDERATION.The Inquiry by the Prime Ministers originated fromdiscussions which took place at the Imperial War Cabinet on June13, June 14, and June 20.     It will be convenient to recall someof the leading features of those discussions.    Sir Robert Bordenintroduced the subject of our military policy and organisationby a Tory fi-ank statement madenot with any wish to dwell onevents that had happened, upon which ho considered It useless to lay undue emphasis, but with the desire that we might, in thefuturer avoid the terrible disasters and the unfortunate mistakesof the past.    He pointed out that it was apparent:,, having regardto the good material of which the British Army is composed,, thatthe unfortunate results during the past year had been due to lack of foresightr lack of preparation,, and to defects.of system and organisation..   On the authority of Canadian Officers whohave earned the highest distinction in the present wary he gaveIllustrations of these defects, including lack of proper infornwationr inadequate barbed wire defences^ the retention of indlff-different Commanders in higher appointments, and the failure to usemen of ability whe ;h&amp;ve. entered the Army during the War..    Inparticular he dwelt., as did nearly all his oolleagues front theDominionsr on the disastrous after-effoots of the Passohendaeleoffensive in the ssatumn of 1917.   Sir Robert Borden added that-some of the criticisms- were so severe that he would prefer tocommunicate them privately to Mrv. Lloyd GeorgeMr. Massey gen-&apos;;erally supported Sir Robert BordenTs statement from informationhe had received from, the New Zealand forces, and pointed out that&quot; there is something wrong somewhere and we have got to. find it..&quot;He urged that

some full explanation should be r-tiven ef what took place at Passchendaele and other places,  and as to what had happened to the yth Array, which was still,  to some extent,wrapped In mystery.    General Smuts,  who had regularlyattended the British War Cabinet since the last Session ofthe Imperial War Cabinet,  gave a very full summary of themilitary policy that had been pursued, and of the reasons which had led up tc it.   Like his colleagues he dwelt at -some length on the Passchendaele offensive, and he traceda direct connection between that operation and the disastere.f March 2%.&quot;That was the condition,&quot; he said &quot;at the end of 1917.&apos;..  at which time the Army was really in a deplorable con-dition.   Our men had been worn out by e, summer andautumn of the most ceaseless, bloody, and muddy flirtingIn this whole far, and reached the end of that yeartired, decimated in numbers, with their moral seriouslyimpaired and the situation for us very very serious indeed.Jhe new drafts which had been hurried forward from timeto. time were impt-rfectiy trained,&apos; and that made theposition still more serious, for the future.&quot;&apos;.....;* pur, men, although-jji in a tired,-and;: I?, think, .. di shear-tens d condi ti-on, were set to dig trenches &quot;and to put up, wire .entanglements, and, &apos;of course, -Sir Robert Bordoncan well understand it was almost asking &quot;too much:: human &apos;nature .   T7e know,  as a fact, that over certain parts of our line- tbe defences were not in the best, &quot;V: condition.    The Officers in many cases had to make a choice either of training, their men       because- hundreds!;,ef. thousands of their own recruits- were in. an untrained-,  condition      or digging trenches.    Some   chose ther .ftlte^r native of dicing trenches,  others ot trainingtheir&apos;men; in eithe-r; case..the men had been brou-schatcht to.; a condition r?hich was most ^deplorable&apos;.   Then the german offensive started, last-March,, and we know the results.&quot;General Smuts also, pointed out,certain advantages that had! been&apos; achieved since,, the., last, session of the imperial war .cabinet including-the...r^reat reduction in the subuiarineperil,   the, establishment-of a single command on the     :&apos;&quot;&apos;Western front,- and the appearance, on the scene of&apos; theAmerican Army.   Mr.. Hughes, who arriveo. after his. colleagues,and had not been present at the earlier Meetings,, &quot;also&quot;&apos;spontaneously and independently asked for more informationas to&quot;the reasons which led up to the strategy which has.:  .. expressed itself in different offensives and indifferent battles on the different fronts.&quot;

5.    The explanations which were asked for in regard tothe Flanders offensive were given partly In the Prime Minis-?-ter*s opening statement and in General smuts  statement atthe Imperial War Cabinet, and partly at the earlier meetingsof the Committee.   In this connection the Prime ministers were furnished with the Report of the Cabinet Committee on war Policy (Paper Ct.-179, dated Ju*y, 1917), which precededthe decision by the British War Cabinet to sanction theFlanders offensive?   this Report contained a very fullappreciation of the military and political circumstances affecting the decision.    It was shown that the FlandorsHe alluded to the entire lack of information in the Dom-inions on this subject^&quot;I do not suggest,,&quot; he said &quot;thst there have beenblunders, I do not say so at all, because I know no-thing whatever about it, except that for four yearswe have been hammering away and we are now where wewore before the battle of the Marne, and perhaps worse,because then we had tremendous potential resources which we had not marshalled, and thus we were well onthe way, but up this time what has happened?   TheGermans have conducted military operations which havebeen almost universally successful and have failedonly to break right through the Western frontj theyhave done everything else.&quot;Mr. Lloyd associated himself generally with the remarksof his colleagues.2. On June 20, on the suggestion of the Prime Minister ofthe United Kingdom, the Imperial War Cabinet decided that:-&quot;The whole issue should be relegated for preliminary discussion to a Committee consisting of the PrimeMinisters, including. General Smuts as General Botha * representative, and the Secretary of State for War,-with the Chief of the Imperial General Staff if hisgjresence was required, and that this Committee should meet without delay.   Any conclusions which the Committeeanight come to should then come back to the imperial war Cabinet for discussion.&quot;   (IAvAC..., .19, Minute 8jvTHE FLANDERS OFFENSIVE AND THE GERMAN

offensive was sanctioned on the unanimous recommandation of the Naval and Military constitutional advisers of the Government; and that these advisers adhered to their recommendations after the Government had expressed considerable misgivings as to the prospects of the offensive (misgivings which, unfortunately, proved completely justified), and after they had been asked to consider alternative proposals. It was further explained that, at the beginning of September, when the Italian successes on the Isonzo afforded an opportunity to desist from the Flanders attack and transfer forces, particularly of artillery, for the exploitation of General Cadorna&apos;s successes, the Military Advisers of the Government rejected this plan and recommended the continuance of the Flanders offensive. After that, it was considered useless, in the face of the military advice, to stop the operations for the capture of Pas?. It was pointed out to the Committee that, if the Government had exerciced their powers in this matter, it would have been said that the operations had been stopped at the very point when the losses and demoralisation of the enemy were about to yield the full fruits of victory.

4. The Committee are agreed that the losses, disappointment and sufferings of our troops in the Flanders operations, dagged, as they were, by incessant bad weather, produced a bad effect on the moral of the British Army, and that this effect was enhanced by the heavy labour involved in constructing new defences on the territory occupied during 1917, and in re-making those which had fallen into diprepair in consequence of the con-contration of effort on the Flanders offensive. Thus, when the German onslought took place on March 21, the Army was not in a good state to meet it.



5.     While this was an important cause of the reverse of Maroh21, there wore many other reasons for our failure.At the point of contact, our forces were vory seriously out-numbered.     The enemy was favoured by exceptionally dryweather for the time of the year,- and by a heavy mist on theday of the attack, which assisted him as it assisted our troops in their recent attack in front of Amiens.     Moreover,some of the defences vAhieh had been taken over from the Frencha few weeks before the attack, wc^e not in a good condition.An even more important cause of this reverse, howeverr was theabsenoo of any properly disposed Allied Reserve on the western front, and this, in turn, was due to the lack of proper unity of Command.     Although the British Government had long aimed at unity of Command, thoir efforts had fallen short of theirdesires and had been delayod owing to military and politicalopposition.     Thus the Allied Armies in tho West came nearer to disaster than at any tino since tho First battle of theMemo in 1914,6,     The measures taken by tho British Government to retrievethe disauter of March  1, were, fortunately, attended with success.     These measures inoluded the emergency steps takento replace casualties and equipment;   the despatch of boysof 16jl into the fighting line;   the drastic combing-out ofindustries;   the passage of the second Military ServiceAmendment Act;    the withdrawal of British troops fromSalonika and Palestine and&apos; thoir replacement in tho lattertheatre by Indian troops;   a successful application to thoItalian Government to send roinforcements from tho italian army;    tho enormous acceleration of the arrival of american troops;   and the imraonoo ro-organisation of our shipping toprovide tho necessary transport across tho Atlantic and theChannel.     perhaps, however, the moot important step wastho appointment of General, now Marshal,/

Foch as General-in-Chief of the Allied Armies on the Westernfroi.it,     Since this Committee was first appointed by theImperial VJar Cabinet, the happiest events, due largely tothese measures, have taken place, and the War has assumeda different aspect, although much remains to be done before final victory is achieved,METHOD   05&apos;   PRQGjsjKTBS.7,     Apart from the brief discuss ions of past events, whichare summarised above, the Committee has devoted its attentionmainly to current and future military policy and organisa-tion, referring to the past only so far as its lessons could-itbo applied to future problems.8.     The A rime Minister of the United Kingdom welcomed thefrank criticisms of his colleagues and deduced from them tholesson that they should share with the British Government,as far as ean.be arranged, the responsibility for the con-trol of military operations in the future.     He proposed thatwith this object in view the Committee should discuss and agree as to the general principles on which our future military $policy should be based as a general guide to be followed inthe months to come, so far as the over-changing circumstancesof war permit.     On this basis the Committee, with thoassistance of the Chief of the Imperial Gonoral Staff, set towork to consider our future military policy, a subject which inevitably involved considerable inquiry into many related matters, such as, the man-power of our Allies and ourselves,,naval, diplomatic, and political -questions.      In thoseconnections the Committee had before thorn, besides the valuable hStatements made by Lord Curia on, Mr, Balfour, the First sea lord, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, Lord Weir,.      &quot;    .    - a &apos;Mr, Churchill, and others at.the Imperial War Cabinet, a large -   jnumber of documents, some of which are alluded to at theappropriate places in this Report. They also heard the evidence  ii of     !?:&apos;   - 1

r   7  -..if several Officers of the General Staff, as well as ofGeneral j,ord Cavan, Commanding tho British force in italy, and Sir Auckland Geddes,  the Minister cf NationalService,9,     The Committee fell hound to point out that their conclusions,  so far as they relate to military policy,  canIbly be regarded as a very general guide, partly for thereason already given,  that the circumstances cf war may at any moment change the whole situation (as indeed has actually occursai since the committee began its Meetings),and partly because the plans of the British Empire mustbe concerted in cluse association with those of their allies.THE POSITION CF GOW-dMLNTS IF THE DIRECTIONCF WAR POLICY *10.    In the course of their inquiries the Committee haveinevitably been confronted with the same difficulty whichthe British Government,  and, indeed, all the Allied Govern-ments have met with throughput the war, in deciding howfar the civilian Heads of a Government are entitled toexcerise control over military policy, and hov: far thisought to be left to the unfettered discretion of military commanders in the field.    Without atte. pting to make any definite statement on the academic aspects of this con-controversial question,  it appears to the Committee, that,at present, &quot; there are certain Incontrovertible principles which should guide the Imperial War Cabinet.    The Govern-ment is ultimately.responsible for the policy adopted.It is also immediately responsible f*r. providing the means whereby the policy is to be carried out; these meansinclude man-power, as well as material.   At the present stage of thb War, man-penr has become the controllingfactor on the handling of which victory or defeat maydepend.    The man-po-wer *f the Allies in so far depletedthat the withdrawal of relatively /

*      I    170small numbers of men from industry,  particularly inGreat britain, is liable to-, jeopardise the production ofthe material means on which the Armies of eurselves andour Allies depend for carrying en the War..   Consequentlyfthe husbanding of our man-power has become a consideration on which the whole future of our Empire depends,   and itis a problem the extreme difficulty and acuteness of whichcan hardly be realised except by those who are ooncernedin it.    Consequently, it is not only the right but theduty of the Government to assure itself that operationsinvolving the probability of heavy casualties are notembarked on unless they give a probability of producingcommensurate results on the final issue of the War andwithout wrecking the future of the Empire.     This doesnot mean that the Government should interfere with theHigher Command in regard to minor operations for therectification of the line,  or the improvement of the tactical position; or that they should hamper it intaking advantage of any opportunity which may arise in thecourse of a battle for an effective counter-atsr&amp;k&amp;j butthey have a right t0 insist that  he general lines of major operations involving the possibility of a heavycasualty list must be submitted for their approval.   this applies equally to those theatres- where the Coromander-in-chief is an Allied Officer,  as in the case of theWestern front and Solonica,  and a^loc to those theatreswhere he is a purely British Officer,  such as Palestine,Mesopotamia,  or Persia.    The Government, indeed, is inthe. position of a Board oof Directors who have to insist that before committing the resources of the company in somegreat enterprise they shall be fully apprised of itsprospects, cost, and&apos; consequences.

9 .THE MEM0RAIg)UM BY THE GENERAL STAFF. (jjMP .7Q)11. -As a basis for their discussions on future military policy, the Committee atfe indebted to the Chief of theImperial General Staff for a most valuable and comprehensive-sive Memorandum (W.P.70)i in which the present situationand future prospects of the War are reviewed in consider-able detail.    -Qw&amp;BfM^-^w gvvmt suwooy thio ducuixienffeaa-vuly been aiwtt-a-ve-ry Iimdfred&quot;-oi*&apos;ouI-aticttt     while they have not been able to accept the original recommend-relations of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff on allsubjects - and he himself has modified this advice incertain particulars as a result of their discussions the Committee wish to place on record their appreciation of the great assistance that the Memorandum has been to them .The original Conclusions of the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff Memorandum were as follows:-   -(i)   At the earliest possible moment we must regain suf-fioient ground in front of the vital points inFrance to free us from anxiety, and enable us tomake satisfactory preparations for our own offen-e i ve,(ii)   Having done this we should husband our resourcesduring the preparatory period, making arrange-ments so that by the end of this period we can een*concentrate the maximum forces in the West, equip themto the fullest extent every mechanical auxil-plenipoteniary, and ensure them the most thorough training before making our supreme effort.     During thisperiod a British reserve of 3 or 4 divisions shouldbe stationed in Italy,(iii)   Although our calculations must nacessarilly be basedon many uncertain faotors, we may reckon on a num-erical superiority of 400,000 rifles by next Julyif things go reasonably well,    In view of this andother considerations^ it would toe unv/ise to defer the attempt to gain a decisive victory until 1920,For purposes of calculation the 1st July 1919 should therefore toe taken as the date toy which all pre-reparations are to be completed for the opening ofthe main offensive campaign.(iv)   Beyond improving our position in Palestine by gain-ing possession of the Hejaz railway about Amman andconsolidating our connection with the Arabs noextensive operations in the subsidiary theatresshould be undertaken during the preparatory periodsBritish formations in Macedonia should be replaced

by Indians as fast as the latter can bo provided and the troops thus liberated employed as seems best to further the main object in view.(v)   The most urgent task in the meantime is the estab-lishment of British control of the Caspian and of a secure lines of communication to it from Baghdad.( vi ) )   looking to&apos;the pjeriod after the war it is imperativefor the future security of Egypt and India, that a wide no man&apos;s land should be maintained between ourpresent railheads in those theatres and those of theenemy while no effort should be spared to buildup behind our present front as complete&apos; and se-cure communications as the means at our disposalwill allow.    l?or it is ultimately on the physicalobstacle presented by that no man&apos;s land and therelative superiority of our communications behindour existing front that the defence of our smpirewill largely depend.(vii)   The re-constjtution of Russia in some form as an armed and independent state, strong enough to with-stand Gorman infiltration and aggression ia a vitalBritish interest.    If the war closes without this being accomplished, the future of the British Em-piro will bo seriously menaced, and we shall ul-timately have to fight at the gravest disadvantage.(viii)   Lastly I am aware that in many of the matters    I havetouched on I have been trenching on the domain ofpolicy, which is beyond the bounds of my responsi-bility.    My excuse for so- doing is that the ultim-ato security of the British Empire depends on theextent to. which British policy and dritish strategyare made to harmonise in defence of British inter-ests.   Unless our strategy is based on a sound,sane and clearly defined foreign policy, the sacrifice-benefices we have made in this war and the efforts viemay put forth in the future will avail us little,it is to policy that we must look to deny the vitallinos of advance to potential enemies, to create the neutral sones and call into being the Bufferdates that will provide the no man&apos;8   land before our outposts and render abortive all hostile inten-tions and activities for years to comb.

This is a question,cf policy mainly for the British Government to decide, but it is one in which the Dominion Governments also have an interest.    The Dominionforces are mainly dependent on British supplies cf  munitions of war&apos;, ineluding life-saving devices such as Tanks and aircraft.    They cannotview without misgivings any policy in regard to British man-power whichin order to supply a relatively insignificant number of recruits forthe British infantry, will involve greater loss of life throughout thewhole army, including the Dominions&apos; contingents owing to the conse-quential reduced output of Tanks etc.    The Prime Ministers of the Dominions therefore.welcome the recent decision that some 550 men, recentlyrecruited,  shall be returned to the manufacture of Tanks .The recent reduction in the output of coal which, is mainly dueto the withdrawal of miners., is -also a matter to which the Dominionscannot bo indifferent, since it has very seriously dislocated shippingprogrammes, and the Dominions depend for their communications on Bri-tish shipping, and have made great sacrifices to release that shipping for the service of the Armies.     Some of the Dominions, Resides suffer-ing severely from an economic and financial point of view, are so hardhit by the shortage of shipping as to threaten a reduction  in their war effort.    The Committee learn that ships are not only held up inports of the United Kingdom waiting for coal, but that convoys are un-able to sail from ports abroad for the same reason,   The Committeetrust, therefore, that full weight will be given to the above considera-tlons in the distribution of British man-power.15.   The Committee are Impressed by the accumulation of evidence inregard to the many claims made on British man-power........,...........

On the one hand, the British Government are const arrtly^pre-s-sed-.by their Allies,  and particularly by the Prench, to maintainthe existing number ef Divisions.   And,  on the other hand,there is no diminution in the demands made by our Allies,great and small, for shipping, repairs, to shipping, coal,steel, woollen geods, railway materiel.,  and all kinds ofmilitary stores and equipment.   The increase to the -American Pleets and Flotillas in European waters makes an ever-heavier demand on British Dockyards for repairs.Owing to the fact that the bulk of submarine losses occur in North European waters, the increase in the AmericanMercantile Marine similarly involves an increased demand foj?repair facilities for American ships.    Only lately america has asked for an increase in the supplies of. British coal.The threat to the Bruay coal-mines involved a great increasein the programme of the supply of coal by Great Britain to france , though this is a demand which, in view of the improvedmilitary position,  should beasd-uced in the near future.Only recently Great Britain has had to supply and ship a strategic reserve of 150,000 tons of coal for Italy,Por the United States of America,  Great Britain has had toundertake a great programme of textile manufacture.    Allthese - industrial claims make both   a direct and an indirectdemand on British man-power: direct,  so far as man-power is      ;lnecessary for the actual manufacture;  indirect,  sc far as it involves the importation of additional raw materials, withan increased burden on shipping, ports,  and means&quot; of inlandtransportation,16.    The Committee consider that these factB should boelaborated and placed before our Allies at the Supreme WarCouncil, and that they should be plainly told that at this -stage of the War it is an impossibility of the BritishGovernment at the same time to continue to maintain its military force on the present scale   /-PART II.

I i v)4. PART. and to furnish this vast assistance for all the Allies. Ifthey can supply themselves, or do without the supplies, then it is possible proportionately to diminish the numbers of divisions that will have to be reduced.   But if they con-slder that they will obtain more assistance from our supplyfacilities, then they must realise that some reduction in our military force&apos; is inevitable.17,   Those considerations, however, will not release theBritish and Dominions/Jovernments from the necessity of doing their utmost to maintain their Divisions and to make themost economical possible use of their man-power.   In this latter connection the Committee have been supplied with threeReports dealing with the labour organisation in the Army inFranco, namely:-A Report on Labour Organisation in Francetby Sir Edward E. Pearson, made at therequest of tbe Secretary of State forWar (0.T.-S190). .A Report upon an Enquiry Into the management of Labour and the Control of Works In theBritish Army Zone in France, by Sir FrankBaines, H.M..Office of Works (G.T.-5173KA Report by Lieut.-Colonel Roure, French Army,on&apos;British Man-Power (G.T.-5277).18.   It would be beyond the scope of this Report to discuss 1;detail the vory large questions raised in these Reports, butthere is this amount of common ground between them, that triemanagement of labour in rear of the British lines is criticised in ell of them and in this respect the Reports are confirmed by information received by the Prime Ministers of the Domin-ions from their own officers In France.   The Committee corn-mend this subject to the British Government for full invest!-gation, wkth a view to such action as may result in a more economical use of the Army&apos;s man-power.

Part II.19.     As regards the man-power of the Dominions, tho Canadian,Australian and How Zealand Divisions are still maintained on the basis of 12 Battalions to a Division, as compared withthe British 9 Battalions.     Tho Committee have assumed that each Dominion will be able to keep its existing Divisionalor Brigade units in being.20. The original estimate of tho General Staff, in their memorandum on Future Military Policy, was that by July, 19the British and Dominion Divisions in Franco would havefallen from their present aggregate of 59 to a total of 44.21.     In view of the considerations in regard to British man-power sot forth above, and the prospect of heavy fighting in 1919, the Committee felt some doubt as to whether our resources of man-power would enable us to maintain so large anumber of Divisions in the Field.     Further, the Committeefolt that it would be highly inexpedient to adopt a higher standard of Divisions than in practice it would be possibleto maintain at full strength..    They would view with dismaya situation in which, at the end of 1919, whether thooperations of the year had been successful or not, theBritish Army would be go completely shattered as to be almosta negligible quantity as compared with the forces of our AlliesOur negotiato&amp;s might find themselves greatly hampered at aPease Conference by the fact that our Army consisted only dfa number of cadre Divisions which it was possible to maintain.As the estimates of the General Staff were based on calcula-tions made at Versailles, the Committee invited the GeneralStaff to re-examine tho whole question with tho Adjutant-general s .Department, and to -present a balanoo-sboet of profitand loss in regard to man-power in connection with the opera-tions contemplated in tho Memorandum on Future Military Policy,ALLIED AMD EU3HY STEEiTGTH IB 1919.

PAR3? II. 17322. - &apos;-according to the revised estimate of the General Staff,the number of British Divisions in France would be as follows:-July 1, 1919    ....   39 Divisions (including 5Divisions of Class B menlDeer.31,1919 36 Divisions (including 5Divisions of Class B men)Tlais allows for British Divisions of a strength nf 900 men in a battalion, or over, and for Colonial Divisions of a strength of1^000 men in a Battalion.. .23.     The Committee consider that it would be wiser to cut thenumber cf Divisions on the Western Front down to 36 (includingCategory &quot;B&quot; Divisions), or such number as the War Office and theMinister of National Service are certain they can maintain&apos;at full strength. - Moreover, if the noeossary personnel is to be providedfor manning the approved programme of Tank construction, it isvery doubtful whether even 36 divisions can be maintained.. Havingregard to.the fact that Great Britain is not only the pioneer,but the largest manufacturer of Tanks and more experienced than anyother nation in their use, the Committee consider it peculiarly ...appropriate that British and Dominion personnel--should be devotedlargely to the manning of this important offensive arm, eventhough it involves a reduction in infantry divisions.24B     Assuming that the number of British Divisions is 36, and assuming that each -ijnerican Division is the equivalent of if-british, .or .German Divisions, a rough calculation \i&apos;ould give thefollowing conroarative strength of the Allies and the enemy on theWestern Front in July,. 1919ALJDI53.

-8- &apos;   PAR? II.This superiority compares with an original estimate in tho GeneralStaff Memorandum of a superiority in rifle strength of 400,000men in July 1919.   These estimates, however,  can only he regardedas a very rough approximation owing to the numerous changing anduncertain factors involved in the calculation, and the Committeeincline to tho view that they over-rate the probable Alliedstrength and underr-rate tho probable enemy strength.26.     2he logical course to adopt, in the view of the Committee, isto fill up with American troops the British and French divisions,which, otherwise, will have to disappear.    The difficulty in form-ing a larger number of American divisions is not lack of troops,or even of troop transports, but an insufficiency of cargo- ship-ping for conveyance of their supplies, equipment, and transport.In the British and French divisions the equipment and transport arealready there, and to supply American troops instead of British orFrench troops will make no greater drain than at present on Britishand French resources.    Further, the trained Commandons and Staffsare there, if the Americans are prepared to utilise them, pendingthe training of Americans sufficiently experienced to take theirplaces.   By this means alone does it appear practicable to produce a sufficient numerical superiority on the leste-rn front to give areasonable prospect of success in 1919, and tho Committee roeommondthat this course should bo urged on tho Supreme War Council.

MILITARY POLICY OF THE WESTERN AND ITALIAN FRONTS FOI. THE REMAINDEN OF 1918.



27. The Committee could not accept without some qualification the advice of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff that ?at the earliest possible moment we must regain sufficient ground in front of the vital points in France to free us from anxiety, and enable us to make satisfactory preparations for our own offensive".

The Committee felt that to initiate any major operations involving heavy casualties would be to report the mistake that was made in the Flanders offensive last year. If we were to make a serious attempt to push the enemy back, it could only result in most bloody fighting. The consequence would be that we should reach the winter in the same conditions as last year when, after a series of continuous small advances, we found ourselves at the end with no sufficient advantage to compensate our losses. If we are to enter upon a great offensive next year we should conserve our Army for that purpose, give it rest, and bring it to the highest possible pitch of training, in order that it may combine with the American Army which is now being built up in whatsoever operations it is decided to utilise it.

28. A further reason in favour of an unaggressive policy for the present results from the consideration of the relative forces of the Enemy and the Allies. The German offensive of the present year has resulted in the formation of large salient which have greatly extended the total length of the line. Hitherto, this has been an advantage to the enemy, and a disadvantage to the Allies, since the enemy on the whole has had a preponderance of strength.

 

2 . PAI lT 1X1 .Every month, however, reduce?; the enemy1:;, preponderance,and somewhere between September and November of 1913, thebalance of advantage should be on the side of the Allier.,and the length of line will become an advantage to theAllies and a disadvantage to the enemy.     Vvhen the enemyrealise? this, it is by no means impossible that he mayadopt the same force as he did at the beginning of 1917,iok fo&apos;Jwhen threatened v/ith General Seville&apos; a offensive, and. with-draw his forces with the object of shortening hio line andavoiding attack. In fact there have already been indica-determination  of movements of this kind. Thus, it. is by no meansunlikely that the Allies may, by waiting, achieve a resultwhich they could only achieve by precipitating the attack.The Committee do not wish to interfere at all with the-discretion of the Higher Command in regard to minor tacticaloperations for the rectification of the line,  which involvethe riok of slight casualties only.     Eeither do they wish-to hamper Marshal Foch in taking advantage a? he&apos;has already done so brilliantly of opportunities offered in the course ofa battle to doal effective counter-strokes.     What they wiehto avoid is the initiation of any offensive operation com-parable with the Flanders attack in 1918 involving protractedfighting and heavy casualties.29.     Tho Committee recommend that Marshal Foch should beasked to keep the British Prime Minister informed, through thChief of the Imperial General Staff, as to all plans, otherthan minor operations,  involving the employment of Britishtroops.THE ITALIAN PROMT30.     Two reasons were brought to the notice of the Committeein favour of an early concentration of allied troops on theItalian front, one defensive, the other offensive.

183Part III.31.    In regard to the former,  it was pointed out that theGermans, foiled in their attempt to smash the western front this year, must do-something to revive the waningspirits bf their people and to restore the prestige oftheir military caste.    It was suggested that nothing was more probable than that they would seek to repeat thisyear the successes they had won in the Italian theatrelast year,  choosing their moment,  as they did in 1917,when it would be too late for the Allies to retaliate.The General Staff and General Lord Gavan both consider-ed that this would be a proper course for the enemy teadopt,  and Signor Nitti, the Italian Minister of Finance^in his recent interviews with Mr. Lloyd George,   made itclear that the Italian Government are apprehensive on the .subject.    Signor Nitti-&apos;s estimates of the Austrian strength which showed a considerable superiority over the allied armies on the Italian front both in men and guns, were notconfirmed by General Sir G. Ilaedonegh,  the Director ofMilitary Intelligence; whoso information as tfs the italian front has in the past proved very reliable.   According toGeneral Macdonoghls estimates there were on July 23rd 59Austrian divisions on the Italian front as compared With56 or 61 Allied divisions,   according as cavalry divisions and Czboho-Slovak divisions are included or not.   There isno- :doUbt, however, that German divisions could be transferrto the Italian front at twice the rate of Allied divisions,and that a first instalment of German divisions (sufficientte &quot;balance the five Allied divisions now on the italian front) might arrive before We obtained knowledge of this move,  and could commence our counter-measures.       TheDireetor of Military Intelligence estimated that within6 weeks a force of 20 German divisions might bo

- 4 - PART III,concentrated on the Italian front by pooling&quot;the German and austrian rolling stock, which is. the limiting factor. Lord&apos;Cavan considered that the allied forces now on the italian front could&apos;withstand an attack by the Austrian Army rein-forced by six German divisions, but   he admitted thatGeneral Grasiaoi Officer Commanding the French Corps did notshare this view, and had little confidence in the capacity Of .Italian troops to withstand a German attack,.   Lord Cavanadded however that the Italians had shown a good deal of grit&apos;In their powers of counter-attack.&quot; In any case Lord Cavanhimself considered that any force beyond six German divisions would have to be countered by a reinforcement of British,,,French, or American troops.   All these defensive consider&quot;ations point to the desirability of an increase in theAllied forces with the Italian Army.32.   As regards offensivW^easons,the Committee were muchattracted by a scheme whlcn was laid before them by Gen-eral Lord Cavan for an offensive on the Italian front this autumn.    The political and economic condition of Austriais such that the conditions might arise any day, If theydo not already exist, favourable to a decisive blowagainst -the Austrian Army.   Lord Cavan explained to theCommittee, however, that a decisive blow could not at present be struck eastwards across the Piave, owing to the danger to which the Northern flank of the Army on the mountainfront Is exposed;-in consequence of the short distancewhich separates- the enemy from the plains.   On the otherhand, no decisive operation is possible on the mountainA i:     j ;::A;&apos; v - -,-        &quot; &apos;;L&apos;&apos; A: la.&quot; jlfront, because, before the Allied Armies could penetratesufficiently far Into Austrian territory, they would

185- 5 - Part III .reach a region of high mountains where movements arerestricted to the narrow valleys, and where,  only a relatively small number of troops can deploy.   As theenemy&apos;s railway communications will be greatly superior to those of the Allies,  even after the completion of the improvements to the Modane route new in progress, asufficient number of German troops could alvays be broughtto the Trentino in time to hold up an Allied advance in these harrow valleys.    In short,  any decisive opera-tion against the Austxaan Army must be directed acrossthe Piave,  and an indispensable condition precedent toany such operation is to secure the Northern flank ofthe Italian Army by a blow.33.   4*t* suggestion -was made that advantage might betaken of the demoralised condition of the Austrian nation and Army to strike a blovr with this objeGt in the presentautumn, thus preparing the way fesr more decisive opera-tions on the Italian front next year if and when theoccasion should arise,   lord Cavan estimated that, inorder to&apos;reach Trent (an undertaking which,  if 3ucoess-ful, would clear up the situation on the mountain front,and in addition deal a heavy blow to Austria   politicallyin her present condition), it would be necessary to re-info rce the Italian Array by 13 British, French ar american divisions,  in addition to the 5 already on theItalian front, making a total of 18 divisions.    If theblow were prepared as a surprise it might be hoped to achieve success before any considerable number of Germanreinforcements could reach the Austrian front, andif the attack was timed to commence late in the autumn,it was probable that snow would set in and there wouldbe no opportunity for a German reaction during thepresent year.

Part in.    jggThe Chief, of the Imperial- Gen&amp;nxl -Staff ^p-maintenance od ,out.,however,  that in ordinary years military operations werenot praoticahle on trie Italian front after the middle ofNovember,  as the snow usually fell in the mountains about that date.    Last year the weatAer conditions werealtogether exceptional,.    It would not be possible beforethe middle of November to release.se from the weatern front the required number of British,  French,   or Americandivision.!,   and,  consequently,  he could hold out no pros-pect cf carrying out the proposed offensive operations in the present year.34.      Certain measures which the Chief of the ImperialStaff -proposed for accumulating a British reserve in italy during the winter months belong rather to theoperations subsequent to 1918 and are dealt with inthat part of the Report.

PART IV.MILITARY POLICY SUBSAQ,U5ffT TO 1918.THE   WESTERN   FRONT.25.    The Committee agree with the general principle enun-eiated by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff in thesecond conclusion of his Memorandum, -that -v   &quot;..........&quot;We should husband our resources during thepreparatory period, making arrangements sothat by the end of this period we can concen-trate the maximum forces in the West, equipthem to the fullest extent,with everymechanical auxiliary, add endure them themost thorough training before making oursupreme effort.......&quot;   1 A36.   They were Unable, however, to&apos; agree without rederve inthe date provisionally fixed by the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff for the commencement of our main&quot;effort.The. moment chosen ia a date during the summer of 1919. AThe Chief of the Imperial General Staff explained to the *Committee that his idea was hot definitely to lay down thatthe decisive battle was to toe commenced at the date men-tioned, tout aather that it Should be regarded as a date to work to.     Unless this was done,  he pointed out, the driveand effort necessary to assemble all the means within areasonable time would not toe fortho&amp;ming.-   The final decision,however, would be postponed until much nearer the date, whenthe Supreme War Council would toe in a batter position to assess the prospects of victory.   Air. Lloyd George reminded187In the interests of secrecy it is thought wiser not to mention the actual date in this Report, as it can be mentioned verbally at the Imperial War Cabinet.

PART IV.- 2&quot; 188the &quot;Committee that a similar response had.invariably beengiven in 1915,  1916 and 1917, when the Cabinet had criticisedthe proposed plans of campaign^ - They had&apos;been told that the attack would be prepared for,   and &amp; final decision postponed .until nearer the date.    In the event, however&quot;, the cabinet had sometimes never been consulted again, but on those occa-sions when as the date approached voices had been raisedagainst the proposed operatic. ,  the Cabinet had been told that it would destroy the moral of the - Army to&apos; desist whenevery preparation had been ma.de.    The latter argument hadbeen used only last August by a representative of the ItalianSupreme Command, when asked, to postpone the attack beyondthe Igonze until Allied heavy artillery could eo-cperate.37,      The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that,in selecting a date in 1919, he&apos;   had made&apos; an assumption that -neither the British nor the French nation&apos; would bo preparedto continue the War until 1920. Without seeking a deciaion in.1919.    The Committee   did not altogether accept this view.Provided that important successes were achieved in one ory^ther theatre of war,  and provided that casualties were, notexcessive,  they inclined to the view that public opinion inthe Allied countries could be sustained by the. hope of almost certain victory to be achieved,&apos; by the accumulation of &apos;overwhelming forces,  in 1920.38,     The Committee agree &apos;c hat.&apos; the We stern Front is the decisive ;Front; but the question,.arises as to whether, unlessthe Eastern Front..1s re-created,&apos; the decisive moment--can bereached-on that Front, irfi.919.    If the Eastern Front, is not.re-created, will the-Aliied forces possess sufficient super-,priority in 1919 to ensure success on the WO3tern front? .According to the calculation in paragraph 24 the most,favourable numerical conditions that can be hoped: for by july,  1919,   are that the Allies will possess the. equivalent -

- 3 - PART IV. , 0 ^-    - - 189of 250 Divisions,  and the enemy the equivalent of 170 Divi-.sions,  American Divisions - &quot;being reckoned as the . equivalent of     Allied or enemy Divisions.    Even i,f this favourable fore-cast iA- roalised,y\the supcriorliAf of the $Hies will be oneof less than 3 to 2..39.      The Committee do.not under-rate the advantages whichthe Allies may hope to derive from a great development of -Tanks,   aircraft,  poison-gas^ . and other improvement s,  as explained to them in the valuable Memoranda and statements ofthe Minister of Munitions. . There is no guarantee,; however,that in twelve months1 time the enemy will not have produced .an effective reply to these developments,  and for this reason...the Committee are unwilling to count too much on thorn.   More-over, the enemy is a past-master in the art of defence, andparticularly of rearguard actions,  and ho possesses a peculiaradvantage in defence that the Allies have never had,  namely,&apos;that he can afford to surrender vast tracts of territorywhenever it suits his purpose. -40.-    Thea Committee, recalled that the Vest or n Front has, sofar,-..- proved the doom of every attempt to reach a decision.The enemy failed at Ypres in 1914 and 1915,  at Verdun in.1916,   and in his recent&apos; offensive in the present year.    TheAllies failed in Artois and in the Champagne,   in 1915,   on.the Somme in 1916;.. and. on the Aisne and in Flanders, in 1917.The American Army,, with its immense reserves of man-power,might be able- to survrvo an unsuccessful or. partially success-ful offensive campaign in 1919.    &apos;*&apos;he same,, however;,  cannot .be said of either the British or the French Armies.    for reasons which have already been mentioned,, the British -empirecannot face the prospect of having the. British Army shatteredby the end of next year.    The whole situation-,  therefore, wilhave to be^carefully reviewed,  in the early months of 1919,in the light of later developments, before a final -decision is taken to commit the British Army to an attack with an

- .4 - PART IV. 190Allied superiority of only 3 to 2.THE RUSSIAN front.41.      The most promising of these developments&apos;,  the possibiliijyof which can at present he -visualised,  is the rc-creationof the Eastern Front and the withdrawal of a substantial number of German Divisions to dealY-with the situation there.Should this occur,  it would seem by no means improbable thatthe- moment for a decisive action on the Western Front might arise in 1919.    It is, however,, too early to make any forecast,The intervention of the Allies at Murmansk and Archangel isunavoidably on so modest a scale as to offer little prospectof success unless combined with a much greater effort throughSiberia.   Up to the present time, President Wilson has not seen his way to consent to, much loss to give adequate materialsupport to intervention by the Allies (in which Japan mustnecessarily play the principal rj^le) on a scale sufficientto ensure success.    The utmost that can be said is that theextraordinarily gallant enterprise of the Czecho-Slovaks doesafford some hope of development which may yet prove aserious embarrassment to the - enemy.42.    Thus it appears t*- the Committee that the futureeperations on the Western Front must turn to-a considerable extent upon events in the East,, the issue of which is not at  -present in sight.    The Committee consider that no opportunity should be lost, to direct the course of events in the East insuch a manner as to embarrass the enemy and cause him to diveifcforces thither... THE ITALIAN FRpBTj.43,      While the position in Russia appears at the present    .     -moment to offer the best prospects of embarrassing the enemy and causing him to withdraw men from the Western Front in larger numbersi- than the Allx-tfs ,. there arc other countries inwhich developments favourable to the Allies may take place...All accounts agree that Austria is embarrassed,  seething with

&quot; 5 &quot; FART IV.discontent/ dcmorali sed,-  and short of food..   It is by nomoans improbable that the psychological moment may arrivefor dealing a decisive blow at Autrtria,.   For this reason the Committee strongly endorse the recommendation of theChief of the Imperial General Staff,  that during the pre-paratory period a British reserve of three or four divisions should be stationed in Italy...   Indeed, the- Committee would welcome airy increase in the number of Divisions to whichthe Chief of the Imperial General Staff could, sec his way iHot only would an increase in the number of British divisions in Italy enable the Allies to talcs immediate advantage of any opportunity offered for an offensive blow od Austria, butif they could be sent,   or even if preliminary arrangementsfor their reception could be made in time,- they would safe-guard Italy against the blow which the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff and Lord Cavan consider may be struck there bythe enemy this autumn.44.      In the same order of ideas,  the Committee consider Lore&quot;Cavan&apos;s proposal a good one, that American Divisions shouldbo sent to the Italian Front.THE BALFANS.45.     The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs hasexplained to the Imperial Jar Cabinet the difficulties,  dueto the ^susceptibilities of our Allies,  in taking any diplo-matic initiative to eliminate Bulgaria, from the ./&apos;ar.Nevertheless,  the &quot;Committee are of opinion that the situationin Bulgaria &apos;should be most carefully watched,- with a view-to diplomatic action, which iaight be preceded or reinforced by military action.

Apart from this, the Committee concurred with theChief of the Imperial General Staff that in Palestine anycontemplated operations should, for the moment,, be limited -in scope.47.   The Coirsnittee have been impressed with the importanceof certain Memoranda circulated to the Imperial War Cabinetby the Admiralty and the Chief of the Air Staff respectively*on the subject of the Petroleum. Situation in the BritishEmpire (G.T. -5267 and. .G.T. -5376), together with such details,as are available as to the reported oilfields of Mesopotamia,and part of Persia (G-.T.-5313),   These Memoranda are stillthe subject of preliminary Departmental investigation, butthe Committee consider that, if there is reason.to believethat the oilfields of Mesopotamia-are likely to prove .of:great importance, and provided that the iailitary difficultties are not excessive,, the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff should conaider the desirability of a further advance in Mesopotamia to bring the oilfields within the *one of;occupied territory.The Committee agree with the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff as to the urgency of esstablisiiing British con-trol of the Caspian Sea, and of a secure line of ooimaunica-tions to it. . They are impressed, however, with the precari-OU3 character of our existing communications with the Caspian,which are expdsed,over a distance of liundreds of miles, toattack from the West.    They would strongly urge the adoptionof measures to safeguard our communications, either by theestablishment&apos; of an alternative and less exposed line or by measures for covering the existing line.

PART     V.SUMMARY Og CONCLiJSIOFo AHS RE C OMMB S D A TI OK S.49.    The Committee Of Prime Ministers present the -followingSummary of Conclusions and Recommendations:-COMMAND AND (1) The principal conclusion which the CommitteeSTAPP OP THEARMY. draw from their investigation of the causes of the reverses which occurred in the spring of the presentyear^ is that too much importance cannot be attachedto the selection of the very best men for the Higher&apos;Commands and Staff of the Army, that is to say, Gen-Army,eral Headquarters, the/Army Corps/and Divisional Com-mands.    The Committee consider that it should be the concern of the iVar Cabinet to strengthen, in every possible manner, the Higher Direction of the Army.(Z) In this connection, the Committee would es-specially commend to the consideration of the WarCabinet,and of the War Office, the further utilisation-tion in the Higher Commands of Officers drawn from civil lifo who have earned distinction in   the War.This practice has produced admirable results in theDominion forces, and the Committee consider thatthose responsible should make it their business tosee that the higher posts are not entirely, or, in-deed, necessarily mainly,filled by professional sol-dlers to the exclusion of civilian soldiers, who nobonly now form the bulk of the Army,  but include thebest intelligence of the nation,(3) At the present stage of the War, man-power hasPRINCIPLES GOV-ERNING THE CON-become the principal factor, on the judicious alloca-TROL OP MI LI T-ARY OPERATIONS,tion of which, between the Fighting,- Supply, and   \Transport Services, the final issue of the War may

(Paragraph,10).&apos;(6) The supply of modern mechanical devices, suchas Tanks, Aircraft, &amp;e* , designed to increase theefficiency of our operations and to reduce casual-ties, is a matter..of the first importance to theforces of the -Dominions as well as to those of theUnited Kingdom..   As the British Government&apos; supplies the bulk of these

A-188weapons, it is.an imperial interest that in its dis-tribution of British man-power, the British Governmentshould not unduly reduce the output of these machines,,The same principles apply in regard to shipping,  ship-building, tie output of the coal required for the full use of our shipping   and war material generally-, on whichthe Dominions, are mainly dependent on British supplies.(Paragraph 14 ).(7)   The British Government should carefully invest!-gate the question of the use of labour behind the lines and take such steps as appear to them best calculated to secure&apos;its more economical utilisation (Parograph 18),18)   The Dominions will do their utmost to maintainexisting units in the fields (Paragraph 19).(9)   The general British situation in regard to man-power should be placed before the Supreme V.&apos;ar Council,and our Allies should be informed that it is no longer possible simultaneously to maintain the British Army inthe field at its present strength and to furnish ship-ping, coal,  steel, textiles, fabrics., and other war sup-plies on the present scale, (Paragraph 16 )-.STRENGTH 05* (10)   A situation should not be allowed to develop byFORCES IN193 9,       the end of 1919 in which,  whether the VJar is won ornot, the British Army will be so shattered as- to have become an inconsiderable factor in the military situa-tion.

6 fQQX w t/PART V. CONCLUSIONS.(19) While holding that the Western Front is the decisive front,,the Committee consider it premature at present to endeavour to say whether tho decisive moment for the culminating attack by the Alliescan be reached in 1919.(SO) Eather than run the risk cf a failure to reach a decision onthe Western front in 1919, with its disastrous results on the moral of the British and French, and je rhaps even of the American Armies,the Committee would prefer to postpone the attempt until 1920.    they believe that the spirit of the allied peoples could be sustained through1919 by tho hope   of a crushing victory in 1920, provided that the enemy on the Western front is continually harassed; that the casualties are&apos; not  jexcessive; and that there arc successes elsewhere..   (Paragraphs. 36 to 40).&apos;&apos;(21) The final decision as to whether the decisive moment for anattack on the Western front can be reached in 1919. will depend largely on the measure of success which attends the efforts now being made torecreate an Eastern front, and every possible stimulus should be givenio these efforts.    The decision as to the date of the culminating at-tack on the Western front should be postponed until the situation in VRussia is clearer.. &apos; (paragraph 42 -)(22)  In the meantime, the. situation in Austria, Bulgaria, and turkey, should be carefully watched, with a   view to advantage beingtaken of any opportunity for combining military and diplomatic action for the elimination of any of these countries from the War.;,, thus   knock-ing away some of the props on which Germany.rests.

7(23) With a view to taking advantage of such an op-opportunity,  the Committee support the recommendation ofthe Chief of the Imperial General Staff that 3 or 4additional British divisions should he sent to Italyduring the period of preparation for the final attack.The Committee would welcome any Increase that could he made to this number of British divisions,    They also consider it desirable that American divisions shouldhe sent tu Italy&apos;.    If possible,  some of these divi-sions should proceed to Italy before winter sets in,in order to safeguard the Italian front against an at-tack there this autumn, which the General Staff considerprobable.    If - divi sions cannot be sent,  arrangements should, if possible, be made beforehand for their re-ception.  (paragraph/43 and 44) .(24)  Subject to the passibilities of oombining milit-ary and diplomatic Action referred to in Conclusion (20),na extensive operations should be undertaken in the Bal-kan theatre^  and British troops in Mesopotamia shouldbe replaced by Indians as fast as the latter can be pro-vided,  the British troops thus liberated being employed as seems best to further the main object in view,(paragraph 45 ),the(25) Similarly,  in/palestine theatre,  subject tothe same possibilities,  operations should,  for the mo -ment, be. limited in scope. (paragraph 46).(26) ,J-&apos;he chief of the Imperial- General Staff should consider the desirability of employing our superiority of force in Mesopotamia for an exploitation of the mil-itary situation so as to include the principal oil-bearing regions within the sphere of occupied territory,-provided that this can be effected Without imposing anyexcessive military burden. (Paragraph 47),

The Committee attach great importance to the early establish-nent of British control of the Caspian Sea, and of a secure linesof communication to it.    They urge the development of  a saferlines of communication than the one at present available.(Paragraph 48) .($6) The Committee attach Importance to the intensification of aerial warfare,, particularly so far as this can be directed to the bombing of German townsr by which means alone it appears at presentpracticable to force the German people to experience the worsthardships of modern warfare, and to realise v/hat the future has instore for them if the War is continued.(S7) Economic measures are, perhaps, outside the scope of this inquiry.   The Committee, however, are impressed by the apprehensionseconomicwhich exist in enemy countries in regard to their post-bellum   .outlook, and they trust that every possible means will be adopted to take advantage of and interreify these apprehensions by propaganda and otherwise,10, In presenting the above Summary of Conclusions and Recommendations, thepmittee wish to emphasize that they must necessarily be subject to altera-jjioa as new conditions supervene, and to modification to meet the views ofgur Allies.   They also wish to place on record their appreciation of thejn/e success which has attended the war effort of the British Navy;    ThisiEnabled them to base the whole of their enquiry on the assumption thatJtemaritime communications of the Allies are secure.   On the maintenance&apos;this security the whole cause of the Allies depends, and no risks inIMs respect must on any account be run.ilhitehall Gardens, S.W,list 14th* 1918.
