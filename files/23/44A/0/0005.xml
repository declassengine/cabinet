Aftersment south-is of Brit- Field Marshal sir Douglas Haig returned from an interviewI Divisions. -with General Foch at Mouohy, near Beauvais, General smuts had had a long talk with him and General Lawrence,   Hehad also had a talk with General Cox, the Head of the intelligence Service at G.Ho  o   Field Marshal Haig thentold General Smuts that on Friday night General Fooh had formed the judgment that the great danger to the AlliedArmy was -fee- the -53ae* in the Champagne^&apos;&apos;&quot; The Field Marshalhad formed the ^impression that General Fooh had, for themoment, lost, his head in his alarm at this situation.   Q&amp;reconstruction .,1SatoxEday, we /ordered 4 British divisions to proceed southto the region of Chalons, and 4 more to be held in readiwness to go South.   Before this he had already orderedsoJATIOE OE        (1) The Chief of the imperial General staff reportedWESTERNIT. that the enemy had gained a little more ground west ofEheims, comprising a maximum advance of about 2 miles ona front of about 7 or 8 miles.   With regard to the claim in the German wireless that they had captured 13,000prisoners, he said this was no great matter if the at-x tack was on an 80 kilometre front.   If the real fight-ing was being done on a 25 kilometre front only, itwas fairly serious.    The attention of the imperial warCabinet was drawn to a telegram from General du Canestating that General Foch was very pleased with the re-suit of the first attack, that he considered that theenemy had suffered very heavy losses, that the hour of attack had been given away by deserters and prisoners,and that the situation of the Germans was somewhat sinwilar to that of the French in April 1917 after GeneralEivelle*s initial attack had been held up*

practically all the French reserves Jsei^waae^s:.   On re-ceipt of this information the Field Marshal had writtena letter to General Fooh, the gist of vdiich was that he did not know on what information General Foch was acting;that after the assault in the Champagne the main attackmight fall on the British Army; and that he was not in-clined to fall in with General Fooh*s views until he had had a personal interview,   These were the circumstancestheunder which/Field Marshal had met General Foch at Mouchy.By that time General Foch had, to some extent, changedhis view.   He told Field Marshal Haig that he always hadthe contingency of an attack on the centre between theBritish and French Armies in mind; that he was now inclin-ed to think that the danger of the attack. East of Rheimshad been exaggerated; and that he was moving his reservesbackllasst/of Rheims; he was also changing the place of concentration of the British reserves to somewhere in rear of the French Armies about Chateau Thierry, and was notsending them to Chalons.   General Foch had promised tokeep the British divisions together, and, if possible,in reserve, so that they could be brought back rapidly inthe event of danger to Field Marshal Haig.   He had alsoordered S divisions to be held in readiness south of theMarne.   In view of the changed situation, Field MarshalHaig had felt satisfied sdfcfefc: that, the British Army was notplaced in danger, as its reserves could be brought backvery rapidly, and he had sent 2 divisions South of theSorame.   The Field Marshal personally had inclined to theview that the principal attack would be made on his frontomiring the last fortnight, however, there had been indi-indications of 9 divisions being moved from prince Ruppreoht*reserves towards the Crown PrinceTs Army, and 7 out ofthese 9 had already been identified in the present battle,3.

Hence, the attack on the British front could not he so great as had been expected.General Smuts then said that the figures of the Germanreserves given by G.H., differed entirely from those given by General Macdonogh.   According to G*H.Q. * PrinceRuppreoht had only S3 fresh divisions in reserve, comparedwith 33 given by General macdonogh.   General smuts had pressed General Cox very closely on this point, and Goner-.al Cox had had no doubt whatsoever as to the accuracy ofhis information after the removal of the 9 divisions.General Cox had said that for any offensive prince Rup-precht had to rely on the divisions in reserve, for evi-dence had accumulated that the 18^/German divisions in line were of no value for an attack.   They had been bat-tered about and were short of establishment and only fit tohold the line.   He was convinced that the Germans reliedfor their offensives on the fighting troops in reserve.   Hehad also pointed out that, in the event of an attack onthe Somme, the French reserves could oome to our assist-anoe.   Field Marshal Haig and General Lawrence had said they had received many indications that German man-power was failing.   The result of this conversation had been to reassure General Smuts considerably.in the course of the conversation General Smuts had pointed out that our troops could afford to give up no ground, and Field Marshal Haig and General Lawrence hadconcurred in this view.   They had also stated that if theGermans were to advance 10 miles in the region of ChateauThierry they would be in a position to bombard Paris.Similarly, an advance of 10 miles on the British frontwould place us in great difficulties, but in the area where the Germans had made the /a*eeea3&amp;/advanoe, it was not so serious.   They had said that the presence of the Ameri-cans4o

had had a remarkable effect in stimulating the Frenchmoral, Field Marshal Haig doubted if theFrench Array/hard&apos;&quot; any&quot; offensive $dmesf left.in the disoussion on this part of General smuts  state-ment, it was pointed out that the reassuring statement ofField Marshal Haig and General Lawrenoe indicated an en-tirely new attitude on their part.    It was generally agreedthat the doubts expressed regarding the fighting powersof the French Army might be discounted, as all through theWar there had been a tendency on the part of both theBritish and the French Armies to belittle the fightingvalue of the other.lord Milner and the Ohief of the imperial GeneralStaff undertook to get to the bottom of the differ-enoe between the information at G.H.Q., and theWar Office in regard to the strength of the german army.irican (3) General Smuts said that he had also disoussed withiperationoField Marshal Haig the proposal that additional american divisions should be brought behind our front for training.The Field Marshal agreed with the letter which general wilson had sent to General Foch.   -He had found general foch/well disposed towards the idea, and the Field Marshaladvised that, in these circumstances, it would be better not to press the matter/.As General Fooh was much pre-occupied with the conduct of the battle, General smuts had concurred in this view, and had felt it advisablenot to proceed to General FochTs Headquarters.   field marshal Haig had told him that he had also disoussed withGeneral Fooh the question of sending American artillery tojoin the infantry and machine-gunners of divisions alreadybehind the British front, and General Foch had agreedthat the artillery of 4 out of the 5 divisions now behind the British front should be sent.   He understood that the artillery of the 5th.division was not yet available. Tbe

understanding was that the British were to supply horsesfor the guns, the French not being in a position to do so.The withdrawal of the D.A.2T* f to the south had weakenedthe Belgians, who had asked for help even if it was onlythe assistance of some heavy guns.   Field Marshal Haighad given the Belgians some heavy guns, and General smuts had suggested to him that some of the American ^artillerypersonnel might be sent to assist the Belgians.   GeneralLawrence had expressed the view that the new American di-visions would not be useful for some time, as the latestarrivals were quite untrained and, for the most part, hadnot fired a shot in their/training.in the discussion on this part of General smuts&quot; state-ment, it was pointed out that there had been a tendencyon the part of the British and French High Commands tounderrate the value of the Americans.   General retain had expressed just the same sort of views in the presence ofGeneral  ershing.Mr. Hughes said that this had probably had an adverseinfluence on General perching, and was perhaps one of thereasons why General Pershing was reluctant to allow Amer-ican troops to go into action until they had received fur-ther training.   General Pershing had expressed views ofthis kind to him personally.(4) General Smuts said that, in the course of his eon-versation with Field Marshal Haig, the question had arisenas to the Field Marshal&quot;s exact position vis-a-vis GeneralFooh.   Field Marshal Haig had expressed the view that hewould be wrong to hold up any movement of divisions byGeneral Foch1s&apos;orders until he had protested, even if hethought the safety of his Army was compromised.   He had informed General Smuts that a meeting had taken place6.

at the French Ministry of YJar on the 9th June,at whiohLord Milner and the Chief of the Imperial General staff had been present.    On that occasion General Foch hadprotested that he could not exercise the powers of general in-Chief unless he was sure that his orders would beoveyed.   The upshot had been that Field Marshal Haig had understood that his position was to obey his orders andto protest, if he considered necessary, afterwards.The Prime Minister then read the text of the BeauvaisAgreement&quot;General Fooh is charged by the British, French, and^American Governments with the coordination of the ao-tion of the Allied Armies on the Western front,   tothis end all powers necessary to secure effectiverealisation are conferred on him.   The British, Frenchand American Governments for this purpose entrust toGeneral Foch the strategic direction of military op-considerations.I&quot;8ommanders-in-Chief of the British, French,and American Armies have full control of the tacticalemployment of their forces.   Each Commander-in-Chiefwill have the right of appeal to his Government if inhis opinion the safety of his Army is compromised byany order received from General Foch.&quot;This, he pointed out, seemed to make it clear that if the safety of the Army was compromised, the Commander-in-Chief would of necessity appeal, and he could not carryout instructions which appeared to him to endanger the safety of his Army.    He supported this view by the fol-lowing from his own statement recorded in the proc$sverbal of the Beauvais Conference fl.C.55).-w0f course, if General Foch should put the British^Army in great peril, Field Marshal Haig would appealto his own Government, and no paper that could bedrawn up could prevent this.    Consequently, therewas no objection to some words being put in to this effect,   unless he had the necessary power, however,General Foch would prove worse than useless.&quot;Lord Milner said his recollection of the Conference ofJune 9, was that General Foch had never made any formal protest against the Beauvais Agreement.    The question heraised was, if it was a matter of urgency, what was to happen?   If there was no time to appeal, was Field Marshal7o

Haig to act at once or not?   His recollection had &quot;beenthat Field Marshal Haig had agreed that, in such a case,he would, in fact, proceed to carry out the instructionsat the same time as he made his protest.    It had been pointed out, however, that the case was a very unlikely to arise, and it did not appear to have arisen in thepresent case, as there had been time for Field Marshal tosee General Fooh before the movements had taken plaoe.His own view was that the protest should be confined tothose cases where the British Army was put in an unreason-ably perilous position, but unless this reserved rightwas had recourse to only in oases of the greatest emer-genoy, it would ruin the whole arrangement *   His own in-structions to Field Marshal Haig had been issued afterthe Conference on June 9, and these were perfectly clearas to Field Marshal HaigIs position^Che Prime Minister agreed in lord Milner*s view, but said that this assumed that General Foch was allowed toact entirely on his military judgment and was not inter-interfered with by the French Government.   In the recent instancestrangeit appeared to him very B&amp;naBpkgE that General Foch shouldhave changed his mind so suddenly without any new faotsbeing before him, and It was difficult to resist the sus**pioion that political influence might have been brought tobear on him.Lord Milner pointed out, however, that the information was constantly changing, and this was very likely thereason for General Foch changing his mind.General Smuts said that, in his conversation with field marshal Haig, he had felt that the Field Marshal had mis-read the Beauvais Agreement, and he had asked him to showhim his instructions from the Secretary of state for war0

Field Marshal Haig had then produced these instructions,which had showed quite definitely that if he thought the safety of the British Army was compromised, he should ap-peal before obeying his instructions,   on Field MarshalHaig pointing out that these instructions were in con-flic t with the understanding of June 9, General smuts had told him that he felt sure he ought to act on his instructions-tions.Mr0 Hughes insisted on the great importance of makingquite sure Field Marshal Haig realised what his position was.   It was evident that the Beauvais Agreement was not an easy matter to Interpret; Field Marshal Haig would nat-urally look at it from the point of view of a soldier andnot from that of a lawyer.Lord Milner said that Field Marshal Haig*s instructions were so definite that they could really leave no possibleroom for doubt, and General Smuts agreed in this view.Lord Milner said he had always realised that a difficult situation might conceivably arise out of these instructions-tions, and.his own view was that,if there was not time to protest, Field Marshal Haig should obey.^ 6? -tfi*4A4&amp;A*?(5) There was a short discussion as to the question of intervention in Russia.   It was pointed out that there wasno time to be lost if intervention was to take place, andthat every delay was dangerous.   The Chief of the ImperialGeneral staff said he had $ust received a telegram from the.British Military Hepresentative at Washington to the effectthat president Wilson had just reached a decision as regardsMurmansk and Siberia, and that it would be communicatedimmediately to Lord Heading.   The Amerioan Chief of theGeneral staff had notified him that any United states troops allotted to the Murmansk operations would be drawn from General Pershing^s Command, and that General pershingwould arrange details*        q

The Prime Minister pointed out that we were sending a battalion from Hong Kong, and the French a battalion from their Eastern possessions, the United States were( getting troops ready in the Phillipines, and rifles andammunition were being sent by the Japanese, Americans and ourselves to assist the Czechs at VladivostooiuSir Robert Borden said that Canada had offered to send3 battalions.13hitehall Gardens, S.W. *July 17, 1918.
