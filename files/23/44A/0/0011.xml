-ion11 SWES.TEEKT (1) The Director of/Operations said that there was notvery much nev/s beyond what had already been published.GermanThe line was now steadying down.    31/di vis ions had &quot;been engaged in the recent battle.    Of these EO had been in theline and 11 had been brought up as reinforcements, name-ly, 1 from Flanders, 1 from the Lille region, 3 from Ar-tois, and 6 from close reserve.    Rupprecht still had 15fresh divisions in reserve, some of which must be either in or immediately behind the new front, so that he couldnot have more than 8 or 10 left for any offensive opera-tion, and this number was not large enough for any bigrdattack.    Only one regiment of the 33 divisions of american troops had been engaged.   Apart from this the whole ofthe American divisions behind our lines were intact.   TheAllies had probably put in about 31 divisions, namely,17 French and 14 British, but the number&quot; might be rather less.    General Du Oane had mentioned in a letter reoeiv-ed this morning that the attacks by the French South ofMontdidier had been made entirely by divisions in line.Marshal Foch&apos; attributed their success to the bad moral ofthe German divisions in line, which had been starved ofdrafts in order to keep up the divisions reserved for at-tacking purposes.    The same applied, to some extent, tothe divisions opposite the British front of attack, but...&quot; &apos; ..these had been rather more ready owing to the recent ac-tivity in that region.In reply to Mr. Hughes he said that the resistance nowbeing encountered was fairly stiff.    The Germans werejust pushing in divisions as they arrived in exactly thesame manner as we had done after the reverse of March  1.The line would probably now become stabilised.a.

19 016 0The result of these operations would he entirely to relieve Amiens from all bombardment, except that of very long range guns, and traffic could now be resumed throughAmiens and- by the main line to Paris.   Even the Montdidierline would now be available for purposes of local supply,as it was not under observation by the enemy and was sev-eral thousand yards from his lines.Sir Robert Borden mentioned that he had received a full report on Saturday sent by aeroplane from the CanadianCorps.    The surprise at that time had been so completethat some of the German batteries had been captured withtheir muzzle caps still on.ItfGRATHLATIOHS    (2) The Committee of Prime Ministers decided that.-FIELD MAR-SIR DOUG- The Chief of the Imperial General Staff, in(3 HAIG.                         the name of the Imperial War Cabinet, should send congratulations to Field Marshal sir douglas Haig,and the troops under his Command,for the brilliant operation just completed.^DALTIES. (3) Lord Milner said that, according to an estimate from .H.Q., just received,  the British casualties amounted to20,000 men.    Canadian casualties amounted to 7,000.    this figure compared with 2,500, as reported to Sir Sobert Bor-den on Saturday, but it was presumed that the difference was due to the heavy fighting at Lihons, where the Ger-mans had delivered strong counter-attacks.    The British,divisions,which had suffered the heaviest casualties, werethe 58th, the 18th, and the 32nd.    The total British forceengaged was probably about 150,000 men, and 20,000 casual-ties, after 4 days1 fighting, 45 per cent, of which mightbe expected to return, was not generally considered a heavy casualty list by comparison with previous attacks.Mr. Hughes took a rather different view from his col-leagues, and considered that these casualties were fairlyheavy.    He pointed out that they would probably be in-creased

after the German counter-attacks.Lord Milner pointed out that the British forces had captured as many prisonergas they had casualties, and thatthe German casualties on this occasion were undoubtedlymuch heavier than ours.    General Macdonogh had reportedthat 8 German divisions were believed to have been praot-ically knocked out and reduced to cadres, necessitatingtheir returning to Germans/to re-fitoIn reply to Mr. Hughes, General Radcliffe said that since the German attack, which had been followed by ISar-shal Poch^s first counter-attack, the enemy had engagedover 100 divisions; that is to say, more than half histotal force. *LEGED 2RANS- (4) She Prime Minister drew attention to a telegram fromEE OP GERMANIVISIONS TO     Copenhagen according to which the Germans had been com-HE EASTERNOHS. pelled to withdraw 5 divisions from the Western to theEastern front.RANSPORSASION (5) She Prime Minister said that he had received inform-1 PRANCE.   .ation to the effect that M. clemencoau  had taken the wholeof the transportation of the Prench Army out of the handsof the Military and put it under Civilian control.    In his judgment this was a right and proper course.    M. ClaveiLle,who had now control of the Prench transportation, knewmuch more about the subject than any soldier.-   Our recenttendency, unfortunately, had been in the other direction.When Sir Eric Geddes had been in charge of transportationat the front, he had practically been given a free hand.He put it for the consideration of his colleagues that we ought to reconsider the matter on very large lines, name-ly, to put under civilian control all the services of theArmy for which a soldier was not absolutely necessary. Ifwe had first-class brains among our Officers, they oughtto be used for the fighting Services.    She corollary to

this was that the whole of the organisation of the rearServices should he under civilian control, for example,transportation, supplies, and the Adjutant General1s De-partment.    She Canadian General, Stewart, had lately saidthat we oixght to get a good deal more out of our labour. (Sir Robert Borden said  5 per cent.) - At present thedistribution of labour was under the Adjutant General, andall reports agreed that it was not very well done. Conse-quently, he thought we ought to get a first-rate civilianto undertake this rather than take a first-class soldierout of the fighting line for the purpose0lord Miner asked that, before the matter was proceed-ed withy further, he might have an opportunity of talkingto the Prime Minister alone on the question. A good manychanges had already been made, and others were in contem-contemplation. In principle, he agreed with the Prime minister that the man at the top must be an absolutely first-classman, but he Y/ould first like to discuss it with the PrimeMinister.She Committee of Prime Ministers agreed thats-Shis question should be discussed, in thefirst place, between the Prime Minister andthe Secretary of State for War.(6) She Prime Minister suggested that as M. GlaveHle^snew position would virtually give him considerable controlover transport and supply in Prance, we ought to insist that the whole of the shipping transport should be placed under a British Controller, in a corresponding position,and he thought Sir Joseph Maclay would be the best choicefor this post.   We were entitled to this as, according to information he had received from Sir Joseph Maclay that morning, we were giving up 250,000 tons of freightageevery month to set free tonnage for the transport,of stores for the American Army.    Shis hit, not only the

Mother Country, hut the Dominions,very hard.    It was re-ported that, while we were making these great sacrifices,the Americans were continuing In trades that we had given up during the War.    Also it was notorious that the Frenchdid not handle their shipping in an economical manner. he himself had proposed that this question should he discuss-ed at the Supreme War Council, and he had invited M. Clem-enceau to come to London for the purpose.   M. Clemenceau,however, wished to send M. Tardieu and Mo Pichon to dls-cuss the whole shipping question.    This would be of no value whatsoever, and he proposed to send a very full tel-egram to Mo Clemenceau, setting forth the position.Mr. Hughes pointed out that Australia was being verybadly treated in regard to oil and petrol in consequenceof a revision of the export licences system in the UnitedStates of America.    Aocording to an Australian Agent inthe;United States of America, the Americans were turningout ships very fast, but they were unable to turn outengines for them, and consequently there was a great dealof delusion in the American shipping figures.   His view wasthat our best plan would be to say that the appointment of&quot;&quot;MsClaveille was a very good idea whioh should be extendedto shipping by the appointment of a British Minister tobe in charge of All allied shipping arrangements.Mention was made of the Inter-Allied TransportationCouncil, which had been formed for the purpose of dealingwith inter-allied shipping problems, and it was suggast-ed that the question might be referred to this body.The Committee of Prime Ministers agreed that:-The Prime Minister should send a telegram toM* Clemenceau setting out the whole position,,(Mr. Balfour and Lord Robert Cecil-  .    entered at this point)a

iGS PROPA- (7) Mr* Hughes drew attention to a telegram from the3DA IH THE[TED STATES   British Embassy In Washington in regard to peaoe pro-oa-AMERICA.ganda in the United States of America0   He had himself^ heard from Mr, Crawford vaughan, who looked after Austral-ian interests in the United States of America, that therehad been a rapprochement between Mr. Hurst and the Demo-cratic Party, and the Democratic Funds were available forthis propagandaoMr, Balfour said that he had already telegraphed toask for further details.OHO- (8) The Director of Military Operatapns, in reply to theYAKS.Prime Minister, said that the position of the Czecho-Slovaks was probably not quite so bad as either the Japan-ese or ourselves were making out.Mr. Balfour said that President Wilson was suspectingthis , and believed that we were trying to manoeuvre himinto a big expedition into Russia by exaggerating thedanger to the Czecho-Slovaks.   It was undoubtedly our policy to try and get President Wilson to agree to actionin Russia on a large scale, but it was important not to let him see that we were doing so.Lord Robert Cecil said that, on Saturday, he had beena good deal alarmed about the position of the Czecho-Slovaks; this alarm was due to the fact that the note of danger came,not from the Japanese, but from General Die-trichs, who commanded the Czeoho-Slovaks.Lord Milner pointed out that the position might be serious in the East and yet be much better in the Yfest.In this connection General Smuts drew attention to an   -article In a German newspaper reproduced in the eveningpapers, according to which ftfrwargr nm 300,000 russians had joined the Czecho-Slovaks, and Lord Robert Cecil

stated that it had been announced officially that the Ger-man mission had been withdrawn from Moscow.lord Robert Cecil said he was disconcerted at the man-ifestations of growing difficulty at Vladivostock betweenthe British and American representatives. Among these he mentioned:--(1) Ihe criticism of the American Proclamation:(S) She trouble there had been over martial law whichall the Allies except the Americans had wished to proclaim:(3) The proposal of our representative that native la-bour should be used to repair the railways and hisremark that it had best be done without tellingthe Americans.All these were indications of a growing irritation w with the Americans,   This was very serious, as we did not wishto have friction with the Americans,   He had had an hourand a halfAs talk with lord Reading, and had discussed aproposal to ask the Americans to content themselves withholding Vladivostock, while giving the rest of the Alliesa free hand in Siberia0    lord Reading, without being en-thusiastic about this proposal, had not definitely ex-cluded it.Mr, Hughes suggested that the only course that wouldbe of any value would be to get Japan to send the necess-ary troops*Lord Robert Cecil said that the Japanese wished to keepwith the Americans, and, if possible, to divide us alittle from the Americans * at any rate to prevent our hav-aing/common policy in the Pacific.General Radcliffe, in reply to the Prime Minister, saidthat no military assistance could be given by India, Itwould be possible to send a division from Mesopotamia,It was generally agreed, that:-.Until the Caspian situation had been cleared up no troops should be sent from Mesopotamiato Siberia.

(9) Mr. Balfour said he was anxious about the position at Archangel.    General Poole was apparently trying toreach Vologda.    His aim was to induce the local popula-.tions to rise, and, to some extent, they seemed to haveresponded.    His position, however, would depend entirelyupon the extent to which he could feed the local popula-tion.lord Robert Cecil said that General Poole was hopingto open up communication up the River Pwina to Viatkawith a view to securing communication with Western Siberia,in which case 3as: ample stocks of food would become avail-able.General Radcliffe said that the Czeeho-Slovaks were atEkaterinburg.    Between them and General Poole there wasa big block of Bolshevists.    One of General Poolers recent telegrams, however, had opened up the possibility of a ris-ing in Perm in favour of the Allies.The Secretary notified the Prime Ministers that, at thelast Meeting of the War Cabinet,  (WffldiiMtti War Cabinet 455,Minute 4.) the Chief of the Imperial General Staff had stated that he was In communication with the ShippingController with a view to transporting food, which was available in America, to Archangel, and he had stated he did not want a decision of the War Cabinet.The Prime Ministers then left the question on the un-derstanding that the Chief of the Imperial General staff had It in hand.(10) The Prime Minister said there were many indica-tions that Germany was getting very anxious about theEastern front, and it seemed probable that they had somenews that was lacking to us.l9rd Robert Cecil said that Mr. Basil Thompson of9o

Scotland Yard had sent him a copy of a speech made fey aBolshevist who had recently arrived from Russia, who hadtalked in terms of great pessimism ahout the Bolshevistprospects, and had said that the Monarchists were the only alternative to the Bolshevists.   Attention was also drawn to the newspaper stories that Lenin and Trotaki had fled.Mr. Balfour, in reply to the Prime Minister, said he hoped that Mr. lockhart would escape any mishap.   We hadthreatened reprisals on M. Litvinoff.The Prime Minister pointed out that Mr. Lockhart had had relations with the enemies of the Bolshevists, andhad actually given money to General Aleseieff, and if this were discovered fey the Bolshevists his position would bea very dangerous one.(11) Mr. Balfour called attention to the action of theFrench in sending persons of French nationality to recruitin Ireland for labour purposes in France.   He pointed outthat evex^y Irishman in France would be a propagandistagainst Great Britain, and they might have a good deal of influence particularly among the priests of Irish extraction-tion,She Prime Minister considered that the prospects of anyIrish labourers being obtained was remote.   Would it notbe better, he asked, to let the French see for themselveswhat a difficult problem we had to deal with in Ireland?Mr. Balfour agreed that, if the French failed to obtainassistance in Ireland, the policy was a safe one, and inthat oase he would be satisfied,(IS) At the conclusion of the Meeting the Prime Ministerinstructed the Secretary to ascertain from the War Offioethe number of men in a lank battalion.   He wished the WarOffice to consider the possibility of forming British

fillTank divisions.    He pointed out that certain Armies had&quot;been famous for cavalry divisions.    The Russians, for in-stance, had at one time had a very large proportion ofcavalry0   He suggested in the same manner that the british army might he composed, to a large extent, of Tank divi-sions, and he wished a scheme to he drawn up for doing this,IaIiAHOB (13) The Committee of Prime Ministers agreed that;-OF?OWER. The Balance Sheet of Man-Power, circulatedby the Chief of the Imperial General Staff(W.P971), should be discussed, in the firstinstance, between the Prime Minister of theUnited Kingdom, the Secretary of State forWar, and the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaffolitehall Gardens, S.W.,August IS, 1918.llo
