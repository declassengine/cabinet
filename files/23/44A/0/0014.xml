A E T.IMPERIAL CABINET       A.DRAFT MINUTES of a Meeting held at 10 2tewnifl  Street,SAW.on WEDNESDAY, KOVEM.BEE fa  19l8s  at 12 Noon.IS WESTERN (1)   The - Director of Military Operations said that toeiONT.westher during the last day or two on the Western front had bean very, bad, and the roods consequently were, very heavy, but that the Germans generally were retreating very rapidly.     Our troops had. now cleared the Morraal *orest,and were well aeroas the Sarabre, and were now getting closeup to the railway upon which the enemy were dependent fortheir supplies.     This railway lost its value as a lateralcommunication the nearer ire approached it.     The situationwan highly satisfactory, and our casualties during the lasttwo days had been unusually light.RUSTICS. (2)&quot; With reference to Imperial War Cabinet 3.6, Minutelitory the Imperial War Cabinet had before them a map which hadnditions.been prepared by the Director of Military Operations,  showingthe effect of the proposed Military terms of an armistice with Germany.The Prime Minister said that the map showed that considerable portions of the iron and coal areas would,under the proposed military terms of an armistice, come within the neutral zone, which meant that Germany could notresume hostilities.     Part of the coal area was near Cologne, -and was an easy mark for our airmen. AThe Director of Military Operationsundertook to prepare a large scalemap indicating the localities of theprincipal industries of Germany,

(3)    The First I.ord of the Admiralty read a precis ofan appeal (of which he undertook to circulate completecopies) (Appendix I) from the-German Government to theGerman people, portions of. which had appeared in theEnglish newspapers that morning.The Prime Minister called attention to certain sent-fences in this appeal,, which clearly indicated the seriousinternal situation in Germany.     Read in the light of other information which had recently been received, it involved,in his view, some alteration in the instructions which, hadbeen given to the delegates left behind in Versailles, whowere proceeding to Paris to discuss with the President ofthe French Republic end Colonel House, amon&amp; others, tech- &apos;nieal details in the Havel tanas of an armistice withGermany.   He had received that morning from the assistant secretary of State for Foreign Affairs a copy of a. Paper ,from the Counsellor of the French Embassy, suggesting that,in Clause 23 of the &quot;Haval conditions of the armistice, thewords &quot;disarmed and thereafter&apos; interned in neutral ports to .be designated by the Allies&quot; should read &quot;disanaod. and thereafter interned in neutral or. Allied ports&quot;.   He thought this was a very important alteration, and practically amount*ed to a demand for complete surrender, and hd suggested tothe Imperial War Cabinet that our Naval delegate, who ms atpresent only authorised to discuss rntmr technical points,should now be given full powers of &apos; discussion-&quot;with M.Clemeneeau and Colonel House.The Seeretary of State for Foreign Affairs said thathe did not quite agree with the Prime Minister&apos;s Interprets-tion of this suggestion.   He thought that U* Clejaeneeau &apos;was mainly concerned from the point of view of International La^As regards the question of interning c-mmy ships either in neutral or Allied ports, he sited the ease where&apos;, in 1807,we had taken the Banish fleet into our own ports,.

The &quot;Hot efurther said that the President was in agreement with theEntente Governments in regard to compensation, and that marshall tech had been authorised hy the United States ofAmerica And the -Allied Governments to receive properlyaccredited representatives of the German Government and to-communicate to them the tense of an Armistice.The IrTiae Minister thought that this &quot;indicated thatthe President was disposed to question our position inregard to &quot; Freedom of the Seas&quot;.

It seemed clear to him that the Peace Tomshad been practically settled; . that was to say, that we ae-eepted President Wilson&apos;&amp; Fourteen Points, subject inly to(The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he thoughtit possible that the President agreed with the qualificationregarding compensation, and might he prepared to accept ourstandpoint in respect of the &quot;Freedom of the Seas&quot;.The Imperial War Cabinet decided(a)   to approve l*ord Ho cert Cecil1s proposedalteration:(h)   In view of the altered circumstances which had that morning been communicatedto them, to give full latitude ofdiscussion to our Haval delegate inParis.Qf q t a t this BA8 B8MT      (a)   The Secretary/for Foreign Affairs briefly describedFRONT.what had occurred at Versailles at the close of thelatest Session of the Supreme far Council, after the PrimeMinister&apos;s departure.    :,The question of the $astern front had been discussed, and our proposals -* that we should endeavour to supply arms to the elements in Russia which were favourable to the Entente cause, vjj. the Baltic, Bantssig andthe Vistula      had eventually been accepted in principle,but it appeared likely that we would have te act alone.M, Clemenceau had been af r&amp;id that any arms we might sendwould gat into the hands of the Bolsheviks, and had pointedout that it would net be possible for as to select the localauthorities who would be -responsible for the distributionof these arras.the Imperial far Cabinet decided that.

He raised no object-ion whatever to the Prime .A&amp;nister having gone to $ranee andarranged terras of an armistice without waiting for consultationwith the Dominions but, in addition to the armistice terms itwas quite clear that the Senas of Peace had also been definite-ly settleda     fl&apos;o this he took grave exception.     He felt very strongly that he and the other Dominion representatives shouldhave been consulted.     they had not been consulted, theirviews had not been asked jfoy.     In passing&apos; he might point outthat the words inserted in the second qualification toprovide for reparation did not cover the ground..2fhe I rime Ainleter pointed out that there was nothing in the - Presidents fourteen Points, subject to the qualifi-cations that we&apos;had introduced, which would prevent our.getting all the^ terms which the various Allies had put for-wsrd*   He had boon represented as saying that - Germany could have pesos whenever she liked on the fourteen Points.   Hehad never said this.   What he had said in July last wasthat Germany could have pease on the four main points -raisedby President Wilson, tthlch were exceedingly comprehensive.-Mr. Hughes said that his contention was that theacceptance of the President *8 Fourteen Points, subject to thetwo qualifications introduced by the British Government,would i-apoee groat limitations upon the Allies when theyassembled at the Peace Conference.     Ahe Peace conference would he bound by the Fourteen Points ?nd could neitherthornadd nor-take away.from/     He thoaght.it most unfortunate that the Peace Terms should have been settled without theDominions having been consulted.    She Dominions had notbeen represented at the meetings at Versailles, nor had they been- asked to express their views, WVRfe,     He- saidthat, speaking with all deference, he took groat exception to this.     wo doubt events had advanced very quickly, but

I    &apos; 207but he himself had been on the spot for several months, and SirEobert Borden could have come over in a few days.     He thoughtthat apart from thoir clear rights in this matter it would havebeen a gracious act if he and other Dominion Prime ministers had been consulted in regard to the terms of peace.     It wasonly Just to the Dominions, who had made such tremendous efforts and sacrifices in the War, that they should have been so eon-suited.     2?hat they had not been consulted was a breach of the plain declaration that had been made to them, that when the-Sierras of leace cams to be settled, they would have aa opportua-Ity of expressing their views.  -He maintained that,, in point of .fact, the lease Conference had already been held, in that the terras of Peace were decided -at the same time as the conditionscf armistices,     The British Government had declared war without consulting the Dominions,, aad now they were settling Peace Senasequally without referring to them.     $hey had notified the -Dominions that they were at war and&apos; now in like fashion they hadinfo rated the Dominions of the forms of Peace.     He confessed he did not understand precisely what the functions of the imperial war Cablast were supposed to be.     Certainly Its functions werenot executive, and they could hardly be called consultative for atthe last three meetings. Dominion representatives had merelybeen Informed of what were accomplished facts, without havingbeen given an opportunity of expressing their opinion beforehand.It appeared to him that the meetings of tho Imperial War cabinet had recently become merely meetings of the War Cabinet whenoverseas delegates were informed of a. fait aeooarali.   Ho wishedto eater a strong protest against this procedure.     Mr. Hughesthen&apos; proceeded to Indicate what, In his view, wore, the unsatis-faetory points in the Peace Serms.     AS regards the questionof the Freedom of the i*eas,fc2ae Govorasseat was to be congratulatedin every sense of tho to ma on the stand It had taken oa thisvitally important matter.la respect of Clause. 3 of President Wilson*.s Peace  onus, -&quot;She removal, as far as possible, of all economic barriersw -

he-regarded this as most dangerous: it affected the dominions in. common with all the Allies so far as thoir rights of self-government were concerned: it affected their, rights to makecommercial treaties; and it shut the door on differential tariffs and, perhaps, even on preferential trade within the iSsrpircuProbably, however, this last matter was outside its so ope *Farther, it precluded the possibility, after the War, of tariffdifferentiation between, say, Germany aad France*     He wishedto say at once, on behalf of iiuetralia, that that country would continue to consider itself at liberty to snake such tariffs asit thought fit.Again, at Versailles reference had been made to the nations which wore to be admitted to the leaoe Conference, and if had been decided that those should be admitted which had made very considerable sacrifices^.2Jhe Prime Minister pointed out that the point on that  &quot;occasion was whether such minor nations as Guatemala, Brassil,Nicaragua, ete*, should be invited,Mr* Hughes said that Mr. :0.0yd George had himself insistedupon Japan being admitted to the Conference because they wore a&quot;very sensitive people,&quot;    Japan could certainly not claimadmission oh the ground of having made great sacrifices inthis war*     fhe number of Australian dead was -actually greaterthan the array Japan had in the field In Siberia where she waslooking after her own interests,.    He would remind his colleagues that the Australians were also a. very sensitive people, and,further, that throughout Australia,. Japan was regarded as a daily menace.     Why should   Japan be included and Australiaexcluded from&apos;the Aeaoe Conference f   What sacrifices had Japanmade which were - in any way comparable with those of Australia fBid anyone dispute that, Aad the tide turned against us in thecourse of the War, we oould have been certain of japan&apos;s continuedadhesion ?   tariff cjuestions In Australia had been hung up duringthe War, but Australia meant to reserve to herself completeliberty after the War to deal/W    *^    *&quot;*

with t&amp;ffiffs as she thought  It, and she weald only yield on thismatter to forne raa;feure.&apos;   Further, la regard to tfce distributionof raw material, not only Australia and the other Dominions, butGreat &quot;Britain also, were closely affected,    &quot;$hie distribution, he understood, it was proposed should be regulated by the League of -Nations&apos; and was covered by the provisions of&apos; Clause 1X1*UiUHUOilBS, proceeding, said that under Clause % of the- resident*s Points, it would be impossible for Belgium and Prance,and the British iisapire, to get the reparation to which they were entitled,&apos;    la occupied Belgium sad franco, factories had been level-led to the ground, while Os3?saaay&apos;s factories were etl.ll intact.After the War, raw materials would naturally go to places wherefactories existed, asfi this would mean that the Cformaas would steala osareH upon Prance and Belgium, waoce loss would be irretrievable.In his view it would be a farce and a barren victory if, afternnying that wo had drawn the sword to free Belgium, wo Merely handed to Gorra&amp;ay a weapon which would&apos; reader 3olgium powerless beyond nopeof repair.    Shea, as regards shipping, we had lost millions, of tonsof shipping.    SJhat point slight be covered by the President&apos;aconditions, but ho suggested that reparation should be reparation in kind.  . If this were act possible, some handicap must be imposed on -Germany la regard to row materials and this was most certainly limited by Clause XIX.    Altogether he felt that Clause 3 was most urns at is--factory..Various laterpretatleas had boss placed upon the Presidentsfourteen Points.      as there anybody competent to say which interpretRation me the correct onot    $0 come now to the League of nations,he was surprised that J r*Aloyd Seorge and, at one of the Conferences,,sals soso thing which might be tweisted into meaning that, if a Leagueof Hatleas was established oa -a basis which seemed to him satisfactoryhe vould be prepared to concede the Freedom of the Seas.    Mr.Hughessaid that he wab sorry that the British Government was now apparentlycommitted to \\ League of nations.    fraal&amp;y, ho was all against sack

 a League as was apparently in President&apos;s mind. He could not commit himself to something so nebulous and which might be fraught with danger to the Empire. It it was a pious aspiration and nothing more, he was in favour of it; but if it was to control the British Empire to govern and defend itself as it thought best, he was absolutely opposed to it. He had seen somewhere a reference to a consultation which had been held in regard to the future distribution of the world&apos;s supplies of wool. He hoped that he might be supplied with the notes of that consultation, and of the letter which he understood had been sent to the President on the matter.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that the notes would be found in one of the proces-verbaux which had been distributed to the Cabinet.

MR. HUGHES said that we could not consent to allow the League of Nations to decide how raw material was to be distributed. The component parts of the British Empire must continue to buy and to procure it and to send it whence and where they liked. Our business was to re-establish France and Belgium in the position they held before the War, and we could not do this unless we denied wool to Germany for the period during which Belgium and France were in process of reconstruction. Next, as regards Clause 5, which referred to the German Colonies. His Majesty&apos;s Government had announced that in no circumstances would these colonies go back to Germany, but the Dominions expected that they would be incorporated in the British Empire, or be handed over the Dominions which had conquered them. In conclusion, Mr. Hughes again said that he regretted very much that Dominion representatives had only been called in, not to be consulted, but to be informed of decisions which had been taken.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that he thought he had made it quite clear to Mr. Hughes on the previous day what were the views of H.M. Government in regard to the disposal of the German Colonies. It was evident that there were very serious misunderstandings, 

 and, in order to clear these up, complete frankness was essential. Mr. Hughes&apos; misgivings had, in point of fact, no foundation, as he was quite sure Mr. Hughes, with his usual courage, would be ready to admit when he had heard his explanation. It was absolutely wrong to say that peace questions had not been discussed with the Dominion representatives. Those questions had been discussed at Sessions of the Imperial War Cabinet this year and last, and they had, moreover, been fully examined by two Special Committees of the Imperial War Cabinet the previous year. When all the Dominions were represented except Australia. The fact that Australia had not been represented was not the fault of His Majesty&apos;s Government. He had himself begged Mr. Hughes, early in 1917, to send a representative to the Imperial War Cabinet. As a matter of fact, the former Prime Minister of Australia was in this country at the time. It was not for us to suggest who should represent Australia, but it was on record that more than one appeal had been made to Australia that she should nominate someone to represent her. While the Imperial War Cabinet was sitting, telegrams briefly recording the progress of the discussions had been sent daily to Australia, and at the end of the Session a complete set of the Minutes and other documents had been sent to Mr. Hughes, who had never lodged a single protest against any decision which had been reached. The efforts and sacrifices made by the Dominions were fully recognised by them all, as was the fact that they were entitled to have a voice in the forthcoming Peace Conference. Mr. Lloyd George said that he himself had clearly told Colonel House, in France, what our attitude would be in regard to the disposal of the German colonies. As he had already pointed out, Peace questions had been discussed at the Second Session, held this year, of the Imperial War Cabinet, when Australia was represented by Mr. Hughes.



Mr. Hughes had complained that he did not yet know what our peace Terms were.    In regard to this the prime Ministerwished to say that, in Decembers, 1918,, president Wilson had asked-what were the peace Aims of the Allies.   This was just after the.present War Cabinet bad been formed and whenthe United States of America were an the verge of cominginto the War.   An Allied Conference had immediately beenassembled in London and the Peace Aiias had been formulated,peace Terms had thus been discussed at three great Oenfer-ences;    the Allied Conference in January, 1917, and theFirst and Second Sessions &apos;of the Supreme War Council *Mr. Hughes said that he was net here-last year, buteverything had been discussed again this year:    thereforewhatever was done last year was covered by this year&apos;adiscussions.The Prime Ministers proceeding,  said that nothingthat had been decided at Versailles in-any way committedus to anything which was contrary to what had been agreedupon at those three Conferences.    Thus,  in the course ofthe last week or so,  directly he had seen there was a pros-pect of an early peace, he had telegraphed to every dominion prime Minister to be ready to come to England at once.Mr. Hassey and General Botha had both said that they would prefer to come,  in order possibly to save a double journey,directly the armistice &quot;with Germany hod been signed.    sir robert Borden- was much more accessible than either GeneralBotha or Mr. Massey,  and he had accordingly been asked tocome to England at once,  and he was starting 1 (mediately.Directly the British delegates to the last Session of theSupreme War Council had returned to England, he had wishedto summon a meeting of the Imperial War Cabinet in order&apos; toinform members of what had taken place at Versailles,   unfor-unfortunately, Mr. Hughes was not available,  as he had gone toYork.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that ok tworecent occasions when,  in the prime Minister&apos;3 absence, hehad been taking the Chair at. Meetings of the War Cabinet,fee had summoned Mr. Hughes by telephone to 10 Downing Street,he had found that he fad not. available.The prime Minister, proceeding,  said that hi a instruc-tions to his own Ministry Were to held themselves availableto attend Meetings of the Cabinet at a moment&apos;s notice,  as,in time of war, it might be necessary to take important decisions without an hour&apos;s delay.   It was impossible to defer Meetings of the War Cabinet or Imperial War Cabinet inorder to suit the convenience of individual Ministers.   Thou-sands of valuable lives might be sacrificed because a decision could not be taken owing to - the absence of a particularMinister.   Mr. Lloyd George said he felt bound to make thisrepresentation in order&apos;to acquit himself of the charge ofany personal discourtesy te Mr. Hughes, and also of discour-teay to the great country which he represented and whichhad done so magnificently in the War.   He himself had to bein readiness to proceed to France at any hour,  and momentousdecisions could not be postponed because a particularMinister was absent from London.    The only point before theImperial&apos; War Cabinet now was not the Terras of Peace, butthe question whether our commitments at Versailles precludedthe Dominions from raising at the Peace Conference anyquestion upon which the Imperial -War Cabinet had arrived ata decision with Mr. Hughes&apos; concurrence.   He wished to say atonce that -there was nothing which had been decided at theSupreme War Council which ruled out what had been agreedupon at the Meetings of the Imperial War Cabinet.   The two main points raised by Mr. Hughes were, first,  the questionof reparation.   He sort of reparation had been ruled out bythe recent decisions -at Versailles,    A, war indemnity had been-ruled out because, beyond full reparation, Germany wouldhave no means of paying further.   The re was. nothing fco prevent

either France, Belgium or*Great Britain asking for fullreparation for all damage done, s.g., in our own casereparation for every ship sunk by the eneiay,  either in cashor in kind.   The total reparation tsfoich might be claimedwould amount to something between a thousand and two thousandmillion pounds.   Germany could certainly not pay in gold,and the only way in which she could pay would be by hermanufacture a fl for which she would, of course, require rawmaterial:.    As regards raw materials Mr. Balfour and he had,   -at Versailles, anticipated every ene of Mr. Hughes&apos; points.The question had. been raised by the Belgian Representative,who had received their immediate support, and they had infact used arguments identical with those employed by Mi&apos;.Hughes himself.    Colonel House, who was president &apos;Wilsen*sinterpreter, had expressed his concurrence in their views,and had at once telegraphed to the president in order tomake sure that he,  too, agreed with those views.   The question had also been raised at a special meeting which was attended by prime -Ministers only, which M. Clemenoeau had expressed his concurrence with the Belgian Minister.    It had beenagreed that Germany was not to get, during the period of reconstruction,  the same treatment as Allied and co-belligerentnations.   We should - go to the Conference on the clear under-standing that Germany would not be put on the same terms withother nations until all were in a position to start fair.Mr. Hughes said that that cleared up the point.The prime Minister continued that, in regard totariffs, president Wilson had himself explained what he meantin the challenge he had recently issued to the RepublicanParty.Mr. Hughes said that the President&apos;s challenge related-to tarriffs generally, and not to the power to give preferen-ti al tre atment.

fhe -Prise Minister said that the  resident fully       fcXt)understood that preferential treatment as between the Uomin-ious, India and Great Britain, was a purely deadest lo ques-tiOn * -Mr. Hughes said that Japan was a neighbour of, and acommercial competitor with, Australia, which country&apos; shewas flooding&apos; with cheap good-Bo   Shis dangerous&apos;- competition-rnuat be met by some form of tariff.She Prime Minister said that if Mr * Hughes proposed toset up, say, a tariff of SO per cent, against Japan, as corn-pared with 10 per cent, against.another country., he certain-ly thought that such a procedure would hot be compatible with &apos; the - President1 a awn l nt er pr ot at 1 on of &quot;his Clause 8*She Chancellor of the JSxehequer said that he himself had at first been apprehensive of Clause 3, as it was tothe advantage of the French and ourselves not to be tied&apos; bysny favoured-nations clause.   they had discussed the matterfully with the French representative??, and they had all agreed that the terms of Clause 3 were se vague that wecould really - place any interpretation upon them that weliked.   In regard to preferential treatment, the Americantreatment was &quot;special treatment for special treatment&quot;.He thought it was a reasonable Interpretation of Clause 3to say that goods could not be allowed to enter, without any restriction, Australia, where wages ware high, from oeun-trles where low vrages prevailed.-Mr Hughes said that if this could be done under clause 3, - Clause 3 was only worth what it -was-- ,three lines of print.She Prime /Minister said that. In his view, the onlyClause of.the Fourteen Points which could not be mle-inter-preted was that which related to the Jfreedom of the Seas, aHence the strong- protest that he and his colleagues had madeto this- Clause at Versailles.   As regards the question ofthe Dominion Keproaontatives at tho Peace Conference, two

 alternative suggestions had been made: (a) that all the Dominions should be represented by one selected Minister, and (b) that each Dominion should be entitled to have one Representative present when any question was discussed which affected that particular Dominion. He had urged very strongly upon M. Clemenceau and Colonel House that the Dominions were entitled to such representation at the Peace Conference.

Mr Hughes said that, at the Imperial War Cabinet, there was a clear understanding that Representatives of the Dominions should be present at the Peace Conference. He felt bound to say the he still felt our hands were very much tied by the President&apos;s Fourteen Points.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer repeated that he himself had regarded Clause 3 as the most dangerous of the President&apos;s Points. However, it obviously affected France and Belgium much more than ourselves, and if they were satisfied that its terms were so vague that they felt their hands were not tied by it, he did not think that we need worry.

Mr. Hughes said that he regretted most profoundly that he had been given no opportunity of expressing the opinion of Australia upon President Wilson&apos;s Fourteen Points.
