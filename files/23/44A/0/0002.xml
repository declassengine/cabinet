He had always been told that the War couldnot be won In the air, but he was not quite satisfied in regardto this.   He asked why there should not be a very great develop-ment of this Service which would, in fact, produce greater resultsthan the costly and exhausting offensives such as that carried onin Elanders last year9

A 8LORD MILKER and GENERAL SMUTS explained that very great develop-ments were taking place in the Air Service.    There were, however,considerable limitations on the extent of the development and useof these/craft.   For example, the spaoe covered by aerodromes whichhad to be levelled and prepared, involving a very large amountof labour, the large numbers/of mechanics, transport, and other forms of man-power required to maintain aircraft in the field.; the limitations o4 weather, aircraft oould not operate effectively atlong distances in snow, rain, mist, clouds, or high winds^/limit-ations as to the marksmanship of aerodromes.   In the course of the conversation it was pointed out that the &quot;(Joeben&quot; had been bombedsomething like 48 times in  4 hours, when she was resting on a sand-bank, and yet the enemy had been able to get her off.   attention was also drawn to the frequent bombing of Zeebrugge, Bruges, andOstend, which had never prevented these ports from being used asbases by torpedo craft and submarines,   It was suggested that Mr,Hughes should raise these questions at the Meeting of the imperial war Cabinet to be held in the near future at the Air Ministry.MR HUGHES asked whether sufficient use had been made of^scientif-io resources of the British Empire?   In particular he asked whether-er there were any scientists engaged generally as apart from those engaged in particular technical aspects?   In reply, he was informedthat the whole of the scientific resources of the country and ofthe Empire had been mobilised in a remarkable degree; for example,the Admiralty Board of Invention and Research had employed an enow-mous amount of scientific energy to the development of anti-sub-marine apparatus; the same applied to aircraft, and to many branch-es of munitions work, including a great mobilisation of the chemic*al resources of the country for the production of poison gases, nor was the mobilisation of our scientific resources limited to the de-velopment of weapons of war.   Much work had also been done in industry, especially in those matters where we had been dependbaSfon enemy sources of supply, such as optical glass and dye-stuffs.SCIENTIFIC DEVELOPMENTS *MS

1?ME LLOYD GEOEGE said that probably this was one of the bestfeatures of our war organisations.SHE FAILTJEE Off TEE Yth ARMY.There was then a discussion as to the reasons of the failureof the Yth Army on and after Maroh El.MR HUGHES asked what General Gough*s explanation was of his de-feat?load MILKER said that General Goughrs explanation practicallywas that he was attacked 3 to 1, and some of his divisions broke,necessitating the retirement of the rest.    The causes of this defeatwere numerous and complex,   it was partly due to the lack of re-serves, and this in turn was due to the absence of proper unity ofooramand.   Another contributing cause was the inexperienoe of of-fioers, particularly of regimental officers, in open warfare, whichhad resulted in many strong and valuable positions being given up without proper cause.In reply to Mr. Hughes MR LLOYD GEOEGE said that General Goughhad been deprived of his command, but at the present time no fur-ther action was contemplated in regard to him.    He himself did not wish to deny that the affair of March El had been badly managed.In reply to Sir Robert Borden MR LLOYD GEORGE said that he did.not believe that the disaster had been due to lack of adequate de-fences.   There had been plenty of trenches and plenty of barbed wire on most of the line, although it was true that a portion ofthe line which had been taken over from the French a few weeks be-fore the battle was not so well defended as the remainder,   so faras he could gather the real cause was that the rear trenches had notbeen manned, as there had not been enough men available to man them.It was perfectly useless to put up sign-posts pointing the way forthe retiring men to the trenches, and it was probably useless toput Officers or Eon-commissioned Officers to direct the men intothe trenches.   What was required was a body of troops, even troopscouldof inferior quality, who jfasst actually man the trenches to cover the retirement of other troops, who could then rally behind them, and he3o

-understood that this had boon done*RUSSIA.MR MASSEY asked whether, when it was contemplated that a oar-tain number of allied troops should accompany the Japanese Army,if it intervened in Siberia, this would involve weakening theWestern front?MR LLOYD GEORGE replied in the negative.   He pointed out thatit was only proposed to send a nucleus force to give the appearance of Allied interventions and this would be taken from such troops as the garrison at Hong Kong or troops in north China.In reply to Mr. Hughes, MR LLOYD GEORGE said that president Wil-son had not as yet agreed to intervention.MR LLOYD george INTERVEMEQlf WITH M. KEREN SKI.MR LLOYD GEORGE said that on that afternoon he had had an inter-view of an hour and three-quarters with M. Kerenski.   Mr. PhilipKerr had also been present, and was preparing a note of the conver-sation.   He had found M. Kerenski a much more effective person than he had anticipated.   He had been very much to the point during thewhole conversation, and had not wasted a word.   He regarded M.Trotski as Germanophil, while M. Lenin, he considered, lived in thecloudso   Mo Kerenski had said that Russia was now ripe to take uparms again agsinst Germany.   There had been quite a r&amp;au^Laissancethere; the Russian people were at last beginning to understand themeaning of the Brest Litovsk Treaty.   The Ukraine had got its fillof Germans, and its population had conceived a great hatred for thenuA partisan war had broken out there, and the Germans were in con-slderable diff ioulties.   M. Kerenski had wanted to know what weiwere prepared to do, and MR LLOYD GEORGE had wanted to know whatthe Russians were prepared to do, and on this subject they had had some fencing.   They had then got on to the topic of japan.   M* Ker-enski had been talking of intervention, and MR LLOYD GEORGE asked him what he meant by intervention? and had pointed out the difficultyof our intervening with a Government that did not want us.   M.Kerenski had then used the word &quot;support&quot;, and when asked what he4.

meant had said &quot;military support.&quot;   At this point the question of japan was raised, and M. Kerenski   had said that the acceptance of japanese intervention depended entirely 6n the way in which it was presented to the Russian public.   If we said that Japanese inter-vention was merely part of a plan of all the Allies to help Russia,they would not quarrel as to the percentage of Japanese troops. Onthis point he had been quite businesslike.   He had expressed a de-sire to see Lord Milner.LORD MILEfER expressed his readiness to see M. Kerenski.MR HUGHES asked what evidence Mr. Lloyd George had obtained asto the support that M. Kerenski had in Russia?MR LLOYD GEORGE said that M. Kerenski had said that he represented the Executive Committee of the Constituent Assembly, who comprised social Revolutionaries, Sooisl Democrats, and some party whom he had alluded to as Popular Democrats.   In addition, he repres-ented the Cadets.    He had claimed that these Parties represented the bulk of the Russian people.   Before he left Russia we had had a communication from M. Lockhart rather to the same effeot.M* Kerenski had eseaped as a Serbian Officer.   He said that themilitary power of the Bolshevists was a pure sham.   They talkedof military conscription, but this was a sham; they governed bymeans of an efficient Police Force, but the moment any seriousmilitary force came up against it, such as the Czeoho-Slovaks*the Police were powerless.   M. Kerenski had said that the workmenwere getting very sick of the Bolshevists, and he had quoted theresolutions of Workmen&apos;s Committees and of Social Revolutionariespractically demanding the reoonstitution of the Alliance.   the bolshevists were stronger in Moscow than anywhere else.MR LLOYD GEORGE had asked M. Kerenski as to whether the russians had any attachment to their country.   He had asked whether they felt like the French,and when a Russian village was lost they felt as though their finger had been out?   This had rather appeared tostagger M. Kerensky for the moment.   He had said that they realis-ed that they were being out off from the sea and could not exist5.

as a country.   When asked whether the common people felt like that he had declared that they did.SIR ROBERT BORDEE pointed out that in one respect M. Kerenski*sinformation was corroborated &quot;by recent Foreign Office telegrams which indicated that the Bolshevists were failing.MR LLOYD GEORGE said that M. Eerenski had given him the impres-sion of being honest and in earnest.   He thought he was probably a Jew, though most likely he would not admit to this.MR HUGHES pointed out the desirability of getting corroborativeevidence in regard to MXo Kerenski1s bona fides.MR MASSEY said thajb there had been two Englishmen on board theship which brought  STfrom the United States both of whom knewRussia from A. to Z.   One was a Mr. Thornton, and the other hadbeen his foDgaan.   They had both oome straight from Moscow throughSiberia.SIR ROBERT BORDEE pointed out that the information the PrimeMinister had obtained from M. Kerenski merely left us where wewere before, namely, that we ought to have allied interventionand not Japanese intervention.MR HUGHES suggested that M. Kerenski*s eorroboration of this might go far to satisfy President Wilson.MR LLOYD GEORGE said that M. Kerenski had wished to see M.Clemenoeau and this raised the question of the next Meeting of theSupreme War Council,THE HEXT MEETIEG Off THE SUPREME WAR OOUEOIL.MR LLOYD GEORGE proposed that the Imperial War Cabinet should adjourn for the whole of next week, first in order to enable lord milner and himself to attend the next meeting of the Supreme WarOouncil at Versailles, and second in order to enable the primeMinisters of the Dominions to visit their troops in France.   Hesuggested that the Prime Ministers should endeavour to come toVersailles on Wednesday or Thursday next week, in order to get anopportunity of meeting M. Clemenoeau and General Fooh, to which he

attached some importance.The Prime Ministers undertook to consider thisproposal before tomorrow.The Secretary was instructed to arrange that thenext Meeting of the Supreme War Council shouldbe held on Tuesday, July 2, and not on Monday,July 1, as proposed by M. Clemenoeau.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.SJune 24, 1918. -
