THE WESTERNPRONT.AMERICANDIVISIONSIN FRANCE.(1) The Chief of the Imperial General staff reported.      /that Rupprecht still had 21 divisions in reserve.    TheDirector of Military Intelligence had now identified 12of Rupprecht1s divisions with the Crown Prince1s Army.A total of 37 German divisions has now been withdrawnin the present battle to be re-fitted.(2) The Chief of the imperial General staff said that,so far as he could ascertain,the position as regardsAmerican divisions was as followsj- 6 divisions havebeen withdrawn from the present battle for re-fitting,2 are still engaged in the battle, 5 are in quiet partsof the French line, 5 are with the British Army, 2 arefresh in reserve, 8 or 9 are still in training, makinga total of 28 or 29 divisions.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff had receivedsome information to the effect that the casualties in 7American divisions in the recent battle were about 25,000.FIXTURE MI1-ITARY 0P-considerations.(3)   With reference to imperial War Cabinet 27 B. Minute3 (v), the Chief of the Imperial General staff read atelegram from General Du Cane, dated 3rd of August, tothe effect that, in the present situation, it was diffi-cult to say exactly what General FochIs forthcoming oper-ations would be.    The Germans were, however, withdrawingin several places, and General pochrs intention was topress the enemy.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that,so far as he knew, General Foch did not intend to under-n take any considerable^ op era 1^ one.   In reply to a question/he said, his own belief was that the Germans&quot; were at pres-ent seeking, as far as possible, to place ^ rivergbetweentheir lines and ours in order to avoid raids by our Tanks.

lERSIA. , f4) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that hehad received some information tending to show that theTurks were working down towards Kasvin and Hamadan.   we did not know how much rolling-stock they had on their rail-ways, and the problem of how they were to approach these places was not yet fully worked out.   As regards counter-measures on our part, these were largely a question oftransport.   We- had ample troops in Mesopotamia, providedwe could get them Into Persia and maintain them there,particularly in winter. ,HE CAUCASUS.    (5) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported thatBaku appeared to be in Turkish hands, in whioh case Colon-el Bicharakoff had probably gone north.    It would be useful if Colonel Bicharakoff could -^$msiz. to Astrakhan with a viewto a seizure of the shipping on the Volga,    otherwise, hewould not assist us much by going north.fctESICAH CO-      (6) The Prime Minister drew attention to Foreign Office&quot; RATION.telegrams from himself to Monsieur Clemenceau, dated Aug-pining ofpiarican. ust 2, and replies sent through lord Derby (Nos. 939 andpoops behindhe British. 942), on the subject of the training of American troops be-line.hind the British lines and the use of British shipping forle Shipmentf American    the conveyance of American troops,coops.In regard to the former question, Monsieur Clemenceaufoposed Meet-lg of Supremeappeare(i to indicate that he was favourable to the training.r Council.of further American divisions behind the British lines.The future would show whether he was really willing to es-ercise pressure on General Foch in this respect.In regard to the shipping question, Monsieur Clemenoeau-. v: -./:v .        . &apos; &apos;&apos;&apos;   I-.&apos;-:-&apos;- &apos;---:*&apos; ;   -: y &apos; -       -: &apos; - -p -had asked that the Minister of shipping might be sent to

HiParis.    This meant that he intended to repeat what M.Tardieu had tried to do at Versailles when he endeavoured tocreate the impression that the shipment of American troopswas a matter to, he settled between the Prench and american governments.   In the Prime Minister1s opinion, however, itwas very important that any shipping negotiations shouldbe conducted In London, where all information was available,particularly as the British Government were supplying thelargest share of the shipping.   The question also aroseas to whether we ought to to undertake to make even greatersacrifices than we had already made to provide shipping,unless the Americans were prepared to take over a portionof the British line.    If they would not do this, we should find that, while the Prench soldiers were getting regularno leave,leave, our own troops were receiving/no rest, and  nsuffi-cient training.    In this connection the Prime Minister re-minded his colleagues that the British section of the line was, on the whole, the most difficult to hold. Consequently,if his colleagues approved, the Prime Minister proposed to reply to M. Clemenceau that all shipping information was available in London, and that any negotiations in regardto shipping should be conducted there.The Prime Minister pointed out that the original pro-gramme for the American troops had been one of 100 divisionsby July next,   How this had been lowered to a programme of80 divisions, and President Wilson stated that this couldonly be achieved if the British Government could give fur-ther assistance In cargo steamers.   I, Clemenceau had ig-nored^this in his telegram.    He himself rather inclined tothe view that we ought to make a special effort to revert to the programme of 100 divisions.    In his opinion the wholequestion ought to be considered by-the Supreme War Counpil,and if his colleagues approved he proposed to suggest to

suggest to M. Olemenoeau and M. Orlando that a Meeting ofthe Supreme War Council should he held in London any time after the end of this week, which would suit M. Clemencear..Lord Milner concurred in the proposal that the supreme war Council should he invited to consider the question,hut expressed doubts as to whether it would he possible toreach the original programme of 100 American divisions. Hewas inclined to think that the difficulties of supplyingsuch large numbers were too great.. If, however, the Amer-icans could be induced &quot;to adopt the scheme proposed by Gen-eral Sackville West for limiting the American Army to 50or 60 divisions, and putting the balance of their forcesin British and Prench divisions, the American effort mightbe equivalent to one of 100 divisions.    In this connection the Prime Minister said that it would be necessary first to induce General Foch to abandon the idea he had that theBritish had ample reserves of troops for the maintenanceof 59 divisions,    unless he were convinced of the truth efthis question he would not lend us any support for the in-corporation of American troops.The Prime Minister1s Committee agreed that:-Mr0 Lloyd George should send a personal telegram to Mo Clemenceau in the sense he proposed asregards both the conduct of negotiations onthe subject of the shipment of American troops and the proposed Meeting of the Supreme War.Council.(7) Allusion was made to a Report by Lieutenant-ColonelRoure of the Prench Army on British man-power which had been circulated to the prime Ministers (G.I.5277)*It was generally agreed that Colonel Houre*s report was a somewhat insolent document, not only in respect tomany of the statements made, but to Its patronising tone.Lord Milner stated, that the War Office were preparing a reply.

IcEE BRTJAYCOxiBiTKBS.-    113(8) The Chief of the Imperial General staff said-that attention ought to be directed to the question of re-opening the Bruay coal mines.    So far as he was aware therewas no military objection to their being worked again.They were no more under fire than they were before thebattles of this year.    Only within the last day or twothe Germans had retired somewhat behind the La BasseeOanal.   He did not know, as a matter of fact, whether the mines were being worked or notoTHE NA7AL (9) Attention was drawn to an Admiralty Memorandum enti-EEFORT 03?GREAT BRITAIN tied &quot;Naval Effort - Great Britain and the United StatesAND THE UNIT-ED STATES OE   of America&quot; (G.T.5307), in which it was pointed out that america.the united States, while making very great progress inmercantile shipbuilding, were contributing very much lessthan the British Admiralty to the construction of warships.In this connection Mr. Massey said that a prominent ship-ping man had informed him that the United states of Amer-ica were, in certain directions, continuing and developingLines of trade with a view to their post-war position.czecho-SLOT-AKS.Presentposi ti on.(10) The Ohief of the Imperial General Staff said thatthe situation at vladivostock was not very satisfactory.According to information he had just received from theJapanese Military Attache1, Japan was only mobilising one division and not two as had previously been believed.Moreover, only one Japanese brigade would be sent to Ylad-ivostock by August 12., The Canadian reinforcements couldnot arrive for some time.    In this connection Sir RobertBorsten said that General Mewburn wished to ^obtain the Can*adian force for vladivostock on voluntary lines, but thattheno time would be lost, and. that/Oanadians should arrivewell before the wintero   He felt that if the situation was critical it would have to be saved from forces muchnearer the scene of action.

IllIn reply to a question, General Wilson said that ri-fles were being sent from, the united states of America to vladivostock for the use of the Czecho-Slovak,    He fear-I -ed that the main difficulty would he to get them past theIstunnels in the neighbourhood of Lake Baikal, ?;hich were reported to hare been destroyed.   Attention was drawn toMr0 Lookharfs telegram Ho. 346, which seemed to indicatethat considerable Russian forces were rallying to the sideof the Czecho-Slovaks.    It was generally agreed that theprincipal weakness in the situation was the ,interpositionof a considerable block of Bolshevist forces, supportedby prisoners of war, between Lake Baikal and the region ofOhita,,    In dealing with this difficulty the Japanese wouldhave the advantage of operating by the Manchurian Railway,esident (11) Attention was drawn to President Wilson1 s proclarna-l8&apos;on* soclamation. tion on the subject of the Allied intervention in favourof the Ozecho-Slovaks,    The Proclamation came in for con-siderable criticism.    It was pointed out that it contain-ed an implication that the course suggested by the Allieswas one calculated to make use of rather than to assistRussia, and that the United States,was Russians only truefriend; also that the effect of the proclamation wouldbe to let the enemy know exactly the limitations of our action.in Siberia, and that the impression was conveyedthat America only was sending supplies and material assist-ance to Russia^   &amp;t the same time it was generally agreedthat no action could be taken which would tend to estrangethe United states of America or to promote controversy.The Prime Minister asked for the advice of his col-leagues as to whether he should take the opportunity ofhis statement in Parliament on the following day on the7o

adjournment to say something on the subject, and, if so,on what lines he should proceed.Lord liobert Cecil suggested that the Prime Minister&apos;^ should ignore what President Wilson had announced, and explain to Parliament exactly what our desires are, and what our policy still is.   Sxeekx He should explain thatour first object is to support the Czecho-slovaks, butthat, in order to assist them, it was necessary to restoresome sort of order - or, rather, as Mr. Balfour suggest-ed, to give the Russians a chance of restoring order -and to get rid of tyranny.    He should point out that Ger-many is setting out to destroy Russia as an economic com-petitor, and doing her utmost to make Russia dependent on her.   in Poland,Germany was destroying the means of pro-duction, particularly in.the manufacturing centre of Lodz,exactly as she had already done in Russia, her object be-ing to keep back Russia1s development as a possible rival.Mr. Balfour pointed out that Germany1s object was tomake Russia a producer of raw material under her own con-trol.    He agreed that Germany was doing her best to ruinPoland as a competitor, but he doubted if the same policy had been extended to Russia.   Apart from this he agreed with the general line suggested by Lord Bobert GeciloshePROPOSED (IE) Lord Robert Cecil submitted to the Committee ofpro clamatioh.Prime Ministers the draft of a Proclamation based on an earlier draft which had been circulated to Members of theImperial War Cabinet which he proposed should be published in viadiv^-stoek-in connection with the landing there.The Proclamation, as originally drafted, had been eircu-lated to our Allies with a view to its publication as ajoint Manifesto, but the powers concerned had preferred

ifa, Whitehall Gardens, S-Wo,August 6, 1918oto issue their own Proclamations.    The original drafthad been modified in consequence.The draft proclamation was criticised on the groundthat its promises were out of proportion to the modestsize of our intervention.   The Prime Ministers, however,considered on the whole that its publication would be ad-vantage ous.The prime Ministers decided that;-The Foreign Office should arrange for thepublication of the^Manifesto in Tladivpstook. CHANGED. (13) The Committee of Prime Ministers approved the fol-lowing communique in regard to the landing at Archangel;-&quot;Allied forces, naval and military, with the active concurrence of the Russian population,landed at Archangel on August End.   Their ar-rival was greeted with general enthusiasm bythe inhabitants.&quot;
