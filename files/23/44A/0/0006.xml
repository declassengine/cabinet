ITAJj- MR LLOYD GEORGE said, that since the morning he had hadFRONT.a long talk with Signor Nitti, the Italian Minister of Fin-ance, who. with the Prime Minister Signor Orlando, was per-haps the principal figure in the Italian Cabinet,,    SignorNitti had shown himself very apprehensive of another attack by the Austrians,   He had said that the Austrians had super-superseded their Generals by better men.   He thought that theywould avoid the mistakes they had made on the last occasion,particularly in regard to the dispersal of their troops overtoo wide a front.    They would concentrate their attackingdivisions on a much narrower front.   He had expressed theview that the Austrians now had 70 divisions against 51Italian, as well as 5.000 guns, which would enable them tomake all the necessary preparations for the artillery attackbefore the arrival of German divisions to stiffen them   he asked Lord Cavan what his information was on this point?LORD CAVAN said that he could not understand Signor Nitti*s figures, and he pointed out that the Italian Intelligence Le-partment were apt to give undue credence to unconfirmed re-ports.   Aocording to his information, which he had checked afew days ago just before leaving Italy, the Allied Force onthe Italian front, including the British, Frenoh, Czecho-Slovak, and 3 Cavalry divisions, amounted to 61, and not 51,while h% aid not believe the Austrians had *%tf$m 70**U*-fdivisions^.   There were no German divisions on the italian front.In reply to Mr. Hughes he said that the average size of theItalian divisions was about the same as that of the Austrian.The Italian divisions varied a good deal in strength, for ex-ample, the Ard-ite were rather stronger than the others, butthe average in the two opposing Armies was about the same*He was of opinion that if the Germans decided definitely that

they had failed in France, and determined to concentrate on italy, they oould knook the Italians out, unless arrangements were made to meet them.   Personally, he was of opinion that,if the Germans merely sent 6 divisions to Italy, as they had\ done in the attack of last autumn, the Allies should be ableto hold them.   He felt bound to mention, however, that General;Graziani, the Officer commanding the French oorps, did not/agree in this.    General Graziani had seen the Italians knook-; ed out of the Col del Rosso, on his right, during the recentattack, and had formed the conclusion that they were not goodtroops on the defensive and oould not stand heavy shelling.General Graziani consequently deduced that the sight of a pickelHaube would strike such terror into the Italians that they wouldnot stand.   Nevertheless, lord Cavan said that the Italiansjhad shown a good deal of grit in their powers of counter-fj - .i attack.   In further reply to Mr. Hughes he said that the Ger-mans could put 2 divisions on to the Italian front for 1 thatwe oould put in the same time.   For example, if the Germansput in 24, we could only put in IE in the same time, unlessthe railway communications over the Mont Cenis had been improved.SIR MAURICE BANKEY drew attention to joint Note 33 by thePermanent Military Representatives at Versailles, which he saidhad now been approved by all the Governments concerned, so thatin time we might hope for a material improvement of the com-munications between France and Italy.   A reserve stook of 150tOOOtons of ooal was now being sent from this country to Italy inconnection with this improvement.LORD CAVAN said that on his Journey he had observed workin progress on the Mont Cenis railway communications.GENERAL HARINGTON confirmed Lord Cavan1s view about therelative strength of the Italians and Austrians.    Our informa-tion, he said, did not in the least support the discrepancyof 20 divisions in favour of the Austrians, alleged by SignorNittia

GENERAL SMUTS pointed out that, when allowance was made forthe 8,000,000 of Ozecho-Slovaks, the population of the two na-tions was not very different.MR LLOYD GEORGE said that he had made this point with SignorNitti, who had replied, however, that soldiers are soldiers,and that when put in the line they would generally fight.LORD 0AVA1T, in reply to Mr. Hughes, said that, in the recentrighting, there had &quot;been no/Czecho-Slovak divisions fighting on the Austrian side, although there had been one fighting asa division on the Italian side.    On the Austrian side their troops had been mixed up with Hungarians and Austro-Germans.In reply to Mr. Lloyd George, he said that the Austrian ma-ohine-gunners had fought very well, but the infantry had foughtindifferently.    They had not known how to take advantage of a success that they had gained.   Moreover, when counter-attackedthey had shown great readiness to surrender, and the Britishcounter-attack across 1,500/of Ho Man*s Hand had obtained 700prisoners, 10 guns, and some machine-guns.    The Magyar troops had shown the peculiar characteristic that they would stand andbe killed rather than put their hands up to surrender.   He hadtalked to two out of the three Officers who had commanded thethree last raids before he left Italy, and they had told him that the Magyars would neither fight nor surrender, and therehad been nothing left to do but to kill^ them, which was anunpleasant business.   If a Magyar soldier was grounds. caught holdof and told he must come back as a prisoner, he would throwhimself on the ground and refuse to move.    This was probablyvdue to his having been told that he would be killed in any event.    The Austro-Germans and other races composing the Aus-trian Empire, on the other hand, were quite willing to marchback as prisoners.

MR LLOYD GEORGE said that Signor Kltti had made the sug-gestion that, with the addition of Tanks and grans and a fewdivisions, the Italians might achieve a considerable successon the offensive in the near future.LORD CAVAEF said he agreed with Signor iTItti on this point.He believed that with a strong offensive it might be possible,if not to reach Trent, at any rate to get very near it, andthe Austrians were very nervous about Trent, and in theirpresent condition of morale the effect on them would be veryserious.   Prior to the Austrian attack a scheme for an offen-sive had been prepared., and he thought that this scheme, sup-ported by Tanks, could be carried out mainly with Italian troops.Tanks had never been seen on the Italian front, and would prob-ably have a great effect.    He had talked with a BrigadierGeneral In the Tank Corps who bad accompanied General Sir henry wilson to Italy on his recent visit, and he had gathered from him that they could be employed at the bottom of the valleys,where they could makefvery important diversion from the mainattack, the lines of which he indicated.   He laid some stress on the importance of a main attack on the Asiago plateau.    Tbeobject of this would be to thicken tha Italian position in the mountains, which, at present, only ran a few kilometres fromthe edge of the plain, so that the Italian forces were alwaysliable to be pushed over the edge by a relatively small advanoeon the part of the enemy.    The Austrian morale was low, and theItalian morale was high, and the Allies ought to take advant-age of this fact to strengthen the position in the manner hehad suggested. - - -In reply to General Smuts, he said that his present orders were merely to strengthen his defences.   He believed that theItalians had lost 100,000 men in the recent Austrian offensive,but that the Austrians had lost 150,000.   He deduced this fromthe exact knowledge that he had of the enemy1s, casualties inhis own sector, and that of the French, which, on a conservative5o

estimate, was put at 6,000 killed and prisoners, although hewas confident that the real number was 7,500* which figureoould be doubled for wounded.* in support of the idea of an offensive, he said that the mere movement of troops to Italy would make the Austriansapprehensive and cause them to ask for German aid, which wouldbe embarrassing to the Germans when pressed on the Western\    front.1 .     -GENERAL HARINGTON said that he had read the report of theBrigadier General of the Tank Corps who had accompanied Gener-al Wilson, and he had said that if there was any idea ofcrossing the Piave and advancing beyond it, he thought the tanks would be very useful, but they would not be of any great value in the mountains.   We had offered the Italiansa certain number of Mark IV. Tanks, but he had just been read-ing the Minutes of the Tank Committee at Versailles and foundthat the Italian Representative had refused to have Mark IV.Tanks.   We had no Mark V. or Mark Vs. to spare, as we were re-equipping our own Tank Corps in France.   Moreover, general foch was pressing for 300.LORD CAVAN said that General HaringtonTs account of theBrigadier General&quot;s report did not quite tally with what hehad told him, but perhaps he had altered his view. He alsolaid stress on the importance of receiving notice if tanks were to be employed on the mountain fronts, as it would benecessary to strengthen the bridges leading to the valleysto carry them.GENERAL HAEKENGTON* in reply to questions by Mr. LloydGeorge, fully agreed with Lord Cavan that the Allies requiredmore depth on the Italian mountain front.   He agreed alsothat there was a chance of giving the Austrians a good hardknock when we had the troops, to spare, but with the presentsituation on the Western Sront, this was not the case.

LORD CAVANs in reply to General Smuts, said that the hesttime of year for an attack on the Italian front was from aboutthe 7th of September to the 15th of October.    At present itwas too hot.GENERAL SMUTS pointed out that the proper time would appearto be in the autumn when it was too late for a reaction onthe part of the Germans,    This, he pointed out, had been theGerman plan last year in their attack on the Italian front.LORD CAVAN, in reply to questions by Mr. Hughes, Sir robert borden, and others, said that, if the Germans decided to con-oentrate on the Italian front, they would probably get lo or12 days1 start &quot;before we discovered their intention.    Gonse-quently, they would get 5 divisions to the front before we knew what they were doing,    in the next week they would bring5 more, while we could only bring 2.GENERAL SMUTS pointed out, however, that the Allies already had 5 divisions on that front, so that the discrepancy wouldnot be very great.LORD CAVAN, continuing to reply to questions, said that,according to his calculations the Germans oould not mount agreat attack, say, by 24 divisions, including all the prepara**tions,before September 15.    General Diaz, however, thought they could mount an attack by September 1,   He did not thinkthat the Germans would allow the Austrians to make theirpreparations fpr the attack on their behalf, as Signor Nittihad suggested to the Prime Minister they might do.GENERAL HARINGTON concurred in this view and said it tooktroops some little time to get accustomed to their surround-ings and size up the local conditions.LORD CAVAN and GENERAL HARINGTON both agreed that itwould be a perfectly logical decision if the Germans abandon--qed their attacks on the Western front and mounted an attack

in Italy.   By these means they would he able to make use ofthe advantage they had of more rapid ooncentration.*Lord GAYAN said that if he were in Ludendorff *s position hewould not hesitate to order the adoption of a particular defen-csive position on the Western front and to mount an attack in italy.in reply to Mr. Hughes, LORD CAVAN and GENERAL HARINGION ex-pressed the view that, notwithstanding a failure of the much-heralded attack on the Western front, ludendorff would not hes**itate to turn his attention to the Italian front if he thoughthe oould get gre;at military advantages thereby.   Without under-rating the effect on the psychology of the German people of anabandonment of the much advertised offensive in the West, they considered that the Military party in Germany would find suf-ficient reasons to justify an attack on Italy*MR 1LOYD GEORGE pointed out that a big success in italy would itself be sufficient justification.MR HUGHES pointed out that if the Germans did take such adecision, they would conceal their intentions by a number of attacks at different points in the West.,, so as to create theimpression that they were still keeping up their main offensivethere.GENERA1 HARINGTON agreed in this view.MR 110YD GEORGE reminded lord Cavan that some 3 weeks agohalf-a-dozen German divisions had been lost sight of, and ithad been believed at the time by General Diaz that they werebeing sent to the Italian front.   Eventually, however, theyhad turned up on the Alsace front., 10RD CAVAN said that General Diaz had some reason for hisdeduction, because the German divisions that had been lostsight of had been the very divisions that had assisted the austrians in, their attack last autumn, and it was, therefore,not (an unnatural deduction that the same troops had been

sent, owing to their local experience, &quot;back to the ItalianfrontsGENERAL KARIUGTON said he could not answer, without care-ful consideration, a question &quot;by Mr. Hughes as to how many &apos;divisions the Germans could safely take from the western front.The answer would depend upon so many considerations,such as thestrength and condition of the divisions, &amp;c,SIR ROBERT BORDEN asked whether lord Cavan had any views asto American divisions?SHE MR LLOYD GEORGE said that this point had also &quot;been press-ed by Signor Nitti, who was very anxious to have American di-visions on the Italian front.LORD CAYAN said he would be very glad to have an Americandivision under him.    If one was sent to be put under the french command, he thought that we should press to have one under his Command also.    If the Italian Higher Command would con-sent, very good training grounds oould be found for the Amer-ioan divisions, and he considered that, if 3 American divisions were sent, and the demands that General Diaz had made for am-munition and equipment were met, the situation would then be such as to render an offensive possible.MR HUGHES pointed out the political importance of gettingsome hold on Austrian territory before the Peace Conference.On the Western front it was evident that it would be a veryslow business to drive the Germans back to the Rhine.    It didnot appear possible to do this in the present year, or nextyear, even with the American assistance, although, perhaps,it might be accomplished the year after.LORD CAYAH agreed in the difficulty of driving the Germansback to the Rhine.   It might be possible to enter Austria,but on the mountain front it was not possible to penetrateany very great distance with a large Army, owing to the diffi-cult mountain country that had to be traversed and the

inadequacy of the communications.    On the other hand, to cross the Piave was, in his opinion, bad strategy, as the moment theItalian Army penetrated to the eastward along the plains,their lines of communication would become menaced from theNorth,in reply to Mr. Lloyd George he expressed doubt as towhether a more overwhelming disaster could be inflicted onthe Austrian Army by attacking and pursuing them in the plains.To take Trent from Austria would be almost as serious as totake Milan from Italy, which would be a very great disaster.(SIR ROBERT BORDEN withdrew at this po&apos;int).GENERAL HARINGTON agreed in this view.    He was confident that the moment the Italians advanced to the eastward, german divisions would appear on the northern Frontier.LORD CAVAN said that the tactical difficulties of an attackon the mountain front were not so great as might be supposed,owing to the large amount of dead ground.   Even on our front of attaok it had been found that men could reach the wire and out it, while under cover in dead ground, and it was very dif-fioult to reach them with bombs.   All the Officers and soldiershe had spoken to on the subject had agreed that they would ra*ther attack than defend on a mountain front.    The main diffi*culty was strategical, insomuoh as if the Armies penetratedfar to the North their transport difficulties became so great.(At this point GENERAL MACDOHOGH entered).MR LLOYD GEORGE resumed, for General macdonogh*s benefit,the information and views communicated by Signor Nitti.GENERAL macdonogh said that it was quite impossible that signor Nittirs information about the relative strength of theAn.strian^ and Italian Armies was correct.   As a matter of fact,

there were 59 Austrian divisions against 56 or 61 Allied di-visions, according as the Cavalry divisions and Czeoho-Slovakdivisions were included or not.   Even if every Austrian divi-sion were brought over to the Italian front, they would nothave a superiority of 20 divisions, since they only had 15 inRussia and 3 in the Balkans.    Aocording to his calculations. 2oGerman divisions could he brought to the Italian front in 6weeks by pooling the German and Austrian rolling-stock, whichwas the limiting factor,    if the troops passed out from Bel-belgium, he would expect to detect the movement in a week, but ifthey passed out on the other route, it might take a fortnightto pick up a particular division.   We should be bound to knowvery soon of any large movement of 20 divisions, or even of,say, 4 divisions in a week.    His personal opinion was that theGermans would probably make another effort on the western front, and most likely somewhere on the British front.    Therewas no sign,as far as he knew from G.H.Q., of an attack com-ing within the next 48 hours on the British front, but princeRupprecht still had 28 quite fresh divisions, with 8 more whichcould be brought in in the latter part of a battle, and an at-tack could be mounted almost anywhere on the British frontwithin 48 hours.general . SMUTS confirmed this opinion as the result of his recent visit to G.H.Q.    He thought it probable that the enemy would wait until the situation was steadier on the southern front before deciding on an attack, but there were some signs that the Battle-front in the south was being gradually stabil-ised.GENERAL MA.CD01T0GH said that 58 German divisions had now been engaged on the Western front.    Tbe total number of German di-visions on that front was 204.    The total number of prince Rup-prechtrs divisions was 81.In reply to a question, he said that his intelligence had proved perfectly correct as to the position of every Austrian

division at the beginning of the reoent Austrian attack.    Hehad also been perfectly correct as to the number of German di-visions used on the Italian front last autumn when the ItalianGerman attaok on the Italian front, in the course of which general Smuts pointed out that it would be a tremendous de-cision for the Germans to take to give up their much advertis-ed attaok on the Western front, the failure of which,&apos;he ob-served, they were attributing - not without reason      totreachery by prisoners and deserters.    It was not unlikely,therefore, that they would make one more attempt, taking everysafeguard against further treachery.    On the other hand, itwas pointed out that the enemy had lost a fortnight, whichwould enable about 140,000 more Americans to be brought intoFrance, in addition to 100^000 becoming fully trained.The discussion was adjourned, LORD CAYAiir being asked to delay his department-rture until after thereturn of the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff from France, as tftwr MR LLOYD GEORGEwould wish to confer with the two of them before giving a reply to Signor Uitti onThursday.finformation had proved quite incorrect.There was some further discussion on the probability of aWhitehall Gardens, S.WJuly S4t 1918.\\IS.
