HE WESTERNIRONT.ffiCHANGEL.BHERiUj MIS-fARY POLICY.(1) The Chief of the Imperial General staff reportedthat there was no special news from the Western front.During: the morning, however, reports were received of a french advance which had reached two kilometres on a front of 8 kilometres north-west of Fere-en-Tardenois.( $ The Chief of the Imperial General staff said he hadreceived a telegram from General poole indicating that an advance guard of the force intended to attack Archangelhad already left Murmansk, and was being followed by themain force consisting of 1,500 British, 900 French, and a mixed force of 300 Americans, poles, and Russians, makinga total of about 2,700 men, besides the ships1 companies.The enemy 3assfc at Archangel was estimated to number 8,000,but it was hoped that a rising against the Bolshevistswould occur in Archangel simultaneously with the landing.The first attack would not be on Archangel itself, but onthe Island of M^Lu^^aM^.(3) The Prime Ministers then continued their discussion on General Military Policy.THE PRIME MINISTER said he attached great importanceto the discussions of the previous day. and more particu-larly to General smuts  objections to operations intendedto improve the present front this year.    If such opera-tions were to be undertaken it must he presumed that thiswould occur late in the year when bad weather may have set in.SIR ROBERT BORDEN said that,on the previous, evening,hehad been told in confidence and great secrecy that theCanadian Army Corps, which had lately been in the region of Arras, was now being moved forward into another region^and he had some reason to &quot;believe that the intention wasto employ them offensively.    This looked as if the operastions for improving pur front might he about to commence,

THE CHIEF OE THE IMPERIAL GENERAL staff said He knewnothing of any forthcoming operation.MR MASSET said that it obviously could not he part ofany big offensive, and he expressed doubt as to the wis-dom of interfering in any minor operation.LORL MILNER said it was necessary to distinguish be-tween minor operations and a big offensive like the attack in Elanders last year.   If a mere rectification of theline was contemplated, that was entirely within GeneralEochrs responsibility. N\THE PRIME MINISTER disputed this.    It was, he said, thebusiness of the Government to weigh up its resources.    Ifthey found that their forces were being reduced too low,it was their business to exercise restraint on their Gen-erals.   He inclined to the view that sufficient restraint in this respect had not been exercised last year, whenno less than 800,000 men had been handed over to the Army.Next year this could not be done.    Consecxuently, our Gen-erals ought not to be given the same freedom.   At presentthe withdrawal of a few thousands from industry, such as shipping and shipbuilding, produce! the most far-reachingresults,    ihe recent withdrawal of a few thousand engin-volunteers had caused the Tank programme to fall by a half.General Pooh, though a considerable General and a goodstrategist, did not take any thought of this aspect ofthe question.   He had always been somewhat reckless of hu-man life, and as an instance of this the PRIME MINISTERmentioned the campaign in Artois in 1915.   He always seem-ed to proceed on the assumption that the numbers of menwere inexhaustible.    Only in February of the present yearhe had produced a calculation, according to which GreatBritain still had a reserve of 2,000,000 men.   He had

Sientirely overlooked, the importance of producing coal and shipbuilding, &amp;c.    It was not possible for the Governmentto transfer its responsibility In this respect to GeneralPoch.   If the operations, contemplated were merely minoroperations, such as those recently carried out so success-fully by the Australians at Villers Brettonneux and else-itwhere,/would not be a case for interference,- but the Gov-emment ought to know what was intended.    He, therefore,asked the Chief of the Imperial General staff to ascertain from General Foch what the scope of the operations, was0If the operations contemplated by the Chief of the im-perial General Staff were on a large scale, THE PRIME MH?-ISEER said he was in entire agreement with General SmutsIn opposing theme    One reason was that the present sal-ients occupied by the enemy caused a great extension ofthe line.    In the past this had been an advantage to theenemy, and a disadvantage to us, because the enemy had hadthe numerical superior!ty*   Now, however, that the super-priority was gradually transferring to our side, it would bean advantage to us and a disadvantage to the enemy.   Theenemy knew this as well as we did, and in all probabilityas the number of his divisions decreased, he would retreatto hold a shorter line.   Why, therefore, should we squan-der lives to achieve an object we could attain withoutfighting?   He gathered from the General Staff memorandum that our big attack would not take place until July.   would it not be better, therefore, to postpone any preliminaryoperations until next spring?   Up to the present autumn,on some date between September and November, the allies would have no superiority over the enemy on the western front.   By spring, however, the balance would have tippedthe other way, and the Allies would possess a substantialsuperiority.   By that time also our troops would be better

trained, than at present.   We ourselves had. a good many par-tially trained troops, and this applied even more to  mer-ioa.   Consequently, by postponing until the spring weshould have better trained troops in greater numbers.Another consideration was that we ought to give our troops the impression that we regarded their lives as es-essential to the State.   At present the impression probablyprod.used was that their lives were of comparatively minorvalueo    They ought to understand that they were only toI be asked to take great risks at times of important crises,and they could then be relied on to run every risk.THE PRIME MINISTER then asked General Harington if hehad formed any estimate of casualties in connection withthe General Staff Memorandum?GENERAL HARniGTOH replied that it was proposed to employSO British divisions In the offensive, but the remainder of the divisions would be available for roulement, and in course of time would be brought into the attack, so that by the end all the divisions would be employed.    If theArmy received the mechanical transport and Tanks on thescale desired, he believed that casualties would be 50 percent, less than In the past.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that after a certain pointin the battle it was generally found that Tanks were of noavail, and then the big casualties would occur.    This is what had happened in the recent prench counter-offensiveoGEHERAIi HARIHGTOH said our view was that the Prench hadnot made the right tactical use of Tanks.    They had put the mall in at the outset of an attaok and had kept no reserv-es.    This plan was not in accordance with the ideas we had formed.   He thought we should be able to maintain from 43to 45 divisions in the field throughout next year.

S3THE PRIME MINISTER asked to what extent we could maintainthese divisions.    He had nevex been able to obtain a bal-ance sheet from any General Staff.    It was not a businessproposition, however, to enter into an operation of thiskind without a balance sheet of income and loss of man-power *   The Imperial War Cabinet were in a position of aBoard of Directors, and it was their duty to obtain andstudy such a balance sheet before they sanctioned an op-erationo   in the General Staff Memorandum he could not find a syllable as to income or wastage.   He asked if theGeneral Staff had any notion of the strength that our army would have at the end of next year,    if it would lead toour having, at the end of the year, a broken Army of aboutSO divisions, the decision was more political than milit-ary, and was, therefore, one for the Cabinet..   In the past,casualties had nearly always been under-estimated,   prior tothe somme offensive he himself had had an argument withPield Marshal Haig on this subject.    The Field Marshal had said that he would stop the attaok wjien we had sustainedSOO,000 casualties, but this had not been done.   The wholeof the gains in the Somme battle had been recovered bythe Germans and more ground with it In about S4 hours onthe Slst March.   We were not in a position to repeat that experience.    The Government were the trustees for the mostgallant troops the world had ever seen.   Before they 0om-mitted them to an offensive they ought to know how they stood in regard to income of man-power, estimated casual-ties, and the position at the end of the operations.   Menwere the only thing that we could not replace,    personally,he did not intend to assent to any proposal which commit-ted us to give General Pooh or anyone else a free hand un-less he was satisfied on these points.

THE CHIEF 01? THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF pointed out thathis forecast that our present forces of 59.divisions would,by July next, be reduced to 43, was      not an inadequateone.    The General Staffs estimates were that, during nextyear we could maintain a force of 43 divisions, taking all the punishments of heavy fighting.    It was difficultto say exactly what our income was, because the GeneralStaff did not know whether it was intended to conscriptIreland^THE PRIME MINISTER doubted whether even if Irish re-emits were obtained they would provide efficient fightingmaterial in the existing conditions of Ireland.   He suggest-ed that the General Staff in making their balance sheetshould take alternative forecasts.    He asked what was theGeneral Staff*s estimate of its income without the Irish?THE CHIEF 01? THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF said their es-legitimate was for 25,000 a month.&quot;LORD MILNER pointed out that the 25,000 men a monthwould not provide for the wastage of the Army,except on theassumption that a number of divisions were reduced,therebyproviding a pool of men over and above the regular income for the maintenance of the remaining divisions.   The posi-tion was somewhat similar to that when the War cabinet decided to reduce the divisions from 12 to 9 battalions.THE PRIME MINISTER expressed doubt as to whether, even so,, we could maintain a force of 43 divisions to the endof next year*s campaign. , ^  ,MR HUGHES said that Australia had j^fc790,00G men a    ^year in the field to maintaxh&quot;&quot;&quot;a&quot;&apos;To&apos;FcT&apos;&quot;&quot;of o&quot;Hvi^ion^.   if that test were applied to British man-power some ideaoould be formed of the numbers required.THE PRIME MINISTER said this tended to confirm his7o

doubts.   He did not put much faith in the anticipations of reducing losses by means of mechanical applianoes.    Onthe first day of an attack the losses were always moder-ate.    In this connection he instanced Arras.   About thethird day, however, the losses would begin to creep up, and thereafter they would become heavy.   What he wanted was afull examination of the figures by the General Staff.    he also wanted an examination of General smuts  propositions,namely, as to whether it would not be practicable to knockthe props from under the German Empire.    The Allies werein a position similar to that of an Army laying siege toa fortress; consequently, they should attack the weakestand not the strongest point of the line0In reply to Mr, Massey,he was unwilling to express afinal opinion as to where the weak parts were, the only thing we could be sure of was that they were not on theGerman front.       ^1R&apos;SDGHBS&quot;added &quot;thatjjjjjgacould not afford to attack it&amp;t^In his view we ought not to have incurred the losses wehad sustained in the past.GENERAIi SMUTS pointed out that having sanctioned the ,attack it had been extremely difficult to stop it. .THE PRIME MI1TISTER said the Government could have stop-ped it if they had had the moral courage to do It.   had they done so, however, the Military.Authorities would haveinsisted that they had been on the point of breakingthrough, that the enemy was demoralised, and at the last moment they had been stopped by civilian politicians.MR MASSEY said that the attack on passchendaele oughtnever to have been proceeded with.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that hithertotack on the Western front had failed with heavy losses.

THE PRIME MINISTER said, that in September the Governmenthad done their best to stop the Passchendaele attack, butit had been represented to them that the losses were, af-ter all, not so heavy, and the figures produced were ad-justed to the estimates,.   This must not occur again.   ThePrime Ministers of the Dominions before leaving must allshare the responsibility with him for future operations.We must not again be led into operations on bright antici-pations of the enemy running away, or owing to promises of a new type of Tank.   We must fully examine the probably-ilities before sanctioning the operations.MR MASSEY said it was only fair to remember that wehad had very bad luck.    The weather had always been against us, not only In Flanders, but again on March 81, whendense fQg had supervened.   Of course, he had only heardthe question discussed from the Dominions point of view,but he believed that the disaster of March 21 was largely due to the Flanders offensive.    He hoped that, in the fu-ture, more consideration would be taken of human life.MR HUGHES said it was only fair to say that If Austral-ia had been consulted, he himself would have opposed thePassohendaele offensive.    He wished, however, agaxn toemphasise that, if the British Empire won a victory on thefield of battle, but bled to death in the process - (andin this connection he pointed out that Australia had al-ready sustained 250,000 casualties, including 50,000deaths) - and then had to go to a peace Conference, weshould have gained the shadow but lost the substance.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that the substance wouldhave passed to America.At this point the prime Ministers discussed the question as to their constitutional position vis-a-vis General Foch.It was suggested that by the Beauvais Agreement we were9.

not entitled to interfere with. General Foch, unless field marshal Haig had reported that the British. Army was en-danger ed.    On the other hand, it was pointed out thatField Marshal Haig was hound to. submit any big operation to the Government, that is to say, any operation of the magnitude that would involve heavy casualties.    The Govern-ment then had the responsibility of deciding whether theywould sanction these operations or not.   up to the present general Foch had not submitted any proposal, and the primeMinisters were only considering the iLeas of the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff as to next year*s campaign. Itwas generally agreed that, if General Foch were to decide on a plan such as that proposed by the Chief of the imper-ial General staff, the British Government would not befunctus officiQoME HUGHES pointed out the risk that, in the present state of politics in Germany, the German Higher Commandmight retaliate on a minor operation, with a view toconverting it into a major operation, and consequently we might become committed by minor operations to major opera-tions without desiring it.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPEEIAX. GEEERAIi STAFF said that Gen-eral Foch had never seen his plans,and might disagree inevery word of them.   He had not discussed them with general foch. . All that he contemplated for&apos; the present autumn^however, was that we should like to force the enemy intothe mud of Flanders for the winter, and to take zemmel;we should like to disengage the Bruay coalmines, and throwthi enemy back from Amiens.    This only involved advancesof a few thousand yards,    it was often a relatively cheapand easy matter to advance a short distance.10 0

GENERAL HARINGTON, In this connection, pointed out thatthe recent operations at Meteren and Merris had been ear-ried out with very little cost, because, apparently, forsome reason which he could not explain, the Germans werenot fighting in this region^THE PRIME MINISTER agreed that operations of this type,or the type carried out by the Australians at Villers Bret-tonneux, were unobjectionable.LORD MILKER pointed out that they had no relation to the class of operation carried out last year in Flanders*THE PRIMS MINISTER again returned to the question of a balance sheet of casualties.   He read from a return hand-ed to him by the Secretary, that the casualties for thelast two months had averaged 35,000 a month, without in-cluding sick, but including the casualties of the Domin-ions forces.MR MASSEY pointed out that a proportion of the woundedwould return.There was some discussion on this subject, in the courseof which MR HtTGHES mentioned that the Australian casual-ties for the last two years had not been much less than100 per cent, of the total/^forci&quot;, while THE PRIME MINISTERmentioned that the British casualties xec from the 1st jan-uary to the  1st July were about half a million.MR MASSEY asked if we could not obtain some Idea as towhat General Foch. proposed to do between now and the endof the year.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF said that whenhe last saw him General Foch had hoped to win to the linenotof the &quot;Vesle..   At that time he bad/contemplated any bigattack on the Germans, and had not expected that theGermans would attack us.   He himself thought that ifHo

General luderuiorff were strong enough he.vso^ulcLrthis autumncould not imagine the Germans sitting still and doingnothlngZ&apos;   It was contrary &apos;to their whoTe tradltionoTHE PRIME MINISTER pointed out also that time was against the Germans, and that they would wish to take ad-vantage of the period while they still possessed numeri-cal superiority.10RD&apos; MILNER pointed out that from the. purely british point of view time was against us also, since our Army ofthe future was hound to he reduced in numbers0GENERAI SMUTS said that it was important, before fu-ture operations, were discussed between the General staff and General Foch, that the Government should have theirbalance sheet.    Otherwise, they might find that victoryhad only caused their Army to disappear.MR MASSEY drew attention to the very bad effect oflord Xansdowne*s letter on public opinion.MR HUGHES said that the more he contemplated the pros-pects of a 3*eaoe Conference held under the conditions that german Military power was not broken, the more appallingthe outlook seemed.   In the near future we might expectGermany to make peace offers, perhaps attractive ones, andwe should be put in a very awkward position.    Consequent-ly, it would be a good thing if we could gsi/them as soonas possible.THE PRIME MINISTER asked if this meant that Mr. Hugheswould be prepared for us to plunge beyond Our means, or would he prefer to limit our strategy to our income.    Ifthe latter course, then the General Staff ought to be told that this,was the case. ^   , .. , ,try to knock out either the itaiiahs&quot;or ^meWBmaaSes^   Hebeat

THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF pointed outthat on page 8, paragraph 20, he had made the assumptionthat neither this country nor Prance could he relied onto continue fighting a defensive war without making a realattempt for a decision until 1930.    He had given hisgrounds for making this assumption.    If,he was allowed tomake some other assumption, he sssfe^iT^^j^off the attempt at a decision until 1920.THE PSIME MINISTER asked whether General Wilson reallythought in his heart that, with the means at their dispos-al, the Allies could get a decision on the Western frontnext year, taking into consideration the rate at which theAmerican Army could be developed, and without assuming the collapse of Austria?THE CHIEF OP THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF said his replyto this question was that he would like to start workingup to an attack on July 1 next year.   As the time approach-ed we should be able to judge as to whether we had any real chance of success.    Otherwise, we could postpone.THE PRIME- MINISTER said he was in the position of one who, once bitten, was twice shy.   Year after year he hadreceived the same answer to his question,   in 1915 thewhole Cabinet, including even Lord Kitchener, had beendoubtful as to the expediency- of an offensive.   Lord Kit-ehener had then said: &quot;Let,s work up to it and then, whenthe moment comes, we can decide.n   As a matter of fact,however, the Cabinet were never asked a second time.    Thesame had happened in 1916, and again in 1917.   As the mo-ment for the attack approached, the Cabinet would be told that all the preparations had been made, and that ^embassy itwould break the spirit of the Army if the attack was notlaunched.    The same had been said in this very room almosta year ago in regard to the Italian attaok on the Izonso.

SIR ROBERT BORDEN said that we were hound to considerwhether we would attack at all, and, if so, when? If werejected the General staff1s plan, what were we going for?THE PRIME MINISTER suggested thsrt. General smuts  alter-native of Italy.SIR ROBERT B GREEN said that the King of Italy dad re-cently told a Canadian who had paid a four days1 visit tothat front, that the enemy was supported by two props, onethe German prop, which was strong; the other, the Austrianprop, which was weak.    This seemed to put the matter ina nutshell*MR MASSEZ asked how the Allies were to get at Austria*We must presuppose ourselves strong enough to hold theWestern front.    Should we have sufficient margin for&apos;oper-ations against Austria as well?THE PRIME MINISTER turned to the Table on page 7 ofthe General Staff Memorandum, and -quoted, the follo?/ingfigures;-Rifle strength of the Allies.........1,703,000Sectshs:     ditto. Germans........1,230,000.This gave a margin of 470,000.    The Germans last year, by sending 6 divisions to help the Austrian Army, had pract-ically smashed the Italian Army.    In the margin he hadquoted we had the equivalent of 40 divisions.GENERAL SMUTS pointed out that the enemy also had aneye on Italy, which was important from defensive, no lessthan from the offensive point of view.   If the enemyreached Turin and Milan, Italy would be knocked out of thewar.MR MAS SET asked what the position would be if we didsucceed in knocking out Austria?   should we then be ahleto beat Germany?

GENERAL SMUTS said that it would enable us to carry ourown people on to continue the War to 19&amp;0.MR MASSEY said he was afraid of looking to 1920 at all.He apprehended that by that time Lord Lansdowners argu-ments would be carrying great weightsSIR ROBERT BORDEN asked if the Italians would continue in the War?THE PRIME MINISTER replied that they were bound to,because they were dependent on us for coal and bread. IfAustria were knocked out he thought the Germans would give in*LORD MILNER said that he was inclined to agree withthe Chief of the imperial General Staff that we ought notto postpone our final effort until 1920*   We were now reaela stage when diplomacy was as important as military oper-ationsoTHE PRIME MINISTER said that&apos;they ought to go hand inhand.GENERAL SMUTS agreed that our campaigns should be di-plomatic as well as military in their intention.THE CHIEF OP THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF said he had put forward the same idea in the last paragraph of hisMemo randum.MR HUGHES asked ho?/ many men would be needed by theAllies in Italy to achieve a decision there.    He was notcriticising adversely, but only asking for informationssixLord Cavan had said that if ml German divisions were brought up he himself would not feel much dismay, butthat the French General held a different view.    If we andthe Americans put in 12 or 14 divisions, would it have so great an effect 0n Austria as to compel the withdrawalof Germans from the Western front?THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF said that lord CavanTs estimate,to reach Trent was for 18 British15 o ^

French, or American divisions; that is to say, 13 morethan we had at present on the Western front. We couldnot spare these this year.ME HUGHES asked how we should stand in this respectnext year?THE OHIBE OE THE IMPERIAL GENERAL staff said that the.   .. ....difficulty was that before you oould advance eastward ofthe Piave, you must secure the northern flank, which mocbfcmeant an attack towards Trent.    This would take your Arm-ies into the High Alps, and any considerable movementsmust be confined to the valleys.    The railway accommoda^tion, however, on the enemy&quot;s railways, was much superior to that of the Allies, even after the contemplated improve-ments to the Modane railway had been effected.    Oonsequent-ly, the moderate numbers required to block the valleysoould rapidly be brought from Germany.   If there.were noGermans, there was no doubt that we could do a good dealagainst the Austrians.   Generally speaking, the mountainswere not available for military operations after Novem-ber,and before November we oould not spare the necessaryforces.   Operations would not again be possible untilMarch or April.   His proposal was to send 3 or 4 divisions to winter in Italy.   This would not unduly weaken the West**ern front.   He agreed that there was a great deal In whatyi\;&apos;v&quot;X&apos;General Smuts had to propose, but it had to be considered from the point of view of dates, snow in the mountains, and- the mud in France.MR HUGHES said that he drew the deduction from theGhief of the Imperial General staffs remarks that weshould not be able to get very far against Austria.    TheGermans, in fighting a defensive campaign on the West,would always be able to detach the moderate forces neo-essary to hold us: up in the valleys, and we should never

have sufficient superiority on the West to compel them tokeep all their forces there.Che Prime Ministers decided that -The Ohief of the Imperial General staff should takethe following: actions *(i) To prepare a balance sheet of income and espend-iture in man-power involved In the operations for 1919, proposed in his Memorandum;(ii) To form an estimate of what the man-power posi-tion of the British Army would he at the end ofthe year 1919 on the completion of the operationsproposed;fiii) To report as to the possibility of knocking outAustria, taking into consideration the informa-tion communicated by the prime Minister on theprevious day:(cessation\ To report as to the possibility of getting Bui-Bulgaria and Turkey out of the War by means ofdiplomacy, combined with our military effort;(v) To ascertain the scope of any offensive opera-..tions contemplated by General pooh in the immed*.iate future,,(4) The Prime Ministers had a short discussion on thesubject of Tanks, and their use for saving man-power.GENERAL HARINGTON said that the original indent hadbeen for 8,400 Tanks, but General seely had lately Inform.,ed him that we could not produce muGh more than half that number,,   Mr. Ohurchillts latest information on the subject,however, was that he hoped to produce within 1,500 of theoriginal Indent.   At present we had 400 MssmSgsam Mark If,Tanks, which we should have to use as best we oouldo   Wehad 5 Brigades, each containing 3 Tank Battalions, whichwere all to be armed with Mark V. Tanks.   In addition there was the Mark Till, heavy Tank, and there was a newdesign for a medium Tank intended to reach a speed of 20miles an hour.   We also had a medium OTwhippet&quot; Tank thatwould run at lo miles an hour.y 17o

THE PRIME MINISTER expressed his intention of summon-ing a Meeting of all those concerned in the output of tanks,MR HUG-HES said he would like to know what was the ef-feet of withdrawing 5,000, 10,000* or 20,000 men from themanufacture of Tanks,   No doubt it, was Infantry that wonthe battles;ithe preparation was very important.18 o
