SECRET.NOTE BY THE SECRETARY.I saw the Prime Minister this morning, and he decided that itwould he better not to circulate these draft Minutes, partly ow-ing to the secrecy of the subjects involved, and partly because he thought that,at this stage, to circulate formal Minutes, would tend to stifle discussion.    The Minutes, therefore, should onlybe regarded as Secretary&apos;s Notes to be used if and when a report is made of the subjects discussed by the prime Ministers.Secretary.June 22, 1918.

Ithb western(FRONT,urn mmiReinf orce-ments from palestine.(2) The Conference then proceeded to discuss a proposal of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff to withdraw the following forces from Palestine to reinforce the Armyin Prance:-(a) The 54th British Division;(b) Australian troops of the equivalent of onemounted division.    (G.T.4837).Mr. Lloyd George explained that 2 divisions and 20battalions had already been withdrawn from Palestine, the battalions withdrawn having been replaced by Indian bat-taliions.    This left a force of about lijr divisions of white troops in that theatre.Lord Milner explained that if the proposal of the Chiefof the Imperial General staff was adopted, the combatantstrength of the Allied forces in Palestine would be re-duced from 147,000 to 125,000 men -- (bdtween one-third and one-fourth of which only would be White troops) -as compared with an estimated enemy combatant strengthof 112,500 men.    The comparison of rifle strength wouldbe 88,000 allied rifles and sabres to 68,000 enemy.    TheAllied forces included about 18,000 Australian troops.He read a telegram, dated 16th June, 1918, from the Gen-eral Officer Commanding in Chief in Egypt, No.E.A.1329,containing a full appreciation of the situation, in thecourse of which General Allenby expressed the view thatsome months would elapse before 22 of the Indian battal-ions, which had seen no service and&apos;were in various stag-es of training, could be considered thoroughly reliable,and that, to take away more British or Dominion troops,involved a serious risk.    While obliged to point out the risks, however, General Allenby stated that, if the WarCabinet decided to sanction the proposal of the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff, he could be relied on to do

all he could to hold all the ground gained in Palestinewith the troops left at his disposal.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff, in support of theproposal, pointed out that there was not the smallest doubtthat we must expect further very heavy attacks in France,to meet which we had only a very slight margin of strength inhand, if any.    The Australian troops could be in France by july ik 17, and the 54th division could be there by July 21,and, as far as he could foresee, we should, on these dates,still be fighting for our lives on the Western front.    general foch never ceased to press us to send more men to France,inhere the need for men was very great.    The Allies had al-ready sustained 4 very heavy attacks on the Western front, andhad suffered 4 reverses.    It was true that we were better pre-pared than on the previous occasions,   nevertheless, in some places we could afford to give very little ground.    The im-portant railway eentre of Doullens, for example, was only 15 .miles behind the front.    In Palestine, even after the with-drawal of these forces, we should still possess a substantialnumerical superiority, as shown by Lord Milner.    He admitted that some of the Allied units would be of inferior quality.He did not think, however, that we should be running any ser-ious risk in Palestine, by withdrawing these divisions.    his idea would be, if we succeeded in restoring the situation onthe Western front, to send reinforcements to Palestine inthe autumn, and he considered that General Allenby, even af-ter the withdrawal of these forces, should be able to main-tain his position against any attack that could come before then.    In order to maintain our position on the Western front^we had not hesitated to withdraw men from Home Defence, and,from Salonica, and General Foch had not hesitated .to withdrawmen from the southern wing of the French Army.   He thought we ought to pursue a similar policy in Palestine.3 D

General Smuts pointed out that the military advantages whichthe Allies had gained over the enemy had all been outside europe, and the most striking of these were in Palestine and mesopotamia.    By our successes in Palestine we had secured the defence of Egypt, and a good deal more.   We ought not,therefore, lightly to endanger the position we had won there.All accounts agreed that the Turks, even in defeat, weresplendid fighters, and in the autumn, when the enemy wouldbe in a position to attack there, he \?ould be considerablystronger than before.    He felt a good deal of doubt as towhether, if these troops were once transferred to the western front, we should ever be able to send them back to Palestine.We had to remember that the Supreme Command in France wasFrench, and that the French nation always looked on the West-era front as the main point of danger to the Allies.    Conse-quently, he doubted if General Foch would ever agree to send-,ing the troops back to Palestine.    If the German offensive inthe Wests: were brought to a standstill, it was probable thatthe enemy would then strike eastwards, and reinforce all theEastern theatres   Persia, Mesopotamia, and Palestine.    Hehad little doubt that the enemy was counting on our weakeningour strength in these minor theatres, and was watching thesituation intently.    The Germans were pledged to the Turks tore-establish the position&apos;in Palestine and Mesopotamia, andwould attack us as soon as they thought we were weakenedthere.    The East, however, v?as very important to the securityof the British Empire, hence, on a balance of advantage anddisadvantage he inclined strongly to the view that the wholeof the forces in question should be retained in Palestine,In the course of the discussion, great stress was laid on the vital importance of the Western front.    It was pointedout that if the Allied Armies in France were smashed the enemy

would be able to send such strong forces to the East that, inany ease, we should not be able to maintain our position any-where, and would be compelled to fall back entirely on navalwarfare.    This pointed to the desirability of concentratingevery man on the West, so far as this could be done withoutimperilling vital interests elsewhere.    On the other hand, itwas pointed out that Palestine was not a theatre where risksought to be taken, since a disaster there would not only in-volve the interruption of a main artery of our imperial com-munioations, but would react upon our whole situation in theEast, and even in India.    It was also generally felt that toreduce the stiffening of white troops unduly, and to rely en-tirely on Indian troops, a considerable proportion of whom were only partially trained, would be to run a great risk,particularly in the event of any reverse which, without a suf-ficient number of reliable troops to stem it, might be con-verted into a disaster.     It was further pointed out that, onthe Western Front, the proposed reinforcements would be asinconsiderable in proportion to the total Allied forces there,whereas they represented a substantial proportion of the Whitetroops in the Palestine theatre.The Ohief of the Imperial General Staff was asked whichforce he would prefer to transfer to the Western front, if only one,were decided on, namely, the 54th division, or theAustralian Mounted Division.    He pointed out that the advantt-age of withdrawing the Australian $$tinted Division was that;&quot;it would enable the Australian divisions on the Western frontsto be maintained at a full strength of 12 battalions.    Others\ [wise, they would probably have to be reduced to 9 battalions,which he greatly deprecated.    On the other hand, the Austral-ian troops in Palestine could be supplied direct from Austral-ia, thus avoiding the dangerous voyage through the Mediterran-ean

involved in the supply of the 54th division.While recognising that a certain element of danger was in-volved in the decision either way, on a review of the forego-ing considerations the Prime Ministers decided:-(a) That the 54th division should he &quot;brought toFrance s(b) That the Australian Mounted Division shouldhe left in Palestine.jALESTIl?E*      (3) In the course of the discussion recorded in the pre-Iiroposed vious Minute, the proposal was made that Mounted Troops shouldleinforce-lents of he raised in Australia, Hew Zealand, or South Africa, in orderlountedtroops fro$o to reinforce the Allied Army in Palestine-:.    In support oftzstralia,lew Zealand   this proposal it was pointed out that Mounted Troops couldW Southifrioa.     he more easily raised, and more rapidly trained than Infantryfor service in the Western theatre.    On the other hand, itwas pointed out that the great need at the present time wasu   drafts for the infantry in the Western theatre, and that theopening of recruiting for the more popular Mounted Service inPalestine would react on recruiting for the Western front. Asregards South Africa, it was pointed out that a Tank battalionwas being raised, and that recruiting for Mounted Forces mightreact on this.    General Wilson also pointed out the difficultyin maintaining the horses for the existing Mounted Forces inPalestine, owing to the great demand that the transport of horses and forage made on shippingsThe Prime Ministers decided that this proposal should not be folloxved up at present. , \-Ifp (4) The Prime Ministers discussed at considerable length   v*-gRECTIOI OF * ;   vf\p WAR,    certain of the problems connected with the higher direction and strategy of the VJar. \The view was expressed that the Dominions, all of which had made a very substantial contribution to the Imperial Forces,and whose collective effort was very great, should have a6* V

direct voice in the conduct of the far, and in the plans of campaign, so far as the War Cabinet had power to determinethem,    in this connection it was pointed out that during thefirst session of the Imperial War Cabinet the Representativesof the Dominions had shared in the decisions taken in regardto the conduct of the War, and it had been generally regret-ted that circumstances had rendered it impossible for Austral-ia to be represented.Mr. Lloyd George gave a resume of the circumstances in whichthe main operations of the War in 1917,subsequent to the first session of the Imperial War Cabinet, had been decided on. inthis connection he drew attention to the important Memorandafurnished by special request to the War Cabinet in October1917, by Field Marshal Lord French (W.P.6Q), and Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Wilson (W.P.61), which he asked his col-leagues to read. *In regard to the status and powers of General JToeh, Mr.Lloyd George said that he was not a Commander-in-Chief in the sense that he could control the appointment of officers under his command, at any rate not outside the Erench Army,    lor didhe directly control the services of supply.    He had, however,supreme direction ofaiXKiKccixaKsx/the strategy of the armies on the Western front,including the distribution of forces.There was some discussion as to the principles on which ap-pointments to the commands of armies, corps, divisions, andbrigades should be based.    In this connection General Wilsonexpressed the view that the correct principle was for theGovernment to appoint the Commander-in-Chief, who alone was ina pos ition to select his subordinate commanders.There was some discussion as to the desirability ojg givinggreater opportunities for promotion to officers of the newarmies, among whom were included men drawn from the most high-ly educated classes, men accustomed to the highest responsibii^..ity

in other professions, and many officers who had by now acquire a. great military knowledge and experience in nearly fouryears&apos;of active warfare.With a view to the resumption of this discussion:-\She Secretary was directed to circulate theReports by Field Marshal Lord $reneh (W.?o60),and Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Wilson&quot;,&apos; &quot;(W.P.61).Whitehall Gardens, S.W. .June 21, 1918.
