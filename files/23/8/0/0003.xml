Western Front. ]. The Director of Military Operations reported that the FourthArmy had attacked this morning north of St. Quentin, and had made good progress. If the report was true, the advance was important,as.the last organised line of the Hindenburg defences had been passed.There was no news of the contemplated French attack in Flanders.There were continued indications of a voluntary retirement on thepart of the Germans from the high ground north of Lens and fromthe Aubers ridge, due, doubtless, to a shortage of man-power. Thereare also indications that the Germans are contemplating the aban-donment of the Belgian coast.The First Sea Lord stated that naval indications also pointed toa possible evacuation of the Belgian coast. German craft had gonenorth in the last few days.Palestine Front. 2. The Director of Military Operations reported that general allenby had captured a further body of 1,500 Turks north of damascus. No news had been received regarding the progress ofGeneral Allenby&apos;s division which was advancing towards Beirutalong the coast.Macedonia.3. The Director of Military Operations stated that the identifi-cation of three German divisions two from Roumania and one fromthe Crimea on the Balkan front had now been verified. No news had been received from the interior of Bulgaria, but it was probablethat there were still some Germau troops in Sofia.Russia :The Position ofthe Czecho-Slovaks.4. The First Sea Lord reported that a telegram had been receivedfrom the commander of H.M.S. &quot; Suffolk &quot; giving information thatthe Czecho-Slovaks continued to receive alarming reports as to thesituation of their troops on the Volga. It was stated that they were completely exhausted by incessant fighting, and were doomed unlessAllied support was received immediately. British troops bad leftSpasskoe for the west on the 30th September. It was understoodthat the Americans were now prepared to send troops as far as Omsk.The total number of American troops which had arrived at vladivostock on the 29th September was 8,000. The Amur Railwaywas now in the hands of the Allies owing to the Japanese having made a junction with Allied forces operating from Chita.Aerial Activity.5. The First Sea Lord reported that on the 1st October some ofour aircraft operating in the ^aegean were attacked by four enemy aircraft, three of which were completely destroyed.Turkey. 6. Mr. Balfour asked, in view of possible political developments in Turkey, what might be the action taken by the Germans in regardto the &quot; Goeben.&quot;The First Sea Lord replied that there were three possible alternatives: Firstly, that the &quot;Goeben&quot; might attempt to escapethrough the Dardanelles to the Adriatic. If she were still capableof developing her own speed, which he personally thought was very doubtful, we had no ships in the Mediterranean which were fastenough to catch her.The second alternative would be to remain at Constantinople inorder to threaten the Turkish capital in the event of any Peaceovertures ; and the third alternative, which in his opinion was themost probable, was that the &quot; Goeben&quot; would move to Odessa or some other Black Sea port.
Propaganda in enemy Countries.8. The War Cabinet had before them a letter from the Secretaryof the Enemy Propaganda Department, forwarding a series ofResolutions which had been agreed to at an Inter-Allied Conferenceon propaganda in enemy countries held in London in August(G.T.-5492), together with a note by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs (G.T.-5677) dealing more particularlv with theReport of the Conference Committee on Policy.The Vfar Cabinet decided  To give their approval to the Resolutions of the Inter-allied conference, subject to the qualifications contained in the note by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.Representation ofthe People Act.- 9. With reference to War Cabinet 437, Minute 16, the WarCabinet had before them a memorandum by the President of theLocal Government Board (G.T.-5839) dealing with the dates forthe second Register, and suggesting that the qualifying period forthe second Register should be fixed as from six months ending the15th December, 1918.Mr. Hayes Fisher said that the first Register was incompleteand inaccurate to the extent of perhaps 10 per cent., and as theerror was on the side of including too many rather than toofew, he did not think that there would be any strong criticism of the Register from the House of Commons. It would be an administrative advantage if the end of the qualifying period for thesecond Register were fixed as the 15th December, and this was the482] B 2Prisoners of War. 7. With reference to War Cabinet 477, Minute 17, Lord Curzoncalled the attention of the War Cabinet to the statements appearing in the newspapers to the effect that the negotiations for the exchangeof prisoners with Germany had broken down. Some of the paperswere mentioning the position of the German residents in China asthe cause, and others were hinting at the case of the German sub-marine officers. There had been a telegram from The Hague statingthat the German Government had refused to ratify the Agreement on one or other of these grounds. He thought it was desirable, in viewof these newspaper rumours and also in view of the early meeting ofParliament, that a public statement should be made setting forth thepresent position.Sir George Cave said that he had prepared a draft communiquefor publication in the press, and that he had suggested to theForeign Office the desirability of arranging for the surrender ofprisoners by Bulgaria and, in the case of an armistice, by Turkey.The War Cabinet proceeded to consider the draft announcementprepared by the Home Secretary.Mr. fialfbur stated that the Chinese were entirely within their rights as a belligerent Power in interning German prisoners. Theonly influence we could exercise on China was that of argumentativepressure.Lord Robert Cecil reminded the War Cabinet that the allies had agreed to intern the leading Germans in China, and the ChineseGovernment were most unwilling to alter their policy having onceadopted it. The British Government had not been informed officiallythat the German Government were not prepared to ratify the Agree-ment fin- the exchange of prisoners, and he would put that in the forefront of any public announcement.The War Cabinet decided That the draft communique&quot; should be revised in the light ofthe discussion by the Home Secretary in consultation withMr. Balfour and Lord Robert Cecil before publication.
recommendation of his Advisory Committee. If, however, the &quot;WarCabinet preferred that the dates for the qualifying period mentionedin the Representation of the People Act should not be departedfrom, he would refer the matter back to his.Committee and ascertaintheir views thereon.The War Cabinet decided That the end of the qualifying period should be the15th January, unless there were very strong reasons tothe contrary, and the President of the Local GovernmentBoard felt it necessary to bring the matter again before theWar Cabinet.Reparation ofActs ofDevastation.10. With reference to W^ar Cabinet 481, Minute 8, theattention of the War Cabinet was called to an article which had appeared in &quot; I)er Tag,&quot; stating that if the Germans were forced towithdraw from Belgium, they would devastate the country during their retreat.Lord Robert Cecil stated that in this connection he had had an interview on the previous day with the French Ambassador, andhad conveyed to him the decision reached by the War Cabinet.The War Cabinet decided To await the reply of the French Government.Defence of the realm Acts:Regulation 40 d.11. With reference to War Cabinet 468, Minute 9, the WarCabinet, at the request of the Home Secretary, approved of theappointment of the following Royal Commission: Lord Moulton, G.B.E., K.C.B., F.R.S. (Chairman),Miss Flora Murray, O.B.E., M.D.,Mrs. H. B. Irving,Mrs. Found,The Lord Bishop of Southwark, D.D.,Lieutenant-General Sir Francis Lloyd, G.C.V.O., K.C.B.,D.S.O..Sir Malcolm Morris, K.C.V.O., F.R.G.S.,to consider the Defence of the Realm Act, Regulation 40d, what modifications (if any) hhould be made in its terms or in the procedure for enforcing it, and to report their conclusions as soon as possible,and in any case within two months, and the publication in the press of an announcement in the terms approved by the Home Secretary,Mr. Barnes, and Lord Robert Cecil.War Munitions 12. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theVolunteers&apos; Minister of Munitions (G.T.-5759) dealing with the subsistence allow-Subsistence Rates.   ance granted to War Munitions Volunteers, and recommending thatthe allowance be raised from 2s. 6d. per day to 3s. (id. per day.Mr. Churchill pointed out that the rate of 2s. 6d. had been fixed in the early days of 1915, and urged that the susequentincreased cost of living justified the advance, but that the Treasuryobjected.Mr. Barnes stated that he and General Smuts some months agohad met a number of trade union representatives, and had agreed torecommend to the Government the increase now proposed byMr. Churchill. He thought that the advance should be granted,but that care should be taken to exclude the building trades from it, as the building rates had always been based on the assumptionthat they would receive no subsistence allowance.In view of the meeting at which Mr. Barnes and General Smutswere present, and at which they bad promised to lay the case of the
Restoration of m 13, The War Cabinet had a preliminary discussion of the draftBat Fractlcee of a &quot; Restoration of Pre-War Practices &quot; Bill which had been circu-lated with a covering note by the Minister of Munitions, and a letterfrom Sir Stephenson Kent to the Minister of Reconstruction (G.T.-5617).Mr. Churchill stated that the Bill had been prepared by a Com-mittee containing representatives . of the Ministry of Munitions,Ministry of Labour, Ministry of Reconstruction, and the HomeOffice, with a view to giving statutory effect to the pledges whichthe Government had made to restore the practices surrendered bythe trade unions during the war. He was strongly against pro-ceeding with the Bill, as it was an attempt to achieve the impossible.n his view, the profound changes which had taken place during thewar had altered the conditions under which the Governmentspledges were given. Parliaments views of the obligations of the citizen in war time had been changed by the Military Service Acts.It was urged that it was important, in the event of a generalelection., that the Bill should be introduced before the dissolution ofParliament. To that it might be replied that a. large number ofwomen were about to be enfranchised, and to restore pre-war tradeunion practices would mean the exclusion of many of these women from industry. The proper Avay to meet the claims of the tradeunions was not to put an impossible Bill on the Statute Book, but to institute industrial conditions which would be far more satisfactory to the trade unions than pre-war conditions. If the War cabinet decided to proceed with the Bill, he was prepared to assist in passingit; but he hoped that it would be possible to find another Minister inmore complete sympathy with the Bill than be was who would pilotitthrough Parliament.Dr. Addison said that he shared Mr. ChurehuTs view of thegeneral subject, but a way of fulfilling the Governments promises hadto be found. Some time ago he bad approached representatives of theengineering trades with a view to securing a friendly agreement onthe subject, but both parties had declined to discuss the matter, andhad insisted that the first step must be taken by the Government.The trade unions held that their bargaining power with the masterswould be greatly strengthened once statutory effect had been givento the Governments pledges.Mr. Roberts concurred in the views set forth by Dr. Addison,and pointed out that the delay in introducing the promised Bill wasone of the basic causes of the prevailing unrest in the labour world.The pledge was one given by the Government to organised labourand it would be implemented.Lord Weir said that the agreement could perhaps better be described as a bargain than as a promise or a pledge.Sir Robert Home said that the agreement was already enshrinedin the Muuitions of War Act.Sir David Shackleton said that the matter had frequently come before Mr. Justice McCardie&apos;s Committee of Enquiry into LabourEmbargoes. That Committee was composed of three employers,three trade unionists, and three Government officials, and they were unanimous in holding that the Government was bound to givelegislative effect to the bargain with labour.War Munitions Volunteers before the Government and thereby-encouraged hopes that the claim would be granted,The War Cabinet decided  That the advance of Is. per day in the subsistence allowance should be granted to the War Munitions Volunteers.
It was suggested that it might be possible to submit the draftBill to a Joint Committee composed of representatives, of employersand employed, but it was the general opinion that the trade unionistswould refuse to serve on such a Committee.The War Cabinet decided To adjourn the discussion until the Prime Minister could attend.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,October 3, L&apos;.)18.
