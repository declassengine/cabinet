THE Director of Military  Intelligence reported that theGermans had counter-attacked the French on the previous day onthe Aisne, with success, but that the French are stated to haveregained most of the lost ground. East of Courtrai, the twocorps on the left of the Ilnd Army had attacked that morningalong the line of the Scheldt. From reports received, the attack was progressing very favourably.No official news had yet been received as to the successor ofGeneral Ludendorff, but it was stated in the press that GeneralGroener had been nominated to fill his place. General Thwaitesexpressed the opinion that, if this were correct, the appointment wasvery significant, as General Groener was neither a tactician nor a.strategist, but had been head of the Kriegs-Amt (War Bureau) andDirector of Railways, and therefore it appeared that he may havebeen appointed for the special purposes of dealing with reconstruction and demobilisation.[1365--494]
