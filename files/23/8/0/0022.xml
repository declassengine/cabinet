Movements ofBritish Troops inEurope.(a.) The Balkans.1. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that there wereone or two questions as to which he desired War Cabinet authority,regarding the movements of British troops in Europe. In the firstplace, there was the question of Generaf Milne&apos;s command in the balkans. General Wilson said that the Roumanians were proposing to move into Transylvania, and that the French were anxious toobtain a hold on Roumania, and wished, in that connection, to employ one of our divisions. He himself was opposed to the policyof our becoming involved in these operations, and would like toremove the 26th Division away from that theatre. He suggestedthat we should inform the French Government that, in view of thefact that military operations were now over, we propose to takeGeneral Milne away from General Franchet d&apos;Esperey&apos;s command.The First Lord of the Admiralty, on the other hand, pointed outthat, from a political point of view, it might be undesirable, bywithdrawing British troops, to leave the French with a free hand inthat part of the world, and, more particularly, to allow Frenchinfluence to predominate on the Danube. Unless the British flagwere shown there, the people on the spot would infer that we had abandoned our interests there.The War Cabinet decided that The Chief of the Imperial General Staff should telegraph toGeneral Milne, informing him that the Secretary of Statefor War was shortly going to Paris, and would discuss withM. Clemenceau the question of the employment of Britishtroops in Roumania, and that, in the meantime, general milne should delay sending the 26th Division to thatdestination pending further instructions.(6.) Italy.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff then raised a similarquestion in regard to sending the troops under Lord Cavan&apos;command into Austria. Here again he was of opinion that it wouldnot be wise to send our troops into Austria.The Secretary of State for War said that he too was averse fromscattering our dwindling Army in Roumania and Austria. Hewould prefer our troops to be concentrated on other points where wehad direct interests, such as Turkey, the Caucasus, Baku, and persia.Lord Robert Cecil said that he was opposed to any idea of acrusade against the Bolsheviks. Moreover, he thought that thepeople of this country would strongly dislike it. He mentioned thata conference was to be held at the Foreign Office that afternoon todiscuss the question of our Russian policy, at which the War office would be represented. He suggested that the question of sendingBritish troops under Lord. Cavan into Austria should also bediscussed at the same meeting.The War Cabinet requested Lord Milner and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff toattend the conference at the Foreign Office.and asked Lord Robert Cecil to report to the Cabinet on the following day the result of the deliberations.Post-bellum Army. 2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that he was most anxious to have a ruling from the Cabinet in regard to the size of the post-bellum Army. Definite proposals had been drawn up inthe War Office, which involved Conscription. Unless the wishes of the Cabinet were known there would almost certainly be con-fusion in carrying out the schemes for demobilisation. So far,miners and pivotal men had been ordered to be released, and these
Provision of Foot?to Enemy &apos;Countries.3. The War Cabinet had some discussion regarding theprovision of food to enemy countries.Mr. Chamberlain suggested that, in return for our supplyingfood to Germany and Austria the whole of the German and Austrianmercantile shipping should be placed under the Allied maritime transport Council, and that the organisation of the Food Counciland the Programme Committees should be used for giving effect to whatever policy was adopted in regard to revictualling thosecountries. He was of opinion that it would be a mistake to createany fresh Allied machinery for the purpose, and urged that theexisting bodies should be employed.The War Cabinet considered the question of summoning toEngland German and Austrian delegates who were conversant with the food situation in their countries for the purpose of conferringon the subject.The view was expressed that it would be unwise for Germanand Austrian delegates to be summoned to London at the presentmoment, but that they should be brought to Sheerness or. sometown on the coast, in the first instance, and then it would bedecided whether it was necessary to bring them to London.In connection with the question of German delegates coming toEngland, the First Sea Lord pointed out that a German Admiralwas coming over immediately to discuss naval matters wdth theCommander-in-Chiet&apos; of the Grand Fleet. A signal to this&quot; effecthad been sent to Germany on the previous night, and a satisfactoryreply had been received.The opinion was expressed that we should inform the French,American, and Italian Governments that, inasmuch as the F^oodControl was centred in London, and also the Shipping Control, we proposed to put ourselves in communication with Germany and austria with a view to their sending representatives.The War Cabinet decided that-(a.) Lord Robert Cecil should summon a meeting of the allied maritime Transport Council at an early date, in London,to discuss the utilisation of enemy shipping and theconditions on which relief could be given to enemy countries.(b.) The Food Controller should assemble in London a meetingof the Food Council, consisting of the four Allied FoodControllers, as soon as possible after the arrival ofMr. Hoover.(c.) The Foreign Office should inform the French, American,and Italian Governments that we were proposing to put ourselves in communication with the German and austrian Governments, summoning them to senddelegates to England to be in attendance while theTransport Council and the Food Council were deliberatingon the subject.(d.) The Foreign Office should Isend messages to Germany and austria, asking them to appoint delegates to discuss the would amount to a total of about 170,000. In any case we musthave a voluntary army in time of peace of about 150,000 men togarrison India, Gibraltar, and Malta. He desired the authority ofthe Cabinet to order the Commanders-in-Chief in all theatres to call for volunteers for this purpose.The War Cabinet decided that In the first instance, the Chief of the Imperial General staff should ascertain the effect of the Military Service Acts onthis question, and should bring the matter again beforethe Cabinet.
food question, who should hold themselves in readiness to come to England as soon as they received further notice.Peace Conference. 4. The War Cabinet considered the question of the place wherethe Peace Conference should be held. It was understood that colonel House no longer wished the Conference to he held inSwitzerland. It appeared that there were two suitable places, eitherParis or Brussels. With regard to the latter, Brussels would bethe least convenient, from the point of view of accommodation;it would also be less accessible to the Italians than Paris.Lord Milner pointed out that if the Conference were held inParis we should have the advantage of being able to use our existing staff and organisation at Versailles.The view was expressed that the Secretary of State for Warand the Foreign Secretary, or the Assistant Secretary for ForeignAffairs, should go on the following day to Paris to consult withM. Clemenceau on questions connected with the Peace conference which could not be settled by correspondence.While the Cabinet were discussing these matters a telegram was received from Lord Derby, who had been in communicationwith Colonel House, from which it appeared that, if PresidentWilson decided to come to Europe, he would leave the United Statesof America on the 3rd December, and would be ready for aConference on or about the 16th December. If, on the other hand,the President deoided not to come, Colonel House was prepared to begin negotiations as soon as possible after his colleagues from theUnited States arrived. In these circumstances it would not benecessary for the British Ministers to proceed to Paris on thefollowing day.The War Cabinet decided that Lord Milner and Lord Robert Cecil should proceed to Paris atan early date to discuss the questions in connection withthe Peace Conference with M. Clemenceau.Bank Holiday. 5. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had receivedword that the Minister of Labour desired that Friday and Saturday15th and 16th November, should be proclaimed as Bank Holidays. he proposed to reply to the Minister of Labour that, if his request forthe two Bank Holidays were pressed, it would be necessary first to consult opinion in the City before issrung a proclamation.Lord Curzon&apos;visit to Paris.6. The Prime Minister said he had received a telephone message on the previous evening from Lord Curzon saying that he was anxious to return to London.The War Cabinet approved of a message being sent to lord curzon agreeing with this proposal.Control of jlmports.7. The War Cabinet had before them a recommendation fromthe Economic Defence and Development Committee (PaperE.D.D.C., 15th Minutes, Minute 2) asking for Cabinet approval ofthe proposals in regard to the extension of the existing Inter-Alliedorganisation for the control of imports.The  War  Cabinet  approved  the   recommendation  of   theEconomic Defence and Development Committee.
W(3 501Increased Cattle 8. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum bv the feeding-Stuffs. Food Controller (Paper G.T.-6240) (Appendix I) on the increase of cattle feeding-stuffs.The Food Controller said that there were two proposals forwhich he asked the War Cabinet&apos;s approval. The main fooddifficulties which had to be faced were shortage of dairy produce and shortage of meat, and these difficulties could only be met by increased feeding-staffs supply in the immediate future. Thissupply could only be obtained, under present conditions, by reducingthe milling extraction, and so producing more milling offals, andreverting to a white loaf. He asked permission of the War cabinet for him to give immediate instructions to the flour mills to grindnothing but wheat, and gradually to reduce the milling extractionfrom 80 per cent, to 70 per cent., which would involve an increasein the bread subsidy estimated to amount to about 100,000Z. a week.In reply to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who wished toknow if there were no cheaper way of getting feeding-stuffs thanthat suggested in the memorandum, the Permanent Secretary to theFood Ministry said that, in the vieAv of his Department, it was theonly way. It was essential to get ships now employed in northernlatitudes down to the South American route, in order to enable largeimportations of maize to be made from the Argentine Republic.The only objection to the proposal put forward in the memorandum had been raised by the Board of Agriculture, which stated that the suggested increase of the present price of offals by 45s. per tonwas too high, and would prefer to have this amount reduced to 30s.In reply to an enquiry from Mr. Chamberlain as to whether thepresent proposals involved any breach of faith in respect of theengagements we had made with Mr. Hoover, the Food Controllersaid that the representatives of the Allies had been consulted, andthat they quite recognised that his proposals were necessary in thecase of Great Britain. There was no question, therefore, of any breach of faith. Mr. Clynes, proceeding, said his second point, forwhich he asked the sanction of the Cabinet, was an increase in theprice of malting barley by 3s., viz., from 67s. to 70s. If this conces-sion were not made, sufficient barley would not be forthcoming toenable all the barley grown in this country, other than that requiredfor making suitable provision for the volume of brewing permitted by the Cabinet, to be released for animal feeding. The present pricedid not give sufficient inducement to the home grower to sell to thebrewer.The War Cabinet decided (a.) To approve the proposal to increase the price of maltingbarley from 67s. to 70s.(6.) To approve the proposal to reduce gradually the rate ofmilling extraction from SO per cent, to 70 per cent,(c.) That the suggested increase of the present priee of offalsby 45s. per ton should be reduced to 30s. per ton.At the request of the War Cabinet, the Food Controller under-took to ascertain, and report to the War Cabinet, the extent to whichpresent supplies of feeding stuffs could be supplemented fromBombay, Egypt, and West Africa. So far as Egypt was concerned,,the question had already been considered by his Department.Output of Beer. 9. q;he War Cabinet had under consideration a memorandumby the Food Controller (Paper G.T-6262) (Appendix II) on theoutput of beer. -The Food Controller laid special stress on the undoubtedincreased demand for beer which would be made on demobilisation and the present industrial position. He recommended therefore that the statutory barrelage be increased by 20 per cent, as from
the 1st October, 1918, which would increrse the total bulk barrelagefrom 22,279,000 to 26,050,000 barrels.The President of the Board of Agriculture thought there wouldbe no reasonable objection to this proposal from the temperancepoint of view. By the decision just reached by the War Cabinet(Minute 8) the brewer would not get barley unless he paid the extra 3s., and consequently his profits would be restricted.Lord d&apos;abernon said he had no objection to the Food Con-troller&apos;s proposal to increase the barrelage, so long as there was norise in the present gravity of the beer brewed, and that it shouldnot increase the output of heavy beers.It was pointed out that an important question of policy was involved, and any suggestion to increase the present output of beerrequired most careful consideration, especially having regard to thefact that both the United States of America and Canada were now&quot; dry &quot; countries.After a brief discussion the War Cabinet decided that The Food Controllers memorandum should be referred to the liquor Control Board for immediate attention, the Presi-dent of the Board to notify to the Secretary to the WarCabinet the earliest date on which the question could bebrought up for final decision, if possible on the followingFriday.Food Supply and food Prices for1919.10. The President of the Board of Agriculture said that an urgent matter, requiring an early decision on the part of the WarCabinet, was the question of feetLcappiias-aad prices for the year1919. caajukMThe War Cabinet decided that The Food Controller and the President of the Board ofAgriculture should submit for their consideration at avery early date memoranda examining the question fromtheir respective points of view.Functions of theMinistry ofInformation on&quot;the Cessation ofHostilities.11. The War Cabinet had under consideration a memorandumby Lord Beaverbrook on the subject of the functions of the Ministryof Information on the cessation of hostilities (Paper G.T.-6007).Colonel Buchan explained that the memorandum before theWar Cabinet, which had been written some four weeks ago, urgedthat it would be advisable to keep some sections of the Ministry inexistence during the period between the cessation of hostilitiesand the actual signature of Peace. There were certain functionsof the Ministry which could be at once handed over to different departments, but one of the few duties which it would bedesirable for the Ministry to retain for the present was controlof the Cable and Wireless Departments, by means of whichthe special information required was only obtainable. ColonelBuchan suggested that the Departments should continue to be controlled by the Ministry, at any rate until the Peace conference had finished its work. Colonel Buchan further suggested thatliquidators should be appointed, who should be authorised to windtip the work of the Ministry, with the objects of saving unnecessaryexpense, and of effecting the transference of the various functions ofthe Ministry which could be transferred to other GovernmentDepartments.
7 &apos; WC 501The War Cabinet decided that (a.) Colonel Buchan and Sir Campbell Stuart should beauthorised to close down such work of the Ministry ofInformation as it was clear to them should be closed down, and to negotiate with the various GovernmentDepartments as to transferring to them such functions as it was considered desirable should be retained.(b.) Colonel Buchan and Sir Campbell Stuart should sub-sequently report on the action taken, for the considerationof the War Cabinet.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,November 13, 1918.[1365-501]
APPENDIX I.G.T. 6240. -INCREASE OF CATTLE FEEDING-STUFFS.Memorandum by the Food Controller.THE War Cabinet on the 1st October last (War Cabinet 480, Minute 6) decided, inorder to maintain adequate munitions importation, that food importation into thiscountry in the present cereal year should be on a scale which, while maintaining stocksof human food at a sufficieat level, involved the severest possible rationing of dairyand breeding stock, and made no provision for the cottager&apos;s pig conditions whichCould only be justified by supreme military necessity.For several days past it has been obvious that, with the changed military situation,&apos;such limitation could not be maintained, and as it was the quickest possible measureof relief, I at once gave instructions that arrangements should be made to release for animal feeding all the barley grown in this country which can be spared after makingsuitable provision for the volume of brewing permitted by the Cabinet.In this connection, I should be glad of the sanction of the Cabinet to an increasein the price of malting barley from 67s. to 70s., as I am advised that if this concessionis not made, insufficient barley will be forthcoming for this purpose.The barley release will give some relief, but large further supplies of feeding-stuffswould be required before the agricultural position of the country can be said to beplaced on a satisfactory footing. Animal feeding-stuffs are not available for importationfrom North America in sufficient quantities, and I am accordingly proposing to arrange,through the Inter-Allied Food Council, the Allied Maritime Transport Council, and theMinistry of Shipping, for large importation of maize from the Argentine Republic ;but as the supplies can only be obtained in qurntity by means of shipping which isnow engaged oh the North American route, no relief will be obtained from this sourceuntil March 1919 at the earliest.In my opinion, it would not be right, in the national interest, to endeavour to restrict farm production to a strict war basis for so long a period.The main food difficulties which have to be faced, and which will assume seriousproportions in the near future, are shortage of dairy produce and shortage of meat,and both these difficulties can only be met. by an increased feeding-stuff supply in theimmediate future. The only source from which this supply can be obtained under present conditions is by reducing the milling extraction, and so producing more millingoffals, and reverting to a while loaf. There appears, to be no danger, from the point ofview of supply, in adopting this course, since there are very large stocks of wheat atthe seaboard at North America awaiting shipment; and if, as is likely to be the case,shipment of munitions is severely restricted, there would be large numbers of ships onthe North Atlantic route urgently seeking cargoes. Added to this, the stocks in thiscountry are ample to meet the present needs.I therefore propose, with the sanction of the War Cabinet, to give immediateinstructions to the flour mills to grind nothing but wheat, and gradually to reduce the extraction to 70 per cent. This policy will increase the amount of feeding-stuffsavailable by some 18,000 tons per week.If the offals are sold at present prices, this course would involve the Treasury inan additional loss oh the bread subsidy of some 200,000L per week, but as the quality of offals will be greatly improved, I propose to halve this loss by increasing the presentprice by 21. 5s. per ton, and 1 should also hope to make a substantial profit by the saleof maize as and when it arrives.It is impossible to estimate the exact profits which would be secured in this way,but at present prices it would seem possible that maize would find a ready sale at.21. 10s. or 31. a ton above the cost price, and it should be possible to&apos;secure and sell500,000 tons.While the financial effect of the whole transaction cannot be accurately estimatedat this stage, I urge that the Cabinet should permit the necessary orders to be given atonce, as an enormous gain wiR result to the agricultural situation of the country andto the whole food supply situation.
APPENDIX II.G.T.-6262. -OUTPUT OF BEER.Memorandum by the Food Controller.1. I DESIRE to draw the attention of the War Cabinet to the necessity of arriving at an immediate decision as to the output of beer.2. Under War Cabinet 362, Minute 9, it was decided to retain the present bulkbarrelage of about 22,000,000 barrels per annum, and to reduce the average gravity atwhich the statutory barrelage is brewed to 1,030 degrees in Great Britain and1,045 degrees in Ireland.3. The question of increasing the present allowance of beer was considered by theHome Affairs Committee on 25th September last, and it was decided to adjourn thediscussion in view of the uncertainty as to the available supplies of brewingmaterials.4. In view of the fact that barley is no longer to be used in the manufacture ofGovernment regulation flour, the brewing materials necessary to secure the output of beer at present are now assured.5. Bearing in mind the undoubted increased demand for beer on demobilisation andthe present industrial position, the supply under present conditions is inadequate, and Ithink it imperative to increase the maximum permitted standard barrelage, while maintaining present restrictions as to gravity.6. The increase which I suggest will entail the use during twelve months of anadditional 11,600 tons of brewing sugar, and 414,000 quarters of malt, and involves the importation of 80,000 tons of cereals for this purpose, or a corresponding quantityof cattle feeding-stuffs in the event of the increased quantity of barley being securedfrom the home crop. As an offset 30 per cent, of the increased quantity of cerealsused will be returned for cattle food in the form of maltsters&apos; and brewers&apos; offals.7. I propose further to control the prices of beer for sale in all parts of licensed premises.8. I recommend that the statutory barrelage be increased by 20 per cent, as from 1st October, 1918, viz., from 10,700,000 to 12,840,000 standard barrels, increasing thetotal bulk barrelage from 22,279,000 to 26,050,000 barrels.November 12, 1918.oI therefore ask Cabinet approval 1. To an increase in the prices of malting barley from 67s. to 70s.2. Gradually to reduce the rate of milling extraction from 80 per cent, to 70 percent., involving an increase in the broad subsidy estimated to amount toabout*T00,000Z. a week.J. R. CLYNES.Ministry of Food,November 8, 1918.
