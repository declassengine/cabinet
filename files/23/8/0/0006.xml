IT was suggested that some of the enemy guns recentlycaptured on the Western front by our troops might prove very useful for purposes of advertisement in view of the present War BondsCampaign.The War Cabinet decided -That&quot; the Chief of the Imperial General Staff should take stepsto secure the immediate return of the guns recently capturedon the Western front with a view to their exhibition in thiscountry, if possible, in connection with the present WarBonds Campaign.
Western Front. 2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the WarCabinet that the enemy had, by a counter-attack, driven the americans out of Grand-Pre. The Americans had attempted tore-take it this morning without success. At 5-30 this morning, theBritish, French, and Belgian troops had commenced an attack nearYpres. The attack was apparently progressing successfully, and theAllied troops had already advanced 3 or 4 kilom. According tothe report received just before the meeting of the Cabinet, our forces were now on the outskirts of Menin and had taken the Fort ofBoulers, and were astride of the railway south of that place. Themilitary situation generally was most satisfactory. The French had,during the week-end, recovered a large .amount of ground withoutencountering much opposition.Western Front:Shortage of american Troops.3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that Field-Marshal Haig had recently asked for more American troops, but hadbeen informed by General Weygand that American headquarterswere complaining of a shortage of men. Since the 26th Septemberthey had suffered 35,000 casualties. They had a deficit of y0,000men, and present reinforcements only amounted to 20,000.Polish Army. , 4. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that the french had given the command of the Polish Army to General Halle, whohad a certain number of Polish troops under him in France.Western Front: 5. The First Sea Lord said that our operations in Flanders wereNaval Support. being supported by monitors and light craft operating along theBelgian coast, where they were making numerous feints.Mediterranean.6. The First Sea Lord reported that the French pre-Dreadnoughtbattleship &quot; Voltaire &quot; had been torpedoed, but had managed to get into Milo Harbour.The loss of the&quot; Leinster.&quot;7. The First Sea Lord said that when the &quot; Leinster &quot; had been torpedoed two of our destroyers were in close vicinity. It wasimpossible to provide escorts everywhere, owing to the lack of destroyers and to the great strain upon destroyer personnel. every endeavour was made to make up for this defect by the use of constantpatrols. The daily sailings across the Irish Channel were made by22-knot light-draught vessels which were just as well able to defend themselves as destroyers. As a consequence of the loss of the&quot;Leinster,&quot; the Admiralty had received a telegram from theStewards&apos; Association stating that if the Admiralty would not guarantee to provide regular escorts at once, the members of theAssociation would refuse to sail. In reply to a statement sent tothem by the Admiralty setting forth the limiting factors in the pro-vision of escorts, referred to above, the Stewards&apos; Association had stated that the explanation was not acceptable, and that the question would be raised in Parliament.
Peace and Armistice 8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs stated that aProposals : meeting had been held on the previous day (Sunday) at the PrimeFreedom of the Ministers house at which naval and military representatives wereSeas. present in addition to himself, and discussion took place upon thelatest phases of the situation occasioned by the German reply to president Wilsohs note. The result of this discussion was embodied in two telegrams which had been despatched to our representative atWashington (Nos. 6182 and 6183, dated 13th October).The main object of the British deliberations had been to make itclear that it would be fatal to the interests of the Allies unless thearmistice with the Central Powers was based upon such naval andmilitary conditions as would prevent Germany reopening the war inthe event of a breakdown in the negotiations to be based upon theinterpretation of President Wilson&apos;s Fourteen Points.There were two questions arising out of the Fourteen points which were capable of wide variation in interpretation, namely(1) The Freedom of the Seas, and (2) The Fate of the german colonies.The Germans appeared to think that mere evacuation of theAllied soil occupied by their troops was sufficient to obtain the con-currence of the Allies to begin discussion.Lord Curzon stated that, unless it was quite clear from theterms of the armistice that Germany was defeated, it would be fatal to commence negotiations.Mr. Chamberlain pointed out that the President of the UnitedStates of America would not propose an armistice to the Allies untilthe enemy had consented to evacuation. This made it quite clear tothe German Government that actual terms of armistice had not yetbeen considered, and that the undertaking to evacuate Alliedterritory was only a-condition precedent to the consideration of theterms of an armistice.Lord Bobert Cecil added, that in President Wilson&apos;s note theAllies were not bound to give an armistice even if the enemy hadevacuated or had agreed to evacuate Allied territory.Lord Reading thought that the President was not in any diffi-culty, and that the hypothesis put forward by him to the GermanGovernment amounted to the condition that if the German Govern-ment agreed to his terms he would then consult the Allies.Attention was drawn to the comments which had appeared uponthe situation in the London press that morning.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs stated that it was most unfortunate that, owing to the attitude adopted by the Frenchand Italian Ministers in objecting to publication of the telegram sent to President Wilson from Paris (No. 1229), we were debarred from giving a lead to the British public.The Prime Minister stated that both M. Clemenceau and SignorOrlando had been most anxious that no public statement should bemade, even in Parliament.Mr. Bonar Law stated that, in the event of Mr. Asquith asking him the question in the House of Commons, he would reply that itwould be impossible to make any statement upon the situationwithout consultation with the Allies.In this connection it was suggested that the circumstances should be cow.iixm.ri \ cm ted confidentially to Mr. Asquith.Lord Robert Cecil stated that the French and Italian ministers had taken this firm attitude with regard to our silence concerningthe situation, because they felt that it would be extremely difficultto make any statement without appearing to make a reflection uponthe wisdom of President Wilson.Mr. Balfour stated that the French attitude was quite clearupon the question of the armistice, namely, that the mere evacua-tion of Allied territory was quite insufficient, and that they took theview that the German armies must retire at least to the Rhine.Lord Reading stated that he was very much concerned regard-ing the interpretation placed by the American Government upon
the phrase &quot; The Freedom of the Seas,&quot; and he would like guidance as to the interpretation placed upon it by the British government before returning to Washington.Mr. Balfour stated that he understood that the Admiralty were,preparing a memorandum upon this subject.Mr. Chamberlain thought that the Foreign Office should alsobe asked to draft a memorandum on this subject in detail, and alsothat we should lose no* time in informing the President of theUnited States of America that we could not accept the Germaninterpretation of the phrase &quot;The Freedom of the Seas.&quot;Mr. Balfour stated that, in regard to the German colonies, wewere bound to see that German South-West Africa reverted to theUnion of South Africa, and the case of the German colonies in the pacific to the Australasian Dominions.The Prime Minister asked General Smuts whether it would bepossible to summon a small Indaba of Native Chiefs in the ex-German colonies in Africa, which could be put in as evidence atthe Peace Conference, with regard to the wishes of the nativeinhabitants.General Smuts replied that evidence in this respect had alreadybeen compiled, which was of a most complete character, against theidea that any of these colonies should be returned to Germany.Lord Robert Cecil stated that, while undoubtedly a great case hadbeen made out against the return of the colonies to Germany, itwas not so easy to make out the case for our keeping them.On this point, Lord Reading received during the meeting atelegram from a confidential source in America, stating that hisinformant had seen President Wilson, who was pleased with thesituation, and was happy over the explanation given in regard towhat had happened at Versailles, indicating the probability that aperson in the confidence of the President might start shortly for europe. In view of this telegram, Lord Reading presumed that hewould remain in England until he had seen the American represen-tative.The Prime Minister asked whether it was considered worthwhile suggesting to the American Government that they should send officers to the ex-German colonies with the view to PresidentWilson being informed directly concernipg them.Mr. Balfour thought that such a course might be desirable ifthey could ensure the selection of officers who were both impartialand competent.   This would not be easy.The telegram just received by Lord Beading made reference toa telegram that had been despatched by Sir Eric Geddes to thePrime Minister, and in view of the fact that neither this nor any communication from the President had yet been received, the WarCabinet decided To adjourn the discussion.Future Government 9. The War Cabinet had before them a copy of a letter fromEast10 ^&quot;^e Lord Robert Cecil to M. Pichon, covering a memorandum on thesubject of the future government in the Middle East (Paper G.T.-5.955) (Appendix).Lord Robert Cecil stated that during his recent visit to Parishe had been approached by M. Pichon in regard to this question, andhe had thereupon drafted the memorandum now before the Cabinet.The memorandum had been shown to the Prime Minister, who gaveit his full approval, and it had then been sent to M. Pichon, with a personal letter from Lord Robert explaining that it must be regardedas provisional for the present, as it had not yet received the formalsanction of the War cabinet lord Curzon said that the Eastern Committee had, at a recent
Troops required for 10. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theHome Defence. Chief of the Imperial General Staff (G.T.-5864) recommending areduction in the forces retained for home defence.The War Cabinet approved the recommendations contained inthis memorandum.Parliamentary u   The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that he would askusmess.  or an eariy Cabinet decision on the attitude to be taken up by theGovernment with regard to a Bill for enabling women to sit inParliament.It was decided that The matter should be placed upon the agenda at the next meeting.Lord Bobert Cecil expressed the hope that the Governmentwould press on with the Imports Restriction Bill, which had alreadybeen introduced.The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that he felt this wouldbe impossible unless something was said about the Governmentseconomic policy.Mr. Chamberlain stated that he hoped that the War cabinet would hold an early discussion upon the subject of future economic policy.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,October 14, 1918.meeting, discussed the report of the Anglo-French Conference heldat the Foreign Office on the 30th ultimo, at which an agreement had been drawn up by those present, subject to the confirmation of theBritish and French Governments, in respect of the areas of specialFrench interest as described in the Anglo-French Agreement of 1916,which were, or might be, occupied by the Allied forces of theEgyptian Expeditionary Force. The Eastern Committee hadhesitated to recommend the adoption of the report by the WarCabinet, as its terms seemed to commit His Majesty&apos;s Governmentrather further than the Committee considered advisable withoutcertain guarantees. These guarantees, however, now seemed furnished by the opening passage of the memorandum, which said that HisMajesty&apos;s Government are prepared to accept the arrangementreached at the conference held at the Foreign Office on the30th September upon the under-standing that it is to be treatedsolely as providing for the situation caused by the recent advancesof General Allenby&apos;s force into Syria, and is to be deemed to referonly to the territories occupied, .or to be occupied, by that force ;and, second, by the statement that the agreement of 1916 was, inthe opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government, out of date. In thecircumstances, therefore, Lord Curzon was prepared to recommend the War Cabinet to endorse the memorandum.The War Cabinet decided To approve the terms of Lord Robert cecils memorandum of8th October, 1918.
APPENDIX.G.T.-5955.--Future Government in the Middle East.Copy of Letter from Lord R. Cecil to M. Pichon covering a Draft Memorandum.Dear M. Pichon,In reference to the Affairs of Syria of which you spoke to me to-day, I have greatpleasure in sending you the annexed memorandum, to which the Prime Minister agrees.It has not yet been approved by the Cabinet, and until that has taken place it mustbe treated as to that extent provisional.Yours very sincerely,(Initialled) P. C.Draft Memorandum.British Embassy, Paris, October 8, 1918.His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to accept the arrangement reached at theConference held at the Foreign Office on the 30th September, upon the understandingthat it is to be treated solely as providing for the situation caused by the recentadvance of General Allenby&apos;s force into Syria, and is to be deemed to refer only to the territories occupied, or to be occupied, by that force.With regard to the future government of the other territories mentioned in theAnglo-French Convention of 1916, His Majesty&apos;s Government think it right to pointout that the general position has so much changed since that Agreement was enteredinto that its provisions did not in all respects appear suitable to present conditions.Not only has the military position in Mesopotamia, Palestine, and Syria completelyaltered, but two political changes of vast importance have taken place. The UnitedStates have come into the war, and Russia has gone out. It is manifest on the onehand that America cannot be ignored in any settlement of the future of these countries,and particularly of Syria and Palestine. And on the other, the arrangementscontemplated for the north-eastern part of Armenia have been completely upset by the collapse of Russia. A further difficulty is caused by clause 9 of the Treaty of London,which recognises the claims of Italy in connection with the Eastern Mediterranean. Theprovisional suggestions made at Saint Jean de Maurienne for meeting these claims havelapsed, and, indeed, would in any case be difficult now to enforce without protests from greece, and even from Turkey. While calling attention to these points, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment feel that it would be useless to attempt a settlement of them at the presentmoment, and they suggest that they should form the subject of fresh conversations, inwhich the Governments of Italy and the United States as well as the French andBritish Governments should be invited to take part.(Signed) RORERT CECIL.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,October 12, 1918.o
