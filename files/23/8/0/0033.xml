Demobilisation. 1. WITH reference to War Cabinet 493, Minute 8, the WarCabinet considered the present position of demobilisation.The Prime Minister recalled that some time ago a Committeehad been appointed, with General Smuts as chairman, to co-ordinate* the work of the various Departments concerned with demobilisation.General Smuts had now resigned, and up to the present it had notbeen possible to make satisfactory arrangements for continuinghis work. It was worth considering whether or not it would be preferable to have some one person appointed to act as theco-ordinating centre of the Government^&apos; policy, such a person tohave supreme authority within the limits of certain main principles which would be laid down by the War Cabinet. At present no one person seemed to be in complete touch with the whole problem.He had received strong representations from Departments like theIrish Office and the Scottish Office as to the need for greater co-ordination.Mr. Churchill pointed out that there were serious objections tothe appointment of any one Minister in a position to give orders to other Ministers and Departments. Such a system would tend to weaken Ministerial responsibility. It would be preferable to havea Cabinet Committee of four or five Ministers drawn from theDepartments specially involved in demobilisation, with a chairman.Certain Departments were far more concerned with demobilisationthan others, and this was specially true of the Ministry of Munitions.Under the old system of a large Cabinet the problem would haveheen assigned to a Committee of four or five Ministers. inasmuch as principles of high policy were involved, he should like to see aCabinet Committee of Ministers with political experience, the chair-man of which would report to the Cabinet. Underneath thisCabinet Committee would be a Committee of Experts. He was not sure that the War Cabinet fully appreciated the extent and numberof the decisions already taken. The Ministry of Munitions hadtaken steps to prevent the discharge of workpeople by placing orders, for example, for the manufacture of railway material. TheMinistry of Munitions was the most suitable machinery for the placing of orders, and was waiting to receive such orders from theBoard of Trade and other Departments. It was important to place orders immediately to prevent unemployment, even at the risk ofthe Government later on having to sell some of the material manu-facjtured at a loss.Dr. Addison said that the problem was not merely or mainlyadministrative, but financial. Manufacturers were holding backbecause of the uncertainty as regards prices and the fear of havingpresently to unload their goods on a falling market. Continuousconsultation with the Treasury was essential in the carrying out ofthe reconstruction policy, and some issues raised far-reachingquestions of political principle which could only be decided by theWar Cabinet. The question of rendering financial assistance to manufacturers prepared to work to stock was one of these. nor was it only decisions that were required, but someone was needed tosee that the decisions taken by the Cabinet Committee were beingcarried out expeditiously.The Prime Minister said, with reference to the suggestion ofaiding manufacturers, he wished to be quite certain that there wasno alternative. Was it absolutely impossible that industry shouldbe made to work quickly on natural lines ? If it was not possible,and we were threatened with much unemployment, then some way would have to be found of providing work and avoiding distress. Hewas not sure that a Committee was the most effective method of proceeding, as a very large number of Departments would need to be constantly consulted, but even in the case of a Committee a chairmanwould be required who would have to be free from any heavy depart-mental responsibilities and able to give, for some weeks to come, hiswhole energies to demobilisation.
Sir Stephenson Kent said that, for lack of definite orders forbricks and other materials required for housing, there were something like 10,000 men in the building trade drawing unemploymentbenefit.Mr. Symonds explained that the Housing Department of theLocal Government Board was proceeding as rapidly as possible withthe preparation of orders for the materials required for housing.They proposed to place large orders for bricks, but they weredoubtful about paying the present price, which was from two to three times that of the pre-war period.Mr. Chamberlain thought that the Government would be perfectly safe in giving orders for the total output of all the brick-yards in the country for the next three months at present prices, anda similar policy could safely be followed with regard to certain other articles.(At this stage those present, other than Ministers, withdrew.)Sir Joseph Maclay said that, in his opinion, far greater progress could be made with the Governments housing policy if largerresponsibilities were thrown upon the local authorities.Sir A. Stanley said that the Board of Trade were deeplyinterested in the problems of demobilisation, and very anxious that decisions should be immediately forthcoming, as the trade of thecountry was suffering from the delay.A general discussion then followed with reference to themachinery and personnel for dealing with demobilisation in theimmediate future, in view of the resignation of General Smuts fromthe chairmanship of the Demobilisation Committee.The War Cabinet decided That Departments requiring decisions bearing on demobilisationshould at once formulate the questions to which they require answers, and address them to the Secretary of the demobilisation Committee.2. With reference to War Cabinet 510, Minute 9, the War-Cabinet had before them a Minute by General Smuts (G.T.-6474)recommending the dissolution of the War Priorities Committee, its existence being no longer necessary.The War Cabinet gave their approval to this recommendation.War Gratuities to 3. Xhe War Cabinet had before them an Admiralty MemorandumJjJjr Army&apos; ejld      by Dr. Macnamara (Paper G.T.-6419), and a Note by the Secretary&quot;l &apos; &apos;e&apos; of State for War on the Admiralty Memorandum (Paper G.T.-6455J,in regard to the Wax Gratuities to Naval, Army, and Air force officers and men, and the question of Naval Prize.In the Admiralty Memorandum it was pointed out that theAdmiralty had consistently resisted the suggestion that gratuityhad anything whatever to do with prize. When announcing thegratuities to the non-commissioned officers and men of the Armv andAir Force on the 20th November, the Leader of the House had added &quot; A further announcement will be made with regard .to theRoyal Navy, as well as to the gratuity to be paid to the regular officers of the Royal Navy and the Army.&quot;The War Cabinet Committee on Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Pay had adopted a scale of gratuities for the lower deck of the navy, corre-sponding to that announced by the Leader of the House on the20th November. 1918, for the Army and Air Force. But it was the contention of the War Office, supported by the Treasury and the[1365-512] B war priorities committee
Air Ministry, that as regards not only the scales for the men, butthe scales for officers, temporary and permanent, in the case of thenavy throughout, regard must be had to the fact that the navy hadthe prospect of prize money. The Admiralty contended that anyattempt to tamper with prize in any way would not only cause the greatest possible bad feeling in the fleet, but would cause no less indignation in the country, whose sense of the dominatinginfluence exercised by the fleet in this war was perfectly clear and pronounced. The War Office proposition was that if the navywere to get a gratuity similar to that announced by the leader of the House for the army, the amount of that gratuity must beabated by the amount of the prize money received. The answerwhich Mr. Bonar Law had given implied and it was clearly theintention of the War Cabinet Committee at that moment that thenavy gratuity should be the same as the army without abatementin respect of prize money. The emphatic view of the admiralty was that prize money must stand by itself as the unique perquisiteof the navy gained by their efforts at sea. The amount of prizemoney to those who would get it would probably be at least 51. and might be more to the able seaman, up to 2,000L or more tothe Commander-in-chief of the Grand Fleet. It certainly would notbe paid for the next twelve months.In the memorandum by the Secretary of State for War it was stated that the Admiralty Memorandum did not state the WarOffice position correctly. It was not proposed to do anything which would interfere with the Royal Proclamation of August1918 promising prize to the navy, or to lay down that the navy should derive no benefit, as compared with the army, from theprize fund; but it was contended that, in awarding war gratuityto the navy and army, the Crown might properly take intoconsideration its grant of prize to the navy, and should be advised to do so. It was suggested that the sailor should be given, in thefirst instance, a sum equal to army gratuity. When the prizeaccounts had been worked out (twelve months hence) he shouldbe given such further sum as would bring his total to prize plus a fixed fraction of gratuity (only this fixed fraction being chargedagainst votes of Parliament), Before deciding what the fractionshould be, the discrepancy in the figures should be cleared up andthe value of the prize share roughly determined. It was stated thatthe War Office member of the Cabinet Committee on Soldiers&apos;and Sailors&apos; Pay had never accepted the Admiralty view. Therewas no precedent for giving the whole navy the army gratuity inaddition to prize as was now claimed.In the discussion that took place on the questions raised in thetwo memoranda divergent views were expressed. On the one hand it was argued that the soldiers and sailors ought to be treated alikeas regards reward ; it was urged that if sailors were to receive thesame gratuity as soldiers now as well as their share of prize moneytwelve months hence, soldiers would not be treated fairly. This, itwas contended, would lead to a demand for an increased gratuity tobring the total reward to the army up to the same level as thatgranted to the navy.   This demand might be difficult to resist.On the other hand, it was contended that while loot had been abolished prize money had not been abolished, although the methodof paying had been&apos;changed. The navy was a great historic service with tremendous traditions, and it would be a very serious matter tobreak those traditions at the last moment of the war, when thewhole naval service was counting on receiving prize money inaccordance with an announcement made early in the war, at thetime when the system of pooling prize money was substituted forthe old plan of dividing it up among- the ship&apos;s company of the vesselthat made the capture. In these circumstances it would almostamount to a breach of faith to deprive the navy of prize money.
5wc 512   i y 9The majority of opinion of those present was in favour of thelatter course, and in these circumstances the War Cabinet decided That the gratuities to he given to sailors and soldiers should bethe same, and that in addition the sailors should receiveprize money, which should stand by itself as the uniqueperquisite of the navy.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,December 17, 1918.o
