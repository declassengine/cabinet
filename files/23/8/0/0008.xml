The western front.1. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that there wasno information beyond that contained in the morning&apos;s telegrams,which had been circulated.Allied and Enemy 2. The Chief of the Imperial General   Staff   said   that   the divisions. Germans had only two fresh divisions in reserve on the whole front,but, so far, it had not been possible to locate either of them, andthere was a possibility that these twro divisions had been disbandedfor draft-finding purposes. The Germans bad disbanded twentydivisions in all, leaving them with a total of 185, and, in addition,there were eight Austrian divisions. General Wilson was not certainas to the exact number of Allied divisions, but the French nowclaimed to have 102, we possessed a nominal 01, the United States 38,of which 29 were trained, Belgium 6, and Italy 2. In answer to aquestion as to whether the reduction of the German forces in finland, the Ukraine, and elsewhere, would make any appreciablechange in the situation on the Western front, the Chief of theImperial General Staff said that the Germans had already reduced their forces in these places to a very great extent, and he did notthink that a further depletion would affect the situation in France.The General 3. The  Chief of the   Imperial General Staff then  gave   anSituation. appreciation of the present military situation on. the Western front.The French army, he said, was extremely fatigued, and the british army was very tired, both armies needing rest, whilst the american army was hampered in its mobility by the inexperience of its staff.The Germans, on the other hand, were the most fatigued of all the armies fighting on the Western front. In these conditions, and withthe imminent approach of the mud rendering further movement verydifficult, it was not easy to forecast what results it would be possiblefor the Allies to achieve before the approaching end of thefighting season. In reply to the Chancellor of the Exchequer,General Wilson said that it was a legitimate deduction from his remarks that there was nothing to warrant the assumption that thepresent military situation justified the Germans in giving in. in answer to a question as to what would be the position if no decisiveresult was obtained in the next three weeks, the Chief of theImperial General Staff said that the enemy would, in the north,probably take up his position behind the Scheldt to Valenciennes,with his right on Ghent, and that south of Valenciennes the enemy would have to remain on the uplands as far as the Aisne. - TheChief of the Imperial General Staff gave a sketch of the forthcomingmilitary operations in the Western theatre.Flanders. 4. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that we were doing well in Flanders, and were now three kilometres north-east of Courtrai, and that if we succeeded in capturing the hill justnorth-west of Thourout, Ostend, Bruges, and the railway between those two places would come under the lire of our guns. BetweemtheLys and the Scarpe the enemy was retiring slowly. Further to thesoitth the French were following up the enemy whenever he retired.Palestine. 5. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that GeneralAllen by had reached Horns, 120 miles from Aleppo.Mesopotamia. 6. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that general marshall was going to push on towards Mosul.
Bulgaria. 7. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff then gave the corn-position of General Milne&apos;s force in Bulgaria, and also outlined tothe War Cabinet the readjustments of forces that were taking place between the various Eastern and Mediterranean theatres of war.The ltali.au Front: 8. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the WarLord Cavan&apos;s Cabinet that Lord Cavan had now been given the command of an-Command. army on  the Italian, front.    This position gave Lord Cavan theadvantage of direct access to  General   Diaz,  which  he had notpossessed when commanding a corps.Steamship 9. The Director of Naval Intelligence stated that the steamship&quot;Dundalk.&quot; &quot; Dundalk&quot; was torpedoed and sunk 5 miles N.N.W. of the Skerrieson the evening of the 14th October.    Seven survivors had been landed at Hoi yh end.Loss of a British 10. The Director of Naval Intelligence reported that the BritishSubmarine. submarine  &quot;J 6,&quot; had  been  sunk  by the special service  vessel&quot; Cymric,&quot; 38 miles from Coquet Island, one officer and fifteen men being drowned. The Director of Naval Intelligence said that thisunfortunate accident might have been due to the failure of thespecial service vessel to observe the recognition signal of oursubmarine.    A special enquiry had been ordered.East Africa.11. The War Cabinet approved of the recommendations of theChief of the Imperial General Staff, as contained in Paper G.T.-5960,with regard to the reduction of the command and force nowconducting the East African campaign.GallipoliDecorations.12. With reference to War Cabinet 476, Minute 13, the WarCabinet had before them the Report of the Committee appointed by war Cabinet 473, Minute 10, to consider all the problems involvedin granting decorations for operations during the War, on the. question of the issue of a decoration in connection with the operations in Gallipoli (Appendix).General Seely said that he thought the recommendations of theCommittee indicated the only possible way out of the difficult situation which had been created. General Seely now asked theWar Cabinet to agree to the Report, in order that the Secretary ofState for the Colonies might telegraph to the Dominions for theirassent to the proposals. In reply to a question, General Seely saidthat the Army Council had concurred in the principles of theReport.The War Cabinet agreed to the recommendations of GeneralSeely&apos;s Committee, and congratulated him on arriving at asolution of a very difficult problem, which promised tosatisfy all concerned. They asked General Seely to arrange with the War Office that any announcement of this decision,in Parliament or elsewhere, should be withheld until theSecretary of State for the Colonies had been able toascertain whether it was acceptable to the Dominions.Allied maritime transport Council.13. With reference to War Cabinet 473, Minute 12, the WarCabinet approved the decisions of the fourth session of the allied maritime Transport Council held on the 30th September, 1st and2nd October, 1918 (Paper G.T.-5932).
Transport of 14. &quot;With   reference  to   War  Cabinet  459,  Minute   8,  Lord.American Troops. Reading said that, as requested by the War Cabinet, he had, in collaboration with the Shipping Controller, fully examined theproblem of providing transport for the conveyance of american divisions, or their equivalent, and their enquiries had eventuallyculminated in the arrangement which had been concluded at theFourth Session of the Allied Maritime Transport Council, bywhich 500,000 tons of shipping had been allocated for the Americanarm)&apos; programme for October, November, and December this tonnage being inclusive of 200,000 tons already arranged (paper g.T.-5932, Section 12).The War Cabinet took note of the decision of the allied maritime Transport Council, which completed lord reading&apos;s investigation.The ShippingProblem.15. Lord Robert Cecil intimated that he was circulating to theWar Cabinet a statement of the shipping problem, covering amemorandum by the Allied Maritime Transport Council (paper g.T.-5988).. The Minister of Shipping and he were agreed that theshipping situation, so far from improving, was becoming worse, andthat some public declaration, calling for the strictest economy, wasnecessary. The transport of American troops more than off-set theadvantage from increased shipbuilding. In issuing any public announcement, its reaction on the international situation, andparticularly the encouragement it might give to the enemy at thepresent critical juncture, had to be borne in mind.The War Cabinet instructed--The Secretary to place the subject on the Agenda for the.following day.Representation ofthe People Act,1918.16. With reference to War Cabinet 482, Minute 9, the War-Cabinet had under consideration a memorandum by the President ofthe Local Government Board in connection with the dates of thesecond register (Paper G.T.-5943).    -The President of the Local Government Board explained that,under the Act, the normal Spring register, which relates to a qualifying period of six months ending on the 15th January, wouldbe due to come into force on the 15th April, and that theAutumn register, which relates to a qualifying period of six month sending on the I 5th July, would come into force on the 15th October.The only change which was proposed in the memorandum whichhad been submitted by him was that the second register should come into operation on the 15th May, 1919, instead of 15th April,1919. If approval were given to this proposal, the result would bethat a far better register would be possible than if it were decided not to depart from the Act under which the register would normallycome into force on the 15th April. Mr. Ha\es Fisher explainedthat the difficulties at present experienced with regard to printing,shortage of staff, shortage of paper. &amp;c, were enormous, and thatparts of the first register were not even, published yet. The onlydifficulty which might ensue, if this proposed change were adopted,would be that, if a General Election occurred between the 15th april and the 15th May, next year, such an Election would take place onthe first register instead of on the second.It was generally agreed that, while on general grounds it wasinadvisable to depart from the dates laid clown in the Representation,of the People Act, 1918, it was desirable that the second registershould be as complete as possible.Mr. Hayes Fisher said that the Secretary for Scotland fullyconcurred in the proposals which&apos; he was submitting, and that
Eestoration of Pre- 17. With reference to War Cabinet 482, Minute 13, the war war Practices Bill.   Cabinet had before them the following documents : Draft Bill, with covering letter by the Minister of Munitions(Paper G.T.-5617).Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade (paper g.T.-5957).Note by Lord Weir (Paper G.T.-5974).Memorandum by Dr. Addison (Paper G.T.-5992).The Minister of Reconstruction said that the Government had given pledges on numerous occasions which they were morally boundto make good. He was not specially enamoured of the Bill whichhad been prepared, but he was in favour of some such Bill, and theneed for the Bill was becoming increasingly urgent. The Govern-ment might, at any moment, find themselves concluding an armistice, and difficulties would immediately arise with the TradeUnions. They would insist they had agreed to dilution for war-work only, and would refuse to work on material which was intended for use in the reconstruction period. In his view the Draft Billshould he discussed with representatives of the employers and theTrade Unions, and a definite undertaking should be given inadvance that the Government fully intended to redeem its pledgesby Act of Parliament. On the basis of such an undertaking hethough it might be possible to secure some compromise during thearmistice period. The employers themselves were anxious thatsome understanding should be come to with the Trade Unions, asthey were held up in discussing post-war conditions of production by the unredeemed pledges.The Minister of Labour agreed that the employers were equallykeen with the men to obtain a Bill, and in his view a Bill was absolutely indispensable, and he had recently pledged himself to adeputation from the Trade Union Congress to do his utmost tosecure the passage of such a Bill. Wherever he went he found theGovernments delay in this matter to be one of the most activecauses of industrial unrest, and further delay would tend to rallythe reasonable elements among the workmen to the support ofextremists. The exact terms of the Bill might require furtherconsideration, but without a Bill there could be no negotiationswith the Trade Unions.The Minister of Munitions did not think there was any great orwidespread pressure on behalf of a Bill. He had within the last fewdays met with no opposition when he had explained to bodies of workmen that it was impossible to redeem the Governments pledges.The War Cabinet was being asked to approve a Bill which wasabsurd and vicious. It was a Bill to entrench a number of smalland close corporations in restraint of trade, and would probably meet with the resistance of the great majority of the unskilled and women workers. When hostilities ceased, the State would be faced withthe enormous task of bringing the armies home and of transferring the labour of women, and during that period the Government mustretain control of industrial conditions. He should like to see anattempt made by the Government to come to terms with Labour fora reconstruction period of, say, two years, during which special conditons of control would be in force.   This might be done by a[1365-487] , CIreland was not affected, as there was only one register a year inthat country.The War Cabinet decided that The second register under the Representation of the PeopleAct, 1918, should come into operation on May 15, 1919,instead of April 15, 1919, as laid down in the Act.
National Conference, at which problems of wages and conditions ofproduction might be examined, and a charter for Labour drawn up.If such a charter were secured and given a trial, he was satisfiedthat the resulting material prosperity during the transition period would be so great that there would not be the slighest desire on thepart of anyone to revert to pre-war conditions. If it were decidedto proceed with the Bill, it should be put in charge of Ministers whobelieved in it. He himself did not, but the officers of his Depart-ment would give every possible help in advancing the Bill if it were decided to proceed with it.The Secretary of State for Air said that he spoke withoutpolitical experience, and was only concerned with safeguarding the national interest. Whatever procedure was adopted, thedominating issue should be to preserve the great progress inproductive methods brought about by the war. He agreed withMr. Churchill that an effort should be made to persuade labour to take a larger view, both of their opportunities and their respon-sibilities. In the negotiations which had already taken place it waspossible that the issues had been too narrowly defined and had been restricted to the fulfilment of pledges. He would prefer that theGovernment should meet Labour quite frankly and openly, andshould explain the Governments concern to encourage industrial conditions in the future which would provide large production,abundant employment, and a decent level of life for the workers.Sir David Shackleton said that the Munitions of War Acts didin some measure meet the case of the Trade Unions, but they didnot cover the period from the Treasury agreemenb to the date of theBill, nor did they provide for the agreements which had been con-cluded outside the munitions industries. There were three groups of workmen, whose attitude varied : the extremists, who would bedelighted if no Bill were forthcoming, and who could then point tothe Government repudiation of solemn pledges; a second group,consisting of Trade Unions who had been reluctant to give up pre-warpractices; and a third group, who had met the Government fairlygenerously. If Mr. Churchill&apos;s advice were taken, the Governmentwould be giving the best treatment to those who had helped themleast. The promises of the Government were clear and definite, andshould be fulfilled. That was the view taken by the employers, andwas the unanimous view of the members of Mr. Justice McCardie&apos;sCommittee. With regard to post-war conditions, representativeemployers had assured him that they wished to deal with the work-men themselves, with a minimum of Government interference or regulation. It was true that the workmen wanted the Bill in order-to use it as a bargaining instrument ; but he did not think theirattitude to improvements would be unreasonable, as was shown by a recent declaration by the General Secretary of the Boilermakers&apos;Society with reference to the use of pneumatic tools. That declara-tion was typical of the line which would be taken by the TradeUnion leaders. The Bill had been prepared by an interdepartmental conference, and he supported it. In reply to a suggestion, Sir Davidthought it would be useful to obtain the view taken of it by somerepresentative employers. In any case, before introducing the Bill,an effort should be made to secure general support for it.Sir Albert Stanley said that he thought the form of the present bill left much to be desired, but he was of opinion that it would benecessary to introduce some Bill in order to placate the trade unionists.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) In the absence of the Prime Minister, -no decision should betaken on the question of policy involved, or on the merits of the Draft Bill.(6.) In the meantime, as a preliminary step and without prejudice to the final decision, the Minister of Labour should
ascertain privately the view taken of the Draft Bill bythe three employers who were members of Mr. JusticeMcCardie&apos;s Committee. No action in this matter to betaken until the Secretary of the War Cabinet had obtained the Prime Ministers approval.Profits in Relation 1 8. The War Cabinet had under consideration a memorandum to Cost of Living:     by the president of the Board of Trade with reference to a proposedProposed Enquiry.    enquiry in regard to profits in relation to the cost of living (paper g.T.-5920). J &apos;The War Cabinet approved the recommendations contained in thememorandum, subject to the concurrence of the Minister ofFood.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,October 16, 1918.
APPENDIXReport of Committee Appointed to Consider all the Problems Involved in GrantingDecorations for Operations during the War on the Question of the Issue of aDecoration in Connection with the Operations in Gallipoli.Major-General Right Hon. J. E. B. Seely, C.B., C.M.G., D.S.O., M.P. (deputy minister of Munitions) (Chairman).Rear-Admiral A. F. Everett, C.B. (Naval Secretary to the First Lord of theAdmiralty).Sir Oswyn A. R. Murray, K.C.B. (Permanent Secretary to the Admiralty).Sir Reginald H. Brade, K.C.B. (Secretary of the War Office).The Right Hon. Sir F. Ponsonby, K.C.B.Lieutenant-General Sir H. V. Cox, K.C.M.G., C.B., C.S.I.Brigadier-General W. W. Warner, C.B. (The Director of Air Personal Services,Air Ministry).Brevet Colonel C. H. Frith.1. The Committee was appointed by the War Cabinet in consequence of the strong-objections raised not only by members of Parliament and the press, but also by theDominion troops themselves, to the issue of any decoration to Dominion troops whichwould not also be conferred on their British comrades who shared the same dangers andhardships in the same theatre of war.2. The Committee considered fully various alternative proposals, in particular, thesuggestion that a special decoration should be granted for the operations in Gallipoli.They came to the conclusion that it was impossible to grant a separate decoration forany particular operation without creating anomalies even more serious than those which exist at present. The Committee, however, understand from the War office representatives that clasps for particular operations to be granted on the war m edwill include a clasp for Gallipoli.3. The Committee recommend  ,(1.) That the 1914 Star, in its present form, should be granted under the conditionsnow approved as defined in Army Order 350 of 1917.(2.) That the  1914 Star, with the same  riband, but bearing an altered date- 1914-15, should be extended to all those ineligible for the 1914 Star whoserved in the campaign in a theatre of war prior to 5th August, 1915, andthat it should be granted to all those who arrived in such theatre of war on duty and with proper authority prior to that date.(3.) That the term &quot; theatre of war&apos;&apos; should be defined by the Army Council, inconsultation with the Admiralty and Air Board, thus including, amongstothers : (a.) All the Australian and New Zealand troops who fought in Gallipoli,as well as all the British and Indian troops who were on the peninsula, with very few exceptions.(6.) The 1st Canadian Division, the Canadian Cavalry Brigade, and theearly reinforcements of both, who fought at the second battle of ypres, and at the battle of Festubert.(c.) All those who fought in German South-West Africa, and nearly all the Indian troops who fought in East Africa.(d.) All the British, Dominion, and Indian troops who fought in thedefence of Egypt.(e.) All officers and other ratings of the Royal Navy and the royal marines who served on a ship at sea during the first year ofthe war.(/.) All members of the Flying Services fulfilling the prescribedconditions. Seeing that during the period referred to theR.A.F. was divided between the Naval and Military wings,
allocations to officers and men of each wing should be made, onthe recommendation of the Air Board, on the same basis as is recommended above for officers and men of the Navy and Armyrespectively.4. In making the recommendations above, the Committee have fully realised thoobjections to anv extension of the grant of the 1914 Star, not only in the interests ofthe present holders, but also because of the probability of demands for furtherextensions. But, in view of the fact that the decoration has already been given to nearly 400,000 persons, many of whom had not seen service in the fighting line, theyconsider that its extension to include those who fought in the operations atGallipoli. and in the second battle of Ypres, cannot be held to detract from the distinction which it carries. Under the circumstances, after full consideration of thevarious alternatives (which are dealt with in an Appendix), the Committee are ofopinion that the solution they recommend is the best one.5. The recommendations of the Committee can only be adopted with the concur-rence of the Dominion Governments. The Committee hope this concurrence may besecured, since they are confident that the grant of one decoration to all those whoshared the same dangers and hardships will be more acceptable to the troops than anydistinctive decoration confined to men of one Dominion.Appendix.The considerations which led the Committee to put forward the recommendations contained in their report were as follows : Existing Situation.The 1914 Star is now granted to all officers, N.C.O.&apos;s, and men borne on theestablishment of a unit of the British Expeditionary Forces who served in Francebetween the 5th August, 1914, and midnight of 22/23 November, 1914. Theseconditions, as defined in Army Order 350 of 1917, exclude practically the whole of theDominion forces, who came forward voluntarily at the beginning of the war, and took part in important operations at an early stage of the war, notably the first landing onthe Gallipoli Peninsula. The objections to this arrangement were represented at theConference of Prime Ministers in 1917, and it was agreed that each of the Dominionsmight issue a decoration to their own troops with the full assent of the ImperialGovernment.The objections to this proposal, involving the issue of separate decorations to dominion troops for particular campaigns for which the British troops engaged receivednone, have hitherto prevented any action being taken.It was to recommend a solution to this situation, having due regard to the claims of the Dominion forces and the present holders of the 1914 Star, that this Committeehas been formed.Proposals Considered.1. The first proposal considered by the Committee was to issue a separatedecoration for the Gallipoli campaign, which should be common to all the troops,British, Dominion, and Indian, who took part in the campaign. After full considerationthey came to the conclusion that it would be impossible to authorise a special decorationto the Australian and other troops who served in Gallipoli and at the same time torefuse the grant of a similar special decoration to the Canadian and other troops who took part in the battle of Festubert. If separate decorations were granted in each ofthese cases irresistible demands for the issue of an indefinite number of further campaigndecorations would be made on behalf of the troops who served in Mesopotamia, Africa,&amp;c, &amp;c. In short, the difficulty of selecting particular campaigns for the granting of aspecial decoration and the anomalies that would be created by any such selection are so great that this proposal is considered impracticable.2. The second proposal was to encourage the Dominion Governments to issue aspecial Dominion Star to their own troops, a similar decoration being issued by theImperial Government to the Imperial troops who served during the same period.Enquiries were made with a view to obtaining a representative opinion from the
Australian, New Zealand, Canadian, South African, and Newfoundland authorities as towhether they would prefer a special Dominion Star to a decoration which would be heldin common by all troops, British, Indian, and Dominion.It is ascertained that both General Turner and General Smuts had stated mostemphatically that they were certain that all the Canadian and South African troops would far rather have a decoration which could be shared by the British and indian troops who served with them. On this point they were most insistent, both saying that many officers and men would prefer to have no decoration at ail than to have one whichwas not also given to their comrades. They also both agreed that the 1914 Starextended to 1915 would in itself be more acceptable than any special Dominiondecoration, and this view is understood to be shared by the Newfoundland troops.As regards the Australians and New Zealanders, from enquiries made, it appearsthat they take the same view, with the one possible exception that they would prefer a Dominion riband to the riband of the 1914 Star.The Committee realises to the full that great objection may be raised to any solution proposed, and that it might, in fact, probably would, be far better not to issueany decoration on the lines of the 1914 Star, owing to the fact that continual extensionsmight be demanded, but after full consideration, they are satisfied that their present proposals contain the only satisfactory solution of the existing situation.Advantages of Proposals.The advantages of these proposals are : 1. That they entirely remove the anomaly of troops serving in the same theatre ofwar, side by side, not receiving the same reward for their services.2. That they give ro nearly all those who first responded to the call of duty adecoration which would be extremely highly prized, and which hitherto has been confinedonly to those who rendered this service in France. To this the Committee attach thegreatest importance.3. That they remove the existing anomaly, by which the 1914 Star is issued tomany thousands of officers and men whose duties kept them at a base in France faraway from the fighting line, whereas those men offered their services at the beginningof the war, and took part in the fighting at Gallipoli or Festubert, are ineligible for anyspecial decoration.4. That the grant, by the King himself, of one decoration to British Dominion and indian troops alike symbolises the unity of the Empire.o
