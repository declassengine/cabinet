THE  Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that therewere indications of a withdrawal of the enemy from Tournai. TheGermans were destroying all the railways, which made our progressmore difficult. We had also been impeded by the rain the last fewdays.The Dardanelles. 2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that he hadreceived a telegram from General Milne to the effect that GeneralFranchet d&apos;Esperey wished to confine the British troops to theoccupation of the Dardanelles only, and that the Bosphorus shouldbe occupied by French troops. The Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff asked the War Cabinet for their instructions on this matter.
The War Cabinet decided that A telegram should be sent to M. Clemenceau, calling his attention to this matter and requesting him to issue orders to the effect that, in addition to occupying the Dardanellesports, the British were to occupy the Bosphorus in con-junction with the French.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff was directed to preparesuch a telegram for the Prime Ministers signature, and toinform General Milne that this telegram was being sent.3. At this point the Prime Minister received a message whichthe German delegates with Marshal Foch had asked might be despatched from the Eiffel Tower.   The message ran as follows : &quot;On Friday morning, at the Allied General Headquarters, theplenipotentiaries received the conditions of the armistice, aswell as the formal demand that they should be accepted orrefused within seventy-two hours, expiring on Mondaymorning, at 11 o&apos;clock (French time). The German pro-posal for an immediate conclusion of a provisional suspension-tion of hostilities was rejected by Marshal Foch. A Germancourier, bearing the text of the conditions of the armistice,has been sent to Spa, no other means of communicationbeing practicable. Please acknowledge the receipt, andsend back the courier, as soon as possible, with your latestinstructions. The sending of fresh delegates is not neces-sary for the moment. (Signed) Erzberger.&quot;The War Cabinet decided that-This communication should be made public.4. With reference to War Cabinet 499, Minute 2, the FirstLord of the Admiralty said that more than half the German fleet was affected by the mutiny, but it was thought that the mutinywas being gradually got under control. It was understood that themutiny had arisen in consequence of orders having been issued for a naval attack, and originated among the stokers of the battleship&quot; Markgraf,&quot; who objected to going to sea, in view of the probablearmistice, to what they considered suicide. The First Lord was ofopinion that the instructions to put to sea were the effort of thenaval wing of the Militarist party to assert their power, and toendeavour to raise the moral of the German fleet.5. The Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff informed the WarCabinet that our four armed ships had arrived at Petrovsk in orderto confer with General Bicharakov.6. The Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff said that delegates ofthe Yugo-Slav Government arrived at Corfu on the 6th November,and, after having seen the clauses of the armistice, of which they hadnot been previously aware, resolved to refer to their Government for instructions and necessary powers before any negotiations took place.Admiral Fremantle added that he was not clear what negotiations were necessary, unless the Yugo-Slavs intended to repudiate thearmistice already arranged with Austria.
Officers of theForces as Membersof Parliament.7. The War Cabinet had a short discussion on the subject ofmembers of the forces becoming candidates for Parliament.Attention was drawn to the fact that the Admiralty, the WarOffice, and the Air Force were already going into this question witha view to defining the position of an officer who became either a candidate for, or a Member of, Parliament, and it was pointed outthat it would be desirable if these three Departments should consulton the matter.The War Cabinet decided that The Admiralty, the War Office, and the Ministry of Air should meet and agree upon a common line of action in regard tothis matter.Gallipoli 8. With reference to War Cabinet 487, Minute 12, the WarDecorations. Cabinet had before them a note by General Seely (Paper G.T.-6221)in regard to the Gallipoli decorations. In his note, General Seelypointed out that telegrams had been received from Australia, NewZealand, South Africa, and Newfoundland, agreeing to the proposals approved by the War Cabinet, except that all but South Africawished to extend the date to the end of 1915. No reply had yetbeen received from Canada, but General Seely understood that therewas little doubt that the reply from Canada would be to the same effect as the others.   He therefore proposed (a.) extending the final date from the 5th August, 1915, to the31st December, 1915.(6.) To provide for the inclusion of the Bismarck Archipelago asa theatre of war.The War Cabinet decided (a.) To apjjrove General Seely&apos;s   proposals, and  to  requestGeneral Seely (i.) To submit the matter for His Majesty&apos;s sanction ;(ii.) To arrange with the Army Council for an announce-ment on the subject in the press at the earliestpossible moment.Ministry of Supply. 9. The War Cabinet had before them the following documents : (a.) Demobilisation of munition  industries, memorandum  byMr. Churchill (Paper G.T.-6041).(o.) Disposal of  surplus stores, report by Mr.  Chamberlain .(Paper G.T.-6204).Mr. Chamberlain, in explaining the points contained in his report, said that there were two alternatives for solving the problemof the disposal of surplus stores : (i.) By using the present machinery of the Government ;(ii.) By the creation of a Ministry of Supply, which was recom-mended by General Smuts&apos; Committee.He urged that the Government should decide immediately thequestion, which was also raised in Mr. churchill&apos;s memorandum(Paper G.T.-6041), whether or not a Ministry of Supply should be created. All the Committees which had studied the subject were infavour of the creation of such a Ministry. If this decision were approved by the Cabinet, it would naturally affect their decision onthe question of the disposal of surplus stores. In that case, thepresent Ministry of Munitions would naturally become the nucleus of the new Ministry of Supply, and, just in proportion as it was able
to organise itself for the purposes of supply, it should take over thework&apos;of disposal.Mr. Chamberlain explained that in advocating an immediate decision in favour of the creation of a Ministry of Supply he did not wish to prejudge the difficult question of the proper relationship between Supply and Design, nor did be contemplate that theMinistry of Supply would necessarily take over all supply -thebuilding of battleships, for instance. In his view the Ministry ofSupply should be developed gradually from the Ministry ofMunitions. The latter would naturally take over first of all these new duties about which there was none or least dispute, and as theprocess proceeded and the position became more clearly defined,Cabinet decisions could be obtained on the more difficult and con-tentious points.General Smuts said that, if the scheme were not adopted, itwould mean the dismantling o f the Ministry of Munitions after the cessation of hostilities. In his opinion, the logical thing was tocreate a Ministry of Supply.Mr. Churchill said that, while the creation of a Ministry ofSupply was, in a sense, not urgent, at the same time it would bedesirable to select, out of the existing enormous staff in the Ministryof Munitions, a large majority of whom would soon have to be released, the most suitable members who would become the nucleus of the new Ministry of Supply.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that the disposalof surplus stores was an urgent matter, and recommended the settingup of a Ministry of Supply. He had been informed, while in Paris,that there was something like 1,000,000,000/. worth of British stuffin France, and therefore the question of the proper disposal of such material was a very big question from the Treasury point of view.Dr. Addison said that he was in complete sympathy with theproposal, although he thought that at the present time there wasno need for the Government to commit themselves as to theparticular commodities for whieh they should make themselvesresponsible. In the disposal of surplus stores, the requirements ofthe Dominions and Local Government needs should be brought tothe cognizance of the Minister in charge.Mr. Montagu said that Lord Haldane&apos;s Committee was going toreport that there should be a Ministry of Supply, that it shouldbe created out of the Ministry of Munitions, and that it wasnot possible for the Committee to define functions. In theory itshould supply everything, in order to prevent competition for labour,capital, material, and the services of particular firms, and also toprevent variations in method and conditions of contract and treat-ment of labour questions. How far the theory could be in factachieved involved considering departmental needs as to control of design, and the Committee were content to leave it with therecommendation that the endeavour should approximate to the theoryas far as practically possible. He did not think the Cabinet need go further than this to-day.Mr. Montagu then made the suggestions which are recorded inthe War Cabinet decision.Sir Eric Geddes also agreed to the setting up of a Ministry ofSupply on the basis of the explanation given by Mr. Chamberlain.He wished to urge three points : first, that the Departments shouldbe responsible for saying what stores were or were not surplus ;secondly, that there should be no change in supply arrangementsuntil peace ; thirdly, that there should be no decision yet as toexactly what commodities should be dealt with by the Ministry ofSupply, as, for instance, the building of war ships; in his opinion and speaking not as First Lord of the Admiralty, but as a minister with a good deal of experience in the Ministry of Munitions hethought that there were a very great many common articles whichcould be -better dealt with by a Ministry of Supply; he instanced
(2.) A scheme for (i.) The scope of a Ministry of Supply ;(ii.) Its functions ;(iii.) Its organisation.   .Anti-Aircraft 10. With reference to War Cabinet 489, Minute 9, the WarDefence of the Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Chief of theUnited Kingdom.     Imperial General Staff (Paper G.T.-6212) regarding the anti-aircraft defence of the United Kingdom.The War Cabinet approved the proposals contained in thememorandum,but requested The Minister of Air to suspend action for three days, pendingthe result of the armistice negotiations.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,November 8, 1918.othe case of wire, and the fact that the Navy, being a large user ofwire, had in this war provided all the barbed wire for France.The War Cabinet decided (a.) To create out of the Ministry of Munitions a Ministry ofSupply ;(b.) To entrust the Ministry of Supply with the sale of surplus war stores;(c.) That the Departments concerned should be responsible forsaying what stores were surplus;(d.) That no change in supply arrangements should be made until the conclusion of peace.They therefore requested -The Ministry of Munitions to submit to the War Cabinet (1.) A scheme for organising and manning a Sub-Departmentof the Ministry for the disposal of surplus war stores;
