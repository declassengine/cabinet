Accommodation ofDemobilisationStaff.1. THE Prime Minister drew attention to the desirability of reducing immediately the amount of accommodation occupied by government Departments, and the need for finding quarters for the demobilisation staff. The First Commissioner of Works had foundthat so far from Ministers surrendering accommodation, they were actually demanding more. In particular, there would seem a strong case for reducing the existing staff in the Ministry of Munitions.There was a considerable amount of feeling on the subject, and ifanother big hotel had to be commandeered for the Demobilisationstaff, it was quite certain that there might be a public outcry.The Prime Minister asked the Minister of Munitions to look into the matter with a view to surrendering part of the accommoda-tion occupied by his Department.Two suggestions had been made in regard to quarters for the demobilisation staff, namely- (a.) That St. Ermine&apos;s Hotel should be evacuated for thepurpose ;(b.) That the huts outside the War Cabinet offices should beused. This latter plan would be the most convenient,having regard to the proximity of the War cabinet offices, the Ministry of Labour, and the Ministry ofMunitions.Mr. Churchill said that it was now only five and a half weekssince the firing had stopped. His first instinct, upon the cessation ofhostilities, had been to prevent unemployment. He had succeeded in arresting waste of raw materials, and there had been, in fact, aconsiderable number of discharges, a large proportion of which hadalready found other employment. The big rush of discharges would,however, take place from the 15th January onward. Then, again,an interruption in work had been caused by the General Election.This was the first time that he had been asked to approach thequestion from the point of view of buildings rather than numbers ofstaff. If the First Commissioner of Works had given him warning,he would have been glad to have brought a report on the subject.The War Cabinet requested The Minister of Munitions and the First Commissioner of works to confer on the question of evacuating&apos; accommodation atpresent occupied by the Ministry of Munitions.Demobilisation.2. With reference to War Cabinet 512, Minute 1, the WarCabinet further considered the question of demobilisation.The Prime Minister said that he had thought it desirable to invite Ministers in any way concerned with demobilisation problems to be present. The War Cabinet had decided that Sir E. Geddesshould be asked to take the post vacated by General Smuts, and,after great reluctance, Sir Eric Geddes had agreed to take up thepost at any rate, until the machinery was in working order. It was important to make perfectly clear what the post was. Sir E. Geddeswould be charged with the co-ordination of the efforts of the Depart-ments dealing with demobilisation, and would represent the WarCabinet and be armed with its authority. No doubt, in the case ofany conflict of principle or large issue of disputed policy, he would bring the matter before the War Cabinet. Subject to that, hewould have the same power as a representative of the Cabinet,would act in conjunction with the Departments, and consult withthem with a view to complete co-ordination. It was very urgentthat the machinery should be working swiftly and smoothly. Therewas an unjustifiable feeling abroad that demobilisation Was proceed-ing very slowly, and there would be complaints from soldiers and sailors, from manufacturers and farmers, if the men were not being released   as  rapidly as possible.     There were   great difficulties
IllWar Priorities 3. With   reference   to   War   Cabinet    512,   Minute   2,   theCommittee. Secretary stated that he had requested the Secretary of the war priorities Committee to demobilise his staff in accordance with theusual Treasury rules, and asked him to consult the Secretary ofSir Eric geddes&apos;s organisation in case he would like to take over anyof the staff thus released. It had also been arranged that alldocuments relating to demobilisation should be handed over to thenew organisation.The War Cabinet gave their approval to these arrangements.medical examination on demobilisation ofMen Serving inthe Army.4. With reference to War Cabinet 510, Minute 4,Mr. Chamberlain stated that, in accordance with the requestof the War Cabinet, he had conferred with the Departmentsinterested in the question of the medical examination, on demobilisa-tion, of men serving in the Army, but in view of the appointmentof Sir Eric Geddes he proposed to transfer the question to him for decision.The War Cabinet approved of Mr. Chauiberlahi&apos;s suggestion.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.December 19, 1918.oinherent in the problem itself, and the utmost the War cabinet could do was to see that there was no delay which could be attributed to lack of understanding and co-ordination.Mr. Churchill said that it was very public-spirited of Sir eric geddes to undertake so difficult and thankless a task. He himselfforesaw some difficulty in the arrangement now proposed, inasmuch asthe Ministry of Munitions was really the natural centre apart fromthe Army of the whole operation of demobilisation, the only machinethat could carry it out, and a machine that was at present function-ing with the utmost smoothness. He should have preferred to seethe machinery required for demobilisation built around the MunitionsCouncil, which could report to a Cabinet Committee through theMinister of Munitions. He feared that to create what looked like anexternal machine would, not give the Minister in charge of it themost effective power. The Ministry of Munitions was concernedwith, perhaps, 80 per cent, of the whole labour problem involved.The Prime Minister agreed that very much might be said infavour of the course recommended by the Minister of Munitions.The Cabinet had, however, come to the conclusion that, on thewhole, there was more to be said in favour of the alternative policy.The Ministry of Munitions would itself be external to the mines,textile, farming, and shipbuilding industries, and, to a large extent,it would be external to the building industry, to railways, roads, andpublic works. Taking the five or six millions of men in the Armyand Navy, he questioned whether the Ministry of Munitions wouldbe concerned with the employment of more than 20 per cent, of that number.The War Cabinet decided (1.) To place Sir Eric Geddes, as representing and with theauthority of the War Cabinet, in charge of theco-ordination of demobilisation and the rehabilitation ofindustry, with full power to take decisions on their behalf, and to summon meetings of the Heads of all departments concerned in this question.(2.) To dissolve the existing Committee on Demobilisation.
