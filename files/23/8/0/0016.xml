21: The Secretary of State for Home Affairs asked the instructions of the War Cabinet in regard to a telegram which had been receivedfrom Versailles, saying that the Prime Minister desired that theterms of the armistice with Turkey should be communicated at once to Parliament.As neither House was sitting on the day on.which the message had been received, the War Cabinet decided that The terms should be at once communicated to the press, throughthe press bureau,and requested the Home Secretary to take the necessary action.2. The Director of Military Intelligence said that on the previous day the Hnd Army, which was attacking in the direction ofAudenarde, had advanced 2 miles on a 5-mile front, capturing 12,000prisoners. Progress was also being made in the outskirts ofValenciennes, where stiff fighting was going on, as the enemy were offering strong resistance.The Italian Front. g. The Director of Military Intelligence reported that on theItalian front four cavalry divisions were advancing from the Livenzato the Tagliainento, and another cavalry division was moving intothe Upper Piave Valley by the Fadalto Pass. The Illrd Army was making progress beyond the Piave, and was operating south ofthe Oderzo Railway. The resistance offered by the enemy inthe passes north of Lake Garda was of a stubborn character.According to the Italian military attache in London, an enemyparlementaire had been received by General Diaz on the previous day, and an armistice had been signed. There was, however, nocorroboration of this report, nor had we tit present any informationas to the nature of the terms.Turkey. 4. The Director of Military Intelligence said that there was nothing to report from the Macedonian front. In accordance withthe instructions of the War Cabinet on the previous day, the termsof the armistice with Turkey had been telegraphed to general allenby, General Milne, and General Marshall. He suggested thatit might have a good effect if the terms were published in generalorders to the troops.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The War Office should instruct General Allenby to publish the terms of the armistice with Turkey in general orders.(6.) The Secretary of State for India should telegraph to theViceroy authority to publish the terms of the armistice.It was agreed that the Dominions and Egypt should be similarlyinformed.Trans-Caucasia. 5   The Director of Military Intelligence said that it appeared,from information received, that some 500 Germans were nowe?i route for Baku. A telegram had been sent to General Marshall sayingthat importance was attached by the War Cabinet to the early re-occupation of Baku, and asking him to forward his appreciation as tothe possibility of doing so from Enzeli.Armistice with turkey :Question of Publi-cation.The &quot;western front.
The Dardanelles. 7. In reply to a question by Mr. Montagu, Admiral Fremantlesaid that we had no further news from the Dardanelles, and hethought it highly improbable that our Fleet had moved up to constantinople.The Coal Situa- 8. With reference to War Cabinet 486, Minute 12,  the Wartion : Cabinet had under consideration a memorandum by the Secretary of release of Miners State for War (Paper G.T.-G098), a letter from the Ministry offrom the Army. National Service to the Secretaries of the Admiralty, the War Office,and the Air Ministry (Paper G.T.-6130), and a memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (Paper G.T.-6147), on the questionof the release of coal-miners from the Navy, the Army, and the AirForce.Lord Curzon said that the main points to be decided were :firstly, the number of miners to be released, and, secondly, whetherall the men asked for must be of categories A and B 1, orwhether an equivalent number of men belonging to lower medicalcategories could be accepted by the Coal Controller.The Coal Controller said that the present position was that the colliery companies could take no more lower category men, and thatthey were asking for A and B 1 men only.   At the present time itwas impossible to employ more men of the lower categories.   Withreference to the statement made in Lord Milner&apos;s memorandum,that  of the   low-category men  already  returned 74 per  cent,were actually working on the face, Sir Guy Calthrop said that,from figures supplied to him, the percentage should really be 38, and explained that this difference apparently arose from the fact that so many men gave their previous occupation as colliers or miners whenthey had really never been actual getters of coal at the face.   Up tothe present the War Office had returned 6,507 A and B 1 men, and14,735 B 2 men.   The Department, therefore, asked for a further26,378 A and B 1 men.   Questioned as to whether it was impossibleto make use of German prisoners in the mines, Sir Guy Calthropreplied that the opposition to this proposal did not come only fromthe miners, but also from the coal owners.   They took the view thatsuch a procedure would be dangerous, as one desperate man might do incalculable damage in a coal mine.   The miners would not work with German prisoners, and to attempt to force them to do so wouldmean further loss of output.   In reply to a statement made by theMinister of National Service that the underground workers in thelast period of -t914 numbered 769,000, whereas the present number was 800,000, Sir Guy Calthrop explained that a large number ofthese men had only just returned to the mines, and that some time must necessarily elapse before they were properly fit to take up theirold work again.   The last two weeks had been the best two weeksas regards output for this-year ; but, even if an output of coal on theaverage of these two weeks was maintained, it would be impossibleto provide the amount of coal required.   Already the coal reserve ofthe railways had reached dangerous limits, and there was not sufficient[1365-495] B 2Submarine Warfare. 6. The Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff reported that a weekago all German and Austrian submarines in the Mediterranean were taking in fuel, and preparing to return to port. There were no indications yet that they had actually started. The Admiralty were taking the necessary measures to deal with them en route. Outsidethe Mediterranean, attacks on merchant shipping had ceased sincethe 24th October.Admiral Fremantle then briefly described the movements of submarines outside the Mediterranean Sea.
coal now available for the household rationing scheme ; consequently,in order that enough coal should be provided for households, whichwas so essential, it would be necessary to take more coal from munitions and industry, which would undoubtedly mean unemploy-ment. The only way to meet this shortage was by bringing backminers of A 1 and B 1 medical categories from the Army, but, inspite of the decision of the War Cabinet, no steps up to the presenthad been taken to do this, and the whole position was at a standstill.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for War said thathe agreed with the numbers quoted by Sir Guy Calthrop to be released from the Army, except for a difference of 200 or 300 men.It was quite impossible for the Army to release men of the categoryrequired at the present time. Lord Milner had explained in his memorandum that the War Office had been in communication withGeneral Headquarters in France in order that miners might be with-drawn from tired divisions, but no answer had yet been received.Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig was not in a position at the presenttime to inform the War Office what divisions he could takepermanently out of the line, and, until he was, it would be impossibleto say the n timber of A men that could be released. Mr. Macphersonexpressed the opinion that this was a question for Field-marshal sir Douglas Haig to decide, but at the same time desired particularly to draw the attention of the War Cabinet to that portion of lord milner&apos;s memorandum in which he warned the War Cabinet, before it finally decided this question, that to call out 32,000 A and B 1men would be infinitely more disastrous to the army than to call outthe equivalent of such men. Lord Milner had said that it wastotally impossible to get as many as 32.000 men without completelydislocating some of the best units in the Army, and, as the Army had had 800,000 casualties already this year, and is still fighting hard,whde recruiting has almost come to an end, and will in any case fail to attain more than half its 1918 strength in 1919, this was a graveconsideration. Mr. Macpherson said that if the military authoritiesin France considered the military situation such that it waspossible to release miners from units at home which now providedreinforcements for France, these men could be quickly transferred tothe Reserve, but at the present moment they were the only reinforce-ments available for units abroad.The opinion was expressed that, in the absence of the PrimeMinister and the Secretary- of State for War, it was impossible forthe War Cabinet to issue instructions for 32,000 A and B 1 mento be released from the Army. The Prime Minister was undoubtedlyfully aware of the gravity of the coal situation, and of the decision which had been arrived at on the previous occasion when thisquestion was discussed, but no action had been possible in order tocomply with the decision, as it could not be said that there were anydivisions in France which had been withdrawn from active offensive operations, and which would not&apos; be employed again this year foractive operations. In reply to a suggestion that the Coal Controllershould himself go to France in order to see the Prime Minister, lord milner and Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, Sir Guy Calthrop saidthat, while he was quite willing to go, he felt that Mr. Lloyd Georgewas in possession of all the facts of the case, and that, if the WarCabinet would send a telegram giving their views on this question,it Avould be unnecessary for him to go himself.The War Cabinet decided that The President of the Board of Trade should, in consultation withthe Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for War, pre-pare and despatch a telegram to the Prime Minister statingthat the question of the release of miners from the army had been discussed at the War Cabinet that morning, and-asking, in view of the decision of the War Cabinet on thisquestion which was given on the 15th October, 1918, that
he should consult the Secretary of State for War and field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig as to -(a.) Whether it appeared probable that miners of medicalcategories A or B 1 could be released at an earlydate from divisions in France which had been withdrawn from active offensive operations, andwhich would not be employed again this year ;(6.) Whether the military situation allowed, or would allow in the near future, of the transfer to theReserve of miners now in training in GreatBritain.(Initialled.)       C.
