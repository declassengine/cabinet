WITH reference to War Cabinet 478, Minute 1, the war situation:  ^ Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Board of TradeEight Hours Day.    dealing with the demand for an eight hours&apos; day for locomotivedrivers and firemen (Paper G.T.-6386).It was explained that in the negotiations with the Associationof Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, which had taken place inAugust, 1917, between Mr. Barnes and Sir Albert Stanley, acting on behalf of the Government, a promise had been given that thequestion of reducing the hours of labour would be considered bythe War Cabinet on the cessation of hostilities.Sir Herbert Walker said that the present trouble was beingfomented by the Association of Locomotive Engineers and1 Fire-men, who wished to score off the rival union, namely, the NationalUnion of Railwaymen. About half of the enginemen were members of the latter union, and in any negotiations both unions
would have to be dealt with. While it was true that the Govern-ment had promised to consider the question on the cessation ofhostilities, they had not promised to settle it within a few days or weeks of such cessation. He also said that an application foran 8 hours&apos; day had been received on behalf of other railwaymen,and that the question would have to be dealt with as a whole.Mr. Roberts agreed with Sir Herbert Walker that the Govern-ment would have to deal with both unions, and that the problem would have to be considered as a whole.Sir William Marwood said that in the communication which mr. Bromley, of the Association of Locomotive Engineers and firemen, had made to the Board of Trade, he had declared that&quot; either the eight hours must be recognised during the next fewdays or there&apos; must be a trial of strength there was no more room for argument.&quot;The War Cabinet authorised The President of the Board of Trade to inform the repre-sentatives of the unions concerned that the Governmentwould make a statement on the subject next week.The coal situation :Release of Minersfrom the Army.2.

With reference to the preceding Minute and to War Cabinet503, Minute 8, the War Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for War, dealing with the proposedcreation of a new section of the Army Reserve, to be called Class Z,to which all men with certain exceptions, such as men of &quot; W &quot;and &quot; P &quot; Reserves would be passed as they were released(Paper G.T.-6368).Lord Milner, in reply to Mr. Barnes, said that the legal obli-gation to serve in the Army ceased at the termination of the war,and this, he understood, had been defined as meaning the exchangeof the ratifications of peace. It was now proposed that, for the duration of the war, when a man was demobilised he should beput into the Army Reserve, Class Z, so that, if he&apos; were againwanted, he could be called up without recourse to the-tribunals.The War Cabinet decided To approve the proposals of the Army Council as set forth ithe Memorandum of the Secretary of State for War.Use as PollingBooths of Premisesrequired for demobilisation.4.

While Government priority in the use of the premisesshould be retained, every effort should be made by theDepartments concerned to exercise this right with thegreatest possible elasticity and consideration until the
General Election was over. Unless absolutely neces-sary, there should be no fresh interference with build-ings now in use for election purposes, and where pos-sible the Departments should release premises nowoccupied by them.(6.)
