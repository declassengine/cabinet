1. THE Director of Military Operations called the attention ofthe War Cabinet to a telegram from France, dated the 11th Novem-ber, 1918, conveying a message from General Haking, the Head of theBritish Military Mission at Spa, to the effect that Marshal Foch wasbeing asked by General Nudent to send delegates to discuss economic questions with German naval and industrial representatives at Spa.General Haking recommended that a British delegate should besent as soon as possible, qualified to discuss economic questions suchas labour, coal, iron, shipping, and railways.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that we ought notto consider the economic problem of Germany by itself. x\ppealsfor relief were being received from Finland, Murmansk, Sweden,Holland, Switzerland, and Austria. All these appeals, together withthat of: Germany, ought to be regarded as a whole, and treated as one by some Inter-Allied body dealing with questions of food andtransport. If the French sent a commercial delegate, we ought todo the same.Lord Curzon said that there appeared to be two steps required :first, to send a telegram to the French to find out if they were proposing to discuss the question raised in the message sent byGeneral Haking ; and, secondly, if they were willing to send a delegate, we should send an expert on economic matters.In .this connection it was pointed out that whoever was sentwould, presumably, be in a position subordinate to that of GeneralHaking, the Head of the British Military Mission at Spa.The War Cabinet decided that The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should send atelegram to the British Ambassador in Paris in thefollowing sense : &quot; We understand that Germans at Spa are asking for delegates to discuss economic questions connected with occupiedGerman territory.   What view does the French Govern-ment take   of this request, and what   action  do   they propose to take ? &quot;Italy.. 2. The Director of  Military Operations reported that lord cavan had sent one battalion and one Brigadier to Fiume, whichhad already been occupied by the Italians.Economic Relief inGermany.Captured GermanGuns and submarines.3. The Prime Minister referred to the great interest which thepublic had displayed in the exhibition in the Mall of the capturedGerman guns. Fie suggested that this collection of guns ought tobe distributed throughout the leading towns of this country. he also suggested that the captured German submarines, the firstbatch of which was reported by the Deputy First Sea Lord to bedue at Flarwich on the following morning, should be distributedand shown in the Thames, the Mersey, the Tees, the Tyne, and the clyde. These guns and submarines were the outward and visiblesign of victory.Admiral Flope mentioned that this was the intention of theAdmiralty.The Chancellor of the Exchequer added that an exhibition ofthese captured guns and submarines might be used as a means of raising money in connection with the War Bond campaign.The War Cabinet decided that it should be an order to (a.) The Board of Admiralty to make arrangements fordistributing the captured German submarines amongstthe principal seaports in this country.
Treatment of theex-Kaiser ofGermany.4. Lord Curzon asked whether the War Cabinet proposed todiscuss the question of the treatment of the ex-Kaiser of Germany.The War Cabinet decided that This question should be placed on the Agenda of the imperial war Cabinet on the following day, Wednesday, the 20thNovember.Cereal Prices for1919:Crops.5. With reference to War Cabinet 501, Minute 10, the WarCabinet had before them the following Memoranda : Memorandum by the Food Controller (Paper G.T.-6101).Memorandum by the President of the Board of Agriculture aff dFisheries (Paper G.T.-6276).Memorandum by the Food Controller (Paper G.T.-6282).Memorandum by the President of the Local Government Board(Paper G.T.-6312).Mr. Prothero said that the three Boards of Agriculture concurred in asking for sanction to announce that the prices for controlledcereals to be paid to farmers for the harvest of 1919 should benot less than those fixed to be paid to farmers for the harvest of 1918.In the United States, President Wilson had issued a proclamationguaranteeing to farmers that the prices for the 1919 crop should not beless than those guaranteed for the 1918 crop. An assurance to theBritish farmer by the Government was necessary in order to maintain and improve the present level of tillage. Without it there wouldbe a slackening of effort, and land would revert to fallow at thetime when the maximum of employment was desirable. He admitted that under the Corn Production Act certain prices had been fixed,but we were in a transition period. It had been expected, whenpassing the Corn Production Act, that prices would fall with areduction in the cost of production, but the farmers&apos; costs this year were much heavier than last year.Major Waldorf Astor, in the absence of the Food Controller,stated that Mr. Clynes was primarily concerned to safeguard theposition of the consumer. In the past it had been sufficient to fixmaximum prices. The proposal now, however, was that these maxi-mum prices should be guaranteed, and this raised questions of generalagricultural policy, amending the Corn Production Act, which itwas for the War Cabinet rather than the Food Controller to decide.The Food Controller was satisfied that the wheat necessary tofeed our people would be forthcoming from overseas, if required,apart from our home crop.Sir John Beale said the additional quantity of wheat whichwould be obtained as the result of the inducement Mr. Protherowished to offer the farmers would be about 100,000 tons. This wasa comparatively negligible quantity in relation to our total con-sumption. The world&apos;s total requirements of imported wheat wasabout 16,250,000 tons, and (omitting 2,000,000 tons of australian wheat) the supply available for export was about the same. Ourdemand for imported wheat was between 5,000,000 and 6,000,000tons, and our total home consumption was between 6,000,000 and7,000,000 tons. We produce under 2,000,000 tons in this country,,and a matter of 100,000 tons was not of vital importance in peacetime. A guarantee covering next years harvest would involvethe control of food until September 1920.Mr- Prothero, in reply to a question, said his proposal wouldnot put up the price of food, as there would be no immediate(6.) The Army Council to make arrangements for bringing overthe captured guns, and their distribution throughouthe leading cities.
Prisoners of War 6. Lord Curzon asked for the direction of the War Cabinet inDepartment. regard to two questions to be put in the House of Lords that day,asking the Government to institute an enquiry into the adminis-tration of the Prisoners of War Department.Lord Cave said he understood that the Department was chargedwith having done nothing for prisoners until a few months ago. Ifthere were to be any enquiry he should prefer a body of a judicialcharacter, like the Dardanelles Commission, to a Select Committeeof the Houses of Parliament.It was pointed out that much of the current criticism waswrongly directed at the Prisoners of War Department, inasmuch asthe delay in endeavouring to arrange for the exchange of prisoners had been due to the deliberate policy of the War Office a policyreduction in the world price. If anything, the United States price would be higher than ours. Further, it had to be remembered thatthe United States crop might fail, and an extra 100,000 tons wouldthen be very useful.Sir O. Fielding thought that without the Government guarantee the falling off in cultivation might represent a drop of a million tonsof cereals. The farmers&apos; costs in labour, machinery, and fertiliserswere now double the pre-war figures, and, if no assurance as to prices were forthcoming, there would be a great revulsion of feeling amongthe farmers. Fertilisers, for example, which formerly cost 21. 10s.per ton, were now costing 0L, and as to wages, the farmers knewthere would be no chance of obtaining reductions from the wages board until after next years harvest.Mr. Munro said he believed the farmers in Scotland would continue cultivating land for cereal crops at the present level,without the inducement now suggested. They were satisfied thathigh prices in the future were assured, and that labour would bemore plentiful. At the same time, if any pledge were given, itwould have to include Scotland, and it should, Air. Munro thought,be announced in the House of Commons that afternoon.Sir Auckland Geddes said that, from the standpoint of thedevelopment of the Governments housing policy and the absorption of. labour, he hoped the War Cabinet would give the guarantee now asked for.In coming to their decision, the War Cabinet recognised the disadvantage of making an announcement on the eve of the dissolution of Parliament, and at a time when there would be littleopportunity of challenging the Governments policy. On the otherhand, it was realised that the condition of the country, and of theworld generally, was abnormal, and likely to continue so for sometime to come. The claims of the enemy Powers to food had now tobe considered, and transport would have to be found for the conveyance of troops and material overseas. In view of theobligation still resting on the Allies to occupy the former theatres of war in Europe and the East, many of the troops would not returnto civilian pursuits in time for the next sowing season ; and although,as some maintained, prices might come down considerably duringthe next six months, the difference between the market value andthe guaranteed price would probably not be so great as to cost thecountry more than 3,000,000Z, or 4,000,OOOLThe War Cabinet decided that (a.) The prices paid for controlled cereals harvested in 1919should be not less than those now current.(6.) The President of the Board of Agriculture should arrange to announce this decision by means of a parliamentary question that afternoon.
which might he defensible if one were dealing with an enemy withlimited and failing man-power.Lord Curzon undertook to reply that the Government wouldgive the subject their careful consideration.Conscientious 7. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by LordObjectors. Cave on the disposal of conscientious objectors (Paper G.T.-6318).The War Cabinet approved the steps which were at present being taken by the Home Office with reference to abscondingconscientious objectors, and decided to postpone thesubject for future consideration.8. The War Cabinet had before them a note by Mr. Bonar Law,covering a letter from Lord Cave (Paper G.T.-G294), suggesting theappointment of a Cabinet Committee to consider the Report of theDepartmental Committee, which was dealing with the regulations under the Defence of the Realm Acts, and to take such decisions as might be necessary.The War Cabinet decided To approve the appointment of a Committee with the powerssuggested, the Committee to consist of Lord Cave (Chairman).Mr. Barnes.Lord Milner.Mr. Munro.Mr. Shortt.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,November 19, 1918.Suspension of theDefence of the realm iRegulations.o
