THE Director of Military Operations reported that the news from France was extremely encouraging. The attack had been resumed that morning on the whole front of the Illrd and IVthArmies. Rapid progress was being made everywhere. We had captured 8,000 prisoners and many guns. There could now be noquestion that we had completely penetrated the whole of the siegfried defences, which were several miles deep, between Cambraiand St. Quentin. The Director of Military Operations said that wewere now at the crisis of the biggest battle of the war. Our troops had entered Cambrai; the Canadians were reported to be to thenorth-east of the town, and English troops to the south-east; it was probable that the Germans would be out of Cambrai that day.
2French Opinion ofBritish Troops.2. The Director of Military Operations read to the War cabinet an extract from a demi-official letter from General Grant (of GeneralDu Cane&apos;s staff), in which it was stated that General Weygand,in discussing our recent operations, said that he personally thoughtthat the battles carried out by the British armies since the8th August were models in their conception and execution, andwould live in history as classic examples of the military art.He was quite certain that Marshal Foch was of the same opinion,and intended to say so to the Prime Minister, when he saw him.Message of congratulation toField-marshal sir Douglas Haig.3. In reply to a question, the Director of Military Operationssaid that the last message of congratulation sent by the War Cabinetto Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig had been despatched on the I 3thAugust, after the magnificent British victory on the 8th August,which had resulted in the relief of Amiens. The Director of MilitaryOperations said that, in his opinion, no one day since the 8th Augusthad been comparable in importance to that victory until now. he submitted that the present would be a suitable occasion for anothermessage of congratulation.. The War Cabinet instructed The Director of Military Operations to prepare a draft message of congratulation, and to bring it up at the next meeting ofthe Cabinet, by which time further information would havebeen received as to how the present battle was proceeding.Message of congratulation toGeneral Milne.4. The Secretary of State for War said that he had authoriseda message of congratulation to be sent, in the name of the War-Cabinet, to General Milne, congratulating him on his success in the balkan theatre.The War Cabinet approved the action taken by the Secretary ofState for War.Message of congratulation tothe King of the belgians.5. With regard to the recent Belgiansuccess, the Director ofMilitary Operations said that the Belgians had been reported to have fought extremely well. Their Staffs, however, were naturallyinexperienced in active operations, and assistance had had to be rendered to them by us in the matter of food supplies. The King ofthe Belgians was in command of the operations, and had a Frenchmanas his Chief of Staff.The War Cabinet instructed The Director of Military Operations to bring up the question of sending a message of congratulation to the King of the belgians at the same time as the question of a message toSir Douglas Haig.. Macedonia. 6-        Director of Military Operations read to the War cabinet a telegram, dated the 8th October, from General Spiers, at Paris,indicating the plan of future operations in the Balkan Peninsula,the disposition of the different armies, and the general objectives.Capture of German 7- The First Sea Lord reported that on 4th October, duringTrawlers. patrol operations, some German trawlers had been captured withtheir crews.   The moral of the crews, who wer.e oldish men, wasvery low.
Steamship^ 8. The First Sea Lord reported that the steamship &quot; Otranto,&quot;.&quot; Otranto.&quot; bringing 700  United States troops trom America, had been  in collision with the steamship&quot; Kashmir &quot; and h;id been wrecked onthe (ith October. About 500 survivors had been brought toBelfast.Salving of 9. The First Sea Lord reported that a sunken enemy submarineSubmarine. ]!a(j been located on the East Coast.    There were hopes of salvingher and thereby gaining valuable information of a technical nature,as had been obtained in other cases.&quot;Dutch View of conditions inGermany.10. The Secretary uf State fur Foreign Affairs reported that sir William Tyrrell, of the Foreign Office, had had an interestingconversation with M. Colign, an ex-Dutch Minister, who was now engaged in commercial pursuits. He had b^en in this country onpetroleum business. Previously he had been supposed to havepro-German tendencies, but now it appeared to those who had seenhim that he was completely impartial. H* had expressed the viewthat people in England did not appreciate the degree to which theGermans believed they were beiDg beaten. In his opinion, theGermans Avould take practically any terms, and he thought that atthe meeting of the lieichstag on the following day this attitude would become manifest.Reparation for 1 L- With reference   to  War Cabinet   482,   Minute   10,   theActs of Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reported that he had written aDevastation. memorandum on this subject, which would shortly be circulated.The opinion was expressed that a general statement on thesubject would have a great effect on the German public.Mr. Long said that he had recently had a conversation with united States officers, who took a very strong view of the devasta-tion policy of Germany.A suggestion was made that all structural material should be denied to Germany until after France and Flanders had received all their requirements in that respect. A further suggestion was made that fines should be levied on German towns as equivalents for thefines which had been levied in France and Belgium.The War Cabinet decided that A further discussion should   be   held on the subject   afterMr. Balfour&apos;s memorandum had been received.Post-War Disposal 12. The War Cabinet had before them a recommendation by of Government the Economic Defence and Development Committee (contained in factories. Paper E.D.D.C., 9th Meeting, Minute 1), in regard to the disposalof Government factories.The War Cabinet ratified the recommendation of the Com-mittee.American 13. Lord Beading raised the question of various points whichEelations. were outstanding in connection with the United States of America,two of which  were of supreme importance. The first was thequestion of freight weights to be paid for transport of Americans inBritish vessels; and the second, the price to be paid for woolsupplied by the War Office for war purposes on purchase from australia. These two difficult questions had now been consideredby the various authorities immediately concerned, without it havingbeen possible to arrive at any decision agreeable to the respective departments on either side of the Atlantic.   He was particularly
anxious that these two questions should be settled as soon as-possible, as a certain amount of irritation had arisen, even with themost well-disposed Americans in regard to them. This irritationwas being reflected in all other Departments of the Administration.The freight question had arisen owing to the fact that the costof transport per capita, according to British blue book rates,amounted to between 101. and 111., whereas according to Americanblue book rates, which were considerably higher than ours, the cost per capita would amount approximately to 301. The BritishMinistry of Shipping had put forward a claim of 251. per man, andthe net amount at issue between the two Governments was between14,000,OOOZ and 15,000,0000, calculating- on the transport of1,000,000 men. An absolute impasse had been reached, and neither side appeared willing to give way.The wool question was even more complicated. American woolwas controlled hy the American War Industries Board, under mr. Baruch, whose goodwill was vital to us, as he had absolutecontrol over all American industries. The American authorities took the view that they should pay no more for Australian wool for war purposes than we had done, vdiereas the Director-General of supplies at the War Office in London, held the view that the Australian woolwas purchased at a specially low price owing to the arrangementcome to with the Australian Government in regard to the purchaseof Australian wheat, which we effected at a loss to ourselves.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs stated that, from hispoint of view, it was absolutely vital that these two outstanding questions should be settled. It was essential that causes of friction between us and the Americans should be reduced to a minimum, andthe Americans had a feelino- that we were endeavouring to makemoney out of them. He quite understood that the British Govern-ment Departments could not be expected to waive our claims unlessguided by higher authority.Mr. Long stated that the same sort of feelino- had arisen overthe question of oil. This had been got over by selecting oneMinister to whom^ all other Government Departments had referredtheir case. His own impression was that it would be expedient togive way to American opinion in regard to the two questions raisedby Lord Beading. He believed that the only chance of a settlement would be found in selecting one Minister and giving him absolutepowers.The Secretary of State for War agreed that it was most desirable that the outstanding questions should be settled as soonas possible. He thought that it would be easy to give way on thequestion of freight for the transport of American troops, but that,as regards wool, we must be careful to avoid it being said inAustralia that we were buying American favour with Australianmoney. He thought, however, the matter might safely be left in lord Beading&apos;s hands.Lord Reading said that, if the War Cabinet empowered himto deal with these questions on his return to America, be could onlydo so on the understanding that they could not be dealt with onany logical basis.The War Cabinet decided that-Cabinet authority should be given to Lord Reading to settlethese two questions with the American Government in washington, after consultation with the British ShippingController regarding freight, and with the War Office and colonial Office regarding wool, on the most favourable terms that he could.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,October 9, 1918.
