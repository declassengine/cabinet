There were indications   pointing   to  an  earlywithdrawal of the German armies in Flanders behind the Scheldt.Prince Rupprecht&apos;s Headquarters had left Monsfor Brussels, and theGerman Ivth  Army Headquarters had left Ghent for Malines, andthe Vlth Tournai for Hal. One of the Austrian divisions previouslythought to be on the Western front had been identified upon theItalian front.The Director of Military Intelligence stated that intelligencereports went to show that General Ludendorff had been dismissed bya Crown Council, and had not resigned. There was nothing definiteconcerning the rumoured dismissal or resignation of GeneralHindenburg.The Director of Military Intelligence reported that GeneralPlumers Army h-)d now returned under the command of Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, from serving under the command of theKing of the. Belgians.The Italian Front. 2. The Director of Military Intelligence stated that the armyoperating under General Lord Cavan had now advanced to a depth of 8 miles on a front of 7 miles. On its left, the VIHth italian army had advanced to a depth of 3 miles on a front of 6 miles.The XVIIIth Italian Corps was being pushed across the Piave to fill the gap between these two advances. There had been very littleAustrian resistance on General Cavan&apos;s front, but the Austrians had fought well against the Italians further north, in the Grappadistrict. The total number of prisoners taken in the offensive now amounted to 13,000.The Balkans. 3. The Director of Military Intelligence reported that the turks had now two divisions with their advanced guards stationed onthe Enos-Medea line, with advanced troops at Uzun Kupru.British advance-guards were approaching the Maritza down themain railway, and might soon be in contact. There had been delay in landing the 22nd Division at Dedeagatch, owing to bad weather,but as soon as this operation had been completed two British andone French divisions should be in a position to confront the Turks atMaritza. In regard to reinforcements, two Turkish divisions,namely, the 12th and 15th, were known to be coming from theCaucasus, while three other Turkish divisions, each of about 3,000rifles, were stationed, one in the Gallipoli Peninsula, and two oh the asiatic side. General Milne had, in addition to the three advanceddivisions, one British, two French, and three Greek divisions insupport.On the Danube front there were indications showing that theenemy proposed to hold the line Lemburg-Brasso-Belgrade-Antivari, in Serbian territory. Between Nish and Belgrade theenemy force opposing the French and Serbians consisted of the equivalent of 3 German and 2  Austrian divisions.Mesopotamia. 4. The Director of Military Intelligence reported that GeneralMarshalfs advance upon Mosul was being conducted in two columns.The other column had reached Kirkuk, and the Turks were retreatingin front of it. The other column was advancing up the Tigris andhad reached Kala Shergat. This column had apparently got the14th Turkish Division in a &quot; nut-cracker,&quot; our advanced troops beingbehind them. It was not certain, however, that this division wouldbe captured, owing to the supply difficulties which we wereencountering.
Palestine,5. The Director of Military Intelligence stated that general allenby&apos;s cavalry were now 14 miles north of Aleppo. The onlyTurkish elements remaining in front of them consisted of portions ofthe 1st, 24th, and 48th Turkish Divisions: in all, about 8,000 rifles.Great difficulty was being experienced by General Allenby in regardto supply and communications in the forward area, owing to thecondition of the Bey rout-Rayak and Rayak-Aleppo Railway.Accordingly, he proposed to base his advanced troops uponAlexandretta, and intended to send a division by sea and subse-quently another with a French detachment to that place.Lord Curzon drew attention to War Office telegram No. 69562,dated the 28th October, 1918, to Goneral Allenby, regarding Frenchdesiderata as to participation in any landing at Alexandretta. he wished to apprise the Cabinet of the serious trouble that was likelyto arise if it had not already arisen in regard to French aspirationsin Syria. Syria was likely to be the scene of great anxiety to us inthe future. We had conquered the country, and the French wanted the spoils. This would necessarily bring us in as third partiesto any dispute between the French and the Arabs.East Africa.6. The Director of Military Intelligence reported that von Lettowhad again escaped, and was now on his way to Tabora, accompaniedby 150 whites.Acts of Devastationby the Germans inBeigium.7.

The Deputy First Sea Lord stated that, on the 27th October,1918, a large enemy submarine had been destroyed in the North Sea.There were no survivors. There had been no attacks whatever on merchant ships by enemy submarines during the last forty-eight hours.Loss of H.M.S.&quot; Ulysses.&quot;8 a. The Deputy First Sea Lord announced the loss of the&quot; Ulysses/&apos; a new destroyer, which had been sunk early that morning,through collision with a collier transport, off the Clyde. All the crew had been saved.Attitude ofthe TurkishGovernment.9. Lord Curzon asked whether the Foreign Office had any opinion with regard to the attitude of the new Turkish Government,particularly whether it was true that the C.U.P. was still inexistence and in control of the Government.Lord Robert Cecil replied that the new Government of Turkey was undoubtedly a C.U.P. Government, who controlled the importantoffices other than the office of Grand Vizier, which was held by anAlbanian soldier, Izzet Pasha. We must assume that the new government is as un-Christian and anti-British as previous C.U.P.Governments, and we were quite unjustified in thinking that it waspossible to give easier terms to this new Government than were proposed for the late Government.Mr. Barnes said that it would be deplorable if the Armenianswere now left in the lurch. He hoped that in both the terms of armistice and the terms of peace we should obtain security in regardto them.Lord Robert Cecil said that the best security we could obtainfor the Armenians would be the military occupation and control ofthe Cilician Gates.[1365-492]B 2
Admiral Hope stated that reports from Mudros indicated thepossible withdrawal of the Germans from Constantinople.The Director of Military Intelligence said, in this connection,that the most recent information pointed to the existence of onecomplete German division in Constantinople.10. Lord Robert Cecil read to the Cabinet a telegram that hadbeen received from Copenhagen regarding the internal condition ofGermany. He was repeating this telegram to Mr. Balfour at versailles. He himself took the view that there was undoubtedlypanic in Berlin, and that the German Government feared a request from the Allies for the abdication of the Emperor. The GermanGovernment seemed anxious to save enough of that part of their army upon which they thought they could rely in order to keeporder in their own country.II. With reference to War Cabinet 432, Minute 7, the WarCabinet had under consideration a note by the Minister of Blockadeon the policy to be followed in the event of return convoy from theNetherlands East Indies to Holland (Paper G.T.-6009).The Minister of Blockade explained that various announcementshad recently appeared in the Dutch press as to the probable return of the Dutch convoy, and the nature of the cargo to be carried made it necessary for a decision to be arrived at as to the policy whichshould be adopted if the homeward convoy actually sailed. Thefollowing questions arose in this connection. Firstly, should thevessels be brought into port, to exercise the right of visit and search (a.) In spite of the Dutch claim of right of convoy ;(6.) In respect of cargo carried under the naval flags.Sir L. Worthington-Evans expressed the opinion that the answer to (a) should be in the affirmative, and that the answer to (b) shouldalso be in the affirmative, but that, in addition, a warning should besent to the Dutch Government that this action would be taken.The second question which arose was as to the action which shouldbe taken in regard to ex-German vessels transferred to the Dutchflag in compensation for the Dutch vessels sunk last year and likelyto be included in the homeward convoy. It was proposed, in this case, that these vessels should be seized as prizes if the conditions onwhich we had agreed to recognise the transfer were not fully-accepted. The third question was as to the action which should betaken, in the event of a general agreement with Flolland not being-reached, if it were found that the only cargo on board consisted of innocent cargo consigned either to (a.) The Netherlands Oversea Trust, or(&amp;.) The Netherlands Government.In the case of (a), it was submitted that such vessels should be detained pending the receipt of a guarantee, either from the Nether-lands Oversea Trust or the Netherlands Government, that the cargowas not to be utilised for export to Germany ; and that in the caseof (o), a warning should also be issued to the Netherlands Govern-ment, and the vessels detained pending the receipt of a similarguarantee. The final question which remained to be answered was whether the Government was prepared to insist on bringing vesselsinto port if resistance was threatened or actually made. Sir L.Worthington-Evans submitted that, in this case, the Governmentshould insist that such vessels should be brought into port.The War Cabinet approved the policy to be followed in theevent of a return convoy from the Netherlands East Indiesto Holland, as submitted by the Minister of Blockade.Internal Conditionof Germany.return of DutchConvoy from theNetherlands east indies.
WC 492Proposed public holiday onAmericanThanksgiving Day.12. The War Cabinet had under consideration a minute by theMinister of Information on the question of proclaiming Thursday,the 28th November, 1918, as a public holiday, to celebrate and givethanks for British victories.Colonel Buchan, who attended in the unavoidable absencethrough illness of the Minister of Information, explained that LordBeaverbrook had had under consideration the question of appropriatecelebrations of American Thanksgiving Day, Thursday, the28th November, and, as it was the policy of the Government toextend every courtesy to American troops in this country, andinadvisable that these troops should consider it strange that no oneelse should share their national festival, he had suggested thatThursday, the 28th November, should be proclaimed as a public holiday, so that the American Thanksgiving Day and the celebrationof the British victories might be held together.It was generally agreed that it was impossible to consider thequestion of proclaiming the 28fch November as a public holiday, butthat every assistance should be given to the Ministry of information in order that the American Thanksgiving Day. should be appro-appropriately celebrated by the American troops in Great Britain.The War Cabinet decided that Colonel Biiohan, acting on behalf of the Minister of Information,and with the authority of the War Cabinet, should ascertain the form of celebration of the American Thanksgiving Daywhich woidd be the most acceptable to the representativesof the American Government in England, and, after con-sultation with the War Office, should submit his proposals to the War Cabinet for their consideration.Alternative 13. The War Cabinet had under consideration two memorandaPensions of Officers&apos; by the Minister of Pensions on the question of increasing the ratioWidows. on Avhich the alternative pensions of officers&apos; widows are assessed(Papers G.T.-6103 and 5S76).The War Cabinet decidedi that This question should be referred to the Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos;Pay Committee for their report to the War Cabinet.Anticipated strike in Electric PowerUndertakings.14. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Labour on the possibility of a strike of the electrical trades Union (Paper G.T.-6085).The Minister of Labour said that he was asking the War cabinet for approval to take certain action in the event of a strike in electric power undertakings. The Electrical Trades Union had threatened to strike in order to compel all men who were in the electrical tradesto join their Union. Undoubtedly this was no legitimate cause fora dispute, and Mr. Roberts urged that drastic action should be taken.In the first place, he suggested that the Ministry of Munitions, theMinistry of Food, the War Office, and the Local Government Board,should, in collaboration with the General Officer Commanding Forcesin Great Britain, obtain confidentially from the boroughs the numbersof men who would be required to keep the undertakings running.Secondly, that, if a strike took place, the operation of the MilitaryService Act should be immediately applied to such men who wentout on strike, and who were liable to military service. Thirdly, thatthe facts should be submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions,so that if a strike took place immediate action could be taken againstthe instigators. Fourthly, that a statement should be prepared for communication to the Press, if necessary. The question had alreadycome before the Committee on Production, which had heard evidence and was discussing it again on the following day.   Mr. Roberts said
that this strike, if it broke out, might be very troublesome, and he considered that every possible action should be taken.The Deputy Minister of Munitions said that, so far as his department was concerned, all information as to the number of menwhich would be required to keep running the undertakings whichwould affect the Ministry of Munitions had been collated and sentto the War Office. General Seely said that he had been advised by his electrical expert that it was extremely easy to wreck a power station, and that, therefore, it was necessary that adequateprecautions for the protection of the plant should be taken.The Adjutant-General said that the War Office would do everything in their power, but that it was. difficult to prevent an individual doing considerable damage before he actually left thebuilding when going on strike, and suggested that the policeorganisation in the factory itself, and trustworthy men, shouldbe utilised to prevent such damage being caused.The War Cabinet decided that The Minister of Labour should convene a Committee with thefollowing composition The Minister of Labour (Chairman), and representativesof-The War Office,The Ministry of Munitions,The Local Government Board,The Home Office,The Board of Trade,The Admiralty,The General Officer Commanding Forces in Great-Britain,to remain in session during the strike, in the event of suchstrike occurring in the electric power undertakings, for thepurpose of co-ordinating the activities of the various departments in order to carry out the proposals of theMinister of Labour as put forward in his memorandum(Paper G.T.-6085), and generally of dealing with thestrike.Industrial 15. With reference to War Cabinet 491, Minute 1, the WarDemobilisations        Cabinet decided to ask General Smuts to convene a conference of Ministers specially concerned (a.) To consider the desirability or otherwise of forming a Cabinet Committee on Demobilisation and resettlement; and(6.) To make recommendations to the War Cabinet as toany powers urgently required by the departments in the event of an armistice being arranged withthe enemy in the very near future.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,October 29, 1918.o
