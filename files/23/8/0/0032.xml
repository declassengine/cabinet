1. LORD MILNER drew the attention of the Cabinet to thequestion of confining soldiers to barracks on polling day. He saidthat the matter was urgent and there was a good deal of agitationon the subject. By an Act dated April 1847, ail soldiers are confined to barracks on &quot; every day appointed for the nomination, or forthe election or for taking the poll for the election of a member or members to serve in the Commons of the House of Parliament.&quot;Lord Milner said that as the matter was one which was governed by statute, he had no power to issue any orders at variance with it.General Childs suggested that perhaps the difficulty might be overcome in the following way. The Act laid it down that nosoldier &quot; shall be allowed to go out of the barracks or quarters inwhich he is stationed unless for the purpose of mounting orrelieving guard or giving his vote at such election.&quot; If, however,the soldier were given leave a minute before the midnight preceding the polling day, he would not then technically be stationed at the barracks during polling day.Lord Reading suggested that a certain amount of latitudemight be applied to that part of the Act which read &quot; that everysoldier allowed to go out for any such purpose within the limitsaforesaid, shall return to his barracks or quarters with all convenientspeed.&quot;While the discussion on this subject was going on, a telegram was received by the Prime Minister from Viscount Curzon pointing out the trouble which was being experienced in his constituency onaccount of the order that soldiers were to be confined to barrackson polling day.The Prime Minister said that, unless the order were suspended,there would certainly be a strong feeling of resentment throughoutthe country. Polling was going to take place on the Saturday, andit was only reasonable for the soldiers to expect to be off duty from  p.m. onwards on that clay. If the soldiers were confined to barracks,there would be a keen sense of hardship. The Act in question,which dated from 1847, before the Ballot Act, was not applicable tothe present day, especially as all elections were now being held on one clay.Th Wir   Cabinet agreed That soldiersfand sailors should not be confined to barracks onpolling day.If this decision, which reversed the Act of 1847, were challenged,the House of Commons should be asked.for indemnityhaving regard to the fact that the matter had been over-lookecl during the stress of war.IThe War Cabinet decided That the Admiralty and the War Office should issue thenecessary instructions in accordance with this decision,and that an announcement of the decision should be issuedimmediately to the press.2. Attention was called to the fact that there was nothing inthe vpting instructions issued to absent voters to show that theenvelopes containing the voting papers to be sent by post could beso sent free of charge to the Returning Officers, as was intended.The War Cabinet decided That the Local Government Board should immediately issue a notice in the press to the effect that the absent voter couldsend his voting paper by post to the Returning Officerfree of charge, and that such a notice should be displayedin every post office in the United Kingdom.
WC 511Printers Mistakein the AbsentVoters&apos; ballot papers.Direction of allied action andMilitary Policy inRussia.3. The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to a mistakethat had occurred in the printing of a certain number of ballot papers for absent voters. The &quot;Daily Express&quot; that morning-had called attention to the mistake in the following paragraphs : &quot; A blunder affecting the absent voters, mostly sailors and.soldiers, has been discovered. It relates particularly tothe old two-member constituencies which have been sub-divided under the Franchise Act, and unless a remedycan be found immediately, thousands of service votes willbe invalidated. Soldiers and sailors have been invitedto put two crosses on ballot papers when only one should appear.&quot;&quot;The envelopes to absent voters contained a slip instructingthe electors how to vote. In the case of Portsmouth andPlymouth, and, we understand, other constituencies, suchas the Isle of Wight and Exeter, the absent elector hasbeen instructed to put a cross against the names ofTioo Candidates.&quot;Sir Horace Monro said that, as far as the Local GovernmentBoard were aware, a mistake had occurred in the despatch of formsof identity for absent voters a certain number of those intended for two-member constituencies having been sent from the stationery office to single-member constituencies; some of these had beenissued to absent voters. The number so issued did not, he under-stood, exceed 3,000, and might, be less. In the case of the Isle of wight the matter had been discovered and stopped in time. Itwas possible that the missing 3,000, or perhaps 1,000 of them, had gone to Plymouth. Unfortunately, it was now impossible to putmatters right in the case of the untraced 3,000 papers.4. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChief of the Imperial General Staff (G.T.-6433) on the future military Policy in Russia, and a memorandum (G.T.-6443) byMr. H. A. L. Fisher on the same subject.Referring to the difficulties in connection with the action ofthe Allies in Russia, Lord Curzon said that Mr. Fisher was not present to speak, on the subject. Mr. Balfour, however,. had on more than one occasion explained our policy. In spite of this,certain people appeared to be doubtful as to our policy, and questions were continually being asked.. Mr. Balfour said that he had written a paper on the subject,which was a very confused question. Our own people in Russianaturally thought of nothing but Bolshevism. The paper whichhe (Mr. Balfour j had prepared explained fully the policy of theBritish Government.Lord Curzon pointed out that, though our policy had been modified, in consequence of the cessation of hostilities, a difficultystill existed because a great many people in England objected toany British soldier still remaining in Russia, as they could not get out of their heads that they were there solely for the purposeof fighting Bolshevism.The Prime Minister said he had- a note before him from air. Shaw, who was standing for the Kilmarnock Division ofAyrshire, stating that he had been asked &quot; what our boys were doing in Russia.&quot;Mr. Balfour said that the paper which he had preparedexplained our policy. At the request of the Prime Minister,Mr. Balfour read the paper.   (Appendix.)Mr. Bailout- pointed out that the paper was primarily writtenso that the people in Russia, who were continually complainingthat we were not doing enough, might understand what our policy was.   It was written in reply to one class of critics, and by
implication answered other critics who inquired why our troops were still in Russia.Lord. Curzon concurred. If we withdrew our troops from someof the theatres of operations, such as Trans-Caspia, and left thepeople there to fight it out, it would mean misery to thousands of people who regarded themselves as our Allies, and almost certainmassacre.In reply to a question by the Prime Minister as to how manytroops we had in Trans-Caspia, Lord Ourzon stated it was difficultto say exactly, as it depended on what we understood by the termTrans-Caspia.It was pointed out that people at home were more concernedwith what was happening in Eastern Siberia and Archangel.In reply to Mr. Balfour, who asked how many troops we had inNorthern Russia, it was stated that the number was estimated at about 10,000.The Prime. Minister suggested that this was a very largeestimate, and pointed out that Great Britain could not go on keepingtroops in Northern Russia in order to protect some of the inhabitantsfrom their fellows.Lord Milner stated that if we withdrew the troops there wouldbe no doubt that massacres would ensue.Sir Henry Wilson pointed out that the troops were originallysent to Archangel to protect a submarine base, and further, that wecould not get them away from Archangel now that the winter had set in.The Prime Minister asked if during the winter mouths the force at Murmansk could assist that at Archangel if the latter were attacked by the Bolsheviks.Lord Milner replied that it could do so by moving round thesouth of the White Sea. The point was that it was not so much thedanger of our own force at Archangel, but if our troops were with-drawn the people who were friendly to us would be massacred.The Prime Minister said that was his very point, and, as he hadalready stated, we could not keep troops in Russia merely to protectcertain of the Russian people from their fellow-subjects.Mr. Chamberlain hoped that the War Cabinet would not cometo a hasty decision on such a big issue. He was ol: opinion that wewere under no little obligation to those people who had joined usduring the Avar. While entirely agreeing with the Prime minister that our troops should be withdrawn at the earliest possible moment,he thought the matter was one which required very careful con-sideration, and that the War Cabinet ought not to come to a decisionsimply because certain people asked questions during the election.The Prime Minister said he was under the impression that wehad already come to some decision in the matter.Lord Curzon stated that the decision which had been reached on the 14th November was that our troops were to remain. Thelocal Governments were doing their best to make good their positionagainst the Bolsheviks, and as soon as they could stand alone, wecould withdraw our troops. In the meantime, if we withdrew thetroops the people who were friendly to us would be butchered, and,in his opinion, our obligations in the matter were serious.Lord Milner pointed out that the difficulty was really that ourown people at home thought that the British troops were being usedfor the suppression of Bolshevism, which was not actually the case,as they were there simply to protect those people who had beenfriendly to us during the Avar.Lord Reading asked if the War Cabinet coidd come to any decision without consulting our Allies.Mr. Chamberlain said that, from papers he had seen, the Cana-guardians were very reluctant to send any troops to Eastern Siberia.Lord Curzon suggested that there were two ways in- which thematter might be dealt with, which were either by the Prime Minister-himself making a statement or by the issue of a statement by the
105Foreign. Office. Mr. Balfour&apos;s paper was prepared primarily for theconsumption of our people in Russia,- and he suggested that some statement should he issued for the information of the people athome.The Prime Minister said he could understand the necessity of keeping troops in Eastern Siberia and the Caucasus, but he couldnot understand the necessity for keeping troops at Archangel and murmansk.Lord Milner pointed out that we had made a treaty with thelocal Governments.Lord Curzon asked if physical conditions would not decide thequestion for us. If the troops could not be withdrawn from Arch-angel during the winter months, it would not be advisable towithdraw the garrison from Murmansk.The Prime Minister said that we wanted to decide what our policy was going to be, and he asked if it was suggested that, as a matterof honour, we should retain British troops in Northern Russia solong as there was any doubt about the local Governments being ableto maintain their own standing.Lord Milner stated that we must give time to the local Govern-ments to organise their forces so that they could hold their ownagainst the Bolsheviks.The Prime Minister doubted if they could do this for sometime to come, as he had heard only the other day that the troops ofone of the local Governments had refused to drill.Lord Curzon referred to a note which had been received fromGeneral Maynard, in which he (General Maynard) pointed out thatwe must still continue to maintain our troops in Northern Russia atall costs, as we had agreed to do so Avith the local Governments, asa withdrawal would simply mean massacre.The Prime Minister asked Lord Curzon what his interpretation of the agreement was, and pointed out that if it was against bolshevism, there appeared to him to be no limit to the length oftime for which we would have to maintain troops at the places inquestion.Lord Curzou said he had not got the agreement, but he thought we ought to stand by the local Governments, at any rate for awhile.Mr. Balfour said he was not certain as to the exact terms of theagreement, but he was quite sure it did not commit us for an indefinite length of time. The question w-as a very difficult one, andit had always been recognised as such by the Foreign Office. he further pointed out that some of the people with whom we were co-operating in Northern Russia had done most excellent work for us .during the war.The Prime Minister again reiterated his view that the BritishGovernment could not undertake the protection of the inhabitants ofany part of Russia against Bolshevism, and he pointed out that wehad originally intervened in Russia with a view to embarrassingGermany. Be further called attention to the possible difficulties ofproviding sufficient troops for all our requirements.Mr. Balfour said that there could be no question of our being-called upon to retain our troops in Northern Russia for an indefinitelength of time.The Prime Minister said if it was a point of honour now that weshould not withdraw our troops, it was quite possible that the sameargument might be brought forward in twelve months&apos; time.Mr. Balfour asked if it was realised that the French had justrecently sent a division to the Crimea to operate against theBolsheviks. This was quite a new undertaking and not the resultof any obligation on the part of the French. While fully appreciatingthe difficulties which the Prime Minister referred to, he thought thatif we were now to betray our friends in Northern Russia, we shoulddamage our credit with every orderly body in Russia.
Lord Reading suggested that, if we carried that point of view-too far; we might commit ourselves even still further than we had done.The Prime Minister agreed, but he said that he could not for a mount see that we were under any obligation to keep 10,000 menin Russia until Bolshevism was defeated, and he suggested that ifthe situation in Russia did not improve, it was conceivable that in four years&apos; time the same argument might be brought forward.Mr. Balfour thought that we ought not to assume that the local governments would not get stronger and be able to maintain them-selves.Lord Reading asked if it was necessary to come to a decisionnow&apos;.The Prime Minister stated that he did not for a moment want to come to a decision on account of the election ; he could not agreethat our policy must be to keep troops in Northern Russia until thelocal Governments were sufficiently strong to fight Bolshevismwithout assistance.Mr. Balfour and Lord Curzon stated that they entirely agreed with the Prime Minister on this point, but they both thought that we ought to retain troops in Northern Russia until the local Govern-ments were in a better position to hold their own than they were atpresent.The Prime Minister said he was not asking the War Cabinet tocome to a decision now, but he protested against anyone taking it for granted that we should retain troops in Northern Russia until3,000 Kerelians could beat 50,000 Bolsheviks. There was noobjection whatever to putting off the discussion until next week.Lord Curzon thought that it would be better to wait untilMr. Fisher could be present.Mr. Chamberlain said there could be no question that everyonewas in agreement that our troops should be withdrawn at theearliest possible moment, and what was to be decided was when that moment was likely to arise.The Prime Minister suggesed that if we continued to keeptroops in so many places, there would be discontent in the Army.He had been told already that there was a good deal of ill-feelingamongst the troops at Damascus because they had not been senthome, and requested the Chief of the Imperial General Staff to enquire into the matter. 1Lord Reading thought that very soon the United States wouldbe wanting to withdraw all their troops from Northern Russia.Mr. Balfour pointed out that if such a situation arose it would settle the matter, as we could not be expected to keep our troopsthere if the American troops were withdrawn.The War Cabinet decided that-Further discussion of the question should be postponed until next -week.5. The War Cabinet had before them memoranda by theSecretary of State for War and the Minister of Munitions (G.T.-6347and G.T.-G200), which Mr. Guedalla, on behalf of the Army Council,explained.The Prime Minister suggested that Lord Cave should be askedto consider the question.Lord Cave said be would probably put the matter before aCommittee.it was decided thvJt The question should   be   referred   to  Lord   Cave  for con-sideration.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,December 10, 1918.
APPENDIX.Notes on our Policy in Russia by the Secretary of Stale for Foreign Affairs,November 1, 1918.THE general tenor of the telegrams which reach me, not merely from Russiansources, but from our own officials who have to deal with Russian questions, seems toindicate a very insufficient apprehension of what His Majesty&apos;s Government aim atdoing to meet the present Russian situation. This is not, perhaps, surprising, seeing that the whole problem has been profoundly altered by the defeat of the enemy andthe terms of armistice which have been successively imposed upon our variousenemies.One result of this has been to modify the principal motive which prompted ourexpeditions to Murmansk, Archangel, Vladivostock, and the Caspian. So long as a life-and-death struggle was proceeding on the Western front between us and the CentralPowers, it was of the first importance to prevent, as far as possible, the withdrawal ofGerman forces from Russia to France ; but with the conclusion of a German armisticethis motive has no further force.For what then are we still maintaining troops in various parts of what was once the Russian Empire ? To judge by the character of the appeals made to us from many quarters, it seems commonly supposed that these military expeditions are partial andimperfect efforts to carry out a campaign against Bolshevism, and to secure, by foreignintervention, the restoration of decent order and a stable Government. We are constantly urged to send larger bodies of troops to carry out these great objects, and itis frequently suggested sometimes asserted that by our delay in sending theminvaluable opportunities for carrying out ah effective policy have been lost for ever.This view, however, indicates a complete misapprehension of what His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are able to do, or desire to do. This country would certainly refuse to seeits forces, after more than four years of strenuous lighting, dissipated over the hugeexpanse of Russia in order to carry out political reforms in a State which is no longer abelligerent Ally.We have constantly asserted that it is for the Russians to choose their own formof government; that we have no desire to intervene in their domestic affairs ; and thatif, in the course of operations essentially directed against the Central Powers, we haveto act with such Russian political and military organisations as are favourable to theEntente, this does not imply that we deem ourselves to have any mission to establish, ordisestablish, any particular political system among the Russian people.To these views Mis Majesty&apos;s Government still adhere ; and their military policyin Russia is still governed by them. But it does not follow that we can disinterest our-selves wholly from Russian affairs. Recent events have created obligations which lastbeyond the occasions which gave them birth. The Czecho-Slovaks are our Allies, andwe must do what we can to help them. In the south-east corner of Russia in Europe,in Siberia, in Trans-Caucasia and Trans-Caspia, in the territories adjacent to theWhite Sea and the Arctic Ocean, new anti-Bolshevist administrations have grown up under the shelter of Allied forces. We are resjxmsible for their existence and mustendeavour to support them. How far we can do this, and how such a policy will ultimately develop, we cannot yet say. It must largely depend on the course taken bythe Associated Powers, who have far larger resources at their disposal than ourselves.For us, no alternative is open at present than to use such troops as we possess to thebest advantage ; where we have no troops, to supply arms and money ; and in the caseof the Baltic provinces to protect, as far as we can, the nascent nationalities by the help of our fleet. . Such a policy must necessarily seem halting and imperfect to those who,on the spot, are resisting the invasion of militant Bolshevism. But it is all that we canaccomplish in existing circumstances, or ought to attempt.(Initialled) A. J. B.Foreign Office,November 29, 1918.    9
