The Weatern Front. 1.. THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that, inthe attack to the north of the Lys on the previous clay, a total of10,000 prisoners had been captured by the Allies. It had beenfound that the ehemy&apos;s forces in this attack had contained the sameten divisions holding the line, as before. On the whole front betweenSwitzerland and the North Sea it was reported that there were now only two fresh German divisions. The enemy were undoubtedly ina most difficult position, but, on the other hand, unfortunately,the troops of the Allies were greatly exhausted. The Chief of theImperial General Staff said that the Allies were now within 6 kilorn.of Thourout. Courtrai was now within range of our 0-inch howitzers,and the railway junction, which, fortunately, was outside the town,was being bombarded.Armistice with 2. With reference to War Cabinet 484, Minute 3 (Appendix,UT Annex 1), the attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to a, telegramfrom the General Officer Commanding, Aden, to the War Office,dated the 14th October, 1918, to the effect that, in the event of anyarmistice with Turkey involving the evacuation of occupied territory,it was hoped that the peculiar position of the Turkish forces inSheikh Said and Lahej would receive consideration. It would be undesirable to allow the Turks to retire beyond the Protectorateboundary into the Yemen unmolested, where they would be a potential source of much trouble, and their surrender should be insisted upon. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that instructions to this effect had already been sent to General Allenby.In connection with this question of a possible armistice with turkey, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he hadreceived two visits on the previous day : one from M. Venizelos, andthe other from the Italian Charge d&apos;Affaires. M. Venizelos had agreed that it had been perfectly proper, in the case of the Bulgarianarmistice, to exclude the Greek forces from entering Bulgaria, but hebegged that the Greeks might be allowed to take their share in anyoccupation in the event of an armistice with Turkey. The ItalianCharge d&apos;Affaires, who had called sodn after M. Yenizelos had left,had said that he had heard that Greek troops were to be used to occupy Smyrna. He had expressed the view that this would be agreat mistake, and contrary to the understandings which had beenreached in regard to Italian claims.It was pointed out that there was no immediate likelihood of smyrna being occupied by either the Greeks, the Italians, or anyother troops, and therefore, in these circumstances No decision was recorded.Attack on the 3. The First Sea Lord said that the enemy batteries on theBelgian Coast. Belgian coast had not been evacuated.   Our ships had got wdthin10,000 yards, and had heavily shelled the enemy, who had repliedvigorously.   The squadron had done a good deal of damage, and had returned without being hit.said by CoastalMotor-boats.4. The First Sea Lord reported that our coastal motor-boats had attacked and torpedoed a vessel called the &quot; Brussels,&quot; alongside theZeebrugge Mole, and had put her out of action. It was thoughtthat the &quot; Brussels &quot; was assisting in the evacuation of aerial stores.Our motor-boats had been heavily fired upon, but there were no casualties.
Peace and ArmisticeProposals:President Wilson&apos;sKeply.Presidents  mind  appeared to beUKt upon the kind of armisticemonstrate the high plane uponwhether the opinion of the Cabinetto  be taken  of President Wilsoifswhich would leave no rancour,which the Allies stand.The Prime Minister askedwas that some  notice oughtreply.Mr. Bonar Law said that the real point was that the Presidentought not to make these pronouncements without first consulting theother Allies. If the President had laid down terms which he would recommend the Allied Governments to discuss as a basis for peace,and if we could not accept these terms as a basis for discussion,there would be exposed to all the world a rift in the Allies&apos; policy.Lord Heading said that the situation was not a bad one for us.The Germans had asked President Wilson to handle the terms ofpeace, and he had so manoeuvred that the Germans were unlikelyagain to try to make peace through him.In the circumstances, the War Cabinet were of opinion that No message need be sent by the Foreign Office with referenceto President Wilsohs reply, beyond a civil expression ofwelcome in regard to the proposed visit of a representativeof the United States Government.Visit of the Prime 6. The Prime Minister read to the Cabinet a telegram which to WasHn t had be6n received,by the Secretary of State for the Colonies from  &apos; Canada to the effect that the Prime Minister of Canada was inVirginia and would shortly be visiting Washington. It was requested that Sir Robert Borden might be kept closely informed by theBritish Embassy, during- his visit to Washington, in regard to what-ever communications might be taking place on the subject of peaceovertures.o. &quot;With reference to War Cabinet 4 85, Minute 8, the WarCabinet had under consideration a telegram from Washington, datedthe 15th October (No. 4621), which had been despatched en olair,containing the reply of the United States Government to the german note (Appendix).In view of the fact that this telegram had been sent en clairand already communicated to the newspapers, the War Cabinet were of opinion that it would not be necessary for any statement to bemade on the subject in either House of Parliament.The Prime Minister then read to the Cabinet a telegram whichhe had received from Sir Eric Geddes, who was in the United States.Sir Eric Geddes reported that he had had a full talk on Sunday lastwith the President, whose attitude, now that lie had received theGerman reply, appeared to be hardening towards caution, (a) Hewas fully alive to the need for continuing the prosecution of the war.He proposed shortly to announce the undiminished despatch of troops and war effort of the United States. (6) He realised that the time had arrived when consultation with the Allied Powers was essential,(c) He had stated that our armistice terms, framed by naval andmilitary officers, must be viewed in the spirit that undue humiliationwould be inexcusable, except in so far as the enemy must be prevented from taking advantage of the armistice to re-form their forces and better their position, (d) He inclined to take Germanyto task for recent atrocities, e.f/., the sinking of the &quot; Leinster.&quot;(e) In talking of his Fourteen Points, the Presidents views on theFreedom of the Seas appeared to be unformed. (/) The president had referred to the absolute necessity for the break-up of Austria,owing to commitments to oppressed nationalities. The whole tone ofthe discussion had been most cordial, but he was outstandinglyfearful lest the naval and military authorities might urge an armisticeso humiliating that the German nation could not accept it.   The
The War Cabinet agreed to this proposal, and requested The Secretary of State for the Colonies to make the necessary arrangements with the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs for keeping Sir Robert Eorden acquainted with thesubject.Propaganda in re- 7. The War Cabinet had before them a letter addressed to theoSfstionof Peace Secretary of the War Cabinet by Lord Northcliffe covering a* -         memorandum by the Policy Committee of the British War Missionon propaganda in regard to the question of peace (G.T.-5934). Theletter requested that the assent of the War Cabinet might be givento the use of this memorandum as an outline of propaganda policy.The War Cabinet delegated to the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs the examination on their behalf of thememorandum with a view to ensuring that it was in all respects consistent with the policy of the British Govern-ment and its Allies before being used for propaganda purposes.Position of theNorthern neutral countries.8. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum byGeneral Smuts on the position of the Northern neutral countries(G.-224). General Smuts explained that on the 8th January, 1918,the War Cabinet accepted the recommendations of the NorthernNeutral Committee as put forward in Paper No. G.-186 dealingwith co-operation of British naval and military forces with theDutch naval and military forces in the event of danger to the island of Walcheren from German attack. General Smuts said that theDutch now considered they could deal with this question themselves,and had now requested us to base our plans on providing a certainnumber of troops to be landed in Holland as reinforcements, shouldHolland be attacked by Germany.On the advice of General Smuts the War Cabinet decided (1.) That their previous approval of the recommendations of theNorthern neutrals as put forward in Paper G.-18Gshould be rescinded.(2.) That with a. view to co-operation with the Dutch militaryauthorities in the event of an attack by Germany onHolland, the British Naval and General Staffs should beauthorised to work out the details of a scheme by meansof which as many divisions as the military situation might require could be transported and landed in someport to be agreed upon in Holland.(3.) That the supply of war material as authorised by the WarCabinet (G.-18G) should be continued as the exigencies of the shipping situation allowed.Reprisals for Acts 9. With reference to War Cabinet 475, Minute 9, the war of Devastation. Cabinet bad before th em a memorandum by Mr. Balfonr (G.T.-5931)outlining a scheme for carrying out reprisals against the enemy foracts of devastation in France and Belgium. Mr. Balfour suggestedwe should subject one or more of (say five) selected towns to-systematic bombing, and that we should give a number of days&apos;clear notice of our intention to do this in order to permit women and children to leave the threatened areas. After this we should proceed to action at any time convenient to ourselves. His idea wasto create as much panic.and destroy as much property as possible,and not in any way to select as our bombing objectives points of&quot;military importance or, necessarily, large towns.    He thought the
5WC 436enemy would be unable to defend with an adequate number of gunsany of the second-rate towns we selected for our operations.Lord Weir said the Independent Air Force was already devotingevery resource to the bombing of the lihineland towns, but latelythey had been greatly hampered by the weather conditions. his information was that these operations were having the desired effect,and the exasperation and panic in the Rhineland towms had greatlyincreased.It was pointed out that if the Independent Air Force undertookthese reprisals for the devastation of French and Belgian towns, itwould strengthen the French claim that the Independent Air force should be put under the direct command of Marshal Foch.Mr. Balfour said that as the Minister for Air did not appear tobe particularly attracted by his proposal he would not press it.Reparation for Acts 10. With reference to War Cabinet 475, Minute 9, the war of Devastation. Cabinet had before them the translation of a letter addressed to theBritish Ambassador in Paris endorsing a declaration of the french national Executive Committee for the complete reparation of damage caused by the war. Attention was drawn to the fact that theFrench Government had already addressed to us a communication onthis subject, and, as this communication was in very general terms,the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs had been requested by theWar Cabinet (War Cabinet 481, Minute 8) to ask the FrenchGovernment to define their proposals more closely. Mr. Balfour saidthat he had carried out the War Cabinet instructions in this matter,but had, so far, received no reply from the French Government.Attention was drawn to the fact that the French Governmenthad already issued an announcement on this subject, which had been published&apos;in the British press on the 7th October.The War Cabinet decided that It should be left to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs totake any action with the French and Belgian governments which he might consider appropriate.Sotdiers&apos;and 11. With reference to War Cabinet 477, Minute 4, the WarSailors Pay Com- Cabinet had under consideration the Seventh and Supplemenrarylji ll&apos; Interim Report of the Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Pay Committee (G.T.-5921).Mr. Barnes said that this report dealt wdth separation allowancesonly. The Committee over which he presided was authorised by theWar Cabinet (War Cab.net 479, Minute 14) to deal not only withthe question of separation allowances, but also with that of pay forthe three services. Tne latter question had been discussed, but norecommendations had yet b^en submitted in the report now beforethe War Cabinet. The Committee dealt with the case of the child-less wife, which case had been commented on very freely in theHouse of Commons, and about which the Government would un-doubtedly be questioned. The Committee recommended that the flat rate of 12s. 6d. per week should remain unchanged : the onlyalternatives to this being an increase of 100 per cent, to all, whichwould mean a total cost of some 00,000,0001. per year; or a smallerincrease of 2s. 6d. per week, which would amount to 11,000,000L ayear ; or a 2s. 6d. to childless wives only, which would cost 2,600,000/,.The case for any increase of the flat rate was not strong, as, of the400,000 childless wives, it was probable that 380,000 of them werewomen who had never set up homes and who were employed inGovernment offices or munitions factories. It. would be impossibleto raise the flat rate for the childless wife without raising the ratefor all wives.    The  Committee therefore recommended that the
supplemental allowances now payable by the Special Grants Com- ,mil lee should be increased from 4s. a week to 6s. Qd., and that theconditions under which it was paid should be so amended that this allowance was paid as a matter of course in every case where the woman was unable to work, unaccustomed to work, or unable toobtain work without change of residence. The estimated cost ofthis proposal was about 500,000/..With regard to the scale of separation allowances for womenwith children, this was based on the anticipation of a further increasein the cost of living from the time that the last concessions were madein July last up to the time the present recommendations would comeinto force, namely, January 1919. An increase of 25 per cent, in thecost of living might be anticipated during this period, and the recom-mendations now before the War Cabinet were, in effect, that the wife with one child would receive an increase of 18 per cent. ; the wife with two children au increase of 25 per cent. ; and the wifewith three or more children an increase of ^9 per cent. It was pro-posed that Is. a week should be added to the childrehs allowance forthe first child ; Is. for the second ; 2s. for the third; and Is. for thefourth and subsequent children, these amounts to be in addition tothe previous increases. The Committee also recommended thatIs. a week should be granted to the first motherless child, and Is.a week to the second and subsequent motherless children, in additionto the existing scales. The approximate estimate for these proposals was 9,765,000LThe Chancellor of the Exchequer said thst lie was afraid thatthese proposals would not satisfy all the criticism which had beenmade with regard to separation allowances. There were three points which had been particularly pressed with regard to the increasesannounced last July : (1.) That the extra allowances for children stopped at the secondchild. Jtftv^(2.) That the flat rate of 12s. 6d. for the childless^was too small.(3.) That the parents&apos;&quot; allowance of 5s. a week was only payableat the age of 21, and not payable to the parents of men serving below that age.The first point had been met by the present recommendations,but Mr. Bonar Law expressed the opinion that further concessionsought to be made with regard to the other two points.The Financial Secretary to the War Office said that the WarCabinet decided that it was desirable that women without children should be encouraged to work, and that, if the Government gave aseparation allowance which was sufficient to keep them in idleness, apremium would be put on idleness. Under the present recommenda-tions, the woman who was unable to work would have the supple-mental allowance as a right, and the proposals would come intooperation at once.The Prime Minister said that he was afraid that there was muchdissatisfaction amongst the soldiers themselves on the subject of separation allowances. He had been told by many officers, when in ,France, that the men said that their wives were in a far worse con-dition than the wives of munition workers. This was undoubtedly a real grievance, and it was not right that the Government should make concessions reluctantly in the case of soldiers when they had concededlarge concessions to every other class. When the first Committeewhich dealt with this question met, wages were low and the cost ofliving was not high ; now wages had doubled, as had the cost ofliving. The Government had provided for all those who were work-ing at home in security, and it was only right that they shouldadequately provide for the wives of the fighting forces of the Crown.It was pointed out that, while the increases as shown onTables A and B of the  Report did not  all show  100 per cent.
increase from the 1st October, 1914, until the present date, yet theGovernment had made material increases to the pay and allowances of the men, which, if taken into account, would bring the total increase up to, if not over, 100 per cent, of what was paid in 1914.In September 1917 the War Cabinet approved of the allotment of&apos;J.t. 6d. a week paid by the men being paid by the State, and inNovember of the same year the minimum pay of all ranks was increased by (id. a day. ft could therefore be said that the pay ofthe men had been increased by 7s. a week, which should be addedto the increases in Separation Allowances now granted.The War ( cabinet approved of the recommendations containedin the Seventh and Supplementary Report of the Soldiers&apos; and sailors&apos; Pay Committee, subject to the reconsideration of thequestion of the age at which Parents&apos; Allowances should be payable,and decided that The Chancellor of the Exchequer should have authority, inconsultation with the Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Pay Com-mittee, to decide whether Parents&apos; Allowances should bepavable at an earlier age than 21.The Coal Situation. 12. With reference to War Cabinet 476, Minute 11, the WarCabinet had under consideration the following memoranda on thesubject of the coal situation :  Memorandum by the Coal Controller (Paper G.T.-5597J.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour (Paper G.T.-5533).Letter  from Sir  A.   Nimmo  to  the  Prime  Minister  (paper g.T.-5737;.Recommendations  by the Allied Maritime Transport Council(Paper G.T.-5866).Memorandum bv the President of the Board of Trade (paper g.T.-5901)&quot;.Memorandum by the Minister of Munitions (Paper G.T.-5966).The President of the Board of Trade said that, in spite of manvappeals to owners and men, the coal situation was not improved, andthat there was no substantial increase in output. It would be wrong for the Government to hope for the position to be improved throughany effort made by the men. Not only was the spirit not there,but the Miners&apos; Federation was not in any way helpful. Sir albert stanley expressed the opinion that a decision must be taken now,and urged that the country should be informed that there will be ashortage of coal, and that this shortage must be faced, if it wasdecided that miners were not to be brought back very speedily fromthe Army. Both the Coal Controller and he had made the state-ment that sufficient men were not going to be sent back tore-establish the situation, but there was a general feeling that, ifcontinued pressure were brought to bear on the Government, more men would he brought back. The Coal. Controller stated that,while there was a slight improvement on the September output ascompared with August, an output based on the best week would only give 221,000,000 tous for the year. Speaking for himself,Sir Albert said that he recommended that miners should not bebrought back ; but if this decision were taken it would be necessaryto face the facts that there would be a grave shortage of coal, that many people would be thrown out of employment, and that therewould be grave difficulties and hardships during the winter. Itshould also be realised that the distribution of coal could not be socontrolled as to secure an adequate supply for household purposes ;and, as regards industry, the shortage would mean that hundreds of thousands of people would be thrown out of employment.Lord Curzon asked whether more could not be done by pressure
of public opinion. The country at large did not realise that it was going to suffer because one portion of the community was not doing-its fair share of work. The general public only saw one side of thecase in the newspapers, and, as it appeared, the output could bevoluntarily increased by the action of the men themselves, the effectof public opinion on the men would be very considerable. Tt hadundoubtedly been so in the case of the railway strikes.Mr. Layton, representing the Ministry of Munitions, said thatthe demand for steel for work in munitions bad been very insistent,and that a special allocation of steel had had to be made to meetthe demand of the American army in the field, but that it wasnot possible to hope that the American army could be supplied withany large quantity. The Ministry could not reduce its steelbudget below 9,500,000 ingot tons for the coming year, as against10,000,000 tons last ye&amp;v. Only a very slight reduction in the coaldemand had been found possible after every effort had been made,but it had been decided not to press for the increased demand of5,000,000 tons of coal in addition to last year&apos;s budget, which had previously been asked for. Mr. Layton referred to the memorandumby the Minister of Munitions (Paper G.T.-5966), and said it was a fact, particularly in Scotland, that bis Department was not receiving-even the reduced requirement upon which their plans were based.At the present time, with regard to munitions, both the French and ourselves were living largely on stocks in hand. The French stock of 75-m m. gun ammunition had been reduced by 50 per cent., andwe were at the present time using more munitions than we could produce. The reserve was far lower than it was last year. Asregards the American army, it would be a prudent course to assume that no big supply of munitions would be available from Americauntil the beginning of the Spring Campaign.Sir Robert Home, speaking with regard to coal used by admiralty contractors and suppliers, said that as the Cabinet had instructed the Admiralty to discuss the matter with the Ministry ofMunitions, he had carefully gone into it with Sir James Stevenson,and the only feasible way in which consumption of coal could bereduced was by a restricted use of steel. The Admiralty were taking this year 200,000 tons of .steel less than was previouslythought would be required. This was due to the fact that less than was estimated had been taken for merchant shipbuilding. It was hoped, however, that there would be a considerable increase inmerchant shipbuilding next year, which would require more steel.Owing to the fact that a certain amount of steel had beenaccumulated in yards and purchased from America, it would bepossible for the Admiralty to get on with the same supply of steelas this year, but it could not do with less.The Shipping Controller said that it was impossible for his department to do with less coal than that asked for. Already theneutral countries which had been guaranteed a supply of coal inreturn for other commodities, were not getting it, and a difficult situation wras being created. Sir Joseph Maclay expressed theopinion that it was essential that miners should be brought back from the army.The Coal Controller, referring to the coal ration allowed forhousehold consumption, said the average ration was between 3^ and5 tons. This was not nearly as much as the average pre-war consumption. Sir Guy Calthrop said that the position now wasthat, doing all that was possible, coal could not be supplied to meetpresent needs, and that also it was quite impossible to meet theAmerican demand for tins Expeditionary Force. He had asked for50,000 Class &quot;A&quot; men. Up to the present, 25,899 miners hadbeen returned, mostly Class &quot; B 2 &quot; and &quot; B 3,&quot; and these men could only do an amount of work equal to that of about 16,000&quot;A&quot; men. He therefore asked, in addition to all the &quot;B 2&quot; and&quot; B 3 &quot; men available, that the balance to make up the equivalent of
50,000 Class &quot;A&quot; men should be provided by the services frontcategories &quot; B 1 &quot; or &quot; A.&quot; It was calculated that, if this were done, the output in coal would be increased by about 12,500,000 tons per annum.The Assistant-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs called theattention of the War Cabinet to the recommendations of the allied maritime Transport Council (Paper G.T.-5866) with regard to the double bunkering of vessels coming from America being extremelywasteful.The Minister of Labour said that the possibility of some 500,000people being thrown out of employment was causing him great anxiety. If this occurred, the Government would undoubtedly haveto provide unemployment benefit. He could see no alternative butto bring miners back from the army in France.The Secretary of State for War urged that this was the most fortunate moment possible to ask Generals in the field to releaseminers to return to the mines. Every day the army in France waspushing forward against a weak enemy, and if Field-Marshal sir douglas Haig had 100,000 fresh men to put into the line, the enemyfront would undoubtedly be hopelessly broken. Lord Milner said thathe could not imagine anything more undesirable than the. effect whichwould lie produced on the army at the front if these men were taken away at the present time. Also, it was not possible, in Ids opinion,to release any from the training camps at home. There were pratically no miners who were called up at the end of March whowere not now trained men. The majority of these had ^one abroad,and those still remaining at home formed reserves for the Guardsand machine-gun corps both of winch would practically cease to exist if these men were taken. The real trouble seemed to be the disposition of the miners at home not to do their best, and it was notat all certain that the return of these men would increase the output to the extent anticipated by Sir Guy Calthrop.The Prime Minister said that it had been decided some time agoto make special efforts to appeal to all those engaged in mining toincrease the output. These special efforts bad been made, but whileit could be said there was substantial improvement, it must be realised that the minimum amount of coal required for household and indus-trial consumption would not be got this winter. The fault was not entirely with the miners, although those directing the Miners&apos;Federation were not in any way helpful, but it rested also with the colliery proprietors and managers to a certain extent. Mr. LloydGeorge said he regretted nothing more earnestly than the necessityof bringing any men back from the army. Only a short time ago hehad been talking with the Commander-in-Chief, and, in view of whatField-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig had then said, he would not take-one single man back from the army if it could possibly be avoided.It was impossible, howeArer, to face the probability of 500,000 men being thrown out of employment, and especially at the present time,when so much depended on the moral of the people. If the presentpeace overtures failed, undoubtedly there would be some disappoint-ment which would cause trouble, but this trouble should not beaccentuated by unemployment and distress if it could be avoided.At the same time, it was most undesirable that any men should betaken now out of divisions which were actually in the line, andMr. Lloyd George suggested that miners should be returned from thearmy at the present time only Irom divisions wdiich had come out ofthe line, which were now resting, and which would not be employedagain this year for active operations. Mr. Lloyd George said thatthe Cabinet must in any case be free to consider, in the event of operations continuing next year, whether it would not be necessaryagain to take the miners from the mines into the army.
The War Cabinet decided that The Secretary of State for War, the First Lord of the Admiralty,and the Air Minister should transfer to the Reserve theirrespective quota of miners up to the numbers and of themedical categories asked for by the Coal Controller, subjectto the conditions that men from the Army will be taken, inthe first instance, from divisions which have been with-drawn from active offensive operations, and which will notbe employed again this year for active operations, andthat the Admiralty should be authorised to withhold therelease of stokers serving in the Royal Navy.13. The War Cabinet had before them the following Parliamen-tary Question, of which notice had been given by Mr. Jowett: &quot; To ask the Prime Minister whether the Government has considered the initiation of legislation to allow women to stand for Parliament, and whether he will give time for debate on aPrivate Members Motion on which the House might record itswishes in this matter.&quot;The War Cabinet decided To leave the question to the decision of the House of Commons.2.

APPENDIX.Mr. G. Barclay to Mr. Balfour. (Received October 15, 1918.)(No. 4621.)   En elair. . Washington.FOLLOWING!- is reply of United States Government to German note : &quot; Unqualified acceptance by present German Government and by large majorityof German Reichstag of terms laid down by President of United States of America inhis address to Congress of United States of Sth January, 1918, and in bis subsequentaddresses justifies President in making frank and direct statement of his decision withregard to communications of German Government of Sth and 12th October, 1918. Itmust be clearly understood that process of evacuation and conditions of armistice are matters which must be left to judgment and advice of military advisers of UnitedStates Government and Allied Governments, and President feels it his duty to saythat no arrangement can be accepted by United States Government which doesnot provide absolutely satisfactory safeguards and guarantees&quot; of maintenance of present military supremacy of armies of United States and Allies in field. He feelsconfident he can safely assume this will also be judgment and decision of AlliedGovernments. President feels it is also his duty to add that neither UnitedStates Government nor, he is quite sure, Governments with which United StatesGovernment is asssociated as a belligerent will consent to consider an armistice so longas armed forces of Germany continue illegal and inhuman practices which they stillpersist it. At very time that German Government approaches United States Govern-ment with proposals of peace, its submarines are engaged in sinking passenger ships at sea, and not ships alone, but very boats in which their passengers and crews seek to make their way to safety, and in their present enforced withdrawal from Flandersand France, German armies are pursuing course of wanton destruction which hasalways been regarded as in direct violation of rules and practices of civilisedwarfare. Cities -and villages, if not destroyed, are being stripped of all theycontain not only, but often of their very inhabitants. Nations associatedagainst Germany cannot be expected to agree to cessation of arms while acts ofinhumanity, spoliation, and desolation are being continued which they justly look uponwith horror and with burning hearts. It is necessary also, in order that there maybe no possibility of misunderstanding, that President should very solemnly call attention ofGermany to language and plain intent of one of terms of peace which German Governmenthas now accepted. It is contained in address of President delivered at Mount Vernon on 4th July last. It is as follows : &apos; Destruction of every arbitrary power anywhere that can separately, secretly, and of its single choice disturb peace of world, or, if it cannotbe presently destroyed, at least its reduction to virtual im potency.&apos; Power which hashitherto controlled German nation is of sort here described. It is within choice ofGerman nation to alter &apos;it. Presidents words just quoted naturally constitute acondition precedent to peace if peace is to come by action of German people themselves. President feels bound to say that whole process of peace will, in his judgment, depend upon definiteness and satisfactory character of guarantees whichcan be given in this fundamental matter. It is indispensable that Governmentsassociated against Germany should know beyond a peradventure with whom they are dealing. President will make a separate reply to Royal and Imperial Government ofAustria-Hungary.&apos;&apos;
