THE Director of Military Operations reported that there wasno fresh information beyond that which had already appeared in thecommuniques.With regard to the capture of St. Quentin, which had been takenby the French, this was a regular bastion in the Hindenburg line,and the French could not have taken it without the support whichwas rendered by the, British to the north of the town. It. was reported that the Germans had now evacuated the whole of St.Quentin except a suburb on the east side.The Director of Military Operations reported that there hadbeen very heavy fighting round Cambrai, and it was probable thatthe German casualties would be exceedingly heavy. The Canadian[1365-481] B
troops had done very well: they had beaten off the German counter-attacks, and finally had made progress. It was expected thatCambrai would soon fall.Palestine.2. The Director of Military Operations reported that general allenby had taken Damascus at 6 a.m. on the previous day. he understood that instructions had been sent to the effect that theArab flag should be hoisted in Damascus.Macedonia.3. The Director of Military Operations reported that there wasno fresh news from Macedonia except that thirty-four Germanbattalions were believed to be in Macedonia, of which sixteen hadalready been identified. Some of these troops had come from roumania, some from Crimea, and one regiment which had beentaken away from Palestine had been identified.Mesopotamia. 4. The War Cabinet had their attention drawn to the importanceof our taking advantage of our successes in Palestine and Syria to exploit the situation in Mesopotamia; and some anxiety was expressed as to the small degree of progress which General Marshall appearedto be making in that theatre of war. The Director of MilitaryOperations said that General MarshalPs progress was largely aquestion of transport ; he was puling forward to the Caspian,and was making full use of all the transport available, but in so doing he had been obliged to demobilise to some extent the rest ofhis forces under his command.The Secretary of State for War said that the War Office were fully impressed with the importance of advancing as far as possible inMesopotamia, and more particularly the capturing of Aleppo, andthus getting control of both the lines. He undertook that any steps for exploiting the situation in Mesopotamia, which were feasible,should be taken.Surrender of 5. In continuation of War Cabinet 480, Minute 1, the SecretaryBulgaria. of State for Foreign Affairs said that he had received a visit fromthe French Ambassador on the previous day, when M. Cambon. had informed him of certain supplementary provisions which had been added to the terms of the armistice. One of those additions was inthe sense that any occupation of strategic points should be carriedout by the three Great Powers, excluding Serbia and Greece. Thesecond of the additional provisions was that three Bulgariandivisions were to be left mobilised and efficient. One of thosedivisions was to guard the northern approaches and the crossings ofthe Danube ; the second was to guard the eastern approaches from turkey ; and the third was to control the railways under our orders.The War Cabinet requested the Director of Military operations to telegraph to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, who had gone to Paris, the above information in regard to keeping the threeBulgarian divisions mobilised.Allied Policy in siberia.
The Director of Military Operations said that the success of theArchangel expedition, in the War Office view, depended on the forceof our intervention from the East, and, owing to the delays in thedespatch of United States troops, there was little likelihood of thesetwo forces joining hands before the winter.Lord Robert Cecil said that his only doubt was whether he had stated too definitely in his despatch that our military authoritiestook the view that we should be able to hold the line of the Volga.The Director of Military Operations said that he thought itmight be too bite now to do this. He did not, however, think it quite impossible to hold the line of the Volga, as the situation in theEast changed so much from day to day, and was greatly influenced by the events on the Western front.Lord Robert Cecil said that President Wilson&apos;s view was thathe would send supplies to Siberia, but would not guarantee to send them beyond the Urals. He wanted to know whether our militaryauthorities thought that we could, with the assistance of only the-Japanese and the French, supply the Czechs with everythingnecessary, or were we entirely dependent on the United States.The Director of Military Operations said that he could notanswer this question off-hand, but he doubted if much could bedone without the assistance of American supplies.Mr. Balfour said there was always a possibility that theJapanese might say thai the American Government having laiddown the line of policy that was to be followed in Siberia, they(the Japanese Government) did not feel inclined to go beyond that policy, and if the British Government proposed to render fullassistance to the Czechs it would have to be done with the assist-ance of the French and Italians only.It was suggested that the only alternative to sending this despatch was for us to go on without giving any information to president Wilson.Lord Reading said that he agreed absolutely with Lord robert cecil&apos;s draft, and it was exactly the way in which he himself wouldhave approached the President. He thought it would be unwisenot to inform President Wilson of the steps we proposed to take.Lord Curzon said that he was not afraid of what PresidentWilson might reply to our despatch, but he did fear that if wewere not able to effect a junction with the Czechs to the west of the Urals there might be a military disaster. We were under-taking a dangerous and precarious task.The War Cabinet decided that The draft despatch should be sent to Washington, but that itshould not emphasise too strongly the point that our military authorities thought we should be able to hold theline of the Volga.SibST Tr0OPS bi With reference to War Cabinet 475, Minute 7, the WarCabinet had before them a memorandum by the Chief of theImperial General Staff (Paper 2\&apos;o. G.T.-5S28) with regard to the raising, by General Ivnox, of a force of 3,000 men with theassistance of General Dietrichts.The approval of the War Cabinet having already been givenfor the raising of these men (War Cabinet 475, Minute 7), the WarCabinet reqiiested The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to telegraph to washington informing the United States Government ofthe steps we had taken, adding at the same time that we did not consider our undertaking inconsistent with american policy.
Separation for Acts 8. With reference to War Cabinet 475, Minute 9, the war of Devastation. Cabinet had before them a note by Mr. Balfour, covering amemorandum from the French Embassy (Paper No. G.T.-5724),together with a note from the Under-Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs covering a note from the War Office ( G.T.-5842), withregard to the question of Reparation for Acts of Devastationperformed by the Germans in France.Mr. Balfour said that this raised a very difficult question, for if germany surrendered at discretion, he did not see how it was possibleto draw up a list of French towns that had been unnecessarilydestroyed by the Germans, and say that we would destroy a likenumber of German towns. Then a policy of this sort assumed thatour army would cross the Rhine into Germany.Mr. Balfour suggested to the War Cabinet that as thememorandum from the French Embassy did not give a very clearidea of what the French Government proposed to do, he shouldmake a sympathetic reply to the French Government, and requestthem to put forward some formulated plan for the considerationof the War Cabinet.The War Cabinet approved of Mr. Balfour&apos;s suggestion.League of Nations. 9. With reference to War Cabinet 457, Minute 8, the WarCabinet had before them a memorandum by Mr. Barnes (PaperNo. G.T.-5815) on the subject of the League of Nations.Mr. Barnes thought that the time had come for the Cabinet toexamine the question on its practical side. Hitherto the Leaguehad been freely discussed only in rhetorical terms, and he was afraid that, if no advance was made beyond that stage, when peacecame it would be lost sight of altogether. It was highly desirablethat the Allies should come to some mutual understanding on thesubject. Such understanding, however, must necessarily be pre-ceded by a discussion on the part of each of the Allies if their views were to reach any degree of clearness before the time came todiscuss terms of peace. At present no precise views on the ques-tion had been formulated. Meanwhile the Germans were exploitingthe idea, and it might be dangerous to let them be first in the fieldwith definite proposals. He believed that if the scheme of a Leagueof Nations admitted the adherence of a democratic Germany, andthis were made known to the German peoples, it might bring asatisfactory ending to the war appreciably nearer.Mr. Balfour said that, as had been pointed out at the meetingof the War Cabinet when the question had last been discussed onthe loth August, the main difficulty in the way of Mr. Barnes&apos;suggestion was the President of the United States. His Majesty&apos;sGovernment had appointed the Phillimore Committee to examinethe whole question, and had received the Committee&apos;s InterimReport, which had been sent to the President with a proposal thatit should be published as a basis for discussion. President Wilson,however, had so far made no move in the matter. He suggestedthat the President might be privately informed that Lord Readingwas empowered by His Majesty&apos;s Government to discuss thequestion with him unofficially and informally, as the BritishGovernment greatly desired to work hand in hand with the UnitedStates, and attached importance to some amicable mutual arrange-ment being reached by the two Governments before the question was referred to the other co-belligerents. He proposed to askLord Robert Cecil to study the reports of the Phillimore andFrench Committees and to draw up a memorandum which woulddifferentiate between those points which were controversial andthose which were, in the main, generally acceptable. As soon as this memorandum had been drafted, Ministers might meet at theForeign Office to discuss the question quite informally, in order
that Lord Reading might be fully acquainted with the views of theGovernment before he returned to the States. On his arrival therehe would, by means of private conversations, ascertain the views ofthe United States Government, and he would, of course, keep theForeign Office au courant with all that emerged from thoseconversations.Lord Robert Cecil said that, just before President Wilson had made his last speech, he was shown a copy of it by the UnitedStates Charge d&apos;Affaires, and had been asked to say how HisMajesty&apos;s Government regarded the different propositions putforward in the speech. In Lord Robert&apos;s view, the whole point ofthe speech lay in the reference to the League of Nations, in respectof which the President had made two very definite propositions :(a) that the League of Nations must come into existence at thePeace Conference, and (6) that it must include all free nations. Hethought that our reply to this should be that we agreed that theLeague of Nations must come into operation at the Peace Con-ference ; that the Allies must have a definite scheme to bring forward ; and that the Allies must, further, set up a special conference to discuss and prepare that scheme. He thought we should furthersay, as regards the place of assembly for the Conference, we ourselves were quite prepared to agree to its meeting at Washington,in which case it would be left to the President to issue invitations tothe principal co-belligerents.Lord Reading said that the reason why the President hadobjected to the immediate publication of the Report of the PhillimoreCommittee was that, if it were published, it wTould generally beregarded as having been issued under the aegis of the BritishGovernment. This would force the hand of other Governments andraise a premature discussion. President Wilson&apos;s view was thatthere must be some kind of general agreement on the subjectamong the co-belligerents before any Peace Conference met, and hewashed in the first instance to discuss the question with the BritishGovernment, so that they might concert some agreed scheme for a league of Nations before it was submitted to the other chiefEntente Powers. Lord Reading said that he himself, like thePresident, attached great importance to the desirability of thequestion being discussed in the first instance between Great Britainand the United States alone, in order that they could arrive at aAvorking basis before the matter w-ent further. The crux, in hisviewr, w&apos;as the final &quot; sanction,&quot; but this was not a matter of principle ;the difficulty was how to enforce the decrees of any internationalcouncil or tribunal. Lord Reading expressed his readiness to take&quot;the earliest opportunity, on his return to the States, of ascertainingwhat the views of the President were ; but before he left England itwas essential that he should be fully seized of the views of HisMajesty&apos;s Government. He understood that there was no questionof his arriving at any definite understanding with the President,but that he was tnerely instructed to conduct an interchange of opinions.Lord Curzon agreed that, before Lord Reading initiated anyinformal conversations at Washington, it w-as necessary that heshould be fully apprised of the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s government-ment. To this end he thought that Ministers should be given anearly opportunity of expressing, informally or otherwise, their considered views on many difficult points raised in the PhillimoreReport, e.g., the idea of an International Court, whose decisions would be enforced, had been rejected by the Phillimore Committee,which had recommended that international coercion should only beapplied in order to enforce the holding of a Conference whichshould endeavour to arrive at a pacific settlement of international disputes. To his mind, the test question was, How were the decreesof the Conference to be enforced? Was the necessary pressure tobe military or economical in character?   If military, was it to be
international *?   There was the further important question of controlof armaments, supplies, &amp;c.Mr. Montagu said that, in his opinion, the two most difficult problems were: (a) the question of the &quot;sanction,&quot; and (6) thetreatment of our present enemies. In regard to this latter, werewe to have no peace with the Hohenzollerns, and were we to statethat the German peoples should not be admitted to the League at &apos;present, but might be later when deemed fit for admission ? OurColonies also had to he considered, and these would certainly not wish the Germans to be allowed to enter the League until they had given acceptable guarantees of their future good behaviour.The Secretary. reminded the War Cabinet that when thequestion had been discussed at their 457th Meeting, the PrimeMinisters of the Dominions had been present, and it was wellknown that some of them held strong views on the subject. Hesuggested, therefore, that these Prime Ministers would naturallyexpect, when the question of a League of Nations was againdiscussed by His Majesty&apos;s Government, that either they or theirrepresentatives in this country would be invited to attend.This view was generally accepted, but Mr. Long pointed outthat Mr. Hughes and Mr. Lloyd were the only Prime ministers at present in England. If the League of Nations were discussed with the representatives of the Dominions it was very important that Sir Robert Borden&apos;s views should be represented, more par-ticularly as he was believed to take an entirely different view from .Mr. Hughes. Sir George Kemp, however, who, in the ordinary course, would have been invited to represent Sir Robert Borden,was at present in Canada. In these circumstances, as an essential preliminary to a discussion with the representatives of the Dominions,he would have to telegraph for Sir Robert Borden&apos;s views. Unfor-unfortunately this would involve delay, as Sir Robert Borden was absenton a holiday, and not easily accessible.It was generally agreed that any considerable delay was very undesirable, and that, at this stage, a formal discussion by the WarCabinet or Imperial War Cabinet was premature.The War Cabinet decided that -(a.) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should arrangefor an informal meeting of Ministers, to be held at theForeign Office at an early date, not to take any formaldecision, but further to explore the subject of a Leagueof Nations, in order to give Lord Reading an opportunityto acquaint himself with the general trend of the viewsheld by members of His Majesty&apos;s Government thereon,before his return to the United States.(b.) That, as a preliminary to this short discussion, Lord R. Cecilshould circulate a memorandum on the line suggested bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.(c.) That Lord Reading should take the earliest opportunity,after his arrival at Washington, of initiating private andunofficial conversations with the President, or anyofficials deputed by him, with a view to the free and frank interchange of views on the subject.(d.) That Lord Reading should report from time to time to theForeign Office the result of the said conversations, andthat he should make it clear to the President that such conversations in no way committed His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to any agreement on the subject, or to any definite line of action.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,October 2, 1918.
APPENDIX.Draft Telegram to Mr. Barclay, Washington.YOUR telegram No. 4386.We fully appreciate the attitude of the United States Government and their desire to act in such a matter in accordance with the advice of their militaryauthorities. Our position is, however, a little different from theirs. In the first place,our military authorities do not take the same view. As far as they are able to judge,the Czechs, if given full support by the Allies, should be able, in conjunctionwith the forces under General Alexief, to hold the line of the Volga against anyforce that is likely to be brought there. The position is very obscure, andpossibly further information might modify their judgment, but that is the presentview taken by our soldiers. Apart from this, we feel the very greatest reluctance toabandon the elements in Russia loyal to the Allies. General Alexief, for instance, hasfought throughout the war against our enemies, and in the early part of it he and his troops rendered essential and heroic services to the Allied cause. &apos; Since the revolutionhe has never wavered, and we know that he has resisted many approaches from theGerman side, backed though they were by old associates of his, such as Miliukof. we feel, therefore, honourably bound to do our very utmost, even at some risk to our own interests, to come to Ins assistance. If we were now to ask the Czechs to withdraw tothe east of the Urals, that would be to cut off from Alexief and those with him their last hope- of Allied assistance. We therefore propose, subject to any observationthat the United States Government may have to make, to present this view of thesituation to our French and Japanese Allies, and to appeal to them to continue their efforts to stand hy our friends in European Russia. We quite recognise that the aboveconsiderations do not apply to the United States in the same way as they do to thosewho fought side by side with the Russians in the early part of the wTar, and the BritishGovernment will quite understand it if the American Government feel unable to takea more active line than that indicated in the telegram under reply. We venture,however, to express the hope that the American Government will appreciate ourposition in the matter and will not think it amiss if we endeavour to carry out thetask that seems to be imposed upon its by obligations of honour. In short, if they feel unable to assist us bey^ond the point indicated, we hope that they will notdiscourage our other Allies from helping us.o
