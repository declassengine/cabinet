Mr. Chamberlain drew the attention of the War Cabinet tothe behaviour of certain sections of the populace and the army inLondon in connection with the public celebrations of the conclusionof the armistice. He stated that he understood that it had been impossible, on the previous night, to circulate the War Cabinetboxes, owing to the crowds and the manner in which soldiers and civilians commandeered vehicles in the streets. Bonfires had beenlit in Trafalgar Square, in which German guns had been burned.There was a danger that Celebrations which began in a frolic mightend in&quot;arson.Mr. Balfour said that he understood that a bonfire had been lit inPiccadilly Circus on the previous night. Without wishing to appearpedantic, he felt that every precaution should be taken.B
The Prime Minister said he understood that motor vehicles hadbeen stopped and their petrol cans taken to start the hre. Australiansoldiers had evidently taken a leading part in increasing therowdiness of some of the crowds.Mr. Long added that it was important to get the Australiansout of London as soon as possible. There had been a certainamount of trouble with them in Wiltshire. They had, for instance,forciblv removed the gates of Lord Pembroke&apos;s house at WiltonPark.Sir Eric Geddes said that on Tuesday night last he had goneround some of the principal centres affected, at 10&apos;30 p.m. Thetemper and conduct of the crowds were everywhere good. Therewas very little drunkenness, and few excesses were committed atthat hour.    Of these few, Australians were prominent participants.Sir Nevil Macready&apos; said that, although the temper of the crowd was good, there was a certain amount of hooliganism,especially in the Strand and Trafalgar Square. These excesseswere led by Colonial soldiers, mainly Australians, and young officersof the Royal Air Force. It appeared probable that the celebrationswould continue until Saturday night next. Steps had been takento stop War Office lorries going out at night, as these had been themeans of transporting large numbers of soldiers and civiliansabout the streets. The exhibition of guns in the Mall constituted a considerable danger. They might be used to barricade the streets, or be allowed to run loose down the Haymarket, or similardeclines. He had arranged with the General Officer commanding the London district to have guns picketed and the gates of theAdmiralty Arch closed at an early hour. General Sir William Robertson was going to issue a Proclamation, drawing attention tothe danger of excesses. The main difficulty was with the australians, who apparently intended to make their behaviour in cairo in 1915 a standard for future action. Steps are being takento stop leave into London. He feared that it was impracticable to stop all wheeled traffic proceeding into Trafalgar Square. Hethought that the police had the matter well in hand, and he under-took to make a further report to the War Cabinet on the following morning.Army of 2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that he under-Occupation. stood Marshal Foch was going to ask the British Government for16 infantry divisions, as well as 3 cavalry, to act as an Army ofOccupation in Western Germany. With lines of communications,this would mean the retention under Marshal Foch&apos;s command of half a million British troops in the Rhenish Provinces.The Prime Minister urged the desirability of the Army Councilworking out, as soon as possible, alternative schemes for themaintenance of the Army. They would have to consider not onlythe maintenance of the Army of Occupation, but also the retentionof the necessary garrison troops after the war. He presumed thatthe Peace Conference would take up the question of disarmament,- and that the old conscript system would disappear. Two principalalternatives which would have to be considered would be themaintenance of a small standing army, similar to the British Armybefore the war. as a police force, and the question of a nationalmilitia on the Swiss plan. Although the latter would not be fullytrained, and would be of no use as an invading army, it would be useful for purely defensive purposes. In regard to the Army ofOccupation, he thought that it was very desirable that, the ArmyCouncil should confer as soon as possible with the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer with reference to the raising of the pay of the troopsemployed in this manner, as the troops retained for this purpose would be prevented from earning high wages in industry.The Chancellor of the Exchequer feared that this might create
Turkey.(a.) Constantinople.(b.) Safety ofDowager Empressof Russia.3. The First Sea Lord reported that the Allied Fleets, under the command of Admiral Calthorpe, had arrived off Constantinople at8 a.m. on 13th November, 1918, and the British Admiral had goneashore in his joint capacity as Commander-in-Chhrfr and HighCommissioner. The First Sea Lord asked the War cabinet whethersteps should be taken by the British Fleet to secure the safety of theDowager Empress of Russia, who was now at Sevastopol, in the crimea. Her house was near the shore, and access would be easy.If the Germans left the Crimea her life would probably be in danger.He did not think it would be difficult to arrange for Her Majestybeing got off on board a British vessel without it being necessary toland a force.In view of the fact that the Dowager Empress of Russia was asister of Queen Alexandria, the War Cabinet authorised The First Sea Lord to send a telegram to the British Admiralat Constantinople, telling him to make the necessary arrangements to secure her safety and withdrawal fromSevastopol, if she so desired, but without landing a force.Holland.4. The Fhst Sea Lord read to the War Cabinet a telegram fromM. Maxse, at Rotterdam, to the effect that the German Governmenthad undertaken to send revolutionary troops to aid the Dutch ifrevolution broke out in Holland. The telegram suggested that adisplay of British naval force would assist. He could send aBritish cruiser to Rotterdam, but such a vessel would have to passcertain well-armed forts.The War Cabinet took the view that In the absence of any definite request for assistance from theDutch Government, no action should be taken for thepresent.JBoishevism.Russia, Siberia,Turkestan,Caucasia, TheBaltic States,Poland, Holland.5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew the attentionof the War Cabinet to the Minutes of the proceedings of a Conferenceheld at the Foreign Office on the 13th November, 1918, at 3&apos;30 p.m.(Appendix). The military and naval authorities had been present,and had considered a memorandum submitted by the War Office,dealing with the problem with which we were now confronted inregard to our future policy in Russia and neighbouring countries.It had been apparent that all our representatives on the spot hadfinancial difficulties, as there, would be an inevitable falling off inthe amount of war loan which would be subscribed.Mr. Balfour pointed out that the occupied enemy territories would have to pay for the support of the troops, and this wouldrelieve the burden upon the British exchequer.Mr. Chamberlain urged that the troops which would be requiredfor purposes of oversea garrisons, such as India and Egypt, shouldbe given precedence in the matter of leave.Sir Eric Geddes pointed out that it would be necessary to retain the services of a large number of mine sweepers for a considerable period, and if any increase in pay was allotted to the Army ofOccupation, similar treatment should be meted out to the mine-sweepers.The War Cabinet decided That the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of Statefor War, and the First Lord of the Admiralty should consider the question of immediately increasing the pay of men retained in the army of occupation, and of men engaged in mine-sweeping.
been inclined to undertake an anti-Bolshevik crusade. In view ofthe atrocious character of the Bolshevik Government, this was not surprising, but it was agreed that a military crusade against bolshevism was impossible, and would involve us in military opera-tions of unknown magnitude. It was still clear, however, that theGermans were using Bolsheviks in Holland and elsewhere for their own purposes ; and the Swiss Government, which had been by traditionopen to the reception of political refugees of all kinds, had been compelled to turn out Bolshevik agents. He thought it was useless to attempt anything in Great Russia, and the plan recommendedwas that we should give whatever assistance lay in our power tothose elements in Siberia and South-East Russia, who had stood byus during the war. For instance, we should recognise and supportthe Omsk Government, but there were difficulties in the way ofgiving recognition to these Governments whose tenure was ephemeral,and whose boundaries were indeterminate. In regard to Siberia,we should do our utmost to enable the Czecho-Slovaks to get home;but the attitude of the Japanese and the Americans was moreperplexing than ever.In regard to the proposal to &apos;send Canadian troops to Siberia,the Secretary of State for the Colonies stated that the canadian minister of Defence was most anxious to demobilise the Canadianforces at the earliest possible moment.The Secretary of State for War pointed out that the canadian troops referred to in the Minutes of the Foreign Office conference were a volunteer force which, at the most, would number between,000 and 3,000.   Of these 800 were there already.Mr. Balfour added that he had himself written several shortPapers, which would be circulated to the War Cabinet, in regard tothe Peace Settlement with reference to the Western Border States ofRussia. He took the view that we could not allow them to be over-whelmed by Central Russia and incorporated into Central Russia, as these States contained populations of different race, language, andreligion, and were, on the whole, more civilised and cultivated thanthe Great Russians. The danger lay in the combination of invasionand revolution. The Bolsheviks took the attitude that they did notmind about national boundaries, but insisted upon revolutionaryforms of Government. They would be content to allow7 the BorderStates to remain outside Great Russia, provided the Governments ofthose States were in the hands of Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Councils.However, all these Border States were weakened by the actualland system in vogue in those countries. In the Baltic States thereexisted a number of wealthy German barons, while further southlarge properties were held by Polish counts. The existence of thisaristocracy, which was opposed to the peasants and the great mass of the people, constituted a class division which was a source of greatweakness. In the Ukraine the small cultivator had plundered the big cultivator, and there were signs of the same policy in Roumania.The Prime Minister pointed out that, in regard to its landsystem, Roumania was one of the most reactionary States in Europe.Mr. Baifour said that he had made great efforts to get the scandinavian countries to assist in providing arms and in policingthese Border States. They had, however, all refused, and, if anything was to be done, it would have to be done by the Allies.. Lord Milner stated that, under no circumstances could we send troops.Lord Robert Cecil said that he shared the view of the foreign secretary, that it would be fatal to let it be thought that we were committed to an anti-Bolshevik crusade. He doubted very muchwhether it was part of our duty to protect Esthonia and the baltic states against Russian Bolshevism, but we ought to do what wecould to prevent the rich countries of Southern and South-EasternRussia from drifting into anarchy, and we ought to protect thepeople we have from time to time incited to help us in the war..
We had induced General Denikin to continue fighting againstGermans and to maintain a separate Government in those districtswhich were not Bolshevik. We should assist these people, not because they were anti-Bolshevik, but because they had during thewar been pro-Ally. In the Ukraine there was a pro-GermanGovernment, and it was no part of our duty to support it. Withregard to the growth of Bolshevism in Holland, he thought the ideaof sending squadrons of ships or arming prisoners of war was most inadvisable, at any rate, unless the Dutch Governmentappealed to us to do so. However, we ought to say to the Dutch,and to everybody, that, in the event of Bolshevik disturbances, weshould give them no food ; we should make this statement generally,and not apply it to any particular country ; that was to say, weshould use our control over the food supplies of the world to assistthe forces of order against disorder. In this connection, lord robert Cecil said that he was arranging for a Private notice question to be put to him in the House of Commons that afternoon,and he proposed to give an answer on the lines indicated.Mr. Balfour added that a somewhat similar answer would begiven to a question in Parliament with regard to the threatenedanti-Semitic pograms in Poland.The Prime Minister stated that he wras in entire agreementwith the Foreign Secretary as to the general line of policy to be pursued. With regard to Esthonia, he took the view that the soonerthe peasants got on to the land there the hetter, as peasants inpossession of the land would constitute a strong anti-Bolsheviknucleus. The German landowners had been a curse to the country,and had been used by the German Government as an alien garrison.Mr. Montagu drew attention to decision No. 6 of the ForeignOffice Conference referred to above, with regard to the occupationof the Baku-Batoum railway. He asked whether this proposal was put forward as an alternative to the continued occupation of theHamadan Road through Persia to the Caspian. He thought thatthe proposal to occupy Baku from the Black Sea by opening up theBatoum line would have an added attraction if it enabled us to get out of Persia altogether. He further raised the question of our policy in Trans-Caspian and Turkestan. General Malleson hadrepeatedly asked for instructions.Lord Robert Cecil thought that this matter could best besettled forthwith by a conference between the War Office and the india Office, and suggested that No. 9 of the decisions reached atthe Foreign Office Conference might be left to Mr. Montagu andLord Milner for further discussion. Lord Robert Cecil also pointedout that in Turkestan the Bolsheviks were the opposition, and wewere supporting an anti-Bolshevik Government at Askhabad.Lord Milner stated that it so happened that the countries wherethere were already in existence Governments opposed to theBolsheviks that is to say, east of the Don and the Volga were those which most closely affected the interests of the British Empireand were most easily got at. These countries were threatened by a bolshevik invasion from the west. We should help the existingGovernments to resist such an invasion, more especially as in thosecountries there were no complications due to the existence of an alien landed aristocracy.Mr. Montagu asked whether the Cabinet had accepted a principle, stated by Lord Milner, that where there was in existence-a friendly anti-Bolshevik Government which it was to our advantage to support, we should support it, and we- ought to support it, eventhough it entailed anti-Bolshevik action. Mr. Montagu said that although the Foreign Office Conference dealt with Bolshevism, it did not deal with Trans-Caspia, but that if this principle were accepted, it Avould lapply to Trans-Caspia where there was sucha Government, andj^he would then give the Government-of Indiainstructions.
The War Cabinet decided That the principle stated by Lord Milner should be accepted.The Prime Minister said that it was important that the public in England should realise more fully what Bolshevism meant inpractice. France was more secure against Bolshevism, owing tothe existence of a large population of peasant proprietors. Here wehad a great, inflammable, industrial population, and it was very desirable that our industrial population should know how industrial workers had suffered equally with the rest of the population ofRussia at the hands of the Bolsheviks.Mr. Chamberlain thought that the time had come when fullpublication should be given to the evidence which had been collected by Mr. Lockhart in regard to the behaviour of theBolsheviks.Mr. Balfour stated that the Bolshevik Government in russia had used their control of food supplies to starve to death their political opponents. The people they had treated worst were peoplewhom we should regard in this country as &quot;blood-red Socialists.&quot;The Chancellor of the Excheqixer thought that it was mostimportant that we should get the press of the country to take up thequestion of Bolshevik excesses more fully.Lord Robert Cecil stated that the. Foreign Office had a gooddeal of information on the subject which could be made available.Mr. Chamberlain added that the War Aims Committee also hada certain amount of material.The War Cabinet decided (a.) That the Foreign Office should collect as much material aspossible in regard to the behaviour of the BolshevikGovernment, and should confer with Sir George Riddelland Lord Burnham, with a view to its full and speedypublication.(o.) To approve the decisions of the Foreign Office Conference,with the exception of No. 9, which was left for decision by the Secretary of State for War, in consultation withthe Secretary of State for India.Treatment of 6- The War Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Secre-Invalided Soldiers.    tary of State for War and the Minister of Pensions (Paper G.T.-6044),in regard to the treatment of men discharged from the Army asinvalids.The War Cabinet requested-Mr. Chamberlain to take up the matter with the Departmentsconcerned, and to furnish a report on the subject.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,14t/i November, 1918.
APPENDIX.Minute of the Proceedings of a Conference held at the Foreign Office onNovember 13, 1918, at 3-30 p.m.Present :The Right Hon. A. J. Balfour, O.M., M.P. (Chairman);The Right Hon. Lord Milner, G.C.B.The Right Hon. Lord Robert Cecil, K.C., M.P.The Right Hon. Lord Hardinge of Penshurst, K G., PC.Sir George Clerk, K.C.M.G., C.B.Director of Naval Intelligence.Director of Military Intelligence.Director of Military Operations.Lieutenant-Colonel F. H. Kisch.Major Farmer.At the Chairman&apos;s request, Lord Robert Cecil read a memorandum received fromthe General Staff with regard to present and future British military policy in Russia.The Chairman observed that the memorandum raised most of the points which itwas necessary to consider. He did not think it would be possible to adhere literallyto the conclusion arrived at in the memorandum, that our troops should be withdrawnfrom Russia not later than the signature of peace : Regarding the question broadly, the Chairman enunciated the following principlesas a basis for discussion : 1. The British Government cannot embark on an anti-Bolshevik crusade in Russia.It was natural that our advisers on the spot should take a contrary line, asthey were obsessed with the external and visible violence of Bolshevism.On the other hand, the people of this country would not consent to such acrusade.2. It is necessary that support should be afforded to the border States of WesternRussia from the Baltic to the Black Sea. These States should be recognised,and support should follow on recognition.The Chairman observed that the General Staff paper took the view that theexistence of these small States on the western border of Russia would inevitably prove the object of military ambition on the part of the latter country when Russia should again become a Power. He thought, however, that the League of Nations, if it were tobe of any value at all, should be able to protect them. It had been suggested thatBolshevism was already in existence in these States, but he thought that what was really referred to was a form of agrarian revolution due to the existing systems of land tenure. Lord Milner mentioned that the clause in the armistice providing for thepolicing of these States by German troops might prove a danger in view of the break-upof moral in the German army.The Chairman, continuing, proposed action on the following lines : 1. To support the Omsk Government.2. To ensure the Czech troops in Siberia should be extricated.3. To help Denikin in South-East Russia.4. To help the small nationalities of the Caucasus.Lord Milner expressed himself in general agreement with the Chairman&apos;s remarks.He agreed entirely that we could not crusade against the Bolsheviks in countries whereBolshevism already prevailed, but he thought we should do our best to protect other[1365-502] D   .
countries from Bolshevik attack, particularly when invited to do so. Anything whichcould be done to protect the Baltic States should be done, but British troops could notbe despatched to these regions. On the other hand, considerations both of honour andof interest demanded that we should keep Bolshevism from the regions East of the black Sea, i.e., the Caucasus, the Don country, and Turkestan. It was necessary thatour military objectives should be limited. Finally, Lord Milner invited reference tothe Convention concluded in Paris on the 23rd December, 1917, deiining the spheres of the British and French activity in Russia, and urged that a similar convention was required to meet the present situation.Lord Robert Cecil was in substantial agreement with what had been said by theChairman and Lord Milner, but was not prepared to go quite so far as to say that weshould protect Border States against Bolshevik attack. Our object should be to help the Russians to stand by themselves, and we should therefore do everything possibleto support and strengthen existing organisations.   His Lordship proposed (a.) As regards Siberia : (1.) To recognise the Omsk Government.(2.) To encourage the Czechs to remain in Western Siberia.(3.) Tosend military equipment and a stall: of officers to Siberia.(4.) To send the Canadian brigade as originally ^proposed, if this can bearranged.(b.) As regards the Caucasus : We should, as was suggested by the D.M.O., establish ourselves on the wholeline from Baku to Batum.-(c.) As regards Denekin : We should help him with arms and munitions, but not troops.(d.) As regards Poland : Nothing more can be done than (as proposed in the General Staff memorandum)to furnish arms and equipment for the existing Polish formations, andto transport to Poland as early as possible the Polish troops in France.(e.) As regards the Baltic States :  ,Lord Robert Cecil still adhered to his opinion in favour of the creation of aBaltic Block, failing which, he thought we should supply arms toany local authorities which might prove themselves capable of exercising control.The D.N.I. urged that the maximum possible use should be made of our power of controlling food supplies, and mentioned that Captain Cromie in his last letter had said of Russia, &quot; the hand that feeds this country will rule it.&quot; Admiral Hall drew a comparison between European Russia of to-day and Belgium during the german occupation, and mentioned that the power which kept Belgium solidly pro-Ally wasthe Belgian Relief.The Chairman agreed in principle, but pointed out that in Belgium, the distribu-tion and control of food supplies had been possible only owing to the presence of neutral diplomatic machinery.After a short general discussion, instructions were given that the followingdecisions should be recorded : 1. To remain in occupation of Murmansk and Archangel.2. To recognise the Omsk Directorate as a de facto Government.3. To maintain our present Siberian expedition, and to encourage the Canadiansto adhere to the arrangements contemplated prior to the armistice.4. To endeavour to induce the Czechs to remain in Western Siberia, and to send out selected officers to that region.5. To approve the proposal outlined by the D.M.O., for a modus vivendi with theFrench authorities on the subject of the relations between General Janinand General Knox.
6. To proceed with the occupation of the Baku-Batum railway.7. To establish touch with Denikin at Novo Rossisk, and afford him all possible assistance in military material.8. To supply the Baltic States with military material, if, and when, they haveGovernments ready to receive and utilise such material.9. To authorise General Marshall to take over Krasnovodsk, subject to theconcurrence of the India Office.10. To adhere to  the   Convention of December 1917, if   possible, extending the British sphere so as to include the country between the Don and theVolga.o
