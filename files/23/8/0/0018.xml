Five of the British divisions had been only lightly engaged. Good progress had been madeeverywhere. Operations were continuing to-day, although the weather was bad, and the most recent reports pointed to further progress in the Foret de Mormal, and it looked as if the wholeforest would be evacuated by the Germans, who would retire to the[1365-497] B
line of the Sambre. We had captured 10,000 prisoners and 200guns, which pointed to the fact that the Germans had not contem-plated a voluntary retirement on this front.The Caucasus. 2. The Director of Military Operations stated that information had been received that the German Ersatz Guards Battalion hadbeen ordered to march from Tiflis to Berlin.Loss of H.M.S.*&apos; Campania.&quot;3.

The First Sea Lord reported that, according to the bestinformation, the &quot; Goeben &quot; was no longer in German hands, and hadbeen taken over by the Turks. It appeared, however, that some ofthe submarines had left Constantinople, probably for Sevastopol.Vote of Thanks tothe Secretary.5. Mr. Chamberlain stated that he wished, on behalf of himself and his colleagues, to pass a formal vote of thanks to the Secretaryof the War Cabinet tor the expeditious circulation of the papersgiving an account of the recent meetings at Paris and Versailles.He desired that this appreciation of Sir Maurice Hankey&apos;s services should be recorded in the minutes. sThe Prime Minister added that he welcomed such a proposal,and that, in his opinion, the thanks of the War Cabinet to theSecretary were most thoroughly deserved.The War Cabinet decided To record upon their minutes their warm appreciation of the remarkable work done by their Secretary, Sir M. Han key,K.C.B,, in producing for their information, within so short a. time and in the midst of such heavy labours, the noteswhich he had circulated of the Versailles deliberationsand conversations.The PrimeMinistersStatement.(a.) Plan of FutureCampaign.6. Thebeen held intaken placeattended byand NavalPrime Minister stated that twoFrance, dining the last few days.series of meetingsinthePrmornings ofhadFirst, meetings hada Council of War, which Lid been,the Prime Ministers, Colonel House, and the military experts ; secondly, the meetings of the Supreme WarCouncil, at which the decisions of the Council of War were hrotightup for confirmation. The reason of this was that it had been founddifficult to expedite business if all matters of detail had to bethreshed out in the presence of a large number of representatives.The War Cabinet had already received the proces-verbal of most of the meetings, and he would therefore confine his statement to the more recent developments.On the previous morning (Monday) an important meeting ofthe War Council had been held to consider the possibility of move-ments against Germany from the south. The Council had beforethem Marshal Foch&apos;s plan of campaign. He himself (the PrimeMinister) had raised three points. The first was the cutting off from Germany of the Galician and Roumanian oil supplies. Toesecond point was the importance of organising a bombing expeditionagainst Berlin. The Czecho-Slovak representative, M. Benes, had laid stress, in this connection, on the importance of making Bohemiasafe from invasion by first occupying Bohemia with a strong Allied

Marshal Foch was inclined to pooh-pooh the idea of a german invasion, on the ground that Germany had not got a suflicientnumber of troops to spare for this purpose. In this connection, themain difficulty was one of railway transport. The attack againstGermany would be, in the main, an attack against Bavaria. the nearest method of approach was through Innsbruck, but here thecountry was mountainous and extremely difficult, and it was feltthat an attack from the Boemerwald would be easier. The nextquestion, therefore, resolved itself into how it was possible to getAllied troops to the Boemerwald. It would be difficult to get troops through Hungary from the Balkans, owing to the bad condition ofthe railway between Nish and Belgrade. The other two routessuggested were, first, through Trieste. To this Signor Orlandoraised objections, on the ground that the railways leading fromTrieste to Vienna would be congested, and an attempt to transporta fresh army against Bavaria by this means might lead to confusion.The second route was through the Black Sea and Constanza, whichwould bring Roumania into active participation in the War. It was important that the War Office should consider, as soon as possible,the respective merits of these two routes.One of the most important steps taken by the Supreme Wat-Council was the uniting of the strategy of all the campaigns againstGermany under one control. It had been decided that. marshal foch should be put in command of the whole attack, so that thevarious movements might be co-ordinated. Signor Orlando hadbeen a little uneasy on this point, but, on it being made clear to him that the Italian army in Italy would not be placed under the com-mand of Marshal Foch, and would remain under General Diaz, hewaived his objections.In regard to the terms of armistice to Germany, there has beena long discussion with regard to the naval terms. Marshal Foch had opposed our proposals in the strongest fashion. Our first proposal had been that Germany should be compelled to surrender 16 dread-noughts, 12 light cruisers, 50 torpedo-boats, and 160 submarines.However, as the p-eneral feeling: had been that we were makino- itunnecessarily difficult for the Germans to agree to the armistice terms, it bad been decided that, while the 160 submarines wei e to be surrendered, the surface craft were to be interned in a neutral portselected by us, and placed under our surveillance, their ultimate fateto be decided at the Peace Conference. The German ships were tointerned without crews and ammunition, and to be put in the chargeof caretakers. With regard to their ultimate disposal, all theAllies, including the representatives of the United States of America,had agreed that none of the ships should go back to Germany. Inregard to this, America was absolutely committed, and their assentwas duly recorded. It was not proposed, however, that anythingshould be said regarding this disposal in the armistice terms.In regard to the German mercantile marine, the Prime minister stated that tie had proposed the resolution which had been sent bythe Allied Maritime Transport Council. Colonel House, however,took the view that it would be illegal if the Germans attempted totransfer their mercantile marine to neutral flags, and, at any rate,such a transfer would not be recognised by the belligerents. As oneof the conditions of the armistice laid down that the blockade shouldcontinue, the point regarding transfer could be left over until thePeace Conference, and, in the event of it being absolutely necessaryto employ the German ships in the meantime, we had this power of blockade to exercise pressure upon them to release some of the ships for use.In reply to the Home Secretary, the Prime Minister said thatthe question of the punishment of individuals guilty of crimes was left over to the Peace Conference.The Prime Minister stated that Mr. Balfour had been anxious that the Germans should be compelled, under the terms of the

Procedure withregard to armistice terms.armistice, to leave a certain quantity of arms in Poland, the Ukraine,and other Eastern areas, for the defence of those localities againstthe Bolsheviks. This proposal was rejected, he was given tounderstand, by the Supreme War Council on the previous afternoon.Mr. Hughes stated that he had addressed a letter to thePrime Minister calling his attention to a speech by the MarquessOkuma, dealing with Japanese war aims, in which he laid claim tothe possession of certain islands in the Pacific, including the Marshallsand the Carolines. He wished to repeat, on behalf of the australian government, that it would be most unfortunate if such a claim wereadmitted.The Prime Minister stated that these questions had not beendiscussed, and that the only peace terms which had been specificallyraised were those regarding the freedom of the seas and indemnities the former because it was included in President Wilsohs FourteenPoints, and the latter because it was omitted. The Prime minister had made it perfectly plain that we were unable to accept theproposals regarding the freedom of the seas, and that, if necessary,we should continue to fight alone rather than give way upon thispoint.In regard to all our peace terms, the proposal was to have an inter-Allied Conference, which President Wilson would himselfattend, before the Peace Conference, and at this Inter-allied conference he hoped that the Dominion Governments would berepresented.Lord Robert Cecil stated, in reply to Mr. Hughes, that he had recently circulated a paper to the War Cabinet regarding the claims and commitments to Japan. This paper showed that no stepswhatever had been taken without full consultation with, and theapproval of, the Australian Government.The Prime Minister stated that, although Japanese represen-tatives had attended the Supreme War Council, they had never raised the question of the colonies. With regard to the colonies, hehad discussed the matter fully and frankly with Colonel House, andhe had told him, at their rirst private interview, that under noconditions would we consent to any of the colonies being returned toGermany ; and, further, that we could not consent to the surrender of any colonies conquered by the Dominions, but were preparedto discuss what should be done with the remainder.With regard to the Allied terms of armistice with Germany,they were undoubtedly very stern. They included the occupation ofbridgeheads over the Rhine, to bring under control not only all the rhine cities, but also important cities like Cologne, Frankfort,and Mannheim.He had asked Marshal Foch whether he thought that theGermans would accept these drastic terms. Marshal Foch had replied in the negative, but added that he would be able tooverpower the enemy in any case by Christmas.From recent telegrams it would appear on the surface that opinion in Germany was hardening against peace. However,M. Clemenceau was of opinion that this view was purposely circulatedby the Germans, and concealed the real position, and that in factGermany was not hardening.Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig had taken a prominent part inall their discussions. He whs at first in favour of the less stringentarmistice terms which he had put forward to the Cabinet in London ;hut, in view of the fall of Turkey and Austria, he bad modified his view, and he was in general agreement with the proposals putforward by Marsha1. Foch.With regard to the communication of the armistice terms toGermany, the  terms would  be  sent,   in the first  instance,   to president Wilson, together with a warning regarding our reservations concerning the freedom of the seas and indemnities.   If he approved, President Wilson would then intimate to the German

The FourteenPoints.Government, via Switzerland, that, on their sending a parlementaireunder the white flag to General Foch, the latter would communi-cate the Allied armistice terms to the German representative. if no parlementaire were sent, the proposed armistice terms would not published.The Prime Minister asked the Director of Military Operations toprepare, for the War Cabinet, a map showing the effectof the proposed armistice terms. This map should not be circulated, but a copy hung in the Cabinet Room.Mr. Hughes laid stress on the importance of entering a caveatin time that the Fourteen Points were not our Terms of Peace.Speaking for himself, he declined to be bound to the chariot-wheelof the Fourteen Points, particularly those dealing with the Leagueof Nations. He would not be a party to a League of Nations until he knew exactly what was meant by it.The Prime Minister pointed out that the Peace Terms were not limited by the Fourteen Points, but by ail the addresses that president Wilson had delivered since January 1918, inclusive, and,having been carefully through them, he could not find a single point which we wanted that was not amply covered, with the exception ofthe points regardino- the freedom of the seas and indemnities, andof our position in regard to these matters notice had been dulygiven.The Prime Minister pointed out that it had been necessary togive a certain amount of discretion to Marshal Foch and the british admiral, in connection with the execution of the terms of armistice,to deal with relatively minor questions of detail, such as time, thatmight emerge.Exchange ofPrisoners of War.7. The Home Secretary asked whether anything that had beendecided at Versailles prevented the ratification and continuedworking of our arrangements made at The Hague in regard to theexchange of prisoners with Germany.The Prime Minister replied that nothing of the kind had been raised, and it was important that we should proceed with the carrying out of the Agreement, and that no details such as thequestion of submarine crews should stand in the way.Message of congratulation tothe Government ofIndia.8. With reference to War Cabinet 496, Minute 7, the Secretaryof State for India submitted a draft telegram conveying the con-gratulations of the War Cabinet to the Government of India on theoccasion of the conclusion of hostilities with the Ottoman Empire.(Appendix.)The War Cabinet approved the draft telegram.Propaganda in 9. The Director of Military Operations stated that a telephoneEnemy Countries. message from General Headquarters had been received, asking forthe views of the Army Council with regard to the utilisation ofLord Northcli!fe&apos;s statement of our war aims, which had appeared in&quot;The Times&quot; of the previous day, as propaganda among german troops serving on the Western front.The War Cabinet decided that This was a departmental matter, and Lord Northcliffe was entitled to use whatever he thought most suited for thepurpose of propaganda. -2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,November 5, 1918.
