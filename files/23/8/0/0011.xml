Peace andArmis- 1. The   War   Cabinet  had   before  them   a  telegram   fromtice Proposals: Mr. Barclay, Washington (No. 4788), dated the 23rd October, 1918,President Wilson&apos;s giving President Wilson&apos;s reply to the last Note from the GermanEeply to Germany.   Government regarding peace and armistice (Appendix).The Prime Minister stated that he welcomed the terms of the reply, and liked the tenor of President Wilson&apos;s proposals.. if germany meant peace she would accept, and the acceptance wouldbe equivalent to military surrender. If, on the other hand, theGermans want to continue the war, they would now be compelled tocontinue the war upon a refusal to accept the armistice terms pro-posed by the Allies jointly. He was most anxious to avoid a breakdown of the negotiations on the diplomatic platform. he wished to see the matter placed in the hands of Marshal Foch andthe Allied Commanders-in-Chief. If a breakdown occurred under such circumstances, there would be no break in public opinion or inthe Army, as it would be clear that the breakdown was due not tothe action of political and diplomatic chiefs, but to the refusal by theGerman military authorities of the terms of armistice required bythe military chiefs. The diplomatic wrangle was now over, and thePresident had made it clear that the terms of the armistice would be such as to prevent the resumption of hostilities by the Germans.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that the president had telegraphed through Sir Eric Geddes that he (eared that theAllies would impose humiliating terms in the armistice. Now,however, the President had himself put forward demands whichwere humiliating, and practically amounted to unconditional surrender.In regard to the actual terms, the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff thought that we could give to the Germans the same terms as were given by the Germans to the French garrison in Belfort in1870, namely, the honours of war.Lord Reading stated that the President had now done what theWar Cabinet had wished him to do. The moment had now arrivedwhen President Wilson had stated that he would communicate withthe Allied Governments, and he had made it clear to the GermanGovernment that the terms of armistice would be such as would prevent the Germans resuming hostilities.&apos;Mr. Chamberlain drew attention to the concluding passage inthe Presidents reply, which seemed to suggest that he would require,as a first condition, the imposition of further changes in the GermanConstitution. He reminded the Cabinet that nothing embitteredFrench opinion more than the interference by Germany in Frenchinternal politics between 1870 and the outbreak of the present war,notably the demand for the dismissal of M. Delcasse.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that he was apprehensive lest the Note would be construed as meaning that thePresident: demanded unconditional surrender if he were dealing withthe Hohenzollerns, but that if he were dealing with a Constitutionalregime the Allies were prepared to grant easier terms.The Prime Minister thought that apprehension need not be feltupon this point, as, in the first part of his Note, the President had made it clear that, even in dealing with a Constitutional regime inGermany, the terms of the armistice would be such as would amount in practice to military surrender.Mr. Chamberlain pointed out that there was no question ofdifferent armistice terms, but a distinction was drawn in regardto the ultimate peace terms.Mr. Balfour stated that the inherent power in the GermanConstitution still remained with the Council of Empire(&quot; Bundesrat&quot;), which had not yet been touched.Mr. Chamberlain pointed out that the sole value of a democraticConstitution in this connection lay in the fact that no country with a democratic Constitution could prepare and scheme for war through along series of years, but that a democratic Constitution was no
2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that theIHrd and Ivth  Armies had captured over 8,000 prisoners and100 guns on the previous day. The 1st Army, under General Home,had joined in the attack that morning, and reports showed that everything was going very well. In front of the Ivth  Corps theGermans had run away. In answer to Mr. Chamberlain, who askedwhether it was true that 30 German divisions were now opposed tothe American divisions in the Meuse district, General Wilson statedthat we had identified at least 27, but that one of these german divisions had a total bayonet strength of 785. This was one of themost remarkable pieces of evidence we had regardiug the decline in strength of the German armies.The Italian Front 3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that theItalian offensive had begun. Two armies, namely, the Ivth  andXllth, had attacked on the previous night, and two more armies,namely, the with and Xth the latter of which was under the command of General Cavan were to attack to-night. In all,36 divisions and 5,500 guns were being engaged in this attack. the weather was fine, and the Piave was falling. Important results mightbe expected if the attack was successful.Mesopotamia. 4. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that ouradvance up the Tigris had now reached the neighbourhood ofKirkuk, without encountering any opposition. We were, however,still about 130 miles from Mosul.Palestine and o. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that he hadSyria.seen General Shea,, who had just returned from Palestine, wdierehe had commanded a division. He had said that there was nownothing in front of General Allenby to prevent him reaching Aleppoand Alexandretta. General Shea had stated that the Turks had cut the throats of the Germans in Damascus, and that the only Germanswho escaped were those who had surrendered to the British.Mr. Balfour recalled that he had seen a report that a traincontaining Turkish, German, and Austrian officers, proceeding fromAleppo to Constantinople, had been stopped by the Turks, and thatthe Turks had taken out the German officers, stripped them, andflogged them, but had spared the Austrian officers on the groundthat the latter were in the same boat as the Turks and were their fellow-victims.Mr. Chamberlain thought that such information should be givenwide publication, especially by wireless, in order to show theGermans how they were now hated by their Allies.The War Cabinet requested The Assistant Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to arrangefor the publication of such information in this country, andThe western front.guarantee that a Parliament or Government would not suddenlydeclare war. Mr. Chamberlain drew attention to a telegram from lord Derby (No 1299), dated the 23rd October, 1918, dealing with thearmistice proposals, and said that he presumed that the use of the word&quot;military&quot; hy the French Government meant &quot; naval and military.&quot;He was very anxious that there should be no misunderstandingon this point.Further discussion on this subject was adjourned until thereceipt of President Wilson&apos;s official communication tothe Allied Governments.
Australian &apos;Divisions inFrance.to furnish the information to the Ministry of information and to Lord Northcliffe, for publication abroad and in enemy countries.6. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported thatGeneral Lawrence had informed him that there were difficulties inregard to the employment of Australian divisions in the presentfighting. The Australians had been pulled out of the line for arest, and Mr. Hughes had given them to understand that they hadbeen pulled out for a long rest. The Commander-in-Chief wishedto put them into the line again at once, and General Lawrencefeaxed that if this were done there might be trouble among them.On the other hand, if the Australians were not put in, there wouldbe trouble with our troops. The Australian divisions had had morerest that the British troops.Mr. Long thought that the facts should be brought to theattention of the Australian Ministers now in this country, and tothe General in Command of the Australian base in England.The Secretary pointed out that Mr. Hughes had been asked toattend this Meeting of the War Cabinet, but was away speaking inthe provinces.The War Cabinet decided that- -The Secretary of State for the Colonies should keep in touchwith the Chief of the Imperial General Staff on thesubject, and, if General Sir H. Wilson could not reach asatisfactory arrangement after seeing General Monash,Mr. Long should use his discretion in asking Mr. Hughesto return at once to London.The Coal Situation. 7. The President of the Board of Trade said that a demand hadThreatened Strike been made by the Miners&apos; Federation of South Wales for a shorterin South Wales. working day for surface workers in the mines in South Wales. Atthe present moment the men working below ground worked an-hours day, but the men above ground worked an 11-hours day with an interval of 1-J hours for meals. The South Wales Miners&apos;Federation was demanding an 8-1-hours working day for surface workers, while the Hopkins&apos; Union was asking for an 8-hours day.The colliery owners in South Wales had been consulted and had refused to agree to this change, pointing out that it was in violation of the agreement arrived at, which provided for no change in working hours during the War except by mutual consent. TheCoal Controller had held meetings with the miners&apos; representatives,who had told him that this demand must be met, as they would otherwise be unable to control the men, and that the men would goon strike. A Conference was being held in South Wales that day,and Sir Guy Calthrop had asked the representatives of the minersto take no definite step at this meeting, to which they had agreed,and he proposed to go there himself on the following day and meetthe Conference. Sir Albert Stanley pointed out that the Miners&apos;Federation of South Wales had asked the British Miners&apos; Fede-ration to raise this question, but they had refused, and left it to each district to put the demand forward if they thought fit to doso. There were constant demands of a similar nature being putforward by other districts, in Scotland as well as in England. this demand, if acceded to, would not only mean a reduced output ofcoal, but must undoubtedly spread to other industries. A similarposition had arisen a year ago with reference to a section of the railway-men, who had demanded an 8-hours day, and on that occasion theWar Cabinet refused to agree and had proclaimed the strike, but a promise was given at that time that sympathetic consideration withregard to shortening the working hours would be given after the
cessation of Hostilities. Sir Albert Stanley was hopeful that itwould be possible to come to some arrangement on similar lines, and suggested that the Coal Controller should endeavour to induce theminers to refer the whole question to the British Miners&apos; Federation,and that the War Cabinet should authorise Sir Guy Calthrop togive a pledge on behalf of the Government that within six months from the conclusion of peace it would undertake to bring about such areduction and re-arrangement of the hours of surface workers atcollieries as would ensure that their normal shift should not exceed8-g- hours, including 20 minutes for mealtime. Sir Albert Stanleyexpressed the opinion that it was very advisable that this pledgeshould be given by the Government. The position was undoubtedlyserious, but he was hopeful that a settlement would be arrived aton these terms.In reply to questions, the Coal Controller said that he hadinterviewed the Chairman of the Miners&apos; Federation of South Wales,who had told him that the men were quite out of hand and that theFederation had to decide whether or not to support the strike. Itwas quite clear that the intention of the men was not so much to cut down the amount of coal mined, but to increase overtime pay.Sir Guy Calthrop expressed the opinion that the President of theBritish Miners&apos; Federation would be willing to accept the proposalindicated by Sir Albert Stanley, as, by doing so, the whole question would come within the control of the Federation of Great Britain,and he would be able to deal with it in accordance with the pledgewhich he had given to the Prime Minister. If the question were referred to the Miners&apos;Federation of Great Britain, it would beimpossible for any strike to take place for a fortnight, as a confer-ence of all the coalfields must he called, and, if this offer were made,the arguments in favour of a strike would be greatly weakened.Sir Adam Nimmo agreed that the chances of a strike wereremote if this proposal were adopted. In the first place, the policy involved in the whole question would be centralised, which wouldbe a decided advantage to the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain,and, in the second place, a definite pledge would have to be givenby the Government that an 8^-hours day had practically been con-ceded, and this would be a great advantage from the point of viewof the Federation. Moreover, Mr. Smillie had already, in anothercase recently dealt with, stated openly that, if the demands in respect of wages in that case were met, the difficulty of hoursmight be got over, as he recognised that during the War the difficultiesof readjusting hours were great, and that there was reasonable ground for postponing this question until after the War. It would serve no useful purpose only to say, as had been said in the case of therailway workers, that sympathetic consideration would be given - tothis demand within three months after the War, as this position was evidently not acceptable to the men, and in any case sympathetic consideration involved concession.With regard to the colliery owners, while they were not likelyto be unanimous in accepting this proposal, there was a generalrecognition of the fact that hours of surface workers at the collierieswould require to be considered immediately after the War, and SirAdam Nimmo&apos;s view was that this pledge by the Government wouldnot carry the industry further than many coal owners believed theywould require to go. after the War.In reply to a question as to what the effect of a strike at thepresent time would be, the Fourth Sea Lord said that the Navy had sufficient coal in reserve to carry on for about fourteen days.The Shipping Controller pointed out that mercantile shipping would be stopped at once.The Minister of Munitions said that, although his Department
had no reserves of coal, there would be no difference in the supplyof munitions to the Army for a considerable time.The War Cabinet decided that The President of the Board of Trade should be authorised tomake the following pledge on behalf of the Government: The Government undertakes to bring about within sixmonths from the conclusion of Peace, such a reduction andre-arrangement of the hours of surface workers at collieriesas will ensure that their normal shift shall not exceed8 hours 30 minutes, including 20 minutes for mealtime,with the necessary elasticity to meet emergencies and other essential work in the spirit of the Coal Mines RegulationAct, 1901, provided the hours of persons at present working less than the normal shift as denned above shallnot be interfered with.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,2Uh October, 1918.
APPENDIX.Mr. C. Barclay to Mr. Balfour. -(Received October 24.)-(No. 4788.)   En clair. Washington, October 23, 1918.FOLLOWING is reply of United States Government to German note : -&quot; Having received solemn and explicit assurance of German Government thatit unreservedly accepts terms of peace laid down  in  his address  to   congress of United States on 8th January,  1918, and principles of settlement enunciatedin his subsequent addresses, particulaidy address  of  27th September, and thatit   desires   to   discuss   details   of   their application,   and   that   this   wish   and purpose emanate, not from those who have hitherto dictated German policy andconducted present war on Germany&apos;s behalf, but from Ministers who speak formajority of Reichstag and for an overwhelming majority of German people, and havingreceived also explicit promise of present German Government that humane rules ofcivilised warfare will be observed both on land and sea by German armed forces,President of United States feels he cannot decline to take up with Governments withwhich United states Government is associated question of armistice.   He deems it his duty to say again, however, only armistice he would feel justified in submitting forconsideration would be one which should leave United States and Powers associatedwith her in position to enforce any arrangements that may be entered into, and tomake renewal of hostilities on part of Germany impossible.   President has thereforetransmitted his correspondence with present German authorities to Governments withwhich United States Government is associated as belligerent, with suggestion that, if those Governments are disposed to effect peace upon terms and principles indicated,their military advisers and military advisers of United States be asked to submit to governments associated against Germany necessary terms of such an armistice as willfully protect interests of peoples involved, and ensure to Associated Governmentsunrestricted power to safeguard and enforce details of peace to which GermanGovernment has agreed, provided they deem such armistice possible from military-point of view.   Should such terms of armistice be suggested, their acceptance byGermany will afford best concrete evidence of her unequivocal acceptance of terms and principles of peace from which whole action proceeds.   President would deemhimself lacking in candour did he not point out in frankest possible terms reason why extraordinary safeguards must be demanded.    Significant and important asconstitutional changes seem to be, which are spoken of by German Foreign secretary in note of 20th October, it does not appear that principle of Government responsible to German people has yet been fully worked out or that any guarantees eitherexist or are in contemplation that alterations of principle and practice now partiallyagreed upon will be permanent.   Moreover, it does not appear that heart of present difficulty has been reached.   It may be that future wars have been brought under control&apos; of German people, but present war has not, and it is with present war that we are dealing.   It is evident German people have no means of commanding acquiescence ofmilitary authorities of Empire in popular will; that power of King of Prussia to controlpolicy of Empire is unimpaired ; that determining initiative still remains with those whohave hitherto been masters of Germany.   Feeling that whole peace of world dependsnow on plain speaking and straightforward action, President deems it his duty to say,without any attempt to soften what may seem harsh words, that nations of world donot, and cannot, trust word of those who have hitherto been masters of German policy,and to point out once more that, in concluding peace and attempting to undo infiniteinjuries and injustices of this war, United States Government cannot deal with anybut veritable representatives of German people, who have been assured of genuineconstitutional standing as real rulers of Germany.    If it must deal with militarymasters and monarchical autocrats of Germany now, or if it is likely to have to dealwith them later in regard to international obligations of German Empire, it mustdemand not peace negotiations, but surrender.   Nothing can be gained by leaving this-essential thing unsaid.&quot;
