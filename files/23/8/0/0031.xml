]. WITH reference to War Cabinet 509, Minute 1, the WarCabinet had a further discussion in regard to the railway situation.The Prime Minister said that the country was again confronted with the danger of a serious strike, arising out of the old quarrelbetween the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Fire-men and the National Union of Railwaymen. Fie had seen Mr. J. H.Thomas on the previousThursday, who had said that he would supportthe Government if they took the line that they could not give an answer to the question until after the General Election. It now appeared,however, that Mr. Thomas was not in a position to fulfil his promise.Mr. Thomas and Mr. Bromley insisted on obtaining an answer that day. The question was one of redeeming a promise given on behalfof the Government by Mr. Barnes and Sir Albert Stanley (referredto in War Cabinet 507, Minute 1) that the question of reducing thehours of labour would be considered by the War Cabinet within amonth of the cessation of hostilities. Mr. Thomas and Mr. Bromleywere demanding an eight-hours day for both Unions.The Prime Minister pointed out that public opinion alsodemanded an eight-hours day for these men. The public were coming to the conclusion that it was a question not whether the men could stand the physical strain of a longer day, but that the workingclasses were entitled to the same sort of leisure as the middle classes;The workmen said that they were not going to be working machinesbut that they reqivired time to enjoy life as well. The demand wasone for more human conditions for the working classes, and it was ademand which, in view of public opinion, would be very difficult to resist.The President of the Board of Trade said that he agreed withthe Prime Minister that it would be difficult and unwise to resist thedemand. In this instance, the railway leaders were acting well within the above-mentioned pledge, given in August 1917, on behalfof the Government. He had tried to induce the railway leaders to postpone the question until after the General Election, but he hadnot been successful in doing so. Mr. Thomas was willing enough,but he could not set Mr. Bromley to agree.The Prime Minister suggested that while the eight-hours daymight be adopted as a general principle, perhaps it might be possibleto make exceptions in the case of certain classes of railway-men,such as those who worked in parts of the country where there wasvery little traffic.Sir Herbert Walker said that such a proportion of the workers would amount to about one-fifth.Sir Albert Stanley said that if an attempt were made to exclude&apos; the one-fifth from the general principle, it was extremely probablethat the rest of the Union would stand by the one-fifth.Sir Eric Geddes agreed with Sir Albert Stanley in this respect.Sir Albert Stanley said that while he would try in his negotiations to exclude the one-fifth, at the same time he did not wish to let thematter become the ground for a general strike. He added that thecost of establishing the eight-hours principle would amount to about twenty to twenty-five million sterling.In this connection Lord Curzon pointed out that the question was bound up in the larger issue of the nationalisation of railways,and Sir Herbert Walker added that, apart from State control, therailway companies under normal conditions would never have con-ceded the eight-hours principle, because they could not afford it.Such an increased cost as 25 millions would involve an increase of something like 40 per cent, on the goods rates, and from a com-mercial point of view it could not be justified.The President of the Board of Trade agreed that the Englishrailways, apart from&apos; State control, could not possibly meet thedemand, as indeed they were already bankrupt without this increasedburden.
1Sinking of H.M.S.Cassandra,&quot;2. The Deputy First Sea lord reported that a message hadbeen received to the effect that H.M.S. &quot; Cassandra,&quot; while proceedingfrom Libau to Reval, had struck a mine and had sunk. The crewhad been taken off by destroyers, and the names of eleven menmissing, probably killed by explosion, were being transmitted by wireless telegraph.Clothing andEquipment for theEussian Armies in siberia.3. With reference to War Cabinet. 477, Minute 15, the WarCabinet had before them a memorandum by the Chief of] theImperial General Staff (Paper G.T.-6421) in which he asked forthe sanction of. the War Cabinet to, the despatch of equipment,clothing, and general ordnance stores for a further 100,000 menin the Russian armies in Siberia ; this was to include the provisionof such guns as could be spared up to 200.The War Cabinet gave their sanctionChief of the Imperial General Staff.to this proposal of theMedicalExamination, on demobilisation ofMen serving in theArmy.4. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of National Service (Paper G.T.-6394T in regard to theMedical examination, on demobilisation, of men serving in thearmy.The War Cabinet referred, this question to be decided byMr. Chamberlain.The Prime Minister said that, although the English railways,apart from State control, might not have agreed to grant the demand,at the same time they might have been forced by Act of Parliamentto do so, as had happened in the case of granting terms to the minersbefore the war.Sir Eric Geddes showed that this increase of 25 millions nowadded to an increase of 50 millions already granted since the war,was equivalent to an increase in wages of something like 150 percent., and was in excess of concessions to any other classes ofworkers, but the Prime Minister pointed out that the wages ofagricultural labourers had trebled.Sir Albert Stanley said that there was another aspect of thecase, namely, that of the Irish railways, which were in a hopelessfinancial position, and could not possibly justify the eight-hours dayprinciple. He doubted whether the railway Unions would carry theissue to the point of a strike if the Irish railways were not included,but it would be very difficult to exclude them. He would do his best,however, to keep the Irish railways out of the proposals.The War Cabinet were unanimous in their opinion that thepresent demand of the Unions for the establishment of the eight- -hour principle could not be resisted, though they were aware thatthe whole question might be raised again later on.The War Cabinet decided that The President of  the Board of Trade  in his negotiation^,with the Onions should agree to accept the principle wthe eight-hours day, making the   best arrangements hecould in the case of the percentage of workers in those parts of the country where traffic was very light, and alsoin the case of the Irish railways.He should announce that a Committee would be set up afterthe General Election with powers to investigate thewhole question in regard to the conditions of wages and service of men engaged upon the railways; and that aseparate Committee should be set up to deal with the caseof Ireland.
Demobilisation and 5. The War Cabinet had before them an Interim Report by theReconstruction Demobilisation Committee (Paper G.T.-6277) together with the Com-behemes. mittee&apos;s Supplementary Report (Paper G.T.-6277a), making certain recommendations with regard to Demobilisation and ReconstructionSchemes.General Smuts said that the finance of these schemes had beenapproved by the Treasury, and all that was now needed was Cabinetsanction in order that the schemes might be put in hand at once.The War Cabinet agreed to the proposals made by the Demo-demobilisation Committee in their Interim and SupplementaryReports (Papers G.T.-6277 and 6277a respectively), and requested General Smuts to see that the schemes were put intc operation at the earliest possible moment.6. The Prime Minister said that the position of releasing menfrom the army was very unsatisfactory as far as he could gather.We had in France an army of 2,000,000 men, and at the outside300,000 of these men were required for the army of occupation inGermany. He Avould like to know what steps were being taken inorder to demobilise the remainder at the earliest possible moment.General Smuts said that authority had been given for demobi-lisers and pivotal men to be released up to the number of 150,000.This number was in addition to the coal miners ordered to be released.The Prime Minister said that in spite of the fact that authority had been given for the release of these men, his information wasthat this was taking place only in very small numbers. If thesemen could be brought home, peace industries could be startedimmediately.Sir Stephenson Kent said that he considered that the limiting factor in regard to this matter was the transport in France.Exclusive of the sick, wounded, and men on leave, only 700 menwore being brought home each day. The scheme of demobilisationlaid down that the men in the army at home should be demobilisedat the same rate and, as nearly as possible in the same numbers, asthe armies abroad. This was only fair, as it would cause a greatdeal of dissatisfaction to the men who had served in the trenches ifthey imagined that the man at home was being demobilised beforethem, and could, further, obtain the pick of employment.Lord Weir said that the Air Force desired to demobilise as quickly as possible. Their officers had no men to command, andtherefore very little to do, which was the worst thing possible forthem. On his own responsibility he had demobilised the Air Forcecadets. He only wished to keep airmen in proportion to the needs ofthe two services.General Smuts said that an agreement had been arrived at with :the Army Council by which officers and men who had pre-war employ-ment waiting for them, or whose training had been interrupted, shouldbe demobilised at the earliest possible moment, in addition to thepivotal men.Sir Stephenson Kent drew attention to the fact that the Ministryof Labour had only had permission to set up the machinery forreleasing the pivotal men at the end of October, and the n^mes ofthe pivotal men required by the different employers were only justbeginning to come in now. We had suffered from endeavouring tokeep down the peace atmosphere of the nation until the armisticewas signed.(At this point the Adjutant-General entered.)The Adjutant-General said that since the 11th November50,000 men had been demobilised in this country and in France.In addition to this number 50,000 prisoners of war had been dealtwith  at  the  dispersal  centres.   The armistice had come  very
102DonatiW7&apos; Gerieral Srrmts stated that the Demobilisation Committee had&apos;   &quot; &apos; that morning discussed the question of an increase to the Out-of-WorkDonation. Very strong representations had been made that thepresent rate was not sufficient. The Committee on Production had approved an increase of 5s. a week to men remaining in industry.This strengthened the case for increasing the unemployment benefit.The Demobilisation Committee had come to the conclusion that arise in the Out-of-Work Donation was necessary, but they were ofopinion that the amount should be determined in consultation withthe responsible Labour Organisations in order that they shoul sharewith the Government the responsibility.The War Cabinet decided that Subject to the concurrence of the Chancellor of the Exchequer,an increase in the Out-of-Work Donation should be given.The amount of such a rise to be determined by the Ministryof Labour in consultation with the responsible labour organisations, but that it should not exceed 5*.fa^lLue o?nCBl 8&apos; Sir S* Kent Sakl tllat he hoped some statement would bePriority Licences made by the Government with regard to etting industries upon a peace basis. At the present moment a good deal of the Labourunrest was due to the fact that manufacturers were timid of manufacturing large stocks until they knew they had a market forthem.Dr. Addison said that he understood that the trade had plenty of orders which they could execute as soon as licences affectingmaterials were withdrawn.Mr. Symonds of the Local Government Board said that SirA. Geddes had nearly completed a new housing scheme. One ofthe proposals was that the various articles required for houses,such as doors; window frames, &amp;c, should be standardised,and that the Government should buy stock and sell such standardisedsuddenly, and the civilian and military demobilisation departments had consequently not been immediately prepared to commence. demobilisation. An immense amount of work was necessary beforethe dispersal stations could be opened, and he considered that the demobilisation Department had done exceptionally well in passingso many men through their machinery in the last three weeks. the dispersal stations would be opened on the 9th instant, and demobilisa-tion would then proceed with greatly increased rapidity.In reply to a question, the Adjutant-General said that out of150,000 miners in the army, 15,825 had been demobilised since the11th November. The reason wdiy the men were being releasedslowly was that it took time to find out the names of the men to be demobilised and to get them out of the ranks. Another greatdifficulty was transport. Marshal Foch had issued an orderrestricting the use of rolling-stock. He thought, however, that bythe 15th of this month they would be able to work up to demobilising5,000 miners a day.The Prime Minister said that during the crisis in March of thisyear we had been able to ship over to France vast numbers of menin a very short space of time, and it should be possible to demobilisemen at a much quicker rate than we were doing at present. Hewas afraid that the people in France-were placing obstacles in theway of releasing the men.The War Cabinet decided that The Demobilisation Committee should have authority to dealwith the question, and should have full powers to giveorders on behalf of the War Cabinet.
articles.   Already Local Government Board experts were in negotia-tion with the manufacturers in regard to this matter.The War Cabinet decided that The Demobilisation Committee should be given power to canceltrade licences, when and where they thought fit.Post War priorities committee.9. It was pointed out that in consequence of the decisionrecorded in the fpregoing minute, the functions hitherto exercised by the Post War Priorities Committee would cease to be operative.It was therefore decided that The Post War Priorities Committee should cease to exist, andthat its duties and functions should devolve on the Demo-demobilisation Committee.Service men andthe GeneralElection.10. The War Cabinet had before them a resolution passed bythe Naval Parliamentary Committee with regard to Service menand the General Election (Paper G.T.-6406). The resolution read asfollows: That this Committee demand the abolition of all Regulationsaffecting the Soldier, the Sailor, or the Marine, insomuch asthey may place unfair restrictions on him, and that these menmay be placed upon the same footing as the civilian duringthe present Parliamentary Election.Dr. Macnamara suggested that the following reply should besent to the Secretary of the&quot;Gommittee : &quot; Parliament has given the Soldier and Sailor the vote,and the Government of course desire that every facility shallbe given to them to exercise the franchise, and to inform them-selves how to exercise it with information and knowledge. Tothis end it has been decided that N.C.O&apos;s and men may attendpolitical meetings in uniform. But if they wish to stand ascandidates, act as agents, speak in public, or in any other way take an active part in the prosecution of any candidature,they must do so not in uniform. The request in your letter,that the decision of the Admiralty weekly order, namely, thatfavourable consideration shall be given to the request of any man for permission to wear private clothes, shall be made the rule for all the Services, is agreed.&quot;The War Cabinet approved of the above letter, and instructed the Secretary to communicate it to the Secretary of the NavalParliamentarv Committee.Processions of munition Workersin Whitehall.11. The War Cabinet approved of the instructions which theHome Secretary had issued to the Commissioner of Police withregard to Processions of Munition Workers. According to these instructions, while the crowding of Richmond Terrace and downing street was to be prohibited, deputations which Ministers or officials had consented to receive might pass. No endeavour was to be madeto prevent orderly processions in Whitehall, but any attempt to holdmeetings there should be suppressed.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,December 6, 1918.o
