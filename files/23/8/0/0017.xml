Ormsby Gore, M.P., Assistant Secretary.Captain Clement Jones, Assistant Secretary.The Western Front. 1- The Director of Military Intelligence gave a description ofthe operations on the Western front since Friday, the 1st November.On that day the 1st American Army and the Ivth  French army had launched an attack which had developed on an 18-mile front and had penetrated about 12 miles. The Germans were retiringwithout much fighting. The Allies had captured 5,000 prisoners,mostly on the 3rd November, and about 100 guns.At Valenciennes, on the 1st November, the IHrd and IVthBritish Armies had attacked on a 10-mile front and had penetrated4 miles. They were now 3 miles beyond Valenciennes, and had captured 2,000 prisoners. To the north, between the Lys and the scheldt, the British Hnd Army had penetrated 10 miles, and were now in the outskirts of Ghent.A telegram had been received that morning to the effect thatour 1st, ILIrd, and Ivth  Armies had attacked from the north-east of Valenciennes to Oisy, and that the French were attacking fromOisy to south of Guise, on a front of 30 miles.   No details had yet[1365-496] B
2been received, but the attack appeared to be going satisfactorily.Le Quesnoy had been taken.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he understood thatthis attack was one of the most important operations of all that had yet taken place.The Director of Military Intelligence, in reply to a question,said that, -while it was not expected that any large body of german troops would be cut off, the importance of the attack was due partly to the locality in which the operations were taking place, and partly on account of the scale on which they were being conducted. Itwas almost certain that, for reasons of man-power, the germans would be obliged to evacuate Belgium, although they might perhapspause first on the Antwerp--Namur line.In this connection, the Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff saidthat all the German merchant ships which had formerly been atAntwerp had now proceeded to Dutch ports, chiefly Rotterdam.The L hector of Military Intelligence stated that the number of enemy divisions had decreased from 192 to 186. This reduction wasaccounted for by the fact that one German division had beendisbanded, and five Austrian divisions had gone out of the fighting.The Italian Front. 2. With regard to the terms of armistice, which were to take effect that day from 3 o&apos;clock, the Chancellor of the Exchequer saidthat, at the request of M. Clemenceau, no announcement would bemade in the Houses of Parliament that day, because the FrenchChamber was not sitting. The statement would be made, probably by the Prime Minister, on the following day. Mr. Bonar Law said it was a matter for consideration whether it would be necessary to read all the geographical details of the terms of armistice.The Director of Military Intelligence explained, by means ofa map, the line to which the Austrians would retire under thearmistice.The Director of Military Intelligence undertook to furnish aparaphrase of the geographical description of the terms of armistice, which could be used in the public statement inthe Houses of Parliament.Macedonia: 3. The Director of Military Intelligence reported that a FrenchConstantinople.        regiment had sailed from Dedeagatch to the Dardanelles, and thatthe 28th British division was embarking at Salonica for the samedestination.Admiral Fremantle said that officers had landed on the gallipoli Peninsula on the 2nd November, in order to makepreliminary arrangements for the occupation of the forts. It was expected to land 6,000 ti troops on the 6th November. Mine-sweepingoperations were now in progress, and it was hoped that the AlliedFleet would go up the Dardanelles on the 9th November. admiral calthorpe proposed to anchor in Constantinople, in the first place,and then proceed to the Gulf of Ismid until it was certain thatthere were i o enemy submarines in the Sea of Marmora. Anunconfirmed report had been received that the &quot; Goeben&quot; and fourGerman submarines were in Turkish hands. If this report weretrue, the British iEg. an squadron would probably be sufficiently strong for tie operations contemplated in the Black Sea without theassistance of any Fre nch or Italian ships. The French and italian ships would proceed to Constantinople, but it was not yet clear whether they intended to follow Admiral Calthorpe into the black sea. It was proposed to send one small monitor to Smyrna, and inaddition we were asking the Italians to release from the Adriatic
&quot;Commander-in- 4. The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to the request of chief in the General Milne that a, Commander-in-Chief should be appointed toDardanelles. command the Allied forces in the Dardanelles.The Director of Military Intelligence said that this question was being discussed at Versailles with the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff.Mesopotamia. 5. The Director of   Military Intelligence reported that twocavalry brigades were close to, and had probably by this time arrived at, Mosul. 11,000 prisoners and 50 guns had been captured.With regard to the situation at Baku, 1,500 men were required,and it appeared from General Marshall^ telegram that they couldbe there in a fortnight; but arrangements would have to be made toreplace the brigade thus withdrawn, for the protection of the Reshtdistrict. There was a question whether the best way to Bakumight not be via Batoum. As to any fear that the oil wells mightbe destroyed, it was pointed out that the destruction of the wellswould be resisted by the local people, who obtained their subsistenceby working them.Message of Con-congratulations toGeneral Marshall.6. With reference to War Cabinet 494, Minute 4, the Directorof Military Intelligence read to the War Cabinet a message of thanks which had been received from General Marshall in reply tothe congratulations of the War Cabinet.Message of Con-congratulations to theGovernment ofIndia.7. The Secretary of State for India referred to the wrar effort of the Government of India in regard to recruiting and material,and more especially to the great assistance rendered by GeneralMuuro. He asked that the War Cabinet should authorise him tosend a message of congratulation to the Government of India ontheir behalf.The War Cabinet requested -The Secretary of State for India to prepare a message of con-congratulations, for decision on the following day, after thePrime Ministers return.Submarines. 8. Admiral Fremantle said that during the last three weeksthree enemy submarines were definitely known to have been sunk.As regards submarine operations in the North Sea, it was believedthat all enemy submarines were returning, and no further hostile action had been reported.The Imperial War 9. Mr. Long stated that he had received  a   telegram   fromCabinet: Dominion Canada stating that, in view of the war situation, Sir RobertMinisters. Borden proposed to sail for England as soon as possible, and wouldprobably leave irr about a week&apos;s time. From South Africa he had learned that General Botha was expected to leave Cape Town onthe 8th November, and would be in England early in December.Mr. Montagu asked whether, in view of the re-assembly of themembers of the Imperial War Cabinet, it would not be advisable to summon the Indian representatives.[1835-496] B one of the British light cruisers, which were working under theItalian Command.
Mr. Chamberlain thought that it was. very desirable Sir S...Sinha should be summoned as soon as possible.Mr. Long thought that it would be very necessary to decide atan early date who were actual members of the Imperial WarCabinet. The arrival of General Botha would mean that SouthAfrica would have two representatives, while Mr. Hughes and SirJoseph Cook were both in this country representing Australia.The other Dominions might therefore seek double representation.The War Cabinet decided that The Secretary of State for India should send a telegram to theViceroy, urging the attendance in this country of Sir S.Sinha, on behalf of the Government of India, in connec-tion with the preparations for the Peace Conference.The Supreme War 10. The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that, in view of council. the Prime Ministers early return, he did not propose to make ageneral statement in regard towhat had happened at Versailles duringthe last few clays. He would, however, like to state that two mattersof importance had not been decided when he had left Versailles.First, the military terms regarding an armistice with Germany hadnot yet been finally agreed ; and secondly, the definition of the phrase &quot; The Freedom of the Seas&quot; had not yet been determined.In regard to the first, the terms proposed were even more stiff thanthose originally suggested by Marshal Foch. They included the holding of bridgeheads over the Rhine, with a radius of 30 miles onthe east bank, and the Allied occupation of certain cities, such asCologne. The naval demands were still under discussion, and aquestion had arisen with regard to the possible surrender of certainships and the internment of the remainder. It was felt that such a distinction would be liable to misinterpretation by the public, both here and in Germany, and either all should be surrendered or allinterned. The Americans had made it quite clear that they didnot contemplate the return of any warships to Germany as part ofthe Peace Terms.Mr. Chamberlain asked whether any decision had been come to with regard to merchant shipping.The Chancellor of the Exchequer replied that proposals regardingGerman merchant   shipping were  comprised under the head of&quot; Reparation.&quot;   It was not considered practicable that the german merchant ships should be handed over to the control of the allied maritime Transport Council, as a condition of the armistice.In regard to American representation, the Chancellor of theExchequer stated that Colonel House had not attended Versaillesas a plenipotentiary, and that his assent was always subject to president Wilson&apos;s decision.Propaganda. 11. Lord Robert Cecil stated that, owing  to  the  vacancyoccasioned by the resignation of the Minister of Information, ColonelBuchan had been to see him with regard to the desirability of some general statement being made in regard to our present attitudetowards the new German Government and the German people. he gathered that the Ministry of Infor-mation attached importance tosome statement being made on this subject at an early date.The War Cabinet decided that No action was necessary.Government Build- 12. The War Cabinet had before them a letter from the Secretarying and Con- of the War Priorities Committee (Paper G.T.-6143) recommendingsfcructional Work.     that the only Government Departments which should be empoweredto undertake building or constructional work should be the Admiralty,
Proposed dissolution-tion of the Gom-mittee on Unem-ployment due to^Restriction ofIndustries.13. The War Cabinet had before them a minute from theSecretary of the War Priorities Committee (Paper G.T.-6L60), inwhich the President of the Board of Trade, who had acted as chairman of the Committee on Unemployment due to Restriction ofIndustries, appointed by the War Cabinet in January 1918, askedfor the authority of the War Cabinet for the dissolution of theCommittee. The work formerly undertaken by the Committee had now been absorbed by the larger Committee appointed by WarCabinet 491, Minute 1, and there appeared to be no good grounds for the continuance of its functions as a separate Committee.The  War   Cabinet   approved   the   course.   President of the Board of Trade.proposed  by theGovernment Em-ployees whoseParents are notnaturat-bornBritish or AlliedSubjects.14. With reference to War Cabinet 444, Minute 7, the WarCabinet had before them a copy of correspondence between the CivilService Commissioners and the Treasury in regard to the arrange-ments as to the suspension from employment in government service, during the war, of Government employees whose parentsare not natural-born British or Allied subjects (Paper G.T.-6100).The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that he had given thisquestion his personal attention, and he thought that a clear case hadbeen made out for amending the Government decision in regard tothe non-employment in Government service of any person whoseparents were not natural-born British subjects in cases where theindividual in question had served during the war in His Majesty&apos;sarmed forces.The War Cabinet approved the proposal made by the CivilService Commissioners in their letter dated the 23rd Sep-tember, 1918 (Paper G.T.-G100),and directed The Secretary to call the attention of all Departments concerned to the decision.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,November 4, 1918.othe War Office, the Ministry of Munitions, and the Air Ministry,and that the duty of carrying out work for other GovernmentDepartments should be entrusted to the Office of Works.Colonel Byrne stated that there was no opposition to thedecision of the ad hoc Committee, appointed by the Chairman of theWar Priorities Committee, on the part of any GovernmentDepartments.The War Cabinet approved the recommendations of the Chair-man of the War Priorities Committee.
