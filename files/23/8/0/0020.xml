THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that marshall Foch had laid out the route by which the Germanparlementaires would approach the Allied lines. The road by whichthey would come was almost exactly at the junction between theBritish and French positions. In all probability the Germanparlementaires would arrive there that afternoon. The germans would then have seventy-two hours, or until Sunday, the 10th Novem-ber, in which to decide whether to accept or reject the terms of armistice. In reply to a question, the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff said that, from a purely soldier point of view, there did notappear to be any actual need yet for the Germans to accept theterms. They were falling back, but it was not certain whether theirretreat was that of heavy formations or of rear guards. If they lost[1365-499]
Mutiny at Kiel. .    2. The Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff reported that themutiny at Kiel was developing along the whole line of the Canal, andalso in the Third Battle Squadron, which was in the Baltic. Itappeared, however, that the Commander-in-Chief of the High SeasFleet did not think that all hope of restoring order had gone.Syria. 3. The Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff said that admiral calthorpe had been instructed to inform the Turkish Governmentthat Alexandretta must be surrendered to General Allenby by a date to be named by him, otherwise the town would be occupied by force.The Dardanelles. 4. The Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff said that the 28thDivision would probably embark at Salonica on the 7th Novemberfor the occupatian of the Dardanelles forts. The evacuation of turkish troops from the Dardanelles area had commenced, but wouldbe slow, owing to lack of transport. Mine-sweeping operations wereprogressing.Mesopotamia. 5. The  Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff said that admiral calthorpe had been instructed to inform the Turkish Governmentthat Mosul must be evacuated under clauses 7 and 20 of the Termsof Armistice, by a date to be specified by General Marshall.Aerodrome in 6. The War Cabinet had.before them a letter from the SecretaryBohemia. of the Air Ministry to the Secretary of the War Cabinet (paper g.T.-6218), in regard to the establishment of a base in Bohemia foraerial operations against Germany. It was pointed out, in the letter,that highly important results would accrue from the employmentagainst moral and industrial targets in Germany of as large a portionas possible of the aerial forces now released from Palestine andSalonica, operating from bas es in Bohemia, preferably in thevicinity of Prague. It was requested that sanction might be givenfor definite arrangements to be made by the Chief of the Air Staff,in consultation with the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and marshal Foch, for carrying this suggestion into execution at the firstfavourable moment.The War Cabinet approved the proposal contained in the letterfrom the Air Ministry.Re-afforestation. .- 7. With reference to War Cabinet 455, Minute 15, Mr. Barnesstated that, in. order to carry out the decision of the War Cabinet,Mr. Aclaud has advised Lord Curzon and himself that it would bedesirable to set up an interim authority pending the passage of aGovernment measure to give full effect to the War Cabinefsre-afforestation policy. He understood that the Treasury proposedthat afternoon to introduce in the House of Commons a supplementary estimate placing the necessary funds at the disposal of such interimauthority, and the formal sanction of the Cabinet for its establishmentwas now required. Mr. Acland would act as chairman, and a numberof gentlemen, who were experts in forestry, had intimated their willingness to serve.Mfeieres within the next two or three days, there would then bemore likelihood of the terms of armistice being accepted.At a later stage in the meeting news was received that american troops were already in the outskirts of Sedan.
The War Cabinet decided (a.) To approve the setting up of an. interim afforestationauthority to make certain necessary preliminary arrange-ments for developing afforestation in the United Kingdom.(b.) That, until legislation has been passed, the interim authority should work in close touch with the Departments con-cerned, who, in the event of differences of opinion, wouldhave a right of appeal to the Cabinet.Kestoration of Pre- 8. &quot;With  reference to War Cabinet 49 L, Minute 2, the war war Practices Bill.    Cabinet had before them a revised draft Bill, with a covering note byDr. Addison (Paper G.T.-6209).General Smuts said that the Demobilisation Committee had given some consideration to the subject of the Governments warpledges to the trades unions, and, on the whole, had been in favour of introducing the revised draft Bill and then referring the matter to a select Committee of the House of Commons. They were advised that, without some such procedure, it would be impossible to makeany real headway with reconstruction, and that, at any moment afterthe signing of an armistice, they might be confronted with seriouslabour troubles.Mr. Chamberlain said that the Demobilisation Committee hadlooked at the problem from the standpoint of civilian industry. Inthe event of an armistice, it would become necessary gradually toreduce the production of munitions, and, in order to keep unemploy-ment at an minimum, factories now engaged on war w-ork would haveto be diverted to civil production. The Government was pledged notto employ dilutees except on war work, and thus friction would immediately arise. It w-as understood that the responsible Labourleaders recognised that the literal fulfilment of the pledges would be disastrous. On the other hand, they pointed to the Governmentspromise, and wished to be put in a position to bargain with theemployers and to have their authority with their own men confirmed.He gathered, too, that leading employers were in favour of .a BiUbeing passed, and were then prepared themselves to negotiate future arrangements with the trade unions. He thought, therefore, thata Bill ought to be tabled and referred to a Select Committee, inorder to keep the matter an open question.Mr. Bonar Law said that it would be impossible to refer thematter to a Select Committee in the event of a General Election.Mr. Montagu said that the pledges definitely referred to theemployment of dilutees on war work. It was significant that withinthe last few clays an Executive Committee, representing a largenumber of womens organisations, had passed a resolution unani-mously asking for the restoration of pre-war practices.Mr. Barnes said that he very much preferred the new Bill to its predecessor. It was much simpler, and well within the pledges, andhe thought it would be advantageous to pass it.Sir David Shacklet m said that in August 1917, certain clauseshad been withdrawn by Mr. Churchill when amending the Muni-tions of War Acts, and a promise had been definitely given thatthey would be subsequently introduced.- Already there were signsof industrial trouble, owing to the Governments delay, and he himself was in favour not only of introducing a Bill but of passing it.The Prime Minister said that the question deeply affectednearly 2,000,000 women, and if the literal fulfilment of the pledgeswere insisted on, many of these women would be involved in veryserious hardship. He thought the suggestion of a Select Com-mittee was a good one, but he was against referring the matter to a select Committee before a General Election.   The pledges given by
the Government were quite specific, but what the War Cabinet hadto consider was whether or not the Bill should be brought in beforethe war was ended, and, incidentally, before a General Election.No time would be gained by simply introducing a Bill and referringit to a Select Committee which would not be able to come to adecision before a Genera! Election. Further, in such circumstances it would be said that the Government were not sincere in their intentions, and had simply introduced the Bill at the last moment,knowing that they would not be able to pass it. There was nothing in the pledges which made it obligatory on the Government tointroduce a Bill before the end of the war. The conclusion ofan armistice did not necessarily end the war, and, as the Chief of theImperial General Staff had stated, there was nothing in the militarysituation, taken by itself, to show that the end of the war wasnear. He therefore suggested that the Government should announce that, as there were greater prospects of the war coming toan end sooner than there had been hitherto, the Government hadbeen considering how best to give effect to their pledges, and hadalready considered two draft Bills. Owing, however, to the difficultyof the question, they proposed to set up a Royal Commission, onwhich there would be representatives of women workers, to considerthe whole position.Mr. Montagu stated that three courses appeared to be open tothe War Cabinet: (a) to proceed by a Select Committee, (6) by a royal Commission, or (c) to pass the Bill. He suggested that itwould be well to consult the persons to whom the pledges had beenmade, as to these three courses.Mr. Long thought that the Government might find itself in a difficulty if the trade union representatives at the proposed conference were unanimously in favour of passing a Bill.Mr. Balfour said that it would be possible for the Prime Ministerto explain to the proposed Conference the military and the Parlia-mentary situations, that no advantage would be gained in introducing a Bill and not passing it, and that, therefore, the Bill would in anycase have to be a post-Election Bill.Sir George Cave reminded the War Cabinet of the agreements which had been made with the sanction of the Government atthe Home Office.The War Cabinet decided (a.) That the Prime Minister, accompanied by Mr. Balfour andSir George Cave, should, at the earliest possible opportunity-nity, confer with the Labour representatives who hadbeen parties to the Treasury Agreements of 1915 ;(6.) To approve the amended reply to a Parliamentary question on the subject, prepared by the Leader of the House, and submitted to the War Cabinet.2, Whitehall Gardens, 8.W.,November 7, 1918.o
