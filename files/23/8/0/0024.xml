1. WITH reference to War Cabinet 502, Minute 2, the Directorof Military Operations stated that, although no official proposals hadbeen received, he understood that Marshal Foch was likely to ask that thirty British divisions should be allowed to remain as part ofthe army of occupation.The consideration of this question was adjourned until theSecretary of State for War could be present, at a later stage of the meeting (see Minute 6).Murmansk.f 2. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theDirector of Military Operations, calling attention to the situationwhich had arisen at Murmansk owing to difficulties over food andcurrency for the civilian population, and enumerating the steps whichhad been taken by the War Office to meet this situation (paper g.T.-6302).General Radcliffe stated that the more immediate needs at murmansk had been already dealt with, but that supplies of meat and lard were required for the civilian population, and particularly for the railwaymen, in order to prevent mutinous action againstGeneral Maynard&apos;s force. There were no resources at Murmanskbeyond what we had sent there. Although responsibility for pro-visioning Murmansk had been undertaken by the Americans, theyhad done nothing in the matter.The War Cabinet decided that The War Office should discuss the situation with the Ministryof Food, the Ministry of Shipping, and General Poole, and put forward definite proposals for the consideration of theWar Cabinet.Mission to South 3. General Radcliffe asked for the approval of the War CabinetRussia. to the sending of General Poole on a special mission to South russia to report on the actual situation there, especially the position ofGeneral Denikin and the Don Cossacks. It was not intended thatGeneral Poole should take any executive action or that he shouldprompt any such action, but solely that he should obtain first-handinformation as to the facts and then return. &apos;The War Cabinet decided To approve the despatch of General Poole, subject to theconditions indicated by the Director of Military Operations.Army of Occupa-tion.Naval Armistice. 4. The First Sea Lord stated that the arrangements connectedwith the naval armistice were proceeding satisfactorily. The GermanAdmiral had met our Commander-in-Chief at Rosyth, and it hadbeen arranged that the surface vessels should leave Wilhelmshavento-morrow (Tuesday) night and meet our fleet on Thursday morning,i The German fleet would proceed to Rosyth for inspection and thenbe taken to the place of internment. Similar arrangements were proceeding with regard to submarines.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs stated that, afterconsultation with the Admiralty, he had sent a telegram to theSpanish Government with reference to the internment of theGerman Fleet, but no reply had yet been received.German Mercantile 5- The First Sea Lord stated that the Ministry of ShippingShipping. wished to make   arrangements with  regard to the use of  theGerman mercantile marine, and it was suggested that the allied maritime Transport Council should draft the conditions under whichthese ships should sail.   It was intended to use these ships under
licence \ for the conveyance of food to enemy countries, and inother ways.The First Lord said that the arrangements could be carried outby the Board of Admiralty, who were sending a Commission toWllhelmshaven in connection with the armistice, and the Ministryof Shipping would be asked to appoint representatives on theCommission.The War Cabinet authorised The Admiralty to make the necessary arrangements in thismatter, in consultation with the Ministry of Shipping andthe Allied Maritime Transport Council.Army of Occupa-tion :Status of general milne.6. The attention of the War Cabinet was called to a telegram which had been received, indicating that orders had been given byGeneral Franchet d&apos;Esperey for British troops from General Milne&apos;command to occupy Vienna and Budapest. Apparently GeneralFranchet d&apos;Esperey was under orders to proceed to these cities, andthe action contemplated was being taken without consultation withHis Majesty&apos;s Government.It was pointed out that such action would be interpreted in thiscountry as an interference on behalf of a particular form of government,that there would be opposition in Labour circles, and that it wouldelicit a protest from the public, Avho were anxious to see the soldiersreturn home at the earliest possible moment. No representationshad been made that the advance proposed was necessary in order toenforce the terms of armistice, and it was most undesirable that weshould let ourselves be dragged into a selfish exhibition by any of our allies.The Director of Military Operations referred to the status of General Milne, and the desirability of making his commandindependent of the French command.The Secretary of State for War said that he was strongly opposedto involving the British troops in the Central European operationsunless it was necessary in order to preserve order, but there was no necessity whatever for the Allies to be called upon to preserve orderin Vienna and Budapest.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said he feared thatthese projects of the French Government were likely to cause trouble.There were already signs of trouble in another quarter, between theItalians and the Serbians. In his opinion, the proposed advanceinto Austria-Hungary was a matter for Allied decision, and if adecision were given in favour of the advance, then the British army should be represented, even if only by a small contingent. Hethought it probable that the French would argue that the enterprisewas a military operation required&apos; in the interests of the effectivecarrying out of the armistice, and that it was entirely under thecontrol of Marshal Foch.The War Cabinet decided that The Secretary of State for War, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, should send atelegram to the French Government (a) seating thatGeneral Milne could not be allowed to send troops withthe proposed expedition to Vienna and Budapest ;(6) that His Majesty&apos;s Government had learned of theproposal with surprise, and wished to know what objectsit was intended to serve ; (c) asking for information asto the number of troops Marshal Foch was likely torequire as - the British contribution to the Army ofOccupation.
8. The War Cabinet had before them the following Memo-randa : Memorandum   by the  Secretary  of State for  War   (paper g.T.-6151),Supplementary Note (Paper G.T.-6151 a),Memorandum from the Admiralty (Paper G.T.-6171),Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Air Porce(Paper G.T.-6232),Memorandum by the Minister of National   Service   (paper g.T.-6236).     &apos;The First Lord stated that all three Services needed thesanction of the War Cabinet and of Parliament to retain men with the colours for a period beyond the duration of the war andto recall men to the colours in the event of remobilisation becomingnecessary within a period of at-least two years after the terminationof the War.Lord Milner said that, while large numbers were returning to civil life, it would be necessary to offer compensatory attraction tomen whom it was desired to retain in the Services.The War Cabinet decided that A- Bill should be prepared for submission to the War Cabinet bythe Secretary of State for War, in consultation with theFirst Lord, the Secretary of State for the Air Force, andthe Minister of National Service, to give effect to therecommendations set forth in their respective Memoranda.DemobilisationPolicy :(a.) Personnel.(6.) Future of recruiting.Post-War Overseas 7. The War Cabinet had before them a Joint Memorandum byGarrisons. the Secretary of State for War and the Secretary of State for India(Paper G.T.-6292), and a Memorandum by Lord Derby (Paper G.T.-3465), dealing with proposals to call for volunteers from the presentarmies to engage for short terms of service after the war.Lord Milner stated that the matter had been fully considered bythe Army Council, in consultation with the India Office, and it hadbeen decided to ask the War Cabinet for authority to invite 150,000men for service in the overseas garrisons, together with sufficientmen to find the necessary drafts, on the terms set forth in the Memo-randum. The terms provided for the offering of bounties and furlough,and his only doubt was whether the terms were . sufficiently attractive.   The bounties would be in addition to the usual gratuities.The Adjutant-General&apos; stated that it was proposed that themen should carry their existing war rates of pay and separation allowances, and a bonus in lieu of passage home would be offered tomen who preferred it. The precise amount had been fixed inconsultation with the Viceroy, who thought that perhaps 30,000 men could be obtained on the terms proposed.Lord Weir stated that the Air Council would like similar arrangements made for any airmen it was found desirable tomaintain in India and the Colonies.It was suggested that some modification might be made of thescheme of bounties and furlough offered under Section 4 (2), forexample, by omitting the extension for- one year, by adding an inducement to stay for a fourth year.   The War Cabinet decided -(a.) To approve the proposals put forward by the secretaries of State for War and India, and authorise them to make such modifications as they thought necessary in theterms of the bounties.(6.) To authorise the Secretaries of State for Tndia and the air to conclude similar arrangements for volunteers ingarrisons abroad.
Increase of Pay to soldiers and sailors:Payment of gatuities.Prorogation ofParliament:The King&apos;s Speech.Pensions and party politics.Press Censorshipt9. With reference to War Cabinet 498, Minute 1, Mr. Barnesreported to the War Cabinet the conclusions reached by the Soldiers&apos;and Sadors&apos; Pay Committee on the subject of the payment of gatuities (Paper G.T.-(328G). Mr. Barnes stated that the committee recommended that a distinction should be drawn between men whohad served in the &quot;theatre of war&quot; and others. Those who had remained at home would be paid on a lower scale. Care had beentaken to exclude from benefit conscientious objectors and men whohad served less than six months in the Army. With regard to menwho had been brought back to work in munition shops, but who hadnot been discharged from the Army, it was not proposed to give them gratuities for the period served in the shops. The total cost ofthe scheme would be about 80,000,000L It would be retrospective,and the widows of men who had fallen would benefit under thescheme. The money would be paid through the post offices, wheremen would be given books in which they would find the sums due tothem credited to them. Slips would be attached showing how themoney could be invested in War Bonds. Mr. Barnes, in reply to aquestion, stated that the Committee had decided that it wasadministratively very difficult to attempt to distinguish -men whohad been sent overseas for a short time only and had then returnedwithout seeing any fighting.The War Cabinet decided (a.) To ask the Committee to reconsider the question of menwho had been overseas for a short time only, with a viewto some differentiation against them being made ;(b.) Subject to the above, the recommendations of the Soldiers&apos;and Sailors&apos; Pay Committee were approved.10. The War Cabinet approved a Draft Speech for submission to His Majesty the King and to the Privy Council, for delivery byHis Majesty on the occasion of the Prorogation of Parliament.11. The War Cabinet had before them a letter from Sir C.Montague Barlow, K.B.E., M.P., to Mr. Bonar Law, suggesting theformation of a Select Committee of the House of Commons to dealwith questions of Pensions policy and administration (paper g.T.-6284).Mr. Bonar Law said that the matter would come up as a parliamentary Question on the following day, and the proposal ofSir Montague Barlow, if adopted, would lead to somethingresembling the French Committee system.It was pointed out that there were many complaints of the way in which pensions were administered, and that it was probably thisdefective administration that was largely responsible for the agitationto set up a Select Committee.The War Cabinet decided that In reply to the Parliamentary Question, the Leader of theHouse should say that, if the present Government bereturned to power, it proposes to set up a Committee toexamine in what way the administration of pensions canbe best assisted and grievances removed.12. The First Lord stated that the Board of Admiralty wishedto relinquish the naval censorship as from Wednesday, the20th November, 1918.The War Cabinet gave their approval to this proposal.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,November 19, 1918.o
