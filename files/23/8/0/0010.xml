2Correction of 1. WITH reference to War Cabinet 488, Minutes 1 and 2, rheMinutes. War Cabinet decided that-The record in draft Minutes 1 and 2 of War Cabinet 488, of a discussion on preparations for an eventual Peace Oon-ference, should be abbreviated and incorporated in a singleminute, since the discussion had been of a preliminary-character and did not lend itself to precise and accuraterecord.2. With reference to War Cabinet 488, Minutely the WarCabinet decided that The name of Sir Albert Stanley should be added to the Com-mittee, and that full Cabinet authority should be given toMr. Chamberlain to decide upon the recommendations ofthe Committee without further reference.The Western Front. 3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that theGermans were falling back from the Belgian coast to the line of theriver Lys. This involved the occupation of Bruges by Allied forces.He explained, with reference to a map, the strategical conception of the plans of operation now being put into execution by the british army. General Wilson said that the best German divisions hadbeen brought both from the north . and south of the line to resistGeneral Rawlinsoids attacks. Very heavy fighting had taken placeon the previous day, and was continuing.Post-War disposalof Surplus G-overn-ment Property.Trans-Caspia. 4  Xhe phief of the Imperial General Staff stated that, fromtelegrams received from General Malleson, it appeared that our forces had received a check in the neighbourhood of Kaakha.Lord Curzon said that our main object in this theatre had been achieved, namely, the prevention of a Turkish or German advanceacross the Caspian. Any fighting in Trans- Caspia was now of purely local significance.5. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff drew the attentionof the Cabinet to a telegram which had been received from Archangel(No. E. 672/G), dated the 17th October, stating that the Frenchinfantry battalion at Archangel had been seriously affected, by thepossibility of an armistice on the Western front. The americans had informed our Commander that, in the case of an armistice, theywould not fight offensively. This raised the whole question as to our future military policy in Russia in the event of an armistice with theCentral Empires.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs stated that, in theevent of an armistice with Germany, we were faced with a seriousstate of things in Russia. The main justification of our interventionhad been to prevent German aggression and absorption of thatcountry. Mr. Balfour drew attention to Joint Note No. 38 of theMilitary Representatives at Versailles, and said that President wilson had always taken a very strong line, that he was unwilling toparticipate in the re-constitution of the Eastern front, and that russia must be permitted to work out her own salvation without interference. He had only consented to intervention in Siberia inorder to enable the Czecho-Slovaks to get out of Russia throughVladivostok. If we now withdrew our forces from European andAsiatic Russia we should suffer a serious loss of prestige, and shouldbe letting down our friends. The American Military representative at Versailles had taken up a very definite attitude in regard to american participation in Russia, and had made it quite clear thatthe United States of America would have nothing to do with it.
Mr. Chamberlain stated that, in view of the American attitude,it was most urgent that we should have a military and diplomaticexchange of views with the French regarding our future policy inRussia in the event of an armistice. The French took the view thattheir old relations with Russia and their interests in that countrygave them special rights and privileges. It now appeared that theFrench Battalion at Archangel would not fight in the event of an armistice with Germany. It was therefore necessary that theFrench Government should be approached with a view to arriving at a common decision in regard to future policy.General Smuts said that, before the Allies could have an armistice with the Central Powers, they must be clear aboutpolitical and military questions in Russia. Bolshevism was a danger to the whole world, and we were already committed at Murmansk,Archangel, and in Siberia.Lord Robert Cecil said that there were two big Prussianquestions which demanded immediate consideration : 1. The question of the small Baltic States which had been created by Germany as the result of the Peace of Brest-Litovsk.2. The question of intervention in Russia.He hated the idea of abandoning to Bolshevik fury all those whohad helped us, but he quite saw that it might end badly if we tried to destroy Bolshevism by means of military interference. he pointed out that Japan was also concerned, as well as France. Hethought that nothing was to be gained by consulting France untilthe British Government had agreed upon its policy. In view of thepossibility of a British fleet entering the Black Sea, it was important that w^e should know what was the present position of GeneralAlexieffs forces in Cis-Caucasia.The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought that it would help the Cabinet to come to a conclusion if a joint memorandum by theForeign Office, the War Office, and the Admiralty could be drawmup regarding the present position and our future policy in Russia.Mr. Chamberlain hoped that such a memorandum would containdefinite propositions for the Cabinet to accept or reject.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The Foreign Office should send a telegram to Lord Derby,asking him to draw the attention of M. Clemenceau tothe attitude taken up by the French battalion at archangel, and requesting him to take steps to deal withthe situation ;(b.) The Foreign Office, in consultation with the Chief of theImperial General Staff and the First Sea Lord, should prepare a Paper on the subject of our present and future military policy in Russia.Ostend, 6. With reference to War Cabinet 488, Minute 4, the deputy first Sea Lord reported that the Vice-Admiral, Dover, had landed atOstend at l-30 p.m. on the 17th October. The town was found to be. evacuated by the Germans, but an 11-inch shell had fallen in thetown shortly after the Admiral had landed. A Flushing telegramreported that all the buildings on the Belgian coast between Ostendand the Dutch frontier were on fire, and a series of explosions hadbeen heard.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that such fires,could be of no military advantage, and that, if the report were true,,the action of the Germans was mere vandalism.
ASubmarines. 7. Admiral Hope stated that there had been no diminution of submarine attacks during the last few days, and there was no sign ofa practical response in this respect to President Wilson&apos;s note.An enemy submarine had been attacked near Hartlepool with success. 18 depth charges had been exploded, and the resultsseemed to point to the submarine having been destroyed.Message of Con-congratulations to theKing of the belgians.8. With reference to War Cabinet 483, Minute 5,-the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff read a draft telegram congratulating theKing of the Belgians on the success of the Allied forces acting under his command.The War Cabinet decided, subject to the approval of the PrimeMinister, that The Foreign Office should send this telegram to the King of the belgians through the Belgian Government.Anti-aircraft defence of theUnited Kingdom.9. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theChief of the Imperial General Staff (Paper G.T.-5999), covering aletter from the Air Ministry, with regard to the anti-aircraft defenceof the United Kingdom.General Ashmore said that he would like the War Cabinet tounderstand that, after the additional three squadrons referred to inthe memorandum had been sent to France, the establishment for london Air Defences would be short to the extent of forty machines.He said that the third squadron could be prepared shortly, and thatthe two additional squadrons, mentioned in the memorandum, couldbe formed at intervals of two months. This could be done withoutfurther reducing the strength of the. London Air Defences. He also pointed out, with regard to the possibility of air raids being madeagain on this country, that there was no physical reason why such attacks should not take place, even if the enemy were forced toretreat beyond Ghent. General Ashmore stronghy pressed that theten balloon aprons should be retained. He pointed out that theyhad an important influence in restricting the enemy machines to highaltitudes, where they could be dealt with by our aircraft. Further,the number of &quot; A &quot; or &quot; B 1 &quot; men that would be set free by theirreduction was limited.General Smuts concurred with General Ashmore.The War Cabinet approved of the proposals contained in theMemorandum, except for the proposals in regard to balloonaprons, which it was decided to retain.Disposal of SurplusAnimals on De-mobilisation.10. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for War (Paper G.T.-5871) in regard to thedisposal of surplus animals on demobilisation.In the memorandum reference was made to a pledge given byMr. Lloyd George, when Secretary of State for War, on thel&apos;/th October, 191(5, on the subject of selling old war horses to theEasterns.The War Cabinet asked The Secretary of State for War to decide this question in thebest way possible, and to submit his decision for the PrimeMinisters approval, in view of the pledge referred to above.
Importation of 11. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theOnions. Food Controller (Paper G.T.-5985) in regard to the importation ofonions from Spain.In the Memorandum it was stated that, owing to the com-parative failure of this years home onion crop, the small Spanishcrop, and the insuperable difficulties in the way of securingsufficient tonnage to import other foreign onion crops, it had become necessary to control the prices of both home-grown a,ndimported onions.The Treasury desired to see private purchases stopped, in viewof their effect upon, the exchange, and the sanction of the WarCabinet was accordingly asked to the prohibition of the import ofonions except under licence.The War Cabinet approved of the proposals contained in theFood Controllers Memorandum.Haw Materials. 12. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for the Colonies (Paper G.T.-5909) in regard toraw materials.In the Memorandum a proposal was made that a Committee ofMinisters should be appointed to consider, with the departments directly concerned with the supply, during the war, of each of the raw materials referred to in the resolutions of the Imperial war conference, what action was necessary to provide that the necessarysupplies should, in fact, be available for the United Kingdom afterthe war, and arrange with those Departments for such administra-tive action, beyond what had already taken place, as was necessaryto secure such supplies.A letter was read from the President of the Board of Trade,who was unavoidably prevented from attending, in which he expressed the view that the matter should be referred to theEconomic Defence and Development Committee for decision.It was pointed out, however, that Mr. Long&apos;s proposals werestrictly in accordance with the procedure outlined in WarCabinet 429, Minute 15, for the Trade Belation Committee and theEconomic Defence and Development Committee. Also, in view ofthe fact that Mr. Chamberlain had consented to become a memberof the new Committee, the co-ordination between the two bodieswould be complete.In these circumstances,The.
