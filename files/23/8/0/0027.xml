The western front.Surrender of theGerman high seas Fleet.1. THE Director of Military Operations said that he had nothing&apos;to report from the Western or any other front.2. With reference to War Cabinet 505, Minute 4, the deputy first Sea Lord said that the ships surrendered by Germany for internment should have arrived at Scapa Flow by Tuesday next.The ships were being sent in batches from Firth of Forth to ScapaFlow. Fifty-nine submarines out of a total of 120 to be surrenderedhad already reached Harwich; one of these had sunk en route, the crew being saved. A German destroyer had also been sunk by aGerman mine on its voyage across the North Sea.Dardanelles Corn-mission :Question of givingWitnesses Copiesof their ownEvidence.Number of officials from each Govern-ment Departmentto be detailed forthe PeaceConference.Preparation ofBrief for PeaceConference.3. The Secretary said that he asked for the decision of the WarCabinet in regard to a matter of principle. He had received a letterfrom General Birdwood, asking if he could be supplied with a copyof the evidence he had given before the Dardanelles Commission.Sir Maurice Hankey said the position was that, since the commission had suspended its sittings, the documents had been handed over tohim for custody. The contention of General Birdwood was thatevidence given by a witness could hardly be held to be secret fromthat witness.In the course of a brief discussion, in which it was suggested thatthe Commissioners should be approached on the subject, it was pointedout that the publication had been withheld by order of the WarCabinet, and the present question was, therefore, one for theCabinet&apos;s decision alone.The War Cabinet authorised TheSecretary to communicate to any witness before theDardanelles Commission who might ask for it, a cope&apos; ofhis own evidence, on the distinct understanding that itmust be treated in every respect as a confidential Govern-ment document.4. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he wished toraise the question of the number of persons to be detailed from each government Department for attendance at the Peace Conference, asTreasury sanction was required. &apos;The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the approximate number of persons whom it was proposed the several departments should send to Paris for the peace negotiations were:the Foreign Office, 17 ; the War Office, 40 ; the Admiralty, 20; theBoard of Trade, &amp;c, 50 ; the Dominions, 80 ; the Air Ministry, 10;with a precis-writing and legal section staff of 20. The above madea total of 237 persons, which made no provision for privatesecretaries. There was, in addition, a secretarial staff of about120 persons.After a brief discussion, in the course of which it was generally agreed that the numbers in many cases were unnecessarily large,the question of determining the number of persons from each government Department to be allotted to assist the british delegates at the Peace Conference was remitted by the War Cabinetto General Smuts, with full powers of decision.5. With reference to War Cabinet 505, Minute 6, the WarCabinet had before them a copy of a letter from General Smuts tothe Prime Minister, dated the 21st November, 1918 (Paper G.T.-6349), reporting progress in the preparation of the brief for theBritish delegates to the Peace Conference. The work was beingpushed on as fast as possible, but it would not be completed beforethe middle of December.
Occupation ofAustro-HungarianTerritory by american Troops.6. The War Cabinet took note of, and approved, Foreign office telegram No. 2523, to Paris, which instructed Lord Derby to informColonel House that, in the judgment of His Majesty&apos;s Government,it would be of the greatest possible value if an American force could accompany the Italian troops occupying, or intending to occupy, any part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.Proposed despatch 7. The War Cabinet had under consideration Lord Derby&apos;sof British Troops telegram No. 1357, reporting that the French Government hadto Austria. been asked by the Emperor of Austria, as well as by the Govern-ment of Austria-Hungary and Czecho-Slovakia, to send troops toVienna and Budapest to ensure order. The French Governmentwere determined to comply with this request, and were anxious thatBritish troops should participate equally. In any case, french troops, probably to the extent of some two or three divisions, wouldbe sent. In M. Clemenceau&apos;s opinion there was no question oftheir being engaged in military operations, and he thought thatthey would meet with a very friendly reception.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read a letter sup-supplementary to the above telegram, which he had received from lord Derby. The latter said that M. Clemenceau attached greatimportance to complying with this request, and had impressed upon Lord Derby that it was not a military operation, but merely amarch of honour, at the invitation of the authorities in Austria and hungary. Mr. Balfour said that he himself did not see how theFrench were going to find all the troops necessary for purposes ofoccupation. There had already been many desertions in the french army, especially among the older classes. There was no diplomaticor political reason for complying, except to please M. Clemenceau.He thought it was an intolerable position for British troops to becalled upon to act as police in the Austrian capitals. It was not ourbusiness to interfere in internal matters in the Central Empires.The French Governments present suggestion was a very different matter from the proposal to send British troops with the Italians toFiume and elsewhere in order to prevent disturbances between thelatter and the Yugo-Slavs. A dangerous feeling already existed,and he strongly favoured sending small bodies of British troops with whom he very much hoped that American troops would be associated to keep the peace. There was a further point: if therewas to be a march of honour in Vienna, why should there not alsobe one in Berlin ? Otherwise the Germans might say that their allies had been defeated, but that they themselves had not.The Secretary of State for War said that he would regard thefurther use of British troops as simply disastrous. Our militaryliabilities had already reached appalling dimensions, while everyday brought storms of applications for further releases. troops were required for Baku, Batum, Archangel, the Balkans, Fiume,Italy, Mesopotamia, and so on.   To meet the present demands wouldLord Curzon drew attention to the paragraph in the letter which stated that Sir Erie Richards, who was entrusted with thework of preparing the brief under General Smuts&apos; direction, was at present busy with the section on Turkey and the Middle East.Lord Curzon said that these particular questions were nowengaging the close attention of the Eastern Committee, and he hoped that Sir Erie Richards would not complete his brief, so faras these regions were concerned, without consulting the Committee.The War Cabinet requested General Smuts, as Minister in charge of the brief, and as amember of the Eastern Committee, to take the necessary action.
reduce our army in two months by one-half, and he stronglydeprecated any further commitments. He quite agreed -with Mr,Balfour that there was a distinct, reason for our associating ourselves with the Italians in order to prevent trouble arising between themand the Yugo-Slavs, but the present Austrian proposal was a very different matter, and we could have no idea what it might involve.We were already arranging to send food to Austria, and he thoughtthat that was a much better way of showing her kindness than by so-called &quot; marches of honour.&quot; If peace conditions obtained, andthe Austrians had really got a settled Government, it might be adifferent matter ; but Austria at present was in a state of ragingchaos, and it was the wrong moment for formal acts of display.The despatch of our troops might even lead to a great fiasco.Lord Curzon said he understood that the idea was that theFrench and ourselves should show troops in the two capitals inorder to give a feeling of security and to restore order. He himselfsaw no great objection to this, subject to three provisos : (a.) That the number of troops sent was limited.(b.) That the period for which they were to remain should be short.(c.) That the objects for which they were sent were clearly defined.It might possibly be desirable, if the French were going, thatwe should also show our flag.Mr. Barnes thought that it would be generally represented asan unwarrantable interference in the internal affairs of Austria. Thepolitical effect in this country of sending troops to Russia was bad.Lord Reading said that he was afraid that by sending troopswe might be led into complications, the result of which we couldnot foresee.General Smuts doubted whether this was very probable, if itwere true that the Austrians and Hungarians were now reallyfriendly to us.The War Cabinet decided that The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should inform theFrench Government in the sense that the British Govern-ment are unwilling to co-operate in the despatch of troops to Vienna and Budapest.American Thanks- ^&apos;        War Cabinet had under consideration a letter from the giving Day. United States Charge d&apos;Affaires, dated the 20th November, 1918,0 to Mr. Balfour, asking him to call the attention of the BritishGovernment to the fact that on the last Thursday in November theUnited States would celebrate a JSational Day of Thanksgiving andPrayer, and pointing out to him that the said Government might consider it appropriate to designate the 28th instant as a NationalDay of Thanksgiving.The Secretary said that the question had been discussed by theWar Cabinet at their Meeting on the 29th October (War Cabinet492, Minute 12), when it had been decided that Colonel Buchan, of- the Ministry of information, should ascertain the form of celebrationof Thanksgiving Day which would be most acceptable to the repre-sentatives of the American Government in England, and, after consulting the War Office, should submit his proposals to the WarCabinet for their consideration.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reminded the WarCabinet of the origin of Thanksgiving Day. Its history could betraced back to the time when the United States were a Britishcolony. There had been a total failure of the harvest in Massachu-setts, and at a critical moment British ships had appeared laden,with corn, and relieved the distress.
Merchant 9- The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by LordShipbuilding Pirrie (Paper G.T.-6210), in which he asked that arrangementsPosition. should be made for the immediate release, for merchant ship-building, of all shipyard workers at present with the Navy, Army,Royal Air Force, or other Government employment, and that these workers should be returned to the districts in which their homeswere situated, as far as possible.Lord Pirrie said that the matter was just as urgent now as itwas at the time when his memorandum was written, on the 4thNovember. Orders had lately been issued for proceeding with theconstruction of sixty-eight steamers for the various liner companies ships not of a luxurious type, but of the &quot;intermediate&quot; (cargoand passenger) class. These ships were required for the rebuilding of our export trade and revival of commerce, and unless the addi-tional men, for whom Lord Pirrie asked, were returned to the ship-yards, the tonnage in question could not be delivered. He addedthat he had given the War Office a list of the types of men required,and the numbers of the different types and trades.The Secretary of State for War said that it had been decided by the Cabinet that priority of demobilisation should be determinedby one Department, namely, the Ministry of Labour. Unless all thedemands for demobilised men, of which Lord Pirrie&apos;s demand wasbut one, came through one channel there was bound to be chaos.It was pointed out that large numbers of munition workers would shortly be disbanded in this country, and that it would be no good bringing men home from overseas while there were plenty of displaced men out of employment in England. It was mostimportant to avoid, if possible, the peril of unemployment in. the transition period.To  this  Lord Pirrie replied that the men disbanded frommunition works were not the men he wanted.   He required shipyardworkers, and he wanted them returned in a regular manner, e.g.,riveters before electricians.[1365-506] CLord Reading said that its original intention had evidently beenforgotten by the Americans, as in these days the celebrations took the form of thanksgiving for the fact that they were no longer aBritish dominion.Lord Curzon thought that we might assist in the celebrationswithout actually treating them- as a British Day of Thanksgiving.Colonel Buchan said that entertainments for the United states troops had been organised all over the country. Special services had also been arranged. He had seen the Dean of Westminster and suggested a service in the Abbey. The Dean had thought thisundesirable, as confusion might arise in the public mind if an american Thanksgiving Service were held as well as a British.The War Cabinet decided that There was not sufficient time to arrange a British National Thanks-giving Day to coincide with the American National Day ofThanksgiving and Prayer on the 28th November. they agreed, however, that everything possible should be done to assist the American representatives in their thanksgiving,by special services, which might be attended by british ministers, by decorating the streets with American flags,and in other appropriate fashion.They authorised Colonel Buchan to confer with the American Embassy in orderto ascertain their views, and, after consulting the Office ofWorks, to report the result of his conference to lord curzon, who undertook to deal with the question on behalfof the War Cabinet.
Sir Stephenson Kent asked whether the number of men requiredby Lord Pirrie was additional to the 150,000 pivotal men. If it werenot, he was afraid that he would be obliged to cause some disappoint-ment, because the 150,000 were already pledged.The Secretary of State for War said that he felt very anxious about this increase in the reduction of the numerical strength of thearmy. All the miners were to be returned, in addition to some30,000 demobilisers and 150,000 pivotal men. On top of this reduction came large demands like Lord Pirrie&apos;s, and the situation was becoming serious.The Adjutant-General said that volunteers were being called for to supply the Regular Army for the purpose of relieving the citizen soldiers now employed in garrisons, and this would make afurther drain on the. army of some 150,000 men. If the reductionof our Army continued, it would be very difficult to find even the30 British divisions required by Marshal Foch for the Army ofOccupation.The War Cabinet decided that The Department of the Controller-General of Merchant Ship-building should, in the first instance, confer with theMinistry of Labour on the subject, and that, if they werenot able to reach an agreement, the question should bebrought for decision before the Cabinet Committee on demobilisation.The Coal Situation: 10. With reference to War Cabinet 495, Minute 8, the WarEelease of Miners     Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministry of shipping from the Army.        (Paper G.T.-6187) and a memorandum by Sir Albert Stanley (paper g.T.-6299), covering a memorandum by the Coal Controller, inregard to the return of coal-miners from the forces.In his memorandum the Coal Controller said that to meet thecoal situation it was necessary that arrangements should at once bemade for an additional 100,000 miners to be returned from theforces.Sir Guy Calthrop said a good deal of progress had been madein getting men back to the coal-mines. Those miners who had joined the Army, but had not gone overseas, were,now all in processof returning to the mines. He wished to?j point out, however, thatthe coal situation was desperate, and he asked that there should bea speeding-up of the machinery of returning the men from overseas.The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained the great benefit tothe Exchange position that would result from increased output ofcoal..The Shipping Controller said that where there were no outwardcargoes from this country voyages of steamers were greatly affected.The Secretary of State for War said that he sympathised as muchas anyone with the desire for an increased output of coal, but thearrangements for the release of the men must be made in an orderly manner. Everything possible was being done. The Adjutant-General and the Coal Controller were in close touch. He did not seethat more could be done at present.The War Cabinet decided that The Coal controller and the Adjutant-General should continueto keep in constant communication on the subject of therelease of coal miners.Coal for Italy. n The War Gabinet tad before them Minutes of the 49thand 50th Meetings of the Military Representatives, Supreme WarCouncil (Papers G.T.-6152 and 6180 respectively), in regard to thesupply of coal to Italy.
93The Shipping Controller said that the matter appeared to be a simple one. There was not a doubt that Italy was in a sad positionas regards coal. She was only receiving from 500,000 to 600,000tons of coal a month. Of this amount, France supplied about150,000 tons, and she was now threatening to stop her shipments.Italy had made pathetic appeals to us, and we must make an effort and find the ships required for the conveyance of the coal. Hesuggested that the coal, or part of it, could be found by using a proportion of the coal that would from now on be economised bythe Navy.Sir Guy Calthrop said that the economy by the Navy onlyamounted to about 20,000 tons a week, and he had alreadydiverted this coal to the British railways, whose stocks were atdanger level. The Miners&apos; Federation were again threateningtrouble, and unless the railways maintained good stocks of coal thecountry would be at the mercy of the miners.The War Cabinet decided that The Coal Controller should do his best to supply the needs ofItaly as and when the output of coal increased.Transportation ofCoal and otherCommoditiesthroughSwitzerland.12. The War Cabinet had before them a letter from Sir SamFay to the Secretary of the War Cabinet (Paper G.T.-6207),dealing with the transportation of coal and other commoditiesthrough Switzerland.The War Cabinet decided To remit the matter to be dealt with by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs.Horse-Eacing, 13. With reference to War Cabinet 473, Minute 9, the WarCabinet had before them the following Papers : Memorandum by Sir Albert Stanlev (Paper G.T.-6263).Memorandum by Mr. Churchill (Paper G.T.-6326).The War Cabinet decided To approve the proposals recommended by the President of theBoard of Trade.Demobilisation of 14. The War Cabinet decided the Navy.To cancel their previous decision on the 11th November, 1918,that nothing should be done towards demobilising theNavy for the present, and that even pivotal men shouldnot be released until the German Fleet was either handedover or definitely under authoritative control. (WarCabinet 500 b, Minute 6).They gave full discretion to the Board of Admiralty to demo-bilise and redistribute their forces to the fullest extent that the naval situation permits.(Initialled) A. B. L.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,23rd November, 1918.
