The French had attacked north of the Aisne on a two-divisional front, and had captured about 800 prisoners. The Directorof Military Intelligence said that another Austrian division had been identified on the Italian front which was thought to be on theWestern front. This left three Austrian divisions in France, and possible two more.The Italian Front. 2. The Director of  Military Intelligence read to the WarCabinet the following wireless message which had been received that morning by the Supreme Command of the Italian Army : &quot; Tf the evacuation of Venetia is carried out under the pressure of the Italian Army, i.e., in the course of continuousfighting and battles, destruction and severe damage would be inevitable to the villages, bridges, and railways, &amp;c. If, on theother hand, hostilities were to be suspended, the evacuation ofthe well-cultivated plain, with its rich crops, would take place without any damage whatever to the country. For these reasons the Supreme Command desires to bring about an immediatesuspension of hostilities. (Signed) Carl, Imperator et Bex.&quot;[1365-493]
The Director of Military Intelligence said that the gaps, reportedin yesterda3r&apos;s minutes, between the Xth and Xllth Armies, had beenfilled up by the operations of the XVIIIth Corps. The battle nowextended to a front of 30 miles, and the Allies had penetrated to ad^pth of 8 miles. Heavy fighting was taking place in the Grappadistrict, where the best Austrian troops were opposing the advance.On the remainder of the front the Austrians were retiring withoutfighting. The total captures to date were 17,000 prisoners and 150 .guns. The Director of Military Intelligence said thatGeneral Diaz had expressed great confidence in the Xth Army,under the command of Lord Cavan. The British XlVth Corpshad done splendidly.3. The Director of Military Intelligence reported that the22nd Division had landed at Dedeagatch on Monday last. in answer to a question, the Director of Military Intelligence said thatthis division was the right of three columns advancing on Constanti-nople. He was of opinion that the first engagement with the Turksmight take place on the Maritza River, on the left bank of whichthe Turkish advanced troops had arrived.Attention was drawn to War Office telegram No. 69689, datedthe 29th October, 1918, in which instructions were given to general milne to send a British battalion to Scutari.The Director of Military Intelligence said he thought that sometroops were being despatched. General Franchet d&apos;Esperey wasdisinclined to allow Italian troops to go north of the Drin River, but had invited their co-operation at Scutari.The Deputy First Sea Lord said that the Admiralty hadconsented to two officers and forty Royal Marines proceeding toScutari until the British battalion arrived.The Director of Military Intelligence said that between Nishand Belgrade there were about three German and two and a halfAustrian divisions, the latter probably fighting under Germansupervision. The Serbians were about 50 miles from Belgrade atthe moment.4. The Director of Military Intelligence said that informa-tion had been received with regard to General Kress, the com-mander of the German forces in the Caucasus. General Kresshad instructions that, in the event of the probable evacuation oftfie Caucasus, lie was to retain at Tiffis a bodyguard of 500 men.The Director of Military Intelligence said that at the presentmoment there were four Turkish divisions in the Caucasus, andelements of other divisions. The Turkish divisions in that regionwere about 3,000 rifles strong.5. Lord Curzou asked the Director of Military Intelligencewhether he could give the Cabinet any information with regard tothe position of the various Allied forces in Russia.The Director of Military Intelligence said that, as regardsArchangel, General Poole would have to remain inactive during thewinter, owing to weather conditions. There was no communication between the forces at Archangel and the Czechs on the Volga. Asregards the Czecho-Slovaks, they had had to give ground on theVolga, and were considering a retirement on the Urals, where theywould endeavour to hold the passes. This force was in a precariousposition as regards food, arms, and equipment, owing to the factthat the Allies were not helping them. As the Cabinet were aware, the United States had not allowed any of their troops toleave the neighbourhood of Vladivostock, and the Japanese weredisinclined to move their forces west of Lake Baikal.   There was
training of thesethatSubmarines.6. The Deputy&quot; First Sea Lord reported that an enemy sub-marine had attempted to enter Scapa on the night of the 28thinstant, and was blown up on the detector minefield. Divers hadlocated the wreck. This was the first attempt of an enemy submarine to enter Scapa.Smyrna.)7. The Deputy First Sea Lord stated that a report had beenreceived from the commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, on 22ndOctober, that British invalid prisoners, women and children, to atotal number of 1,000, were in or near Smyrna; that deaths wereoccurring daily among the invalid prisoners ; and that the turkish authorities were willing for a British vessel to remove them at once,without waiting for the arrival of the Turkish prisoners to be repatriated under the agreement, who were not due until the15th November. The Admiralty had therefore arranged for thehospital ship &quot; Kanowna&quot; to proceed to Smyrna at once to embarkthem. The Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, had been instructedto endeavour to arrange for the balance (apparently about 200) ofthe 1,000 British combatant invalids to be transferred under theagreement to be embarked in the steam-ship &quot; Empire,&quot; whichwould take the Turkish prisoners to be repatriated.a composite French, British, and Italian force, about 2,000 to 3,000strong, which was not far east of Omsk. This latter force was theonly one that appeared to be trying to render any assistance to the czecho-Slovaks.Lord Robert Cecil then raised the question of the training ofthe Russian forces in Siberia and the position of General Knox he recalled the fact that General Knox had been given permission to train 3,000 Russians, on the understanding that when the Frencharrived at VJadivostock he might have to hand over to them theforces. The French had now issued instructionsno one was to train the Russians but themselves. This leftGeneral Knox with little to do in Siberia, and a suggestion hadbeen made that we should withdraw General Knox and all thesupplies which we had proposed to send for the use of the Russians.Lord Robert Cecil hesitated to agree with this suggestion. TheFrench might raise no objection to our withdrawal. This wouldresult in a complete breakdown, and the whole movement of re-organising the Russian forces would be compromised. He suggestedthat the War Office should send an officer with complete infor-mation to Lord Milner, in Paris, with a view of the latter taking up the question with the French, so as to arrive at a workingarrangement.This proposal met with the approval of the War Cabinet, butat a later stage in the meeting a message was received from theWar Office that,the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, before he had proceeded to France, had made himself acquainted with the whole position in Siberia, and he was going to raise the question with theFrench while he was in Paris.In these circumstances the War Cabinet decided that A reminder should be sent by the Director of Military Intelli-gence to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, informing him that the War Cabinet had discussed the situation that morning, and requesting him not to fad to come to some arrangement with the French Government on the subject.
8. Reference was made to the large number of problems arisingout of this important subject, and to the possibility of dealing withsome of them by meetings of representatives of the Ministries con-cerned, without the necessity of bringing them before the WarCabinet. It was pointed out that the War Office Scheme of Demo-demobilisation was well advanced, but that&apos;the Labour scheme had not reached the same level.With reference to War Cabinet 492, Minute 16, it was proposedthat three members of the War Cabinet should meet, with theauthority and powers of the War Cabinet, to dispose of demobilisa-tion questions, and it was decided that General Smuts, Mr. Chamberlain, and Mr. Barnes shoidd meetfor this purpose.9. Mr. Barnes reported to the War Cabinet the result of aConference held that morning on the position amongst the aircraftwoodworkers at Aintree and other places. The Conference had decided that, if the men failed to return to work within three days,their protection from recruitment should automatically lapse, andthat an injunction should be sought from the High Court to restrain the Trade Union from threatening to expel members who have con-tinued to work on the system of payment by results.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,October 30, 1918.
