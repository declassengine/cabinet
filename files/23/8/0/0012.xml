Cabinet had before them the following documents :-Memoranda by the Minister of Munitions (Papers G.T.-5863,6041)Memoranda by the Minister of Labour  (Papers G.T.-5947,6001).Memoranda by the Minister of Reconstruction (Papers G.T.-5351,6047).Minute 1 of the Ninth Meeting of the Economic Defence andDevelopment Committee, dated 24th September, 1918.Mr. Churchill said that it was not desired to settle the largeproblems of reconstruction now, but to obtain, without prejudice tosuch settlement, the decisions which were immediately required inview of the possible near approach of demobilisation. The powersrequired had been classified in his memorandum (Paper G.T.-6041)under the following seven heads : (1.) The termination of contracts for the supply of munitions.(2.) The disposal of stores, stocks of materials, machinery, &amp;c,in the possession of the Ministry of Munitions.(3.) The arrangements for the disposal, or post-war use, ofnational factories, with their plant and equipment.(4.) The control of materials during the transitional period.
2(5.) The special arrangements with the iron and steel traderequired in order to secure continuity of output from theblast furnaces and rolling mills.(6.) The reinstatement of peace industry, particularly in the-engineering and chemical trades.(7.) The demobilisation of civilian munitions labour.The Prime Minister said that it was impossible, at this stage,to foretell how the armistice and peace negotiations would proceedThe conditions of the armistice would not be final, and the germans might ask for terms which would not be acceptable. While, on theone hand, if the probabilities of peace were very high, it would bea mistake to continue piling up mimitions of war; on the otherhand, so long as there was any possibility of hostilities beingresumed, it would not do to dismantle factories or turn thementirely on to peace products. Assuming that the Government hadto be ready for either contingency, it was important to provide for thethousands who might conceivably be thrown out of work in the transitional period, and especially for the discharged women.Mr. Chamberlain said that much would depend on the terms ofthe armistice. The Minister of Munitions should not cease orslacken his production until he received instructions from the WarCabinet, but he should be prepared with a policy which could be putinto operation in harmony with these instructions. He should be free to complete the manufacture of products which were nearer awar stage than a peace stage. In the case of commodities like ironand steel, he could carry the preliminary processes of production upto the point where civilian and war production began to diverge, and keep it at that neutral point as long as possible. On the signing ofan armistice he should not interrupt the manufacture of goods likeguns, aeroplanes, and tanks, which covered many months from startto finish ; but in these cases the earliest processes might be arrested.Generally, the principle to be borne in mind was that every legiti-mate effort should be made to prevent unemployment and itsaccompanying demoralisation. It was far better to run the risk of manufacturing commodities which would not be required, and to resolve them into their elements later, than to have multitudes inreceipt of unemployment benefit. With regard to the terminationof contracts for the supply of munitions, the Minister of Munitionsshould be given a general sanction from the Treasury to make thebest bargain possible. No one outside the Ministry was competent to say in a specific case whether it was preferable to proceed with themanufacture. It was a matter of degree. Full authority should begiven to the Minister to use his discretion as to when any factoryshould be turned from war work to peace w^ork, subject to thegeneral instructions of the War Cabinet as to the military position.Mr. Churchill said that commodities varied very largely, not onlyin the time required for their manufacture from the first stage to thelast, but also in the amount of reserves in the country. In some casesthe reserves were equal to a few weeks&apos; supply; in others there wereample supplies for many months, and during the uncertain conditionsof an armistice it would be possible for him to slow down in the casesof ample supply, and to continue normal production in the other cases.The period between the armistice and the peace ought to be utilised,as far as possible, in preparing for peace conditions. Fortunately therew-ere certain products, like rails, which had an ambiguous value and could be used in either peace or war; and there were other devices,like working short time, which could be resorted to in order to lessen the amount of unemployment. Processes of manufacture coveringeight or nine months could be stopped at the initial stages.Dr. Addison said that the more material the Ministry ofMunitions could release for peace products, the greater the start weshould have over the Germans in recovering the commercial markets of the world.   The same would apply in the case of the textile trades,
under the direction of the War Office. The percentage of their war production could be reduced by many units during the armisticeperiod. In places where girls were engaged on repetition work in munition factories, unemployment benefit would, sooner or later, berequired, except in case of those whom it might be possible to absorbin the textile and similar trades.Sir J. Stevenson said that a Committee had been considering what could be done to provide work for the shell-girls, and it was thought that they could be employed in manufacturing things whichwere formerly imported, or at least they could be preparing for suchmanufacture.Sir Robert Home said that the problem of the Admiralty wasa smaller one, as the labour with which they were most concernedwas engaged on merchant ships and naval craft. Any labourdiverted from the latter could all be absorbed on merchant ship-building. Of ordinary shells there was a considerable supply. Inthe case of a certain new shell, the production would be continued until there was a; complete outfit for the navy. * He presumed thatthe armistice would provide conditions that would involve a complete stoppage of submarine warfare, and this would relieve some elements of production.Mr. Roberts said that, from the standpoint of unemployment,a very great deal would depend on the amount of material which theMinistry of Munitions could release for the manufacture of peaceproducts.The Prime Minister asked wdiether anyone had worked out what the depletion of the labour reservoir, due to the war, wouldbe in reference to peace demands. There would, perhaps, be1,500,000 who had been killed or disabled, who would otherwise have been in the labour market but for the war, and there were those who would have emigrated. On the other side, we had toconsider the probable demands for labour the arrears in every direction, iu the manufacture of ships, locomotives, machinery,textiles, supplies for the Colonies, houses, and improved roadsat home.Dr. Addison said that a calculation had been made that duringthe transitional period there might be 500,000 persons for whom theGovernment would have to make special provision for some six ornine months. The rapidity with which these could be absorbedwould mainly depend on the supply of raw materials and on thelength of the notice which the Government would be able to give,during the armistice period, of the time when the war would end.The Prime Minister said that, in his view, the work of demobili-sation was so important that it should be put in the charge of someone officer who should be responsible to the Minister of Labour forthe movement of men over the country. A huge machine would berequired to absorb the men as they came from the Army, and to distribute them through the country where work was available forthem. Unless this were done swiftly and efficiently there might be serious disturbances. A promise had been given that work shouldbe found for the demobilised men, and this, of course, might involveturning out large numbers of women.Dr. Addison and Mr. Churchill concurred in the desirability of appointing such a Director-General of Civil Demobilisation, althoughit might not be wise at this stage to adopt such a name for the post.Mr. Churchill added that he proposed to hand over his LabourDepartment to be placed under this officer.Mr. Chamberlain stated that there were really three maindivisions of duties to be arranged. The work of demobilisation andre-settlement, on its civilian side, should be done by the Ministry ofLabour; the demobilisation of the controlled factories should becarried out by the Minister of Munitions, in consultation with theWar Office, the Admiralty, and the Air Ministry ; the provision of programmes of reconstruction work, and the order of their priority,[1365-491] B 2
would fall to the Ministry of Reconstruction. He would like theMinister of Labour and the Minister of Reconstruction, in the lightof this discussion, to put forward the specific powers they required from the War Cabinet in order to carry out these duties.Sir Auckland geddes stated that what was now proposedinvolved the transference to the Ministry of Labour of the LabourDepartment of the Ministry of Munitions and the Admiralty, andcertain adjustments would be required also with the War Office andthe Ministry of National Service. It would be absolutely necessary,therefore, that the Ministry of Labour should be greatly reinforcedin personnel, and a new Joint Secretary, rather than a Director-General, appointed to be responsible for the work of demobilisation.In his opinion, a registration system would be needed, and itcould be built out of the military register of the NationalService Ministry, which might, in whole or in part, be handedover to the Ministry of Labour. Further, there would haveto be developed the machinery for out-of-work benefit whichwas proposed. The key to success in demobilisation was theEmployment Exchange Service. If there were any breakdownat all, it would be at the Exchanges, and the first thing todo was to overhaul and strengthen the staffs, now depleted byrecruiting, and for other reasons not very efficient. In many centresthe Exchanges did not enjoy the confidence of the larger employersand some of the Local Advisory Committees were indifferent. Thequestion of the demobilisation and absorption of officers into civiloccupation was scarcely a less anxious one than that of the rank and file. In his opinion, the machinery, both at the War Office andunder the Ministry of Labour, required considerable development.In this connection the experience of Canada would repay study.Mr. Roberts said that there had been a marked improvementduring the war in the quality of the work done by the Exchanges.The framework was there, and what was now required was a con-siderable expansion. The immediate release of men from the army was absolutely essential in order to strengthen the staff, and moreaccommodation was urgently needed.Sir Robert Home said that he had not had an opportunity of discussing with the Board of Admiralty the question now underconsideration, but, speaking for himself alone, he thought the generalscheme as to demobilisation which had been put forward by theMinister of Munitions in his memorandum was a sound one.The War Cabinet decided (a.) To approve the recommendations made in the memorandumby the Minister of Munitions (Paper G.T.-6041), and gave the necessary sanction for the powers thereinasked for;(b.) To approve the appointment of an additional Secretary to&apos; &apos; &apos; the Ministry of Labour, who should be specially chargedwith the work of civil mobilisation ;(c.) To approve the proposal to transfer to the Ministry ofLabour from the labour machinery of the various Govern-ment Departments, including the Labour Department ofthe Ministry of Munitions and the Labour Departmentof the Admiralty, such staff as may be necessary for thework of demobilisation ;(d.) To authorise the Minister of Reconstruction in conjunctionwith the Minister of Munitions to prepare schemes forthe utilisation of national factories in connection with public peace requirements;(e.) To request the Minister of Reconstruction and the Minister&apos; of Labour to submit, at an early date, a summary of thepowers which they would require in order to carry outthe work of demobilisation, for which they requiredCabinet sanction.
Restoration of 2. In connection with the previous minute, and with referencePre-War Practices   to &quot;War Cabinet 487, Minute 17, the War Cabinet briefly con-Bill, sidered the question of the undertaking which had been given tothe Trade Unions to restore their pre-war practices.Mr. Churchill reminded the War&apos; Cabinet that serious conflictwould arise with the Trade Unions the moment demobilisation began,unless some satisfactory agreement with them had been come to inadvance on the question of the pledges. If the pledges were to bekept, not a single dilutee could be employed on work done before thewar by skilled men. For the Government to pass the Bill which hadbeen, prepared would be to give powers which might be used to clear out tens of thousands of women from the factories. In hisopinion, it would be infinitely better for the Government to bring forward an advanced programme of industrial betterment instead of proceeding with the Bill.The Prime Minister asked whether the Trade Unionists were entitled to more than that they should not be deprived of employ-ment because an unskilled man was in their place. Would they have any grievance if there were work for the skilled -men and for the unskilled ? It should suffice to guarantee that the skilled man hadhis job.Mr. Roberts said that, however irrational it might appear,nothing short of the statutory fulfilment of the pledges would satisfy the men. By this means they meant to increase their bargaining power.Dr. Addison said that, if the men obtained the Bill, he feltconfident they would be willing to enter into bargains with theemployers for the continuance of the dilutees. Definite promises hadbeen given, and, unless they were honoured, the Government wouldlay up for itself a mass of trouble.Sir David Shackleton said it was most desirable that the periodof the armistice and the peace should start with good feeling between the Government, the masters, and the men. failure to fulfil the pledges would be tantamount to throwing over theaccredited leaders of the Unions, who would be charged withhaving betrayed the men. The upshot would be the destructionof organised Trade Unionism, and a great stimulus to the extremists.Mr. Barnes thought it would be worth while making- a seriousconciliatory effort by calling a Conference of masters and men,putting before them frankly the difficulties which confronted theGovernment, and appealing to them to support the larger policyindicated by Mr. Churchill.Mr. Chamberlain supported the suggestion of a Conference.He thought there would be great difficulty in passing the proposed bill through the House of Commons, because the Bill in effect wasone to legalise what everyone knew to be intolerable industrialpractices.No decision was reached.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,October 25, 1918.o
