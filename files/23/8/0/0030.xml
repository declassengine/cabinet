Marwood made a brief statement in regard to the situation.   Hesaid that Sir Albert Stanley, who was in Manchester, had sent for sir Herbert Walker, and it might therefore be presumed that sir Albert intended to see Mr. J. H. Thomas and Mr. Bromley witha view to getting them to agree to postpone the question underdispute until after the General Election.The War Cabinet agreed that No action was required for the present, pending receipt offurther information from the President of the Board ofTrade.
Bonus on Pensions. 2. Mr. Barnes asked for Cabinet sanction to a proposal thatthere should be a 20 per cent, bonus on war disablement pensions for non-commissioned officers and men and their widows and dependants as from the 1st November, .1918, to the 30th June, 1919.Under this scheme the question of the alternative pension was not affected, save that if any widow entitled to it should profit by receiving -the pension described above, she should be entitled to receive thegreater.Dr. Macnamara, who arrived at a later stage in the meeting,said that he concurred in the proposal submitted by Mr. Barnes.The War Cabinet decided That Mr. Barnes&apos;s proposal in regard to the 20 per cent, bonuson war disablement pensions should be approved, subjectto the agreement of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.President Wilson&apos;sAddress to congress:Transport ofUnited states troops, j3. Mr. Chamberlain drew the attention of the War Cabinet tothe report of President Wilsons message to Congress, dated the2nd December, wdiich had appeared in the English newspapers that morning.In the part of his address which referred to the movement ofUnited States troops, President Wilson is reported to have said : &quot;Ayear ago we had 145,918 men overseas. Since then we have sent1,950,513, an average of 162,542 each month. No such movementof troops ever took place before over 3,000 miles of sea, followed byadequate equipment and supplies, and carried safely through extra-ordinary dangers which were alike strange and infinitely difficult toguard against. In all this movement only 758 men were lost by enemy attack, 630 of whom were on a single English transportwhich was sunk near the Orkney Islands.&quot; Mr. Chamberlainsuggested that Lord Reading shoidd write a private letter to colonel house, expressing regret that there was no mention in the Presi-dent&apos;s message, as reported in the press, of the great assistancerendered by the British, as regards both conveyance and escort, inthe transport of the American troops to France. The sole referenceto Great Britain&apos;s effort was contained in the sentence about the sinking of the English transport. Such a statement of the casecould only be regarded as extremely ungenerous, and would tend toincrease the difficulties of Lord Reading&apos;s task.The War Cabinet requested Lord Reading to send a letter in the above sense to colonel house.They also requested Sir Joseph Maclay to arrange for a newspaper interview on thesubject, in which he would say that while no doubt thePresident meant to imply that assistance had been rendered by Great Britain, at the same time it was desirable thatthe amount of such assistance in respect of conveyanceand escort should be made known.Sir Joseph Maclay undertook to compile a statement in this sense, and to submit it to the Prime Minister before issuing it tothe press.Bepatriation of 4. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChinese Coolies.        Ministry of Shipping (G.T.-6399) in regard to the repatriation of chinese coolies.Sir Joseph Maclay said that there were at the present time twopassenger vessels, belonging to the Canadian Pacific Railway, which
Requisitioning of premises.were going to be put back in the Pacific for military and tradepurposes. If coolies were not skipped the space would be wasted,as for the present a sufficient amount of export cargo was notavailable. If advantage were not taken of the space for coolies now,these would have to be repatriated later on, when the export trade had been reconstituted, and they would then be carried at theexpense of cargo.The Adjutant-General said that he had taken this matter up with G.H.Q. in France, who were averse from the idea of repa-triating Chinese coolies at the present time. There was a great dealof work to be done, e.g., handling cargo at the ports, upkeep of roads, filling up the shell-holes, and rolling up the barbed wire, forwhich civilian labour would have to be engaged if the Chinese were withdrawn.Colonel Wetherall said that the Chinese suffered very little fromill-health ; out of a total strength of some 93,000 Chinese in France,there were only about 1,500 in hospital.The Prime Minister pointed out that while it would be a seriousdecision to repatriate all the Chinese, having regard to the shortageof labour in France, at the same time it was obvious that theamount of work requiring this class of labour must have greatlydiminished since the cessation of hostilities. For instance, theroads were no longer torn up by shells, and there was no new con-struction of railways. It therefore seemed reasonable that a startshould be made in repatriating the Chinese.The War Cabinet decided That the Shipping Controller, in conjunction with the WarOffice, should make, arrangements for the immediaterepatriation of 5,000 Chinese coolies, and that a further5,000 should be got ready to follow.5. The War Cabinet had before them the following papers inregard to the requisition of premises for the use of GovernmentDepartments : Memorandum by Sir A. Mond (G.T.-6305).Recommendations to the War CabinetCommittee (H.A.C.-17, Minute 7).Memorandum by Sir E. Geddes (G.T.-6418)the Home  AffairsThe War Cabinet approved the recommendations of the Coni-mittee of Home Affairs (H.A.C., 17th Minutes), and directed thatin the event of there being any appeals against this decision theyshould be addressed to the Home Affairs Committee in the firstinstance, and not brought before the War Cabinet except by theChairman of the Home Affairs Committee.Imperial WarMemoriai andMuseum.6. The War Cabinet had before them the following papers inregard to the Imperial War Memorial and Museum :  Report of Lord Crawford&apos;s Committee, G.-202.Letter from Sir A. Mond to the Prime Minister, G.T.-6343.The War Cabinet decided That this question should he postponed until after the GeneralElection.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,December 4, 1918.o
