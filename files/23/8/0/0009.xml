Preparation ofBrief for PeaceConference.1. THE War Cabinet gave some preliminary consideration tothe preparations required for an eventual Peace Conference. It waspointed ont that an International Peace Conference would probablybe preceded by a Conference between the Allied Governments.&apos; this might be even more important than the Peace Conference itself,since the Allies would jDrobabiy be in a position to impose the termyupon which they themselves had agreed.It was agreed that a brief should be drawnup for those who might have to attend such an Allied Conference.The Prime Minister stated that he was enquiring for the servicesof a suitable man, preferably a lawyer, who could consolidate thematerial prepared by various Government Departments whose dutyit was to prepare our case in detail.After some discussion the War Cabinet invited Lord Readingto suggest for their consideration the name of a suitable man, inorder to bring together the material available in a concentratedform.In connection with the preparation of this brief, the War cabinet agreed (a.) That the Secretary of State for War should have amemorandum prepared setting forth the total contributionmade and casualties incurred by the British Empire andits Allies respectively, giving the figures for each theatre of war seperately;(6.) That the Admiralty should prepare a statement of thenaval effort made by the British Empire and its Alliesduring the war, and the casualties incurred, differentiatingin the same manner as the War Office memorandum ;(c.) That similar memoranda, should be submitted by The Air Ministry, in regard to aerial effort;The Treasury, in regard to financial effort ;The Ministry of Shipping, in regard to shipping-effort ;(d.) That the Board of Trade, in consultation with otherDepartments concerned, should prepare a memorandumon the economic considerations involved.The War Cabinet also agreed that it was very desirable thatthey should be in a position to have clearly in their minds a com-plete statement of our desiderata in regard to the disposal of territory taken from the enemy.It was decided that The Foreign Office anstatement of otuthe Colonial Office should prepare , acase in regard to the   territories inregardquestion for early consideration by the War CabinetThe Western 2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the WarFront.      . Cabinet that Belgian forces had reached the milestone 12 kilometresfrom Ostend, and were advancing on that place with little opposi-tion.    It was probable that the enemy on this portion of the frontwould have to retire to the Dutch frontier.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that the BritishIVth Army and the French 1st Army attacked at 9&apos;30 that morningon a front of 30 kilometres between Le Cateau and Mont d&apos;d&apos;origny.According to information received at 11 o&apos;clock, we had progressedabout 2 or 3 kilometres, and the French had taken 1,000 prisonersat Mont d&apos;d&apos;origny.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that general plumer&apos;s army had now turned south, had crossed the Lys, and was-moving towards Lille.
Ostend. 3. The First Sea Lord stated that a force had been organised by the Admiralty for the reconstruction of the Port of Ostend, andwould commence work as soon as the town fell into our hands.Armistice with turkey.4. With reference to War Cabinet 486, Minute 2, the question was raised as to whether President Wilson contemplated replying tothe note addressed to him by the Turks on the question of peace.It was suggested that a telegram might be sent to thePresident, saying that we believed the Turks to be on the point ofcollapse, and the situation would be greatly improved as soon as an armistice was concluded, and that we should suggest to the president that, in his reply to the Turkish note, he might inform the lurksthat General alien by was in a position to negotiate an armistice.It was pointed out, however, that, if we asked the President to-instruct the Turks to approach General Allenby, it might be thoughtthat we were endeavouring to steal a march on the French, especially as the French did not know that we ha,d sent the terms of a Turkisharmistice to General Allenlry.The War Cabinet decided that The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should send atelegram to Washington in the sense that PresidentWilson, in reply to the Turkish request for his interven-tion, should advise the Turks to make an application foran armistice to the commander of one of the naval or military forces operating against the Turks, and that the telegram should draw attention to the advantages of concluding an armistice with the Turks as soon as possible,amongst which would be the moral effect on Germany andthe opening of the Black Sea.The Shipping 5. With reference to War Cabinet 487, Minute 15, the CabinetProblem. further considered the question of issuing to the public a statementof the shipping position, as recommended by the Allied maritime transport Council (Paper G.T.-5988).Lord Robert Cecil stated that, although there was animjDrovement in the general war situation, there was no improve-ment in the shipping situation. He was informed that therehad been a considerable increase in the consumption of food in last few weeks, and, in order to prevent subsequent hardship, should thewar continue, it was desirable, to warn the public against waste.Sir Joseph Maclay thought that perhaps, in view of the uncertainty of the international situation at the moment, it might be wise to delay the publication of the statement for a short time.The War Cabinet decided  To postpone the issue of the statement for the present,and requested Lord Robert Cecil to raise the matter again, should he deem it-necessary.Offences againstthe Law by EnemyIndividuals.6. The War Cabinet had before them a letter from the LawOfficers of the Crown to the Prime Minister, dealing with offences against the law by enemy individuals (Paper G.T.-5956).The Attorney-General said that the matter had been raisedbecause not only in this country, but also in France and the UnitedStates it had been explicitly announced that, in cases where graveoffences against the law could be proved against enemy individuals,punishment should be demanded. He understood that certainrecords had been kept at the Foreign Office and at the War Office,and it was desirable that such records and all relevant materials should be collected and examined for the purpose of showing who
are the individuals charged, what are the offences charged against them, and what is, in each case, the available evidence in support pfthe charge. In consultation with the Solicitor-General, he had drawn up a list of persons versed in International Law and theLaw of Evidence, who might form a suitable Committee to collatethe material.It was suggested that the Government also needed advice as tothe nature and composition of any tribunal that it might bethought desirable to set up for the trial of s\ich offences, and theCommittee might also consider that point.The War Cabinet decided (a.) To approve the appointment of the Committee proposed bythe Law Officers, who should draft its terms of reference,and take the necessary action to set up the Committee ;(b.) The Committee should consider the nature and composition of any tribunal that it might be necessary-y to set up todeal with the offences under consideration;(c.) The appointment of the Committee should not be made public.Post-Wax Disposalof SurplusGovernmentProperty.7. With reference to War Cabinet 298, Minute 3, the WarCabinet had before them a copy of a resolution passed by the SurplusGovernment Property Advisory Council on the 10th October, 1918(Paper G.T.-5949, amended), together with a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (Paper G.T.-G002), and a memorandumby the Minister of Reconstruction (Paper G.T.-6003), dealing withcertain administrative difficulties which had arisen in connection withthe composition and powers of the body, or bodies, which shouldbe charged with the clisuosa! of Government stores at the end of thewar.The War Cabinet decided that Mr. Chamberlain should settle the question in consultation witha Committee composed as follows : Mr. Chamberlain (Chairman),Lord Salisbury,Sir Eric Geddes, 1Lord Milner,Lord Weir,Sir A. Stanley.Mr. Churchill,Dr. Addison,Sir A. Mond,A Representative of the Treasury,Mr. Pembroke Wicks (Secretary),to decide upon the best method of obtaining a proper disposal of surplus Government property.Release beforeGeneralDemobilisationof &quot; Pivotal&quot; men.8.
