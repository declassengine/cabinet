I. THE War Cabinet had under consideration a telegramNo. 1177, from Lord Derby dealing with the surrender of bulgaria and the conditions of the armistice granted.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said, that there was really honews about Bulgaria, except what was contained in this telegram.At the meeting which he addressed yesterday, he had endeavoured to show that the terms of the armistice had been arranged by theAllies in consultation; but events had moved so quickly that, as amatter of fact, it appeared that the conditions had been laid downfbythe French Commander-in-Chief in Salonica, General franchet d&apos;Esperey. It would seem also from the last paragraph of the telegram even as if General d&apos;Esperey had arranged the conditionsof the armistice before communicating even with M. Clemenceau.In reply to a question as to whether M. Clemenceau had authority from Great Britain and the other Allies to act in thismatter, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs expressed theopinion that the conditions of the armistice were practically amilitary convention, and carried with them no powers of peace. on questions of peace terms all the Allies were on an equality, but inregard to a military convention the General Officer Commanding inthe Field must necessarily be in a position to act promptly. Theline which could be drawn between a military and a politicalsituation could be defined as that which laid down the conditions for an armistice and that which defined the terms of peace, andin this instance nothing had been decided about the future of bulgaria. It was certainly true that peace terms might be affectedby the terms of an armistice, and Mr. Balfour pointed out that thePrime Minister and he had despatched a telegram to Paris on saturday last dealing with the Bulgarian request for an armistice,the terms of which were in fact almost identical with those actuallyadopted.The attention of the War Cabinet was particularly drawn tothat part of the telegram dealing with the note sent by the UnitedStates Minister at Sophia to General d&apos;Esperey demandingthe mediation of President Wilson and the reply ofM. Clemenceau telling General d&apos;Esperey to have no relations withthe Minister, and informing him - that he had telegraphed to washington protesting against such intervention.The Secretary said that he had spoken on the telephone to thePrime Minister, who was in general agreement with M. Clemenceau&apos;telegram, but was sending up that morning, by Lord Milner, atelegram to be sent in reply.Lord Reading urged that it would be most undesirable for theGovernment to associate themselves with what might be consideredby President Wilson to be a rebuff. Whatever our right might be,such a proceeding must inevitably create a most deplorableposition.It was pointed out that the War Cabinet had no evidence before them either that President Wilson would adopt the attitude taken up by the United States Minister at Sofia, or that theMinister was acting on instructions from Washington, and it wassuggested that a telegram should be sent to Lord Derby statingthat the War Cabinet were apprehensive as to the terms of the telegram sent to Washington by M. Clemenceau, and requestinghim to forward a copy of the telegram in full.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that the militarysituation which was now being created in Bulgaria was one which *demanded most careful consideration. When General Guillaumatadvocated the present campaign in Macedonia, the main reasons putforward were that, if it were successful, the French and British troops could then be withdrawn. Now M. Clemenceau, in instructingGeneral d&apos;Esperey to go to the Danube as quickly as possible inorder to cut off supplies, and also to the Black Sea at Opnstanza,was preparing a campaign without any consultation with the Allies.
M. Clemenceau also proposed to occupy strategic positions, whichpresumably meant Sofia, but there was to be no interference withBulgarian affairs. It was difficult to understand how there could beno interference with the civil authorities in Bulgaria if the Bulgarianarmy were demobilised and disarmed, and local disturbances, even ifthere were no attack by the enemy, took place. M. Clemenceau had apparently taken charge of the situation from a military point ofview, and he could not possibly know what railways, transports, orreinforcements were available. As far as could be ascertained,General Milne was pushing up troops in lorries to Sofia so as to take part in a parade there, if one took place. Moreover, M. Clemenceauwas confining the Serbians to berbia and the Greeks to Greece, sothat consequently the only troops who entered Bulgaria would be-French, British, and Italians. There was one further point of greatimportance, namely, that at the meeting of the Supreme WarCouncil at Versailles, M. Clemenceau had agreed that no general should be appointed to command in Salonica without theapproval of the Allies, if any alteration in the present command wasmade. General Guill*aumat had apparently. been sent out byM. Clemenceau with instructions to General d&apos;Esperey, and GeneralGuillaumat appeared to act now in the capacity of Commissioner.It was generally agreed that the Allied Governments must be consulted before any further military operations took place, andthat this consultation could only take place at a meeting of theSupreme War Council.The War Cabinet decided that In the opinion of the War Cabinet, it was essential that ameeting of the Supreme War Council should be held assoon as possible in Paris, in order to discuss the politicaland military situations which had now arisen.2. Arising out of the previous Minute, the War Cabinet had under consideration the situation which would arise if the TurkishCommander-in-Chief forwarded to General Allenby proposals foran armistice similar to those which had been proposed by Bulgaria,and it was pointed out that it was most important that the Govern-ment should be ready at any moment to meet this situation. Theopinion was expressed that if Turkey asked for an armistice,instructions should be at once sent for the British fleet to go to the black Sea, and that as it might be only a question of hours, it wouldbe most advisable for the Admiralty to have all the plans prepared.The First Sea Lord explained the difficulty of the situation asregards the naval affairs in the Mediterranean, and pointed out thatthe British Admiral, although he commanded the iEgean zone andall the small craft, was under the command of the French Admiral.The British Admiralty would certainly not like to see a squadrongoing up the Dardanelles except under British command. If Turkeywent out of the war it was possible that the &quot; Goeben &quot; might come out of the Straits, but it was more likely that she would go back toOdessa. With regard to the Russian ships, Admiral Wemyss said it was not thought that they could not be ready until November,and the Allied naval force would be able to account for them in the black Sea. The Admiralty were sending out two Dreadnoughts to relieve the &quot; Lord Nelson&quot; and the &quot; Agamemnon.&quot; The first ofthese was due to leave England on the 9th of this month, but arrangements could be made by which she could leave at an earlier date. The other Dreadnought was doing a long refit, and wouldnot be ready until the end of next month. It was impossible tosend anymore Dreadnoughts from the Grand Fleet. A force wasbeing prepared to send out to Serbia to act on the Danube if it was required.In reply to the opinion expressed that the &quot;Goeben&quot; might
prevent Turkey from accepting peace, by the bombardment ofConstantinople, Admiral Wemyss said that from the point of viewof gun power, the Allied ships available in the Mediterranean coulddeal with the &quot; Goeben &quot; so long as she did not get away, but thatshe had a greater speed than any Allied ships in the Mediterranean.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The First Lord of the Admiralty and the Secretary ofState for War should prepare a memorandum makingsuggestions as to the naval and military conditionswhich should be laid down in the event of Turkeyasking for an armistice.(b.) That the question of the naval, military, and politicalsituations in the event of Turkey&apos;s withdrawal from thewar could only be adequately dealt with by a meeting ofthe Supreme War Council.The War Cabinet took note of the undertaking of the first sea Lord of the Admiralty to despatch the first Dreadnought to the aegean as soon as possible.&quot;Western Front. 3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that hehad seen Marshal Foch on the previous day, who was very pleasedwith the situation on the Western front. There was no doubt thatif October remained fine the enemy would have to retire a long way.The militar- authorities knew of no line to which they could retireso strong as that of the Meuse.In the north the Belgians were making remarkable progressbetween Ypres and Dixmude. They were now, according to latest information, about a mile from Roulers, and if their movementsextended towards Bruges the coast should be disengaged, and itwas probable that we should get Ostend and Zeebrugge back, and&apos; the German flank resting on Holland. The Belgians were,,beingassisted by British forces under General Plumer, and by the French,who had sent six infantry divisions and three cavalry divisions tohelp them. .Further south, between the Scarpe and Cambrai, the Canadianswere having heavy engagements against the Germans, who were fighting well in this district. North of St. Quentin an attack wasmade the previous morning by two American divisions, supportedby two Australian- the American divisions went gallantly forward,but progressed so rapidly without sufficiently mopping up, thatthere were, according to latest reports, large numbers of german troops between the Americans and the Australians. In this district the 40th Division had done exceptionally well, taking 4,000prisoners yesterday. Fxirther attacks were being made to the south,but the weather was so bad yesterday that General Wilson doubted if much had been done. South of Rheims, where the americans were attacking, the roads were now in such a bad state that it wouldnot be possible for any,further movement to be made for some days.General Wilson said that some of the German divisions, particularlyhe Jagers, were fighting splendidly ; other divisions not fightingat all. On the whole, the situation was very hopeful, and, given a fine month, it was impossible to say what progress might be made.It appeared as if the German High Command should have taken adecision to shorten their line some time ago. This, however, hadnot been done, and the German Army had now to stand the shockof attack on too long a line. The number of German divisions was now reduced to 187, and, as it was impossible for them to disengageon their present line, they would have to hold it as best they coulduntil the weather made the ground too bad for further operations.
Belgian Coast. 4. The First Sea Lord of the Admiralty reported that british ships were operating on the Belgian coast, and, by bombarding andother means, were endeavouring to give the idea that a landingwould be made. Admiral Wemyss said that there were signs of evacuation of enemy light craft from the coast, and it was thoughtfrom the reconnaissance made that morning that some of the enemy destroyers had, in spite of the watchfulness of the British ships,managed by slipping up the coast to move into the Bight.5. The First Sea Lord reported that U.S.S. &quot; Tampa,&quot; for some reason unknown, left the convoy to which she was attached on the27th September and had been torpedoed.The British Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean had reported that a British troopship was struck by a torpedo which did not explode, on the 26th September, off Cape Spartivento.Japanese torpedo boats then dropped depth charges, after whichoil and wreckage was seen on the surface, and amongst the wreckagethe air chamber of a broken torpedo.The First Sea Lord said that the weather during the last .fewdays had been extremely bad, causing very heavy seas, and thatmotor launch No. 247, owing to the heavy seas had been drivenashore, only one of the crew surviving out of nine.Food Imports. g ^ar Cabinet had before them the following papers inregard to food importations and feeding stuffs : ,   Memorandum by the Food Controller (Paper G.T.-5788).Memorandum from the Ministry of Shipping (Paper G.T.-5799).Memorandum by the President of the Board of Agricultureand Fisheries (Paper G.T.-5789).Mr. Clynes said that two suggestions had been made wherebytonnage might be saved, namely : (a) the rationing of bread, (h) therestriction of animal feeding-stuffs.As to the rationing of bread, he considered that this would bea very dangerous measure, having regard to the degree of unrest atpresent existing, and the fact that it would be impossible to rationbread equitably as between class and class. For instance, therewere hundreds of thousands of munition and agricultural workers who carried bread with them for their midday meal because theycould not get cooked vegetables, &amp;c. In these circumstances breadcould not be apportioned evenly, like meat.The other course proposed, namely, the restriction of feeding-stuffs, and consequently the increased slaughter of herds, would produce great resentment amongst the farming class. .In this connection, Mr. Prothero endorsed the views of theFood Controller. He said that the farmers in this country were indaily dread of the American packing trade. If once our home-grownmeat supply were cut down, it would take years to recover. the farmers&apos; fear might be an empty one, but none the less it existed inthe, mind of every farmer. If feeding-stuffs were cut down, theresult would be that an enormous number of insufficiently fed cattlemust be killed.With regard to the statement that our Allies had slaughteredtheir herds France to the extent of one-third of her herds, Italy tothe extent of one-fourth-Mr. Prothero said our position was totally different from that of our Allies. We were bound to use our grass-country, because it was the only useful purpose to which it could beput; we were a great meat-eating nation, and a milk-drinkingnation, to an extent to which our Allies were not.In this connection it was stated that, notwithstanding recent-depletion, the French herds, as compared with the population, were greater than the British.
Mr. Long, agreeing with. Mr. Prothero, warned the Cabinet asto the gravity of the milk situation. There was a real shortage of milk, and if herds were to be still further reduced in quality and quantity, owing to increased restriction of feeding-stuffs, there wouldbe a great danger of infantile disease in the large urban areas.Mr. Churchill said that the Inter-Allied Munitions Council, uponwhich he represented the British Government, had been examining the problem of food and munitions imports recently in Paris.They had come to the conclusion that the best plan was to divide the year into two : that, during the first half-year, whilehome-grown cereal stocks were high,munitions should have tonnagepriority over food ; and that, during the second half of the year,after cereal stocks had been run down, food imports should have priority over munitions.He urged that there should be no delay in the ratification ofthis conclusion by the Cabinet, because it was essential that the munition stocks of the Allies, which had been reduced during the summer and autumn campaigns, should be increased duringthe winter in preparation for the next campaign in the followingspring. So far from the new form of open warfare resulting in a smaller expenditure of ammunition, it had had the contrary effect.Recent firings had beaten all previous records ; during fifteen days10,000 tons had been used. As a proof that ammunition had notbeen wasted, an order of Ludendorfs had been found, from whichit appeared that 13 per cent, of the German artillery had been destroyed in a single month, apart from the guns captured.Mr. Churchill then submitted figures in regard to Inter-Alliedmunitions tonnage (Appendix). He understood that, in view of thereduction in nitrate products from Chile, the tonnage availablefor food and munitions would be about 40,000,000 tons ; of which22,000,000 tons would be for food, and 18,000,000 for munitions.He suggested that, dividing^ the year into two, the allocationshould be : 10,000,000 tons for food and 10,000,000 tons for munitions in the first six months ; and 12,000,000 tons for food and,000,000 tons for munitions in the second six months.Sir John Beale was of opinion that the-Ministry of Food couldmeet Mr. Churchill&apos;s views as to this programme for the first four or five months, in view of the food stocks in the country, andpossibly for the first six months, though the figures for the wholehalf year had not been worked out in detail. He would prefer thatthe situation should be reviewed again at the end of six months,when a bigger programme of food imports might be shown to benecessary.Pie pointed out that it was most desirable that, in dealing withthis question of imports, all the British representatives on thevarious Inter-Allied bodies should speak with one voice. Otherwise,if one British Government department criticised the imports of another department at the meetings of these Councils, our Alliesmight reasonably view our importation programmes with jealousyand suspicion.The War Cabinet approved of the allocation of the estimated40,000,000 tonnage, suggested by Minister of Munitions, in thefollowing way : During the first six months of the cereal year FoodMunitions...10,000,000 tons.10,000,000   ,,During the second six monthsFoodMunitions...12,000,0008,000,00040,000,000
They further agreed that the situation should be reviewed again towards the end of the first half-year, when the Ministry ofFood might require a bigger programme.(Initialled).        A. B. L.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,October 1, 1918.
Notes by the Ministry of Munitions on Inter-Allied Munitions Tonnage.1. THE decision come to in Paris to ask for 19,000,000 tons of imports left open the question as to the basis on which orders should be placed.If all the Committees of the Council have to start work again on making entirely new programmes, a delay of six months will be caused, which will nullify the policy ofthe Council to get in munitions during the winter in priority over food. It is therefore necessary that the work which has been done up to the present by the committees should form the basis of orders with practically no change, if it can be arranged.The following is a suggestion as to the way in which this may be done : 2. In view of the reduction in nitrate imports in Chili, the Secretary, MaritimeCouncil, is of the opinion that the tonnage available for food and munitions, on a basisof normal tonnage, can be raised to 40,000,000. It is understood that 22,000,000 for food is the bed-rock figure, leaving 18,000,000 for munitions.It is suggested that the allocation should be 10,000,000 for food and 10,000,000for munitions in the first six months and 12,000,000 for food and 8,000,000 for munitions in the second six months. If this is accepted, the problem is to find animmediate basis for placing orders on the programmes as already formulated, whilekeeping the figures down to 10,000,000 during the next six months.3. It is suggested that the following figures meet the case : (Figures in Thousands.)	Programme as put forward.	Proposed Amendment.Ore Nitrate Pyrites Iron and steel Phosphate rock   .. Other articles Total	3,210 390 621 .3,942 672 2,503	3,210 300 421 3,732 224 2,074	11,338	10,000The basis on which this cut is made is indicated in the following paragraphs :  4. The stocks of nitrate in Europe at the present moment are well over300,000 tons. These stocks could easily be drawn upon to the extent of 90,000 tons.Moreover, there is an undisclosed reserve in Europe in the fact that both France andItaly are including considerable quantities of nitrate for agricultural purposes intheir budgets.5. A million and a quarter of the programmes for the half-year consist ofphosphate rock and pyrites. Very little phosphate rock imported now will affect the harvest of 1919. It is suggested that, in order to get in munitions for next year&apos;campaing, this item should practically be eliminated in view of (a.) The possibility that the war may be continued into 1920; and(&amp;&quot;.) The fact that if it is so continued there is certain to be in that year a verymuch larger tonnage than at present, and this can be used for importingthe food which the phosphate rock is intended to produce in the 1920harvest.It is therefore suggested that the phosphate rock should be cut to one-thirdduring the next six months in each of the three countries&apos; budgets. This will permit a consequential reduction of, approximately, 200,000 tons of. pyrites imported by france and Great Britain, in the proportions of 110,000 by Great Britain and90,000 tons by France.6. As regards iron and steel, it is suggested that the Italian situation would be adequately met by continuing throughout the cereal year the importation which theyare asking for the last quarter of 1918, instead of allowing an increased import from100,000 tons a month this year to 140,000 tons a month next year.APPENDIX.

This would give a relief of 90,000 tons.In all other respects it is suggested that the Iron and Steel Programme should beput through as drafted.There remain 400,000 tons, which it is suggested should be borne by the three countries in proportion to the totals they have put in respectively under the heading of &quot; Miscellaneous Imports&quot; not criticised bv any Committee. This would take230,000 tons from France, 120,000 from Great Britain, and 50,000 from Italy.7. If this general scheme is agreed, it would leave the budgets for the three countries on the following basis for the six months ; the columns marked &quot;A &quot; beingfigures put forward in Paris, those marked &quot; B &quot; are figures now proposed :
