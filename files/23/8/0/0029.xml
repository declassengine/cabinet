WITH reference to Imperial War Cabinet 38, Minute 2, theRepresentatives to War Cabinet had some discussion in regard to the arrangements toLondon. we made in connection with the visit of M. Clemenceau and marshal foch, who were expected to arrive in London on the followingSunday at 11*30 a.m.,* and to stay until the following Wednesdaymorning.The Secretary said that M. Fleuriau, of the French Embassy,had informed him that M. Clemenceau had particularly requested that there should be no official luncheons or dinners. The secretary said that he had notified Colonel Buchan of the forthcoming visit,with a view to the matter being advertised in the newspapers.* Subsequently changed to 2 p.m. M. P. A. H.
The War Cabinet were of opinion that any members of theWar Cabinet who might be in London on the day of the arrival ofM. Clemenceau and Marshal Foch should accompany the PrimeMinister in receiving the visitors at the station.The War Cabinet requested Lord Curzon and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, inconsultation with Lord Stamfordham, to undertake thetask of making the necessary arrangements in connectionwith the forthcoming visit.Moral of the 2. The First Sea Lord said that from a study of various con-German Navy. versations at Rosyth between British and German naval officers,there was no doubt that after the battle of Jutland the moral of theGerman bluejacket was shaken ; from that time onward he had no intention of coming out to sea again. The beginning of the trouble in the German navy dated from the battle of Jutland.Surrender of 3. The First Sea Lord reported that enemy submarines wereGerman continuing to come in, and that by to-day there would be a total of submarines. ,129 submarines. surrendered.   It could now safely be said that,according to a conservative estimate, we had sunk over 200 german submarines. There seemed no doubt that latterly the northernbarrage, of whose value there had never previously been any actualevidence, had accounted for six submarines.Civil AerialTransport.4. The War Cabinet had before them a copy of a letter fromthe Air Ministry to the Secretary to the War Cabinet (paper g.T.-6364), in regard to civil aerial transport. It was stated in theletter that Lord Cave had been consulted as to the propriety of theAir Ministry approaching the Home Affairs Committee on thequestion, and that Lord Cave had expressed the view that, whilethe War Cabinet might possibly decide to delegate the matter tothe Committee, the letter should first be referred to the WarCabinet.The War Cabinet decided To refer the matter to the Home Affairs Committee.Anticipated strike in Electric PowerUndertakings.5. With reference to War Cabinet 492, Minute 14, the War-Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Minister of Labour,dealing with the possibility of a strike by the Electrical TradesUnion (Paper G.T.-6385).Sir David Shackleton said that the Committee which had beendealing with the matter had considered the altered circumstancesoccasioned by the signing of the armistice. The protective measureswhich had previously been taken had been adopted for urgent warreasons, and it was a question for the War Cabinet to decide howfar these measures should be continued during the period of thearmistice. The possibility of a general and sudden strike still remained.The War Cabinet decided that The protective measures approved by the Committee should becontinued for the present, with such modifications as they thought desirable.
Provision of Land 6. With reference to War Cabinet 505, Minute 12, the war for Settlement and    Cabinet had before them the report of Lord Cave&apos;s Committee,o lei   urposes.        which had considered proposals for expediting the acquisition ofland in connection with the scheme prepared by the Committee and approved by the War Cabinet (Paper G.T.-6373).Mr. Prothero said that, while he was willing to accept theproposals of the Committee and to make the best of them, he wasvery much afraid that the widespread adoption of the scheme wouldbe seriously handicapped by the proposals that the County councils should bear up to 25 per cent, of any deficiency between income andexpenditure. If a definite loss of this kind were thrown on theCounty Councils, wdio are the trustees of the ratepayers, it was unlikely that they would be very energetic in pushing the scheme.He understood that the President of the Local Government Board-was coming to much the same conclusion in connection with thefinance ohjhis Housing Bill. In his (Mr. Prothero&apos;s) view, the financial proposals with regard to possible deficits should be exactly parallelin the case of housing and land settlement. There should be thesame sort of liability in the two cases. It might, for example, bepossible to arrange that at the end of seven years a&quot;valuation shouldbe made, and any loss during that period should be written off bythe State.Mr. Montagu said that he concurred with Mr. Prothero in thinking that in the rural areas the County Councils would be veryslow to take up the question of settling soldiers on the land if they knew in advance that they would have to bear the loss of suchundertakings.It was pointed out that the cases of housing and land settlement where not exactly parallel. In the large urban centres the municipalauthorities had a direct inducement to improve the housing of their areas with Government assistance ; but there was not, in the case ofthe settling of soldiers on the land, a similar inducement to the rural authorities.Sir James Dodds said that, with regard to Scotland, Lord Cave&apos;sCommittee had come to the conclusion that the County Councilscould not be used as in England and Wales, because in Scotland theSmall-holding Schemes were immediately under the Board ofAgriculture.Lord Cave pointed out that Mr. Prothero&apos;s scheme removed the motive for economy, because under it one authority would beincurring expenditure and another would be bearing the loss.The War Cabinet decided To ask Lord Cave to reassemble his Committee in order toconsider the proposals now put forward by the Presidentof the Board of Agriculture, and to report to the WarCabinet.Sugar-Beet 7. The President of the Board of Agriculture called attentionCultivation. to the desirability of obtaining Treasury sanction to proposals whichhad been submitted with reference to the cultivation of sugar-beetin this country.The Chancellor of the Exchequer undertook to take an early opportunity of examining the question.8. The War Cabinet had before them a Note by the Secretary(Paper G.T.-6338), submitting that it was a matter of the first importance that the experiences of the present war should beavailable in a practical form for any future war in which, at how-ever distant a date, this country might have the misfortune tobecome involved. Under the authority of the late Government, aletter a copy of which was attached to the Secretary&apos;s Note had&quot;Demobilisation:Proposals forDepartmentalRecords.
been circulated to all Departments and Committees. Since the-advent of the present Government, however, a number of new-Departments and Committees had come into existence which hadnot received the letter. The note now requested the authority ofthe War Cabinet to circulate the said letter to all Departments,whether they had received it previously or not, so that when anydepartmental demobilisation is completed the necessary informationmay be forthcoming.The War Cabinet approved the circulation of the Secretary&apos;s-letter to all Departments of State.Imprisonment ofJohn Maclean.9. With reference to Imperial War Cabinet 39, Minute 5,.when it had been decided that, unless the Irish Executive should raise strong objections, John Maclean and Charles Milne, at presentundergoing sentences of imprisonment for offences under theDefence of the Realm Act, should be at once released as an act ofgrace on the signing of the armistice, the Secretaiy to the WarOabinet stated that he had been informed by the Private Secretaryto the Secretary of State for the Colonies that Air. Long had beenin telephonic communication with Lord French, who had expressed his concurrence in the decision of the Imperial War Cabinet, andhis conviction that the Chief Secretary would also raise no objectionto effect being given to that decision. Lord Frenches views hadbeen communicated by Air. Barnes the previous evening to theSecretaiy for Scotland, who, it was understood, was taking thenecessary action.The War Cabinet took note of the above information.representation ofthe Air ministry on the DecorationsCommittee  appointed by theWar Cabinet.10. The War Cabinet had before them a copy of letterNo. B 5770, C.A.S., dated 1st October, 1918 (G.T.-6336), from theAir Ministry to the Secretary, War Cabinet, requesting that the master-General of Personnel and the Secretary of the Air Ministrymight be substituted for the Director of Air Personnel Servicesupon the Committee constituted under Alinute 10 of War cabinet meeting 473.The War Cabinet decided- -To approve the proposed substitution.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,November 29, 1918.(Initialled)A.
