WITH reference to War Cabinet 486, Minute 11, Mr. Barnessaid that during the Debate which had taken place in the House ofCommons on the - 18th October, on the subject of the increases inSeparation Allowances, approved by the War Cabinet (War Cabinet486, Minute 11) he had, in view of the criticism directed against thedecision that these increases should not come into force until thefirst pay day in January 1919, made a promise that this question should be submitted to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and to theSoldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Pay Committee for reconsideration. TheCommittee had had this matter under consideration, and had agreedto recommend to the War Cabinet that the flat rate increases shouldbe payable as from the first pay day in November 1918. Theestimated increased cost of this alteration of date would be approxi-mately 1,500,OOOL for the three services.    There had also been
considerable criticism on the phrasing of the Special Grants Com-mittee&apos;s Regulation dealing with the supplemental grant payable tochildless wives, and it had been agreed by the Committee that itwas desirable that the sole condition of the receipt by a childlesswife of the supplemental sum of 6s. 6d. should be that she was notearning wages.The War Cabinet approved of the recommendations of theSoldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Pay Committee, and authorisedMr. Barnes to make a statement in the House of commons that afternoon after questions, dealing with the decisionsof the Government on the two points which had been putforward by him.Alternative 2.
