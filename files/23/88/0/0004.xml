THE DUKE OP 1. The Prime Minister recalled that on the 8thGLOUCESTER.October last the late King&apos;s Private Secretary had cabinet Papersfor. written to the Secretary to the Cabinet stating that(Previous &quot;The King is anxious that the Duke ofReference: York, as Heir to the Throne, shouldCabinet 57 be kept supplied with as many official(36), Con- papers as possible.&quot;elusion 22.)The proposal was that the Duke of York should receivecopies of Cabinet and other Papers sent to the King,but not Cabinet Minutes, and that he need not betroubled with Cabinet Committee Papers.    This proposal,the Prime Minister recalled, he had approved, and his decision had subsequently been taken note of with approval by the Cabinet at the Meeting referred to inthe margin.The Prime Minister said that the King now wishedthat the same procedure should be followed in the caseof the Duke of Gloucester, namely, that His royal highness should receive the Cabinet and other Paperssent to the King, but not Cabinet Minutes or CabinetCommittee Papers.The Prime Minister added that under the RegencyAct, 1937, the Duke of Gloucester, as the person nextin succession to the Throne of full age, would becomeRegent in the events provided for in the Act.    Thiswas a strong ground for acceding to the proposed, and&apos;       one, of course, which was not applicable before thepassage of the Regency Act.The Cabinet agreed  To approve the proposal that H.R.H. the duke of Gloucester should receive theCabinet and other Papers sent to The King,but not Cabinet Minutes or Cabinet CommitteePapers.Q The Prime Minister said that hewould take an early opportunityto mention to The King theCabinet&apos;s decision as to thesehighly secret Papers.
2.    The Secretary of State for. Foreign affairs read to the Cabinet a telegram (Appendix i) addressed .to the Prime Minister by the President of the BasqueGovernment at Bilbao, emphasising the smallness ot the risk run by merchant ships in entering or leavingBilbao, leaving it to the Prime Minister to lay the allegations in the telegram before the House ofCommons and recalling the assistance given by Basqueshipping to Great Britain during the Great War.That telegram had probably been published, or wouldhave reached the Leader of the Opposition in Parlia-ment, and was a factor that had to be taken intoconsideration in connection with the Debate the same afternoon.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out thatthe telegram wras not entirely a question of facts,since in the last paragraph an appeal was made toBasquethe British Government to intervene on the:j   side inmemory of former assistance.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that exactinformation was difficult to obtain.    So far as itwent, however, the information at the disposal of theAdmiralty was that the coast defences of Bilbao wereold and not effective, and that at Santander therewere no fixed defences worth considering.    In Santandermines had been laid at one time for purposes ofdefence by the Government forces.    It was uncertainwhat mines had been laid by the insurgents.    He thoughtthethat for purposes of/Debate the most solid ground wasto be found in the damage that would be done to theprinciple of non-intervention if we were to force our ships into Spanish ports. There would be difficultiesif we based ourselves too much on the dangers fromnines.
The Prime Minister recalled that in his statement in Parliament on Monday, April 12th, hehad said that -&quot;In addition, on account of the laying of nines &quot;by both sides in the approaches to Bilbao, there is novgrave risk toany ship seeking to enter the harbourunless nine-sweeping is first carriedout within Spanish territorial waters. 11The First Lord said that the Admiralty had notbeen able to confirm the laying of mines by bothsides in the approaches to Bilbao.The Home Secretary said that the Prime minister had asked him to be ready to speak in, and possibly to open, the Debate on the same afternoon.    Withthe permission of the First Lord of the Admiralty hehad seen two Officers from that Department and had obtained a good deal of information bearing on thesubject.    He gathered that there had been some mine-laying by the insurgent forces at Bilbao.    It was quite true .that a number of ships had reached theport without striking a mine.    There was no doubt,however, that General Franco&apos;s Government possessednine-layers and had laid nines.    The Governmentforces had sweepers, and he had been informed that three of these had been blown up, - which confirmed the existence of mines.   Mine-layers often operatedat night, and to hinder this searchlights had beenprovided by the Government forces.    The naval officers he had consulted had insisted that theBritish Fleet could of course force a way intoBilbao, or any other Spanish port, but only if mine-sweepers were used.    They had hesitated to express an opinion as to whether the use of nine-sweeperswould be an infringement of non-intervention.   Hethought, however, that it would be safe to say inParliament that there had been both mining and\ &apos;    -3-
socounter-rrining along the Basque coast, and he onlyproposed to mention the subject as an illustrationon the issue of not taking sides in the dispute.He recalled that in the early part of the war theGovernment forces had predominated at sea.    the government&apos;s seamen had then got rid of their Officersand superiority at sea had passed to General Franco1sforces.    Last summer the Government forces had tried to carry out a blockade of the Spanish coast in GeneralFranco1s possession, and of Spanish Morocco. At thattime, when the conditions were exactly the reverse ofthose now prevailing, British merchant ships had been4-0Id to call at Gibraltar for ^LnctruotioaG before proceeding to Mediterranean ports in Spain or to spanish Morocco.    The nature of the instructions issued at Gibraltar had been as follows:-(l) If proceeding to a port which was foundto be watched, they were advised not toproceed:(2),If, notwithstanding that advice, theyattempted to enter such ports, theywe re told that they went at their ownrisk.The Board of Trade had seen that the necessary warningswere issued to shipping.    He proposed to use thisprecedent in dealing with the question in Parliament.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreedthat this line would be very useful..    Later in the debate, however, the question would be raised as to1   what should be the attitude of our Navy in the eventof a merchant ship deciding to proceed to Bilbaocontrary to our advice.    Protection in territorial waters would probably not be expected, but the question would be raised as to whether, in view of the PrimeMinister1s statement, such ships would not be givenprotection on the high seas.   What, he asked, wouldbe the answer9
Q1The First Lord of the Admiralty recalled thedecision of the Cabinet at the Meeting referred to*, in the margin, that he was to instruct the naval authorities on the Spanish coast -&quot;That all Naval protection is to be withdrawn from British merchant ships which disregard the wishes of HisMajesty&quot;s Government that they shouldnot proceed to the Bilbao area andthat British merchant ships should beso informed if the occasion arises.&quot;The Prime Minister drew attention to the following passage in the Admiralty&apos;s instructions to the naval authorities&quot;as regards Bilbao the decision is thatthe Government will continue to take steps to dissuade merchant ships fromproceeding thither, and all naval protection is to be withdrawn fromships which disregard these wishes.You should act accordingly and so informany ships concerned if the occasion arises.&quot;The view was expressed that if these instruc-tions had to be produced in the House of Commons theyrriigbtf.be argued   to be contrary to the Prime Minister&apos;sstatement in the House of Commons on April 12th thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government &quot;cannot tolerate any inter-ference with British shipping at sea&quot;, and that itwould be necessary either to change those instructionsor to define the manner in which they should becarried out.It was suggested that, notwithstanding the warning of the dangers of entering Bilbao, it would benecessary, in view of the Prime Minister&apos;s statement,to give protection to a ship that decided to neglectthe warning.The First Lord of the Admiralty asked whether thatmeant that the Navy was expected to escort merchant ships disregarding the warning as far as territorial waters and then to allow them to be captured withinthe three-mile limit?   He repeated the objections of
the Admiralty to that course, which he had emphasisedat the last Meeting.It was suggested that it would not he necessaryto escort merchant ships which sailed in disregard of the warning, hut that if a ship, after sailing,was molested or menaced on the high seas and sent asignal asking for assistance, this should not be withheld.    The analogy was quoted of the police, who might warn people that a certain locality was dangerousbut would not refuse their aid if they got into diffi-culties by neglecting the warning.The First Lord of the Admiralty informed theCabinet that at the present moment His Majesty^ s ships could operate fairly freely off the north coast of Spain, but a notice had just been issued that thecoast was to be mined much more heavily, and if this occurred he might find it necessary to ask theCabinet to approve far more elaborate arrangements,including a Flotilla of Destroyers to accompanyH.M.S. HOOD, and Mine-sweeping Flotillas.    Two german submarines were reported off the north coast of Spain,and it was impossible to exclude the risk that incertain contingencies either a German submarine mightfor a Spanish,be sunk in mistake^,&apos; or that a British ship might be attacked by a German submarine.The question ,was asked as to wliether it was reasonable to ask a British man-of-war to run therisk of being mined in order to protect a ship that had disregarded a British Government warning0The Home Secretary thought that it was possibleto reconcile the two sides of the Prime Minister&apos;sstatement on April 12th, namely, the risks from mines and bombing in Bilbao harbour and its approaches, andour refusal to tolerate interference with British1shipping at sea.
He mentioned another difficulty that was likely tohe raised, namely, a request for publication of the communication made by the Captain of H.M.S. BLANCHEto trading vessels at St.  Jean de Luz.    &quot;The Times&quot;report had spoken of &quot;orders&quot; and not &quot;advice&quot;.    Heread extracts from the letter sent by the Captain ofH.M.S. BLANCHE to the Captains of merchant ships at st..  Jean de Luz on Saturday, April 10th, which was definitely in the nature of an order, though it hadbeen cane-lied verbally on the following day on the   &apos;receipt of instructions from the Admiralty.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that such difficulties were almost bound to arise when a very heavy responsibility was imposed on a relatively juniorOfficer.    As soon as he had seen the letter he had given instructions for a more appropriate cbmmunica-tion.There was general agreement that no blame couldattach to the Captain of H.M.S. BLANCHE for hismessage.The Home Secretary then produced the messagesissued from the Board of Trade, which were in thenature of a warning and an expression of theGovernment1 s desire.    He thought there should be nodifficulty in dealing with any such question thatmight arise.Questions were then raised as to whether freshinstructions were to be sent to the Naval authorities on the coast of Spain on the question of protectingships which ignored Government advice;   also as towhether a further communication should be sent toGeneral Franco&apos;s Government; and whether our previous warning to General Franco should becommunicated to Parliament.
The First Lord of the Admiralty insisted on theimportance of giving precise instructions to the naval authorities as to how they were to interpret and carry out the Governments wishes.    He did not dissent from the general desire of the Cabinet that protectionshould be given on the high seas, even to a ship that had disregarded the advice of the Government, providedthat the Naval Authorities were told how to carry outthat policy in the neighbourhood of Bilbao.    They mustknow whether they were to escort a ship up to thethree-mile limit and then let it go or not.    In dealingwith the matter in Parliament he would prefer to keepas closely as possible to the precedent of last summer,when the Spanish Government had been the blockadingforce;     otherwise, in view of the financial attractionsof carrying cargo to the Spanish coast, merchant shipstrusting in a promise of protection on the high seasmight run the risk of disregarding the Governmentsadvice -The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs recalled that a short time ago the question had been raised ofcarrying out further humanitarian work along the northcoastuof Spain, using Destroyers for the purpose, andthe Admiralty had desired to avoid using men-of-warin the future owing to the danger from nines. this could be used to reinforce the argument as to the dangerat the Spanish ports.The First Lord of the Admiralty was anxious thatthe Home Secretary should realise and, if necessary,make clear that the Navy was capable of.carrying out any operations on the coast of Spain and of forcingits way into any port, but that, in view of develop-ments in mining, and so forth, it might involve much larger preparations, such as he had already indicated.
The Home Secretary said that he proposed to make this clear.    He proposed also, after quoting theMediterranean precedent, to ask what would he theattitude of the Parliamentary Opposition if, later on,the Government naval forces should get the upper handand there should he a proposal to use the British Navyto f^orce the Spanish Government blockading force to admit British ships to some insurgent port such asPerrol.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thendrew attention to telegram No.99 from Hendaye, in whichit was stated that the Military Governor had found the message sent after the Cabinet on Sunday night obscure.&quot;He fully understood protection on the high seas, but&quot;he asked what would be our attitude if the insurgent&quot;men-of-war either prevented British ships from&quot;entering Spanish territorial waters by mance uvring&quot;round them, or fired upon any British ships they&quot;found within the three-mile limit.    I could give him&quot;no answer to this&quot;.He proposed to reply that he was not prepared to give general Franco any undertaking to refrain from protect-ing British ships.    On the contrary, he would like to request him to leave them alone and to add that weshould hold General Franco responsible for any damage to British ships, whether inside or outside territorial waters.    He would also like to make public the natureof this communication.It was suggested that to make, it public might encourage British ships to risk running the blockadeto Bilbao in the expectation that they would getcompensation.The President of the Board of Trade thought, however that on the whole British shipowners would not beaffected in their decision by such a statement.After some discussion the Chancellor of theExchequer suggested that, instead of holding general franco responsible, it would be better to say &quot;These
instructions are without prejudice to any claim we might make on General Franco for loss&quot;.The Home Secretary thought that the answer toGeneral Franco should be to repeat what the PrimeMinister had said in the House of Commons.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs suggested that to this should be added -&quot;This advice to British vessels does not affect the ultimate responsibility forany damage which may be done to any british vessel which nay disregard suchadvice11.The First Lord of the Admiralty raised thequestion of what was to be said as to ports on theBasque coast other than Bilbao.    Apparently therewas rather less risk at present at Santander,   butif British ships were sent to Santander the Spaniardscould   transfer some of their ships from Bilbao toprevent them entering.The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested to say&quot;When conditions are the same as atBilbao the same instructions will apply&quot;.The President of the Board of Trade said thatthe conditions at Santander were in fact quite different from those at Bilbao.    On Tuesday, April -13th, the following advice had been given to owners:-&quot;Government warn against proceeding toBilbao.    Position as regards enteringother Basque ports is still uncertainand it is not possible to say how soonfurther information about this will beavailable.&quot;He was anxious not to take action which would resultin hampering British shipping in Spanish trade.    Atpresent 62 British ships were so engaged.    There were also about 52 German ships similarly engaged, theships of both countries being scattered at ports allround the coast.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested thatthe question of what ports should he treated in thesame way as Bilbao should be decided from time totime by the Admiralty and Board of Trade in consulta-tipn.. This was agreed to.The Cabinet agreecr  (a) To approve the general line proposedby the Home Secretary for his opening   .speech in the Parliamentary Debate:that he should make full use of the ^cUst^-       precedent of the/inotruotiono issued to British shipping last summer and &apos;&quot;&apos;autumn when the&quot;Government forces were endeavouring to conduct a blockade:and that he should emphasise theimportance of avoiding any actioncalculated to upset the internationalpolicy of non-intervention:(b) That in the course of his speech theHome Secretary should be authorisedto make a statement to the following effect::-&quot;We are communicating to general franco.direct to inform him that, asthe Prime Minister said on Monday,His Majesty1s Government cannotrecognise or concede belligerentrights, and they cannot tolerateany interference with british shipping at sea.    And we have addedthat any advice we have given toBritish vessels does not^ of course,affect the ultimate responsibilityfor any damage which may be done toany British vessel even if itdisregardedsuch adviceii(The same situation arose in southern Spain last autumn and shipping followed the Govern-ment advice.)(c) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should make an immediate corarnuni-cation to General Franco on the lines of(b):(d) That the First Lord of the admiralty should consider the issue of fartherinstructions to the Briti&amp;i naval authorities on the Spanish coast as tothe carrying out of the Cabinet&apos;s policy:(e) That at -ports where the conditions aresimilar to those existing at Bilbao,the same instructions should apply, andthat the question of be so treated shouldto time by the first and the President ofin consultation.which ports shouldbe decided from timeLord of the admiralty the Board of Trade
3SrPE FIVE-POWER 3.   The Cabinet took note of a&apos; Memorandum by the3 C INFERENCE. , ,    NNSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (C.P.-110 (37))rjelgium.furnished in accordance with the Conclusion mentioned(Previous in the margin, circulating to his colleagues the reference:Cabinet 13 following Papers showing the present position of the(37), Con-clusion 9 (c).) question of the release of Belgium from her obligationFR.It(Sjy. to renaer assistance to France under the Treaty of locarno and the Text of Proposals of March, 1936:-(i) A Minute by Sir 0.

QAIR RAID PRE- 4e    The Cabinet had before them a Note by theCAUTIONS.Minister for Co-ordination of Defence (CP.-112 (37))financial aspects of. on the Financial Aspects of Air Raid Precautions, towhich he appended an extract from the Draft Minutes(previous reference: of the 37th Meeting of the Sub-Committee on DefenceCabinet 13(37), Con- Policy and Requirements, who, in accordance with the elusion 11 (b).)Conclusion mentioned in the margin, had consideredconcrete proposals on the subject contained in aMemorandum by the Home Secretary (D. P.R.-18l).The recommendations of the Sub-Committee are reproduced as Appendix II to these Minutes.The Minister for Co-Ordination of Defencemade a statement to the Cabinet on the conclusionsof the Defence Policy and Requirements Sub-Committee.Dealing first with Part IV of the HomeSecretaryfs memorandum D.P.R.181, he said theCommittee had agreed that the somewhat vague proposal that  5,000,000 should be allotted in the firstinstance for safeguarding the vital services of thecountry could not be approved at the present timeand that a special Sub-Committee of the Committee ofImperial Defence should be set up as soon aspossible to examine and report on this question.The greater part of the Home secretary memorandumhe said was concerned with the basis on which theAir Raid Precautions Department should conduct negotiations with the local authorities.      In thisconnection, he drew particular attention to conclusion 1 (d) where it was recommended that thegeneral preparedness should be worked out by localauthorities on the basis that they may assume aperiod of warning to complete their precautionary measures before the outbreak of war, but that thekm
length of the period was liable to vary according tothe circumstances of the locality and that it was unnecessary to communicate it to the localauthorities.     He then referred to recommendation (3)that the Home Secretary should be authorised to open negotiations on the bases approved by the defence policy and Requirements Sub-&quot;Commit tee either withthe various associations representing local governmentauthorities or, in the first instance, with localauthorities selected by the Home Secretary, afterconsultation with the Ministers concerned.     TheMinister then said that he had been thinking thematter over and doubts had entered his mind as towhether it was within the power of the existing organisation in the Home Office to make all these arrangements.     He paid a high tribute to the work ofthe Air Raid Precautions Department, but pointed outthat other Departments were very much concerned.     Forexample, hundreds of thousands of beds had to beprovided, which would be a very formidable task forthe Home Office.     He was wondering if it was not necessary to establish an organisation under theMinistry of Health.     He had also in mind that someof the work might be delegated to an organisation on voluntary lines, more especially as some parts of thecountry were virtually immune from liability to heavy attack.     If the attempt were made to   equip  the whole country on the basis of the same risk as applied inLondon, it would involve the provision of enormousapparatus, much of which would never be used.     would it not be better to make preparations in districtswhich were liable to draw serious attack and to leavethe rest of the country less prepared?     Another- 14 -
illustration of the magnitude of the problem as atpresent envisaged was that no less than 8,000 medicalmen were required for these services.     He did not suggest that the negotiations  writh-the localauthorities should be delayed, but he thought thesematters ought to be looked into.The Home Secretary agreed that there mustbe no unnecessary delay, but the local authorities would be anxious to have a certain amount ofdef initen.es s.The Minister of Health urged that beforemeeting the local authorities, it was necessary forthe Government to have their plans worked&apos;out*-irL  -greater detail.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he had not realised that the Minister for Co-Ordination ofDefence was going to make these proposals as he had intended to propose something on the same lines himself.He had been impressed by a report to the Committeeof Imperial Defence on medical arrangements in timeof war (CI.D.1319.B) in which very heavy casualties were assumed and a suggestion was made for thecreation of a central authority.-.      There was,however, a reservation by the Air Ministry&apos;representative who suggested that some GovernmentDepartment,   e.g. the Ministry of Health, should undertake the main responsibility.     He thought thathospital accommodation would have to be controlled by a central body like the Ministry of Health becausealthough the casualties would not be the same allover the country, they might extend far beyond the capacity of particular areas.     Some authoritytherefore was needed to decide where the injuredshould be taken.     The whole aspect of Air Raid
Precautions so far as the Cabinet was concerned was now changing.     At first, the issues had been confined to such matters as gas masks, fire brigadesand police, and, consequently, responsibility hadbeen allocated to the Home Office which was mainly concerned.     He admired the Home Office work, but now the responsibility was tending to pass more andmore to local authorities.In these circumstances, he suggested thata Committee of officials should be set up to repor.tas to the adjustment of responsibility, the effect ofsuch enquiry being probably to bring the Ministry ofHealth more into the picture.The Chancellor of the Exchequer addedthat he had some corrections to make to the draft minutes of the Defence Policy and Requirements Sub-Committee which had been circulated to the Cabinet.The Prime Minister agreed in the idea ofthe Committee.The Cabinet agreed:(a) That negotiations with the localauthorities should be suspendedpending reconsideration by aCommittee of the adjustment ofthe Departmental responsibilityconnected with Air RaidPrecautions:(b) That the Chancellor of theExchequer should draft the composition and terms of reference of the Committee in consultationwith the Minister for Co-Ordinationof Defence, the Home Secretary,the Minister of Health and theSecretary of State for Scotland,
MILK POLICY.Pasteurisation.Private Billspromoted byGlasgow andPoole.(previous reference:Cabinet 58(36), Con-clusion 9).5.    The Lord Privy Seal raised, as a matter of urgency,  a question arising out of Private Billsnow before the House of Lords promoted by the corporations of G-lasgow and Poole, both of which sought to make the pasteurisation of milk fpr salefor public consumption oompulsory.     He read to hiscolleagues the following draft statement of policywhich he had agreed with the Secretary of State forScotland and the Ministers of Health and Agricultureand Fisheries:-&quot;The Government intend to bring forwardlong-term legislation dealing with milkpolicy in the near futureo&quot;He felt that before making a statement cf such importance he ought to consult the Cabinet.      By the term &quot;in the near future&quot; he contemplated next session of Parliament.     No action would be practicable in the present Session.The Cabinet authorised:The Lord Privy Seal to announce theGovernment&apos;s intention to bring forward long-term legislation dealingwith milk policy in the near future.
THE MARRIAGE 6.

After some discussion, the Cabinet agreed:(a) that members of the Governmentshould be free to vote but not to speak on the Bill;(b) that members of the Cabinet should inform the Parliamentary Secretariesor Under-Secretaries of theirrespective Departments of thisdecision, which should also becommunicated to Ministerial headsof Departments who are not membersof the Cabinet.

APPENDIX    I.ORDS BILBAO PRESIDENCIA 33014 0330 ETAT.Mr. Stanley Baldwin, House of Commons, London.The Basque Government fighting for democracy andBasque liberty is compelled to draw your attention to thefollowing facts of interest in the forthcoming debate inthe House of Commons.     First no foreign or Spanish shiphas ever been detained or fired upon in Basque territorial waters.      Second there are no ilxLnes laid either by theenemies or by us in the entrance or exit of the port ofBilbao.      Third in the first fortnight of April therehave been twenty-six inward and thirty-two outward sailingsin the port of Bilbao all without molestation or difficultyin our territorial waters.      Fourth every night armed trawlers aided by powerful searchlights from the shorekeep watch over the Port of Bilbao.      It is enough to demonstrate the efficiency of this service to state thatthroughout the civil war no commercial vessel has been mined in our port or territorial waters.     Fifth,powerful coastal batteries keep units of the rebel fleetover fifteen miles from the shore aided by our destroyers and submarines.      Sixth, even to-day, April 13th, severalships including British Ship &quot;Olavus&quot; have left port ofi   Bilbao without molestation.      Seventh, guaranteeing aswe do safety of British ships within our own waters forcedto assume that if they are unwilling enter port of Bilbaoit is due to inability of British fleet to protect them on the High Seas,      The Basques therefore appeal to yoursense of justice and fairplay to lay these facts before
the House of Commons.     Do not forget that Basqueshipping worked for Great Britain throughout the difficult days of the Great War when the danger thatexisted was real.     I am sure that the Basques candepend upon your right spirit of Justice and Friendshipto a country as ours small hut democratic and independent.Thank you.Jose Antonio De Aguirre.President of the Government of Euzkadi.
APPENDIXZTFinancial Aspects of Air Raid Precautions.    %Recommendations of the Sub-Committee on Defence Policy and Requirements.(1) That the organisation of Air Raid Precautions should be governed by thefollowing principles : (a) Measures for safeguarding the civil population against the effects of air attack must be organised locally. The Government will issue generalinstructions based on expert study of the problems, will be ready togive technical and administrative advice, and to afford financial assist-ance up to the limits indicated in the conclusions that follow. But, theabove activities on the part of the Central Government cannotcompensate for the failure of any district which is liable to attack totake effective measures on its own account.(6) It is not possible to contemplate, in connection with civil air raid pre-cautions, such a state of preparedness in all respects in time of peace,as is adopted for the pre-war preparedness of the fighting services.(c) Air raid precautions may properly be initiated, and pre-emergency arrangements for air raid precautions may properly be augmented,during a period of tension, without prejudice to the peaceful settle-ment of any negotiations that may be in progress, and independently of any active defence preparations.(d) In view of (b) and (c) above, the general preparations in the sphere ofpassive defence should (subject to the exceptions specified in (g) and(h) below) be worked out by local authorities on the basis that they mayassume a period of warning to complete their precautionary measuresbefore the outbreak of Avar. The length of this period will vary according to the probability, or othei&apos;wise, of the locality in question being subjected to air attack at the outset of hostilities, and will bedetermined by the Government on the merits of each case. It is unnecessary, at the present time at any rate, that the length of theperiod be communicated to Local Authorities.(e) The scale of preparedness to be aimed at by local authorities, both beforeand during the warning period, will also depend on the liability of thearea in question to early attack, and will also be determined by theGovernment on the merits of each case.(/) It is recognised that, in deciding to work on an assumed warning period,there is a risk of that warning being given on the threat of anemergency which may not materialise, with the result that expenditurereserved until the warning period or a large part of it may thus. be undertaken unnecessarily. But, this risk is to be accepted aspreferable to the only possible alternative, which is, to incur the sameexpenditure, or more, in advance.[g) Plans for emergency fire brigade measures for London and other areasmost liable to incendiary attack must be worked out to secure thehighest possible degree of preparedness. In these services and areas the provision of equipment and appliances cannot be postponed untilthe warning period.(h) The principle of the warning period does not apply to plans for thedistribution of civilian respirators. These must be prepared on theassumption that the period for the completion of their distribution isa matter of hours and not days.; ;,   [14992-1]
(2) That, so far as peace-time expenditure is concerned : (a) The Government should be prepared to make a contribution towards thecost of local authorities&apos; air raid precautions and emergency fire brigade measures, so far as their schemes, and the contemplatedexpenditure thereon, are approved by the Secretary of State for HomeAffairs, after detailed examination by the Home Office, in the light ofthe scale and degree of preparedness which is considered appropriate to each case (vide Conclusions 1 (d) and (e) above).(b) That the general basis on which the Exchequer assistance should be giventowards the various services (apart from items already accepted as anational charge) should be as follows :  (i) Staff, organisation and maintenance costs, and training, storage and mother .s accommodation not specially excepted.60 per cent, of approved expenditure,(ii) Protection of or precautions in buildings housing public services which would:-have- to be maintained as part of the air raidprecautions, or emergency fire brigade organisations.-60 per cent, of approved expenditure, or, in the case ofexisting grant-aided services, the ordinary grant,(rii) Provision or adaptation of buildings to provide first-aid posts,anti-gas cleansing accommodation at depots of A.U.P. Services,auxiliary fire stations and fire posts, :&amp;c.60 per cent, of approved expenditure.(iv) Training&apos;of auxiliary firemen.   Grant per man trained at- 3, ora rate to be fixed.(v) Accumulation of equipment for emergency fire fighting and air raid precautions services (over arid-above peace-time require-ments) (including -possible provision for warning signals andfor extinction or obscuration of-street lighting).60 to 100 per cent, (generally by-way of provision in kind),according to whether the article does or does not serveany useful purpose in peace time.(vi) Provision of supplementary water supplies for emergency firefighting. (Not including expenditure by the water undertakingitself.)Normally 60 per cent.(3) That the Secretary of State for the Home : Department should beauthorised to open negotiations on the basis of the preceding conclusion either with the various associations representing local government authorities or, in thefirst instance, with Local Authorities selected by,.the Home Secretary afterconsultation with the Ministers concerned.(i) That the extent to which the Secretary of State Lor Scotland should be associated with the Secretary of State for the Home /Department in the abovenegotiations should be left to the Ministers concerned.(5)&apos;That no public-announcement of. the Government^ intentions as regardsexpenditure on air raids (precaution; preparations should be , made until thenegotiations with the local government authorities have taken place.(6) That so -far as.immediately pre-war expenditure is concerned, it shouldbe expected that, :except as regards existing, grant-aided -services, increasedExchequer assistance will be given towards the-cost of completing the air raidprecautions1 schemes in the warning period.i (7)&apos; That, *so far-as-war time expenditure is-concerned, financial and other problems involved, should be left for discussion at some future date.&apos; (8)&apos; That payment of compensation for injury,,to Air llaid Precautionpersonnel is part of a wider question and should he (reserved for separate consideration by the Chancellor of .the Exchequer,-the Secretary of State for theHome Department and-the President of -the Board of, Trade (who -is concernedfronithe point of tviewof&apos;compensation for material damage) and:further report.(9) That a special Sub-Committee of-the Committee of imperial defence should be set up as soon as possible, to examine and report on the whole questionof the measures that should be taken, and the expenditure that would be involved,
to ensure the maintenance and safeguarding of those public services which arevital to the effective prosecution of war and the life of the community.e.g., electricity, water, &amp;c.(10) That the composition and terms of reference of the above Sub-Committeeshould be left to the decision of the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, inconsultation with the Home Secretary and other Ministers principally concerned.(11) That the question of the provision of 500 million sand bags as a pro-tection against blast and splinters from high explosive bombs, should be referredto the Principal Supply Officers Committee organisation, for urgent considerationfrom the supply aspect and early report.(12) That the above recommendations together with Paper No. D.P.R. 181and the minutes of the discussion should be submitted to the Cabinet in accordancewith Cabinet 13 (37), Conclusion 11 (b).2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,April 8. 1937.
