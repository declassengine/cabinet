SPAIN.. 1,    The Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsSituation on aaid that the main event since the last Meeting ofthe WorthCoast. the Cabinet had been General Franco&apos;s offensiveSuggested. against Bilbao.    The result of this had been aArmistice.request from the Basque Government for protection(Previous to be given on the high seas to ships carryingReference:Cabinet 19 refugees from Bilbao.    A Cabinet Committee had(.37).  Con-clusion 2.) decided to approve, subject to two main conditions,F.K.Z^(2r/)z,3.   namely,  that the refugees should be selectedimpartially and. under Consular control.Another event had been the bombing of Guernica.The American Amba.ssa.dor had. informed him that thelatter event had been received with the utmost horrorin America., where it was regarded, as a practice forquestion of attacks on civil populationsthe bombing-of London and Paris.    The      /     had been raised at the Non-intervention Committee.    It wasuntrue, as stated in certain newspapers, that theGerman Ambassador had. refused, to discuss the matter.He himself had. seen the Ambassadors of the principalpowers before the meeting of the Committee.   They hadall agreed that the question of the bombing of thecivil population should be discussed, except theGerman Ambs.ssa.dor, who had asked for time to considerthe matter, though he had. not refused, to discuss it.He himself had replied that the meeting of theCommittee had already been postponed to give himfurther time.    At the meeting of the Committee onthe previous day everyone had. agreed that the matter should be discussed, except  the German Ambassador,who had. again not refused, but had suggested that thescope of the discussion should be widened to includeother forros of ill-treatment of the civil populationbesides bombing.   On the suggestion of the french ambassador the &quot;?arl of Plymouth had undertaken to try and put forward some proposals on procedure atthe next meeting.
Another event that had taken place in Spain was an outbreak at Barcelona, where the anarchists were reported to be getting the upper hand and the eyaeua-tion of foreigners was ^eing considered.In the circumstances described above, in which attention was concentrated mainly on humanitarianaspects of Spanish affairs, the Secretary of State forAffairsForeign/said that he had not. found the moment opportune for initiating a joint effort by the Powers concernedin the direction of an armistice, as contemplated bythe Cabinet at the Meeting referred to in the margin.The Cabinet endorsed the Secretary of State&apos;attitude.
SPAIN. 2. In the course of the discussion on the precedingproposed Evacua- item the Minister of Health asked if any informationtion of children from Bilbao to   had been received by the Foreign Office as to thethe UnitedKingdom. evacuation of children from the danger zone.to enquiries had been made from outside/his Department as(previous reference: to 4,000 children who, it was alleged, would, beCabinet 19(37), Con-        arriving in this  country within the next few days,elusion 2 .).B,nL.b The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thoughtthat any such arrival was unlikely.   At present onlySpanish ships were being used, to remove refugees fromBilbao.   The British ships there had only been halfunloaded., owing to the preo ceupa.tions of the availableman-power in the battle.   ,T,he masters of the british ships were anxious to get away, but he gathered thatthe British ships would, not be unloaded for some ten days .The President of the Board, of Trade said that very limited accommodation would be available on board theBritish cargo-boats when they  eoulr&apos; get away.The First Lord/of the Admiralty stated that thereports of the numbers of refugees varied, very much-One suggestion was that the claim that 4,000children were shortly to arrive in this  country wasbeing made in order tq stimulate subscriptions to a fund that was being raised, for this purpose.
3 . The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for India (CP.-124 (37))outlining events that had occurred since the meeting mentioned in the margin in connection with the refusalby the Congress Party in India to form Ministries inthe six Provinces where that Party had obtained amajority in the Legislatures.    The Secretary of Statesupported the Viceroy in, his rejection of the suggest-ion that he should send for the leaders of the Congresswith a view to discussing the difficulty they had found in accepting office, as such discussions wouldbe bound to resolve themselves into a question of concessions on points of substance.    The Secretary ofState was anxious to see that section of the Congresswhich was not out to wreck the Act take office in the six Provinces?    considered that this purpose would best be served not by attempting negotiations at theCentre but by exploiting any opportunity that might occur for contacts between the Governors and theCongress leaders in the Provinces, the issue beingone of provincial autonomy;    and sought the approvalof his colleagues to the policy he was pursuing.The Secretary of State for India made a statement in elaboration of his Memorandum.    The position wasone of sore potential danger.    In five of the Provincesa Government was functioning successfully under thenew Act.    In those Provinces far-reaching programmes were being worked out, and hitherto the Governors had given no indication of interference, though it did not follow that they might not have to interfere later.In the other six Provinces the Government had noParliamentary majority, an* when their Legislaturesmet at the end of six months the probability was thatthey would be defeated.   Nevertheless, in theseProvinces also the Governments were at work on advanced
economic and social programmes.   Meanwhile,  in antici-pation of the end of the six months&apos;  period, therewas much manoeuvring by Congress .   Mr Gandhi had.suggested arbitration on the question of competence.Congress had ignored his own statement in which he had pointed out that if the Governors had. conceded whatwas asked they would have been betraying minoritiesand. other interests which depended, in the last resort,on their powers.    Tt had then been suggested that theSecretary of State for India should repeat an assurance that was alleged to have been given by Sir Samuel Hoarewhen Secretary of State for India.   Sir Samuel Hoare&apos;sstatement had been misrepresented.    What, he had actually said had been repeated, by the Secretary ofState himself in the following passage:-&quot;I gladly repeat what has been said on many occasions by my Right Hon. FriendSir Samuel Hoare., and by many others,namely, that there is no reason why thereserve powers of the Governors should come into play.    Whether they do   -or notmust, o^ course, depend upon the policyand proceedings of the Ministries them-selves, and it is in a spirit of cordialco-operation with, and of sympatheticunderstanding of, the position of the ministries, from whatever Pa.rty theymay be drawn, that the Act. will be administered * .    (Parliamentary Debates.House of Lords. Vol. 104. No .53 . Cols .880-1.)That speech, which had been intended to be concilia-tory, had been criticised as unsympathetic.   To have attempted, to produce a formula which could be regardedas conciliatory woul^ have involved, the use of phraseswhich would have been interpreted in one sense by one party and in another sense by another.   Such a course was ambiguous,, dangerous and dishonest...  He had gone to the limit of conciliation in a reply given by theTinder-Secretary of State for India in the House ofCommons&quot;(Parliamentary Debates;   House of Commons,Volume 323, Column 243: --26 April, 1937):-- 5 -
&quot;I observe, from a recent statement madeas to the intention of the CongressResolution, that the main apprehensionappears to be lest, the Governors should,use their specia.1 powers for detailedinterference in the administration.Let me make it plain that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have no intention of counten-ancing a use of the special powers forother&quot;than the purposes for which parliament intended, them.    It is  certainly not the intention that Governors, bynarrow or legalistic interpretation oftheir own responsibilities, should trenchupon the wide powers which it was thepurpose of Parliament to place in thehands of Ministries and which it is our desire that they should use in furtherance of the programmes which they have advocated&quot;.The retort by Congress to this conciliatory gesturewas to %^e^ra-irt-ar^^-&amp;o -oomc wiodiriTygtidri&apos; oi^^ttl^s^Pe^guardvG-v-^-It &apos;ha&amp;-Ja-eorrdescribed, as utterly inadequate and discourteous.The above had. a dire ct bearing on furthersuggestions that had. been pressed, on him from many quarters, that the Viceroy should send for Mr Gandhi.Here, again, the critics  conveniently ignored state-ments by Mr Gandhi to the Press (l) that he would no* approach the Viceroy, and. (2) that he would not .see the Viceroy if sent for:    for the reason thatthis was the affair of Pundit Nehru, who was thePresident of Congress .   Before the Viceroy could, sendfor Pundit Nehru, however, it behoved him to see ifthere v.&apos;as any ground to form a basis for discussion.There was no such ground, as Pundit Nehru&apos;s attitude was defined in a. Resolution of the previous December,which had been outspoken in its  criticism of thepresent Indian Constitution and of the intention of congress to &quot;put an end to this bogus Act of Parlia-ment&quot;.   There was, therefore, no ground for discussion between the Viceroy an^ the President of Congress.He had been told that in taking up this line he wasignoring the psychology of Congress an^ that a.meeting between the Viceroy and Mr Gandhi would enable them
to evolve a formula which would enable Congress to&quot;walk through the door&quot; (a door which was already wideopen)  to the assumption of office.   A well-meaningQuaker ha^ spent an hour impressing this upon him.He agreed chat such a meeting would have a profoundpsychological effect, though not precisely of thekind that his Quaker friend anticipated.   He warned the Cabinet that, the Indian Civil Service and other services and the Minority Governments in the fiveProvinces, as well as a host of silent Indians whodisliked intensely the extreme policy of Congressbut dared not say so openly, and, finally, the princes, were watching the situation closely.    TheViceroy had warned him that if he were to yield to congress the adhesion of the Princes would be thrownback for a decade.   He then read letters that he hadreceived, from several Governors of Provinces on thissubject, all of which urged that thereshould be noweakness in the matter of the Governors&apos; reserve powers.   While sharing their view, he had thought itdesirable to put the views of those who favouredsending for Mr Gandhi to the Viceroy, and he hadembodied, the gist of Lord Linlithgow&apos;s reply in his memorandum..   The reply amounted to an emphaticrejection of the idea, and he hoped that hiscolleagues in the Cabinet would give him their support for the policy he was pursuing.   The Secretaryof State added, however, that he must leave theCabinet under no illusion.    It seemed inevitable that sooner or later we should come into conflict with the Left Wing of Congress.   Possibly the firmstand we were no^ taking might bring it about sooner.He himself had set forth the Viceroy&apos;s view on. thispoint in his Note.   The Viceroy had warned him that
he might have to take action against Pundit Nehruwith great rapidity.   Recalling the title of one ofthe war books (&quot;Mr Britling Sees it Through&quot;) hesaid that if a clash came the Government would haveto see the situation through.The First Lord of the Admiralty agreed in thegeneral conclusion reached by the Secretary of Statefor India.    It was impossible for the Cabinet to force the Viceroy to see Mr Gandhi and Pundit Nehruagainst his own convictions.   He recalled, however,that the situation need not get acute until September.After that month Supply would come to an end ingix Provinces, and the Governors would, have to declare a breakdown of the Constitution in thoseProvinces .    It was  conceivable that something might-happen in the interval.    The elements of the Rightmight break away from the elements of the Left in congress;    but this had. been prophesied, before andhad never happened.    In the meanwhile he thought it very important that the Governors of Provinces should maintain contacts with Congress in their respectiveProvinces.    He suggested that, subject to the finaldiscretion of each Governor himself, the Cabinet-should advise them to keep close contacts withmoderate Congress people.&quot;&quot;he Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed with theSecretary of State for India and the First Lord ofthe Admiralty.   He pointed out, however, that it was undesirable to have trouble with Congress and on theNorth-West Frontier simultaneously.    If very firmaction was taken now it might bring trouble on sooner,before the difficulties on the North-West Frontierhad been surmounted.   He agreed with the First Lordthat the present dispute was in the&apos;Provincial sphere
and should be kept in that sphere.The Secretary of State for War referred to theserious reaction which any weakness in handling theinternal situation in India was liable to have onthe Forth-West Frontier.The Secretary of State for India agreed, in theimportance of close contact between the governors and. Congress in the Provinces, notably for the reason that the developments in the situation varied, indifferent parts of India.   He had already suggested to the Viceroy that he should ask the Governors tomaintain such contacts and to take advantage of any opportunity to improve the situation.    He agreed alsothat the present difficulties shoul&quot;&apos;&apos; be kept as faras possible in the Provincial sphere.   He agreed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer that  care mustbe taken to avoid precipitating trouble during thedifficulties on the North-West Frontier.    In makingcontacts it was necessary to avoid, a weak compromise.He proposed to make a statement in the House of lords on the morrow, and he intended to make quite clearthat there was no risk that the Government would, weaken.The Cabinet generally approved thepolicy set forth by the Secretaryof State ^or India&quot; in his memorandum cp.-124 (3 7) and. in his verbal state-ments as summarised above.
THE ARMY.Organisation,Armament and.Equipment of.(previous reference:Cabinet 19(37), Con-clusion 5.)4.   The Cabinet resumed, their discussion on theOrganisation, Armament and Equipment of the Army,which had been adjourned at the Meeting mentioned inthe margin in order that in the interval theChancellor of the Exchequer might discuss with theMinister for Co-ordination of Defence and theSecretary of State for War the extent of theProgramme to which in present  circumstances he could now agree;    and again had before them the following documents:-A Report, by the Chiefs of StaffSub-Committee (CP .-41 (37)):A Memorandum, by the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence fC.P.-46(37)):A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for War I CP.-115 (37)).The Secretary of State for War pointed out thathis proposals had been based on military advicethe rejection of which placed a good deal of responsi-*bility on the Cabinet.   He understood that the criticisms of his proposals were not really directedso much against- their military aspects as against those of man-power an^ finance.    So far as man-power was  concerned, the whole Territorial Army would onlyneed 277,000 men to bring it up to strength on theoutbreak of \var, and 3,000 men a month thereafter.The total Army demand was for 500,000 men, whichhe thought was not excessive.   On the financial sidehe pointer&quot; out that  43,000,000 spread over threeyears did not seera an impossible amount.    If,however, the figure was too high, the best way ofdealing with the matter would be to prolong theperiod of the Programme   beyon^ three years.   He didnot know what   the view of the Foreign Secretary wouldbe on that proposal.   He did not think that a proposal which would only result in 2 Territorial Divisions-10-
being available four months after the outbreak of war,or 4 Divisions six months after    the outbreak,  could,be accepted.   His military advisers thought it veryuns afe .The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said.that, following the Cabinet decision mentioned, in the margin, he had had. an interview with the Chancellorof the Exchequer,  the results .of which he had. passed on to the Secretary of State for Var.    The Chancellorof the&apos; Exchequer had been prepared to agree in substance to the two following proposals in paragraph16 of the Memorandum by the Secretary of State forWar ( C.P .-115 (37)):-&quot;(i) The Regular Army and the two Anti-Air craft Divisions of the TerritorialArmy to be provided, with the mostcomplete and efficient equipment withthe ne e es s ary wa.r res reserve s .   Tot alcost is estimated to be  204,609,000;51the bulk of the programme to be eom-pleted by April, 1940.(ii) The remainder of the Territorial army to receive sufficient equipment ofthe same type as the Regular Army toenable the whole 12 divisions to be trained in peace.    Total  cost estimated to be  9,284,000*   the bulk of theprogramme to be completed, by April,1940&quot; .The Chancellor of the Exchequer had made clear thatin approving the above he made the reservation thatthe items making up the totals marked, with an asteriskwould, be subject to Treasury approval in detail.The Chancellor of the Exchequer had. also pointed outthat the number of Territorial Army divisions that could be equipped for war out of the total of thetraining equipment was shown in Appendix TT to bemore than two Divisions:    for example, in Bren gunsthe numbers were sufficient for six Divisions?    andin several other items for three Divisions. . Never-theless he was prepared, to accept, on the conditions
he had mentioned and subject to the understanding thatthere should be further enquiry before additional expenditure on the Army could be agreed, to.   He himself had  considered how this decision could be fitted, intothe Supply arrangements, and had come to the conclusionthat at any rate it would, have the advantage of enabling the Supply Organisation to proceed on a firm basis.He woul^ have to ask instructions as to what he shouldtell the Supply Organisation.   While he had no alterna-tive but to accept what the Chancellor of the exchequer would, agree to, he emphasised that he regarded theprovision of reserves of material sufficient to enable4 Territorial Divisions to take the field at the endof four months to be a corollary to his earlierproposal.   He felt the force of what the military advisers said, namely, that there was no sense intraining 12 Divisions unless a part of them was to belaterready to so abroad^to replace the 5 Regular Divisions,which by that time would have suffered heavily andwould require relief and re-organisation.    If territory-rial Divisions were to be used for that purpose theymust be supplied, with equipment and reserves of ammuni-tion and war material.    Nevertheless, if the financialstrain of providing such equipment was too great, hewelcomed the decision, which at any rate would givethe Supply Organisation some basis to work upon, andwhen the financial position improved it might bepossible to go further.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that his proposal to try and. reach an agreement on those points which were likely to be generally accepted had beenmade with the object, of avoiding deadlocks between ministers, which were admittedly tiresome to theCabinet,   He had now agreed in principle to accept theproposals of the Secretary of State for -7ar, as already-12-
explained by the Minister for Co-ordination of &quot;Defence,on the understanding that the expenditure involvedwas subject to the usual, process of discussion withthe Treasury in detail.   He understood that theSecretary of State for War wanted a further decisiontoday and was urging the grave responsibility that theCabinet was taking in rejecting the advice of their military advisers.   He could, not accept the question at issue as being a purely military matter.    other considerations entered, into it.   He himself definitelydid  challenge the policy of their military advisers.The country was being asked, to maintain a larger Navythan had. been the  case for very many years:    a greatAir Force., which was a new arm altogether:    and, inaddition, an Army for use on the Continent&quot;,    as wellas facilities for producing munitions which would, berequired not only for our own forces but also for our allies.   He did not believe that we could, or ought,or, in the event, would be allowed, by the country, to with the intention&apos; ofenter a Continental war/ fighting on the same lines asin the last war.   We ought to make up our minds to something different.    Our contribution by land shouldbe on a limited, scale.    It was wrong to assume thatthe next war would be fought by ourselves aloneagainst Germany.    If we had to fight we should haveallies, who must in any event maintain large armies.He did. not accept that we also must send a large army .   He had. said this in order that the cabinet might realise his own point of view, though on this,as on other points, he was, of course, always opento argument.-   His suggestion, therefore, was to appnoveso much of the Secretary of State for War&apos;s proposals as had already been agreed, and to proceed to theconsideration, in comparative leisure, of the properrolg. of the Array in the light of other considerations.
The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence saidthat he had never contemplated an Army on a Continentalscale.   He thought, however, that it was wrong toassume that the decision that was now proposed, couldbe regarded as the limit of what our effort would bein time of war.    (The Chancellor of the Exchequerinterpolated &quot;What we should prepare for&quot;) He wouldbe better satisfied if 2 Divisions were available tobe sent abroad after a period of months.   He agreed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer that the questionof the rSle of the British Army would have to be investigated.The Secretary of State for \tfa.r recalled that thequestion of the role of the British Army was no newone.    It had been under investigation ever since hehad. been a member of the Cabinet, and for six months before.    It was not the War Office demand, that had increased, but its  cost.   He recalled that the originalDefence Requirements Committee had asked for more thanwhat he was now asking, namely, a Regular ExpeditionaryForce of 4 Divisions and 1 Mobile Division,which couldbe reinforced by Territorials at intervals of 4, 6 and months-   That had been the unanimous recommendationof the Committee, which included all three Chiefs ofStaff, and not of the General Staff alone.    If thedecision was now to be postponed, what was proposed?Was the matter to go back to the Chiefs of staff committee for reconsideration, or was a special body to be constituted?   All the planning, including Supply,had been bas-ed on the assumption of an ExpeditionaryForce of 5 Divisions, and. all the Chiefs of Staffagreed, that it was unsafe to send 5 Divisions abroadunless they coul^ be supported within 4 months by 4Territorial Divisions as a minimum.    If no decision was taken on this point the whole question would be
in the air and he could give no instructions to theGeneral Staff.   He might have to instruct the-GeneralStaff to alter all their plans.    Wo alternative proposal had been put forward .   All he claimed wasthat if there was a Territorial Army at all it waswaste of money to maintain it unless it was properlyequipped.    At the  coming Imperial Conference we mightwell he asked by the Pominions whether our territorial force  coul^ go abroad .   What was to be the answer?The idea of equipping the Territorial Army only fortraining was not a military policy .   He could onlyaccept it under protest and because he hoped that thisinterim decision would lead to a permanent decision.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointed,out that as a matter of practical polities it was notpossible at the moment to equip the Territorial army to any extent beyond what the Chancellor of theExchequer novr agreed to.   He would  greatly regret any departure from the previous decision that 5 divisions should be available to go abroad.    Consequently it seemed, to him that the only decision was as to whetherthe Cabinet did or did. not accept the Secretary ofState for -*/ar&apos;s proposal (already quoted above)  inParagraph 16 ( i)  and. (ii), or whether they should, takea new decision in favour of equipping 4 Divisions ofthe Territorial Army.   Was it not possible, he asked,that support for the original s Divisions might bedrawn not from the Territorial Army but by bringinghome Regular troops from India and replacing them byTerritorials?   He thought this question might, befurther explored .tn the  course of the discussion the Secretary ofState for Air, as Chairman of the Mon-Power Committee,which was meeting that afternoon,  consulted the cabinet as to whether, with a view to expediting the further
enquiries  contemplated by the Chancellor of theExchequer, he should give the Committee instructionsto work out the man-power aspects on certain hypotheses.After some further discussion the Cabinet agreed  (a.) As an immediate decision., to accept thefollowing proposals in CP.-115 (37) ,Paragraph 16:-(i) The Regular Army an^ the two Anti-Air craft Divisions of the TerritorialArmy to be provided with the mostcomplete and efficient equipment withthe necessary war reserves,    ^otalcost, is estimated  to be  204,609,000;(the bulk of the programme to be  com-pleted by April, 19407] *(ii) The remainder of the Territorial army to receive sufficient equipment ofthe same type as the Regular Army toenable the whole 12 Divisions to be trained in peace.    Total cost estimated to be  9,284,000*,   [the bulk of theprogramme to be completed by April,19401?*the figures of cost quoted above to besubject to approval by the Treasuryof the&apos; items on which they were based:(b) That  the question of the role of theArmy and its possible further organ-is a. t. ion, armament and equipment, shouldbe referred to the Defence Plans (Policy)Committee, which already has under con-sidera+ion a reference as to a.

5, The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Lord President of the Council &apos; CP.-126 (37))informing his colleagues that the InternationalSugar Conference had reached agreement on theprinciple of a scheme for the regulation of thefree market, and giving for their confidential information some particulars of the position.The Lord President attached to his Memorandum a.Report of the Negotiating Committee, which theConference had agreed should serve as a basis forthe drafting of a definite agreement.   He was hopeful that an agreement might be concluded and signedabout the middle of next week.The Lord President of the Council, as chairman of the International Sugar Conference, saidthat, as a result of the meeting of the Conference onthe previous day, he wanted instructions as towhether the British representatives should .sign the International Agreement.     He recalled that His Majesty*s Government had gone into thismatter because they could hardly avoid it, but without any sanguine prospects of success.      TheDutch Prime Minister, on whom he relied to co-operate,had been unable to render assistance as he wasfighting an election.     At the moment, the position was that the Yugo-Slav delegates had referred totheir Government for instructions, but expected a reply to-day.     Canada, whose only official requestshad been embodied in the Agreement, had startled theConference on the previous day by refusing to sign,but, in making his declaration, the Canadian HighCommissioner had announced that Canada accepted the
particular points desired       Canada on which he had agreed at earlier meetings.     The remaining dominions were in agreement and would sign.      The position of Chinaand Brazil was uncertain as they had not been represented at the meeting on the previous day.     AHother Delegations had agreed to sign.     The Frenchdelegates had taken up the curious position that theywould not sign unless one of the authentic signed copieswas in the French language.     He himself had announcedthat the document was to be in the English language.     TheGermans had supportod him and had declared that if theFrench language was insisted on they would have to insist on the German language.     The Russianrepresentative had intimated that in that event he would demand a fourth official language, and there had beensymptoms of a similar attitude on the part of other delegations.Commenting on the Convention, the lord president said the United Kingdom Delegation had beonvery careful to protect the interests of consumers anda clause to this effect was included.     The interests of consumers were also covered by a wider power, namely, thatif it was found that the Agreement was not being administered properly, it could be denounced,       a difficult Question had been that of the distribution of voting powers on the. permanent organisation.     Eventually,-they had agreed that the producers should have 55 votesand consumers (which included the United Kingdom and canada) 45 Votes.     The threatened withdrawal of Canadahad been troublesome, because the Canadian 5 votes werein the consumers block.     It had been agreed that ifCanada Withdrew,  the 5 votes should be distributed amongthe other consumer powers.
The Secretary of State for the Colonies &apos;considered the Agreement a good one both from theBritish and Colonial point of view.     He emphasised the seriousness of the defection of Canada more particularly from the point of view of the Colonies, who attached theutmost importance to Canada&apos;s adherence,     A Canadianwithdrawal would also increase the difficulties in defending the Agreement in Parliament.      He hoped,therefore, that the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs would do his utmost to persuade the GanadianGovernment to sign.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs agreed&apos;to try and do this.     The decision had been quiteunexpected, hut the fact was that Canada had a Liberal-Government which disliked any Agreement not based onfree trade.Warm congratulations were offered to the lord president of the Council on the success of his efforts.The Cabinet agreed:(a) That the British Delegates at theInternational Sugar Conference shouldbe authorised to sign the Agreement that had been concluded:(b) That the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs should do his utmost to induce the Canadian Government to authorisethe Canadian Delegates to sign.
If?6,   The Cabinet had before them the Fourth Reportof the Cabinet Committee on the Organisation of theCoal Mining Industry (CP.-128 (37)),  covering adraft Coal Bill.   At the end of their Report theCommittee summarised their Conclusions and Recommend&apos;ations as followsJ-(i) It is a physical impossibility, owingto the very limited amount of Parlia-mentary time available according topresent plans, to pass into law beforethe summer recess a combined Billcovering the three fields of coal policywhich require legislation, viz., unification-tion of royalties, compulsory amalgama-tions and the continuation with amendments of Part I of the Coal Mines Act, 1930,(ii) There are difficulties, from the Parlia-mentary point of view, in introducing, a combined Bill, making as much progress with it as is possible before the holidays, and completing the remaining stages after a summer adjournment;    andnothing will be gained by introducing a Bill dealing with part of the fieldonly.(iii) Our recommendation is that a combinedBill be carried through all its stages,as the first legislative measure of the1937-38 Session;    the Session should be begun early enough to allow of this Billbecoming law by Christmas next.(iv) Should the. Bill, owing to some unforeseencontingency, not have received, the royal assent by Christmas next, it will benecessary to pass a short ad hoc measurecontinuing in force for s. few additionalweeks Part I of the 193 0 Act..(v) Subject to a few drafting points, withwhich the Cabinet need, not be troubled,we recommend that the Bill, to be intro-duced at the beginning of the 1937-38Session should be in the form of thedraft attached, to the present Report.At the conclusion of a statement on therecommendations of the Cabinet Commit tee,in thecourse of which he had drawn attention to the veryserious risks involved in the postponement oflegislation, the President of the Board of trade said that shortly before the meeting he had been
informed of a proposal by the Treasury for dealingwith the situation.      Their proposal was based on theidea that a short and less controversial Bill whichcould be passed this Session could be devised whichwould cover the Government against one of the risks of postponement, namely, a dragging out of the assessmentprocess and general delay until the award had lost itsrelevance and to enable the distribution of the moneyto be made earlier.     Such a Bill would cover the first step of the acquisition without asking Parliament to commit themselves to more than the making of a register of the interests in respect of which the compensation was to be distributed.     He had not yet had time to study this proposal.The Cabinet agreed:That the proposal of the Treasury shouldbe referred back to the CabinetCommittee on the Organisation of theCoal Mining Industry and that, in themeantime, a decision on their fouth report should be postponed.
