1.   The Prime Minister said that, as this was thefirst Meeting of the Cabinet since the reconstruction of the Government, he would like to say how glad, hewas to meet his  colleagues, and. expressed the hopethat they would he a happy family and do good. work.He welcomed, the Lord Privy Seal and Minister ofTransport as new colleagues. &apos; He mentioned, also thatthe Secretary of State for the Colonies was in theChamber of the House of Commons and could not bepres ent.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, on behalf of hiscolleagues, expressed their wel co%e to the new PrimeMinister.The Prime Minister read, the following extractfrom a. letter he had. received, from the late lord president of the Council:-&quot;One personal matter I regret T- and perhaps you would, be good enough toassist me in dealing with it.   At every&apos; last meeting&apos;  of a Cabinet I have attended, it was made known thai therewould, be a doxology which would close the companionship&quot;.   Last Wednesday I was .informed, that I would, be safe if I fixed,an urgent deputation at 5 p.m.   before i left I asked if there was any other business for which I should wait and was told that I might quite properly leave,and. I did so.    Just before I left my roomin the House at 7 o&apos; clock, I was told thatthe Cabinet closed in the usual friendlyway and. that my name was mentioned.    I wasvery sorry that I was not present to thankcolleagues over whom I had presided,and with whom I had subsequently sat asa member of the team, as I wished, to do.I have only just read the minutes of that last meeting, and I regrEt with all myheart that T was not present to expressto my colleagues the gratitude I owe tothem   especially during those earlier years of the National Government whenpersonal friendship and. co-operation was the bond which enabled us to keeptogether and. produce the beneficial results to the nation which I believe will mark forall time the fine achievements of our national combination.   Though the cabinet is now a new one, the members have all been in the old. team, and I would havehad them all in mind, in anything I might
have said on Wednesday.    I wonder ifyou would he so good at. your next meeting as to tell the members of mygratitude for their loyal  co-operation and. my regrets that I am no longerable to share their work.&quot;
2. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs made a report to the Cabinet on the recent meetingsof the Council and Assembly of the League of nations at Geneva.   The meetings had not proved so unsatis-factory as at one time seemed possible.The Franco-Turkish dispute over the Sanjak hadbeen cleared up so far as Geneva was  concerned, and,subject to adjustments to be made later, should not create difficulties.   The dangers of a conflict hadbeen removed.   Both the French and Turkish Governmentwere satisfied.    Without the co-operation of Britishand Indian expert advisers it was doubtful if asettlement would have been reached.So far as Spain was concerned, the discussions had been satisfactory.   The Resolution passed, hadreaffirmed the principle of non-intervention andwoulr1 be useful in Pa.rlia.ment.    No member had suggested any policy except non-intervention. (see also Conclusion 5 below.).It had not been found possible to raise thequestion of the representation of Abyssinia.   NoAbyssinian representative had attended, the meeting and consequently the Credentials Committee had hadno ground to deal with the matter.    If an Abyssinianrepresentative had been there the result might havebeen different.   The French Government, whom heconsulted first in Paris and afterwards in Geneva,had not been prepared to have the question raised.The Soviet representative had also been opposed toits being raised.    At the last moment the Polishrepresentative had made an effort to raise the
question.    Only the shortest notice had been&apos; received.The French Foreign Minister, whom the foreign secretary had  consulted, had declined to follow thePolish lead.    The Foreign Secretary had then had ahasty consultation with representatives of theDominions, who were all opposed to supporting thePolish initiative.    Even countries like Switzerland,Austria, and. Hungary, which had. not co-operated insanctions, had not been willing to support the Polishrepresentative.    If the United Kingdom Delegation had done so they would, not have had the support of theDominions.    The question was now relegated, to the september Meeting of the Assembly.    Only a strongBritish lead could have achieved a result.The Prime Minister regretted that the proceedingshad. taken that turn, but. agreed, that in the circum-stances the Foreign Secretary had. had no alternative but to take the course he did.The general The Foreign Secretary reported that he had foundInt international iona. 1Situation. the general international atmosphere rather lesstense   but see following Conclusion.
3.   The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that since his return the international- situa-tion had received, a setback owing to the bombing ofthe German &quot;pocket-battleship&quot; DEUTSCHLAND.     Inparticular, this had. upset the plan for the withdrawalof volunteers from Spain and had made a gap in theseherne of non-intervention.    He was apprehensivelest the Italians might use the opportunity to destroy the non-intervention scheme. ^ Two J&amp;Qliaia&quot;observers who had embarked, at Genoa^/had. been sentback.   He-was trying to get assurances that Italianco-operation with observers should, continue, and.was also approaching the German Government on thesubject.    The Portuguese Government had. been subjected, to pressure by the Italians to withdraw from the non-intervention scheme, but had. resisted.He had been doing his best to hold the position by pressure on the Italian and German Governments tocontinue the policy of non-intervention except, forthe moment, so far as a.ct.ive naval  co-operation was concerned.   He had considerable apprehension as towhether the scheme could be maintained.   His aim wasto get into direct communication with Berlin, andwith the Prime Minister&apos;s approval he had taken steps to make an approach to the German Governmentwith a view to maintaining, their co-operation in spain.    In reply to a question, he said, that what he had in mind ?/as not a visit by a British repre-sentative to. Berlin, but by a German representative to London.   His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Berlinhad asked whether this meant that he was to try and/induce Baron von Neurath to abandon his visit to countries in South-Eastern Europe,but he had repliedthat he was not pressing him to cancel the visitbut hoped, that on his return he might be able tocome to London.
4. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs  (CP.-149 (37))on the question of the desire of the Royal Commissionon Palestine to quote in their Report extra.cts fromthe MeMahon-Hussein Correspondence of 1915 and. 1916,which dealt, inter alia, with the territory in whichthe independence of the Arabs was to be recognisedshould the Ottoman Empire suffer defeat in the War,Violent  controversy had since raged at various timesover the exact interpretation of the pledge given bySir Henry- MeMahon to King Hussein about this territory.Tn their evidence before the Royal Commission the Arabslaid the strongest emphasis upon this  correspondence,which, according to their interpretation, was totallyat variance with the later Balfour Decla.ra.tion and theMandate for Palestine.    The Commission had. no intentionof pronouncing upon the proper interpretation of the pledge, but they wished to place the interpretationgiven by His Majesty&apos;s Government in as favourable alight as possible, by quoting from the correspondencerather than confining themselves to generalities.Since the publication of the correspondence wouldnot furnish those whose interpretation of the pledgediffered  from that of His Majesty&apos;s Government withany information they did not already possess, and.since the effects on Indian Moslem opinion wereproblematical, the Secretary of State suggested that.His Majesty&apos;s Government should, agree- to the publioa-tion in the Report of the Royal Commission of anyextracts from the correspondence that the commission might desire, and should decide to accede withoutdelay to any subsequent demand which might be madefor full official publication.
The Prime Minister read a note from the Secretaryof State for the Colonies toi the effect that he supported the view of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs and thought it was high time that amore authoritative statement than had yet been published should be made on this matter, which wasthe basis of the Arab claim.The Secretary of State for India said thathitherto the Government of India had been opposedto publication of the Kitchener-Abdullah correspond-ence.   Their reason was that if the extracts whichthe Royal Commission desired to include in theirReport were published, it would be difficult to resist the subsequent publication of the whole ofthe correspondence, including the passages relatingto the Caliphate and the suggestion made by HisMajesty&apos;s Government t-&quot;*- King Hussein that he mightassume the Caliphate in place of the Ottoman Sultanemhe fact that such a suggestion had been made might lead, to attacks on the part of Indian Moslems on theground that       for our selfish interests we had.interfered, in a religious matter.   He had thereforediscreetly consulted certain Moslem friends who werein London for the Coronation, without giving themparticulars.   His friends had. not. thought that any considerable difficulties would be raised, though they considered, that undoubted-li^ use would be madeof this publication by those who were prepared touse any pretext to attack His Majesty&apos;s Government.He had. then put to them that from the point of viewof Imperial policy there might be strong advantages in publication, and they, had agreed that theobjections were not sufficiently great to justify a refusal,
The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointedout that the proposal to substitute the guardian ofMecca a.s Caliph for an infidel did not appear a very-heinous mistake.The Secretary of State for India agreed, and pointed out that the circumstances had changed a gooddeal since the date of the  correspondence.The Cabinet agreed.  That the Secretary of State for theColonies should be authorised to agreeto the publication in the Report ofthe Royal Commission of any extracts from the correspondence that the RoyalCommission on Palestine might desire,and should accede without delay to any subsequent demand which might be madefor full official publication.
PALESTINE. 5. The Cabinet, took note of a. Memorandum by theSituation in. Secretary of State ^or the Colonies (CP.-144 (37))circulating for the information of his  colleagues(previous reference: the latest letter from the High Commissioner, in cabinet 21(37), Con- which he described the present situation in Palestineelusion 4.)
AVIATION.rasn Pene-tion inNea.r a.ndEast.^ral Policy.eferen ce:cabinet 4?,*56) , Con-lus ion 6 .)6.     The Cabinet- had before them a Note by theSecretary of State for Air ( C.P.-14S (37))   cireulat-inp for the information of his  colleagues a. Memoran-dum on the subject of German penetration in civilaviation in the Near ant? Far East, which had beensubmitted to him by the Inter-Departmental Committeeon International Air Communications.    The Secretaryii*[hj)z Qf state proposed to circulate the Memorandum alsoto the Committee of Imperial Defence, and suggestedthat  copies should be transmitted to the Dominionsand Colonies  concerned, and. to the Government ofIndia.    The Memorandum briefly indicated, the progressGermany was making in Greece, Egypt, Iraq, Persia,Afghanistan and. China, and. suggested, that the Germanefforts in each of these countries should, be regardedas part of one whole plan directed towardsexpansion of German influence and. commerce in theNear and Far East.The Secretary of State for Air said thathis memorandum dealt with German activities, but he wished to make some remarks on the general policygoverning civil aviation,.     The policy which HisMajestyrs Government in the United Kingdoms/had aimed at at the International Conference on Civil Aviation,some years ago was one of complete freedom in the air,that is to say that airports should be as free for civil aviation as commercial ports were for. the mercantilemarine.     We had failed to secure that policy at theInternational Conference.     The result had been thatwe had been driven into a policy of reciprocalconcessions.     Every case had had to be the subjectof a bargain,     Fortunately, we had hitherto not been
badly situated for such a policy and had generallybeen able to obtain a useful quid pro quo for any concessions made.     The subject had recently beenconsidered &quot;by the Civil Air Communications Committeeof the Imperial Conference.     He was glad to be ableto say that the resolution adopted had been in favourof the Governments of the Empire always playing asa combined team.     He had hardly hoped for so good aresult.     All the Delegations concerned had been represented by Ministers except South Africa, but hethought there was every prospect of securing acceptanceof the resolution by the Imperial Conference,     Hisown view was that it was just as impossible to keepthe air Powers out of world civil aviation as it waato stop the development of mercantile services in world shipping.     He thought it was impossible to do more than to use our Empire geographical positionto ensure the fullest reciprocity and the best bargainin each casee     That policy must be subject to threeconditions -(a) We must avoid cut-throat competition andthe establishment of uneconomic services.This, for example, had justified our attitude towards the development ofGerman air services to Egypt and the pressure we had put on the Australian      2*Government to refuse permission for theestablishment of a Dutch air service toAustralia:(b) We ought to try and stop the developmentof a foreign air route if it would adversely affect some important strategicinterest:(c) We were quite right to try and maintainBritish control of our interest in important aviation companies - for example,in Egypt, but this was a different matterfrom refusing landing rights to foreignconcerns^  We had to bear in mind two
important considerations -(i)   We ourselves were vitallydependent on foreign facilities.For example, landing rights in french and Italian territorywere essential to the Empire air route and facilities in germany were equally essential to the scandinavian route.      Consequently,we could not carry our oppositionto foreign services up to the pointof courting a refusal of facilitiesindispensable to ourselves:(ii)   Germany was already using the double argument:    first, thatrefusal of their facilities waspart of a policy of encirclement,and second, that if Germany hadcolonies she would have her ownports of call and her ownbargaining counters to use inobtaining reciprocal facilitieselsewhere 0     This would be trueboth of Tanganyika and the FrenchOameroons If they were returnedto Germany,These latter factors had not been raised at theJS^msrti^heo.. o* .,,tihe-. ,(3a&amp; &amp;^TticG&amp;*     but the Cabinet were bound to take them into consideration.The Home Secretary supported the view of theSecretary of State for Air.     In the past we had beenright to adopt an exclusive policy for the reason thatthe question of national prestige had been involved inthe development of British air communications.     Thesituation was now charged and he thought that the policyof air development should be the same as in the case ofthe mercantile marine.     It appeared that the ItalianGovernment were tending to push us out rather than for.us to restrict the air services of other foreigncountries.      On balance, he felt that it was right todeal rather generously with the German Government inthis matter with a view to removing their suspicions.The Secretary of State for Air agreed that in italy we were particularly vulnerable.     He had, however,
just received a very satisfactory offer from theItalian Government for the use for seven years of LakeBracciano which was the only suitable place for use byseaplanes.     The Italians only asked as a quid pro quofor customs facilities in Khartum^     He was- in communication with the Foreign Secretary on the matter.The Foreign Secretary said that the Sudanauthorities were strongly opposed to making this concession to Italy and they were backed by HisMajesty*s Ambassador in Egypt,     He was not preparedto give an answer at the moment.The Secretary of State for Air said that theonly alternative place for seaplanes to alight was atNaples where the facilities were dangerous for thispurpose by day and unuseable by night.     He suggestedthat the opportunities for intrigue against usafforded by customs facilities were small esjjeuiallywhen it was remembered that the Italians already hadthe right to land at Khartum,     If he could not adjust,the matter with the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, he would have to bring it to the Oabinet,   *jThe Secretary of State for Dominion affairs said that it would be a serious matter if the Empireair services were rendered impracticable.The Secretary of State for Air assured theOabinet that it was ^-pbyRj-rifli i^pngRipjO-j^y to carry through the Empire air route without the use of italian territory.      This was true not only f orseaplanes but also for aeroplanes, for which it would benecessary to use an Italian landing ground at Tobruk.Unless the proposal for Lake Bracciano could beaccepted, the Empire air mail route could not becarried on by night,
The Secretary of State for India said he did not wish to dissent from the proposal of theSecretary of State for Air hut he felt bound to mention certain points of difficulty from the pointof view of the Government of India,     The proposedGerman routes to Iraq., Iran and Afghanistan with possible extension to china were not very acceptable to the Government of Afghanistan.     When thatGovernment had been approached by the Germans theyhad replied that they would give an answer afterconsent had been given by the Governments of Iraq, andIran.     They had hoped that we should take action at baghdad to stop the consent of the Government of Iraq.-Be^fehr Governments, however, had now given their consent and the Afghaniask&amp;s Governments-was confronted with a difficult decision..     There was yet anotherprobable difficulty.     The Prime Minister of afghanistan thought that if the German route weresanctioned, the Soviet Government would try and establish an air route from Tashkent to -Eahul which the afghans would dislike.     This would involve theopening up of an air route jfrqm India to Kabul&apos; and^-;ki^adt3dftion^^ai^ ro^ute&quot; whi-International vGonven-tion-.     These were points whichwould require consideration.     He asked how soon theGerman scheme was likely to come into operation.The Secretary of State for Air said that theGermans had a good many machines which were half civil and half military and should be able to bring their scheme into existence rapidly.     He called attentionto his suggestion that the point raised by theSecretary of State for India should be considered bythe Committee of Imperial Defence.- 14 -
The Secretary of State for India agreed.The Home Secretary suggested that if theGermans did obtain permission to establish an air route, we ought to take up at once the Question of theIndian-Kabul air route6     Perhaps, we might, with advantage, have done this earlier.The Cabinet agreed:(a) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should give his personal attention to the requestof the Secretary of State for Airthat customs facilities should begiven to Italian aircraft atKhartum in return for the use of lake Bracclano by seaplanes forthe Empire air route:(b) That the memorandum by theSecretary of State for Air on german Penetration in the Hear and far East (OoP. 145 (37)), togetherwith the above summary of theCabinet discussion, should bereferred to the Committee ofImperial Defence for consideration and reports
LAW REFORM.(previous reference:Cabinet 31(555),  Con-clusion 6.)F.B.^^7J 12STATE-OWNEDSHIPS.Immunity of.(previous reference:Cabinet 9(37)&apos;Con-clusion 8)7,   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Lord Chancellor (CP.-146 (37))  seeking authorityfor the drafting of an omnibus Administration ofJustice Bill to amend, the Supreme Court of Judicature(Consolidation) Act, 1925, the Criminal Justice Act,1925, and. the County Courts Act, 1934, in accordancewith the recommendations of the Royal Commission onthe Despatch of Business at Common Law (1936 Cmd.5065);and of a Law Reform Bill, in order to carry out therecommendations  contained in the Fifth and SixthInterim Reports of the Law Revision Committee (1936Cmd .5334 and 1937 Cmd .5449).    Both Bills should beready for introduction at. the beginning of next session at latest.The Lord Chancellor explained that the onlydecision he was asking for was authority for thepreparation of a Bill.      There were many contentiouspoints which he himself must consider in the firstinstance;    $n some of them he might have to consult the Cabinet.The President of the Board of Trade recalledConventionthat the Cabinet had approved an International /on the Immunity of State-owned Ships which requiredlegislation.      He thought It possible that this might be dealt with in the Lord Chancellor&apos;s Bill.The Lord Chancellor said he had no objection to considering the inclusion of a olause.The Cabinet agreed:(a) that the Lord Chancellor should beauthorised to draft a Bill inaccordance with the proposal containedin CP.-146 (37).
(b) that the President of the Board ofTrade should communicate with theLord Chancellor with a view to thepossible inclusion in the Bill ofa     clause dealing with the international convention on the Immunity of State-owned Ships.
MINISTERS&apos; OFTHE CROWNBILL.remuneration of the LawOfficers.(previous reference:Cabinet 19(37), Con-elusion 6. )MEMBERS *SALARIES.(previous reference:Cabinet 22(37), Con-clusion 6.)8.      The Chancellor of the Exchequer said thatthe Ministers&apos;  of the Crown Bill had now passed through the Committee stage.      A few firesh points were likely to he raised on the Report stage of theBill.The Prime Minister hoped that as theChancellor ef the Exchequer, as Home Secretary, hadtaken charge of the Bill in the House of Commons,he should continue to do so with the assistance ofthe Minister of Health.The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed.He said that the question had been raised of an amendment to Clause 3 of the Bill.      It had beensuggested that some provision ought to be made toavoid the possibility of bringing into the cabinet ministers now outside whose salareis were lowerv/ith a view to bringing their salaries up to 5,000 a year.     He himself thought that noPrime Minister would resort to this expedient, buthe had suggested an amendment which the opposition would accept,     A discussion had been raised inthe Committee stage of the Bill as to the remuneration of the Law Officers.      The Minister ofHealth had undertaken that the Government wouldtake what had been said in Committee into consider-ation.     The question, therefore, might be raised on the Report stage, though as yet no amendmenthad been tabled.     He himself did not think it wasnecessary for the Government to make any proposal.The Minister of Health agreed.
The Prime Minister thought that if the matter were raised it might he necessary for the Government,after further consideration, to confirm their formerdecision.      He asked if the criticism was that the LawOfficers would receive more than other Ministers or that they were ever-paid.The Minister of ^ealth said that the view ofMr. Lloyd G-eorge and seme other Members was that theLaw Officers ought to receive fixed salaries.      If this were proposed there would be long discussions on theBill.      If, however,  it was said that the Governmentwere still considering the matter he thought theHouse of Commons would accept that statement.The Lord Chancellor demurred to any such statement as it would only mean that the matter wouldbe raised later.The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested thathe should take the line that the Government did notconsider that a new clause was called for in thepresent Bill, which did not deal with the case of theLaw Officers.      He would point out that the salariesofithe Law Officers had been reduced by  2,000 a year on the recommendation of two Committees of the Houseof CommonsoThe Cabinet agreed:(a) to approve the last suggestion ofthe Chancellor of the Exchequer.(b) that the Chancellor of the Exchequer,who as Home Secretary had takencharge of the Bill on behalf ofthe Government, should continue todo so with the assistance of theMinister of Health.
that in reply to a question to beaddressed to him in Parliament onthe following day, he should statet ha t;the-4fenist-e re ? e4L^he--G-r-e-wn-Bili&apos; should not be the subject of a free vote in the House ef Commons.-SO-
RATING ANDVALUATIONBILL.(previous reference:Cabinet  58(36) , Con-elusion 9 &amp;Appendix.)f:R.^n-^)ia.9.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Health (CP.-147 (37))  asking authorityfor the preparation of a short Bill to continue fora further quinquennium outside London the existingscales of deduction from gross values in calculatingrateable values?    otherwise the temporary provisionscontained, in the Rating and Valuation Act, 1932, wouldlapse in some areas on April 1, 1938, when newvaluation lists were due to come into force, with aresultant general increase in the rate burden on theoccupants of working-class houses.The Cabinet agreed:To approve the proposals of theMinister of Health as set forth in cp.-147 (37) and summarised above.
2 o 5IMPERIALCONFERENCE,  1937.(previous reference:Cabinet 12(37), Con-elusion 4).10.    The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs said, that d-iscussion was proceeding atthe Imperial Conference on a large number cftopics^      He hoped that the final meeting wouldtake place on June 15th.      He had a Paper in preparation for the information of the Cabinet,but he thought it would be more useful if hereserved it for the next weekly meeting of theCabinet when he would be in a position to makea more comprehensive report,.      His presentimpressions were that the discussions wereproving extremely useful^      Though one delgation had rather strong views of its own there wereprospects of a large measure of agreement.He recalled that the Secretary cf State for Airhad already mentioned agreed conclusions, andother subjects were proceeding in a very favourable manner.The Prime Minister confirmed the impressionsof the Secretary cf State for Dominion Affairs.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I.,2nd June,  1937.
