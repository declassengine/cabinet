THE SITUATIONIN SPAIN.(Previousbombing of the DEUTSCHDAND were in process of beingReference:Cabinet 23(37), Con-clusions 2and 3.)German and Italian Governments had addressed a Note tothe Spanish Government and the Spanish Insurgentsasking for certain assurances.    If these were receivedcleared up.    After discussions, the British, French,the German and Italian Governments would return tocollaboration in carrying out the non-interventionscheme.   When the matter had been discussed on theprevious Saturday he had tried to get the German andIt al i an/IJfl*Ea.&quot;Qo ^b-a-ete-a^fetii-op eTat^jwr*a*te-^a^eo.   TheItalians had been rather forthcoming on the subject,but.the Germans less so.    That very morning he hadreceived a letter from Count Grandi saying that theItalian/Uesfy would resume co-operation at once and thathe had every hope that the same afternoon a joint letter\vould be sent to the Chairman of the Non-intervention committee by the German and Ita.lia.n Ambassadorsundertaking to return to co-operation.   The french proposals for combining the Fleets of the four Powerscarrying out non-intervention had been rejected.The Secretary of State then asked for favourable consideration to the suggestion for attaching neutralobservers to the worships engaged in carrying out thenon-intervention scheme.   The Italians were willing toconsider it, but the Germans were less favourable.It would have the advantage of increasing confidence inthe scheme, and might be useful in the event of a repetition of an incident like the bombing of theDEUTS CHLAND.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he wouldnot oppose the examination of the project, but therewere grave objections to it.   Moreover, in the view of-1-.
9 9the Admiralty it. was not likely to be of much practicalvalue.   Special arrangements would he required to avoidneutral observers penetrating into the more secret partsof a ship.   Although, as the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs had suggested, it might give confidence to the Spanish Government and the Insurgents that shipsengaged on non-intervention would not be used forbombardment purposes or for sinking their vessels, ithad to be remembered, that the Powers concerned. ha.d other ships in Spanish waters besides those being used fornon-intervention, and. if they had any sinister designsthe former ships would be used.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said that from a study of reports on non-intervention he got theimpression that arms and munitions and aircraft wereflowing into Spain in spite of the non-interventionscheme.   He had an idea that more was going in from &apos;Italy than fr-om Russia.The Secretary of State for War confirmed that thelatest intelligence indicated, that Signor Mussolini wasallowing a good deal of material to go to Spain.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said, thatApril had. been a bad. month, but May had. been somewhatbetter.   Undoubtedly there were considerable leaks.At one time some of his advisers in the Foreign office had doubted whether it was worth going on with the schemebut he had. reached, the view that the state of affairs would be worse if the scheme were dropped,   -^he -hardestgap in the scheme to close was the flight of aeroplanesfrom Italy to Majorca and Spain.In reply to a question he said that he had,seen no reply from General Franco to our Note protesting againstthe laying of submarine mines in the open sea.
The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should discuss with the First^&quot;Lord of the Admiralty the question ofattaching neutral observers to men-of-warengaged in the non-intervention scheme:(b) That, notwithstanding the failure of thenon-intervention scheme to prevent the flow of war material of various kinds to spain, the situation would, certainly be worse if the scheme were dropped.-3-
inGERMANY.(previous reference:Cabinet 23(37), Con-el usr ion2. &quot;Tie Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat the visit of Earon von Neurath, the German ForeignMinister, ought to he useful.    He had informed theFrench Government and had heard that morning thatM. Delbos was not unduly perturbed.    The proposal had originally arisen out of the bombing of the DEUTSCHLAND,and consequently Spain had been mentioned among the subjects to be discussed.   Baron von Neurath had firstrefused to have Spain mentioned publicly, but eventuallyhad agreed.   His refusal had perhaps been a result ofthe     Berlin - Rome&quot;axis&quot; and out of deference to Italy.Baron von Neurath*s reversal of attitude, however, andhis consent to the inclusion of Spain among the subjects to be discussed were perhaps  connected with the moreforthcoming attitude of the Italians in regard to thenon-intervention scheme within the last few days.-4-
973CHINA. g. rp^g Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the;tra-T.erritQ.rt- secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (C.P.-153 (37))xty in.stating that the United. States Government requested.Prevxous the views and. observations of His Majesty&apos;s government reference: d95&quot;!?fne!, 92 on the question of the resumption of negotiations for(31), Con- M Belusion 3 .)the abolition of extra-territoriality in China.   TheUnited. States Government were in favour of resumption,and enquired whether His Majesty&apos;s Government thought-it would be better for the foreign Governments to takethe initiative in approaching the Chinese Government,or to await proposals from China.   An interim reply hadbeen sent to the United States Embassy favouring thelatter course pending a decision on the important pointso^ policy involved.    The Secretary of State suggestedthat, negotiations should be begun on the basis of adraft Treaty drawn up in June, 1931, since when thewhole question of extra-territoriality had remained in abeyance.    The greatest difficulty arose out of the peculiar position of the International Settlement at shangai and the neighbouring areas, which were excluded,from the operation of the draft Treaty, and. the Secretaryof State suggested, that it would be best to insist now,as in 1931, on complete exclusion, in order to affordtime for further negotiations.    It seemed desirable,also, in view of the present conciliatory attitude ofthe Japanese, to propose to them to adopt the same- attitude as ourselves and. the United States over thequestion of extra-territoriality   a point on whichHis Majesty&apos;s Amba.ssa.dors at Peking a.nA Tokyo werebeing consulted.After the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs had made a statement on the lines of his memorandum the Lord Chancellor recalled that in 1930 he had paid a visit to China.   There was no doubt that politically-minded Chinese desired the abolition of extra-
territorially, but. the Europeans were apprehensive.He had visited Tientsin, where the German and RussianSettlements had already been handed back to the Chinese and presented a. very unfavourable contrast with the adjoining British Settlement *   In Shanghai the leadingBritish inhabitants had been horrified at. the idea ofhanding the International Settlement over to theChinese.   Although the Chinese Legal Code was admirableit was not honestly administered by the Chinese Judges,of which he gave examples.   He hoped, therefore, thatthe Foreign Office v/ould  consult the leading firms inChina, and- the Shanghai Municipality, before making achange which he believed v:-ould be disastrous to our trade and. embarrassing to the Chinese themselves, whopreferred the sa.fety o^ Shanghai to the precariousconditions outside.In the course of the discussion it was shown thatthe Government of India, the -Var Office a.nd the Boardof Tra.de had. special interests in this question andwould, wish to be informed of the progress of negotia.-tions and  consulted on their own aspects.The Chancellor of ^he Exchequer communicated tothe Cabinet the views obtained in writing fromSir Frederick Leith-Ross. who thought that the ForeignOffice Memorandum tended to pa.int the Chinese adminis-tration in too favourable a. light:.   He himself agreed.He and Sir Frederick Leith-Ross both thought it inevitable, in the long run, that we should have to give up extra-territorial rights as in Egypt, but that weshould walk very warily.    It. was the Japanese who were likely to get a. foot in where our position was weakened.It had to be remembered that, in 1933 our position inthe International Settlement had h^d a good deal to do with getting the Japanese out of China.    It also had.to be remembered that the main economic need of China
was the investment of foreign capital in China.., and that, was not to be secured by the abolition of extra-t. errit oriality, which would reduce the confid.ence offoreign investors.    Sir Frederick Leith-Ross had.suggested to him that the Chinese found the collectionof income-tax in the International Settlement verydifficult, since some foreign tax-payers used, theirextra-territorial rights for the purpose of evadingincome-tax.    Sir Frederick thought it possible that if that difficulty coul^ be surmounted it would go far toChancellor&apos;shelp the Chinese.  The/ own attitude was that sooner or later we should, have to abandon extra-territorial rights,hut that it was largely a matter of time and method.In any event he could not agree to a time-limit, whichwas really only another method of giving way.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, whohad also travelled in China, in 1929-30, agreed generally with the opinions that had already been expressed as tothe views of British residents in China, which were not likely to have changed .   He agreed, also that Shanghaimust be excluded from the scheme.    Vhile we should, not take the initiative in raising the matter with theChinese, he thought that  if the Chinese took it up we, should avoid becoming the spearhead, of a resistance.Tn that event &quot;e should not be too rigid, but should makethe best bargain we could.The Prime Minister pointed, out that the presentposition was that we were being approached, not by theChinese *ut by the United States of America.    The choiceappeared, to be whether we should, wait or take the initla-tive in the matter.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed with most of the remarks of his colleagues.   He hadgathered from the Foreign Office that, morning that theChinese were not pressing the matter at the moment.
-8-He did not wish to take any initiative.    If the UnitedStates of America asked for our view he would reply thatwe would prefer to wait until the Chinese raised thequestion*    He did not propose to go into details withthe United States of America, hut if they raised thematter he would reply on the lines indicated, in his memorandum.   For exa.mple, if the question of Shanghaiwere raised he would state that we should prefer to haveShanghai excluded from any extra-territoriality negotia-tions.   He was advised by His Majesty&apos;?. Ambassadors in tokyo and Peking that it. would he better not to raisethe question with the Japanese Government unless theChinese Government brought it up.The Prime Minister said that the line proposed bythe Foreign Secretary was in accord with the views expressed at the Meeting.

He was now contiuinghis mission, and his next voyage would be from Brusselsto Paris, Warsaw, Prague, and back to Brussels.
&amp; i 0THE IMPERIAL 5. The Secretary of State for Dominion AffairsCONFERENCE.recalled that the Cabinet had been kept informed of what(Previous        was happening at the Imperial Conference by the eircula-reference:Cabinet 23     tion of the Minutes of the Meetings of the Principal(37),  Con-clusion 10.) Delegates.   He would, propose, however,  to supplementpr.2jlyj)these by a few reme.rks on the general results.First, he mentioned, that certain conclusions had.been reached which had not been published, on suchmatters as Munitions, Civil Aviation, and Empire Trade.He proposed, after consult ation with the other ministers concerned, to circulate a Memorandum on these aspects.There had been a difference between the recent conference and its predecessors.   Since 1926 theImperial Conferences had been mainly concerned withConstitutional Relations, and the tendency had been to lay the main stress on the nationhood of the Dominions,which had perhaps encouraged an impression abroad ofsome growing disunity in the British Commonwealth ofNations.    The United Kingdom Delegation had entered, thepresent Conference with the idea of re-establishing thebalance, not by minimising in any way the freedom, of thenations, of the Commonwealth, but. by bringing into greaterprominence the aspect of co-operation.    En this they hadbeen successful, and. the general result of the conference had been to re-assert somewhat the principle of co-operation,    &quot;his was important, because he hoped thatthis was the first of a series of Conferences in which that aspect would, tend to be stressed.The main subjects of discussion, as announced beforethe Conference, had been Foreign Affairs and. Defence,tn the early part of the Conference there had. been onemorning when matters had. not gone well with ForeignAffairs.    The Canadian Prime Minister had. spoken in a -slightly isolationist spirit,   &quot;&quot;he Prime Minister of
New Zealand had -followed with a polite but rathercomprehens ive attack on the united Kingdom foreignpolicy.    General Hertzog had intimated the view thatour attitude towards the French was too warm, and towards the Germans too cold.    Even the AustralianDelegation had rather criticised our opposition to theAnschluss.   At the moment that had. produced rather a depressing effect, but he had felt that with education and patient communication of the facts all parties tothe Conference would get into line.    That was what had actually happened:    the attitude of the Dominions had.gradually swung round towards our own.   There was not,of course,   complete identity of view on every point,but there was a spirit of co-operation.   For example,Mr Savage would like a combined foreign policy of theEmpire, though Canada and South Africa could notapproach that.    In spite of differences of that kindthe spirit of co-operation had grown.Summing up the results in Foreign Affairs and defence, he said -(l) There had. been a complete exchange ofview on international affairs and defence:(2) As a result, the policies of therespective Governments were closerthan they had been before the Confer-ence:(?) The United. Kingdom had won the confidence of the Dominion Ministers who had satroun&apos;&quot; the table and who had come to trustin our sincerity, decent^ and wisdom.The Australian Prime Minister, of course, had neverexpressed any doubts.   Mr Savage, the Leader of a labour government in New Zealand, which was rather inclined to criticise our foreign policy, had. said roundly one day that if the United Kingdom was at war New Zealand wouldbe at war, whether the issue was right or wrong.General Hertzog on the previous evening had. said thatafter taking part in four Imperial Conferences he had-11t .
-IS-on the present, occasion felt, for the first time a feeling of kinship with ourselves.   Mr Mackenzie king was shout to visit Germany, where he would see herr hitler.   After expressing sympathy with Hitler&apos;sconstructive work and telling him of the sympathy whichwas felt with Germany in England , he intended, to add that if Germany should ever turn her mind from construe-1tive to destructive efforts against the United Kingdomall the Dominions would come to her/aid and that therewould be great numbers of Canadians anxious to swim the atlantic!    Wo doubt we should have our difficulties with the Dominions in the future, but. the Conference had been a great stride forward in the direction of unity.He thought much of the success was due to the skilfulan^ attractive Chairmanship of the Prime Minister.The Prime Minister,  confirming the general impression of the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, felt thatthe personal relations established should prove ofincalculable value in the future,   &quot;&quot;he Cabinet could besure that every question that was brought before theDominions would be examined with a desire to reach agreement.
CEYLON, 6.   The Cabinet had before there a Memorandum by theThe Brecegirdrle^Seeretary of State for the Colonies (C.P.-156 (37))Case.relating to the case of a Mr Bracegirdle, who, havingfailed to comply with an order by the Governor to leaveCeylon on account of Communistic activities, had been arrested       -so       that a. deportation order might becarried out.   The Governor&apos;s order was made under anOrder in Council passed in 1696, intended for use incase of war or any grave local emergency but still inoperation in Ceylon.    On an application for a writ ofhabeas corpus the Supreme Court of Ceylon had ruledthat the order for deportation was ultra vires .    It was understood, that Mr Bracegirdle was now considering .instituting civil proceedings against the Governorpersonally, claiming damages presumably for falseimprisonment, and the Governor asked, that a special new order in Council, indemnifying him and the other officers concerned, in the case, should be proceeded with immediately.    It was undesirable that the governor should be exposed to such an action;    but to pass anOrder in Council over the head of the Ceylon Legisla-and depriving a subject of his legal rightture/would be a strong step.    It might well be held that the proper constitutional course would, be for theGovernor to invite the local Legislature to pass ameasure providing such indemnity as might be required.In view of the decision of the Supreme Cc .irt theSecretary of State proposed to instruct the Governorformally to declare that the Order in Council of 1896had ceased to operate in Ceylon.    In the event of any emergency a.rising, recourse would be had to an Orderin Council of 1928.   He proposed also to consider thepossibility of passing fresh legislation in the CeylonState Council to provide for the deportation of Britishsubjects in proper circumstances.
The Secretary of State for the Coloniesexplained the whole matter to his colleagues.      In thecourse of his statement he read the following extractfrom a memorandum by the Legal Adviser to the ColonialOffice giving his reasons why he could find no justification for the use which had been made by theGovernor of the Order in Council of 1896:-&quot;I cannot find any justification for theuse which was made of this Order in Council by theGovernor and, to my mind, too much importance hasbeen placed upon the Secretary of State&apos;s despatchin 1928, seeing that that was sent nine years ago,and before Ceylon had been granted its present constitution,,The present constitution of Ceylon is,subject to certain safeguards, a form of self-government.      It is true that we have reserved theright to legislate by Order in Council, but I feellittle doubt that the intention of this reservationwas to enable us, if necessary, to deal withconstitutional matters and with matters of defence and other large Imperial interests.      To use that power in defiance (as we believe) of the will ofthe Legislature in Ceylon, to deprive an individualof his civil rights, seems to me to be unconstitutionaland not a proper exercise of the power.Further, I know of no reason why an individual who has suffered a wrong should be deprived of any remedy which he may have in a courtof law.      Such a thing would be quite impossiblehere, and I do not know why, or upon what principle,the liberty and rights of the subject should beless respected in Ceylon;    and the fact thatBracegirdle seems to be a thoroughly unpleasantperson does not seem to me to have any relevance tothe determination of questions which depend uponhigh constitutional principles.To my mind the spectacle of a Governor, orthe Chief of Police, being made subject to theconsequences of an illegal action is more likely to enhance the impartiality and integrity of british rule than is his protection from Downing Streetover the head of the Legislature in Ceylon, and at. - the expense of an individual whom he has wronged.&quot;He also read a private letter from the Chief Justice of ceylon addressed to an official in the Colonial office which had been shown to him and the purport of which wasto the same effect as the Legal Adviser&apos;s memorandum.
In the course of the discussion,  the LordChancellor expressed the view that it would not be possible to pass an Act depriving Mr. Bracegirdle, howeverobjectionable a person he might be, of his legal rights.In his view, the Governor, who had acted on constitutionaladvice, ought to be indemnified against the results of his action and there,were,jprob.ably others, policemen and-so forthwho acted on the Governor&apos;s decision who also must be protected.     He was inclined to follow the precedent ofthe Art 01Brien case in this country some years ago when an Act of Indemnity had been passed through parliament in the United Kingdom in order to protect the HomeSecretary and others concerned and an enquiry had been set up to assess the damages to be awarded.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, nfeile,agreeing.-pass an Act cf   Indemnitywith the proposal to/     urged that it would be undesirable to announce the Government&apos;s intention before the action was brought by Mr. Bracegirdle, since to do so might increase the amount of damages that would be awarded.The Secretary of State for the Colonies saidthat he had consulted Sir Baron Jayatilaka,  the Ministerfor Home Affairs in the Ceylon State Council, about thisproposal and he had told him that it was the one whichat the moment commended itself to him.     The CeylonMinister for Home Affairs, however, had not been willingto^commit himself to   a    view as to whether the CeylonState Council would pass the proposed legislation.      If not,the Governor would have to certify it. .  In ]reply to asuggestion that this would be somewhat embarrassing to thepresent Governor after what had happened, he pointed outthat certification would take place on the responsibilityof the Secretary of State for the Colonies and not theGovernor.      In any event, the present Governor was due to- 15 -
99yf6leave during the present Summer and certificationwould have to be made by his successor.In reply to the Prime Minister, he said thatthe recommendations in paragraph 12 of CP. 156 (37)should be carried out.The Prime Minister thought that this wasnecessary in order to bring out the point that,  inmaking a mistake, the Governor had done so on a technical issue.The Cabinet agreed:(a) To concur in the proposal of theSecretary of State for the colonies that he should instruct the Governorformally te declare that the Order inCoune.il of 1896 has ceased to be inoperation in Ceylon.      In the eventof any emergency arising,  recoursewould be had to the Order in Councilof 1928.      The Cabinet also took note that the Secretary of State was considering the possibility of passingfresh legislation in the Ceylon state council to provide for the deportation of British subjects in propercircumstancesi(b) That it would be necessary to indemnify the Governor and anyofficials who might have acted under his authority against any consequences(pecuniary or otherwise) which might follow from the action which theformer had taken on constitutionaladvice:(o) That any claims assessed by aCourt of Justice should (following the precedent of the -t^Brienpa-se)   be paid from the revenues of ceylon, but that this should not be announced publicly before mr. Bracegirdle&apos;s claims had-beenadjudicated:(d) That indemnification could best beobtained by the passing of thenecessary legislation by the CeylonState Council:(e) That,  if the Ceylon State Council didnot pass the legislation, the governor should be authorised to certify it..
(The Lord Advocate entered at this point.) 9AOTS 7. The Cabinet had before them the following docu-1935&apos;.arrangements:-i of.A Joint Memorandum by the Minister ofAgriculture an^ Fisheries and the Secretaryof State for Scotland (CP.-152 (37))cet seeking the concurrence of their colleagues58 to the&quot;preparation of a Bill, to be passed on- into law before the Summer Recess, to extend9 &amp; for a further year, until September 30, 1938,x.) the period during which Exchequer grants may, / v- be made under the Milk Acts, 1934 and 1936,pr ZH3// - in respect of milk used for manufacture, andalso to provide for further Exchequer grantson existing lines for the Milk-in-Schoolsscheme   and other schemes for increasing thedemand for milk.    It was hoped that beforethe end of the year- to be covered by theproposed extending Act a measure to giveeffect to the Government&apos;s long-term milkpolicy would be on the Statute Book.   TheMinisters proposed that the present Billshould, adhere as  closely as possible to theorieinal intention of the 1934 Act, but thatpayments in respect of milk manufactured inNorthern Ireland should be discontinued:A. Note by the Minister of Health (C .P.-154(37)) pointing out that a number of assuranceshad been given in both Houses of parliament that the Government had under consideration the development of schemes for providingcheap milk to mothers and infants, and thatthe amount of money which it was intendedto provide under the Bill would do no morethan suffice for the Milk-in-Schools schemeand possible extensions of that scheme.The Bill would undoubtedly meet with criticism on that score, but he thought the force of itwould be much reduced if in any announcementof long-term policy made before the Recessit was possible to hold out an expectation that the re-organis?tion of the indusrty was likely to result in a reduction of theprice of liquid milk either generally orfor special classes of consumers, includingmothers and infants.In the course of a discussion In&quot; which the points of view of the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, theMinister of Health, the President of the Board of EducationChancellor *f the Exchequer were put forward, it was foundthat the whole matter required further exploration in its political and financial aspects..The Cabinet accordingly agreed:That a Cabinet Committee composed as follows:The Chancellor of the exchequer the Secretary of State for scotland the Minister of Agriculture and fisheries the Minister of health the President of the Board of education should consider the documents prepared for

The discussion began by consideration of thequestion of principle in regard to the Departments to administer Part IV of the Agriculture Bill, theconclusions of which are set forth below.On the conclusion of the above discussion,the Lord President of the Council raised three other points, namely -(l)   A point of principle and procedure thatas sometimes happened in the case of otherBills, the present Bill contained aproposal that had not been before theCabinet when the subject matter of theBill had been under discussion, viz. -(2)    The inclusion in Clause 9 of the Bill ofpowers to prevent negligent farming.     Hecriticised this as being of doubtfuleffectiveness and asked why such powers were required for oats and barley when they werenot included in the case of wheat:(3)    The Bill would create a new statutorycommittee named the Land Fertility Committee.He thought the land community were gettingrather tired of the appointment of newhighly paid committees and he suggested thatsome other machinery for the administrationof the Bill might be created.The Minister of Agriculture and fisheries said he had no t   overlooked the point that it would benecessary to introduce new matter into the Bill, sincethe subject had first been considered by the Cabinet.His intention had been to draw the attention of theCabinet to this but this had been impossible because,owing to the Imperial Conference,  there had been nomeeting of the Cabinet in the previous week.     As time had been pressing, therefore, he had brought the bill before the Committee of Home Affairs.     As regards thesecond point,namely, negligent farming, he pointed outthat the subsidy in the case of the Wheat Act waspayable on the amount of wheat of millable quality which provided a check since,if the farming was bad   and thejidcL ff- - ext+r^millable quality was few, the payment was small.      In
the case of barley or oats, however, payment was to bemade on an acreage basis and some check/had to be CJprovided.     He had followed the same method as had beenadopted in the case of the Corn Production Act, 1917,and the^ieat Act of 1920, where the subsidy had been on an acreage basis.       As regards the third criticism,namely the Land Fertility Committee, this was not acase, he thought, where the members of the Committeewould all be highly paid.     He recalled that in thecase of the Cattle Committee, for example, most ofthe members received no remuneration.     He would gladly reconsider the name of the Committee if that wasobjected to.     It was, however, necessary to have somecentral organisation.The Minister of Health said that theCommittee of Home Affairs had devoted a great deal oftime to the consideration of this Bill and had a very useful discussion.The Prime Minister said that as there was amatter of urgency to be brought before the Cabinet, he must adjourn the discussion at this point.The Cabinet agreed:(a)   That a.. Cabinet committee composed as follows:-The Secretary of State for India(In the Chair)The President of the Board of trade the Minister of Healthwith the assistance ofThe Minister of Agriculture andFisheriesThe Secretary of State for scotland should examine and advise theCabinet on the question of principlewhether the administration of Part IVlof the Agriculture Bill should beentrusted throughout Great britain to a unified veterinary service,or in Scotland to the ScottishDepartment of Agriculture:- 21 - .
(b) That the above Committee should beasked to report at the next weekly meeting of the Cabinet.(The Lord Advccate left at this point.)
