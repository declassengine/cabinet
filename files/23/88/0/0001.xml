SPAIN. 1. The Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsTHE NON- &apos; reported that at a Meeting of the Non-interventionINTERVENTIONCOMMITTEE. Committee on the previous day the Italian ambassador had announced that he could not join in a discussion(previous reference: on the withdrawal of volunteers from Spain.    AfterCabinet 10(37), Con- the Meeting he himself had seen the French Ambassador,elusion 1.)who was a good deal troubled at this development and pr.R.iu-(v?)*.apprehended that the French Government might insist that if the subject of withdrawal of volunteers wasnot discussed by some particular date they would havetowardsto reconsider their attitude   / the Non-intervention committee.    M.  Corbin had expressed th-^ belief thatthe Italian forces East of Madrid were regular troops.The Secretary of State had replied that he was notat all convinced of this and that we had some informa-tion to show that they were composed of rather poormaterial.    The Ambassador had then given the names ofthe four Italian Generals who, he said, were regulars.The Non-intervention Committee had not been able toarrange another Meeting and was adjourned indefinitely.In reply, to a question the Secretary of Stateadded that the Italian Ambassador had, as mentionedin the Press, made a personal remark to the effectthat for his part he hoped that no Italian volunteerswould be withdrawn until the insurgents had achievedvictory.    It was difficult to say how far this remarkwas hasty or deliberate.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thenmentioned a difficulty that had arisen on the- schemeitself, namely, as to the responsibility of thedifferent nations in the various Spanish ports.    Upto that very morning the Italians had been unwilling to agree, but ten minutes before the Cabinet he had learned that Signor Grandi had accepted the scheme.
A Meeting was to take place the same afternoon to approve the scheme, which, if no further hitchoccurred, should come into operation in about ten days&apos; time.The Secretary of State added, a little later,that if within the next few days the Non-intervention committee was not to break down he would have to bevery active diplomatically.
gTHE SITUATIONIN SPAIN.Attitude ofthe TradesUnion Con-gress.2. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that he had received the TradesUnion Congress Council and had discussed with them the situation in Spain.    Their attitude had been veryreasonable, and on the day following the meeting the&quot;Daily Herald&quot; had published a very satisfactoryleading article supporting non-intervention. .  Themembers of the Council,- however, had admitted thatthey were rather worried at the present position.
SPAIN. 3. The Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe Italian informed the Cabinet that the Italian Ambassador hadReverses.spoken to the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of Statef:R.\U-[&apos;il)z- for Foreign Affairs about the British Press reportsof the recent Italian reverses north-east of Madrid,and had stated that Signor Mussolini was annoyed attheir tenor. He had indicated that the point mightbe brought up later on&apos;, not at the Non-intervention committee, but through the diplomatic channel.
Attitude of press, Pariiamerit and theBritish broadcasting corporation.FOREIGN AFFAIRS. 4. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that the diificulties of the present situation were being very much increased by the attitude of thePress and Parliament.    For example, that afternoonno less than 25 Questions had been addressed to him,and some of them were calculated to irritate signor mussolini.    In spite of efforts, in which he had hadthe co-operation of the.Prime Minister, to avoid a debate on Foreign Affairs on the morrow, the questionof the massacres at Addis Ababa was to be raised onthe Motion for Adjournment for the Easter Recess.He had been considering whether any action could betaken with a view to obtaining assistance from theLeaders of the Opposition Parties in modifying theattitude of some of their supporters.    He himself was prepared to see the Leaders of the Opposition in anynumbers that were necessary.In the course of a short discussion the cabinet were reminded that the British Broadcasting Corpora-. tion published daily bulletins in regard to Spain, aswell as weekly talks, and that these had a widespreadeffect resulting in pressure being put by constituentson Members of Parliament.    If the British broadcasting corporation could be induced to drop their nightlystatements it was suggested that it would have aquietening effect.Much sympathy was expressed with the difficultiesraised for the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsby ill-timed publicity methods.The Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should confer with the PrimeMinister immediately after the meeting with a view to avoiding the raising ofthe Abyssinian massacres in the Houseof Commons on the following day.
SPAIN. 5. The Secretary of State for Foreign AffaireThreatened Inter-said that he had received a telegram stating that theference with british Ship-       Insurgent Government complained that British vesselsping.are trading with Spanish Government ports and thatKRjiriyj)^-    OIxe 0f them, on being questioned, had had the &quot;impertinence&quot;to reply that she was bound for Catalonia witha general cargo.    The telegram    also    contained asuggestion that the Nationalist Fleet might be takingfurther steps to restrict the movements of british shipping.    He proposed to confer with the admiralty on the subject, and he informed his colleagues thatit might be necessary to issue a new warning to theInsuigent Gove rnment.
6. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that he had had an interesting conversationwith our Commercial Attache in Spain, who had rathercriticised the proposal to appoint Sir Robert Hodgsonas an Agent to the Insurgent Government, on the groundthat it would make his own position rather difficult.The Secretary of State proposed, therefore, for thepresent to postpone further action with a view toSir Robert Hodgson&apos;s appointment and to allow theCommercial Attache to go back to Burgos, wherecommercial negotiations were conducted, and to rely on him for the present.The Cabinet approved this proposal.
SPAIN. 7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, inThe Case of       reply to a question, said that he was doing the bestBritishDeserters. he could about British deserters from the Spanisharmies, but the matter was beset with great difficul-
THE london naval TREATY,1956.(previous reference:Cabinet 55(36), Con-elusion 3. )8. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that, as the result of strong representations which he had recently made to Moscow, the russian soviet Government was now prepared to sign the naval treaty of 1936.    Up to now the difficulties raisedby the Russian Soviet Government had operated toprevent the signature of the Treaty by Germany also.He hoped now, however, that both Germany and SovietRussia would sign the Treaty.
9. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported on the latest developments of the Belgiansecurity question, which included a conversation hehad had with the King of the Belgians.    The most urgent Belgian requirement was to he released from,the undertakings she assumed last March, when it wasagreed that, notwithstanding the withdrawal from,and the repudiation by Germany of, the Treaty of locarno, this Treaty should continue in force provi-provisionally between Great Britain, France and Belgium.The French Government had agreed, and suggested thatthe Belgian Government should be told that the Britishand French Governments were prepared to release them from the above undertakings.    He proposed that an exchange of Notes should take place between theUnited Kingdom, France and Belgium, with this object.Further- policy could then be considered under lesspressure.The French had also asked that , when&quot;liberatingBelgium, it should be made clear that the arrangements of last March should continue in force as between theUnited Kingdom and France.    This was the more desir-able in that it implied that the provisional period was still running and that the &quot;effort of conciliation&quot;had not failed and that therefore our undertakingscontained in the letter of April 1st last could not be invoked.After a short discussion the Cabinet agreed  (a) To authorise the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs to enter on an exchange of Notes between the Govern-ments of the United Kingdom, Franceand Belgium with a view to the release- of the latter from the undertakings. assumed last March:
(b) To authorise the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs to. make clear atthe same time that the arrangements of last March shall continue in force as between the United Kingdom andFrance:(c) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should circulatedocuments on these questions.-11-
THE INTER-NATIONALSUGAR CON-PERENOE.british policy.(previous reference:Cabinet 9(37), Con-clusion 6,)10.    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Lord President of the Council (CP.-102 (37))in connection with the International Sugar conference which would   be opening in London on April 5th.At the end of his Memorandum the Lord Presidentrecommended that, subject always to developments inthe course of the Conference, the Cabinet should authorise the United Kingdom Delegation to pursue the policy set forth in the Appendix to these Minutes.The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that theChancellor1 of the Exchequer, who was absent indisposed,had told him that he was much opposed to any relaxation-tion of the present limits on home production of beetsugar.The Minister of Agricu^ure and Fisheries pointedout that the Lord President&apos;s Memorandum now made itclear that the 560,000 ton limit would not be throwninto the arena at the start but was a concession whichwe should be prepared to make if necessary in orderto reach agreement.    As a matter of negotiation it was going to be difficult to persuade some foreign government to reduce their production below the peakyear of production.    He urged, therefore, that as amatter of tactics our limit of 560,000 tons shouldnot be mentioned until we had ascertained whether these other countries would agree to reduce below their peak level.    If they did, then it could be announced.    In this connection the political diffi-culties in this country had to be kept in mind, andmore especially the increasing pressure in parliament in favour of. greater home production of sugar as a defence measure.    In present circumstances no reductionof our limit of 560,000 tons could be contemplated,.,and it might even be desirable at the outset to mentiona higher figure, such as the peak figure of 600,000.-12-
In reply to a question, the Lord President ofthe Council said that in the present negotiationswe were only contemplating binding ourselves for aperiod of five years.The view was expressed that the Chancellor of theExchequer&apos;s note quoted by the Prime Minister had probably arisen in connection with Conclusion 6 (a)and (b), on page 12 of CP.-102 (37), which reads asfollows:-&quot;(6) As part of the principles to be followed in the revision of export quotas under(5) above the United Kingdom delegation should aim at securing(a) if and when the aggregate quotasof the foreign 1 exporting countries1have been increased by a certainpercentage (to be negotiated)British Empire supplies (i.e.,United Kingdom production plusDominion and Colonial exports)should be increased pro rata withany further quota increases:(b) British Empire supplies should alsobe increased pro rata with any increase in consumption in the.United Kingdom plus Canada. &quot;Since, however, it was provided in recommendation1 (a) that the United Kingdom production should belimited to 560,000 tons of white sugar per annum, andthis limitation was actually fixed by Statute, theCabinet felt that the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;position was adequately safeguarded.The Prime Minister pointed out that the Chancellorof the Exchequer would see the Minutes, and as theConference did not meet until April 5th he would beable to raise the point if he was not satisfied.The Lord President, referring to the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries&apos; point, said that he wouldbe careful, in his Opening Address as President ofthe Conference, to make no reference to the 560,000ton limit.
The Lord President then informed the Cabinet thathe was being pressed as to whether the policy of theGovernment was one of self-sufficiency of.the empire in the natter of sugar.    He proposed to say thatself-sufficiency of the Empire was not part of thepolicy of the Government.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries ratherdemurred to the making of any categorical statementbinding us for the future that Empire policy shouldnot be one of self-sufficiency.The Lord President said that his statement would refer to the period covered by this Conference only.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs saidthat there were some Dominions, including Australiaand the Irish Free State, which aimed at self-sufficient-ency, but this was not the case in respect of Canada.New Zealand proposed to  row.sugar, but 4^-wo^-ld tafee-fehein Domo^4ojjtj^ before^tacjf could-^ self-sufficient.He did not think that, from the point of view of theDominions, the Lord President&apos;s answer was open to any objection, for the reason that several of them didnot seek, or were not within sight of, self-sufficiency.The Lord President said that he was meetingrepresentatives of the Dominions and Colonies the same afternoon.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries drew attention to paragraph 13 (8) of the Lord President&apos;sMemorandum.    He pointed out that it would not do forus to give an unqualified undertaking to reduce the sugar Subsidy as and when prices rise.    The Act of1936 provides that the effective rate of subsidy shallvary inversely with a number of factors, one of whichis the price of sugar.    To that extent the point hadbeen met.    It was, however, possible that in certain
circumstances higher prices might more than off-set any saving due to higher sugar pi ices, and this the Act definitely contemplated;    in such circumstances the subsidy could not &quot;be reduced.    He asked, therefore,that in the second line of paragraph 13 (8) the words&quot;other things &quot;being equal&quot; should he added after thewo rd &quot;unde rt ake&quot;.This was agreed to.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the policy proposed in the&apos;Memorandum by the Lord President of theCouncil (CP.-102 (37)), subject to theaddition in line 2 of paragraph 13 (8)of the words &quot;other things being equal&quot;after the word &quot;undertake&quot;:(NOTE:    The effect of this will beseen in the Appendix tothese Minutes, where thenew words are underlined):(b) That the limitation of United kingdom production to 560,000 tons of whitesugar per annum should not be comrnuni-cated to the Conference at the outset,but in the early stages should be treatedas a concession which we should be preparedto make if necessary to reach agreement:(c) That notwithstanding (b) there was no intention to relax the present liiiiitson the home production of beet sugar.If the Chancellor of the Exchequer feltany doubts on the subject it was notedthat there would be time for him to reopen the question before the meetingof the Conference:(d) That the Lord President of the council should be authorised to make clear thatit was not the policy of the UnitedKingdom Government, so far as the period covered by the results of the comingConference was concerned, to seek self-sufficiency in sugar .fbr the BritishEmpire.
AIR&apos;RAID PRE-CAUTIONS.Need for legislation.(previous reference:Cabinet 9(37), Con-clusion 10.)(37)4.11* The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Home Secretary (CP.-99 (37)) seeking authorityfor the preparation of legislation with the objects of placing Government expenditure on air raid pre-cautions on a proper statutory basis and of removingexisting doubts as to the power of Local Authoritiesto spend money on air raid services for which theyhave been asked by the Government to make themselvesresponsible.    The provisions to be included in theBill must be the subject of further consideration in the light of decisions which would shortly bereached by the Defence Policy and requirements committee, but in the meantime an announcement inthe House of Commons as to the Governments intentionto legislate might be necessary.In the course of a short discussion someemphasis was placed on the serious concern of thelocal authorities to which the Home Secretary had called attention f\n page 2 of his memorandum.The Cabinet were informed that it had been hoped that the new Block Grant Seheme would enable aconsiderable improvement to be made in the various services of the local authorities &quot;but that, if those authorities were to be involved in heavy expenditure for Air raid precautions, this would militateagainst the improvements.The Home Secretary did not dissent from theabove view, but pointed out that, as stated in thelast paragraph of his memorandum, concrete proposals were being submitted to the Defence Policy and requirements Sub-Committee, whose recommendations would, of course, have to come before the Cabinet,The point mentioned above could then be raised*
The Cabinet agreed:(a) To authorise the Home Secretary toprepare legislation on the subject ofair raid precautions and to take note that an announcement in the House ofCommons as to the intention to legislate might he necessary:(b) To take note that concrete proposals were about to be submitted to theDefence Policy and Requirements Sub-Committee, whose recommendations would be submitted to the Cabinet when an opportunity would be provided forconsideration of all relatedquestions of policy including thoseaffecting local governments:(c) That the Home Secretary, in.preparing his proposals, should keepin touch with the Minister of health and the Secretary of State forScotland^
THE CALEDONIANPOWER ORDER,1937.The Productionof Calcium&apos; Carbide.proposed committee.(previous reference:Cabinet 10(37), Con-elusion 3. )12.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister for Co-ordination of Defence (CP.-100(37)) proposing1 that, in accordance with an Answerhe had given in the House of Commons on January 15th,a. Committee of three persons unconnected with the issues raised, consisting of a Member of the upper house as Chairman together with two men of general engineering and business training, should be set up with the following suggested Terms of Reference:-&quot;To consider and report on any schemes which may be submitted to them for theproduction of calcium carbide and allied products in the United Kingdom,with particular reference to the schemeembodied in the Caledonian Water Power-Bill,  1937&quot;.After receipt of their Report the Government couldagain review the more political considerations involved, including the large question whether theneed of home production of calcium carbide was sufficiently strong on Service and industrialgrounds to justify the imposition of a duty and the consequential amendment ol the Norwegian trade agreement under which the article is now importedfree, and also the effect on the using industries of a duty.A good deal of discussion took place on the suggested draft Terms of Reference which, after several suggestions had been considered, were amended as shown below.Various suggestions were made as to the personnel of the Committee.     One of the names in thememorandum was criticised on the ground that he was a ship-owner and another en the ground that he was concerned in a company which was a large consumer ofcarbideB     The Cabinet were reminded, however, that the
particular ship-owner was not concerned, in Norwegiantrade and   that   business was so inter-connectedthat it was not easy to find persons against whomsome sort of criticism could not be directed.     Onesuggestion was that persons in the Government service should not necessarily be excluded, but the Gabinetwere informed that their exclusion had been providedfor in an announcement in the House of Commons.     If,such personhowever, there was some /   whom the Minister for the government-Ordination of Defence regarded as particularlysuitable, it was suggested that his inclusion, in theCommittee need not necessarily be debarred by theParliamentary statement, as a further explanatorystatement could easily be issued.     Among alternativenames suggested were Viscount Falmouth andSir Gilbert Morgan, O.B.E., F.R.S., the latter aGovernment official.The Minister of Transport emphasised theimportance of not overlooking the effect of any proposals that might be made on the electrical grideHe reserved the right to raise it if necessary as oneof the political considerations to be taken intoaccount by the Cabinet when the Report was underconsideration^The Secretary of State for Scotlandmentioned that there were one or two points of detail&apos;on which he did not agree with the memorandum by theMinister for the Go-Ordination of Defence but that theydid not affect the decision of the Cabinet.The Cabinet agreed:(a)   To approve in principle theproposals of the Minister for theCo-Ordination of Defence as setforth in CP. 100 (37),
That the Terms of Reference should be amended to read as follows:-&quot;To consider and report as to therelative advantages of any schemes which may be submitted to themfor the production of calcium carbide and allied products in theUnited Kingdom,&quot;That the Minister for the Co-Ordinationof Defence should have authority to select the personnel of and to se.t upthe Sub-Committee of the Committee ofImperial Defences
THE&apos; SHEEP STOCKSVALUATION(SCOTLAND)BILL.(previous reference:Cabinet, 67(36), Con-clusion 13.)13.

The general idea of the Billseemed to be a right one, namely, to prohibit the publicexhibition of films in the production of which sufferingwas caused to animalscSince, however, the Genshorship Panelincluded representatives of the Veterinary Profession,there appeared little likelihood of filcje of this nature being shown in this country.As there appeared to be little prospect ofthe Bill being taken by the House of Commons (beingthird on the list), no decision was taken.the cinema to-I&quot; GRAPH FILMS(ANIMALS) BILL,i

The Cabinet had before them the following documents in connection with the Marriage Bill,introduced by a Private Member and down for report and Third Reading in the House of Commons on Friday,April 16th:-A Memorandum by the Home Secretary(CP. -97 (37)), attaching a printof the Bill as amended in Committeeand.a short summary of its contents.The Government were likely to be   -asked, before the Report Stage began,what would be their attitude to theBill.    While it was hoped that thePrivate Members&apos; time available tothe Promoters would be sufficient forthe remaining stages of the Bill  in which case no special action ofthe Government would be necessary  the Home Secretary felt strongly thatthe Government should not let the Billlapse, having got so far, merely forwant of supplying a little more time if that was all that was needed toget it through by a substantial majority of the Bouse:A Memorandum by the Lord Chancellor(CP.-98 (37)) calling attention tothe effect on the work of His Majesty&apos;sJudges in the Probate, Divorce and admiralty Division if the Bill in itspresent form became law;   pointing out the congested state of business in the Division;    and proposing that parliament should be asked to sanctiona permanent addition of one Judge,. together with an addition of anotherwhose re-appointment should becontingent upon the passing of aResolution by both Houses whensatisfied that the work of the division was such as to require the vacancy to be filled.In the course of a short discussion, theCabinet were informed that there was some evidence ,of   ae change of attitude towards the Bill in theHouse of Commons owing&apos; to changes that had been madein the Committee Stage, and there was a possibility that it might be rejected on the Report Stage.THE MARRIAGEBILL.(previous reference:Cabinet 69(36), Con-elusion 11.)FR.lt(37)t.
