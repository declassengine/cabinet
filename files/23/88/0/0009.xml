1.  &quot;?he Cabinet had before them the following documents on the subject of Increasing the Product-ivity of the Soil,  consideration of which had. been postponed at the Meeting mentioned in the margin:-A Memorandum by the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries (CP.-117(37))  covering an Interim Report byan Inter-Depprtmental Committee setup in accordance with Conclusion 3 (d.)FK. 7J7.iyj)  of Cabinet 9 (37).    The Minister&quot; U-p fi%)i^ recommended the adoption of the1 Committee&apos;s proposals, which should.be rega.rded. as linked, up with theGovernment&apos;s general policy for restoring the prosperity, product-ivity and. efficiency of home agriculture, and sought authorityto prepare the necessary Bill.Attached, to the main Report was a supplementary Report on the questionof Assistance for Oats and Barley,but the Committee had. not agreed, upon any recommendation in that  connection:A Memorandum, by the Secretary of Statefor Scotland. (CP .-125 (37)) pointing out the difficulties that would be created if no assistance were providedfor Scottish oat and barley growers;suggesting that if no general schemefor Great Britain was found to be feasible, there should, be a separateallocation to Scotland of funds to beapplied to an arable policy appropriate to her conditions;    and asking that thepossibilities of a separate Scottishscheme should be fully explored, before any announcement was made of the proposalregarding wheat:A further Memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Scotland ( CP.-13 6 (37))elaborating, at the request of theChancellor of the Exchequer, his suggestionthat, failing a general scheme, a separateallocation be made to Scotland of funds to be applied to an arable policy appro-priate to her conditions, and. proposing a s\im. of approximately  150,000 fromTreasury funds, on the understandingthat no further increase in beet-suga,racreage was to be allowed, in Scotland.-^his arrangement, he believed, would beregarded, as a fair settlement of a long-standing dispute, and would, remove thegrievance that assistance was being given to arable cultivations for whichft all might theoretically qualify but which in practice proved, inapplicableto Scotland.agricultural policy.productivity of the Soil.(previous reference:Cabinet go(37), Con-clusion io *)
The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries saidthat he had received a letter from the President ofthe Board of Trade, who was unable to be present andwho would have raised  certain questions of detailhad he been present.^he Minister of Agriculture andFisheries undertook to consult the President of the Board ofTrad.e on the points in question.The Minister of Agriculture and. Fisheries then made a full explanation of his proposals to theCabine t.Later in the discussion, in reply to questions,he said that, originally he had hoped to be able to announce his policy before the Coronation Recess.There remained, however,  certain enquiries andconsultations to be undertaken before an announcementcould be made .In the matter of fertilizer-s he had been able to consult the interests concerned with basic slag, whichwere very limited in number?   but in the matter oflime he had not. felt justified in going far in con-consultations with the more numerous interests  concernedin that commodity.The Secretary of State for Scotland then outlinedhis proposals in regard, to oats -*bedU^gra?^ey.In the discussion which followed it became clearthat the proposals of the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries commended themselves to the Cabinet.   Theadoption of the Secretary of State for Scotland&apos;sproposals for assistance to oats adad^tea^feey were foundto be beset with too many dif-faculties; but it was realised that the adoption of the proposals mentionedabove for England and Wales would meet with a gooddeal of opposition and criticism if some simultaneousassistance was not provided for Scottish agriculture.
i -o 9One suggestion for meeting this difficulty. was to drop the proposals for assistance- to wheat, but theMinister of Agriculture and Fisheries represented that he would have great, difficulty in defending his proposals as a whole without including that item.The Cabinet were reminded, that the various proposals before them had arisen out of the discus-sion of schemes for storage of food in time of war,%*. Sti^JalA Food storage was not only difficult but expensive,iL, UU*J- fid-   I and. the extent to which schemes for increasing the productivity of the soil replaced food storage might.be taken into account in reckoning their cost the Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the proposals of the Ministerof Agriculture and Fisheries for inereas-ing the productivity of the soil, as set-forth in CP.-117 (37), by means of:-(i) The extension of existing facilitiesfor land, drainage by means of&quot;Exchequer grants .(ii) The promotion of the increased&apos;useof lime and basic slag by a schemefor ensuring cheap supplies to farmers.(iii) The raising o^ the limit to the&quot;anticipated supply&quot; under theWheat Act, 1932, from 5 million to 8 million quarters with a viewto giving greater assurance to farmers in respect of their returnsfrom wheat and. thereby stimulatingan increase in the wheat acreage.(iv) Measures for the improvement ofgrassland cultivation.(v) mhe initiation of a. large-scalecampaign for the eradication of animal diseases with a view tothe elimination of the very heavywastage at present caused by suchdiseases, thereby securing improved,productivity of the livestockindustry:    and the extension forthis purpose of the State VeterinaryService.(b) That the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries should be authorised to consult the various agricultural and industrial interests  concerned in these proposals,but that he should make no public state-ment until after the Parliamentary Recess:
That in the meanwhile the Secretary ofState for Scotland, in consultation withthe Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries,the Minister for Co-ordination of defence and a representative of the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, should consider some formof appropriate assistance to Gr&amp;j&amp;srbsgaragriculture as an alternatave^J^o--trlieproposals in C__?_^=12^--(-3-?i  and CP .-136
