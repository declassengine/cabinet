THE BUDGET.(previous reference:Cabinet 29(35)3.)FR.5Ll.-(37)/3.1. The Chancellor of the Exchequer communicatedto the Cabinet full details of his financial proposalsfor the forthcoming Budget, which were approved by theCabinet.In view of the great importance of secrecy, thedetails, in accordance with precedent, are not recorded in the Cabinet Minutes.
2. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade ( CP.-116 (-37))  drawing attention to the following instructions issued by theBoard of Trade to the Shipowners parliamentary committee as a result of a meeting of theCabinet Committee on the Protection of british shipping on Friday, 16th April:-&quot;Our present information goes to showthat other Basque ports as well asBilbao are not free from risk.   the degree of risk may vary from day today.    We cannot therefore adviseproceeding, but in any case we shall,if called upon, give protection onthe high seas as already announced,&quot;and asking the Cabinet to consider whether theGovernment were to maintain the position with ship-owners that we cannot advise proceeding to Santanderand Gijon or North Spanish ports other than Bilbao,or, alternatively, whether it should not be made clear to all concerned (including General Franco) thatwe are not influencing shipowners against visitingthose ports (excluding Bilbao) and that ships goingto those ports will, as already decided, have protec-tion on the high seas.The President of the Board, of Trade, after drawing attention to the reasons given in his Memorandumagainst  continuing to influence ships against goingto Santander, added that, shortly before the Meetingof the Cabinet, he had received a communication fromthe British Iron and Steel Trade Federation statingthat the position as to supplies of iron ore wasprecarious, that 60,000 tons of ore were receivednormally from Bilbao every month, that those supplies were of great importance, that only three small ships had arrived in the last week, and. pressing that british ships should be allowed to&apos;go to Santander and Gijonto fet ch ore.
The First Lord of the Admiralty had some hesitation-tion in advising on this matter.    The stretch of coastinvolved, about 100 miles in length, was an indivisibleunit,    and pr   in the absence of any opposition at seafrom the side of the Government forces, the insurgentforce, which included one battleship, one cruiser(with two more reported to be on their way), a destroyer,a submarine and some trawlers,  could easily be moved from one port to another to enforce a blockade.   As tomines, some had been laid by the Government forces for defensive purposes, and reports had been received of alleged offensive minelaying by the insurgents.On the whole he thought it risky to differentiate between Bilbao and other perts on this  coast.It was suggested that the Government mines werecontrolled mines and that the absence of casualties   -to several merchant ships known to have entered, and-left the port during the. past week, indicated that therisk from.mines was small.While there was general agreement that ships could not be advised that Santander and Gijon weresafe, apprehensions were expressed lest our ships should be excluded from these ports by mere bluff.One suggestion was that the safety of a ship might turn on the nature of the cargo carried .   A shipcarrying coal for the mines and returning with eremight be less liable to interference than a shipbringing food.The Cabinet agreed  (a)  That the President of the Board of trade should issue the following revised advicete the shipowners  concerned&quot;Our present information does netenable us to advise entry into Bilbao.As regards other ports, such asSantander and Gijon, there is a degreeof risk which may vary from day today, but in any ease we, shall, ifcalled, upon, give protection on thehigh seas as already announced.&quot;
1A f)10(b) That the First Lord of the admiralty should inform the Naval authoritiesoff the Spanish coast of (a) and issuesuch fresh instructions to them as he might deem appropriate to the distinctiondrawn between Eilbao and other ports:( e) mo take note that, as emphasised by theFirst Lord of the Admiralty, the convoy of British merchant, ships along thecoast of Spain would raise a big question and could not at present be adopted,   ^hemethod of implementing our undertaking to give protection to British shipping on the high seas must be left to theAdmiralty and the Naval Commanders-in-Chief concerned:( d) That/the Leader of the Opposition LabourParty should carry out his announcedintention to raise these matters on the adjournment on the following day, theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs,the First- Lord of the Admiralty and thePresident of the Board of Trade shouldbe available to take part in a debateaccording to the particular issues tobe raised, - a point, on which inquiry-was being made through the usual  channels.2 , 7/hit ehai 1 Sard ens , S . \V. 1,April 19, 193 7.
