&apos;ALESTINE. 1. In accordance with, the Conclusion referred to inteport of the    the margin, the Cabinet held, a Special Meeting mainlyoyal Commis-ion, 1936.       with the object of considering a revised draft,prepared by the Secretary of State for the Colonies,Previous(Reference-&apos;       of the proposed Statement of Policy by His Majesty&apos;cabinet 27(3 7)y Con-       Government regarding the recommendations of theel us ion 3 .)Palestine Royal Commission, which was to be released.FK. x^7)Z.for publication as a Command Paper, simultaneously withthe Report itself, on the evening of Wednesday, July7th (CP.-171 (37)) .In addition, the Cabinet had. before them the memoranda by the Secretary of State for the colonies which had been under consideration at the previous meeting, viz., CP.-163 (37),  CP.-166 (37)  and C.P.-169 (37), together with a Memorandum by the Secretaryof State for far ( CP,-174 (37))   circulating an extractfrom a telegram from the Genera.! Officer Commanding theBritish Forces in Palestine and Trans-Jordan, givingthe latter&apos;s first thoughts on the Report and possible reactions thereto.The Secretary of State for the Colonies communicatedcertain minor amendments in the draft Wnit-T Paper whichhad. been suggested to him.   These are included, in theConclusions of the Cabinet set forth below.Paragr^ phs 5.  4 and. 7 .    The suggestions to theSecretary of State for the Colonies had included the omission of the whole of paragraph 7 except the firstwords,  &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government propose to advise his Majesty accordingly&quot;.A suggestion was made that these words, which belong to the main decision, should, be inserted, either at theend. of paragraph 3 or the beginning of paragraph 4.The decision was to include it at the end. of para-graph 3,\with a verbal amendment to the first sentence
0 1 Q4 ajof paragraph 4, as given in the Conclusions.The phrase in the ninth line of paragraph 3,  &quot;onthe general lines recommended by the Commission&quot;^ was criticised on the ground that the words &quot;general lines&quot;might he interpreted as meaning &quot;boundary linesespecially when the paragraph was translated.    It wassuggested, that it might be better to use some suchphrase as  &quot;of the general character&quot;, or  &quot;on thegeneral basis&quot;, or &quot;of the kind&quot;.The Secretary of State for the Colonies thought there was no serious risk of the present wording beingmisinterpreted, and it was decided to retain them.The question was raised as to whether the following words in the second and third lines o^ paragraph 4 weredesirable,  &quot;having regard to their existing treaty obligations under the Covenant of the League of Nations&quot;.It was a.sked whether it would not be better to substitutesome such phrase as &quot;their existing international obligations&quot;.The Secretary of State for the Colonies and othermembers of the Cabinet, preferred, to retain the referenceto the League of Nations, and the amendment was not pressed .Paragraph 6.    The Secretary of St^te for the Coloniespointed out that in the first line the word  &quot;or&quot; was amisprint, for &quot;of&quot;.Some discussion took place as to whether the words&quot;while the form of a scheme of partition is being worked out&quot; were appropriate.    It was suggested that they mightbe interpreted by those who objected to the schemeto indicate that if only sufficient opposition was raised the scheme of the Royal Commission would be dropped.The Cabinet were informed, however, that the words hadbeen designed to avoid this and merely to convey the idea
that the final form of partition was not fixed.Various alternatives were suggested: e.g.,&quot;whilethe details incidental to the proposals of the RoyalCommission are being worked, out&quot;;    &quot;while the form of partition is being worked out&quot;: or the omission of thewords altogether, so that the paragraph would begin&quot;In the immediate future His Majesty&apos;s government propose that, as an interim measure, steps should betaken to prohibit any land transactions which might prejudice such a scheme&quot;; or, again,  &quot;while thedetails of the scheme of partition are being worked,out&quot; .The Cabinet were urged to adopt a formula whichwould allow a measure of fluidity in the situation.From a strategical point of view, for example, it was desirable to keep the situation open as regards Haifa,and in particular it might prove desirable from thispoint of view to retain it permanently under thecontrol of His Majesty&apos;s Government.The Prime Minister thought it would be best toleave it to the Colonial Secretary to draft in thelight of the discussion.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said thatthe Government of Palestine had. suggested no alteration in this paragraph.   He himself preferred the words inthe paragraph.It was decided to allow the sentence to stand.Para.graph 7.    See amendment given under paragraph 3,namely, to omit all the words after &apos;&apos;accordingly&quot; andto transfer the first words of the paragraph to theend of the present paragraph 3.The Chancellor of the Exchequer desired the omission of the last four lines on the ground that thefinancial aspects were sufficiently covered by the
following words in paragraph 8:-&quot;The Arah State would receive financialassistance on a substantial scale both from His Ma jesty&apos;s Government and fromthe Jewish State&quot;.These words appeared to cover the question of financialassistance, and. if the matter were referred to twiceit might be thought that there were two forms offinancial assistance, and misunderstanding would arise.The question was asked as to whether the last words of the sentence from paragraph 8 quoted above, viz.,&quot;and from the Jewish State&quot;, ought to stand.    ,as it-desirable to underline at this sta.ge the fact that theJewish State was to give a subsidy to the Arab State?The Secretary of State for the Colonies pointed, outthat this wa.s a very important matter from the pointof view of the Arabs .The following words in paragraph 8 were also dis-cus s ed : -&quot;Its nationals would acquire a statussimilar to that, enjoyed by the nationals of other countries&quot;.It was suggested that the inclusion of these wordswould, debar us from continuing the proposed jewish state under a Mandate if eventually that course should.appear desirable.The Secretary of State for the Colonies pointed outthat the Royal Commission had. made a great point of allowing the Jewish State to escape from the mandatoryposition.    He pointed out. that the Report contemplatedkeeping. Haifa, and the other three towns in the north ofPalestine under British control, a.t any rate for atime.    He thought it desirable to adhere to the report as long as possible, and. preferred not to omit the mention of this advantage from the point of view ofthe Zionis ts .
The Prime Minister pointed out that this part ofparagraph 8 had been included to set forth theadvantages of the Royal Commission&apos; 3 solution fromthe point of vie^&apos; of the Zionists.    If it should become necessary to adopt some new solution, thisparticular advantage would have to be omitted and fresh advantages would have to be stated.(Questions w^ere raised as to leakagesin regard to the Royal Commission sReport, as to the parlimentary debates and as to the broadcastingarrangements, which are dealt with ina separate Conclusion.)The Cabinet agreed  To approve the Statement of Policycontained in CP.-171 (37)  for publication as a White Paper simul-taneously with the Report of theRoyal Commission on the evening ofWednesday, July 7th, subject to thefo11ow ing ame ndments:-(a) In paragraphs 2 and 3, the refer-ences to Jews and. Arabs should begiven throughout in the alphabeticalorder &quot;Arabs and Jews&quot;:(b) The following words at the beginningof paragraph 7,&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment propose to advise His Majestyaccordingly&quot; should be inserted atthe end of paragraph 3:(c) In paragraph 4 the word &quot;therefore&quot;should be substituted for the word&quot;accordingly&quot;;(d) In paragraph 5, after the words inthe penultimate line &quot;Orders inCouncil&quot; insert a comma:.(e) Paragraph 6, line 1, the word &quot;or&quot;is a. misprint for &quot;of&quot;:(f) Paragraph 7, transfer, as already mentioned, the words  &quot;His Majesty&apos;sGovernment propose to advise HisMajesty accordingly&quot; to the end ofparagraph 3 and delete the remainder of the paragraph.
PALESTINEReport of theRoyal Commis-sion, 1936.(previous reference:Cabinet 28(3 7) , Con-clusion 1.)Leakages inthe Press.F.r. 2-.Par 1 i amen t ar yArrangements.Broad casting .Arrangements.(previous references:Cabinet 42(3 6) , Con-clusion 10.anfl Cabinet60 (33) , Con-clusion 5.)2, The attention of the &quot;-Cabinet was  called to-leakages that had taken place in certain Britishnewspapers, and. more particularly in an Americannewspaper (&quot;New York Times&quot;)  in regard to the Reportof the Royal Commission,    These leakages included, insome cases, the actual words of the Report of the RoyalCommission.- The Secretary of State for the Colonies had. little doubt that the leakages must have occurred in Palestine,where, as a. member of the Royal Commission had mentioned to him, owing to the nature of the adminis-trative machine such things were apt to occur.   He didnot propose to take any action in the present  case.In using the discretion given to him by the cabinet as to the issue of the Report he had. been ca.reful to confine it to Privy Counsellors, and had not evengiven a copy to Dr. /Veizmann.The question was raised, as to when the Debate was likely to take place in the House of Commons, asrepresentations had. been made to the Leader of theHouse of Lords asking that the Debate might be on thesame &amp;ay in both Houses.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that,no day had yet been fixed, but he thought the debate would probably take place on a Supply Day in thefollowing week.&quot;&quot;he Cabinet were reminded that when the Report ofthe Royal Commission was published it was probable thatthe Italians would broadcast their version throughoutthe Near East, and. it. was urged, that an accurate broad.-east should be issued, officially from some station inthe Near East.
The Secretary of State for the Colonies reportedthat the High Commissioner himself intended to broad-east on the Report from Jerusalem in English, and thatthis would be followed immediately by a broadcast oftranslations in Arabic and Hebrew.   The broadcast would reach Trans-Jordania, but the broadcasting station in Jerusalem would not reach as far as the Italianstation at Bari.   He then mentioned that the british broadcasting Corporation, without consultation withthe Colonial Office, had arranged for three broadcastsin regard to the Report:    the first by Lord Peel, theChairman of the Royal Commission, to which there was,of course, no objection:    the second by Mr NormanBentwich, a former Attorney-General in Palestine,from the Zionist point of view:    and the third byJamal Husseini,   the representative of the PalestineArab Committee.    In the two latter cases, andespecially in that of Jamal Husseini,     there wasgrave risk of starting an acute controversy from thefirs t.Objections v.-ere raised, against the action of theB.B.C in making their broadcasting arrangementswithout  consultation with His Majesty&apos;s Government,and the Cabinet were reminded of difficulties that had arisen in the past with the B .B .C . in this respect.In particular, on a matter which had. a most important bearing on international relations, such as thePalestine Report, it was essential that the utmostdiscretion should be used as to ^hat was broadcast.It was suggested that the B.B.C. should, be approached,either through the Chairman or Sir John Reith, and. askedto cut out the second and third, broadcasts.As a modification of this proposal it. was suggested,that, it might be explained to the ^.B.C. that later onthey would have opportunities for broadcasting talks-7-
on the two sides of the Royal Commission&apos;s1 Report,e.g., when the matter was debated, in Parliament, and.perhaps thereafter, but that it was most undesirable to stir up controversy on the first announcement, whenfrom a national point of view the great object was tosecure its acceptance by moderate opinion among bothjews and. Arabs-   Such controversy, the Cabinet were reminded, would he particularly undesirable from thepoint of view of the attitude of the. Kings of thevarious Arab States.Discussion took place as to the best  channel through which the B.B.C. should be approached:    e.g., the formal channel of a communication from the Postmaster-General to the Chairman, or a less formal approach bythe Secretary of State for the Colonies, whether inwriting or by personal communication,to the Chairmanor to Sir John Reith.The Secretary of State for the Colonies was not convinced that the broadcasts: would necessarily dovery much harm, but  expressed, willingness to take appropriate action.The Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary of State for the colonies should discuss with the r.ostma.st er-Generalthe best, method of approach to the british broadcasting Corporation with a view to a modification in their arrangements for broadcasting on the Palestine Report.
Agriculturalolicy.Long-Term MilkPolicy.previous reference:Cabinet 27(37), Con-clusion 7.)3.    The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries saidthat he had prepared plans for a long-term milk policy but required assistance in perfecting them.   Forexample, the Ministry of Health, the Board of Tradeand the Board of Education were all concerned.   Hewould therefore like to have the assistance of some ofhis  colleagues in drawing up a long-term agricultural policy .The Cabinet agreed  &quot;&quot;hat a Cabinet Committee,  composed as follows the Prime Minister,The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Lord Privy Seal,The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs,The Secretary of State for Scotland,The President of the Board of Trade,The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries,The President of the Board of Education,The Minister of Health  should be appointed to consider the long-term Agricultural Policy of the Governmentand to make recommendations .2* Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,July 5, 193 7,
