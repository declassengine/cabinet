1. The Prime Minister sai^ that he had received anote from the Postmaster-General to which was attached,a communication from the British broadcasting corporation-    It was clear to him that at the meeting referred to in the margin the Cabinet had not had allthe facts before them and some injustice had been done to the B.B.C.    The suggestion had been made that theB.B.C. had. arrange^ their broad.ea.sts without discussing the matter with the Colonial Office.    It appeared thatas long ago as May last,, when the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies was broadcasting on another subject,a lady employee of the BoBoCo had. mentioned to him thatthe Corporation were receiving requests for a broadcasting&quot;*easton Palestine.   He ha.d replied, that he hoped, there wouldbe no broadcast until the Palestine Report had been published.    The B.B.C. had  then approached variouspeople with a. view to arranging broadcasts after thepublication of the Royal Commission&apos;s Report. Eventuallythey had. approached the Colonial Office with theproposals referred to at the previous Meeting of theCabinet.    An official of the Colonial Office had thenobtained the approval of the Secretary of State to theproposed, broadcasting^ ea.sts .    In the circumstances he had. thought it desirable to inform his  colleagues of the facts in view of what had appeared in the Cabinetrecord, and. he thought it only right to make clear thatthe B.E.C. ought; not. to be blamed0So far as the future was  concerned, the B .B .C. were willing to. meet the wishes of the Government.   he proposed to tell them that, in view of the controversythat was likely to arise on the publication of theReport, the Government would prefer that no statement(apart from, that of the Chairman of the Royal commission should be broadcast, but that this was without prejudice
to the future, when it might be possible to agree tofurther broadcasts.    In any event the broadcasts now contemplated were not to take place until July 14th.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To take note of the satisfactoryexplanation given by the british broadcasting Corporation of thecircumstances in which they madethe arrangements referred to atthe previous Meeting of the cabinet for broad casting the Report of theRoyal Commission on Palestine:(b) That the British Broadcasting Corpor-ation should, be asked, in view ofthe controversy that was liable to arise on the publication of theReport of the Royal Commission on palestine, not at present to arrangeany controversial broadcasts, though this ws.s without prejudice to thefuture, when a different decision might be possible.
SPAIN,(previous reference:Cabinet 27(3 7) , Con-elusion 1.)PR. 30(57)1.Our Relationswith general franco.G-eneralFranco&apos;s -Relationsvith theDictatorPowers .2. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that the Spanish situation continued tangledand troubled.    General Franco&apos;e victory at Bilbao, and.still more the failure of the Spanish Government totake the offensive, increased the probability ofGeneral Franco&apos;s ultimate victory.   On the other hand,the Government were said, to have improved, theirdefences at Madrid and. to have reorganised their army.An early end to the conflict therefore appearedunlikely .Turning to the question of our relations with general franco, the Secretary of State said that on the onehand the Press articles and broadcasts from general franco&apos;s territory gave a better impression.   On theother hand General Franco was now standing out forbelligerent rights and. was likely to give us littlesatisfaction, in commercial matters, for example, whichin dealing with him, j   were now of some importance/ unless they were granted.While General Fra.nco would, try and. strike as good, abargain as he could, it was fairly clear that he didnot want to break with us .General Franco continued to maintain good relationswith the German Government, but his relations with italy had deteriorated..   Evidence was accumulating; that hewas willing to see the volunteers disappear,   -^hePortuguese Ambassador had assured the Secretary of Stateof this, and had even said that, he    thought he could obtain a statement from General Franco to this effect,possibly with permission to use it at the Meeting ofthe Non-intervention Committee on Friday.   He (theSecretary of State) ha.d replied, that it would, be useful to have such a statement but thai- it would, be advisable not to use it publicly yet.    The PortugueseAmbassador had repeated, the assurances of the desire
d 0 0fbe italian attitude.The german attitude.The french attitude.pie Non-fhterventionCommittee.of the Portuguese Government that Germany and italy should not dominate Spain.The Italian Ambassador, whom he had. seen recently,had adopted rather a stiff line on volunteers and had given no sign that the Italian Government would, agreeto their withdraws!. The only encouragement was a reference to the last paragraph of Signor Mussolini&apos;press article in which he suggested that the retentionor withdrawal of volunteers was rather a. matter forGeneral Franco.    Count Grandi had. indicated tha.t ithad not been easy for Italy to follow Germany&apos;s leadover the &quot;LEIPZIG&quot; incident.The Secretary of State at this point, read, a letterfrom Sir Eric Drummond. to Sir Robert Va.nsitta.rt, whichis quoted in the next Conclusion.The Secretary of State said that there were indica-tions that Germany did not want to commit herself anyfurther in Spain.   A breakdown of non-intervention would,therefore place her in a difficulty.In France there was considerable irritation over theGerman-Italian proposal.    They objected, to a dis crimina-tion which would maintain foreign observers on Frenchsoil, while withdrawing them from the ships of other powers.    There was increasing nervousness in France abou*the Italian ambitions in the Mediterranean.    The french would go on with non-intervention if the control schemewas reasonably fair and. volunteers were withdrawn from spain.   They said that they would not. give belligerentrights, but if these other conditions were satisfied it seemed possible that they might be persuaded.The present position of the Non-intervention committee was that a Plenary Meeting was to be held, onFriday next, when strong support would be elicited tothe Anglo-French scheme.   He thought, however, thatit would be wiser not to take a vote on the subject.
as it w?s undesirable to put the Germans and Italians,so to speak, in the dock.    It appeared possible that,when the dangers of the situation were realised, a.suggestion might be made that the Chairman of the Non-intervention Committee should be asked to propose a compromise.    In the interval before the Meeting theForeign Office would be at work on this difficult matter.In reply to the Prime Minister, the Secretary of methods of controlState said that the only alternative/ appeared to be either the Anglo-French proposal for filling the gap in the Naval patrol caused by the German and Italianwithdrawal, or the posting of officers in Spanishports. The Foreign Office preferred the former,because the latter would require so much negotiation with the Spanish Governments  concerned.In the course of a discussion which followed theSecretary of State&apos;s statement it appeared that a compromise might be sought on the lines ofa withdrawal of volunteers from both sides in Spain,combined with the grant of belligerent rights, and with or without the continuance of Naval control.    Thewithdrawal of volunteers, it was pointed out, might perhaps be arranged more easily, at any rate inGeneral Franco&apos;s  case, by securing their dismissalthan by their recall by the Governments .concerned.The withdrawal of the volunteers serving with theValencia Government, however, was recognised to presentconsiderable difficulties.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat he did not contemplate that belligerent rights would be granted until after the withdrawal of volunteers had begun.
A good deal of discussion took place as to whether,if belligerent rights were granted, it was or was not desirable to continue the Naval patrol.   On the onehand it was suggested that one of our objects in agreeing to belligerent rights was to escape from theburden of the Naval patrol.    It was pointed out,however, that an awkward situation would arise owingto there being two lists, namely, the list of contra-band. issued by General Franco and agreed by ourselves,and the list of articles whose export to Spain was prohibited under the control scheme.   On the other hand of belligerent rights was to secure the continuance ofthe non-intervention scheme:    but, in view of past experience, no-one would, have any confidence in thescheme unless the check provided, by the Naval patrolwas  continued, without which, therefore, its continu-ance would be jeopardised.It was recognised that there was much to be said for maintaining the non-intervention scheme, includingthe Naval patrol if necessary, in being, in order tosupport a facade of international agreement .The Cabinet agreed -That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should be authorised to work forthe withdrawal of volunteers from Spain,the granting of belligerent rights to both&quot;contending parties in Spain, andthe maintenance of the Naval patrolif it could, be arranged.it was pointed outof the grant
3m n0 03. In the course of the discussion summarised in thepreceding Conclusion the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs read to his  colleagues a confidential and veryprivate letter which the Permanent Under-Seeretary ofState for Foreign Affairs had received from His Majesty*ambassador in Rome.    (Copy on record in the Cabinet-Office.)It was mentioned that the Permanent Under-Secretaryof State had communicated a copy of the letterconfidentially to the Chiefs of Staff of the defence services.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence raised the question as to how far the letter ought to betreated, as a warning from the point of view of ourdefens ive arrangement, s .The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointedout that no action was called for in the letter sentto the Chiefs of Staff.The Prime Minister thought that there was very littlethat could be done to improve matters.   The real counter to Italy&apos;s disquieting attitude was to get on better terms with Germany.The Lord President of the Council urged that, incarrying out the Prime Minister&apos;s idea of betteringrelations with Germany we should (for example, inconnection with the Spanish situation) avoid putting forward our suggestions as Angle-French proposals, andthat close contact should be preserved with Berlinin the development of such proposals.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed in these proposals.    If the Chairman of the Non-intervention Committee were asked for proposals, these would not bear the chara,cter of Anglo-French proposals.
and he had already instructed His Majesty&apos;s ambassador at Berlin to see Baron von Neurath on the subject.The Cabinet agreed in the Prime Minister&apos;proposal that the best way of counteringthe disquieting attitude of the ItalianGovernment was to cultivate better relations with the German Government.-8-
SPAIN.Protection ofBritish Ship-ping.(previous reference:Cabinet 19(37), Con-conclusion ion 2.)4. The First Lord of the Admiralty, in reply toa question, said that the Senior Naval Officer on theNorth Coast of Spain had warned British ships not toe nt e r S ant and e r .The President of the Board of Trade said that theform of the warning was a matter of some importance.Anything in the nature of a formal warning reactedon insurance and was liable to raise difficulties.The Board of Trade preferred, so far as possible, togive the warning in the form of an objective statementof the facts, showing the risks that would be run by ships entering a dangerous area.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat this was the better method also from the pointof view of the Foreign Office.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that instruc-tions had. already been sent to the Senior Naval Officerabout the form of wa.rning.The Cabinet agreed  That the most appropriate method, of warning, shipping was, where practicable,to issue an objective statement of the dangers involved, in entering or leavingparticular areas.
5*     The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs said that his colleagues would,, no doubt, have seen the Report of an interview with General Hertzog onthe subject of the South African Protectorates0The interview contained many inaccuracies a.     Theepisode was unfortunate and was liable to cause verygreat difficulties0      It was somewhat difficult tounderstand the reasons, but this was not the first occasion on which General Hertzog had been betrayedby his bad memory or taken impulsive action in thismattersThe Secretary of State reminded bheCabinet that, by the South Africa Act, 192.9,.we were pledged to transfer the territories inquestion some day, but we were also pledged not to doso until the inhabitants of the territories had had anopportunity to express their view?     General Hertzoghad always recognised this and we could not hand overthe territories to the Union unless this was acceptable to the inhabitants.,      In 1935 an agreement had been reached on the subject between backward J4H. thomas and General Hertzog from which he read the following extract to the Cabinets-&quot;The conclusion which we draw from theabove considerations is that the policyof both Governments for the next fewyears should be directed to bringing about a situation in which, if transferwere to become a matter of practical politics, it could be effected with thefull acquiescence of the populationsconcerned,.     With this end in view we feel it important that the closest possible co-operation should be established between the Union Government and theAdministrations of the Territories,     Werealise, of course, that some measureof co-operation already exists;   but we feel that there are many directions inwhich it could be fruitfully extended.In particular it appears to us to be anessential condition of the success of ^ucha policy that the native population ^should feel that the Union Government are working
in concert with the local Administrationswith a real and generous desire to develop and improve conditions in the Territories,,M(Gmd.  4948/1935)As the result of this Agreement we had hoped for a few years of co-operation in connection with these territories and that policy had started wellv      ThenGeneral Hertzog had made an unexpected and awkwardstatement in the South African Parliament and had suggested that we had undertaken to hand over Swazilandin two year*s time and Bechuanaland and Basutoland soon after.      That had upset the good start made inco-operationo     The Secretary of State had then got intouch with General Hertzog through the British HighCommissioner and had secured his agreement to a statement which he (the Secretary of State) had made in Parliamentto correct the situations      Then General Hertzog had come to London.      He had spoken to the prime minister on the subject of Protectorates and had two longconversations with the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs.     Mr0 Havenga had been present at the  secondconversation e       General Hertzog had pressed for an early.transfer of the Protectorates0      The Secretary of state had pointed out that although he favoured transferultimately, native opinion was at present strongly opposed and we were bound by our pledges;   we should haveto endeavour to create conditions in which theinhabitants would, become more friendly to the transfer.In the meanwhile, we ought to pursue the policy ofco-operation laid down in the Thomas-Hertzog Agreement.General Hertzog had been very disappointed with theresult of these conversations and was angered by a debate which had taken place in the House of Lords whenmuch opposition had been raised to the transfer of the territories in question,     Nevertheless, he had gone away with a clear agreement that the next step should be for
the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to write him a letter (which was to take the form, in the firstinstance, of a draft letter for his consideration and suggestions) setting forth the policy of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom.     Both General Hertzogand Mr. Havenga had agreed to that procedure.     TheSecretary of State had assumed that until that procedurehad been followed, no public statements would be made on either side.      He had had other talks with General Hertzogin order to resolve other difficulties, but the general had never reverted to this question.      In fact, at themoment of his departure, General Hertzog had not mentioned the fact that he had already given an interview to Reuter&apos;sAgency expressing his disappointment on this subject andthreatening that if the United Kingdom Government did notchange its attitude there might be unpleasant consequences.The Secretary of State had seen Mr. Havenga about thisinterview and the latter had felt sure that the General musthave been misrepresented, but unfortunately this was not thecase.     Mr. Havenga had obviously been disturbed at thisepisode and had shown clearly that he had hoped that no statement would be made on either side.On landing in South Africa, General Hertzog had made a short statement on the subject of the Protectorates,foreshadowing a further statement to be made in Pretoriaafter he had established contact with the Cabinet.     Onhearing of the Capetown statement,  the Secretary of state had sent a message to be delivered to General Hertzog atPretoria reminding him of their agreement about procedure,and suggesting the postponement of any fuller statementuntil they had exchanged the promised communications.Unfortunately, however, General Hertzog had spoken atBloemfontein before reaching Pretoria.The Secretary of State then gave particulars ofsome of the inaccuracies contained in General Hertzog&apos;sstatement. no
it&quot; ai&amp;a^ &quot;/Lai&quot;iU 6Sj - /j/-^A-cX.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs\said he would have to make a statement in the House ofCommoris^&amp;aaa-do his best to pour oil on troubled waters.It was important to try and straighten this matter outbefore the Union Parliament met, which was fortunatelynot until next january      The fundamental difficulty/ was the difference between the native policy of HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and that ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government in the Union of South Africa,which was probably not so serious as it was sometimesrepresented to be and was shared, to some extentt in southern Rhodesia and by the white inhabitants .;f thecentral African colonies0The Prime Minister thanked the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs who, he pointed out, had notthe smallest responsibility for the difficulty that had arisen.
6.   The Cabinet again had under consideration theJoint Memorandum by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs and the First Lord of the Admiralty&apos;C.P.-162 (37)) on the subject of Ratification of theLondon Naval Treaty, 1936.The Prime   Minister reported that he had seen the Leaders of the Labour and Liberal opposition parties in Parliament with a view to obtainingagreement for the ratification of the Treaty withouteither legislation or a resolution by Parliament forwhich Parliamentary time was not   available,,       the leader of the Labour Opposition, after consultingMr. Alexander, had intimated that the ratificationwithout previous discussion in the House of commons would set an undesirable pre-jo dent to which he could not    I agree.      The Bill, of courset was required by the Govern- IIment not to enable ratification to take place but forthe purpose.of carrying out the Treaty?      He had discussed&apos;;the matter with the Parliamentary Secretary to theTreasury and now proposed that the latter should approach the Opposition Parties with a view to their giving up partof a Supply Day to enable the Bill to be discussed.That the Prime Minister should arrangefor an approach to be made to theLeaders of the Labour and LiberalOpposition Parties in Parliament with aview to the surrender of part of a SupplyDay in order that the London naval treaty Bill may be1 discsussed.

A Summary of tRecommendations of thereproduced as an Appendfor Co-ordination7))   covering theee of the Committeeup in pursuancementioned in the he Conclusions and sub-Committee isix to these Minutes:A Memorandum by the Home Secretary (CP.-176(37))   commenting on the recommendations contained in the Report attached to CP.-172(37):  asking that the Departments  concerned,should be authorised to enter without delayinto negotiations with local authorities on the financial aspects of air raidprecautions on the lines suggested, in his memorandum;    and pointing out the desira-bility of some announcement of policy beingmade in the near future:A Joint Memorandum by the President of theBoard of Education and the Secretary ofState for Scotland (CP.-167 (37))  covering a draft Circular to Local Authorities on air Raid Precautions in Schools;    consideration-tion of which had been reserved at thesecond Meeting mentioned, in the margin.The Home Secretary made a statement on thesubject to the Cabinet, at the end of which he said thathe was not asking for approval to any particularfigures of expenditure.     What was essential was thathe should have authority to start negotiations with local authorities at once.     The present situation wasa very awkward one, since negotiations had begun twoyears ago and some authorities had started to carry out their schemes,   but nothing had been settled on thequestion of expenditure.     He asked, therefore, for authority to invite representatives of five or sixmunicipal associations to meet him*     As thenegotiations might take some time, he proposed that
Q r!  didthey should &quot;be kept as informal as possible at the fitrtst stage-and that he should ask i.the representatives of local authorities to considerthe matter and prepare their schemes.     So far as thefinance was concerned, he would like to propose a50:50 basis as the starting point for negotiations.It was not likely that it could be possible to secure agreement on that basis but the officials of theMinistry of Health and Home Office agreed that it wasthe right starting point.     He would be careful toavoid any pledges on the actual amount of expenditure involved,,The Chancellor of the Exchequer said hehad had a long talk with the Home Secretary and other colleagues on the subject and he thought that whstwas now proposed by the Home Secretary was right.The question cf the ultimate expenditure would have topostponed until he had obtained the general survey ofDefence Programmes of which Air Raid Precautions formed a parts      (See Cabinet 27 (37) Conclusion 2.)     Hisunderstanding was that no decision was asked for as to amount;    and that the Home Secretary wanted to see theprincipal local authorities.     So long as it was plain that there was no commitment as to the amount of moneyto be found, he thought it was right that the localauthorities should be seen.     He understood also thatthe Home Secretary would start negotiations on expenditure on the 50:50 basis and that he would not go beyond a 60:40 basis without coming back to theCabinet.     He believed that a proposal had been madefor varying the percentage to be paid by the State andthe local authorities respectively in different branchesof the Air Raid Precautions Services.     The Treasurypreferred a standard percentage.     He believed also
that the country was to he divided into zones accordingto the degree of risk to which they were exposed.     he presumed that the amounts of expenditure and therefore theamounts of the grants would be affected by the zone inwhich the local authority concerned was situated and thatthis factor would be taken into account in thenegotiations.The Home Secretary thought it might benecessary to vary the ratio in some particular services such as the provision of fire brigade appliances, but hethought this might be left to be settled by theGhancellor of the Exchequer and himself*The Secretary of State for War was anxious that expenditure on Air Raid Precautions should, where possible, inure to the permanent good of the country0He gave underground garages as an exampleoThe Minister of Health, while agreeing thatthe proposed conversations with local authorities oughtto take place as soon as possible, pointed out that theposition of some of the poorer local authorities would present difficulties.     He understood that no general approval of Sir Warren Fisherrs Sub-Committee on air raid Precautions Services was sought at the moment.There were various matters in that report that requiredvery careful consideration, and he thought that afterthe Home Secretary&apos;s negotiations had made some progress,it might be necessary to consider how high we were to aim at in carrying out Air Raid Precautions Services,The Minister for Co-Ordination of Defence drew attention to two matters connected with Air RaidPrecautions:    first. Sir Richard Hopkins Sub-Committee onProtection of Vital Services, and,second, the plans forthe evacuation of London.     In view of the astronomical
figures in expenditure involved in Air Raid Precautions,there was a good.deal to he said for evacuation, if it were practicable.       In any event, he thought the cabinet ought to be chary of expenditure on preparations in small towns and villages even in the more exposed zones.Our efforts ought to be concentrated on London and themore important industrial areas,A suggestion was made that fire brigades oughtto receive a large measure of priority in view of thealarming character of the fire problem,The Secretary of State for Air urged that ministers and officials should avoid giving figures to the local authorities which were likely to createalarm;   and despondency3The Cabinet agreed:(a)    That the Home Secretary should beauthorised to enter without delayinto negotiations with lodalauthorities on the lines suggestedin his memorandum;    that on thefinance aspects he should start witha    proposal on the basis of 50:50by the Government and local authoritiesrespectively;    and that he should not go beyond a basis of 60:40 without aCabinet decision..     He should avoid giving any indication of any figureof expenditure contemplated by theGovernment.   Details, e.g. as tothe variation of the ratio of grants to expenditure on particular services or ofthe rate of expenditure on particularzones should be settled by the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the Home Secretary:(&quot;b)     That the Home Secretary should at theappropriate moment arrange for anunostentatious announcement in theHouse of Commons that he was in touchwith the local authorities on thesubject!
That the issue of the draft circular toLocal Authorities on. Air Raid Precautionsin Schools submitted with the joint memorandum by the President of the Board ofEducation and the Secretary of State forScotland (CP. 167 (37)) should not be made until some progress had been made with thediscussions with local authorities.- 19 t
RETIRED GOVERN-MENT SERVANTS:EMPLOYMENT WITHBUSINESS CON-CERNfi.* (previous reference:Cabinet 19(37), Con-clusion 7,)8.Arising out of the Report of the RoyalCommission on the Private Manufacture of and trading in Arms (Cmd.5292 of 193 6, paragraphs 109and 110), the Cabinet had before them a Note by thePrime Minister ^CoP.-173 (37))   circulating for theconsideration of his colleagues  copies of a minute by Sir Warren Pisher giving the results of inter-Service consideration of the question of acceptanceof employment with business  concerns by retiredGovernment Servants,  civil and military.   Attachedto the Minute were the draft of a White Paper,prepared with a view to informing Parliament of the outcome of the investigation into the problem, andan Appendix indicating the principles which shouldregulate the conduct of Civil Servants in theirrelation to the public.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence saidthat he anticipated that his Vote might be put down for discussion by the House of Commons on Fridaynext, July 9th.    It would perhaps be convenient ifthis White Paper could be issued before the Debate.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the Minute by Sir VarrenFisher containing the results of inter-Service consideration of the questionof acceptance of employment in businessconcerns by retired Government Servants,civil and military:(b) That, the draft White Paper attached, tothe Minute should, be issued, as soon aspossible.Later information is that the Vote in question willnot be discussed on July 9th.

APPENDIX.:COMMITTEE  OF IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.Sub-Committee on Air Raid Precautions Services.Conclusions and Recommendations.33. Our Conclusions and recommendations may be summarised asfollows : (a) That as regards the nature, scale and distribution of Air Raid PrecautionsServices, including hospital and fire brigade services (1) The aim of Air Raid Precautions is (a) To maintain the morale of the people;(b) To ensure the continued functioning of the activities which are vital tothe effective prosecution of the war and to the life of the community;(c) To reduce to a minimum the destruction of life and property likely to beproduced by air raids(paragraph 5).(2) We take the view that passive defence measures must be considered partpassu and correlated with all the other war activities of the country as a whole,in order that due weight may be given to the order of priority which should be accorded to our various defence measures. In this connection we have beeninformed that the man-power requirements for air raid precautions have been estimated at 1,398,500 (cf which less than 200,000 need to be men of under40 years of age), and that these requirements are being considered by the ManPower Sub-Committee, with a view to adjusting the balance between them andthe claims of active defence and of industry (paragraphs 6, 7 and 19).(3) We have proceeded on the estimate of the Air Staff that the scale of enemy attack may be over 600 tons of bombs per diem. While it is arguable thatthis scale of attack may not be sustainable for a long period against such of our most Vulnerable centres as are provided with the strongest defences, it must beremembered that the volume of attack in the early weeks of war may be far greaterthan this figure, and it is essential that the scale of air raid precautions shouldbe sufficient to ensure against the collapse of morale or of vital services in the initial period, when the attack is likely to be at its heaviest (paragraphs 8-10).(4) We consider that the problem of the evacuation of the population,especially from the London area, at the onset of emergency has an important bearing not only on air raid precautions but also on other war preparations.We are advised that the problem is under intensive consideration by the Air RaidPrecautions Department (paragraph 11).(5) The general scheme of air raid precautions should be based on some suchprinciple of grading of risks as has already been prepared by the Air RaidPrecautions Department, taking into account the comparative liability oflocalities to attack and their comparative value as targets (paragraphs 15 and 16).(6) We recommend that the proposals set out in Classes A &quot; to &quot;E &quot; inPart III of the Home Office Memorandum of the 23rd March, 1937, on theFinancial Aspects of Air Raid Precautions (Paper No. D.P.R. 181) and repro-duced as Appendix I, should be accepted in principle as representing the scale of effort involved in the present Deficiency Programme of the Air Raid Precau-tions Department. The total expenditure under these heads, to be met fromExchequer and/or local government funds, is estimated at  12,725,000 capitalplus  1,300,000 annually (paragraph 17 and Footnote on page 6).[15492-1]
(7) We have not dealt with the following additional measures of Air RaidPrecautions Services : (i) Base Hospitals.(ii) Vital Services (Electricity, Water, Gas, &amp;c).(iii) Protection against the effects of blast and splinters from high explosive bombs.(iv) Structural alterations to buildings. (paragraph 20.)(i) Base Hospitals.We consider that the Base Hospital problem should be treated on a national basis and we recommend that the measures necessary for the treatment of civilianair casualties in Base Hospitals should be re-examined on the arbitrary basis ofa present estimated deficiency of 87,000 beds for which the necessary buildingsalready exist; and that requirements in excess of these should be met by a schemeof improvisation. At our request a special Sub-Committee has been set up bythe Minister for Co-ordination of Defence for this purpose (paragraph 20 (i)).(ii) Vital Services [Electricity, Water, Gas, &amp;c).A special Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence has been setup to consider this problem. The provisional estimate of cost to the Exchequergiven in Paper No. D.P.R. 181 was  5 million (paragraph 20 (ii)).(iii) Protection against the effects of Blast and Splinters from high explosive bombs.The Defence Policy and Requirements Committee at their Meeting held onthe 24th June agreed that the accumulation of the proposed reserve of 500 millionsandbags should be spread over a period of six years and authorised, as an interim measure, the purchase of a six months&apos; quota of sandbags on this basis, i.e.,42 million approximately, or such lesser quantity as the industry could provide in the normal course. The estimated cost of providing the complete reserve of500 million sandbags is  5 million (paragraph 20 (iii)).(iv) Structural alterations to buildings.We consider that the proposals for the structural alteration of new dwellingsin public housing schemes, at the estimated cost of  60 per house, must be subordinated to the primary consideration that these houses should be available ata reasonable rent, and we therefore recommend that no public announcement should be made regarding such structural alterations, though advice and encouragement should be given to those willing to make such provision at theirown expense (paragraph 20 (iv)).(b) That as regards the distribution of responsibility between Central and LocalAuthorities and voluntary organisations r-(8) The Ministerial responsibility for the control and organisation of air raid Precaution Services should continue to rest with the Home Secretary in timeof peace (paragraph 27).(9) The scope of the responsibilities of the Central and the Local Authoritiesrespectively should be defined in the manner suggested in Appendix II to thisReport, subject to any necessary adjustments with regard to emergency fire brigade measures (paragraphs 21-23).(10) In time of peace work in connection with the preparation of localschemes must primarily be the responsibility of Local Authorities, subject toadvice and guidance by the Home Office organisation. Legislation defining thepowers and duties of the Central and Local Authorities, and authorisingexpenditure on these schemes, will be necessary (paragraph 21).(11) These local schemes should be subject to examination by the Centralauthority on the basis of the general principles referred to in paragraph 15 above,and Exchequer grants should be made in aid of such schemes only so far as theyare approved by the Central authority (paragraphs 22 and 25).(12) We consider that the services of voluntary organisations might be usefully enlisted in aid of Air Raid Precautions, provided that suchorganisations (i) act in close co-operation with, but under, the local authorities;(ii) in no way detract from the proper responsibilities of local authorities as already defined;
kind 382(iii) are financially self-supporting; and(iv) are non-political and embrace every section of the community.This matter is now being considered by the Home Secretary (paragraph 26).(c) That as regards the necessary adjustment of present Departmental responsi-bility and organisation resulting from the growth and development ofAir Raid Precautions (13) It will be necessary to establish a system of co-ordination which will ensure not only the translation of decided policy into action upon an agreed and concerted plan of administration, but also, as an essential pre-requisite, agreement on policy itself, and on any public announcement in connection therewith. Wetherefore recommend (i) that questions of major policy, as well as of appeals on policy resultingfrom Departmental differences of opinion, should be referred to theSub-Committee on Defence Policy and Requirements, all ministers concerned attending as Members of that Committee with the object of representing the views of their respective Departments.(ii) that, in addition to the normal methods of consultation, co-co-ordination between the various Departments in time of peace should be faciliated by a Joint Standing Inter-Departmental Committee, and that theMembers of this Committee should be of sufficient rank to ensureexecutive effect being given to decided policy. This Committee will include members from all the Departments concerned in, or affected by air raid precautions, and from the Committee of Imperial Defence,which will, in addition, provide a Joint Secretary(paragraphs 28 and 29).. (14) We recommend that financial provision from the Exchequer for air raid Precautions Services in England and Wales, including provision for fire brigade services, should be shown in a single Air Raid Precautions Vote, subject,however, to the following reservations : (i) Expenditure on buildings and stationery provided by the Office of works and the Stationery Office will be borne on the Votes of those Depart-ments, particulars of such expenditure being given in the usual state-ment as to Allied Services.(ii) Expenditure attributable to Air Raid Precautions, e.g., in respect of schools or Police buildings, which would qualify for grant under analready existing scheme, should be included in the Estimates of theDepartment or Service concerned (paragraph 30).(15) We have given special consideration to the particular case of Air RaidPrecautions Services in Scotland, and our recommendations under this headingwill be found above in paragraph 31 of the main body of the Report.(16) In time of war it will be necessary for the Central Authority to assumed greater measure of control, and it may well prove necessary to place the air raid Precautions Department under a special Minister (paragraph 32).(17) We recommend, in the light of the growth and development of Air RaidPrecautions, and of the additional responsibilities and work which will fall onthe Central Authority charged with the general direction and supervision ofwork throughout the country, that the Air Raid Precautions Department shouldbe substantially strengthened and that arrangements should be made for theinstitution of regional staffs throughout the country (paragraph 32).
