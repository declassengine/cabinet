SELGTUM. 1. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,e Five-Power       reporting briefly on his visit to Brussels, said thatnf erence.  his conversat iors had. been useful.    The Belgianlease fromdertaking Government were clearly relieved at their releaseMar eh,$6. from obligations to the French, and had been moste Foreign cordial anc1 anxious to cultivate the best possiblecretary ssit to. relations with this  country.    In his  conversationshe had referred to the Five-Power negotiations,previous reference: M. Van Zeeland had shown himself -a^the^ favourableabinet 1837), Con- to the idea, of a series of Belgian non-aggreseion&quot;us ion 1.)pacts a.ccompanied. by declarations.    The matter hadbeen left that M^-Van^-c^and^era to discuss theproposal with the French as a first step towardslater discussions with Germany and Italy.    On economic matters M. Van Zeeland had refused  to disclose hisimpressions until he had. collected further informa-tion.   He had been impressed by Br. Schacht&apos;s taleof Germany&apos;s economic difficulties;    also by acertain lessening in the respect shown by Dr.Schachttowards high authorities in Germany   symptoms of. which, the Foreign Secretary observed, had. beennoticeable elsewhere.   M. Van Zeeland also reportedbad economic conditions in Italy as well as in Germary,and had formed, the impression that Germany really didwant some kind of economic arrangement.    In order toi     complete his enquiries, M. Van Zeeland was going to visit the United States of America, and proposed totell the Germans that oh his return he would have something more to say.   The Foreign Secretary had.invited. M. Van Zeeland to  call at London on his wayback from Washington, and. he had accepted.   At present,as he had. said, M. Van Zeeland was not prepared to- make a forecast of what could, be done, but he had
observed, a better attitude on the part of Governmentsgenerally,  and less rigidity than existed six months ago.    The Foreign Secretary ad^ed. that he would, becirculating fuller reports of his  conversations indue course.
SPAIN. 3. The Cabinet had before then a Note by theSituation on First Lord of the Admiralty f CP.-122 (37))   covering the North &quot; .boast of. an Admiralty appreciation of the situation on theNorth Coast of Spain.   No change of policy was(previous reference: suggested in present  conditions, but the First LordCabinet 18,(37), Con- said that it must be realised that the situationelusion 2.)placed a very heavy responsibility upon the men onJETLIO^R^NTEIGHTS.  &quot; spot, and that, try as best they might to avoidPrevious a ^angerous incident might take place at any reference:Cabinet 16 moment.(3 7) , Con-clusion 2.) The First Lord of the Admiralty said, that he hadfT/? 7io (yj) i  \/(      circulated, the Memorandum not with the idea of&quot;reopening the question of the policy, but to acquaintthe cabinet with the difficulties of the Admiralty andof the Naval Officers off the Spanish coast.Generally matters had gone more or less as had been anticipated.    Any grave incident had. fortunately been avoided, and. British ships making for Spanish portshad been protected.    It was, however, impossible to escape from the actual fact that we had broken general franco&apos;s blockade.    Naval Officers who had recentlyreturned, reported that if our warships had not been present British merchant ships would not have beenable to enter.   No foreign ships had. entered Bilbao,and British ships only because the Navy was present:in other words , but for our naval action the blockadewould be effective.During the night the Foreign Office had communi-cated by telephone with the Admiralty to say thatHis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Hendaye had. reported, a friendly overture from General Franco, and they hoped that any incident coul^ be avoided, while this&apos;fi was under consideration.    That had put the Admiralty&apos;and the Senior Naval Officer off the coast.of Spain
in a difficulty.    It had. been surmounted for themoment by the Senior Naval Officer informing theBritish ships about to leave St. Jean de Luz thathe was not ready to afford protection today. A numberof points of detail would arise, and the First Lordasked that a meeting of the Cabinet. Committee might-be held the same afternoon.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs then read to the Cabinet two telegrams, Nos .122 and 123,which had arrived, from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador .during the night.   No. 122 contained, a message fromthe Commercial Secretary, who had met the Presidentof General Franco&apos;s Commission of Industry and commerce at San Sebastian^ and. reported that thelatter&apos;s attitude had ^een extraordinarily concilia-tory.    After reporting his helpful attitude on anumber of points of detail, the Commercial Secretaryexpressed the view that the reason might be the realisation by the Insurgents of their dependenceupon the United Kingdom for foreign exchange.No. 123 contained a statement that, in view of thepresent unexpected friendly attitude of the insurgentauthorities, he had. arranged, with the Rear-Admiral to delay the sailing that, night for Bilbao of the three british ships now at St. Jean de Luz.   The Ambassadoralso stated that he was  concerned as to the lamentableimpression which would be  created if the much-advert isrelief ship financed by Mr Lloyd. George an&apos;&apos; Mr Maxtonreached. Bilbao under the protection of the Royal Navyup to the three-mile limit.The President of the Board of Trade said that thelatest offer from General Franco, reported in the 0Ambassador&apos;s telegram, was much wider than hitherto.
The Lord. Privy Seal opened up the question as towhether an initiative could not now be taken with aview to inducing Prance,  Italy and. Germany to  join usin an approach to both belligerents in Spain, in orderto bring about some kind of settlement.    In all thesecountries there appeared to be  considerable forcesdesirous of a settlement, and in Spain itself theGovernment side appeared to be more moderate than itwas, while General Franco&apos;s sympathisers appeared to doubt whether he was the man to achieve the ultimatesettlement,The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat he had. this matter very much in mind.   He hadeven taken some preliminary soundings.    If the UnitedKingdom, France,  Italy and Germany could agree, hethought the right  course would be to ask. for an armistice.    There was, however, the risk that, as theItalian Government believed that the war was goingwell for General Franco, they might not agree to any steps.Turning   then   to present difficulties, he said there were only two possible courses for the BritishGovernment:    first, to continue to protect our shipsup to the three-mile limit;    and, second, to accordbelligerent rights.   He had had the latter questionexamined again in the Foreign Office.    The grant of belligerent, rights would surmount some of our immediate difficulties only to involve us in others, p^obabAgranted, our ships could be stopped on the high seas,taken into Spanish ports for search, and. all commercea difficult Parliamentary situation would be created.If belligerent rights werewith Spain would come to an end.    If we did it aloneHe had learned, however, that some of the ScandinavianStates were anxious about the position.   He had
therefore asked the Earl of Plymouth to get thesubject discussed at the non-intervention Committee,He thought that the right line for the Earl ofPlymouth to take at the Committee would be that theBritish Government&apos;s policy was to continue non-intervention, but it would be useful to elicit theviews of others.Discussion at the Non-intervention Committee wasfavoured.    It was realised that if one side wasstronger than the other at sea, the conferring of belligerent rights would, give that side a great advantage, and this would be difficult to defend inParliament.    The discussion at the Non-intervention committee would be an opportunity to make our policyclear to the world, and particularly to States likeGermany, which were reported not fully to understand, itA suggestion was made that this action should, be supplemented, by a message to General Franco with the aim of avoiding an incident.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that theopinion of Naval Officers was that mine-laying byGeneral Franco1s forces would be stimulated by recent events.   He sai^ that the specially chartered foodship was due off Bilbao today.The Lord President of the Council was anxious that we should not reverse the present position offthe Spanish coast.   His information was that withinthe la^t day or two the prospects of peace had.somewhat improved.   He therefore favoured a peaceeffort .   It might be that the making of peace, as theForeign Secretary had said, would, take time&apos;    but once a peace movement had. got started it would be easier to change our policy on the Spanish coast.^he President o^ the Board, of Trade hope^ that our policy towards the protect ion of shipping would, notbe changed, at the moment.
The Cabinet agreed  (a) That there should he no change inthe Government&apos;a policy towards theprotection of British shipping asset forth in the Conclusion referred,to in the margin (paragraph (a)),namely, to afford, protection to british shipping on the high seas , but not in territorial waters:(b) That the Cabinet Committee on theProtection of British Shipping should meet the same afternoon to considervarious questions on which the FirstLord, of the Admiralty desired, to consult them:( c) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should, send, as soon as possible a telegram containing a message designedto avert as far as possible the risk ofa Naval incident off the Spanish coast.It might be pointed out in the messagethat it was impossible for us to alterour announced policy of securing the safety of British shipping up to theedge of the three-mile limit, and. itappeared, from such experience as was available, that General Franco&apos;s ships were unable (whether owing to the actionof the coast defences or the fear of mines)  to stop the entry of ships toports once they had reached the three-mile limit.   Would it not be advisable,therefore., for General Franco to instructhis ships to avoid, the vicinity of these ports when British ships were entering,and thus to escape humiliation and. reducethe risk of an incident?(d) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should, encourage a discussion atthe Non-intervention Committee on thepresent position, and. that the british representative should, make there a full statement of our altitude.    The oppor-tunity should be taken to ascertain theviews o-r other nations necessary onsuch questions as the grant of belligerentrights:( e)  That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should be authorised to take such action and at such time as he might deem desirable with a view to a jointeffort by the Powers  concerned in thedirection of an armistice as a preliminary to peace in Spain.
PALESTINE.ImmigrationLabourS chedule.(previous reference:Cabinet 11(3 7), Con-clusion 4.)F.H.Zl(5])b-.3 . In pursuance of the Conclusion mentioned inthe margin, the Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for the Colonies (CP.-113(37)) stating that, as the Report of the RoyalCommission on Palestine cannot now be expected beforethe middle of May, the High Commissioner had recom-mended. that the issue of the usual six months&apos;Immigration Labour Schedule should not be postponed.In these circumstances the Secretary of state proposed to make no statement in the House ofCommons, but merely to  concur XV ITH the High Commis-sioner&apos;s recommendation, and to suggest that thelatter should, invite the Jewish Agency to submit their application for labour certificates.   He added, thatthe representatives of the Jewish Agency in Londonwoul^ be informed,  confidentially of the changed circumstances and of the course now proposed to betaken.^he Secretary of State for the Colonies reportedthat the Chairman of the Royal Commission was indis-posed and likely to be laid up for a fortnight.   he understood that the earliest date for the completionof the Royal Commission&apos;a Report, therefore, was likely to be early in June.    This reinforced, thearguments in favour of the issue of an ImmigrationLabour Schedule.   He read to the Cabinet a telegram,dated 26th April, from the High Commissioner, statingthat after consideration in the Executive. Council hewas prepared, subject to the Secretary of State&apos;sdirections, to approve a Labour Schedule of 770certificates for the half-year ending 30th September.In the course of discuss ion it transpired that no announcement had been made in Parliament of the&apos;Cabinet&apos;s decision at the Meeting referred to in the margin, not to issue a Schedule at present;    but, as
a month had elapsed since the proper date for theissue of the Schedule, the fact of the delay was known.A suggestion was made that a further postponement of the issue of a Schedule would be no more difficultto defend, in view of the delay in the Royal Commis-sion&apos;s Report, than would the Schedule submitted bythe High Commissioner, the figures of which would beregarded in some quarters as derisory. ,On the other hand, the Cabinet were reminded that even after they had received the Report of the RoyalCommission some time would be required for reaching adecision, and the issue of a Labour Schedule couldnot be held up indefinitely.After some discussion the Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary of State for theColonies should be authorised to ask the High Commissioner to fix a newfigure, to cover four months insteadof six months .
4.    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for the Colonies (CP.-119(37)) inviting his colleagues to approve proposalsfor setting up a Colonial Empire Marketing Board,contained, in Reports of an Inter-DepartmentalCommittee attached, as Appendices III and. TV to his memorandum;    the necessary financial provision forthe Board&apos;s functions, which would, probably be of theorder of  52,000 a year when the full scheme came into operation;    and. legislation for the amendment ofthe Colonial Development Act for purposes indicatedin Appendix I to the Memorandum.The Cabinet agreed:To approve in principle the proposalsof the Secretary of State for theColonies as set forth in his memorandum cp. 119 (37) for setting up a colonial Empire Marketing Board, subjectto agreement between the Secretary ofState for the Colonies and theGhancellor of the Exchequer on certaindetails.
5o   The Cabinet had before them the following documents on the subject of the Organisation, armament and. Equipment of the Army, the first two of which hadreceived  consideration at the Meeting mentioned in the margin:-A Report by the Chiefs of StaffSub-Committee (CP.-41 (37)):^(yjj14&apos;- A. Memorandum by the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence (CP.-46(37)):A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for .Var (CP.-115 (37)),furnished, in accordance with conclusion 14 of Cabinet 5 (37),in which he asked the Cabinet to confirm the three decisions takenby them on February 3 , 193 7, assummed, up in paragraph 16 of his memorandum, and to agree that steps should be taken to implement those decisions on the basis of theestimates given in the Appendicesto hi? Memorandum;    together with proposals embodied, in the Conclu-sions set forth below.The Secretary of State for War said thatthe role of the Regular Army was not in dispute butdifficulties arose in connection with the^TerritorialArmy,     At present, the War Office were/Mmi^e^-to?providing sufficient material for the TerritorialArmy/in the same -fc aaefc-&amp;  way as the Regular Army,     Ifwar were to break out and the Regular Army were despatched abroad, concern would soon arise as to howit was to be reinforced.     From this it followed thatthe announcement already made as to providing sufficientarmament for training only was not sound, since it would hardly be practicable to take away the trainingequipment of the Territorial Army in order to equipa couple of Divisions to reinfox^ce the Regular army at the very moment when recruits were pouring in.The right policy was to equip the Territorial Army onsuch a basis that-eartase^Divisions could be sent out at
intervals of X months.     Under the conditions suggested,however, the Army Council were not permitted to do morethan provide training equipment and that, he felt, wasa policy on which the Government could not standpermanently.      Consequently, the Army Council had proposed that war equipment and reserves should heprovided to enable a Territorial Army contingent of four Divisions to be sent out four months after theoutbreak of war.     In the view of his Military Advisersthat was a minimum.      The Director General of munitions production had informed him that within the next threeyears, little more could be done than to equip theRegular Army and to meet the training requirements ofthe Territorial Army.     If,  therefore, approval were now given to the proposal contained in paragraph 17 (i) itwould entail practically no increase in expenditure duringthe next three years.     At the end of March, 1940,however, we might well be faced with the completion ofthe programme contained in paragraph 16 and, if no further orders were to &quot;be given, the supply situation would become very awkward.      If, however, a decision was taken now thaton the completion of the present approved Programme, four divisions were to be equipped as he had proposed, theProgramme could be continued and the difficulties in the eventual easing off of the full Programme would be facilitated.     Such a policy, based on a defensibledecision, would, he suggested, make matters easier for theGovernment&apos;s successors.     He asked also that theCabinet would bear in mind the suspicions of theTerritorial Army as to whether they were taken seriously.It was difficult to give them much confidence, on thebasis of equipment for training only, so he hoped &quot;thatthe Cabinet would find it possible to approve theproposals in paragraph 17 (i) of his memorandum whichcontemplated that war equipment and reserves should beprovided for a Territorial Army contingent of four
Divisions.     The proposals in paragraph IV (ii) on whichhe also asked for a decision merely contemplated -f n \investigations with a view to determining the furtherindustrial capacity required for maintaining in thefield the remaining eight Divisions of the TerritorialArmy and for providing such of their equipment as could he manufactured after the outbreak of war on theassumption that they would proceed overseas during the sixth and seventh months after the outbreak of war.The Minister for Go-Ordination of Defencerecalled the recent history of this question.    &apos; InJanuary, 1937, a Report by the Chiefs of Staff had contained the following irecomrnendation:-&quot;(xiv)    So far as the Territorial Army isconcerned, it should be our ultimate aim to equip it to a scale which would enable it to be ready four months after theoutbreak of war.&quot;^paragraph 38 of CP. 41(37))He himself had circulated a memorandum (CP. 46 (37))in the course of which he had criticised that proposal as too great a burden and had suggested that, whilethe equipment of the Regular Army and the two Anti-aircraft Divisions of the Territorial Army must be themost complete and efficient that could be designed, itwould suffice to give the remainder of the. TerritorialArmy sufficient equipment to enable them to be trained in the use of the same weapons as the Regular Army.     Hehad suggested that if this were done, one or more divisions could be sent out in reinforcement of theRegular Army after not more than four months from theoutbreak of war.     The Minister then pointed out that theproposal of the Secretary of State for War went further than his own proposal but not so far as that of theChiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.     In paragraph 16, theSecretary *f State for War had only asked for confirmation
of the previous decisions that the Regular Army and thetwo Anti-aircraft Divisions of the Territorial Army shouldhe provided with the most complete and efficient equipment and with the necessary war reserves and that the remainder of the Territorial Army should receive sufficientequipment of the same type as the Regular Army to enablethe twelve Divisions to be trained in peace althoughestimates of the cost v/ere heavy.     In paragraph 17 (i),the Secretary of State asked for war equipment and reserves for a Territorial Army contingent of four divisions.      The Minister thought that there had been someerror in the estimate of cost owing to the provision of 10,000,000 for industrial mobilisation having been countedtwice over and that the figure should be  33,000,000 insteadof  43,000,000.     Whatever the figure, however, therecommendation was founded on the view of the professionalheads of the War Office that it was not a defensibleproposition to have four Divisions which v/ere provided witharms but with no reserves to maintain them in the field.The Military Advisers pointed out that if the RegularArmy were sent abroad at the outset of war, it would meanreinforcement and all we should have to send would be fourTerritorial Divisions without any reserves of war material.To produce those reserves after the outbreak of war wouldtake a long time in any event, but more especially when thegreat needs of the Air Force after the outbreak of war were taken into consideration.      Of course, an imaginablepolicy was to send the five Divisions of the Regular Armyabroad on the understanding that they could not be reinforced,but, if any reinforcement was contemplated, four Divisionsappeared to him to be the minimum.     The Army Authoritiesinsisted on that number.      Consequently, although theproposals now before the Cabinet went further than his ownearlier proposal, they were, he thought, a corollary tothem.     The proposal in paragraph 17 (ii) of CP. 115 (37)
6f the previous decisions that the Regular Army and thetwo Anti-aircraft Divisions of the Territorial Army shouldhe provided with the most complete and efficient equipment and with the necessary war reserves and that the remainder of the Territorial Army should receive sufficientequipment of the same type as the Regular Army to enablethe twelve Divisions to he trained in peace althoughestimates of the cost were heavy.     In paragraph 17 (i),the Secretary of State asked for war equipment and reserves for a Territorial Army contingent of four divisions.

Of course, an imaginablepolicy was to send the five Divisions of the Regular Armyabroad on the understanding that they could not be reinforced,but, if any reinforcement was contemplated, four Divisionsappeared to him to be the minimum.     The Army Authoritiesinsisted on that number.      Consequently, although theproposals now before the Cabinet went further than his ownearlier proposal, they were, he thought, a corollary tothem.     The proposal in paragraph 17 (ii) of CP. 115 (37)
was mainly one for investigation by the Supply Board,The critical decision, however, was as to whether weshould plan our supply arrangements on the basis of four Territorial Divisions being so equipped as tobe. able to take the field at the end of four months.He was assured that if that basis were adopted, thewhole scheme could be planned on more economical lines.For example, some parts of the equipment of theRegular Army would probably oe completed before 1939.If this decision were taken, it would be possible togive a repeat order straight away instead of allowinglabour and plant to become idle and possibly dispersed.The whole plan could be laid out more economically ifa decision were taken.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he hadnot had as much time as he could wish for studying thisquestion.     He recalled that after long discussions atthe Cabinet a compromise had been reached as set forth in paragraph 1 of the Secretary of State for War*smemorandum Gap. 115 (37) under which the War Office havebeen Instructed to work out an estimate of the cost onthe basis of the proposals of the Minister forCo-Ordination of Defence.     Although, in his memorandum cp. 46 (57),  the Minister for Co-Ordination of defence had suggested that the provision of training equipment in time of peace would enable one or more Divisions tobe sent abroad a few months after the outbreak of war,he thought there was no doubt that the Minister had two divisions in his mind.     Referring to the proposals inparagraph 17 (ii) of CP. 115 (37) which had been spoken of as based on hypothetical assumption, he pointed outthat what was hypothetical one day was apt to be assumedas practical a little later.     He then pointed out that
the proposals before the Cabinet contained many detailsthat had not yet been approved.     He found it verydifficult if, when the Cabinet had reached a decision,they later found that it had been torn up.     Thepresent proposal really went back to much earlier proposals.     It began by doubling the original decision in favour of two Divisions and substituting four divisions and then went on to suggest, a further eightDivisions.     Referring to the argument that the divisions were of no value unless they were properly equipped, he recalled that for some time he had urged that the man-power problem was getting continually more important andhe was very doubtful as to whether the War Office wereright in assuming that the man-power for their proposals would be available.     Two Divisions of the TerritorialArmy had already been turned over to Anti-aircraft defences and these appeared to be continually extendingand more men would be required.     He did not believe thatthey were at the end of their demand for Anti-aircraft defences, and to these now had to be added large numbersof more or less disciplined men for air raid precautions.Referring to paragraph 6 of CcP. 115 (37), he doubted if history would support the theory that &quot;It is axiomaticthat a formation cannot take the field until it isprovided with its full scale of war equipment, etc.&quot;     Onthat theory,there ought to be eight more Divisions behind the proposed four Territorial Divisions - in fact thatwas what the War Office appeared to have in mind.     Theproposal began with the proposition that we should have avery small but perfectly equipped Regular Army which wouldbe of real value even among the large armies of thecontinent.      Then the argument continued that it is
axiomatic that equipment and armament must he the samefor the Territorial Army, and four Divisions of whichmust he kept fully equipped on the same scale as theRegulars^.     Eventually this was doubled again.     he recalled that the original D.R.C. Report of 1934 had contemplated an expenditure of  146,000,000 for theArmy.      The Oabinet, however, had decided to postpone the Territorial Army part of the expenditure which hadbeen cut down to  100,000,000, of which  85,000,000was to be spent before 1941,     In July, 1936, this had been raised and in December, 1936, it had reached 177,000,000.     Now the figure for the Army (excluding the 12 Territorial Army Divisions) was more than 204,000,000.      The figure contemplated in 1935 had beendoubled.     That was for the Army alone, but he thoughtit only right to warn the Cabinet that an approach bythe Admiralty for a much larger Naval Programme wasforeshadowed.      The Royal Air Force had already hadmany increases and now Air Raid Precautions were verypersistento     Expenditure was also likely to be askedfor whether for food storage or food production.     Notonly were all these demands additional to the contemplated  1,500,000,000 but they involved immediateadditions to current expenditure.     He warned theCabinet that we were approaching the time when hewould have to propose a fixed limit to which the-Services would have to conform,     In these circumstances,he felt that further time was necessary to examine thesequestions and that they should be reviewed in the lightof both the financial situation and the man-power position.The Secretary of State for Air, as Chairmanof tlie Man-Power Committee for many years, said he did
not anticipate that man-power difficulties v/ould arise in war over eight Divisions, which was a very much smaller force than had been contemplated in the originalcalculations.     The real difficulty was in assessing thedemands of factories and that could not be done untilthe whole of the Supply Committees had produced acomplete review of their labour requirements.     He hoped,therefore, that the decision would not be postponed untilthat investigation was completed.The Minister for Go-Ordination of Defenceurged that if a final decision could not be given onthe whole of the questions raised in the memorandumby the Secretary of State for War, at least interimdecisions should be given to enable work to be plannedon the bases on which the Secretary of State for war had been asked to work out his proposals, namely,(i)    The Regular Army and the two Anti-aircraftDivisions of the Territorial Army must beprovided with the most complete and efficientequipment:(ii) The remainder of the Territorial Army must be trained in the use of the same weapons as theRegular Army:(iii)    For this purpose,  they must be given sufficientequipment for training purposes which v/ould bespread evenly over the whole of the twelveDivisions.He recalled that the question had been raised as long ago as the 16th December, 1936 (Cabinet 75 (36) conclusion) and had been dragging on ever since.     He would ratherobtain a decision as suggested above than nothing at all,leaving the remainder of the decisions to be made asdesired by the Chancellor of the Exchequer after furtherenqui ry.On the proposal of the Chancellor of theExchequer, the Cabinet agreed:(a)   That the question should be placed onthe Agenda at their next regular weekly meeting;
(b)    That in the interval the Chancellorof the Exchequer should discuss withthe Minister for Co-Ordination ofDefence and the Secretary of State forWar what was the extent of theProgramme to which, in the presentcircumstances, he could now agree a,
ministers 6.    The Home Secretary reported that if the salaries:MINISTERS OP        Ministers of the Grown Bill, as at present drafted,THE GROWN BILL.were to become law one of the members of the(Previous Cabinet who was now in the House of Commons would reference:Cabinet 14 have to be moved into the House of Lords.      The(37), Con-clusion 9) reason for this was that Part I of the firstfr.2.3(37)^.   Schedule to the Bill contained a list of Ministers,three of whom were to sit in the House of Lords.As a matter of fact, however,  only two were actually in the House of Lords.      What had been intendedwas that one of the Ministers mentioned in Part ii of the Schedule should be in the House of Lordsmaking three altogether apart from the LordChancellor.      The pight course, therefore,  appearedto be to accept the Opposition amendment that only two out of the list in Part I of the first schedule should be in the House of Lords, and add&quot;one out of the list in Part II&quot;.The above proposal was agreed to.The Home Secretary then raised two other questions, namely, as to whether Ministers, the salary of whose Office would be raised by the Bill,should vote, and as to whether members of theGovernment should vote for the salary of the leader of the Opposition.The Cabinet agreed:(a) That the Home Secretary should accept the amendment of theLabour Opposition Party to theeffect that only two of theMinisters in Part I of the first schedule to the Ministers of theCrown Bill should be in the Houseof Lords, but that he should add tothose two one of the Ministers outof Part II of the Schedule.
(b) That Ministers holdingappointments the salaries attachedto which would be raised by theBill should refrain from voting in Parliamentary divisions on theappropriate clauses.(c) That all members of the Governmentshould support the prevision inthe Bill for providing a salaryfor the Leader of the Opposition.
REPORT OP ROYAL       7.

He suggested that theF.R.1t^(y))%.   Cabinet should give the White Paper general approval and authorise the Home Secretary to consult theDepartments concerned about details.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that hehad heard a suggestion that the portion of the white paper dealing with profits might include a referenceto the N.D.C. tax.      He hoped that this proposal would not be adopted as it would be a sort of admission that the Government*s proposals forchecking profiteering were not effective.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence,while not questioning the Prime Minister1s proposal that the Home Secretary should consult some of hiscolleagues on details,  asked if this would enable him to suggest rather substantial amendments.      He- had noticed in some parts of the White Paper argumentshad been used which went beyond those cited in theRoyal Commission1s Report.    This would put theGovernment in the position of having to defend these arguments instead of standing behind the Reportitself.
The Home Secretary agreed that amendments ofthis nature should certainly he brought up.The Cabinet agreed:(a) To approve in principle the draft white Paper attached to CP. 120(37)*(b) That details should be left to theHome Secretary in consultation with:The Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs.The Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence.The Secretary of State for War.The Secretary of State for Air.The First Lord of the Admiralty.The President of the Board of Trade.
