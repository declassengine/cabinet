THE LONDON 1; The Cabinet had before them a Joint MemorandumNAVAL TREATY,  by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affe.irs and theRatificationof. Pirst Lord of the Admiralty (CP.-162 &apos; 37))  informingtheir colleagues that the French Government, for(previous reference; Parliamentary reasons, were now pressing His Majesty cabinet 14(37), Con-     Government very hard to ratify the London Naval Treatyclusion 5 0)of 1936 before the end of the present month.    The two ministers  considered that, there was every advantage in adopting this  course, whether the bilateral negotia-tions with Germany and Soviet Russia, (which were nowin a. well advance^ state) had been finally concludedor not.    Ratification would ensure the preservation of the qualitative limitations  contained in the Treatyat least as between Prance, the United States ofAmerica and. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United.Kingdom and. the Dominions  concerned, and would  give a.lead to the- other principal Naval Powers in the matterof naval limitation...    If the Cabinet considered that parliament should be given an opportunity of expressing their vie s on the Treaty before ratification took place,this  coul^ most easily be done on the Second. Reading ofche London Naval Treaty (1935) Bill.The Pirst Lord of the Admiralty informed, the Cabinetthat the French Government, had. now decided to ratify the Treaty next week in any event.    Consequently July1st was a less  critical date than appeared from theMemorandum.    In reply to questions he said, that the Bill,was in draft.    Technically it would be in order to ratify the Treaty now and to postpone the Bill untilthe autumn if it was impossible to find time for its passage before the Recess.    It was very probable, however,that, the House of Commons might object to that course.Alternatively it would be possible to postponera.ti.fication until the Autumn Session, when the Bill
9 -3 9*3 1 Ccould be introduced?    but if that course were adopted the French Government would  consider that we hadtreated them badly.    It had to be remembered also thatthe United States of America, had already ratified .In the course of the discussion it was shown to bevery doubtful whether Parliamentary time could be found for passing the Bill before the Recess.    It was suggestedalso that the position in regard to the Treaty was rather an uncertain one on which to base legislation,since neither the German, Russian nor Japanese Govern-ments had yet adhered to the Treaty.^he Cabinet agreed  To postpone a decision until the PrimeMinister had had time to consult theParliamentary Secretary to the treasury on the Parliamentary time-table, into which certain new factors had just been introduced.(During the discussion of the above subject theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs entered the room.)
didSPAIN.&apos; Sc   The Secretary of State- for Foreign Affairs. reported that since the Meeting referred to &quot;in the(previous reference:    margin there had heen two Meetings of the representa-Cahinet 25(37),  Con-   tives of the four Powers concerned in the non-el us inn 2.)intervention control service.   He had followed thelines approved at the Cabinet and had madethe-augg.estionof the President of the Board of Trade that all thepowers concerned in the control service should agreethat none of their submarines should submerge while in Spanish waters.   At the first Meeting it had become clear that the German representative had receivedinstructions to press for a joint demonstration atValencia.   At the end of the Meeting he (the foreign secretary) had drawn up a draft Communique showing that. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom^could not agree to join in such a demonstration.The representatives of the German and Italian Govern-ments had then asked for a. little more time forconsideration and the Meeting had adjourned.   Beforethe adjournment the German representative had suggestedthat the demonstration might be made against both parties to the Spanish Civil tfar an^ not only againstthe Valencia Government.   A further Meeting had. takenplace on the previous day, when the German ambassador had. reported, that his instructions were categoricaland that he had +0 insist on a joint demonstration atValencia and d-emand-s being made -a-ga-ins-t. the Governmentlocated there-only .    If this was agreed to the germans would  consent to an Inquiry.   He (the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs) had. not been able to agreeto this, and. eventually a Communique had, been agreed towhich was published  in today&apos;s Press.On the previous evening, at about 8 p.m.. theFrench Foreign Minister had telephoned, that he had
some reasons for fearing, from a conversation whichthe French Ambassador in Berlin had had with Baron vonNeurath, that the German Government might be intending to take some independent action of a drastic character.M. Delb6&apos;s had suggested a joint demarche by theBritish and French Ambassadors at Berlin in whichregret should be expressed that agreement had notbeen reached in London, together with the hope thatthe German Government would not take any actioncalculated, to check co-ope tat ion.   The Foreign secretary had then seen the French Ambassador in London and had subsequently sent telegram No. 113 to His Majesty&apos;sAmba.ssa.dor at Berlin irt which he instructed the ambassador to see Baron von Neurath forthwith and to impress upon him the importance of doing nothing which might, make it difficult for the Governmentsconcerned to co-operate more closely in the future in dealing with the Spanish problem as a whole(Appendix).    At midnight he had received informationthrough Press sources to the effect that Germany was going to withdraw from the^patrol of Spain,  to blockadeSpanish ports and to prevent Spanish ships from goingto Valencia..&apos;    also that certain representatives of theGerman Foreign Office, who were to have proceeded toVienna for negotiations with the Austrian Government,were required in Berlin,   &quot;^arly the same morningHis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Berlin had telephoned, tosay that he had not yet been able to get in touch withthe German Minister for Foreign Affairs.    The Secretaryof State had insisted that. he. must manage to do sobefore noon, when it was understood that the GermanCabinet was to meet, and had added to his previoustelegram (No. 113)  a further message to the effect-. -4-
that if the reports received, in London were correct the German Government was  contemplating action whichwould gravely aggravate an already serious situation.Just before the Meeting of the Cabinet he had againspoken on the telephone to His Majesty&apos;s AmbassadorAmbassadorin Berlin, Tne/had informed him that, he had seen Baronvon Neurath, who stated that he was fully alive to the gravity of the situation, as wasthe German Government:    that, the German Government had decided to withdraw their Fleet from the mediterranean and that was the only action that they had contemplated.Baron von Neurath had added that this decision hadbeen taken in order to avoid aggravating the situationstill further.Suggestions were made that the Foreign :ecret.a.rymight think it wise to send a timely word to the GeruX-r.Government and that the opportunity of this gestureon their part might be taken to establish a ratherwarmer relationship with the German Government.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said,that he had at once replied, to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassadorwith an expression of -gratita-d-e to the German Governmentfor the line they. had. taken, and he proposed, in theHouse of Commons to voice the sat. is fact ion of his majesty&apos;s .jesty&apos;s Government in appropriate terms.A question was raised, as to whether the gap in theNaval patrol which would, be created by the withdrawalof the German Fleet ought to be considered..The Cabinet were remin^e^ that this was a matter forthe International Non-intervention Committee *General satisfaction was expressed atthe Cabinet at the attitude adopted bythe German Government.
THE MILK ACTS,    3. The Chancellor of the Exchequer reported that1934 and 1936.the Cabinet Committee on the Milk Acts, 1934 and 1936,Extension of.had agreed, to recommend the adoption of the proposals(Previous       made by the Minister of Agriculture and FisheriesReference:Cabinet 24   and the Secretary of State for Scotland in CP.-152(37), Con-clusion 7.)

It had been decided notto make any provision in the extending Act. but toconsider the question further in connection withannouncements to be made as to the long-term, milk scheme.The President of the Board of Education made dearthat he had only agreed to the proposal to fix thegrant for the milk-in-s ehools scheme next year at 500,000 instead of at  550,000 on the understandingthat the permanent, milk policy would be applied withinthe next nine or ten months.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries said, he. hoped that the permanent, milk policy would be on theStatut e-Book before that. date.The Minister of Health expressed the hope that proposals for a     permanent milk policy would, be circulated in the nesr future.The Cabinet agreed  -To approve the recommendations of theCabinet Committee, as summarised by theChancellor of the Exchequer above./

The Home Secretary referred to the notice hehad published prohibiting processions, under thePublic Order Act, in districts inhabited by Jews,Eefore doing so he had seen the Leaders of bothOpposition Parties, and they had agreed, in thiscourse.   His action had been taken in consequenceof a Fascist procession of which Sir Oswald Mosleyhad given notice and which was to pass throughdistricts of East London inhabited largely by Jews,Now Sir Oswald had given notice of a procession inKentish Town for Sunday, July 4th.    Kentish Townhad no large Jewish population, but there were reported to be a good many Communists.   He had feltthat he could fes^diy go on prohibiting -p^e-ces-s-ierisindefinitely and that in the case under consideration the best course,    indeed the only course, was toallow it to take place, to confine it as far aspossible to safe streets, and. to take every possibleprecaution to avoid the disturbance of public order.The Cabinet approved the decisionof the Home Secretary.
