Thetheir disMeeting rbefore th
arise on practical and. sentimental groundsin Scotland, we suggest that the administra-tion of Part IV of the Bill in scotland should he entrusted to a senior and experienced official in the veterinaryservice of the Ministry of Agricultureand Fisheries-  who should he permanentlystationed in Edinburgh and who should hecapable wf dealing with all matters arising in the day-to-day administration of theservice other than those involving questionsof policy which would,  of course9  have tabe reserved for decision to the Minister inLondon.&quot;The Secretary of State for India,  as Chairman ofthe Cabinet Committee,  explained   the conclusions reached by the Committee as set out in their Report,  and theMinister of Agriculture and Fisheries stated that he had discussed with the Secretary of State for Scotland thesuggestion that an experienced official of his department should be permanently stationed in Edinburgh and should deal with the day-to-day administration of the serviceother than questions of policy.    They were both in agree-ment that the suggestion was a good one, but they wouldlike to consult together as to the best means of giving effect to it.      The suggestion involved no modificationof the Bill as drafted.The Secretary of State for Scotland thought thatthe best solution might be that the official in Edinburghshould be an experienced Administrative Official of theMinistry of Agriculture and Fisheries,  and not an officialin the Ministry1s veterinary service.The Lord President of the Council said that after consulting with the Minister of Agriculture and Fisherieshe did not wish to pursue the points on the Bill which hehad raised at the previous Meeting of the Cabinet.The Minister 6f Agriculture and Fisheries saidthat he had arranged with the Parliamentary Secretary
to the Treasury that the Financial Resolution shouldhe tabled that night and that it should be taken onMonday, June 28th. ,  and the Second Reading of the Billon Friday,  July 2nd.The Cabinet agreed :(a) Tc adopt the recommendation of theCabinet Committee in Paper CP. 160(37)that the scheme embodied in Part iv of the draft Agriculture Bill,  underwhich the administration of that partof the Bill is to be entrusted through-out Great Britain to a unified veterinaryservice under the- Ministry of Agricultureand Fisheries, was sound and should beadopted.(b) That the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Scotland,  shouldtake such action as may seem desirablealong the lines of the recommendation ofthe Committee as to the administrationof Part IV of the Bill in Scotland.(c) To take note,  with approval,  in regard to(b) above, of the suggestion of theSecretary of State for Scotland that itmight be found desirable that the official of the Ministry of Agriculture andFisheries to be stationed in Edinburghshould be an Administrative Officer ofthe Ministry rather than an officer inthe Ministry&apos;s veterinary service.(d) To authorise the introduction in theHouse of Commons forthwith of the agriculture Bill in the form of the draft annexed to Paper H. A,  22 (37),  subject,as recommended by the Home Affairs Committee,to the settlement of the cutstandingpoints on Clauses 6,  9,  10(3),  13,  14 and27,  and to any drafting or other minor alterations that may be found necessary or desirable, with a view to the passage ofthe Bill into law before the Summer Recess.(e) To take note that the Financial Resolutionwould be tabled in the House of commons that evening and would be taken on Monday,June 28th.,  and that the Second Reading ofthe Bill should be taken on Friday,July 2nd.
THE SITUATIONIN SPAIN.The allegedattacks on theGerman Cruiser&quot;Leipzig&quot;.(previous reference:Cabinet 24(37),  Con-clusion l).er. z2.    The Secretary of State fpr Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet    of   the facts which he had laidbefore the Foreign Policy Committee that morning inregard to the allegations of the German Government thattheir Cruiser &quot;Leipzig&quot; had been attacked by SpanishGovernment submarines when north of Oran on the Afri&amp;ancoast.      On Saturday, June 19th, the German ambassador in London had communicated to the Foreign Office a Notesetting out the facts of the alleged attacks, andrequesting His Majesty1s Government to arrange that thefour Governments, parties to the Agreement cf the 12thJune,  should immediately concert measures to be takenin common.      Notes in similar terms were addressed atthe Same time to the French and Italian Ambassadors inLondon.      In the Note of the 19th June it was statedthat while no submarines were actually seen by those onboard the &quot;Leipzig&quot; the tracks of the torpedoes were observed.     At the meeting to-day the german ambassador had given the further information that ithad been ascertained that one of the torpedoes hadtouched the &quot;Leipzig&quot;.The first meeting of the representatives ofthe four Powers had been held on the evening of saturday, June 19th, when the German Ambassador had made the following three demands on behalf of hisGovernment:-(i) that there should be a strong navaldemonstration by the four Powers beforeValencia in the immediate future;
(ii) that the Valencia Government should be-told to surrender their submarines, whichshould be placed under some form of neutralcontrol by the four Powers;(iii) that a very serious -nd urgent warning should be sent to Valencia on the strengthof this incident informing the ValenciaGovernment that if any attack were againlaunched on any ship engaged in the navalcontrol service immediate aporopriatereprisals would be taken by the four Powers.At the meeting in question the British andFrench representatives had indicated that it would benecessary for them to consult with their governments on these proposals.      The Italian representative had stated that his Government entirely concurred in theproposals    of the German Government.      The second meeting of the representatives of the four Powers hadbeen held that afternoon when the German ambassador had furnished more information in regard to the incident.      The French Ambassador had stated that theFrench Government could not agree to any retaliatory action being ta :en until after a full inquiry hadelucidated the facts.     He proposed t: at in additionto the inquiry the four Powers should issue a warning to both sides in Spain to the effect that in the eventof a recurrence of an incident of this kind joint action would be taken if no redress was forthcoming.He, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,had informed the representatives of the other powers at the meeting that His Majesty&apos;s Government favoured the taking of three steps:(i) an immediate inquiry by naval experts onthe lines suggested by the French Government.This inquiry might be of any scope orcharacter.
The German Ambassador had asked why any inquirywas necessary:    had not all the relevant facts alreadybeen produced?     He,  the Secretary of State, had repliedthat we desired the inquiry &quot;because it was customaryto have a hearing before conviction;  adding that we shouldbe ready to submit to exactly the same procedure if oneof our naval ships had been attacked..(ii) in addition to the inquiry under (i) above,there should be an expert investigation by the four Powers to ascertain whethermeasures could not be taken to ensure the better protection of &quot;aval vessels engagedin the control serviceo      He had said thatone possible measure might be to insist onall Spanish submarines remaining in portwhile the Powers concerned should withdraw their submarines from the Spanish coasts.(iil) that a warning statement should be addressedto both sides in Spain on the lines of the warning suggested by the French Government*The German Ambassador had indicated his dislikeof these suggestions6     He had expressed the opinionthat the Valencia Government needed a lesson,   and inregard to this the French   Ambassador had aptlyobserved that that Government had had a lesson in the bombardment of Almeria, w&quot; ich had apparently had noresulto      Herr von Ribbentrop had then asked for ajoint naval demonstration and had indicated that whilethe other German _d.es iderata might wait his government attached very great importance to a naval demonstration,and if they failed to secure this, he, Herr von ribbentrop, did not know what line   they might  lecideto adopt.      In reply to questions, he had indicated thathe did not contemplate that the ships taking parr-
in the demonstration would do more than steam to and fro  .outside Valencia,He, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,had pointed out that the Spanish Government hadvigorously   denied that any of their submarines could have been implicated as they were ell in port,  and theyhad offered every facility for an inquiry.      Herr von ribbentrop had brushed this aside and had refused even to take note of the Spanish Government&apos;s assurances.The representatives of the four Powers were tomeet again that evening at 9.0 p.m.      He, the Secretaryof State,  did not think that it was possible for us togo further than the three suggestions which he hadalready made..    At the meeting that afternoon he had pointed out the fundamental differences between theGerman and Italian point of view, demanding reprisalsbefore an. inquiry,  and the British and French point oftheview, which insisted on/facts being first ascertained bymeans of an expert inquiry before any action was decided upon.It was suggested that this incident showed the wisdom of having neutral observers on the naval controlves-sels.      On the other hand it was pointed out that%he detection of submarines and torpedoes depended on theuse of very secret instruments which no naval authorities would ever allow neutral observers to make use of.      Asagainst this it was pointed out that the presence of neutral observers might be very useful in the case of attacks other than submarine attackso
In reply to enquiries, the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs said that the German Governmentclearly wanted some immediate action taken.    If nothing was done it was possible that they might arrange somejoint naval demonstration with the Italians.Reference was made to the question ef the recog-nition of General Franco&apos;s Government which had beenconsidered at an earlier stage, but a decision on whichhad been deferred until Madrid had fallen.      Might notthe fall of Bilbao,  justify the re-examination ef thisquestion?The Cabinet were reminded, however, that at anearly stage Germany and Italy had recognised theGovernment of General Franco as the Government of spain, and this had made it impossible for all thePowers to agree to confer belligerent rights on bothsides.It was   suggested   that if the &quot;Leipzig&apos; wasmarked by a torpedo, the Germans should have less. . ^ pointed out that it wasobjection to an Enquiry, but it  wa$7very improbable that any mark would he of so definite a character thatan impartial Tribunal would find that it could nothave been caused by anything else than a torpedo.The President of the Board of Trade thought thatthere was some justification for the German point ofview.      It might well be that the Spaniards on one side or the other were trying to sow dissention amongthe Powers by attacking $fche eiaval controlvessels.     Would it not be advisable to press thesuggestion that an Enquiry should be held as to what further measures could be taken to ensure theprotection of the naval control vessels?     Might not
all the Powers concerned in the control service he invited to agree that none of their submarines shouldsubmerge while in Spanish Waters so that any submarinewhich did submerge in those Waters would be a Spanishsubmarine against which appropriate action should betaken?     In effect this meant warning both sides in spain that if the naval control vessels came across anysubmerged submarines they considered themselves justifiedin sinking them.The Secretary of State for Air agreed with thePresident of the Board of Trade.    The German Ambassadormight well ask whether if he accepted the proposedEnquiry and that Enquiry established beyond doubt thata Spanish Government submarine had attacked the&apos;Leipzig&apos; what action would then be taken.The Prime Minister thought that in such circum-stances the Pour Powers should demand satisfaction fromthe Valencia Government, and the Cabinet were reminded that in the case of the Dogger Bank incident we had insisted on an apology and payment of compensation tothe victims by the Russian Government.i It was pointed out that the effect ofthe suggestion of the President of the Board of Tradewpuld be to sterilise the submarines belonging to bothsides in Spain,  and this might be less advantageous tothe Valencia Government than to General Franco, whopossessed fewer submarines than did the ValenciaGovernment.The Prime Minister thought that there might be advantages in bringing forward the President of theBoard of Trade&apos;s suggestion.      In effect both sides in spain would be told that if any submarines were caughtsubmerged, they would be liable to Qe sunk.
The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was apprehensive of giving Germany the right to sink anvthingat sight.The President of the Board of Trade observed thatno Valencia submarine would, in fact, ever go out of port if the rule was in force,The Lord-.President of the Council thought that ifwe had made this suggestion our position would be very greatly strengthened in the event of Germany taking up anuncompromising attitude.The Prime Minister pointed out that the position should be borne in mind of German officers on naval shipswho found that they could not effectively protect them-selves against these attacks.The Secretary of State for Air observed that the rev/ould be a great outcry in this country if we suffered100 casualties on one of our capital ships and if one ofour cruisers was to be torpedoed.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointedout that this had not, in fact, happened to us because,unlike the Germans, we had nc soldiers or aircraft operat--ing against the Valencia Government.      He undertook,however,  to consider whether it might not be advisable tosubmit the suggestion of the President of the Board ofTrade t&amp; the Four Power Meeting that evening.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs  agreed with the Lord President of the Council that if we were tomake this suggestion we should be on very much strongerground in the event of the discussions breaking down.The Prime Minister said that having shown so muchpatience for so long it would be a great pity now toforfeit what had been gained.      He thought that theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs should inform
the Representatives of the other three Powers that wecould not agree to the German proposal about a navaldemonstration.     An Enquiry must first be held toascertain the facts,  and we would also agree to an enquiry to see whether any mere effective measures couldbe designed to protect the naval vessels on the controlservice.      In this connection the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs would no doubt consider whether,  in allthe circumstances, it would be wise to bring forward theproposal of the President of the Board of Trade.      Ifthe suggested Enquiry showed that the German allegationswere true, we ought not to say here and now what action we should be prepared to take.      This should be thesubject of further consideration at a later stage.The Cabinet took note that at the Four power meeting that evening the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs would proceed on the lines indicated in thecourse of the discussion and summarised above.Whitehall Gardens, S. W. 1.21st. June,  1937.
