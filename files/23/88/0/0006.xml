2. The Cabinet again discussed., in the lightof the latest information and of a Debate inParliament on the previous evening, the question ofthe advice to shipowners as to voyages to Bilbao,Santander and Gijon.The Parliamentary Secretary to the Board ofTrade, who, in the unavoidable absence of thePresident, represented the Board of Trade, gave thelatest information received by his Department on thesubject.    This included a communication from theUnited Kingdom Chamber of Shipping, who consideredthat the following of the Governments advice by shipping not to attempt to enter Bilbao involved a breach of warranty, since, in the view of theChamber, the blockade was not effective.   The presentwarning invalidated insurance policies in respect ofvoyages to Bilbao.   All Insurance Companies agreed,however, that so far as Santander an^ Gijon were concerned the policies stood.    If the ban could be lifted it. would please the shipowners, the steelindustry, and South Wales.    The Board of Trade wouldbe glad if the advice coul^ be altered so as tojustify ships sailing to Bilbao.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs pointed out. the difficulty in altxi ing the fijjs^ji^U:instructions^resulted fruom the changeability of thesituation.    It was difficult, perhaps, to say at thepresent moment that Bilbao was effectively blockaded.The British Consul had advise^ that, according to hisobservation, insurgent warships invariably kept manymiles out to sea, out of range of the batteries:    andthere was one case where an insurgent warship hadbeen hit. and ha&apos;1 sustained damage.    It was difficultto say, therefore, that Consular information bore
out the proposition that the &quot;blockade was effective.According to Press reports, also, a British ship had entered the port on the previous day without any opposition.   He did not say there was no risk;    thequestion was the degree of risk.    Tt might he thatthe degree of warning was excessive in present circum-stances, and in that event the notices to shippingmight have to he altered;    but if this were done it should be made clear that we might have to changethem again on receipt of further information.A suggestion was made that, the insurgent warshipsmight very likely have been driven off the coast bybad weather.The First Lord o^ the Admiralty agreed that thesituation was not clear,    ^here had recently been a severe gale, an&apos;1 all ships, both war and merchantvessels, had disappeared from the coast.    In the Houseof Commons on the previous  evening he had made clearth^t the situation was fluid, that it had to be examined from day to day, and that if the blockade didnot prove effecttve he would be the first to recogniseit.   Another difficulty was that information from different sources varied.    It was now reported thatthe insurgents had laid so-ne mines off Santander, andthey might he laying them off Bilbao also.   Mines,however, were not so vital an element as the insurgentwarships, more especially because there was no opposi-tion at sea from the Government side.   The positionin the latter respect had not changed.    It seemed possible that the insurgent forces might be strengthened by two Cruisers that were reported, to have passedwestward, from Gibraltar.   At sea, therefore, theposition was much the same as at the time when theCabinet had reached, its original decision.   A possible
1ff* fnew factor was that the investment of Bilbao by landseemed to have slowed down, and consequently the argument that by encouraging our ships to enter we .might be doing something that savoured of interventionmight have been weakened.   He had great sympathy withthe Board of Trade&apos;s attitude, and would like to do what they wished, but he could not say that the situa-tion had. changed materially.   He thought the right-course was to continue to watch the situation, to ask the Senior Naval Officer on the coast for his view,and, if it was found that our appreciation of theposition had been too pessimistic, to alter the noticesand instructions.   He was opposed, however, to theissue of fresh instructions on present information.In reply to questions as to the coast defences ofBilbao, he said the present information in the admiralty was that although 15-inch guns had been mounted, theyhad no sights and were consequently inefficient.Insurgent warships had often been seen in territorial waters and had. fired, on the port, even though therewas no case of their interfering with British shipsthere.One suggestion was that, it would be better for theGovernment, instead of issuing warnings to shipping,to announce the facts as they changed from time to timeand leave shipowners to form their own opinion.   TheCabinet were reminded, however, that the reason forgiving a warning in the first instance in the case ofBilbao had largely been due to the desire to avoidaction that could be interpreted as injurious to thenon-intervention policy.prom the Parliamentary point of view it was recog-nised that any alteration in the advice to shippingmust be justified by new facts.
1Q  OAfter further discussion, the Cabinet agreed  (a) That the policy of the Government,namely, to afford protection toBritish shipping on the high seasbut not in territorial waters, shouldnot be changed., but that notices to shipping and instructions to the naval commander-in-Chief must depend, uponthe facts of the situation, which were liable to vary from day to day:(b) That, the First Lord of the admiralty should, as soon as possible, send tothe Naval Commander-in-Chief atelegram containing the latest inform-ation as to the entry or the departure of British shipping to or from Bilbao,also an appreciation of the situation as viewed here by such authorities asthe Board, of Trade and the UnitedKingdom Chamber of Shipping, and asking for information as to thefacts of the situation at the disposalof the Naval authorities, and. for the admiral&apos;s own appreciation:( c) That- the First Lord, of the admiralty should, also endeavour to obtain further information as to the stateof efficiency of the coast defencesof Bilbao:(d.) That the Cabinet Committee on theProtection of British Shipping should,meet immedlately after the Meeting ofthe Cabinet, to assist the First Lordof the -Admiralty in drawing up the appreciation referred to in (b):(e) That the Cabinet Committee on theProtection of British Shipping should,also meet on receipt of the reply fromthe Naval Commander-in-Chief, with authority to approve any modifiednotices to shipping or instructionsto Naval authorities that they might consider desirable.
INSURANCE 3.   The Cabinet had before them a Note by theAGAINST . ,   an aircraft AND Minister for Co-ordination of Defence (CP.-114 (37))BOMBARDMENTRISKS. on the subject of Insurance against Aircraft andER IrCj [2)i) fb    Bombardment Risks, circulating an extract from theDraft Minutes of the 292nd Meeting.of the Committeeof Imperial Defence, together with a Memorandum bythe President of the Board of Trade (C.I.D. PaperNo. 1316-B).    The conclusions reached by theCommittee, after consideration of the President&apos;sMemorandum, were as follows:-(a) To make the following recommendations to the Cabinet:-(i) that under the conditions of a future war, so far as they canbe foreseen today, insurance against air risks on land, either in time of peace or on the outbreakof war, is impossible;(ii) that the only practicable course,therefore, is to assume that theGovernment of the da?/- will make available to owners of propertysuch compensation as may be prac-ticable in the light of all thecircumstances of the time;(iii) that an announcement, of which theterms should be drawn up by thePresident of the Board of Trade inconsultation with the Chancellorof the Exchequer, should be madeas soon as possible on the linesthat the Government, after careful review of all the circumstances,have reached the conclusion that no scheme of insurance would be appro-priate to the circumstances of&quot; a future war so far as they can before seen today;    if the conditionsarise which any scheme of insurancewould   be designed to meet, it willbe for the Government of the day toconsider making to owners whose property has suffered damage such compensation as may be possible inthe light of all the circumstancesof the time.(b) That if the above announcement is approvedby the Cabinet  (i) an official Committee should be setup by the President of the Board ofTrade, consisting of representativesof the Treasury, Home Office, Boardof Trade, Ministry of Health and theOffice of Works, to consider what: preparatory work could usefully beput in,hand in time of peace in
1a oanticipation of a compensation scheme in time of war, and to be responsiblefor getting that work done;(ii) the Committee should have authorityto consult confidentially represent-atives of outside interests as maybe necessary;(iii) that a member of the Secretariat ofthe Committee of Imperial defence should, be associated with the committee as Joint Secretary for purposes ofliaison.After hearing from the Minister forCo-Ordination of Defence a summary of therecommendations of the Committee of Imperial Defence,the Cabinet agreed:(a) To approve the recommendations of theCommittee of Imperial Defence as setforth above, subject to the following-modifications : -(b) That the official Committee ,recommended by the Committee ofImperial Defence in (b)(i) should beset up by the Chancellor of theExchequer in consultation with thePresident of the Board of Tradeinstead of by the latter:(c) That the Scottish Office should beadded to the Departments to berepresented on the Committee.
FILM QUOTALEGISLATION.(previous reference:Cabinet 58(36), Con-clusion 9 &amp;Appendix. )4.    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe President of the Board of Trade (CP.-Ill (37))pointing out that the Cinematograph Films Act, 1927,would expire partly in March, 1938, and partly inSeptember, 1938.    The purpose of the Act was toassist in building up the film production industryin the United Kingdom and elsewhere in the Empire by placing an obligation on renters in the UnitedKingdom to acquire, and on exhibitors to show, a proportion of Eritosh films.    The Report of a departmental Committee appointed by him (Cmd.5320)had recommended a continuance of the quota system for a further period of ten years, with which thePresident agreed.    He therefore sought authority to announce that the Government would introduce such legislation before the end of 1937, and proposed to institute at once discussions on that basis withthe trade regarding those recommendations of theCommittee which were the subject of controversy,and to submit detailed proposals to his colleagues in due course.The Cabinet approved the proposals ofthe President of the Board of Trade asset forth in CP. Ill (37) and summarised above.
