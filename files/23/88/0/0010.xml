94 oASSYRIANSIN IRAQ.Report of cabinet committee(previous reference:Cabinet 2(3 7) , Con-conclusion ion 2 ,)(The Parliamentary Under-Gecretary of the ForeignOffice (Lord Granborne) entered at this point.)3.     The Cabinet had before them the Report of theCabinet Committee on the Assyrians in Iraq   (CP.-135(37)), which had. been appointed at the meeting mentioned in the margin to advise on the practicabil-ity of settling the Assyrians, as a homogeneousChristian community, elsewhere than in Iraq, wherethey and their Mohammedan neighbours found, it hard to live peaceably side by side.   The question hadbeen before the League Council for a. number of years but no solution was yet in sight.    In summarisingtheir Report the Committee stated, inter alia, thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government ought not to be regarded, asunder any special responsibility for finding a home for the Assyrians, although they greatly desired, asatisfactory solution of the problem, and. recommendedthat a negative reply be sent to the Committee of theLeague Council so far as provision in the BritishEmpire was concerned, - subject to soundingCommonwealth Ministers attending the ImperialConference as to possibilities in the northern partof Australia.    The Committee feared that the only course remaining to the League Council was tonegotiate with the Government of Iraq with a viewto obtaining improved, conditions for the Assyriansin Iraqi territory.Viscount Granborne reported on behalf ofthe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (absentin Geneva) on the recommendations of the CabinetCommittee,     The Foreign Office had literallycombed the world to try and.find some home for the assyrians in Iraq, but had not been successful intheir efforts.     They had reached the conclusion
contained in the Report of the Cabinet Committee, namely,that the only thing to be done was to leave them in Iraq..The present position was that out of a. total of 30,000Assyrians, 8,000 were in Khabur (in Syria).     Theremainder were in Iraq.     It was suggested that the Khabursettlement should be made permanent, and that there mightbe added to it 2,000 Assyrians who were in remote areasin Norther Iraq.      The remaining 20,000 Assyrians wouldbe readjusted in Iraq.      The League of Nations Committeehad already sent two delegates nominally to examine thepresent position on the Khabur.     They would also makeexamination as to the prospects of a permanent settlementthere.       He did not pretend that there were notdisadvantages and dangers in the course now proposed which involved a risk of conflagration in that part of the East,but he thought that these dangers should not be overt?estimated.     Major Thompson, the local officer for LandSettlement in Iraq, thought these risks were not verygreat.     It was thought that the Syrian Government would accept the proposal and the Foreign Office thought thatthe Iraqi Government might probably accept.     The Turks,would not like the proposal but might accept it if it were carried out quietly.     One advantage of the proposal wasthat the total cost would be in the neighbourhood of 100,000 (namely  50,000 for Khabur and  50,000 for Iraq)instead of  600,000.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs reported that he had made enquiries as to the possibilitiesof settling Assyrians in the northern part of Australia butthat the Commonwealth Government was not willing to adopt this course so that this possible outlet had disappeared andthere remained nothing but the oourse proposed by theCabinet Committee.In the course of the discussion, it waspointed out that this was not really a satisfactory
2&quot;i asettlement and could only be accepted for the reason that there was none other   available.In reply to questions, Viscount Cranborne&apos; indicated that negotiations would have   to     take place at Baghdad^with a view to bringing in the outlyingAssyrians and concentrating them.     An official of theForeign Office who had recently visited Baghdad hadtaken quite informal soundings and had reported thatthere wa-o some- hopes that the Iraqi Government might not object.     The actual negotiations would be undertaken on behalf of the Committee, but v/ould be supported byHis Majesty&apos;s Government.     He did not anticipate thatthere would be a complete failure in these negotiations,He did not wish to suggest that he regarded this as asatisfactory solution or that no dangers were involved,but it appeared the only possible solution.A hope was expressed that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would adopt a reasonably generous attitude in the financial aspects of the negotiation and wouldnot hesitate to pay a reasonable sum, more particularly to bring the episode to an end.The Cabinet agreed:(a) To approve the proposal of theCabinet Committee and to authorisethe Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs to take such steps as were necessary to give effect to theReport:(b) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should keep theCabinet informed of the pro grossof the negotiations^(Lord Cranborne withdrew at this point.)
4c The Cabinet had. before them a Joint MemorandumSOUTHERN RHODES TA,NORTHERN rhodesia and NYASALAND.     by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs andQuestion of closer Union.PR. 31(57)7.the Secretary of State for the Colonies f CP.-137(37)) setting out the recent history of the questionof closer association between Southern Rhodesia,Northern Rhodesia and. Ny as aland, and analysing the issues involved.    The Prime Minister of SouthernRhodesia and two Elected Members of the northern rhodesia Legislative Council were at present in thiscountry and had been informed that, if they so desired, they would, be given an opportunity of discussing the question.    If, as the result of thediscussions, the Secret.-8.ries of State felt satisfiedthat the balance of advantage lay in investigatingsome form of union or closer association, they proposed, to report again to their  colleagues and tomake further proposals .The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs and the Secretary of State for the Colonies madestatements to the Cabinet as to what was proposed.In reply to questions, the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs said that there had been no formal consultation as yet with representativesof the Government of the Union of South Africa0Prom informal conversations, it was known that general smuts and Mr. Pirow were rather favourable to a closer association between the territories concerned,but this did not necessary represent the   view of theUnion Government.      It was not thought advisable to discuss the matter with representatives of thatGovernment until His MajestyTs Government in theUnited Kingdom had cleared its own mind on the
matter.     Such consultation, however, was one of the factors that had to he kept in mind before a decision was reached.In the course of the discussion, it waspointed out that if a decision should eventually betaken to encourage anything in the nature of amalgamation, it would be very necessary to secure theinterests of the natives for which His majesty&apos;s government in the United Kingdom was in the position ofa trustee.     Without a guarantee on this point, itwould be politically impossible to secure theacceptance of the proposal by Parliament.The Cabinet agreed:That the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs and the Secretary of State forthe Colonies should be authorised todiscuss the matter with the PrimeMinister of Southern Rhodesia and the elected members of Northern rhodesia and representatives of Nyasaland and if,as a result of the discussions, they feltsatisfied that the balance of advantage lay in investigating some form of union or closer association, they should reportagain to the Cabinet and make further proposals.to 9
agricultural policy.Product ivityof the Soil.Assistance forOats and Barley(previous reference:Cabinet 21(37), Con-clusion 1 .)ER. 2,1*. (37) 85o In accordance with the Conclusion mentionedin the margin, the Cabinet had before them, a Memo-rand urn by the Secretary of State for Scotland( CP.-140 (37))   containing further proposals for increasing the productivity of the soil and. outlininga plan with the object not of providing a generaland uniform subsidy for growers of oats and barley,but of framing a scheme of insurance againstunreasonably low prices, and. thus to keep the land,under the plough.   His proposals had been discussed-with the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence (whoregarded the scheme as a useful contribution to a.food and feeding stuffs policy&apos; as an alternative to food, storage) , the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries (who agreed with the proposals), and theFinancial &quot;Secretary to the Treasury.   As theFinancial Secretary had not yet. had an opportunityof discussing the matter with the Chancellor of theExchequer, however, the latter&apos;s position &quot;was reserved.In addition to the above, the Cabinet had.before them a Note by the Minister of Agriculture,and. Fisheries (CP.-143 (37))   circulating a. draftof the statement he proposed, to make in the Houseof Commons on May 27th if the Cabinet approved theproposals for assistance to oats and barleyoutlined, in the above-mentioned Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Scotland.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheriesstated that he was in agreement with the suggestions of the Secretary of State for Scotland.The Secretary of State for Scotlandexplained the proposals to his colleagues.The Home Secretary reported that theposition of the Government of Northern Ireland was
that they felt they ought to be brought in to theproposed arrangement for oats and barley.      Theywere already associated in the wheat scheme andcontributed to the fund more than was distributed in Northern Ireland.The Secretary of State for Scotland saidthat the maximum liability proposed on the UnitedKingdom Treasury included Northern Ireland.Representatives of Northern Ireland were nowdiscussing the position with the Treasury.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said thatthis was an ingenious scheme which overcame manyf*f the difficulties of the subject.     The schemeappeared to him to be not too extravagant toreceive his assent and it went a long way to meetthe difficulties of the Secretary of State forScotland as to oats and barley.      Referring to thedraft statement by the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries in CP, 143 (37), he said that so far asNorthern Ireland was concerned he thought itdifficult to resist their claim to be brought intothe oats and barley scheme and did not object to reference to that matter.     So far as an increase inthe productivity of the soil where fertilisers were concerned, however, he asked that the Cabinet shouldtake no decision to-day so far as Northern ireland was concerned and that the question should be kept open for further discussion.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheriesproposed to meet the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;swishes by an alteration on page 3.. line 17, of thedraft statement attached to CP. 143 (37) where he
proposed to put the words &quot;the country&quot; instead of either of the alternatives of &quot;Great Britain&quot; or&quot;United Kingdom-&quot;.      If he was pressed to say whatthe position was   as regards Northern Ireland, he would reply that representations were being made by theGovernment of Northern Ireland in this matter whichwould receive consideration.The Chancellor of the Exchequer asked that,in his statement,  the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries should include what was stated in paragraph 5of the memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland(CP. 140  (37)) that &quot;in no case should the assistanceexceed  1 per acre.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheriesagreed to state that in no case would the subsidy foroats and barley exceed  1 per acre.The Secretary of State for Scotland agreed in this.The Lord Privy Seal suggested that a similar statement should be made in the House of Lords.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheriesagreed to this and asked that the statement should notobemade in connection with the Livestock Industry Bill.The First Commissioner of works agreed inthis as the Livestock Industry Bill was likely to beooatentious.The Lord Privy Seal said he only asked thatthe statement should be made in the House of Lords onthe same day as in the House of Commons.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheriesagreed to arrange this and that the statement should bemade before the Debate on the Livestock Industry Bill.- 12 -
The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheriesasked for the specific approval by the Cabinet of the passages in his draft statement on the subject ofthe relations between these proposals and defence and more particularly of the following passagej-&quot;Having regard to these considerations,the Government are satisfied that thebest course in the general national interest is to continue their efforts toimprove the general prosperity and efficiency of home agriculture, and inparticular to promote an increase in thefertility and productivity of our soil.The proposals are so designed that shouldan emergency arise we should be in aposition immediately to take advantage of improved fertility but, should it notarise, we should be increasing the productivity of the land of this country by means which are consistent with, andnot opposed to, the normal development ofour agriculture on economic lines in timeof peace.&quot;This was agreed to.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheriesasked for authority to invite Parliament to pass legislation on this subject into law before the summer Recess.The Prime Minister pointed out thatthis could only be arranged after consideration ofthe Programme of the Government as a whole.      Itwas no use to promise to introduce legislation ifthere were no prospect of passing it owing to the congestion of the Parliamentary Time-table.     he asked the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries ttolook into the question in detail.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheriesundertook   to omit the following words from the eighth and ninth lines from the bottom of the lastpage of the memorandum attached to CP. 143 (37) -&quot;and Parliament will be invited to pass it into law before the Summer Recess.&quot;
The Minister of Agriculture arid Fisheriesasked that he should he given some latitude as tothe exact terms of the statement attached toCP0 143 (37) which he had had to prepare at rathershort notice0The Cabinet agreed:(a) To approve the proposals of theSecretary of State for Scotland asset forth in CP, 140 (37):(b) To approve generally the draft ofthe statement attached to cp. 143 (37) which the Ministerof Agriculture and Fisheriesproposed to make in the House ofCommons on Thursday next, the27th May, subject to -(i)   An amendment to secure thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government inthe United Kingdom were notyet committed to extend to northern Ireland the measures for increasing the fertilityof the soil and fertilisers,which must be kept open forfurther discussion so far asNorthern Ireland was concerned.This might be done by substituting the words &quot;thecountry&quot; for the alternatives&quot;Great Britain&quot; or &quot;UnitedKingdom&quot; on page 3, line 17  .of the draft statementattached to CP. 143 (37):(ii)    That the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries should make clearthat in no case would thesubsidy for oats and barleyexceed  1 per acre:(iii)    That the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries should arrange that an announcement should bemade of the Government&apos;policy in this matter in theHouse of Lords on the same dayas in the House of commons and before the Debate on the livestock Industry Bill:(iv)   An amendment on the lastpage (penultimate paragraph)to omit the suggestion that parliament should be invitedtp pass the necessary legislation into lav/ beforethe Summer Recess:
(v)   Reasonable latitude to theMinister of Agriculture andFisheries to amend the actualwording of his statement.The acceptance of the tenor of the references to defence in the draft statement attached to CP. 143 (37):That the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries should further examine withthe Parliamentary Secretary to theTreasury the possibility of introducing legislation in the present Sessione
6.     In pursuance of the Conclusion mentioned inthe margin, when the Cabinet postponed a decision onthe Fourth Report of the Committee on the Organisationof the Coal Mining Industry (CP.-128 (37)) pendingconsideration by the Committee of a further proposal by the Treasury, the Cabinet had before them thefollowing additional documents:-The Fifth Report of the Committee onthe Organisation of the Coal MiningIndustry (CP.-139 (37)), who summarisedtheir Conclusions and recommendations as follows:-&quot;(i) We recommend the introduction andpassage into law in the remainingpart of the present Session of aBill to make provision for theascertainment and registration ofparticulars-as to the ownership of unworked. coal and mines of coal and of certain associated, property and rights in land.    It may be con-venient for the Bill to be introduced in the House of Lords.(ii) The main Bill dealing with the restof the Government1 s coal policy shouldbe introduced as the first legislativemeasure o^ the 1937-38 Session.(iii) A statement of policy will benecessary on the resumption of Parlia-ment after the Whitsun Recess.&quot;The Committee also suggested, that aseparate detailed, examination of thedraft Bill by the Home Affairs committee might, be dispensed with:A Note by the President of the Boardof Trade (CP.-142 (37))  covering thelatest -draft of the shorter Billproposed in CP.-139 (37).In the course of a shprt discussion it wassuggested that when the Opal Bill attached to cp.-142. (37) was introduced, the explanatory notecovering the Bill should contain a phrase indicating that in introducing the Bill His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwere implementing the undertaking they had given toRoyalty owners to introduce legislation in the.
present Session.The President of the Board of Trade undertook to ask the Secretary of the Mines Department toconsider and make proposals to carry cut thissuggestion.The Lord Privy Seals as Leader of the House ofLords, referring to the proposal that the Bill shouldbe introduced in the House of Lords, warned the Cabinetthat there was likely to be a certain amount of opposition.The Cabinet agreed:(a) To approve the proposals in the fifth Report of the Committee onthe Organisation of the CoalMining Industry (CP.-139 (37))as summarised above.(b) That the President of the Board ofTrade should ask the Mines Departmentto consider and make proposals on thesuggestion that when the bill attached to CP.-142 (37) was introduced the explanatory notecovering the Bill should contain a reference to the fact that theGovernment were implementing their undertaking to Royalty ownprs tointroduce legislation in tine courseof the present Session of Parliament.

SALARIES OP 12. The Prime Minister reported that followingMEMBERS OP&apos;PARLIAMENT. a discussion on the payment of Members of parliament at the meeting referred to in the margin, he and the(previous reference: Chancellor of the Exchequer had seen some of the^Cabinet 14(57), C^n- Leaders of the Opposition Labour Party in the Houseelusion 9. )of Commons,  and had obtained confidentially a gooddeal of evidence as to the hardships to which certain members of Parliament were exposed owing tothe sraallnesa of the present salary.      The conclusionhe had reached was that there was a case for raising the salary.     He thought it would be best either toleave the matter alone or raise it substantially.If the salary were merely increased to  500 a year there would be discontent and the subject would beraised again.      He thought, therefore, that theamount of the salary should be raised to  600 a year,but should be made subject to income tax.(The Lord President of the Council leftat this point).The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he had discussed the question with the Leader of the labour opposition and Mr. Lees-Smith and had examinedvarious confidential statements as to the hardshipsof certain Members of Parliament,.      He,  like thePrime Minister, had come to the conclusion that 400 a year was an inadequate salary.      The position was changed as compared with former days owing   tothe number of Labour Members who had no privatemeans,  and there was a clear case.for a change.The only question at issue was the amount of the salary.      He wanted to avoid making the salary large
enough to encourage people to enter Parliament asa career,  and many Members of the House of commons would take that view.     The right principle was thatthe salary should be made adequate.      As far as he knew  400 a year had been a purely arbitrary figure,and it was possible that when the matter wasconsidered in 1910 investigation would have shownthat the amount was insufficient.      He took the same view as the Prime Minister,  500 a year was too little and would only result in subsequent grievances.He thought, however, that the Government would beable to stand on  600 a year.On the subject of income tax, he pointed outthat the present salary was subject to income taxto-day although certain deductions were allowed fornecessary expenses.     He thought it undesirable to alter the general application of income tax or to give special preference to Members of Parliament, and hewould prefer to leave the matter as it stood to-day.The Prime Minister said he had not realised .that the salary was already subject b to income tax.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, continuing,said there was another matter that would arise.Many Members of Parliament,  especially among theLabour Party, were much interested in the question ofpensions.      Some had suggested a deduction from the salary every year towards a Pensions Fund for members of Parliament who had served a certain numberof years.      That raised rather a difficult question.
His own view was that when the question pf an increasein salary was &quot;brought before the House of Commons itcould best be dealt with by resolution and not by legislation.      The question of any deductions (e.g. for pensions) should not be dealt with by resolution.      if at some later stage it was desired to make some suchdeductions legislation would be required and this couldbe stated.He himself was doubtful if a scheme of pensionswas a good plan.     He thought it might be possible to institute some kind sf Benevolent Fund to relieveMembers of Parliament in temporary difficulties due tosuch disabilities as illness or unemployment after theloss of the seat.      Whether this should be done by a deduction from salary or by voluntary subscription wasa matter that required further investigation.      If theCabinet approved the Prime Minister&apos;s proposal hesuggested that the matter   could be dealt with in theHouse of Commons by resolution       which should apply only to salaries, and that it should be stated at thdtime that the question of pensions requiredfurtherconsideration aid that if legisaltion became necessaryit should be announced later.In the course of discussion it was suggestedthat if the Cabinet accepted the Conclusion of thePrime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer thereasons for the increase should be stated in theannouncement.      It was also pointed out that there are about 600 Members Of Parliament.      The proposal was toincrease the salary of each Member by  2 00 a yeai?,
although perhaps only one hundred lived in a state ofpenury:    in other words, the State was to pay 200,000 a year instead of an actual need of only 20,000 a year.      A mere logical course would appear tobe to create a fund from which those in need coulddraw additional assistance.      The general view, however,was that as  400 a year was paid already the principle of payment   was firmly established, and it would beimpossible to depart from the principle in the case ofthe increase.One suggestion was that further soundings shouldbe taken among the Government supporters, but thedifficulties were pointed out of ascertaining what thereal view of Members was on this matter.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries recalled that when he was Financial Secretary to the Treasurysome of the junior Ministers had raised with him utheinjustice&quot; of not being allowed to deduct for incometax their expenses as Members of Parliament.      TheLaw Officers of the Crown among others had raised the&quot;point.      He suggested that when this matter wasoonsidered this point might be borne in mind.The Cabinet agreed:(a) To approve the proposal of the PrimeMinister and the Chancellor of theExchequer that the Government should propose to the House of Commons the raising of the Salaries of Membersof Parliament from  400 a year to 600 a year.(b) That the increase in salary should boimplemented by resolution in the Housetvf Commons and not by legislation.
) That if the question of.pensions for members of Parliament were raised itshould be stated that the matter required further consideration,  and that if legislation should become necessary ananno-unoement would be made later.
THE CORONATION.The Seatingof Members ofthe Cabinet.(previous reference:Cabinet 10(37) , Con-elusion 4.)pr. Cj.13.   The Home Secretary, with the permission of the Prime Minister, brought-up a point inconnection with the Coronation arrangements, namely,the seating of members of the Cabinet.   He pointedout that his  colleagues had been scattered allround Westminster Abbey in galleries and in corners.The arrangements made were a survival of thetradition in which prominence was given to thePeerage and. Court Officials.   These were out of date and not in accordance with modern usage.He suggested that the subject should be noted for future occasions.The First Commissioner of Works said that theseating arrangements at Westminster Abbey had beena matter for the Earl Marshal.   He himself had actually raised the question of whether members ofthe Cabinet  could not. sit together, and had. receivedthe reply that it would not have been possible toseat twenty-two members of the Cabinet in the Stalls.He certainly had been surprised, however, at thearrangements actually made.Attention was drawn to the number of foreign representatives who had been accommodated in theStalls in a purely British ceremony.&apos; The Cabinet agreed.  (a) That it was desirable on futureoccasions of this kind that membersof the Cabinet should as far aspossible be seated together:(b) That a; polite message should be sentto the Earl Marshal s Office asking that the Cabinet&apos;s view might beplaced on record for future use:(c) That the Home Secretary should beinvited to draft the above messageand to b^ing it to the Cabinet atan early Meeting.
14.       The Prime Minister said that it was nosecret to his  colleagues that changes would hetaxing place in the Cabinet within a few days.There were two methods by which the prospectivePrime Minister could, secure that the resignationsof the Cabinet were put at his disposal, and hethought that he himself had. resorted to different methods on different occasions.   Sometimes he had.approached, his colleagues by letter, and sometimespersonally.    It would, be much easier for the present-Chancellor of the Exchequer, who would be sent forby the King on Friday, to know that he need, notwrite to every member of the Cabinet.   He would therefore ask his colleagues to relieve the Chancel-lor of the Exchequer of this necessity.After a short discussion the Cabinet agreed..- (a) That the Chancellor of the exchequer should be authorised, to assume that all members of the Cabinet present placedtheir resignations at his d.isposal whenhe was sent for by the King, and thatthere was no necessity for any Ministerto confirm this in writing:(b) That Ministers at the head of GovernmentDepartments should explain the positionto their respective Parliamentary Under-Secretaries and. ascertain that theywere willing to  comply with the arrange-roent recorded in Conclusion (a) above.( c) That, the Secretary to the Cabinet shouldbe instructed to send a copy of this conclusion without delay to members ofthe Cabinet who were not present,-aswell as to Ministers (other thanParliamentary Under-Secretaries) whowere not. members of the Cabinet, and as certain that they are willing to conform to Conclusion (a) .
the PRIME IS.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said heMINISTER.  thought it would he the wish of his  colleagues the lord president. that someone should, say a. few words on the present    THE PRESIDENT     sad occasion when Mr Baldwin was presiding at theOP THE BOARDOP TRADE. Cabinet for the last time.   He would say what heThe Cabinet&apos;s     knew was the personal view of all present.   TheyLeave-taking.were proud to have served under Mr Baldwin in aGovernment, which, he thought it could be said, had avery successful record   a record, which was largely due to the personality of the Prime Minister.   For along time Mr Baldwin had occupied a conspicuousposition in the Government as a. Prime Minister andan ex-Prime Minister.   Perhaps the time had not cometo weigh dp his position in history, but all knewhow much the country owed to him in raising thewhole standard of political life since he first came into office as Prime Minister.    This he had accom-plished &apos;^y his  character, influence and courage insaying things which were not. always acceptable atthe time but were afterwards recognised as wise ands tat esmanl ike .    It was thes e char a ct eris t i cs that had brought him. to a, unique position in the country which had culminated, in the events of November 1936and&apos;ha.d ea.rned for the whole country and. for mr Baldwin himself a world.-wide respect and admiration.He thought that all his  colleagues would, wish him to thank Mr Baldwin on their behalf for his personalkindness to each and. every one of them, and. forhis great leadership during all these years.Mr Chamberlain then said that, he would like to add a few words about the Lord President (who had had to leave the Meeting). Latterly, perhaps, hehad not taken so active a part as formerly in thework of the Cabinet, for the reason that his health
was not what it was and. his present Office did not make so heavy a demand.   He and his  colleagues,however,  could never forget the critical days of1931 and the courageous hut painful decision which mr Ramsay MacDonald. had. found himself obliged totake   a decision which had not fallen to the lot of most members of the Cabinet, and which had. involved,a severance of old friendships with life-longcolleagues, as well as subsequent unmerited depreciartion.   All his  colleagues admired, the  courageousattitude of the present Lord President as a greathistorica.1 fact in the difficult days of 1931.Mr Chamberlain added that all would have toregret the loss of yet another colleague, namely,the President of the Board of Trade, who had informed him that he was bringing to an end hiscareer in the House of Commons.    It was difficult for him to say how much he&apos;owed personally toMr Runciroan.   Mr Runciman had come to the national government after long years in which he and theChancellor himself had been opposed, one to another..He himself at first had felt some apprehension asto the coming association.   He had soon found thathis apprehensions were wholly groundless.    On onlyone occasion could, he recall a difference of opinion,and that was in the matter of financial assistanceto the building of the &quot;Queen Mary&quot;   not a subjectof first, importance.   No-one could, have had a moredelightful colleague.   He had spoken of his personaldebt to Mr Runciman, but the Cabinet as a wholerealised the great success of his administrationof fhe Board of Trade, as testified to by theAgreements at Ottawa and with foreign countries.Mr Runciman would never allow old. prejudices to
prevail against what was in the best interests ofthe country in the circumstances of the day.   he hoped that in the future the Government would havethe sympathy and support of the President of theBoard of Trade.The Prime Minister said that he found difficultyin replying to the remarks of the Chancellor of theExchequer.    He had, of course, looked forward, tothe day when he would be rid of his heavy responsi-bilities.   He knew, however, that he was right to retire.   He found himself getting tired more easilythan was formerly the case.   He knew also that itwas right that a new leader of the Government should occupy his post for at least two years before aGeneral Election.   Nevertheless now that the momenthad. come he found it hard to part with his colleagues .They had fought together in a good cause, often in circumstances of the utmost d.if f ieulty.   As aGovernment, they had. had their ups and downs, andthat was true of himself also.   All this he could never forget.    One cause of regret was to leave hisyounger colleagues, and he v:ould watch their careerswith special interest.    He thought, this had been rather a remarkable Government.    He shared to thefull Mr Chamber1ain&apos;s observations on the lord president&apos;s   courage and patriotic attitude in 1931.It had not been possible to avoid., feeling some uncertainty as to what the future of the cabinet would be at that time, but in the event he thoughtthat no Cabinet had ever pulled together better.He himself h-^d. worked for four years a.s a right-handman of Mr Ramsay Macuonald as Prime Minister, andhe had never had a colleague with whom he had worked better.   This was largely due to the complete
confidence that Mr MacDonald had placed in him fromthe first.    He felt it was rather hard that he himself was going out of office in fairly goodhealth, though admittedly tired,, while Mr MacDonaldhad a year or so before suffered a good deal in health from, the terrible strain of the four years during which he had. been Prime Minister.    In conclu-sion he said, that he was net in future going tointerfere in any way with the Government.   He intended.to make no political speeches in the present year.He felt, however, that he still had some good workhe hopedin him and/that his services to the State would, not entirely  cease, though he could, not tell what form.they would take.   He thanked all his  colleagues verywarmly for their continuous support.Mr Runciman asked to say a very few   words .No-one could, have lived as a member of the Cabinetduring the last few years without abiding impressionsand ineffaceable memories.   He could only say to all his colleagues  &quot;God bless you? &quot; .2, Whit ehal1 Gard ens, S.W.1,May 26,  193 7.
