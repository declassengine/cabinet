SPAIN. The Cabinet met, as a matter of urgency, to protection consider the situation which had arisen at Bilbaoof british shipping. and on the north coast of Spain as to the protectionof British shipping.    They had before them the(previous reference: following documents:-Cabinet 14(37), Con- The Conclusions of the Committee onelusion 3.) the Protection of British Shipping(Spain) dated 7th April, 1937FR. 10(37)2.. (M.R. S. (37) First Meeting):Foreign Office Telegram from Sir H.Chilten, No. 87, dated 7th April, 1937:See I   Foreign Office Telegram to Sir H-Chilton,Apnendix I     No.  106, dated 8th April, 1937:A Telegram from H.M. S. BLANCHE, dated10th April, 1937.In the course of the discussion the Cabinet were informed that a communication had been received bythe Admiralty to the effect that the Spanish naval authorities had suggested to the British Senior naval officer that arrangements might be made, subject to confirmation by General Franco, for British merchant ships to enter BilSao^in^baliast for the purpose ofloading cargoes of mineral ore, provided that theBritish Naval Authoiities could give an assurancein each case that these ships were not carryingcargo to Bilbao.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs beganby drawing the attention of the Cabinet to theMinutes of the Meeting of the Cabinet Committee heldon the 7th April (M.R.S.  (37), 1st Meeting), referredto above, and to the instructions that had been given as a result?to His Majesty&quot; s Ambassador at Hendayethat a responsible messenger should be sent,as bearerof the despatch appended to those Minutes, to general franco.    In the event the messe-nger had never beensent, for the reason that at the same moment at which
Taking first the question of oui legal rights in territorial waters in the conditions prevailing onthe Spanish coast, the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs said that he had been informed by theForeign Office Legal Advisers that there were twooonflicting views.   One view was that there was no difference between water and land.    Whoever was in control of the water had as much control as he whocontrolled the land.    If this view were correct, wehad no more right to interfere with General Franco&apos;sde facto control of territorial waters than we wouldhave to interfere on land.    The second view was that-2-he had received the message from the Secretary.ofState for Foreign Affairs, the Ambassador hadthereceived / message from H.M.S. BLANCHE referred toabove.On the previous morning, namely, Saturday,April 10th, the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, the First Lord of the Admiralty and thePresident of the Board of Trade, had held a meetingat which the following provisional steps had beenagreed to:-(l) The President of the Board of Tradewas to do his best to stop ships onvoyage to Bilbao entering the port:(2) The First Lord of the Admiralty wasto instruct H.M. S. HOOD to proceedfrom Gibraltar to somewhere in theneighbourhood of Bilbao, in order thatthe British forces in that regionmight not be inferior to those ofGeneral Franco. With the same objectan      8-inch gun Cruiser had previously been sent:(3) His Majesty1s Ambassador at Hendayehad been advised that the whole situation would be considered on sunday by Ministers;    that in the meanwhile British ships destined for Bilbao were being advised toproceed temporarily to St.  Jean de Luz(P.0. Telegram No. 109 of April 10th).
he who held the land also held the water.    If that view were correct, the only authority entitled to take steps to protect our shipping was the Basque Govern-inent.    In that event we could interfere only on theground that the Basque Government was not in aposition to protect our shipping.At Bilhao, in view/( of the strength of General Franco&apos;s forces there wasa reasonable certainty of interference with any shipattempting to enter.    This, however, did not applyto the coast as a whole.    That afternoon he had hada telephonic conversation with His Majesty1s ambassador at Hendaye, who informed him that no ships were now proceeding to Bilhao hut that they were still proceed-ing freely to Santander, and that communication byroad, and probably by rail, was open between Santander- and Bilbao.    He had added that Bilbao was being bombeddaily.    As regards the military prospects the ambassador had said that a reliable forecast wasimpossible.    He did not think the port was likely to fall at any rate ior a week or ten days, and theperiod night be longer, or it might not fall at all.Two main courses were open:    either -(l) To advise British shipping not toproceed to Bilbao owing to(a) bombing;(b) a blockade which, even thoughpo-rhafr&amp; not legal, was beingenforced - an enforcementresistance to which involvedinterference in Spanish terri-torial waters in circumstances inwhich international lav/ was not clear.The objection to this course was that, apajt fromits effect on the minds of shipowners, no british ships could proceed to Bilbao, and no ore could beobtained, unless it was possible to arrange for themto proceed there in ballast.    In addition, we shouldbe accused of giving way to General Franco, and an awkward precedent might be created at&apos; other ports-3-
afterwards.    Shipowners might well claim that if notcarrying contraband they ought to be allowed to enter the port in the course of a perfectly legitimatetrade.(2) We night fight our way into the port,refuse to admit that the blockade waslegal where British interests were concerned, insist on getting our iron ore, and state that for humanitarian. reasons we were not prepared to admit the blockade.By adopting this course we should check general franco&apos;s increasing demands.    Aeainst this course,however, there were three main objections:    first,it could be argued that our action would amount toBritish intervention and the frustration of an act ofwar;    second, it would endanger any agreement andembitter relations with General Franco;    and, third,that our ships, both warships and merchant vessels,would be liable to be bombed while in the port.In these circumstances the Secretary of State had tried to find an intermediate course to the following effect:-Firstly, that we should not admit the blockade and should impress on General Franco that we had never recognised either party as possessing belligerentrights:Secondly, that we should make clear that we cannotadmit or tolerate any interference with our ships at sea   though it would be better not to specifywhether this applied to th? high seas only or toterritorial waters also, although at present ourpractice was that we were not escorting our ships in territorial waters, and on account of the risk involvedwe did not wish to depart from this practice:Thirdly, as the merchant ships in question hadalready started and had got as far as St. Jean deLuz, we could not, either&apos; as a practical measure or
compatibly with our own dignity, instruct them toreturn home after much useless expenditure:Fourthly, we should announce that at the sametime, in view of the special local conditions prevailing at Bilbao, it was our intention to divertthe ships to Santander, where we took it for granted,but should be glad of an assurance, that there wouldbe no interference with them:Fifthly, we might then send the ships in ballastfrom Santander to Bilbao and should seek an assurance that not only would no obstacle be put in the way oftheir loading iron ore, but that every facilitypossible by the investing forces would be accorded to them:Sixthly, that this message should be conveyed toGeneral Franco by His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Hendayethrough the former&apos;s representative, together with a warning that this very reasonable course was the only way of avoiding grave trouble.    This might well induceGeneral Franco to accept the solution, particularly ifSeventhly,wo accompanied the warning by an intimation that we were ready to discuss future arrangements.
The President of the Board of Trade said thatwe had no legal right to compel British ships to avoidcertain ports.     The owners of British ships already in Spanish waters or proceeding thereto had alreadyincurred a liability in respect of the cargo, as it wasunusual for the charter party to contain a diversionclause.     Consequently, the shipowners could not take their cargo to another port without incurringliabilities.     He would expect that British shipownerswere likely to protest that they had every expectation of Naval protection.     At the same time, the president said that up to the present time those owners with whom he had been able to communicate had adopted theadvice of the Board of Trade though they would expectnot to be bullied out of their traffic by general franco,The Lord Chancellor pointed out that ships were bound to go only as near to a port as they could safely get.      It was pointed out, however, that thiswas generally assumed to apply to physical conditions.The First Lord of the Admiralty suggestedthat the question of diversion of ships and compensationtherefor was a secondary issue *     If the suggestion ofthe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was accepted, questions of compensation or otherwise mighthave to be considered later.     For example, it mightbe possible to include a sentence in the Order inCouncil adding to the list of goods that British ships were not to carry to Spain a new category, namely foodstuffs, but applying only to the particular port of BilbaoOn the main issue, we had tried to hold to the position that we should protect British shipping on the high seasbut not in territorial waters.     Now, however, General- 6 -
Franco had challenged it.     Information of thatchallenge had not been available to the CabinetCommittee at the meeting on the 7th April.     The,more the matter was considered, the more difficultdid the attempt to hold to the original positionappear. .   The&apos; Chief of the Naval Staff urgedstrong objections against the policy of protectingour shipping up to the edge of Spanish territorial waters and then allowing-&apos; ships to. enter them andbe captured within sight of their escorts.     Thatwould be bad for the prestige of the Navy.    &apos; Inview of General FrancoTs challenge, therefore, itwas difficult to continue the differentiation between the high seas and&apos; territorial waters.Owing to General Francors challenge, diversion of&apos;ships from Bilbao gave an impression of giving way,but the alternative of using the Navy to force anentry into Bilbao would raise grave issues.     Theestablishment at Bilbao of an effective blockadeby General Franco&apos;s forces created a new situation,. since this was the first occasion in the war when there had &quot;been an effective blockade of a port by sea and land.     Off Bilbao, the insurgents now hadone new battleship armed with IS-inch guns, a moderncruiser, a light cruiser and a destroyer as well as-as? armed trawlers.   In view of General Franco &apos;sthreat, he and the Chief of the Naval Staff had decided that it would be advisable that the british navy in that region should be of overwhelmingstrengths       x. First, H.M.S. Shropshire, an 8-inch cruiser and now H.M.S. Hood were being sent there.He assured the Cabinet that there was no doubt thatwe should possess overwhelming strength so that whatever decision the Cabinet might reach, it wouldbe based on strength and not on weakness.     The- 7 -
British ships on voyage to Bilhao were mostly ?fsmall tonnage and one or two had been transferredrecently from foreign flags.     One of the ships was reported by the General Staff to be carrying munitionsclandestinely.     Some Scandinavian Governments alreadywished to place their ships bound for Spain underarmed protection.     If we were to start givingprotection, we should get many such requests,     Aserious point which ought to be considered by theCabinet was, he said, the effect of any decision on non-intervention policy.     Admittedly, theInternational non-intervention policy applied only to munitions of war.     But if we were to interfere at abeleaguered port, it would be interpreted as takingsides and this might provoke Germany and Italy tobreak away from non-intervention.     He himself had no desire that General Franco - or the other side - shouldwin, but he did not want to appear as a protagonistagainst General FrancoP if only for the reason thatthe insurgents held the part of Spain in which thiscountry was more especailly interested.     He believedthat General Franco was anxious to avoid antagonisingus.     This view was borne out by the apology offeredat Palma for the bombing of a British destroyer.Even in the present case, there was evidence thatGeneral Franco wished to avoid a clash and here be referred to the telegram, referred to above,announcing a communication from the Spanish to theBritish Naval authorities.     He urged, therefore,that in order to keep non-intervention alive, it was important to avoid an incident.     Our aim should be toplay for time,to see whether General Franco found it possible to maintain the blockade effectively and,within the next few days, to avoid any action that couldbe interpreted as intervention by forcing our food shipsinto Bilbao.     He contemplated that in the event of acorresponding, situation arising at some port where the positions of contending parties were reversed, our policy should be the same.     Our object always being to- 8 -
to avoid an incident that would &quot;break up the policynon-intervention.The Chancellor of the Exchequer reminded theCabinet that there were two cases to consider:(l) that of particular ships now on their way to Bilbao;(ii) the general policy as to ships not yeton their way.Some of the proposals before the Cabinet dealt with thefirst case and some with the second.      The latter was themore important,  and if that could be decided the firstcase could be settled on the same lines.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said thatat the moment he was aiming at a day to day arrangement.He was disturbed at the fact reported in the telegram .fromthe Senior Naval Officer that the Spanish naval authorities classed Santander with Bilbao as regards the entry of British ships in ballast, as it seemed to point to a doubt whether General Franco would allow Britishfood ships to proceed to Santander,      If General FrancoaauA^ aJ - fLcAx^ rh-^f. km^cwould accept this then he would inotru^%- all- Bri-^efe-efea^s to go to SantanderoThe Minister for Co-ordination of Defence doubted whether General Franco would allow Santander as a substitute for Bilbao.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointedout that General Franco was not in a position to make theblockade effective at Santander.The Lord Privy Seal asked whether it would not bepossible whenever a blockade was        effective as atBilbao to recognise belligerent rights locally in respectof that blockade.      That would clear up the difficulty as
to   international law.      He agreed that it was illogicalin present circumstances to try and maintain the distinction between bhe protection of ships in territorial and non-territorial waters:    that was why he suggested the principle of a local grant of belligerent rights.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs recalledthe circumstances of the decision not to grant belligerentrights to either side.      No nation had yet granted thoserights except Germany and Italy who had both given full recognition to General Franco.      If we were now to grantbelligerent rights even locally it would be urged as an act favouring General Franco.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out thatan agreement might be reached with General Franco withoutgranting belligerent rights.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence suggested as a possible course to tell General Franco that we didnot recognise his blockade as legal, but that we proposedto inform British shipping that a de facto blockadeexisted.      There had been a precedent for this action inthe case of a Chilean revolution in about 1860-70.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read a communication he had received as to the attitude of theFrench Government, which was to the effect that inprinciple the blockade was inadmissible:    that in practicethey would protect their shipping on the high seas, butthat this was more doubtful as regards territorial waters.Generally speaking, they would follow British practice.
The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the french attitude was not important as no French ships were proceeding to the North Spanish portsoThe Home Secretary suggested that a basis mightbe found for an arrangement with General Franco, underwhich we should undertake that if General Franco wouldadmit our ships in ballast to Bilbao and Santander we should agree that where     a de facto blockade had been establishedwe would advise our nationals not to send their ships.We should do this, however, without recognisingbelligerent rights.The President of the Board of Trade said that outof six British ships at Sto Jean de Luz^four were aaat mballast and could not go to Bilbao under any sucharrangemento      One contained food and the last was suspected of containing munitions of war,which might betaken to some British port for examination,.     Probablythere were three more ships in voyage to the Spanishcoast.-11-
The Minister for Oo-ordination of Defence urged the importance of keeping Bilhao open for obtainingiron ore, which was much needed in this country.In the course of the discussion most of theproposals for dealing with this question were foundopen to objections from one point of view or another.The Naval objection to continuing at a blockadedport the policy of protecting British shippingoutside, but not inside, territorial waters, met with much sympathy.    It was suggested, however, that thiscreated a new situation which virtually compelled usto protect British ships both on the high seas and in territorial waters, or in neither.The possible course of compelling the insurgentforces to admit British food ships met with little or no support, though it was pointed out that general franco was unlikely to jeopardize his ships by resist-anoe to a well-supported demand.    The probable conse-quences on the international policy of non-intervention,however, were generally conceded to rule out thiscourse.    The contention was felt to be valid that,incases where a port or district was beleaguered by land and effectively blockaded by sea, action to enforce the admission of British food ships might w&apos;-.ll be interpreted in some quarters as tantamount to inter-vention.One suggestion was that British merchant shipsmight be warned against proceeding to Bilbao owing tothe dangers from submarine mines and air bombing,against which no protection could be offered by theNavy.    From a Parliamentary point of view this courseoffered attractions, because it would avoid any. appar-ent yielding to General Franco&apos;s demands.    against this, however, two objections were urged:   eitherBritish ships in ballast would be deterred, even though-12-
permitted, from going to Bilbao for mineral ore, or,alternatively, their owners might decide to run therisk and it might be shown in practice that the warning had been totally unfounded.    It was thoughtbetter that the warning, if it were issued, shouldbe based more broadly on the general conditions exist-ing at Bilbao today.    Such a warning was compared toa storm warning:    a battle was going on at Bilbaoand it was obviously dangerous to enter a battle area,which might even extend beyond the three-mile limit.A warning on these grounds could be accompanied bya statement that, so far as our information went,Santander was not yet a battle area.In connection with the proposal to advise british shipping to proceed to Santander instead of Bilbao,the First Lord of the Admiralty informed his colleagues that a telegram had been received indicating that mines were being laid at various places along the Spanishcoast, including probably Santander-.While the use of Santander was favoured, it was recognised that, before a final decision could betaken, further technical information would be requiredwhich the Foreign Office and Admiralty were asked toobtain.    It was felt that anything in the nature of anagreement with General Franco as between equals wouldbe difficult to defend in Parliament, and from thispoint of view it was thought better to notify General/Franco of our intention to 4i-v-o-rty British ships/to /o^oa^ti/othe port of Santander and that we assumed there wouldbe no interference with them.While it was recognised that British ships couldnot be compelled to desist from proceeding on theirvoyage, whether to Bilbao or Santander, it was feltthat if they were warned against such voyages they
were not entitled to protection and should be given tounderstand that they undertook the voyage at theirrisk.    In the case of Bilbao the British ships shouldbe warned that this was the case, and the naval authorities should be instructed to withdraw protection from British merchant ships which disregarded the wishes of His Majesty&apos;s Government that they should not proceedto that area, and that British merchant ships should beso informed.as regards Santander, no final decision wasreached.    It was felt that the British Naval Authori-ties should continue to dissuade ships from proceeding to that port, though in that case they should notwithhold protection if they insisted on proceeding.General Franco, it was recognised, might at firstrefuse to admit food ships to Santander, but it waspointed out that he had probably not the naval forces available to make blockade effective at both portssimultaneously.With a view to clearing up the position as regardsthe entry of British ships to the Bilbao area in ballast and their loading mineral for export, it wasdecided that enquiry should be made, through his majesty s Ambassador at Hendaye, as to general franco&apos;s attitude, and it was suggested that in themeantime no further discussion should take place onthe subject between the British Senior Naval officer and the Spanish Naval Authorities pending further instructions.
The Cabinet agreed:(a) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should transmit immediatelythrough the appropriate channel toGeneral Franco&apos;s Government a writtencommunication to the following effect -&quot;We cannot recognise or concedebelligerent rights and we cannottolerate any interference with british shipping at sea.     We are,however, advising our shipping that,in view of the conditions at presentprevailing in the neighbourhood ofBilbao, they should not go into that area so long as these conditionscontinue.&quot;(b) That the above written communication should be accompanied by verbalcommunications to the following effect -(l)    His Majesty&apos;s Government assume that if British ships go toSantander there will be no interference with them.     If this is so the owners of the. ships atpresent awaiting orders will be told that they may send them to Santander,if they wish, and shipowners willbe informed that other vesselsdestined for Bilbao may be diverted to Santander if desired:(ii)    To enable His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto answer any questions that maybe asked of them by our Nationals,they desire to know what would bethe attitude of General Francotowards ships entering the Bilbaoarea in ballast and loading mineralfor export.(c) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should transmit immediately acopy of the telegram or telegrams sentin&apos;pursuance of (a) and (b) above tothe First Lord Of the Admiralty so as toenable him to inform the Naval authorities on the Spanish coast of the instructions issued by the Foreign Office.(d) That the First Lord of the Admiralty,besides notifying the Naval authorities on the Spanish coast of the instructions issued by the Foreign Office,should instructthem that all Naval protection is to be withdrawn from British merchant ships whichdisregard the wishes of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment that they should not proceed tothe Bilbao area and that British merchant ships should be so informed if the occasion arises:   also he should inform the Naval
authorities that as regards Santandera final decision has not yet been taken and that he should continue to dissuadeships from proceeding to that port hutshould afford them Naval protection onthe same basis as hitherto,)    That the President of the Board of trade should give appropriate warning toBritish shipowners in accordance with theinstructions issued by the ForeignOffice and the Admiralty in accordance withthe above decisions.)    That, in order to enable a final decisionto be taken as regards Santander, thefo3.1owing steps should be taken -(i)   The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs   should request HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador at Hendaye tosend information as to theconditions in or near the harbour at Santander and more especially as to whether the approaches aremined and to what extent thisconstitutes a danger to shipping.He should ask if Santander is subject to insurgent bombardmentfrom land or air:(ii)    The First Lord of the admiralty should send a correspondingmessage to the Naval authorities onthe Spanish coast,)    That, in the event of the matter being-raised in Parliament,  the Prime Minister(in the absence of the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs who had an importantengagement in the provinces) should makea statement on the lines of conclusion (a)above.Copies of telegrams sent in accordancewith the above Conclusions are attached as Appendix II.)
APPENDIX    I.(i)Decypher, Sir H.  Chi It on (Hendaye).7th April,  1937.D.      6,00 p.m. ,  7th April,  1937,Re      6,55 p0m.,  7th April,  1937.No.  87.IMPORTANT.Please see Senior Naval Officer&apos;s signals ending withhis number 2200/6 to Admiralty regarding incident involvingThorp Hall.      Owing probably to advice which Senior NavalOffieer thinks German man-of-war may have given insurgentcruisers (but which may not always be given or taken)yesterday&apos;s affair ended successfully;    but this type ofemergency is likely to recur at any moment and to become increasingly dangerous.Bilbao is now effectively blockaded by one battleship,cruiser, light cruiser and destroyer plus armed trawler,  aliof which operate outside territorial waters more especially as the harbour entrance is fortified-     Under presentinstructions British vessels entering or leaving Bilbao mustbe protected by His Majesty1s Ships from this blockade whenoutside three mile limit.      This involves escorting themand in order to do so properly and to be prepared to meetforce with force Senior Naval Officer reckons that considerablereinforcements to his present effective strength would berequired.     Such numbers could&quot; not, however, be accommodatedon this coast.      It follows therefore that policy of protectionof British shipping on high seas cannot be carried on in presentcircumstances affecting Bilbao.
Senior Naval Officer therefore suggests and I recommendthat British shipping he warned that so long as port of Bilbaois effectively closed as at present His Majesty&apos;s Ships cannotprotect them whatever their cargo from consequence of trying to run the blockade.      I realise that this would be tantamount to agreeing to insurgents&apos; exercise of belligerent rights,but such rights are already being effectively used by aconsiderable naval force such as circumstances unluckily prevent us from meeting, and further warning to insurgents would therefore appear to be an undesirable bluff.
APPENDIX    I..(ii)Cypher telegram to Sir H. Chilton (Hendaye).Foreign Office.      8th April, 1937.      10.30 p.m.No. 106.Your telegram No.  87.Question was discussed yesterday by Cabinet committee as a result of which following action has been taken.(l)   Admiralty have informed Commander-in-Ghief that existing naval instructions stand, namely:-   protection tobe given to British ships on the high seas, but not in territorial waters.     His Majesty&apos;s ships are not howeverexpected to engage forces in greatly superior strength orbeyond what might reasonably be expected of them in war..(2)    Board of Trade are sending private warning to ship-owners that owing to military operations, theneighbourhood of the Basgue coast particularly off Bilbaois especially dangerous at present for shipping.2.      Effect of the above is that we will continue to resist interference on the high seas with force ifnecessary provided it is physically possible.      As anadditional deterrent to General Franco the Admiralty havedecided to send an 8&quot; gun cruiser to the Basque coast,based on La Rochelle but maintaining close contact withthe destroyers.     We are further endeavouring by ournotice to shipowners to prevent the case arising.3*     At the same time as regards action in territorial waters, the Committee did not feel prepared either on theone hand publicly to admit that the Navy will not interfere in Spanish waters to protect British ships approaching
Bilbao, or on the other hand to convoy British shippingthrough Spanish waters.      The first course might mean thatBritish ships could no longer carry from Bilbao and otherBasque ports cargoes of iron-ore which are urgently needed inthis country.      It would also be equivalent to an invitation to General Franco to capture British ships as soon as theyenter the three mile limit.     The second course could not bejustified legally if it came to a dispute.4*      Position therefore is somewhat complicated and committee consider that it could best be straightened out bya personal visit cf one of your staff,  e.g.  Mr, Pack, toSalamanca for purpose of endeavouring to reach modus Vivendiwith the insurgent authorities on the whole question.      Theline which the messenger should take is as follows.-(i)   The general attitude of His Majesty&apos;s government towards treatment of British ships is as set out in mydespatch No.  333 which should be read out to and summarised in writing for the use of the insurgent authorities.      this attitude is an integral part and an inescapable result of thepolicy of non-intervention and of non-recogniition of belligerent rights which His Majesty&apos;s Government and allother European Governments have adopted since the outbreak ofthe war and which has resulted in at least as great advantaget6 the insurgent Government as to their opponents.     Inparticular it will be recalled that at the outset of the war when the Spanish Government had control of SpanishMediterranean waters, this policy enabled His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to give protection to British trade with allSpanish ports, including those under General Franco&apos;s control.Further the fact should he noted that without any action on
their part and without any risk of conflict v/ith HisMajesty&apos;s Government, the insurgents have been and are assured that arms and war material cannot reach the SpanishGovernment in British ships,(ii)   His Majesty1s Government therefore feel justified in asking the insurgent authorities to assist themin maintaining this attitude by once more reaffirmingthe instructions which they have already, on several occasions,  issued to their warships not to interfere with british shipping to Spain.      Only by this means can therisk be avoided of serious incidents between British andinsurgent warships which could only have the most dangerousresults on the relations between His Majesty&apos;s Government andthe insurgent authorities.(iii)   The situation at Bilbao is somewhat exeptional and the insurgent authorities may insist that their closeinvestment of the town justifies them in refusing topermit supplies of any sort from reaching it by sea.     Theymay argue that at any rate in territorial waters HisMajesty&apos;s Government have no right to force British shipsthrough.     The messenger can reply that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment do not admit the authority of the insurgentsto exercise belligerent rights - e.g. to blockade a port -either on the high seas or elsewhere, but that he has noinstructions as to whether they would prevent auch action by force in territorial waters.      If further pressed he mustrepeat that he has no instructions regarding territorial waters and must refer back to his Government.
