1,    The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported for information that a well-known Americanjournalist at present in London had called at his office and was to see him personally the same afternoon to make representations regarding theserious situation in Germany and to urge that aConference should he called in London to considerthe position.,    Cnly eight days ago he himself hadbeen in personal touch at Geneva with the german foreign Minister, who had made no suggestion as tothe need of a Conference.   Fe was consulting theBritish Ambassador in Berlin as to whether thework done at the Council of the League of nations had made any difference to the German situation.The Cabinet took note of theabove statement .
2.    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsfC.&quot;P.&quot;36 (31)) on the subject o^ the &quot;DisarmamentConference which the Council of the League ofNations has decided should meet at the beginningof February,. 1932.    In this Memorandum theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs suggestedthat a Committee of the Cabinet should immediately be appointed to direct the work and that represent-atlves of the other political Parties should beinvited to associate themselves with thisCommittee with a view to their taking part in thework of the Conference and bearing their share inthe responsibility from the beginning.There was general agreement that a CabinetCommittee should be set up at once as a. nucleusfor the machinery of preparation for the f-isar-ra-;rent Conference, tut the proposal to associateother political Parties with this Committee gave rise to a number of questions, including thefoilowing:-Was it wise to invite the co-operation ofthe other Parties in view of the desire of the Government to give a pronouncedlead in the matter of disarmament?If, however,  it were desired to co-operate with the other political Parties, should they be invited in the first instance to associate themselves in the work of preparation only^ or? in addition, tobe represented in a Delegation represen-tative of all Parties at the Conference?Or, alternatively, would it not be wiserfor the Cabinet to determine their own
policy before making any approach tothe other Parties?If the other Parties were associatedwith the work of the Committee, would it not also be necessary to give theDominions and India an opportunity to associate themselves with the work-  from the outset, notwithstanding thatthey themselves would be representedindependently On the T^isarmamentCommittee?    Or,  alternatively, would it be sufficient at first to keep theDominions and India informed and tobring them into consultation at a later stage?    Some form of consultation withthe Dominions and India before theDisarmament Conference, however, was recognised to be necessary, owing to .the fact that,  especially so far asNaval armaments are concerned, theUnited Kingdom and the Dominionsand India form internationally asingle unit.After considerable discussion, the cabinet agreed &apos; (a) That a Cabinet Committee,  composed as follows -The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs (In the Chair),The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs,The Secretary of State for War,The Secretary of State for Air,The First Lord of the Admiralty,Sir Maurice Hankey (Secretary) -should be appointed with thefollowing merms of Reference:-
1. To advise the Cabinet as to thepolicy to be adopted at theooming Disarmament Conferenceand to direct in all its aspectsthe work of preparation.2* At such stage and to such extent as they deem appropriate, to consult with representatives ofthe other Parliamentary Parties,provided that the Leaders of thoseParties accept the invitation to nominate representatives.3 e At such stage as they may deemappropriate, and before submit-ting their proposals to theCabinet,to consult the Dominions and Indiathrough such channels as may bearranged and preferably through their representatives in London,(b) That the Prime Minister should see theLeaders of the other Parties in orderto explain to them the project)proposals ofthe Cabinet, and should invite themto nominate representatives to consult with the Cabinet Committee,,promising access to all necessaryPapers.,   He should intimate that if agreement could be reached at these consultations the Government would propose the formation of a delegation at the Disarmament Conference repre-tentative of all three Parties, whichcould speak with a national voice:(c) That the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs should at onceinform the Prime Ministers of theDominions of the above procedure:(d) That the Secretary of State forIndia should make such communica-tion to the Viceroy as he might-deem appropriate:(e) That members of the Cabinet shouldscrutinise carefully the above draft conclusions and at once notify theSecretary of any observations theymay have to -&apos;;ake,  in order that thePrime Minister may be in a positionto discuss the matter with the Leadersof the othe-&quot; Parties before the endof the present week.

In accordance with Conclusion 4 of the Cabinet on 20thJanuary,  (Cab.  10 (31)) the Chancellor of the Exchequer,the President of the Board of Trade and I have considered further the proposition for alleviating the position ofthe beet sugar industry,  and have met representatives ofthe beet sugar factories.2.      We consider that a case for some measure of further assistance has been made out, and that the principlesthat should apply are as follows(i) All parties,  i.e.  the factories, the farmers and theState to make some sacrifice,(ii) The larger factories to receive proportionately lessassistance than the smaller,(iii) Although the Government should avoid taking any responsibility for a definite figure the assistance should be such as will enable most factories to offerfarmers 45/6d. per ton of beet (17^% sugar) as comparedwith the farmers&apos;  demand of 46/Od.(iV) The price offered to farmers should be such as torequire from the majority of factories a maximumsacrifice of provision for depreciation and other-capital charges, profit and additions to reserves.
(v) The assistance should be recoverable from, the     -factories during the last two years of theSubsidy Act, according to the factories&apos;capacity to repay judged in relation to sugarprices.3.    - , The amount of the assistance should be limited to an extra subsidy of l/3d. per cwt.  of sugar, payable only, oin respect of the first 300,000 cwts.  of sugar (ex.  98polarisation) manufactured in each factory in 1931-2.The maximum benefit from this method will accrue toasthe 11 smaller factories with an aggregate output not expected to exceed 3 million cwts.The remaining 7 larger factories would benefit onlyin respect of the first 300,000 cwts.  of sugar manufactured in each factory, the balance of their output receivingsubsidy only at the normal rate.4. The maximum sum for which the Exchequer would be liablewould be  318,750.      This amount is^about  56,000 lessthan the sum which would be payable were a flat rate ofl/3d.  per cwt.  of sugar applied to the estimated total output of all the factories.5, This proposal represents, moreover, a saving of  276,000upon the original proposal for an extra subsidy of 2/-per cwt., which, however,  allowed the factories to makea limited provision for depreciation or debenture interest.6c Y/e suggest that the following conditions of theassistance should be laid down:-(i) All beet contracts offered by farmers to be acceptedby factories up to their throughput capacity.This is to ensure that no factory shall limit- itscontracts for beet to the amount in respect of which itwould secure the extra sugar subsidy.x .One of these factories has only a small throughput of sugar beet.
(ii) The extra assistance to be contingent upon theprice of sugar during the 1931/2 manufacturing campaign,that is to say,  if the price of sugar rises above theprice (i,e,  7/- per ewt.  - ex.  duty) which is the basis on which the present discussions have been cohducted,the amount of extra assistance shall be abated by theamount of the rise in sugar prices.The precise method of application of this condition requires further examination in consultationwith the industry.(iii) The cost of the extra subsidy to be recoverablefrom the factories during the last two years of operationof the present Subsidy Act.The extra subsidy in effect guarantees to factories a price of 8/3d. per cwt.  ex.  duty.      the factories are to be entitled in the last two years tomake, if they can, limited provision for depreciation ordebenture interest before incurring liability for repayment.Assuming that lid. per cwt., of sugar or thereaboutsis a limited average provision for this purpose, theGovernment should recover the extra subsidy from theseveral factories when and only to the extent that theprice of sugar exceeds 9/2d. per cwt.      The repaymentwould be secured by deduction from the normal subsidypayable under the existing Act.I accordingly submit the above proposals for the approvalof my colleagues and ask for their authority to announcethem to the industry as being the maximum assistance thatthe Government is prepared to offer.(Intld. ) G.A.of Agriculture and Fisheries.February, 1931.
(ii) The extra assistance to be contingent upon theprice of sugar during the 1931/3 manufacturing campaign,that is to say,  if the price of sugar rises above theprice (i.e.  7/- per cwt.  - ex.   duty) which is the basis on which the present discussions have been conducted,the amount of extra assistance shall be abated by theamount of the rise in sugar prices.The precise method of application of this condition requires further examination in consultationwith the industry.(iii) The cost of the extra subsidy to be recoverablefrom the factories during the last two years of operationof the present Subsidy Act.The extra subsidy in effect guarantees to factories a price of 8/3d. per cwt.  ex.  duty.      the factories are to be entitled in The last two years tomake, if they can, limited provision for depreciation ordebenture interest before incurring liability for repayment.Assuming that lid. per cwt.. of sugar or thereaboutsis a limited average provision for this purpose, theGovernment should recover the extra subsidy from theseveral factories when and only to the extent that theprice of sugar exceeds 9/3d. per cwt.      The repaymentwould be secured by deduction from the no rmal sub s i dypayable under the existing Act.&apos;I accordingly submit the above proposals for the approvalof my colleagues and ask for their authority to announcethem to the industry as being the maximum assistance thatthe Government is prepared to offer.(Intld.)
