1. The Prime Minister asked his colleagues tokeep under observation the proposed Customs arrange-ment between Germany and Austria.   He had asked the Foreign Office to prepare a statement, whichhe hoped would be circulated the same day.   Hethought it important that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United Kingdom should form their own policy on the proposal and not necessarily follow a Frenchlead.The President of the Board of Trade said thequestion was being examined carefully in its economic aspects.The Prime Minister said the question could notbe discussed in the absence of the Foreign Secretary,but he had thought it as well to mention it.
2. The Prime Minister welcomed to the cabinet for the first time the Minister of Transport andthe Lord Privy Seal.   He reminded his new colleagues that all the Papers circulated to the Cabinet were of the utmost secrecy.   He asked them to be particu-larly careful about the Secretaries and other persons to whom it might be necessary to show suchPapers, all of whom should be warned of theirsecrecy.    There were always people anxious to knowabort Cabinet business, and the most carefulprecautions were necessary.   Papers should&quot;&apos;be kept under lock and key and on no account foe allowed to lie about.
THE COALINDUSTRY.(PreviQusReference:Cabinet 18(31), Con-clusion 6.)2o(3i)i.3. The Cabinet had before them the following documents relating to the Coal Situation:-I. A Note by the President of theBoard of Trade (CP.-75 (31))covering Notes prepared in the mines Department on (i) TheIndustrial Position in the CoalMining Industry, and (ii) TheOperation of Part I of the CoalMines Act,  19 30.    The formercontained a brief historicalsummary of the statutoryrestrictions upon working hours in the coal industry.    It was shown that the present positionarose out of unexpected decisions reached at a Delegate Conferenceof the Miners * Federation heldon Thursday, March 19,  19 31(i) not to sanction any spread-over working after March 31;(Ii) to meet the Government and demand an immediate amendment ofthe Coal Mines Minimum Wage Act.1912, by the passing of Mr PottsTThe latter proposal was of acceptance,provides forthe variousall over theBilldeemed impossibleas Mr Potts 1 Billminimum wages forclasses of workmencountry alike at such rates as would (it is estimated) add 3/-to 4/6 per ton to the cost of coal.The Federation^ decision on the spread-over,  it was pointed out,means that those districts atpresent working on such agreements -will, after March 31st, either haveto change over to a 7^ hours day and accept considerable wage reduc-tions, or continue to work &quot;spread-overs&quot; without the authorisation ofthe Board of Trade and therefore in contravention of the law.   A de-lib er-ate renewal of illegal working atthis stage and on a large scalewould introduce a difficult problem,and the Government would have toconsider what action is to be taken if this happens as the result of theFederation^ recent decision.UnemploymentInsuranceBenefit .IT,In the Memorandum on the Operationof Part I of the Coal Mines Act,  1930,it was shown that there is no generalshort-age of coal and that suppliesfror: other coalfields are availableto meet practically all the isolatedcases of shortage that are occurring.A Memorandum by the Minister of Labour(C.P.-76 (31)) circulating a precisof the decisions given by the Umpireon claims to benefit made by workersin the South Wales and Scottishcoalfields in connection with the
stoppages which took plaoe in q,,those fields in January and oVDecember last respectively .In the case of the South Walesstoppage, benefit was disallowed,while in the case of the Scottishstoppage benefit was allowed.   Thereason for the difference betweenthe decisions in the two caseswas that while in both cases theoffer included working onspread-over, in the one case there was no alternative, while in the other there was an alter-native, which was an offer ofemployment on legal terms.It was pointed out that if theonly offer from employers was towork on a spread.-over basis,benefit would be payable if a stoppage follows, and the conse-quential charge on the UnemploymentInsurance Fund might be very largeindeed.The Secretary for Mines gave the cabinet particulars of the latest developments, and a discussion followed.The position before the Cabinet may be summarisedr.-3 foil _   .     ^. - -1* Tne immediate difficulty in the coal situation in Scotland.2. The President and the Secretary ofthe Scottish Mine-Workers&apos; Unionare in favour of working thesystem of the spread-over, whichis legalised until March&apos;31st,until the end of June, and areapplying to the Executive of theMiners&apos;  Federation to sanction it..3. The Executive of the Miners1 Federa-tion will be unable to sanction the jfproposal, not so much owing to itsown inolinatioris, but because aConference of the Federation has passed a vote by a two to onemajority against the Executivesanctioning any arrangement basedon the spread-over.4. If no spread-over is sanctionedthe owners are likely to postnotices for a 7-hours day atreduced wages in Scotland.    Inthat event there is some uncer-tainty as to what attitude theminers themselves would take.Some may wish to work a spread-over in accordance with the hewagreement. With the owners whichhas just been made, but miners who,refused to work under- thes&quot;e^ condi-tions, which, unless- sanctioned, areillegal, will be entitled&apos; to Unem-ployment Benefit, whilst&apos; those whowork will be liable to prosecution.&apos;
15. The President and Secretary of theScottish Mine-Workers&apos; Union have applied to the Government to legalise a spread-over arrangementafter March 31st until June 30th.This would involve legislation to enable the Board of Trade togive a certificate sanctioningthe spread-over without obtaining the authority of the Miners&apos;Federation and the Mining Associa-tion.    Such legislation wouldprobably be opposed by the Miners&apos;Members in the House.6. Failing a decision by the executive of the Miners&apos;  Federation to approvea spread-over arrangement  (which, asshown above,  is extremely unlikely)or legislation by the Government(which is open to political objec-tions) the Government are liable tobe faced in April with a situationin Scotland in which work is proceedingillegally.    Such a contravention of thelaw ought not to be tolerated,  except possibly very temporarily while apermanent settlement is being negotiated.7. A possible solution is to considerthe immediate situation in conjunctionwith the situation arising in July,when the 7^-hours day falls automaticallyto a 7-hours day on the expiration ofexisting legislation, with a view toa comprehensive settlement.8. The Cabinet were informed that a jointmeeting of the Miners&apos; Federation andthe Owners had been arranged to takeplace the same afternoon at 2-30 p.m.Until the result of that meeting was known it was felt that no decision could be reached.The Cabinet agreed  TO. meet the same evening at 9 p..m0,in the Prime Minister&apos;s Room at theHouse of Commons.
parliamentary business-.pr evi previous reference:Cabinet 18(31), Oon-clusion 4.)THE TOWN and country PLAN-NINO BILL.(previous reference:Cabinet 18(31), Con-elusion 4.)THE CONSUMERS&quot;COUNCIL BILL.&apos; previous reference:Cabinet 18(cl), Con-clusion 4.)f.K.4. The Prime Minister made a statement to theCabinet  on the subject of Parliamentary Business,arising more particularly from the insistence ofthe Conservative Opposition on moving a Vote of censure on Unemployment .During the discussion the Prime Minister receiveda note from the Parliamentary Secretary to theTreasury containing proposals for the parliamentary programme for next -week.Some discussion took place as to whether thetime available next week for new legislation shouldbe devoted to the Town and Country Planning bill or the Consumers * Council Bill.   As discussions were still taking place with the Liberal Leaders onthe former Bill it was decided to postpone SecondReading discussion until after Easter.    In orderto relieve the President of the Board of trade the First Lord of the Admiralty undertook to pilotthe Consumers&apos;  Council Bill through the StandingCommittee Stage,  and it was decided to introducethis Bill next week.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Prime Minister should offer the strongest opposition to theallotment of time to the Vote of censure, for which such short noticehad been given, but it was recognisedthat in the last resort the Oppositioncould insist on their Motion being 7taken:(b) That if the Vote of Censure debate should prove unavoidable, the time-table for the following week might-be as follows:-Monday, March 30th:Tuesday, March 31stThe Consumers&apos;Council Bill.The Vote of Censureand the Army AnnualBill.Wednesday, April 1st: The Speaker out ofthe Chair, and captain Gunston&apos;economy Motion.

5. The Cabinet had before them the Third Reportof the Cabinet Committee on the Economic consequences of Disarmament  &apos;C.P.-72 (31)) recommending theCabinet to approve the despatch by the Chairman ofthe Committee, to the Joint Disarmament Committeeof the Trades Union Council, of a letter attached in draft in the Appendix to the Report.    In this draft letter it was made clear, with full d&apos;etails,that the proposal of the Joint Disarmament Committeeto relieve distress in areas specially affected bythe disarmament policy, by giving special grants inon reliefaid of the extra expenditure/incurred by the LocalAuthorities, raised administrative difficulties of so serious a character that success must be regardedas highly problematical if not impossible.    Emphasiswas laid on the difficulty of applying a policy of discrimination in particular areas,  and some details were given of the numerous measures undertaken inthe past two years to deal with the problem ofunemployment as a whole, as a result of which,notwithstanding the severity of the trade depression,the well-being of the population has been main-tained in a degree which compares favourably withthe experience of any previous depression.The Cabinet approved the Report ofthe Cabinet Committee (CP.-72 (31))and left the date of the despatch ofthe letter in the Appendix to theSecretary of State for A&apos;ar, as chairman of ^he Cabinet Committee.The latter was given discretion toput it off for a few weeks if he deemed this course advisable afterconsultation with the Secretary ofthe Joint Disarmament Committee ofthe Parliamentary Labour Party, theGeneral Council of the Trade UnionCongress and the Executive Committeeof the National Labour Party.
^HE EXPORTCREDITSGUARANTEESCHEME.(previous reference:Cabinet 73(30), Oon-clas-ion 7 ..)a.6, The Home Secretary brought to the Cabinet, asa matter of urgency, a question of extending theExport Credits Scheme in respect of Messrs Platt &amp; Co.,Ltd., textile machinists, of Oldham, who are thelargest makers in the country of manufacturingmachinery and employ many thousands of workers.Latterly this firm had depended to a considerable extent upon orders from Russia, to whom they hadbeen in the habit of giving long credits, up to 5 years, for the last ten years, without government assistance.    The Soviet Government had invariablyhonoured its debts as they matured.   Now the firmwas not in a position to give these long credits .A Member of Parliament who was associated with the firm had intimated that they had in prospectconsiderable further orders from Soviet Russia,of from  1,000,000 to  5,000,000, but only if longcredits could be provided.    In the circumstancesenquiry had been made as to whether some extension,of the period for credit (l^ to 2 years) allowedunder the Export Credits Scheme could be sanctioned,with a view to averting the unemployment which wasotherwise almost certain to result from a failure to secure the orders.Further information was furnished to the Cabinetboth as to the position of the firm in the matterand as to the attitude of the Export Credits&apos; Department.The Cabinet agreed  That a Cabinet Committee, composed as follows -The Home Secretary (In the Chair),The President of the Board of Trade,The Lord Privy Seal -should meet to report generally onthe operation of the Export Credits
Scheme as affecting not only Russiabut other countries, with speeialreference to the case raised by theHome Secretary.    The Committee was asked to report at the earliestpossible date and, so far as theapplication from Messrs Platt was concerned,  not later than the next regular Meeting of the Cabinet on tuesday, MARCH 31st.-10-
TIN RESTRIC-TION.(previous reference:Cabinet 14(31),  Con-clusion 5.)7.The Cabinet had before them the followingthedocuments on the subject of/Tin Restriction Scheme:A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for the Colonies  (CP .-73(31)) bringing to notice a proposal by the Dutch delegates on the Inter-national Tin Restriction Committeedesigned to remove from the marketthe very large stocks of tin(estimated at over 50,000 tons)which have now accumulated.    Themethod by which this was to be accomplished was the formation ofa pool to remove stocks from themarket and hold them until prices have reached a given level, after which they would gradually be liquidated according to an agreedplan.    For this purpose an inter-national syndicate was to be formedwhich would, with the least possible delay, take a m:Lnimum of 20,000 tonsoff the market.    The scheme couldonly -be worked if the netherlands east Indies Government agreed tocome in, and they would not do sounless they knew that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment had no objection to it.The Nigerian Government could not afford to enter the scheme, and thequestion arose as to whether the malayan Government should be allowedto decide for itself.    On the whole the Secretary of State was in favourof declining to participate, whilstsaying to the promoters of the poolthat His Majesty&apos;s Government prefersto express no opinion as to theaction in the matter of private owners of tin:A second Memorandum by the Secretaryof State for the Colonies  (CP .-66(31))  circulating a copy of anofficial letter from the ColonialOffice to the Foreign Office con-taining the text of the Heads ofAgreement relating to the schemefor the regulation of the productionand export of tin which was recently-signed by the delegates of the four countries concerned.The Cabinet agreed - (a) To approve the attitude of the Secretaryof State for the Colonies towards theproposed pool to remove stocks of tinfrom the market:(b) To;take note of the Memorandum by theSecretary of State for the Colonies(CP.-68 (31)) .
THE PALESTINE-        8. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum byEAST AFRICALOANS GUARANTEE the Secretary of State for the Colonies  (CP.-42BILL.(31)), prepared in consultation with the Financial(Previous Secretary to the Treasury, raising as a matter ofReference:Cabinet 50       great urgency,  in view of the Easter Recess,  a(26),  Con-clusion 4.)      difficulty arising out of the Palestine-East AfricaLoans Act,  1Q26, which makes it desirable to amend the Act as soon as possible.   The difficulty was dueto the fact that Tanganyika was on the point of raising its second guaranteed loan under the Act of1926 and that the Act made no provision for securing that the charges under the first loan should have priority over the second.    It was therefore proposedto amend the Act by the insertion of a few words toprovide that the loan raised under the Act shouldhave priority over all charges other than those forloans previously issued under the Acttnot existingat the date, of the Act.The Secretary of State for the Colonies statedthat it was  just possible that the Legal Advisersmight succeed in finding a way out of the difficultywithout legislation.The Cabinet agreed  That the proposed Bill should be remitted to the Committee of HomeAffairs, which should be asked toconsider whether any way could befound for avoiding legislation.
THE POST OFFICEAND TELEGRAPHMONEY BILL.(previous reference:Cabinet 53(30), Con-c lus ion 1,)9. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Postmaster-General (C.P.-74 (31))  on thesubject of the Post Office and Telegraph Money bill of 1931.   The Bill would authorise the issue of 32,000,000, of which it was estimated that 29,200,000 would be required for the telephone service and  2,800,000 for the postal and telegraph services.   Added to the unexpended balance of 2,000,000 already available as at March 31,. 1931,.from the previous Act, this sum would meet thecapital requirements to March 31, 1934.The Cabinet approved the proposal of thePastmaster-General and agreed  That the Bill should be submittedto the Committee of Home Affairs.

Jtte wtdo&apos;^&apos; ,Orphans&apos; andIld age gon-jrxbutoryPensions bill\( previous&quot; Reference:Cabinet 17(31), Con-clusion 6.)12.The Cabinet had. before them the following documents on the subject of the Vvidows&apos; ,  Orphans&apos;and Old Age Contributory Pensions Bill:-A Memorandum by the minister er ofHealth (K.A.-13 (31)) covering the draft WidowsT, OrphansT  and old Age Contribu.tory pensions bill, prepared as the result ofthe Cabinet Conclusion referredto in the margin, together witha copy of a financial memorandum as to its provisions:A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState ^or Scotland (K.A.-14 (31))containing a suggestion for anadditional cla.use to the Bill,which, however, as the result ofa meeting of the &quot;Committee ofHome Affairs, he had decided notto press.The object of the first proposal in the Ministerof Health&apos;s Bill was to give effect to the intentionof the Contributory Pensions Act,  1929, viz., thatin determining the title to pension of a widow,  theincapacity of her husband for employment (throttghillness,   etc.) during the last three years of hisinsurable life, whether that incapacity was temporaryor permanent, should be disregarded.    The Courts,however, had interpreted the Act in a manner whichwould deny pensions to a large number of widows whowere intended to benefit, and sub-section 1 (a) ofthe Bill had been inserted to give effect to theoriginal intention.    The Minister&apos;s second proposal,which had not yet been submitted to the Cabinet,was to remedy a minor omission in the Act of 19 29.That Act had made no provision for the grant ofpensions to widows whose husbands, being over 70on July 15, 1912 (the date of the commencement ofNational Insurance), were unable to become insured.It was now proposed to grant pension in these cases,subject to the satisfaction of a normal occupationtest.
