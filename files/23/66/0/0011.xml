losrpHS SCHNEIDERTKOPHY.(previous reference;Cabinet 8(31), Con-clusion b) .31+ (33)1*.1,    The Prime Minister reported to the--Cahin.e&quot;that strong pressure was still being exerted inPasliament and in the press in.favour of british participation in the race for the Schneider CupTrophy.      Since the original decision of the Cabinettwo new factors had arisen;    first there was nolonger any doubt that the Royal Aero Club could find the money;    and second the aircraft constructionfirms represented that if the United Kingdomdid not take part in the race they would lose,probably to Italy,  (already a serious competitor), *large orders for re-conditioning&apos; ma chines abroadwhich otherwise they might expect to receive *      Hehad seen the Chief of the Air Staff and he gathered &apos;that he still opposed on merits the co-operationof the Royal Air Force,  if it could be avoided, in what had virtually become a competition betweenthe Governments of the countries taking part.His reasons were the same as those which had beensubmitted to the Cabinet by the late Lord Thomson.The Prime Minister added that several questions were being addressed to him on the subject inParliament..     He had asked for their postponementuntil the morrow, but it would then be necessaryto give a final answer as to the attitude of theGovernment.After discussion by the Cabinet, it wasagreed  That, the Secretary of State for Air&quot;and the^L^rd^P^i^^ea-1 should at onceproceed to the Air Ministry to take part in the consultation which theChief of the ^Ir Staff had arranged to have with the representatives of theaircraft construction firms, not onlyin order to ascertain at once from-1-
these firms whether it would,bepossible to provide the machinesin time for the race,  but also tolesrrn. their views as to theprobable effect on the industry ofparticipating or not participating,according as we might win or lose the race.(Theand the Secretary ofState for Air left the Cabinet meeting at about 11.0 a.m. and returned at about 12.50 p.The 6e-rd^^^j^v^%ea?i reported that he and theSecretary of State for Air had put a series of questions to the representatives of Rolls Royce andVickers in regard to the race,  for example, whateffect It would have on trade if the United Kingdomdid not enter;    what effect if the United Kingdomdid enter with a prospect of losing.      In addition the Chief of the Air Staff had put a number of technical questions as to the minimum time requiredto produce the engines by dates which would permit of training and so forth.      The replies had beenthat if it were decided to take part in the racewe were as far advanced in our preparations  to-dayas we were at the corresponding date in 19Sf,  owingto the fact that there was no necessity to design a new engine but only to develop an existing one.The manufacturers had satisfied the Ministers thatth^r-e-^wa-s^no^dou-b-t-4sha4i the machines could be ready.Hhe manufacturershad entertained no doubt whatsoever that from thebusiness point of view winning the race would bea tremendous asset.      They pointed out that on the3occasion of the race in 192J? the British machines
had had an advantage of 4-0 miles per hour over thebest of their rivals.      To this they hoped to add 15 m.p.h., making an advantage equal to55 m.p.h.     According to previous experience therehad been no greater advance from one race totherefore it would be very difficult for italy to overtake us, and the manufacturers thought wehad a good sporting chance of success.     After thewithdrawal of the representatives of the manufacturersthe Ministers had pressed the Chief of the AirStaff for his opinion, and he had said that on balance he was bound to come to the view thatwe ought to take part in the race.      He had added the suggestion that the announcement might with advantage be so worded as to show that wewere accepting some handicap owing to the latenessof our decision to enter.own opinion, from the point of view of economythe Government ought not to decline the offer ofthe Royal Aero Club to find the funds.The Secretary of State for Air made clearthat even though the Royal Aero Club might find the funds,  and would remain nominally responsiblefor the race,  it would in effect be unavoidableto provide pilots from the Royal Air Force and forthe Air Ministry to take charge of the arrangementsanother of more than -2^ m.p.h.TheoreticallyA added that in his3to much the same extent as in 1921?.
mmAfter some discussion,  the Cabinet agreed -(a)&quot; That, subject to no expense being incurred on public funds,  theGovernment should enable theRoyal Aero Club to conduct the race forthe Schneider Trophy,  includingBritish participation,  and that thearrangements should be subject to negotiation between the Secretaryof State for Air and the RoyalAero Club;(b) That the reply to questions inParliament should be to the aboveeffect;(c) That the Secretary of State for Air,accompanied by a representative ofthe Treasury, should at once seethe representatives of the RoyalAero Club and draw up an agreement which should secure inter aliathat no expense shall fall on public funds.-if-
TH3 TRADE UNION*KD TRADE[disputes bill.(previous; Reference;Cabinet 6(31), Con-clusion 11)After a shor&quot;t discussion, the cabinet agreed  a:(a) That a Committee, composed asfollows -The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs %The Home Secretary,The Secretary of State for War,The Attorney-General,should be appointed to take charge, onbehalf of the Cabinet, of the TradeUnion and Trade Disputes Bill, fromthe moment that the first batchof amendments to be proposed tothe Bill in Committee become available;(b) That the above Committee should beauthorised to keep in touch withthe Trades Union Congress  Counciland should report to the Cabinetwhenever they deem necessary;(c) That the Secretary of State for Y/ar,as well as the Attorney-General,should be one of the GovernmentMembers of the parliamentary committee on the Bill.

The Cabinet had before them the following documents on the subject of the Sugar Beet Subsidy:-A Memorandum by the Minister ofAgriciTlture and Fisheries (CP..-17(31)) laying before his colleagues,as a matter of extreme urgency, theserious position of the sugar beetindustry in this country, and recommending that, subject tocertain conditions, the imminentfall in the subsidy should be from13/- to 8s06d. instead of to 6sc6dper owt. of sugar.   The cost of thisextra assistance to the industry inthe financial year 19 31 would notexceed  600,000, and would probablybe considerably less:A Memorandum by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (C .P.-19 (31)), inreply to the above, setting forthvery strong grounds of objection,from the point of view of theTreasury, to the proposal of tieMinister of Agriculture and Fisheries *In the course of discussion the Cabinetheard statements from the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries and the Chancellor of the Exchequer.They felt that the position required further investigation, more particularly as to whatbeenreserves had/accumulated by the interests concerned and what their profits had been during the yearsof comparative prosperity.     The question wasalso felt to require careful consideration fromthe point of view of what the reactions would bre from the proposed temporary relaxation of theagreement with the sugar beet industry on otherdepressed industries at home and on the sugarproducers in the Colonies.The Cabinet agreed?-That the Chancellor of the Exchequer,the President of the Board of Trade,the Minister of A.gri culture andFisheries,should meet representatives of the farmers and the &quot;beet sugar factorieswith a view to ascertaining from them the position as regards their reserves-and profits in recent years and generally to discuss the situation.

In view, however,  of the previousattitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government on thisquestion and the popularity of the White paper which had been issued on&apos;the subject, he expressed doubts as to the advisability of appointing a Royal Commission.    The cabinet were reminded, however, of the strong views ofthe Governor of Malta which were shared inGovernment Departments here, that the primeMinister and Members of the Malta Governmentcould not be retained much longer in theanomalous position they now held.(The Cabinet felt that they couldnot reach a decision on the subject in the absence of the Prime Minister..On the Prime Minister&apos;s return towardsthe end of the meeting the discussion was resumed.    By that/fcime the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs had been compelled &quot;to withdraw to keep an appointment at the Foreign&apos; Off ic e).

lieINDIA.\fiB$*l -Policy[taxation ofgotton Goods .[(previous reference:Cabinet 15(5C), Con-conclusion 12.)7. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for India (C.P.-18 (31))circulating for the information of his colleaguestwo telegrams from the Government of India indicatingtheir Budget proposals  for 19 31-32,  and callingparticular attention to a proposal to impose atemporary surcharge of 5 per cent. Customs Duty on cotton piece-goods   a measure estimated to yieldabout  900,000.(The Prime Minister was absent during theconsideration of this question).The Secretary of State for India laidthe greatest stress on the Importance of adheringstrictly to the yarltf Autonomy Convention.    Heearnestly deprecated any representations being madeto the Government of India on the subject ofthe effect of the new duties on Lancashire.   Todo so immediately after the Indian Round table conference, at which full tariff autonomy hadbeen promised, would Tse misunderstood and mis-represented in India and could do nothing butharm.      He recalled that the representations madeon a previous occasion by the Cabinet had been followed by a very serious accentuation of the boycott in India,    The inevitable prolongation of the boycott would, in his opinion, far outweighany advantage that could be obtained from areduction in the duty.On the other hand, the Cabinet vusrereminded of the strong feelings existing inLancashire on this subject which made it verydifficult for the Government not to make some
representations,,       It was pointecLotrt thatthe Government of India had stated in the last paragraph of the second Telegram attached to cp.-18(31) that they would he grateful forobservations by Telegram.      It was suggested thatthe reply could be so worded as to make it quite clear that there was no question of interfering with India&apos;s fiscal autonomy but that,in replying to a request for observations,the Government feltbaund to apprise the Government of Iiadia of theeffect their proposals would&apos; have on Lancashirewhich is already suffering from dire distress.The Secretary of State for India addedthat, in any event, any such Telegram would haveto emanate from the Cabinet and not from the IndiaOffice, and he warned his colleagues that in his view it would only do harm in India, withoutbenefiting the trade of the United Kingdom in anyway.The Cabinet agreed; -That the President of the Board of trade should draft, for their consideration atan early meeting, a Telegram setting forth the effects of the Government ofIndia&apos;s proposals on British trade,onthe lines suggested above.
1id(The Prime Minister returned, during thediscussion of this question).CINEMAS.Sunday-performances .ft3.    The attention of the Cabinet was  called,  asa matter of urgency,  to a judgment delivered inthe Court of Appeal on the previous day, which made it quite clear that the opening of cinemasand places of entertainment on Sundays was illegaland that no person or authority has power &quot;co grantexemption from the provisions of the Act.      Thisdecision affects the practice of the lord chamberlain who would now have no alternative butto withdraw any permission which he had given forthe Sunday opening of theatres and to refuse any future application which he may receive.      It wassuggested that when announcing the decision of theGovernment on the subject,  the Home Secretary should state that the Government were considering thewhole situation.The Cabinet agreed - (a) That the Home Secretary shouldbe authorised to state that adecision had been given as towhat was the lav/&quot;,  and that thelaw would have to be carriedout;(b) That if pressed to state thefuture policy of the Governmenton the subject,  the PrimeMinister should intimate that legislation would requireagreement, and that he was inconsultation with the .ueadersof the Opposition partieswith this object.&quot;
