THE CHANCELLOR 1. The Prime Minister informed his colleagues of THEEXCHEQUER. that he had just received a report by telephonefrom the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s medicaladviser that Mr Snowden was going on as well as could, he expected.
CINWAS..e Publicntertainmentisunday Per-formances)ill.previous reference:Cabinet 16(31), Con-elusion 3.).2. The Cabinet had before them the following-documents relating to the Public Entertainment^Sunday Performances) Bill:-A Memorandum by the Home Secretary(H.A.-10 (31)) covering the original draft Bill:A further Memorandum by the HomeSecretary covering a revised draftof the Bill (H.cA,-ll (31)):The Draft Conclusions of the Committeeof Home Affairs (H.A.C . 6th Conclu--sions  (31), Paragraph 1).In these latter Conclusions it was recorded thatthe Home Secretary had informed the Committee thatthe Bill had been drafted at very short notice andthat it was now found that there were a number of matters which required further consideration.    Forexample, it was the intention that a political or similar meeting which comprised a concert and inrespect of which a charge for admission was made,should be protected by the Bill:    the time (6 p.ma)before which entertainments must not commencerequired reconsideration if ordinary Sunday afternoonconcerts were to continue:    provision might also have to be made enabling, in special cases, profitsto be devoted to such purposes as the payment off of debt instead of to some charitable object.The recommendation of the Committee of Home affairs to the Cabinet was as follows:-To authorise the introduction in theHouse of Commons of the PublicEnt ertainment (Sunday Performanc es)Bill in the form of the draft annexed to H.A.-10 (31),  subject to any amendments which the Home Secretary,after consultation with the Departmentsconcerned, may decide to introduce inregard to the matters still under hisconsideration and subject also to any drafting or other minor alterations that may be found necessary ord es irable .
The Solicitor-General gave the Cabinet particulars of the latest draft of the Bill.   Among the moreimportant points in which the new draft differed fromits predecessor were the provisions for localoption in the opening of specified places of enter-.tainment.   As the existing licensing authorities were in some eases unsuitable for carrying outenquiries, and so forth, with a view to ascertaining the opinion of the locality, the Bill provided thatthe licensing power should be vested in the CountyCouncil or Borough Council.    The Bill now providednot only for musical entertainments and cinematographsbut also for the exhibition of animals or inanimateobjects  (in order to include the Zoological Gardens)and debate (to cover political meetings).   The clauseproviding for the allocation of profits to charitableobjects now applied only to cinemas.   The cabinet were informed that theatres were not included, andit was recognised that this might be a subject of controversy in Parliament.The Prime Minister pointed out that the passageof the Bill was likely to take a long time, particular-larly in the Committee Stage.   Unless some special arrangements could be made this would block government measures.   He outlined a scheme for avoiding some ofthe difficulties, which is set forth in the Conclusionsbelow .After discussion of the political aspects, whichwere recognised to bear a resemblance to certain features of the position of Parties at the time ofthe consideration of the Prayer Book Measure, theCabinet agreed that  
(a) Arrangements should be madefor the Bill to be introduced byand backed by Private Members,preferably representing all Parties,under the Ten Minutes Rule, whichwould provide an opportunity for a parliamentary Division.   The Govern-ment could then announce that, as thematter was one of considerable publicinterest and importance, they wereprepared to test the opinion of theHouse of Commons and would providetime for a Second Reading Debatewith a free vote.    One advantageof this course was that the Bill,if it passed Second Reading, \vouldbe sent to the Private Members&apos;Committee, and not block government bills in the Standing Committees.By adopting this course members ofthe Cabinet would avoid having, toback the Hill,  and the responsibility-ity of the Government would belimited to finding time:(b) The Home Secretary should beauthorised to state that the members who introduced the Pill had been advised by the Home Office as toits form:(c) The Solicit or-General should be present during the discussions onthe Bill in Committee, for purposesof elucidation:(d) The Home Secretary should have authority to inform Mr Baldwinand Mr Lloyd George as to thecourse the Cabinet now proposedto adopt:(e) ^he Home Secretary should be invitedto consider the position of cinemasat Aerodrones and similar establish-ments of the Fighting Services andshould,  if possible,  insert safeguardsto avoid their having to obtain a licence:(f) No time could be found before Fasterfor Second Reading of the Bill, butthis would, not preclude its introduc-tion under the Ten Minutes Rule.
^tto^ION AND 3. &quot;&quot;&quot;he Prime Minister informed the Cabinet thatt TUXrn A&quot; ION OParjMMBNTS . it had now been arranged that the three-Party Sub-preparations for   Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence onthe&quot; Dis armamentConference. the Disarmament Conference should be composed asfollows:-(previous reference: The Prime Minister (In the Chair),Cabinet 17 The Chancellor of the Exchequer,(51),.

The Prime Minister made a statement to theCabinet as to forthcoming Parliamentary business,which included the. following points:-(i) The Chancellor of the Exchequer hoped to be able to make his own Budget Speechtowards the end of April.(ii) The Conservative Chief Whip had suggestedthat the Parties should come to an arrange-ment as to Parliamentary Business with aview to obtaining a few additional daysvacation at Easter, which was badly neededowing to the strain which had been placedon the House, of Commons-.   The parliamentary secretary to the Treasury was working out a plan for discussion with the ChiefWhips of the other Parties.(iii) The programme of business before Easteronly allowed for Second Reading debate on one of the Government&apos;s major measures.The Cabinet then discussed the claims of&quot;the consumers&apos;  Council Bill, the Town and Country planning bill, and the London Passenger Transport Bill.   Theywere informed that it was now too late for theConsumers1 Council Bill to be passed unless the&quot;guillotine&quot; could be applied in Committee.    Theywere also reminded that prices had fallen considerably.mhe Prime Minister said he was willing to considera &quot;Kangaroo&quot; procedure in Committee, but not the&quot;Guillotine&quot;.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the London Passenger Transport. Bill should receive Second reading on Monday, March 23rd.(b) That the Town and Country planning bill should be printed and, introduced before Easter, but not put down for second Reading.

6. The President of the Board of Trade made astatement to the Cabinet on the subject of thedifficulties which were reported in the Press tohave arisen in connection with the coal &quot;quota&quot;.These difficulties were confined mainly to Yorkshireand the Midlands.    He gave particulars as to how the       trouble      had arisen, and stated that it was anticipated by the Mines Department that the dislocation-tion was temporary and due partly to the action ofsome of the interests concerned and partly to the inevitable difficulties of a transitional period.He undertook to look into a case reported in thePress and brought to the notice of the Cabinet bythe Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs. ThePresident added that he had taken steps to bringtogether the parties concerned with a view to securing agreement to provide for the position in July nextThen the hours of working in the mines would automati-cally fall by a further half-hour.The Prime Minister invited thePresident of the Board of Tradeto consider means for securinggreater publicity of the factson such matters as the coal quota.He suggested that he might inviterepresentatives of the Press, forexample, the Lobby Correspondentsin the House of Commons,  to meet him..

The question of the Home Wheat Quota Schemewas raised in accordance with the Conclusion reached at the Meeting referred to in the margin that thesubject should he placed on the Agenda from week toTj*eek as it was desirable that a decision should bereached before Easter.    The Cabinet again had beforethem, therefore,  the Interim Report of the Agricul-tttral Development Committee (CP.-52 (31)),.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries drew attention to the inconvenience arising, from thisquestion remaining unsettled.The Prime Minister reminded the Cabinet thatthe subject was to be taken up as soon as theChancellor of the Exchequer was well enough toattend a Meeting, which might,  if necessary, beheld in his own house.    In the meantime the subject should be continued on the Agenda Paper.

ippE ARMY AND C  The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by air FORCE(ANNUAL) BILL.     the Secretary of State for War (CP .-70 (31))covering the draft Army and Air Force (Annual) Bill,(previous reference: In his covering Memorandum the Secretary of StateCabinet 53(30), Con- for War drew attention to the clause relating toelusion 1.)the death penalty.   The last Annual Bill included a clause abolishing the death penalty for cowardice(and certain other offences)  on active service, andfor desertion or persuading to desert on active service.   These changes were in the first instancethrown out after debate by the Lords, but reinstatedby the Commons and returned to the Lords.    As theresult of the second, debate they were accepted bythe House of Lords, but Lord Salisbury expressedthe hope that the Army Act should, on a futureoccasion,  in a measure at any rate, be restored toits original form.   The Secretaries of State forWar and Air, however, were agreed that there couldbe no question of re-introducing the death penaltyin eases in which it had been abolished.    Further,they did not think that any proposal should be entertained which seeks to remove the death penaltyin the case of those offences (broadly speaking,fortreachery, mutiny and sedition)/which it at presentremains.The Secretary of State for War in his Memorandumalso drew attention to an amendment made to meetobjection urged by the Irish Free State representa-tives at the Imperial Conference, that the previousAct applied specifically to Ireland and that it wasimproper for the Parliament at Westminster to pass legislation applying its terms to the Irish FreeState..   This objection had been met, with theconcurrence of the Secretary of State for Air,-12-
fby arranging that in the future the Irish&apos; Free state should be grouped with the other Dominions under the term &quot;elsewhere&quot;, the Army and Air Force Acts runningthere from July to July instead of April to April.In order to avoid a gap between April, 19 31, when,under the current Act, the Army and Air Force Actsexpire in the Irish Free State, and July 1931, aspecial provision was necessary in this year&apos;s Actby which the currency of the Army and Air Force Actswould be for 15 months in the Irish Free State(viz., from April, 19 31, to July, 19 32)  instead offor the customary 12 months ,As the Bill had to receive the Royal Assent bythe end of April, the Secretary of State for Warasked for the concurrence of the Cabinet in thecircu!la tion of the Bill at the earliest opportunity.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That, so far as the death penalty isconcerned, the Secretary of state should have authority to stand firmlyby the compromise reached last year:(b) To approve the amendment introduced to meet the objections of the IrishFree State Government:(c) That the Secretary of State for war should have authority to introduce the Bill, which was down for SecondReading on Thursday, March 26th.
