1. At the suggestion of the President of theBoard of Trade, the Secretary for Mines was invitedto attend this Meeting of the Cabinet.The President of the Board of Trade reported the results of his interview with the representa-tives of the mine-owners .    The situation, he reported, was possibly a little more hopeful, but still extremely difficult.    The owners had statedthat they could not recognise the National Indus-trial Board.   The President had then reminded themthat the Board had been set up by Act of Parliament,and had impressed upon them the serious nature oftheir attitude, but they still insisted on adhering to it.   The President had then recalled the drasticcut in wages proposed by the mine-owners last-November.   They replied that those proposals hadbeen withdrawn, and called attention to their proposals of January 3rd (See Appendix to theMinutes referred to in the margin),    The following two points had emerged from a long discussion:-(i) The owners were agreeable to the holding of a meeting of the lateSouth Wales Conciliation Board totake place at Cardiff on the follow-ing afternoon, provided it was understood that the whole situation was open for discussion there, -hours, wages,  etc. ?or this discussion theywould drop their offer of January 3rd.(ii) The owners were ready to submit their case, if recommended by theConciliation Board, to an inquiry to be established under theIndustrial Courts Act, 1919.The President of the Board of Trade understoodthat by the use of this machinery the mine-ownershoped to obtain a settlement for a longer term than was contemplated by their offer of January 3rd, towhich they attached the utmost importance.   Theyhad said that they would prefer that the stoppage
should continue rather than that they should not get a longer term of settlement.   The Presidentof the Board of Trade had arranged to see therepresentatives of the miners at 6-30 p.m. at theBoard of Trade, and the question arose as to what attitude he was to take.   The miners had said thatthey must have the decision of the National Indus-trial Board or nothing.    It was doubtful, therefore,if they would agree to meet the owners at the lateStouth Wales Conciliation Board or go to an Inquiryset up under the Industrial Courts Act, 1919.In the course of the discussion it was explainedthat the Inquiry contemplated was not the industrial court itself, of which Sir Harold Spencer Morrisis Chairman, but a special Court to be set up under the Industrial Courts Act, with an independent chairman and equal numbers of representatives ofemployers and employed.    Such a Court wou^dordinarily only make a recommendation, but itwould be possible for the two parties to agreethat the recommendation should be binding.The main question considered by the cabinet was as to whether the President of the Board ofTrade should advise the miners to accept the two proposals summarised above.    It was realised that,owing to the attitude of the mine-owners, therewas a hopeless deadlock as regards the national industrial Board,   The Coal Mines Act setting upthe National Industrial Board had not,  it waspointed out, debarred the use of other machineryfor dealing with disputes.   The position, however,would be difficult if the miners rejected a recom-mendation from a representative of the Governmentto adopt machinery other than that provided for
in the Act passed on the initiative of the present government tAfter considerable discussion the cabinet agreed  That the President of the Eoard ofTrade should inform the representa-tives of the South Wales minersfully as to what had transpired atthe meeting with the owners, andshould intimate that the latter wereprepared for a discussion of all aspects of the situation at theformer South Wales ConciliationBoard in Cardiff on the following afternoon.    He should also explain that a proposal might emerge forreferring the question to theIndustrial Court, but should leavethe decision to the unfettereddiscretion of the miners themselveswithout making any recommendation.He should also intimate that ifthe Government were pressed by both sides, as the result of themeeting of the Conciliation Board,to set up an Inq-uiry under theIndustrial Courts Act, they wouldnot refuse.
m GOAL 2.    The attention of the Cabinet was called togUATION.  an allegation made by Mr A.J.Cook, the SecretaryLe Govern-joint&apos;s of the Miners&apos;  Federation, and published in the[jitudeiwards Press on the same day, to the effect that oniges .November 20th last the Government had given a promise to the Miners&apos; Delegate Conference that inthe event of any attempt to reduce wages when the shorter day came,  &quot;The miners will have the fullmoral support of the Government in resisting it^.,and that if the owners did reduce wages such action would &quot;not only be against the miners but againstthe Government&quot;.The President of the Board of Trade said thathe had made enquiries as to what was the basis ofMr Cook&apos;S statement.    As the result he had obtainedfrom the representatives of the miners the following statement alleged to have been handed to theMiners&apos;  Federation on the 14th November, 1929,as the agreed policy of the Government in regardto wages, to be made in the House of Commons bythe Prime Minister:-&quot;In regard to wages and the position which may arise in South Wales and other districts by the termination of the agree-ment at the end of the year.    -Se have reason to think that in all probabilitythe owners will not take any action thisyear, but will arrange to carry on as atpresent until the reduced working daycomes into operation next year.    It ispossible, however, that early next year the owners will claim that as thelegislation on hours has in effectterminated the existing agreement,itis necessary that they should be revisedas and from April next, and there is bound to be a possibility of the ownersapplying for a reduction in any or all of the districts affected.    It has been already stated by the Government thatx one object in framing the present proposals has been to secure the maximumreduction in hours which,in the opinionof the Government, the industry can bearwithout the necessity for a reduction in 4r-
wages .   When the proposals are before. the. House the Government will againmake it perfectly clear that,  in theviev&apos;: of the Government, no justificationwill exist for any attempt to reducewages in any district.   In the eventof any such attempt being made, theminers will have the full moral supportOf the Government in res is tin:-; it.    If,therefore, the owners reduce wages suchan action would not only be against theminers, but it would be also againstthe Government, and being calculated to defeat one of the main purposes of thepresent measures it would force, theGovernment to consider the position again.&quot;The above statement was said to have been handed to the representatives of the Miners&apos; Federationafter a meeting held at the Board of Trade in thePresident&apos;s room.    This meeting followed a meeting with the Prime Minister on the preceding day, when a statement to the above effect was said to havebeen promised.    The President of the Board of trade informed the Cabinet that he was enquiring furtheras to the exact facts in regard to this - document.Whitehall Gardens, SJanuary 6,  19 31.
