ft REDUCTION and limitation of armaments.The Franco-ItalianPosit ion,(previous reference:Cabinet 22(31), Con-elusion 4.)F.R.2. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that up to the present time he had not receivedthe French proposal for a settlement of the outstand-ing difficulty in the Franco-Italian negotiations.He hoped to receive it later in the day, and afterconferring with the Prime Minister and the FirstLord of the Admiralty he thought, it possible that he might be in a -position to put something before theCabinet at the outset o^ their Meeting on Friday.
4y d-organisationtrON AND STEED ^. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe President o^ the Board of Trade (CP.-90 (31))covering a brief summary of a meeting with therepresentatives of the Iron and Steel industry whopreviousReference: co-operated with Mr Bruce Gardner in the preparationCabinet 2 3 made(31), Con^ :.   -     of his Report.    In this summary it was/clear thatelusion $.)-.2^ M 7the lines of re-organisation suggested in the report are acceptable to representatives of the great bulkof the iron and steel industry.    Considerablefinance, however, would be needed, to put the various schemes into operation,  and the President of theBoard of ^rede was informed that the leaders of theindustry see no likelihood of obtaining the money from the investing public.    If money were advanced by the Government or the City it could only be onthe term that no payment of interest or repayment of capital could be made unless and until profitswere earned.The President of the Board of Trade made a full report to the Cabinet not only on the meeting withthe representatives of the Directors of the principaliron rnd steel concerns in the country, but also with supporters of the Government in Parliamentrepresenting constituencies that would be affected,and with representatives of the Trades unions concerned.    So far as the employers were concerned the two main points were that they were in agreementwith Mr Bruce GardnerTe plan but that they would not-undertake it unless assured of the home market.He gave particulars of the bad state of the industryand of the extent to which^imports have recentlyexceeded exports.    He explained that it was impossibleto deal with dumping without first denouncing existingTreaties that were to our advantage.    The President
of the Eoard of Trade advocated doing what waspossible to stimulate both private firms and public authorities to exercise a voluntary preference inthe use o^ British iron and steel^ on lines already in operation in the shipping industry.    Care wasnecessary, however, to avoid any form of compulsionwhich could be represented as an evasion of Treatycommitments.   While favouring in principle some plan for giving legislative effect to the Bruce GardnerReport,  the President thought that in the cireum-stances of the case the MsTplan would be to create/a large public utility company, which would operate in three or four main groups.   The finance of such a plan would require working out in detail, and forthis purpose he proposed to invite the co-operationof one or two business men and an accountant.He asked the Cabinet to give him authority to describe the position of the Iron and Steel industry, and the urgency of some early re-organisation, to the Liberalleaders and to explain to them his plan of a publicutility company.In the course of the discussion it was pointedout that this was the first proposal for the constitu-tion of a public utility corporation for an industryin competition with corresponding industries abroad,-and that the finance would differ widely from suchundertakings as the Port of London Authority or theone to be set up by the London Passenger transport bill.    A difficult question would arise as to the raising of the money:    i.e.r whether it should.befound by the Government or raised under government guarantee, for there appeared to be no prospect of raising it by an unguaranteed appeal to the public.
Further dif^flcudrtfLes- vere^ixrijTted-^c^-&apos;labour.    The Cabinet were informed that already some90,000 persons out of 2CC,000 workers in the industry were unemployed.   That number might be increased by a process  of rationalisation.    It would be impossibleto saddle the rationalised industry at the outsetwith this burden, and public opinion would hold theGovernment responsible for this large figure ofunemployed .The Cabinet were told that if the figures werestudied it would be found that in 1929 our iron andsteel industry had shown improvement.    In 1930 ithad deteriorated, but the corresponding industry inGermany and the United States of America had sufferedeven more severely, and in Belgium as severely.    Itwas suggested, therefore, that the difficulties  ofthe industry were due more to the world depressionthan to any local cause.The Cabinet were generally in favour of thePresident of the Board of Traders plan for doing everything possible to stimulate the use of Britishbothiron and steel/by individual firms and by public authorities, and agreed  fa) That the President of the Board ofTrade should examine fully into thefinance of his proposal for thecreation of a public utility company with a view to the rationalisation ofthe Iron and Steel industry,  and makea further report to the Cabinet:fb) That the President of the Board of .Trade should be authorised to takethe Liberal Industrial Committee intothe confidence of the Government as tothe.present parlous condition of theIron and Steel trade:    giving them allthe facts;    pointing out the difficulties-ti.es which were encountered in everyproposal, and explaining, to them thathis aim was to consult and exchangeviews as to what should be done, butthat he was not in a position to
commit the Government as to the remedy which was to be adopted:(c) That the President of the Boardof Trade should also discuss thequestion with Sir Alexander Walker.
FXPORT 4.   The Cabinet agreed  CREDITS .(a) To approve a proposal of the Presidentof the Eoard 0* Trade that the Export(Previous Credits (Cabinet) Committee should be reference: authorised to hold a meeting with threeCabinet 21 representatives each of the Federation(31), Con- of British Industries,  the Trades Unionelusion 9.) Congress General Council, and the russian trade Delegation, in order to ascertaindefinitely what proposal the latterf. R. had to offer for placing Russian orders in the United Kingdom:(b) That a representative of the ForeignOffice and a representative of theTreasury should in addition be present at the above meeting.
THE COAL 5.    The President of the Board of Trade statedSITUATION.that the Cabinet Committee would present a Report(Previous in the near future, and that they would probablyReference:Cabinet 23 have to ask for a Special Meeting of the Cabinet to(31).  Con-clusion 4.)      discuss the whole of the coal situation,  includingF.&quot;R. the position that would arise in July,16 6&apos;)&apos;*-

Tb.e Cabinet, &quot;ha-d b-efor-e tttera;lJae-&quot;Ttje^n^t-^f&quot; :a -Cabinet Committee (CP.-37 (31)) on the Export of,,7ar Materials and Warships, the Conclusions ofwhich are summarised in the Report as follows:-(l) The Committee are unable to recommend the Cabinet to promote legislation forthe repeal of the provision in section of the Trade Facilities Act, 1921,^prohibiting the application of theExport Credits Guarantee Scheme to export transactions in respect ofthe sale of munitions of war.(2) The Committee, however, do not considerthat this prohibition extends to aircraft or other articles or parts thereof, which are unarmed, which contain no armament fittings, andwhich are capable of being usedfor civil purposes.(3) The Committee are awaiting a further report from the First Lord o^ theAdmiralty and the President of theBoard of Trade on enquiries instituted by them in the case of Messrs BaringBrothers and other financial houses,regarding the possibility of financialassistance being given by thoseinstitutions to the armament firms in respect of foreign orders forwarships and other munitions of war.The First Lord of the Admiralty reported that,,thanks partly to the assistance of the-ForeignOffice, the British armament industry had&apos; securedorders from Portugal to the amount of  l,90e-,OOQ:out of a total expenditure of  3,390,005:, thebalance of the order having been placed in Italy.The orders included four Destroyers, two of whichwould be assembled in Portugal, and two smallsloops, as well as the armament, equipment&apos; and fire control for the whole of the ships,.. including those to be built in Italy,The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that he was satisfied with this position.
The Cabinet agreed  To (approve the Report of the CabinetCommittee and to await the further report from the First Lord of theAdmiralty and the President of thePoard of Trade referred to inConclusion (S) above.
7, The Secretary of State for th,e Colonies &quot;saidthat he had conferred with Dr. Weizmann, who had agreed to do what he could to try and stop theevictions in Palestine referred to at the meeting mentioned in the margin.   The High Commissionerreported, however, that he did not expect that colonel Kisch would he able to prevent them.    TheSecretary of State read to the Cabinet telegramNo. 104 from the High Commissioner of Palestine,sent in reply to his own suggestion that the Billagreed to in London with the representatives of the zionists, which would enable him to prevent evic-tions, should be introduced.   The High Commissioner^telegram, however, was somewliat ambiguous, as in one part he expressed apprehension as to the political consequences of the evictions^ and in anothersuggested the deferment of publication until theHigh Commissioners return to England in May.-The Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary of State for theColonies should draw attention tothe ambiguity of the High Commis-sioner&apos;s telegram and wishes, but should be authorised to deferpublication of the Bill until theHigh Commissioner^ return.
PALESTINE.The WailingWall.(previous cms reference:Cabinet 48(29)    C on-conclusion 9 .)8.   The Secretary of State for the colonies said he had telegraphed to the High Commissioner inPalestine to suggest that the publication of theReport on the Wailing wall was desirable before thePermanent Mandates Committee met in June.   He hadnot yet received a, reply.The Cabinet agreed  That, before taking his finaldecision, the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies should, await thereturn, of the High Commissioner,who is leaving for England in abouta w e ek ,

THE USE OP 10. The Cabinet had&quot; before them-a Memorandum byBRITISHHONDURAS AS the Secretary of State for the Colonies &apos;C.P.-92 (31))A BASF FORTHE ILIICIT     covering copies of a Secret Despatch sent to the liquor TRADE.Governor of British Honduras on the subject of the(Previous        -use of British Honduras as a base for the illicitReference:Cabinet 66     liquor trade    together with his reply,.   The gist of(30), Con-elusion 15.) the reply is contained in the last paragraph, whichF-fi, is as follows:-5(35)1.&quot;It is my considered opinion that Ishould receive no support from themajority of the Council in any measure aimed at regulating theexport of liquor, but rather that every possible step would be takenin opposition to such a course.    regret that short of a change inthe Constitution I am unable tosuggest any method of bringing pressure to bear on the council with a view to securing, the adoptionof measures to restrain the trade..I consider that to change theConstitution for this purpose would lead to a political crisis andintense local feeling against theGovernment which would render it extremely difficult to maintainefficient administration, and Iam unable to advise the adoptionof such a step&quot; .In his covering Memorandum the Secretary of Stateexpressed the view that at the present time it wouldbe very difficult to press the Governor further inthe matter,  although he was not in agreement withthe tenor of certain paragraphs of the Governor&apos;despatch.   He was not prepared to threaten Imperiallegislation unless the Cabinet had made up their minds to have recourse to it,  if necessary.The Cabinet took note of theSecretary of State&apos;s Memorandum.

14. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Transport  (C.P.-99 (31)) in connectionwith the London Passenger Transport Bill, reporting that as a result of prolonged, discussions he had beenable to reach a basis of agreement which Lord Ashfieldwas prepared to recommend to his Board and to thestockholders, and which the Minister       transport was equally ready to recommend to his colleagues and to Parliament,  in regard to the terms for theacquisition of the Underground. Croup of Companies .Pull details of the proposed terms were given in aseparate Note attached to the Memorandum.    The Ministerof Transport asked for assent to conclude the agree-ment with lord. Ash:fmeld&apos;s Companies, subject to confirmation by Parliament,  and to make the necessarydetailed amendments to the Pill, subject to the con-currence o^ the Treasury on points in which they were concerned .As the above Memorandum had only been circulatedlate on the previous evening the Minister of Transportmade a full statement to the Cabinet on the subject,dwelling&apos;more particularly on the financial aspectsof the proposed agreement.    He explained that theTreasury had been kept informed of the financial aspects of the negotiations and offered no opposition,though he himself took responsibility for the agree-ment,    In making this agreement he and Lord Ashfieldhad been handicapped by the fact that they had no knowledge of the Chancellor of the Exehequerjsintentions as to the taxation of petrol.   He had felt,however&apos;, that the taxation of a particular year,in so much as it was liable to alteration in subse-quent years, was not a basis on which a permanentagreement ought to be fixed.   There were possibilities
IIalso in the direction of the use of Diesel engineswith heavy oil, which might affect the question.The Minister of Transport was invited to give special consideration to the objections of certainTrades Unions against the elimination of the &quot;national wages Board under the Railways Act of 1921  from thescope of the new plan.On learning from the Minister of Transport thata decision was a matter of greao urgency if theagreement were to be implemented, the Cabinet agreed --To adopt the Report of theMinister of Transport and toask him to complete theagreement.
