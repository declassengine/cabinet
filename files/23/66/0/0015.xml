NATIONALITY 8.  The Cabinet had before them the followingIp&quot; MARRIEDdocuments relating to Nationality of Married Women:A Memorandum by the Home Secretaryprevious (CP--45 (31)) prepared afterReference: studying the events that had cabinet 11 occurred at the recent meeting(31), Oon- of the Council of the League of elusion 11.) Nations at Geneva on the subject.The Home Secretary asked that the ft Cabinet should now take into con-\ sideration the proposals he had*)(yi.)tO made in an earlier Memorandum(CP.-13 (31)) to the effect thatthe Government should give nofurther facilities for the Nation-ality of Married Women Bill, intro-duced by the late Dr. Bentham, but should announce its intention of introducing at some future date aBill to carry out the policy setforth in his Memorandum and repro-reproduced in the Conclusions of theCabinet mentioned in the margin:A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs (C.P.-53(31)),  in reply to the above, statingthat the question now seemed to havebeen opened up In a way that was not contemplated when the late Dr.Bentham&apos;bill was last before the House, andthat to proceed in the manner suggestedby the Home Secretary would probablyarouse criticism from the Women&apos;organisations both in this and othercountries.The Conclusions of theImperial Conference would undoubtedlyprevent our going, as far as the pro-visions contained in the late Dr.Bentham&apos;bill, and the question would aertainlybe the subject of debate in the nextAssembly of the League,    In thesecircumstances two courses appearedto be open:-(i) Having regard to other claimsupon Parliamentary time, to try to dispose of Dr. Bentham&apos;s Billon the ground that a new situation has been created by the decision toplace the matter on the Agenda ofthe next Assembly:      or(ii) For the Home Secretary to ascertain the views of the women&apos;s organisa-tions in this country before proceeding further with the Bill.
The Home Secretary, while not opposing the first of the proposals of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, was averse from any initiativebeing taken by the Government on the secondproposal.    It was suggested to him that if theWomen&apos;s Organisations pressed for him to receive them his attitude towards them should be inaccordance with the decision set forth below.The Cabinet agreed  That when the late Dr. Benthara&apos;bill reached the StandingCommittee, the Home secretary should, announce the new situation that had arisen and try anddispose of the Bill on these grounds.
9. The Cabinet had before them the following documents relating to title to Widows&apos; pension under the Contributory Pensions Act, 1929:-A Memorandum by the Minister ofHealth (CP.-39  (31))  on thePosition of Widows whose husbandshad been incapable of work for morethan three years before death,which had been affected by a HighCourt decision in the case ofJennings &amp; Qrs . v. The Minister ofHealth.   The result of the Judgmentwas to leave it open to the Refereesfas a matter of law, either to admitor reject certain claims for whichpension would have been awarded ifthe view of the Ministry of Healthhad prevailed.   As the position, asthe result of this Judgment,differed from what the Ministerof Health stated to be the original intention of the Act, the Memorandumcontained a suggestion that a one-clause Bill should be introduced to rectify the matter:A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Scotland (CP.-47 (31))expressing agreement with the abovepr opos al.In explaining the case in detail, the Minister ofHealth laid stress on the fact that 2,600 claimshad been held over for decision by the Department,nearly all of which would have to be rejected.There were also some thousands of cases in whichawards had been made in accordance with the line taken by the Ministry of Health, and which had now become illegal.    If nothing were done there appearedno alternative to recovering the payments that hadbeen made.The Cabinet agreed  That the Minister of Health should.;s ound the Leaders of the Opposition/-Parties with a view to facilitating the passage of a Bill, as proposedin his Memorandum,  and should reportthe result to the Cabinet at their next Meeting.WTDfiWS&apos;PEB&amp;IQNS.Title toPens-ion underthe Contribu-tory pensions act, 1929.(previous reference:Cabinet 71(30),  Con-clusion 4.)
CINEMAS .Sunday Per-formances.Sabbath DayObservance.(previous reference:Cabinet 13(31), Oon-clusion 12.)10. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Home Secretary (CP.-48 (31))  on the difficult situation which had arisen out of the recent judgment of the Courts on the question of the Sunday openingof cinemas and other places of entertainment.   Theeffect of this Judgment was, briefly, that the sunday Observance Act, 1780, was still fully inforce and that no person or authority had any powerto grant exemption from, or to give any consent to,the breach of its provisions.   As the result it was now illegal to open for public entertainment oramusement on Sundays any house, room or other place to which persons are admitted by payment of money or by tickets sold for money.    In the view of theHome Secretary some solution of the difficulty mustbe found without delay.   His proposal was for theGovernment to introduce legislation based on thefollowing principles:-(i) The question whether Sunday enter-tainments should be allowed to beleft to the decision of the localLicensing Authority:(ii) The Licensing Authority should berequired to satisfy itself thatthere is a general demand in thearea for the opening of the premiseson Sunday and that such openingwould be in the public interest:(iii) The element of private gain should,as far as possible, be eliminated,receipts in excess of specifiedexpenditure being given to local or national charities approved bythe Licensing Authorities:(iv) Safeguards against the employmentof persons for more than six days a week in a place of entertainment:(v) The Licensing Authorities to beentitled to impose other conditionshearing on the hours of opening andthe character of the entertainment.The Home Secretary further suggested that beforeintroducing such legislation the Leaders of theOpposition Parties should be consulted.
In the course of the discussion the Cabinet were informed that the theatrical profession, whileperhaps not anxious to ,open the theatres on Sundays,nevertheless objected strongly to the privileged position occupied by the cinemas, which,  since theintroduction of the &quot;talkie&quot; films, practicallyproduced stage plays .    The Cabinet were also reminded that halls and theatres were frequently engaged for political meetings.    Sometimes a charge was madefor admission.    Sometimes, also,  these meetingsincluded musical performances and. other entertain-ment, although in some places the Local authorities would, not allow this .The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Law Officers  of the Crownshould be asked,  in consultationwith the Home Office, to advise the Cabinet as to what  in fact wasthe present position of the lawresulting from the recent Judgment,and that the Home Secretary should,inter, alia,  invite their particular attention to the various  forms ofpolitical meetings now held, on sundays in different parts of thecountry, writh a view to obtainingan Opinior as to whether they arerendere d unlawful:(b) That the Home Secretary should, enterinto consultation with the leadersof the Opposition Parties in theHouse of Commons and should inform them that the general intention ofthe Government was to restore thestatus quo before the recent Judgment;he should discuss the whole matter,including, the conditions proposedin his. Memorandum., and should, intimate,that the Cabinet are ratherconcerned- about the positionof theatres on Sundays,  andshould ascertain their view:(c) That the Home Secretary should report the result of his enquiriesat the next Meeting of the Cabinet.-IS-
EDUCATION.The VoluntarySchoolsProblem.(previous reference:Cabinet 9(31),  Con-clusion 4.)11&apos;The Cabinet took note of a Memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Education (CP.-50 (31))stating that the Cabinet Committee appointed tonegotiate a settlement of the Voluntary Schoolquestion had met a Deputation from the executive of the National Council of the Free Churches, when a series of resolutions had been discussed.    Itappeared eventually that nothing would content theFree Churchmen except the Church conceding theappointment of the Head Teacher in Voluntary Schoolsaided under agreements .   The Committee had metafterwards and had decided to ask that on Tuesdaynext Lord Ponsonby should urge the House of lords to give the Education Bill a Second Reading, inorder to allow time for negotiation to be continuedbetween the Education Authorities and the Churches .The Cabinet were informed that there was every reason to believe that the Education (school attendance) Bill would be thrown out by the Houseof Lords at    the Second Reading the same afternoon.Discussion then took place as to what thefurther action of the Government should be.The Cabinet agreed  That if the Bill were rejected bythe House of Lords the Governmentshould announce in the House ofCommons their intention to pass it under the Parliament Act and thatas the clause into which Mr Scurr&apos;amendment had been incorporatedwould remain as part of the Act asfinally passed, they proposed tocontinue the negotiations with aview to a settlement of the voluntary School question.
