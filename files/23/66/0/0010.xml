He thought the Cabinet ought not to dealwith the question in the absence of the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs without knowing theview of the Foreign Office. ., ....In the course of the discussion it was suggestedthat, as delicate political considerations were involved, it might be advisable to entrust the investigation to some independent person ratherthan to a Royal Commission.    It was also suggestedthat the announcement of a Royal Commission mighttend to weaken the position vis-a-vis the Vatican.The Cabinet- agreed - (a) That the question should be adjourned for a week, when it was hoped that
the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs would be present:That in the meanwhile theSecretary of State for theColonies should keep intouch with the Foreign Offi

The Cabinet agreed  (a) To leave to the Panel of ministers on Unemployment considernation ^fC.P.-1 (31) :Co) To take note that the Presidentof the Board of ^r^de hoped inthe near future to circulateinformation as to the proposedre-organisation of the Iron andSteel industry.-8-
