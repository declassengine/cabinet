Ifjrr TPADE 1.    The Attorney-General made a statement toIriON ANDIrADE DIS- the Cabinet on the proceedings in Standing CommitteejgrrPES BILL.of the House of Commons on the Trade Uni-on andjtprevious Trade Disputes Bill.    By introducing a series of[Reference:batinet 10 amendments which they had placed on the Order Paper(31),  Oon-clusion 2.) the Liberals had entirely altered what was understood to be their previous attitude.    After describing the Liberal amendments in detail, the Attorney-General,stated that he had been most positively assured byLiberal Members of the Committee that the fouramendments were not alternative but cumulative.He then read to the Cabinet the following draft,which he had already handed round to members,  setting out the cumulative effect of the Liberal amendmentson Clause I (!)(&amp;):-&quot;Any struke or lock-out of,whichthe effect at any time by reason ofits extension or continuance is to expose the community or any subs tan-tial portion of the community todanger to health or safety by inter-fering with the supplies or distribu-tion of essential food,, water, fuel,light, medical or sanitary services,or other necessities of life, shall thereupon become illegal and anystrike or lock-out of which a main(a substantial) object is an objectother than or in addition to the furtherance of a trade dispute,whether or not within the trade or industry in which the strike or lock-out takes place,   or any strike Orlock-put involving breach of contract of employment on the part either ofthe employers or of establishedemployees in a service scheduled inthis Acb or in any subsequent Act ofParliament as an essential publicservice,  shall be illegal, and itshall be illegal to commence, orcontinue, or to apply any sums in furtherance or support of, any suchillegal strike or lock-out.Where a proclamation of emergencyis made in accordance with the pro-visions of section one of theEmergency Powers Act, 1920, and the proclamation is expressed to havebeen made upon the ground that itappears to His Majesty that any&apos; strike or lock-out which has takenplace so seriously menaces, the health or safety of the community,
The Attorney-General stated that, with a view to giving the Cabinet the fullest possible information,he had taken steps to ascertain the views of theT.U.C, and,  apart from one representative whowas specially interested in the Clause relating tothe Civil Service, those whom he had consulted took the view that if the Government were defeated onClause 1 it would be advisable to drop the Bill.The critical Division would take place in StandingCommittee on the following day, Thursday,, February26th, at about 6-30 p.m., when the Government would almost certainly be defeated.   He wished guidancefrom the Cabinet as to -(i) what action he was to take if theGovernment were defeated in the division:(ii) what line he should take in speakingon the amendment.or the maintenance of the constitu-tion, as to constitute a nationaldanger, then notwithstanding any-thing in section two of that act the regulations made by His majesty in Council under that section may,as from the expiration of the periodof forty-eight hours after themaking of the regulations, prohibitall organisations of employers and workers from applying any sums in furtherance or support of the strike or lock-out, and may prohibit allpersons from instigating or incitingothers to take part in or otherwiseto act in furtherance of the strike or lock-out.   Provided that any regulations containing any suchprohibition as aforesaid shall require the Minister of Labourimmediately to refer for settle-ment under sub-section (2). ofsection two of the industrial courts Act, 1919, all matters in dispute (whether or not a trade dispute within the meaning of thatAct) between the parties engaged inthe strike or lock-out, and in anysuch case it shall not be necessaryfor any party to the dispute to consent to the reference and sub-section (4)  of that section shallnot apply,&quot;
^he Cabinet app- eclated that the effect of theLiberal amendments would be to create a situationworse, from the Government&apos;s point of view,  thanthat existing after the Act of 1927;    worse,  indeed,than after the Liberal Act of 1906.   The cabinet were also informed that there was no room for doubtthat the provisions as to political funds would be rejected by the Liberals,  and that they showed astrong disposition to retreat from the indicationthey had given of the possibility of an accommoda-tion as to the provisions in regard to CivilServants and employees of Local Authorities .Various alternative courses were discussed bythe Cabinet,    One proposal was that, immediatelyafter a defeat  in the critical Division on Thursdayevening,  the Government should annoiince the with-drawal of5 the Bill.    This course was advocated onthe ground that it would be better to recognise the inevitable at once rather than to face furtherhumiliations and defeats.    On a wider view of thepolitical considerations involved, however,. thiscourse did not commend itself to the Cabinet as awhole, who also felt that it would not be rightto take so important a decision in the absence ofthe Prime Minister and several of their colleagues.The Cabinet also rejected the idea of there be in.p: no statement at all, for in that event theGovernment would be exposed, to much criticism duringthe week-end and before the next meeting of theS t.andinc Committ ee .A third plan, to make no announcement beforethe critical Division but for the Cabinet to review the situation immediately after the Division hadbeen taken, was also not adopted.
A proposal which proved, more attractive than any ofthe above was that the Attorney-General should be author-is ed to announce beforehand that in the event of thepassage of the official Liberal amendment on mhursdayevening the Government would desire, notwithstanding theirdefeat, to continue the discussion of every clause of theBill,  in order to ascertain the form in which it would emerge from Committee.   This plan was advocated on theground that the attitude of each of the Opposition Partiestowards the Bill as a whole would thereby be revealed.    Itwas felt, however, that it was unnecessary for the Cabinetto decide on such a step at the present Meeting, and thatin the absence of so many of their colleagues it was undesirable to do so,An alternative course to the above was that the attorney-General should make a similar announcement, butconfined to Clause 1 fIllegal Strikes and Lockouts):that  is to say, he should announce the Intention of theGovernment to continue the discussion of all the amendments to Clause 1,  in order to ascertain their cumulative effect.After considerable discussion on the political and other aspects of&apos; the question, the Cabinet agreed  fa) That the Attorney-General should be author-ised, in the course of the Debate and beforethe Division in Standing Committee, toindicate, first, that if the official Liberalamendments were passed, the Government would propose to pass to the discussion of other amendments in order to see their cumulative effect, but he should not define preciselywhether he referred to Clause 1 only or tothe rest o^ the Bill.   By these means time would be gained for further considerationafter the return of the Prime Minister:(b) That the Attorney-General should be author-is ed to set forth and emphasise the cumulative effect of the Liberal amendments:(c) That the Attorney-General should be author-is ed, preferably in concert with some memberof the Cabinet interested in this question,to give an indication to the T.U.C. of theline the Government proposed to adopt.
CINEMAS.Sunday Per-formanCes .^abbath Dayfub s ervanc e .(previous reference:Cabinet 14(31&apos;), Con-elusion 10.)a.2.    At the previous Meeting of the Cabiiret &quot;r^err^erT^to  in the margin it had been arranged that the HomeSecretary should -(a) consult the Law Officers as tothe present position of the law, and (b) enter into consultation with the Leaders of the Opposition inthe House of Commons in regard to the difficult situation which had arisen out of the recent judgement in the Courts on the question of the Sunday openingof cinemas and other places of entertainment, andshould discuss with them the proposals in his Memo-randum CP.-48 (31).    In a new Memorandum (CP.-60(31)) the Home Secretary reported that the Attorney-General was In entire agreement with the view expressed by his own advisers at the Home office that the Sunday Observance Act, 1780, would applyto any public meeting,, political or otherwise, or toany form of public entertainment or amusement towhich persons are admitted by payment of money orby tickets sold for money, and that the Attorney-General was also in favour of steps being taken tobring the law into harmony with public dpinion atthe earliest possible moment.As regards the Leaders of the Opposition,Mr Baldwin was in general agreement with the pro-posals set out in the Home Secretary?s earlier Memo-randum (0.P.-48 (31)), and inclined to the view thatthe question of the inclusion of theatres should beleft to a free vote of the House.   Mr Lloyd George,on the other hand, reported that his Party were divided on the question, but the Home Secretarygathered that Mr Lloyd George, if he voted at all,would probably support a Bill on the lines proposedin CP.-48 (31), and that in his view the decision should be left freely to the House.
The Home Secretary recommended that legislation should be introduced to enable Local Authorities to restore the status quo so far as concerns cinemasand concerts, and that the question of the theatresshould be left to a free vote.    If legislation wasto be introduced he strongly recommended, with thesupport of the Attorney-General, that provision should be made to deal retrospectively with the numerous actions which had recently been instituted by common informers suing for penalties for infringe-ments of the Sunday Observance Act, the totalpenalties claimed in which actions would amount to several million pounds .Some members of the Cabinet felt that itwould be preferable to take no action at all, ifsuch a course were practicable, rather than to risk raising a controversy on the Sabbath DayObservance by introducing a Government bill.There was general agreement, however, with theview of the Attorney General that great confusionwould arise if no action were taken.The Cabinet agreed:-(a) That the Home Secretary should draft a Bill, on the lines of his memoranda,with a view to the restoration ofthe status quo before the recentJudgment in the Courts;    its provisions being limited to the Sunday opening of cinemas and the holding of concerts,for(b) That any condition applying the Bill/example, to    theatres or other places of entertainment,  should beleft for Private Members to move ifthey so desired.(c) That the whole Bill should be left\ to a Free Vote of the House ofCommons.
(d) That the Secretary of State forScotland, who hod called for aReport on the subject from the lord advocate, should inform the HomeSecretary, before the Bill is drafted,as to how far,  if at all,  it should bemade to apply to Scotland.
WIDOWS?  PENSIONS.    3.     At the Meeting of the Cabinet referred toTitle to Pen- in the margin it had been arranged that the Minister&quot;sion under the contributory       of Health should sound the Leaders of the OppositionPensions Act,1929. Parties with a view to facilitating the passage of aBill,  as proposed in his Memorandum C.P.-39 (31))(previous reference: and should report the result to the Cabinet at thisCabinet 14(31),  Con-        Meeting,conclusion ion 9.)rei The Minister of Health informed the^6&apos;)/v Cabinet that he had not yet been able to sound the Leaders of the Opposition Parties and theCabinet agreed to adjourn the question until their next meeting.-p-
4. The Cabinet had before them a Note by thePrime Minister on the subject of the -stibmisaion ofbusiness to the Cabinet (C.P49 (31)) recommendinghis colleagues to approve the issue to all Departmentb&quot;of a proposed Treasury Circular on the subject.The object of this Circular was to draw attentiononce more to the Treasury Circular of April 28,  1924,and to emphasise the importance of securing that alldraft Pills are fully examined by the Departmentsconcerned before they are circulated to the Committeeof Home Affairs.One or two Members of the Cabinet pointed outthat the exigencies of politiQ&amp;l life often made it impossible to comply with the terms of the circular.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER explained,however, that in such cases the Prime minister had discretion to make an exception.    Latterlysuch exceptions had become too frequent, and itwas desired to draw the attention of GovernmentDepartments to the necessity from the point ofview of the good conduct of Cabinet business ofadhering as closely as possible to the rules laiddown.The Cabinet agreed:-To authorise the issue to all departments of the Treasury Circular.
5. The Cabinet had before them the following documents on the subject of the rehabilitation ofthe Chinese Railways:-The First Report of a Committeeof the Economic Advisory Councilon the Chinese Situation (C.P.-8(3D):An Extract from the 11th Conclusionsof the Economic Advisory Council(G .P.-56(31)) recommending that theBritish Minister in Peking shouldbe asked to show a copy of theabove Report,  in confidence, toSir Arthur Salter on his arrival in China (which he was visitingat the request of the ChineseGovernment) and to inform Sir Arthurthat His Majesty&apos;s Government wouldbe glad if he would furnish themwith a statement of his views onthe recommendations contained inthe Committee&apos;s Report and gener-ally on the question of foreignloans to China:    also that theForeign Office should informSir Charles Addis privately ofthe action proposed to be taken:A Note by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs  (CP.-57 (31))suggesting that as Sir Arthur Salter,during his stay in China, would bethe confidential adviser of theChinese Government,  it mightembarrass him to be asked by HisMajesty&apos;s Government at that moment&quot;^or his views on such questions as foreign Loans to China.   The ForeignOffice therefore suggested that sir Miles Lamps on should merely be instructed to show Sir Arthur Salterin confidence a copy of the Committee&apos;sReport, but that nothing furthershould be said, to him until he had left China.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOiERD OF TRADE saidthat the Bill was now before the House of Lords.He would report in due course to the economic advisory Council and to the Cabinet as to thefurther action to be taken.    He informed the china.The Rehab iii-tation of theChinese Rail-ways .(previous reference:Cabinet 6(31), Con-clusion 6.)

REDUCTION AND 6. The Cabinet had before them a Joint.LIMITATION OFARMAMENTS. Memorandum by the Prime Minister,  the secretaryof State for 1*0reign Affairs and the First LordNaval Disarmament.of the Admiralty (CP.-54 (31) reporting the(previous reference- present position of the Naval conversationsCabinet 11 , ^ , T^ ,        , ,, , , ,(31), Con- between France and Italy and their relationelusion 2.)to the London Naval Treaty resulting fromnegotiations carried out by Mr. Craigie, of theForeign Office.    At the end of the memorandum it was stated that the three Minister had agreed -(i) That it was essential that Mr. Craigieshould proceed at once to Rome toreport the position arrived at inParis to date:(ii) That the Prime Minister should take an early opportunity of informing the U.S.A. and Japanese Ambassadorsof the position: and(iii) That if lir, Orai(?ie refjorts that italy accepts the French proposals in principle, we should immediatelycall a meeting of representatives ofthe Five-Power Conference to considerMr, CraigieTs report in relation tothe London Treaty.Shortly before the end of the meetingcopies of Lord Tyre11ls very confidential and secret telegram No.28 of February the 25th vrerehanded round.    In this telegram the Secretaryof State for   Foreign Affairs reported theresult of conversations which he and the FirstLord of the Admiralty had held in Paris.    It was stated that a provisional agreement had beenreached subject to the concurrence of the UnitedStates,Japanese and Italian Governments.    full particulars of the provisional agreement were included and it was stated on the face of&quot;the telegram that it had been addressed to Washington
and Tokio.    The two Ministers had left Parisfor Rome to discuss the provisional agreementwith the Italian Government.In the absence of all the Ministers whohad been closely concerned in these matters,the Cabinet did not feel that they could usefullypursue the matter, but agreed -That the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs should be authorisedto repeat the telegram for the veryconfidential and secret informationof the Governments of the Dominions.

The two Ministers had asked the representatives present to consider whethermatters would be helped if one or more outstandingbusiness men went to Lancashire with the object ofendeavouring, in consultation with the various sections of the industry, to produce a scheme of re-organisation which would include proposals for the regulation of productive capacity.
