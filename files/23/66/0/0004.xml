2. The President of the Board of Trade reported the results of his meeting with the representativesof the miners on the previous evening ^ which had continued until 9-30 p.m.   The discussion had beenlong and rather difficult.   The President had made clear that the Government were making no recommenda-tions, and had apprised the miners&apos; representativesquite impartially of the facts of his meeting withthe mine-owners during the afternoon.    The courseof the meeting had shown unquestionably that thedecision of the Cabinet to make no recommendationhad been a right one.   The miners&apos; representatives had taken the view that the mine-owners had not changed their attitude as outlined at the end ofthe meeting in South Wales on Saturday.     TheGovernment representatives had then pointed outthat the owners had now withdrawn from their offer of January 3rd even the conditions as regardsarbitration;    the question arose, therefore, as towhether the two parties could get back to some method of conciliation, and in this connection thepossibility of procedure under the Industrial Courthad been mentioned.   The miners&apos; representatives had adhered strongly to the recommendation of theNational Industrial Board,  and the suggestion of using the machinery of the Industrial Courts Actdid not appeal to them.    They evidently did not regard it as in any way a higher tribunal than theNational Industrial Board.    The Government repre-sentatives&quot; nad then brought the discussion back tothe proposed use of the Conciliation Board procedure.The apprehension of the miners&apos; representatives wastftaat at any resumed proceedings the owners might
merely revert to their previous attitude.   ThePresident of the Board of Trade had then pointedout that there was just a chance that the ownersmight Ufv.......b-o narrow the ground on the question of wage reduction with a view to a subsequent adjust-ment of the question of hours.   Mr Richards,  forthe miners, had said that the matter of a few pencemtotkNI not trouble them, but had then reverted tothe decision of the National Industrial Board.The officials of the Mines Department held the viewthat if the reduction of a few pence could be negotiated it might enable results to be achieved by Conciliation procedure.   The miners had not been willing to meet the owners direct under their ownConciliation procedure, but had eventually agreedto meet at the Board of Trade.   After communicationwith the owners it had been arranged that a fewofficials representing the employers, on the onehand,  and the employed on the other, should meet at the Board of Trade under the Chairmanship ofthe President at 10-30 a.m. that morning.   Theobject of the meeting was to find a basis for the resumption of a meeting of the Conciliation Boardeither in London or in South Wales .    The owners were prepared to enter the discussion with a cleansheet, and not on the basis of any previous documents.The position of the miners was the same.    It was hoped that the mine-owners might be willing tonarrow the ground on the question of wages .    the mine-owners were particularly desirous of achievingfinality.
Tn the course of the discussion which foil-ccedthe President of the Board of Trade&apos;s statementit was suggested, that the time was approaching whenthe coal situation should be considered from theviev ofpoint of/July next, when the time of working wouldbe reduced automatically to seven hours .   unless this was faced soon there might be greater confusionthan ever in the near future.    To the owners, whomake contracts for 12 months ahead,  a settlement would appear indispensable.Afterwards the discussion became of a more general character, and the various alternative courses open to the Government were considered, fromthe point of View of their bearing both on theindustrial policy of the Government and on thepolitical situation.&quot;he Cabinet agreed  (a) That the President of the Board ofTrade should continue his negotia-tions and that members of theCabinet should hold themselves in readiness in case he should requireguidance at short notice during theday:(b) To meet on the following day,Thursday,  January 8th, at 10Downing Street, at 9-30 a .m.(The President  of the Board of Trade under-took to telephone the position to the PrimeMinister, who was keeping a politicalengagement  in the Provinces, between 5and 6 p .m .)Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I,January 7, 1931
