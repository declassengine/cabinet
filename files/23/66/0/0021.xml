THB GOAL0DUSTRY.&quot;previous reference:Cabinet 19(51), Con-conclusion 3.)1. The Cabinet resumed consideration of theposition in the Coal Industry, more particularly with reference to Scotland.The Secretary for Mines reported that theExecutive of the Miners&apos;  Federation had met that morning and had decided not to depart from thedecision of the Delegate Conference against theworking of a spread-over.   They had also decidedthat their officials should approach the Miners&apos;Members of Parliament and discuss with them thepossibilities of a Minimum Wage Bill, reporting theresult to the Executive of the Miners&apos;  Federation.This, however, could not take place until after easter.   After that it was probable that they wouldapproach the Government, subject to what theMembers of Parliament had to say.In the afternoon there had been a joint meetingof the Executive of the Miners&apos; Federation and ofthe Mining Association.   The meeting had been heldin a friendly atmosphere, although the results hadbeen meagre.   The Secretary for Mines was informedthat the question of the International Conventionhad been discussed, and the Mine Owners had asked the Miners&apos; Federation to assist in securing thatthe British position was not prejudiced.   A Committeehad been arranged to meet at the end of April inorder to discuss the question, after which theywould probably approach the Secretary for Mines.Mr Evan Williams was then reported to have stated the general position of the Owners, who were doing their utmost to work Part  I of the Coal Mines Actand to bring more money into the industry .Mr Williams had then wished to discuss the position
in July.   The Miners&apos; Federation, however, hadwanted to discuss the immediate position, includingthe spread-over, but the Owners would not agree.He was informed that Mr Tom Richards had then askedfor a Sub-Committee to discuss these matters, andhad offered not to exclude the July position, butthe proposal had not been accepted.   The meetingthen came to an end.In the course of the discussion the Acting Chair-roan of the Scottish Owners had said that the intention was to work the spread-over, and the Secretary for mines now thought it not unlikely that the Scottishminers, at the Relegate Meeting of the Scottish Mine-Workers&apos; Union on Saturday, might agree to work the spread-over, although efforts were being made to avertsuch a decision.    It was possible, also, that asimilar situation might arise in North Wales and somesmaller districts in England.   mhe position, however,would not be known definitely until after the delegate Meeting on Saturday, the results of whichwould take effect on Wednesday, April 1st.If the spread-over were operated, the courses open to the Government were (i) to prosecute, or(ii) to keep the prosecutions in suspense for a brief period pending negotiations, or (iii) to getthe parties to agree.   Possibly, however, some considerable percentage of the miners might refuseto work the spread-over and accept UnemploymentBenefit.    In that event the Owners would probablypost notices for a       hours day at reduced wages .The course which the Secretary for Mines sug-gested as a basis for disoussion was that in thefirst instance the Prime Minister should see Mr Evan Williams and discuss with him the position inJuly, and sound him as to the advisability of his
seeing representatives of the Central Committeeof the Coal Owners,  on which the Scottish owners were represented, with a view to exploring on theOwners&apos;  side in the first instance the possibilitiesof a comprehensive settlement covering both Julyrnd the immediate situation.This course, however, was criticised as being tooslow.   The situation likely to arise on Wednesday,April 1st, was urgent, since on that date it seemed probable that the illegal working of the spread-overwould be widely in operation in Scotland.    It wassuggested that the Government could not face a situation in which the Act passed so recently ontheir own initiative was being flagrantly and openlyviolated.    One difficulty of prosecutions, however,was that they might only result in the inflictionof small fines, and another that the result of prosecutions might be to stop work on a basis that had been agreed by both sides and to throw greatnumbers of workers on to Unemployment Benefit.In any event the situation was one in which prompt-aotion was required, both in order to preventillegality and to avoid a further deterioration ofthe situation.    It was pointed out also that a difficult parliament?mentary situation might be created.Even before Parliament rose for the Easter Recessthe question was likely to be raised as^ to what action the Government proposed in the event of a continued infraction of the law.   It was suggested,however, that Parliament would be satisfied if itwas explained that the Government was in touchwith the two parties and in the meantime did not wish to destroy their hopes of a settlement by undertaking prosecutions .   Precedents for this
course could be found.    It was urged, however, that conversations with Mr Evan Williams and the central committee of the Owners would not be regarded asbearing sufficiently closely on the immediate problem of Scotland to satisfy public opinion.This dilemma,  it was recognised, could be avoidedif a temporary spread-over in Scotland was legalised,and the hey to the situation was felt to lie withthe Miners&apos; Federation.   Various suggestions weremade in this connection, but the idea which mostcommended itself was that if the Scottish minersdecided on Saturday to operate the spread-over theproper course was to approach the Executive of theMiners&apos; Federation, and, notwithstanding their present attitude, to try and induce them to agree to atemporary spread-over in Scotland for a period of afew? weeks in order to gain time for negotiationswith a view to a comprehensive settlement not only of immediate difficulties but also of the positionafter the end of June.    It could be pointed out tothe Miners&apos; Federation that the present difficulty had arisen out of Clauses in the Act that had been inserted in order to assist the miners;    that it hadbeen made clear at the time that the Federation wouldhave to face any economic consequences that might result^ and that in the circumstances they ought tomake some contribution towards a settlement.   Theidea was mooted that in the last resort it might benecessary for the Government themselves to sanctiona temporary working of the spread-over, coveringthemselves either by prior legislation or an Act ofIndemnity, in either case after notification tothe MinersT Federation.
The Secretary for Mines, while not opposing theplan of meeting the Executive of the Miners&apos;Federation, warned the Cabinet that they were likelyto point out that they had already consented to atemporary spread-over in certain cases, but, so faras the July position was concerned, without result.Further, he stated that the Executive of the Miners&apos;Federation could hardly meet before Tuesday, as itwould be inexpedient to send the invitation beforethe result of Saturday&apos;s Conference of ScottishMiners was known:    in any event the Executive wouldbe powerless to act without summoning a delegate conference, which would take two or three days.The time required for this might be reduced if aprivate warning of the need were given to the officials of the Federation.   He himself^ however,was inclined to deprecate any precipitate action,owing to the difficulty of foreseeing how thesituation might develop in the next week or two,and he still preferred his plan of meeting Mr EvanWilliams in the first instance   a suggestion onwhich the Prime Minister desired to have time forfurther reflection.The Cabinet agreed  That the Prime Minister should seeinformally Mr Tom Richards and certainrepresentatives of the Executive ofthe Miners&apos; Federation who were stillin London on the following morning at 10-45 a.m., and that the Secretaryfor Mines should make the necessary arrangements.
VOTE OPCENSURE,previous reference:Cabinet 19(31), Con-elusion 4(e) .)2.    The Cabinet agreed  That the Prime Minister and the lord privy Seal should speak on the vote of Censure on Unemployment to be moved by the Opposition next &quot;week, and thatthe Lord Privy Seal should consult theParliamentary Secretary to the treasury as to the intervention in the Debate ofother speakers .2, Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.1,March 25,  1931.
