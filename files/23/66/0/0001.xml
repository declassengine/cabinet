2.    The President of the Board of Trade made areport to the Cabinet in regard to the serious situation in the South Wales coalfield.      The matter had been referred to the National Industrial Boardand the miners were willing to accept their gfward,.The owners, however, had never recognised theNational Industrial Board, and consequently had declined to accept its award, adding, however,  thatin any event it was of such a character that theycould not have accepted it.      A stoppage had takenplace, which was practically complete except for&quot;safety&quot; men.      A conference had taken place atCardiff on the previous Saturday, when the owners had made certain proposals, including conciliation,on a district basis, and,  if that were not success-ful within ten days, arbitration,  the award in whichwould be binding, coupled with terms as to the continuation of work in the meanwhile.      The minerscould not accept the owners&apos;  terms.      The Presidentof the Board of Trade and the Lord Privy Seal had,on the previous afternoon, seen representatives ofthe miners, who had in effect pressed that theGovernment should take steps  to insist on the carrying out of the award of the National IndustrialBoard.      The difficulty was that the owners maintained    Ithat to carry out the award v/ould involve an actualloss, which they could not afford.      The Presidentof the Board of Trade reported that three repre-sentatives of the mine-owners were on their wayficra Wales to see him and that an interview hadbeen arranged for If p.m.  the same afternoon.After some discussion as to whether the cabinet could do anything, and,  if so, what,  to strengthen the hands of the President of the Board of Trade
before his interview with the mine-owners, theCabinet agreed  (a) To re*-assemble th.e same day at p.m, to continue the discussion:(b) To re-assemble again at 5-30 p0c,the same day to hear the report ofthe President of the Board of Traderegarding his interview with the mine-owners .2, Whitehall Gardens,  S,W,1,January 6, 19 31.
