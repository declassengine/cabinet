THE indian round-table conference.(previous reference:Cabinet 71(30), Con-clusion 18) .The GeneralPolicy.The Hindu-MoblemControversy .1. The Cabinet had before them a Most secret draft Statement by His MajestyTs Government (C.P.-10 (31)), circulated by direction of the PrimeMinister, setting forth the view of His majesty&apos;s government in respect of the policy to be adopted as the res-alt of the Indian Round-Table ponference.The Prime Minister explained that, broadly speaking and subject to the exception of the passage in paragraph 2, referred to below and relating to finance, the first four paragraphs of the draft statement represented what had been agreed at the round-Table Conference.   The later paragraphs9 whileindicating the general line of approach towardsagreement likely to be reached, were liable to amendment in accordance with the results of thefurther deliberations of the Conference.In regard to Paragraph 1. the Prime minister pointed out that this general declaration, that theresponsibility for the government of India.shouldbe placed upon Legislatures, Oentral and Provincial,subject to the necessary guarantees, was essential if the work of the Round-Table Conference was toproceed at all.   The alternative was trouble of amost serious character in India.It was suggested that unless the declarationwere made conditional on a present or future settlement of the difficulties between Hindus andMohammedans, the only result of the Conference wouldin Indiabe to produce a situation/worse than before,,   Onthis point the lord Chancellor gave the Cabinet full particulars of the demands of the Mohammedans,first they wished to have a predominant positionin the four Northern Provinces of India, where theywere in a majority, in order to be able to retaliate-1-
if their -eo-religionist s -were maltreated in Prc-vinees where they were in a minority.     In addition.they wished to he secured in the Central executive and in the Federal Legislature in order to safeguardthemselves against alterations in the electoralsystem which might result from their using theirmajority in the four Northern Provinces .   When itwas suggested that these powers might be accorded toMohammedans if they could settle the communal differ-ences they had intimated that this was impossible.The Prime Minister said that the proposal, made fromthe Findu side, that the Prime Minister himselfshould arbitrate between the T^osleirs and Hinduswas not  a practicable one, as whoever the arbitratorwas he would lose all authority in India in future.In the course of the discussion interestingparticulars were given of the attitude of prominentMohammedan and Hindu representatives,  and the hopewas expressed that the risk of serious Hindu-Mohammedan trouble in India after the conference would be diminished by the existence of a blockof such persons occupying rather a central positionin the controversy whose influence would be used against the extreirists .The Statement was then discussed in detailparagraph by paragraph.e Financial In regard to Paragraph I the question was raisedobi em .as to whether the United Kingdom financial situation was sufficiently safeguarded by the following phrase:--* &quot;with such immediate provisions as maybe necessary to guarantee,  during aperiod of transition, the observance of certain obligations and to meet-other special circumstances as maybe agreed upon&quot; .
The Prime Minister explained that the indian representatives at the Conference were willing togive specific, guarantees to secure our position inregard to particular obligations, provided that these were not to continue in perpetuity.   These obliga-tions, however, must,  in course of time, come to anend, and that necessitated a transition period,however long it might be.In regard to the portion of Paragraph 2 relatingto finance, the Prime Minister pointed out that.thiswas  only in general terms and would be revised to correspond with the final form of this part of theReport of Lord Sankey&apos;s Federal Structure Sub-Committee.    The draft of this latter Report, whichwas to come before the full Conference in Committeeon the morrow, had been prepared in the first instance in the India Office, submitted to the Treasury, and afterwards discussed by Lord Sankey with the Chancellorof the Exchequer.    If alterations were made, as he understood might be necessitated by the attitude ofIndian representatives, they would be submitted &quot;tothe Chancellor of the Exchequer, and if necessary thework of the Conference on this point would be Qus-pended  for this purpose.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that this procedure was satisfactory to him.Paragraph 5, the Prime Minister pointed out inreply to questions, subject to one modificationcarried out in the main the recommendations of theSimon Report in respect of the constitution of the governors&apos; Provinces on a basis of full responsibility.Such variations as had been made were based on theDespatch of the Government of India or were theresult of friendly exchanges of view.    The question
of franchise was being dealt with by a separateSub--Commit t e e.Paragraph 4 did not call for any comment .For Paragraphs 5 to the end, see the statement made in the second paragraph of this Minute.-On the general position the Prime minister  explained that the proposed Statement was to be madeon behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government only.    Therepresentatives of the Conservatives and Liberalshad already made their respective statements .As to future procedure the Prime minister pointed out that while the Statement to be ma.de nextof policyMonday would lay down the general lines/, there was acertain amount of detail still to be worked out .The big outstanding question was the Hindu-Moslemcontroversy,, which he hoped to get broadened out by-adopting a suggestion that had been made that thedepressed classes should not be reckoned as Hindus..In that way a new class would be formed.For the rest, he intended to propose that thework of the Conference should go on,, and that theViceroy should be instructed to continue in India the investigation of the various points begun in London,using the Minutes of the Round-Table Conference as abasis for discussion.    In the meantime the study ofthe Constitutional problems would be continued inLondon.   Then, later on, there would be are-assembly of the Conference in London, unless itwas found possible for some British Ministers(for example, the Lord Chancellor and the Secretaryof State for India) to visit India, there to clear up the outstanding points, as desired by indian representatives.    He had had to reject as impracticable-cable a proposal for an immediate visit by the
United Kingdom Ministers.In the meantime a good deal of progress  could bemade by the India Office in the direction of givingthe Provinces more authority than they had at present.Much could be accomplished in this direction by meansof Administrative Order and/or Parliamentary Resolu-tion.    Pie proposed to start that work at once and tomake an announcement to that effect to the Round-table conference on Monday.The Simon Report, the Prime Minister stated, had proved of the utmost value, but new factors had arisenwhich had prevented its recommendations being adhered to:    for example, the decision of the Indian Princesin favour of co-operation in a Federal system, whichthe members of the Simon Coir.iii.is si on had done their best to promote but which was a new factor of theutmos t importanc e.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To instruct their representatives atthe Round-Table Conference to continue their task and to wind up the Conferenceon the lines on which they are now working:(b) That as regards finance,  the statement to be made on behalf of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should be brought into line with the Report of Lord Sahkey&apos;s FederalStructure Sub-C or/mitt ee,  and that ifthe passage on finance in the draft report should have to be amended, theChancellor of the Exchequer should bebrought into consultation before theReport was finally approved:(c) That the Secretary should arrange withthe Seeretary-General o^ the Round-table conference for the circulation to theCabinet o^ the various draft and final.  Reports and Minutes at the earliestpossible moment during the final stages of the conference.
2.      The President of the Board of &quot;Trade gave the Cabinet full particulars of the difficultieswhich had arisen in connection with a settlement inthe South Wales Coalfields, since the last meetingof the Cabinet.      These difficulties had arisen atthe meeting of the old Conciliation Board in Cardiff,The trouble arose out of the precise meaning of clause 3 of the basis of agreement.      The only possible course had proved to be to invite bothsides to come to London.      He had been in conference with them during the last two days and up till1U20 a.m.  the same morning.      In the course ofhis statement on the details the President of theBoard of Trade said that at one point therepresentatives of the miners had asked for an interview with the Prime Minister,  in the hope ofobtaining from him a promise that the Governmentwould enforce the recommendation of the national industrial Board.      He had replied that the PrimeMinister could only give the same reply as he hadalready given, namely,  that there was no hope ofobtaining a settlement along those lines;    that without legislation it vrauld be impossible to enforce therecommendation of the National Industrial Board;that it would have serious reactions elsewhere;    thatit would lead to financial responsibility being incurred by the Government;    and that it would notsettle the present dispute.He asked the Cabinet to confirm his attitude onthis point.      In the course of a short discussion on this request,  it was pointec. out that before adecision to enforce the recommendation of theNational Industrial Board it would be necessary to
enter into negotiations with the Miners&apos; federation as it was doubtful if they would accept theproposal, which amounted to compulsory arbitration.After the President of the Board of trade had given details of the lines  on which he was seeking a settlement,  the Cabinet agreed  (a) To confirm the statement madeto the representatives of theMiners by the President of theBoard of Trade and summarised above, as to the impracticabilityof the Government1s giving anundertaking to enforce therecommendation of the KationalIndustrial Board;(b) That the President of the Boardof Trade should continue his negotiations with a view to asettlement;(c) To express their appreciation of the efforts  of the Presidentof the Board of Trade to effect a settlement.-(-
EDUCATION.The Voluntary-lb chools Question.(previous Reference:I Cabinet 731(JO),  Con-Iclusi on 3)&apos;3.      In view of the large number of urgentquestions to be settled by the Cabinet at thismeeting, the President of the Board of Educationdid not report the progress made at hisconference on the Voluntary Schools Question.      Heindicated, however,  that it would be important for him to obtain a decision from the Cabineton the conclusion of his conference,  and not later than Tuesday, January 20th.
EE FINANCIAL 4.    The Cabinet had-before them a Most SecretITUATION.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerPrevious (C.P0-S (31)) setting forth the facts of the reference:Cabinet 22 financial situation with special reference to the(30),  Con-clusion 1.) Budget prospects for 1931.The Chancellor of the Exchequer made a longstatement to the Cabinet in elaboration of theMemorandum he had circulated,  in the course ofwhich he emphasised the gravity of the financial situation, both on the revenue and expendituresides,  and in addition in its bearing on our international credit.      On the revenue side he       -pointed out &quot;that taxation was already so high thatan increase  night bring us to the point of /diminishing returns.      On the expenditure aspectthe main difficulties arose in connectionwith expenditure on Unemployment.      He had prepared proposals under this and other heads,but they involved, questions of policy,  and hethought the matter ought first to be considered in these aspects by the Cabinet.A discussion of a preliminary characterfollowed, and it was recognised that largeeconomies.could only be ac ievea by changes in policy.      In respect of defence,  it was pointedout that the.policy of the country could not bedrav/n up in isolation from the policies of othercountries, and that in view more particularly ofthe coming Disarmament Conference great cautionwould have to be exercised in regard to reductions in the defence forces.
The Cabinet, recognising that the financial situation was very serious, and urgent, and        &apos;with a view to further discussion, agreed  That the president of the Boardof Trade and the First Lord ofthe Admiralty should be asked toco-operate with the Chancellorof the Exchequer in a preliminary consideration of&quot; the situation;that the three Ministers shouldbe empowered to co-opt other ministers as they might thinkadvisable;    and that, beforemeeting,  each Minister shouldformulate any specific proposals he might have to&quot; offer.-to-
THE FCJLEAMPOWER STATION(previous reference:Cabinet 66(30), Con-elusion 2.)- ^   155.   The Cabinet had before them a Joint Memo-randum by the Minister of Health, the First Conmais-sioner of Works and the Minister of Transport(CP.-9 (31)) stating that the ElectricityCommissioners had held a Public Inquiry into theproposal of the Fulham Borough Council to extend their power station, and that in view of the esti-mated require/rents of electricity in the West london district in the next few years there is a clear case,both on technical and financial grounds,  in favourof the proposed extension o^ the Fulham power stationas  compared with any possible alternative arrange-ment.    In this Memorandum it was proposed that theElectricity Commissioners&apos; consent should be givenforthwith to the extension on the conditionsspecified in the Appendix to the Memorandum,providing, inter alia, for the employment of thebest known methods, available, from time to.time for   ,idksu 4)&amp;^T^Xo(kv*-^- l*^x^a*Jrtu&amp;^W (pern (PhJLto U/n^^aTthe elimination of smoke and grij^. and^the removalof sulphur, and for adequate inspection under theauthority of the Departments concerned.In the course of the discussion, it wassuggested that one of the most serious risks inthe proposal was the contamination of the Thameswater by sulphides in the effluent.      The cabinet were informed that this matter had been raised bythe Port of London Authority,  and that the measures for dealing with this question would be subjectto their requirements.The Cabinet approved the proposalsof the Minister of Health,  the first commissioner of Y/orks and theMinister of Transport, as set forth inC.P. 9 (31)* and summarised above,-1 1-(NO^The Prime Minister left the cabinet at this point).

It had been found that,in order to give effect to any such proposal, a clausecontaining some six sub-sections would have to beadded to the Bill, and the conclusion had been reached that for the present this proposal could not befurther pursued.At&apos;the meeting of the Committee of Home affairs it had been pointed out that the first schedule ofthe draft Bill contained proposed rules for theAlternative Vote that differed considerably frompreviouslythose^proposed    and approved by the Cabinet.

NEXT MEETING 1^-.      In order to meet the requirements of theOP THECABINET,, President of the Board of Education for a decision in connection with the conference on the VoluntarySchool question,  (Sec Conclusion 3),  the cabinet agreed  To meet on the afternoon ofTUESDAY,  JANUARY 20th,  in thePrime Minister&apos;s Room at theHOUSE OP COMMONS,  at 5.0 p.m.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.77.1.14-th January, 19.31.
E C BET.aPPEKBLX .CABINET-REPREbLNTATION OP THE PEOPLE B LL.THE ALTEBNATIVE VOTE.Nate by the home Secretary.At the Home Affairs Committee yesterday the question was raised whether the rules in the first Schedule of theBill carry out the real intention of the Cabinet in regardto the alternative vote.The rules contemplate that where there are more than three candidates an elector should be able to classifyall the cahdidetaa in the order of his preference.       the candidate who has the lowest number of first preferencesat the first count is eliminated;       the second preferenceson the eliminated candidates ballot papers are thendistributed to the remaining candidates.      There is then a second count.        If no candidate has a clear majorityof first and second preferences taken together, the candidate with the lewest number is then eliminated.The second preferences of the eliminated candidate are&apos;then transferred, but if the second preferences on theeliminated candidates ballot papers have been given infavour of a candidate who has already been eliminated,the third preference is then taken into account and is distributed accordingly.       The effect of the rules is toensure that every elector who has voted, for an. eliminatedCandidate should have an opportunity of making an effectivealternative choice between the candidates surviving atany stage of the proceedings. This means in simple-1-
language that if sxi elector&apos;-&apos;s^soc^iicL pj^e^erMmcc--has &quot;beerrgiven to a candidate wlic Is eliminated at any stage ofthe proceedings , then the elctor&apos;s third or fourthpreferences as the case may be, should he taken intoaccount. 1It is argued that to follow electors to express morethan two preferences was never contemplated, and thatthe real intention is shovn in the expression &quot;thealternative vote;&quot; - not &quot;votes&quot;.      It is argued further that to allow an elector to vote for all the candidatesin the order of his preference would he tantamount toconverting the single transferable vote system into a systemof proportional representation, aid that endlesscomplications would thereby be caused.It has been suggested therefore that an electorshould be allowed under the new Act to vote for only onecandidate in addition to his first choice.On the other hind, it should be pointed out thatif an elector is to be allowed to vote for only onecandidate in addition to his first preference, an elector!second choice might prove to be entirely ineffective.For example, in a contest where there are four candidates -A9 B, C9 and D - if an elector gives his votes in favourof 0 and D and if C and D are eliminated before the finalcount, it may be argued with some force that the electorwho has voted for C and D has had no opportunity cfgiving effective expression to his seCond choice, in thathe has had no say in the final choice between the twocandidates who remain after all the other candidates havebeen eliminated.      The system of the alternative voteas outlined by the Royal Commission of 1910 (and&quot; as is at
present in force in the -Commonwealth of Australia)contemplates that the alternative vote of an electorshould he exercised in deciding which of - the twoultimately surviving candidates should he returned toParliament..It is for the Cabinet to decide between(l) restricting the elector&apos;s choice to twocandidates;    and(2) allowing him to express his preference infavour of all the candidates with a view to ensuring that he should have a second say by the exerciseeither of his second or any other effective preferencat each stage of the proceedings.The first alternative certainly has the merit ofbeing by far the simpler and more easily understood bythe electorate, but the second alternative has the effectof giving an elector at every stage of the proceedingsan opportunity of a Pay in the election.(Int&apos;d)    J.R.C&apos;iiome Office, S.W. 1,January 14th, 1951.
