THE BUDGET. 1. The Prime Minister read a letter he hadDate o-p Cabinet received from the Chancellor op the Exchequer onMeeting on.the subject of the Budget Cabinet.   The Chancellor(Previous of the Exchequer, after considering the matter, had reference:Cabinet SI come to the conclusion that there was nothing in(31),  Con-elusion 4.)       connection with the present Budget to necessitatean alteration of the usual procediire of withholdinginformation until shortly before his Budget Speech.Ee was willing to come to London towards the end ofthe following week in order that he might make his statement to the Cabinet in advance of the date ofthe Budget Statement in Parliament on Monday, April27th.After the Prime Minister had communicated withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer by telephone,  theCabinet agreed  That, the Budget Cabinet should beheld on Friday, April 24th,  at p.mt, in the Prime Minister&apos;room at the Bouse of Commons .(NOTE:    The Prime Minister invited hiscolleagues to observe completereticence as to the contents of the Chancellor of theExchequer&apos;s letter.)
THE KING-&apos; birthday .The Secretaryof State forForeign Affairs&apos;Dinner .(previous reference:Cabinet 24(30)    Con-elusion 2 .)2, The Seeretary of State for Foreign affairs said that,  in view of the economy campaign, he wishedto mention the question of the usual Dinner at theForeign Office on the King&apos;s Birthday.   This wasthe only occasion on which the whole of theDiploma.tic Corps was entertained.    If the Dinnerwas to take place he would be glad if his colleagues would, as far as possible,  keep the date free.    he also hoped that they would reserve June 5th for aDinner to the German Chancellor and Foreign Minister.The Cabinet agreed  That the usual Dinner to the diplomatic corps should take place on the King&apos;birthday.
3. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs recalled that prior to the previous Meeting of theCabinet certain Papers had been circulated as amatter of urgency by the Foreign Office shortly before the Meeting, and some members of the cabinet had reported to him that they had been unable to open the boxes.    He had enquired into the matter atthe Foreign Office and had ascertained that the newkey had been issued to all members of the Cabinet.He felt somewhat disturbed that his colleagues hadbeen unable to open the boxes, for the reason that it-was of the first importance that the utmost preeau-tions should be taken for the security of these keysFor example,  they should never be left about,  and ifa Minister went abroad, even for a day,  the keyshould be left behind in a secure place.    If a keywere lost it was deemed necessary to replace thelocks on all the boxes,  which was an expensivematter .The Cabinet agreed  That all members of the cabinet should examine careftilly whetherthe various keys issued to them were in their personal possession,and in any case cf doubt should send their Private Secretaries tothe Foreign Office to enquire intothe matter.
REDUCTION and limitation of armaments .fifth e Franco-ItalianPosition.(previous reference:Cabinet 21(SI),  Con-conclusion ion 2 .)4. The secretary-erbary of State for Foreign affairs recalled that at the Meeting of the Cabinet referredto in the margin he had undertaken to communicate with M, briand as to the threatened breakdown inthe final stages of the Franco-Italian Agreement.He had done so,  and M. Briand, in reply, had scoutedthe idea of a break and had intimated that theFrench Government would make fresh proposals forresolving the difficulty.   Up to now this proposal was not forthcoming.    For the moment he gathered that consideration of the question in Paris had been postponed until the return of the Minister of Marinefrom Tunis.    Such indication as he had of the new proposal was that the French Government were likelyto offer a compromise in the form of replacement ofsixover-age tonnage in five years instead of/as provided in Article 19 of the London Naval Treaty.    Our view was that if the French wished to provide work intheir shipyards they ought to spread their presentconstruction over six years instead of four, andnot advance the replacement date.    He himself had given instructions that whenever the French proposalarrived it was not to be discussed in the first-instance by the Drafting Committee.    In his view it had passed out of that stage and was a matter for Ministers.    His information was that theItalians would not move from their present position,which was based on the London Naval Treaty and wasin accord with the following sentence at the end ofour own White Paper Cmd.3812 (1931):-&quot;In particular, no precedent is beingcreated for the final solution of thequestion whether and, if so, in what manner tonnage remaining over age onthe 31st December,  1936, may ultimatelyb e replac ed&quot;.
The Secretary of State thought it right to yarn hiscolleagues th^t the present prospects of a settlement where not very hopeful, and even that M. Rriand&apos;position seemed rather shaky.
REDUCTION and,IMITATION OFARMAMENTS.^previous reference:Cabinet SI(31), Con-clusion 2.)fx5.   The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that he felt he ought to warn the Cabinet thatthe general prospects of the Disarmament conference had suffered from the attitude of the French Govem-ment. towards the Franco-Italian Agreement, and hadbeen further aggravated by their unfortunate handling of the German-Austrian Customs Agreement.   He hoped,however, that advantage might be taken of the visit of the German Chancellor and Foreign Minister to recover the position.-6-
SPAIN.Abdication ofthe King.(previous reference:Cabinet 50(27), Con-clusion 2.)6.   The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that the King of Spain had abdicated, andthat both Fis Majesty and his family had left Madrid.The King would probably come to this country.   he anticipated that before long he would receive a request for recognition of the Spanish Government .
7 . The Cabinet had be-fore them a copy-of aletter from the Law Officers  of the Grown to theForeign Office (0.P.-86 (31)) containing an opinion by the Attorney-General as to whether the conclusionof a ^treaty between Germany and Austria establishing a Customs Union would be contrary to the treaty obligations of Austria under Article 88 of theTreaty of Saint-Germain or under the Protocol No.lsigned at Geneva on the 4th October,  1922, whichhad been circulated by direction of the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs.The Secretary of State ^or Foreign Affairs saidthat he was in communication with the President ofthe Board of Trade on the economic aspects of theproposed Customs Union.    Dr. Curtius,  the german foreign Minister, had expressed a willingness todiscuss the subject at a meeting of the european economic Committee of Inquiry to be held at geneva on the 15th May.    He himself was inclined to ask the European Economic Committee to appoint a Sub-Committee to go into the whole question.    Thatwould have the advantage of obviating the necessityfor full discussion at the Council with a probablereference of legal aspects to the international court at The Hague.    In the House of Commons he hoped to avoid cuotin.fr or publishing the Opinion ofthe Attorney-General, as he was anxious that thereshould not be a debate on this delicate question at the present time.    He proposed,  in reply to questions on the subject, to admit to having receivedthe Report of the Law Officers but, without givingits general tenor, to say that it confirmed thecorrectness of the policy of referring the question to the Council of the League of Nations.
The Cabinet were in entire agree-ent with thepolicy of the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs as summarised above.
agricultural policy.The HomeWheat QuotaScheme.(previous reference:Cabinet SI(31), Con-elusion 3.)8.  The Cabinet had before them the following documents relating to the Home Wheat Quota Scheme:The Interim Report of the CabinetCommittee on Agricultural Develop-ment (CP,-52 (31)) which hadalready been before the Cabinet:A Memorandum by the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries  (CP.-85(31)) covering a summary of the findings&apos; of the Permanent commissioner of Crown Lands reporting the existenceof serious agricultural depression inSouth-east Yorkshire:A Memorandum by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (C.P.-89 (31)) stronglycriticising the home wheat  quotascheme on the following grounds,among others:- That all our otherstaple industries are in a parlouscondition and equally entitled to claim State subsidies, so that a quota scheme could not be limitedto wheat,  or even oats, and wouldhave to be extended to industrieslike iron and steel:    that the planmust increase the price of bread and was undisguised Protection&quot;without the one benefit ofProtection in that it brings norevenue to the Exchequer&quot;:    thatthe pledge given in the government statement in the House of commons on August 1, 1930. was &quot;to undertakewhatever practicable steps can be devised to put cereal-growing inthis country on an economic foundation&quot;and that an industry which was toreceive a 100 per cent, subsidy wo;ildcertainly not be &quot;on an economicfoundation&quot;;   that the plan was opento strong political objection.The Chancellor of the Exchequerclosed his Memorandum by expressingan earnest hope that the cabinet would not accept the recommendationsof the Report.A general exchange of views on the wholeguest ion took place at the Cabinet, and manyarguments were adduced both in support of and against the proposal.In support of the wheat quota it was pointedout that it was essential for the Government to implement t$e August pledge, which applied specifically to cereal -growing *   No agricultural policy-PO-
would be on a sound or sufficient basis, or was likelyto succeed,  that did not recognise the position inthose areas where cereals are the principal crop.In those areas, as was generally admitted, wheat wasthe key crop.      It was in those areas,  too,  thatdepression and consequential unemployment and lo&quot;rwages were worst.      It had therefore been sought tofind some means, without tariffs or safeguarding,to improve the cereal position.      One fatal objectionto the adoption of Import Boards was that in Londonthere was a great international market for wheat,It was to meet these requirements that the quota plan had been produced.      The scheme was admitted to beworkable and would safeguard the position.      It mightbe accompanied by an announcement in due course linkingup the quota scheme with the agricultural labourer&apos;swages.      In those districts which were less dependenton wheat, wages were better than in the wheat areas.This was particularly the case in Scotland, whereperhaps better brains   -ere devoted to agriculture thanin England.      No alternative method of implementing the August pledge had yet been produced.      It was notdenied that the quota scheme would very slightlyincrease the price of bread, but if the price atwhich home-grown wheat were purchased was 45/- thiswould only involve a farthing increase in the priceof the if lb.  loaf.      This created no new principle,however,  as the Government&apos;s coal policy had involved arise in the price of coal, in order to assist the workers.In the course of the discussion it was also suggestedthat the principle of a subsidy had already been applied to agriculture by the sugar-beet policy
introduced by the Labour Government in 1924.    Oneadvantage claimed for the wheat quota scheme wasthat it would enable the Government to deal with theserious discrepancy existing between the price of flour and the price of bread, - a discrepancy whichhad increased by 2d. the price of the loaf sincethe War, and which could not be justified.The contention was traversed that the applicationof a quota to the case of wheat would necessarily involved its application to other commodities.   Wheat,it was claimed, was in a peculiar position, insomuchas before being consumed it had to undergo many otherprocesses, whereas oats, for example, were for themost part consumed almost in the raw state by horses.To the argument that the wheat quota involvedProtection it was replied that this was true of many other proposals, such as Import Boards.    It if weremade clenr, and well understood, that the wheat quota was intended to maintain the standard of*living of workers, the very small increase in thecost of the loaf ought not to be sufficient to render it unacceptable.    It was further pointed out thatthe Rome Wheat Conference had shown that success wasnot likely to a&apos;&apos;&quot; tend the attempts to restrict world production of wheat with a view to raising the price.The United States of America were only watching thediscussions., and Soviet Russia was unwilling to comeinto such a scheme.   World stocks were very high.Without some measure of this kind, therefore, therewas no prospect of a rise in prices which would enablewheat to be grown at home on an economic basis .No other proposal except the Wheat Quota scheme had been produced for dealing with this situationand enabling cereal growing&apos; at home to be maintained.
Without it, therefore, the Government would have to reconcile themselves to seeing wheat go out of cultivation.    Figures were given as to the largeproportion of the national income that was spenton such luxuries as drink, &quot;betting and tobacco,and it was suggested that the people would have torealise that it might be necessary to pay a littlemore for essentials.   Attention was drawn to the connection  between the quota for home-grown wheat*and the quota for Dominion wheat.   The latter was almost inseparable from the Ottawa Conference.    Itwas pointed out, however, that there was a distinc-tion between the quota in the two cases,  insomuchas the quota for Dominion wheat would be purchasedat the world price whereas in the case of the homequota a fixed price was involved.    The quota onDominion wheat, however, would only be given as1 partof a bargain favourable to the general trade andindustry of this country.    On the other hand it was urged that if the Dominion quota were acceptedit would greatly strengthen the demand for a quotaon home-grown wheat.The arguments against the scheme were not basedon its practicability, although several possibledifficulties were referred to, and it was repre-sented that the Cabinet ought to know the finalattitude of the millers as a whole.   On the farmingside of the question it was urged that farming oughtto adapt itself to the world economic conditions ,This was. actually in progress at the present time,particularly in parts of the country where cerealsare not the staple crop.   Adoption of the quota system would give a setback to this movement.
The question, it was claimed, was related to thesubject of rents.   Were the Government to give a quota on land where rent is paid, it was asketL, wtruld-&quot; &apos; &apos;not this be merely a subsidy to the landowners?When times were badt poor people were apt to fallback on bread as their ma&quot;in source of subsistence,and it should be the first aim of the Government tokeep the pric^ of bread as low as possible.    If the quota was given on wheat there would be an equallystrong claim not only in the case of other agricul-tural produce, such as malting barley ^which was inalmost a parallel position to wheat), but also inevery form of produce and even of industry whereeconomic difficulties were being encountered.    Itwas represented as wrong to give a fictitiousassistance to cereals, which were already greatlyover-produced in the world.   Pair wages would beachieved more successfully by the adaptation ofagriculture to economic conditions, which was inprogress, than by the wheat quota.   As regards theincrease in the price of the loaf it was pointed outthat the fact that it might be only a farthing wasnot the real issue.    It was the principle of Protec-tion that was involved.   The big issue at the next general Election was likely to be the taxation offood.    In the great industrial centres there wouldbe the strongest opposition to any policy whichraised the price of food.   The whole position ofthe present Government in defending the standard ofliving would be weakened if the principle of thewheat quota were adopted.   There was an essential difference between the policy of the wheat  quota,which would affect only,4 per cent, of agriculture,and the policy of the coal quota, which had been
introduced to improve the coal trade over 100 per cent of the area concerned,   ^he results of the coal quotato date, however, had not been such as to popularisethe principle o^ the quota.    The same argument appliedto the sugar-beet subsidy, which did not provide avery convincing argument for subsidies.   broadly speaking, the main argument against the wheat quotawas political.A view was advanced that even though the wheat quota might be an admirable policy provided that theGovernment were unanimously in favour of it and weresupported by a majority in the house of Commons, itwould be better to defer the matter in present condi-tions.The Cabinet agreed  To resume the discussion the same afternoon at 4 p,m..

The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Rome Secretary (G .P.-88 (31))  drawing attentionto a Question to be asked the same afternoon as towhen the Government amendments required to bring theThird Schedule of the Representation of the People(No.2) Bill into conformity with the decision ofthe House of Commons on University representationwill appear on the Paper.. After reviewing theposition and after setting forth the consequentialamendments required in the event of the decision ofthe Government to accept the omission of Clause 4of the Bill, the Home Secretary summed up thebalance of advantage as lying in the direction of accepting the decision of the House of Commons.   he asked, however,  that the Cabinet should considerthe question and advise him as to the policy which heshould announce on behalf of the Government .&apos;The Cabinet agreed  To accept the decision of the Houseof Commons and to approve the amend-ments proposed by the Home Secretary.
conclusion ion 7 .)members  of the Legislative Council of northern rhodesia in favour of the amalgamation of the wholeof the two territories under a Constitution similarto that enjoyed by Southern Rhodesia, and moreparticularly with the proposal of the SouthernRhodesia Government that a Conference should be held to discuss this possibility.    In the Memorandum itwas pointed out that it would be a mistake to calla Conference unless His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom were in sympathy with its objects .After a detailed examination of all aspects  ofthe question the two Secretaries of State reportedthat they had come to the conclusion that if therewas to be any addition o^ Northern territory to southern Rhodesia in the near future the most that could be added would be the Livingstone area, thatis to say,  an agricultural area in the most southerlypart of Northern Rhodesia, and that if any conference was held it should be strictly limited to the &apos;consideration of that issue.    They considered thatit should be made plain., in offering to participate in a Conference on this basis (i) that the time has not yet come when it is possible to determine the future political  orientation of that part of africa which may be generally described as lyingbetween the Zambesi and Tanganyika territoryy but(ii)  that  it is impossible for His Majesty&apos;&apos;sGovernment to consider, in present clrcumstances,ggUTHERN AND 10 . The Cabinet had before them a Joint---Memorandumji0rthf.RNRHODESIA. by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs andft the Secretary of State for the Colonies &apos;C,P.-84 (31).&apos;.(previous reference: dealing fully with the proposal of the government cabinet 72(3C),  Con- of Southern Rhodesia and of some of the elected

PALESTINE. 11.The Cabinet again had before them the memorandum the Position       by the Secretary of State for the Colonies (0.P.-67of the Attorney-General, (31)) on the subject of the Attorney-General ofPalestine .(previous reference; The Secretary of State for the Colonies reportedCabinet SI(31),  Con-        that except for the fact that Easter had passedelusion 5.)without disturbance the situation in Palestine showed the GENERALSITUATION. no signs of improvement.   He reported that in severalareas,  of which he gave details,  the Zionists hadA. I bought property and were undertaking eviction proceed-XtKilJ 7Ings against Arab families.   The High Commissionerviewed these evictions with anxiety and had revertedto a previous proposal to deal with the matter bymeans of land legislation.    The Secretary of Statehimself felt that unless the Jews would themselvesstop the process of evictions it would be necessaryto authorise the High Commissioner to issue anOrdinance for that purpose.    He had accordingly.askedDr. Weizmann to see him on the following day, and he proposed to put pressure on the Zionist leader totake steps to suspend the evictions.As the Prime Minister was expecting to meetDr. Weizmann at a social engagement the same day he undertook, at the express request of the Cabinet,to avail himself of any opportunity that might offer to have a friendly word with him on the subject and,if he thought fit, to warn Dr.. Weizmann as to thenecessity of stopping the evictions.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To postpone further consideration ofthe question of the evictions untilthe Meeting to be held the same afternoon:(b) To keep the question of the Attorney-General on the Agenda. &apos; :^ &amp;&amp;:0i &apos;^M

Tbe Cabinet bad befor-e them--the &quot;foil-owingdocuments relating to the Report of the RegionalTown Planning Committee:-A Memorandum by the Minister ofHealth (CP.-83 (31)) circulating a Report on Regional Town Planningschemes submitted by Lord Che1msfordon behalf of the Committee whichrecently met under his Chairmanship.The broad effect of this Report wasthat there is no great volume of fresh work immediately available from regional town planning schemes and that if such work as can befound is put in hand it is not aquestion of new authorities beingneeded to be set up for the purpose,but of further Exchequer financialassistance to the Local authorities who have undertaken as much work asthey think they can undertake havingregard to the many competing callson the rate funds.   The Minister ofHealth,  after consultation with theLord Privy Seal, the Secretary ofState for Scotland and the Ministerof Transport, proposed to publish the Report,  adding a footnote asto the position of the MiddlesexSewage Scheme,  on which progress has been made:A Memorandum by the Minister ofTransport on the subject of &quot;^eakBridges and the steps being taken with the aid of the Road Fund toreplace them (C.P.-91 (31)).The Cabinet agreed  (a) To postpone the question of thepublication of the Report on regional Town-Planning Schemes:(b) That the Lord Privy Seal (who had arranged conversations with repre-sentatives of the Liberals) should do his utmost to stave off thenecessity of any reference to theReport in his speech on the Vote of censure on Unemployment on thefollowing day .

As public reference had. already been madeto the Report of the Hommittee on Railway Fleotrifi-cation,  discussed at ^&quot;he Meeting of the cabinet referred to in the margin, and as reference to thematter would be desirable in the Debate on the vote of Censure on Unemployment, the Cabinet agreed  That the Report of Lord Weir&apos;s Com-mittee on Railway Electrificationshould be published.
