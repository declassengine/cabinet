government business.(previous reference:^Cabinet 11&apos; (51), Con-elusion 20.)2.    The Prime Minister read to the Cabinet aMemorandum he had received from the parliamentary secretary to the Treasury on the subject of Govern-rrent Business in Parliament, to which was attached a detailed programme allocating the time of the Houseof Commons up to Easter.    After making allowance forall unavoidable business, such as financial business,contingencies, and 8 days for the Representation ofthe People Bill, he said that it would only bepossible to provide time for some of the stages ofthe following essential Bills before Easter:-The fining IndustryWelfare Fund) Bill.-(Previous Reference:Cabinet 11 (31),Conclusion 13-),mhe agricultural marketing Rill.(Previous Reference:Cabinet 8 (31),  ft.Cone lu si on 2,)   ^O)1The Road ^TrafficBill.(Previous Reference:Oabinet/o^ (30),Conclus ion      )THF MINING INDUSTRY (WELFARE FUND)BILL.THE AGRICULTURAL MARKETING BILLfMONEY RESOLUTION).THE Rtoffi/TRAFFIC BILL.CINEMAS..Sunday Per-f ormances..(previous reference:Cabinet 10(31),  Con-clusion 8.)The above programme depended on the decision tobe taken by the Cabinet the same day as to Transi-tional Benefit, which would expire on March 31stunless renewed...The Home Secretary warned his colleagues thatthe recent decision of the Courts on the question of sunday entertainments  (cinemas) might force a newquestion before Parliament .After a short discussion the Prime Ministerappealed to his colleagues to refrain to the utmostfrom adding business to the Parliamentary programme.
3.    The Cabinet had before them the following documents on the subject of Unemployment Insurance:-A Letter addressed to the PrimeMinister by the Chairman of theRoyal Commission on UnemploymentInsurance, copies of which were handed round at the Meeting, inregard to the presentation of interim Reports and the consid-eration by the Royal Commissionof the question of transitional benefit (Appendix):A Note by the Minister of Labour(CP. 37 (31)) covering the draftUnemployment Insurance (No.2)Bill to increase the borrowing powers of the Unemployment Insur-ance Fund by  20,000,000.The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that hehad reason to believe that some of the members ofthe Royal Commission were unwilling to make any recommendation before they had heard the whole ofthe evidence.      This would include essential evidence from the T.U.C ,  the employers, the Local Authorities,as well as from Mr. H.D. Cole on experience in foreigncountries.      He had received informal information which pointed to the possibility that the RoyalCommission might not report before June or even July.The Cabinet recognised that so long a delay woumake ,it very difficult for the Government, who wouldhave carefully to consider the Report of the RoyalCommission, to pass legislation before the Recess.Such legislation, however, was essential if, as was unanimously agreed, Parliament could not be askedto extend the date from which transitional benefitbegins to expire for a longer period than six months;that is  to say,  from April 17th to October IJth.      Inview of the necessity cf passing legislation beforethe recess, which shall come into effect on theexpiration of the extended transitional period on
October-feene&amp;kfr- on- Se^t-erab-er 17th, it was felt to be essen-tial, without- hustLingthe Royal Commission, to call the Chairman&apos;s attention to the critical importanceof expediting the Report as much as possible.The Cabinet reoognised the importance, from apolitical point of view,  of forestalling criticism byannouncing the general lines of their policy beforethe introduction of the Unemployment Insurance(No .2)  Bill.After discussing the whole question, mainly inits political aspects, the Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Unemployment  Insurance(No.2) Bill should provide not only for increasing the borrowing powersof the Unemployment Insurance Fundby  26,0-00,000, but also for anextension of transitional benefit-by s ix months trv / - tiukhxlj (nx^ -. (b) That the finance of the transitionali^Itfu^r       benefit up t o^S^-fe-emfcrer 17th shouldbe dealt with in the Budget in theordinary way, but that the amountof the provision to be made after that date should be arranged betweenthe Minister of Labour and theChancellor of the Exchequer andtheir Officials, and,  further,  thatthe Chancellor of the exchequer should consider the procedure tobe followed,  e .g .,  SupplementaryFstimate, a new Finance Bill onthat point alone,, or by providing a surplus, etc.:(c) that, in order to ensure as far aspossible that the Report of theRoyal Commission might be availablein time for the Government to preparelegislation for dealing with unemploy-ment insurance and/or transitional benefit on a more permanent basis and to pass it through parliament before the Recess,  the Prime minister should, in his reply to the letter ofthe Chairman of the Royal Commission,ask that an Interim Report containingrecommendations on transitional benefitmight be available   not later than themiddle of May:(d) That the Cabinet, while not bound inadvance by the Report of the RoyalCommission, would naturally take it into most serious consideration in preparing their legislation:
(e) That the.Minister of Labour &apos;shouldbe authorised at once to inform theLeaders of the Liberal Party as tothe policy of the Government inregard to the Unemployment Insurance(No.2) Bill:(f) That, in order that the policy ofthe Government as to transitional benefit mieht be known before theintroduction of the Unemployment.Insurance (No ,2) Bill, the Chancellorof the Exchequer,  in his speech on     9the Economy Debate the same afternoonshould be authorised to make a state-ment of the intentions of the Govern-ment on the subject.s    See the following Conclusion.-5-
4.    The Cabinet authorised the Chancellor of theExchequer, besides making the statement referred toin the preceding Conclusion on the subject ofUnemployment Insurance and Transitional Benefitduring the Debate in Parliament on Economy the same afternoon, to make statements to the following(a) That,  in view of the 72 Committeesalready appointed by the government since they came into office, theywould not oppose the proposal of theliberal Party for a further inquiry into Fconomy in Government Departments:(b) That the financial situation might-involve sacrifices in which everyonewould have to bear a share,  and thatthe Cabinet themselves were prepared,to do so.It was further agreed  That the Prime Minister should intimatethe Government&apos;s acceptance of theLiberal Resolution, while objectingto the opening and closing phrases.
5.     The Cabinet had before them the following documents in regard to a proposal that theresponsibility for the control of British relationwith Palestine should be transferred from theColonial Office to the Foreign Office:-A Report by a Sub-Committee of theCommittee of Imperial Defence(C0P.-252 (30)), which had been before the Cabinet at the meeting referred +o in the margin:A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState ^or the Colonies  &apos;C.P,-27 (31))quoting the arguments in oppositionto such a transfer as set forth inparagraph 5 of Part II of theReport of the Sub-Committee of theCommittee of Imperial Defence,.andcountering each of the argumentsurged in the Report in favour ofthe proposal .   At the end of his memorandum the Secretary of Stateexpressed the vie^ that most ofthe difficulties of administeringPalestine and Trans Jordan are inherent and will persist no matter what Minister or what Department-bears the responsibility:.A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs  (C.P.-28(31)) setting forth the ForeignOffice objections to the proposed transfer.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That, in view of the objections urged by the Secretary of State forForeign affairs and the Secretary ofState for the Colonies,  the proposed transfer of the responsibility forthe control of British relations in Palestine from the Colonial Officeto the Foreign Office was inexpedientand should not be approved;(b) That &quot;chis decision should in no wayafxect the earlier decision of theCabinet to set up two Standing Co-ordinationCommittees of the Committee of ImperialDefence, one ministerial and the otherofficial,  to deal with such middle east questions as concern two or moreGovernment Departments;  (Cabinet 44- (j50)*Conclus ion J),
elusion 7(e) .)appointed by the Cabinet on November 6,  1930, with aview to the discussion of certain questions withrepresentatives of the Jewish Agency, had been reserved until the present Meeting of the Cabinet.From a later Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs  (C.P.-40 (31)) it now appeared that as a result of further conversationsthe representatives of the Jewish Agency had agreedto withdraw their request for an extension of theterms of reference to the Cabinet Committee, andthe Secretary of State suggested that the proposalsof His Majesty&apos;s Government regarding the development commission should be discussed by an Inter-Depart-mental Committee with the Jewish Agency,  it being understood that these proposals would also bediscussed simultaneously by the Figh Commissionerwith the Arabs in Palestine.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That there should be no extension to the Terms of Reference to theCabinet Committee on Palestine;(b) To approve the suggestion of theSecretary of State for ForeignAfxairs that the proposal of HisMajesty&apos;s Government regarding theDevelopment Commission should bediscussed by the interdepartmental committee with the Jewish agency,it being understood that theseproposals would also be discussedsimultaneously with the Arabs bythe High Commissioner in Palestine;(c) That the Inter-DepartmentalCommittee should for the presentinclude the Lord Advocate andMr. Malcolm MacDonald, M.P.;PALESTINE. 6.  The Cabinet had before them a Note by thePolicy in. Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (C.P.-25 (31))- - which had been considered at the Meeting referred to(Previoush Reference: in the margin, when the question of extending theCabinet 11(31). Con- Terms of Reference to the Committee on Palestine
(d) That the letter to Dr. Weizmannapproved by the Cabinet at the meeting mentioned in the margin should not bepublished before Friday next,February 1Jth,  in order to avoid itsbecoming the subject of agitation onthat day in the Mahommedan mosquesin Palestine;(e) That it was undesirable that theletter should be published in theform of a White Paper, as contem-plated at the last meeting of theCabinet, if this course could be avoided, owing to the bad impressionwhich publicity in so prominenta form was likely to make onArab opinion in Palestine;(f) That in replying to a Question inParliament the same afternoon thePrime Minister should explain thata Committee of the Cabinet has beenexchanging views with the Zionistleaders with regard to the interpre-tation of certain passages in thestatement of policy presented toParliament in October last;    thatit is proposed to embody the explanations which have been givenin the form of a letter to Dr.Weizmann, which will be communicatedto the press.      If strongly urged topresent the paper to Parliament thePrime Minister should intimate thathe would circulate a copy with the votes.      Only in the last resort shouldhe agree to publication as a white paper
7.      In addition to the Memorandum by the Secretaryof State for the Colonies &apos;S.P.-7 (31)), on thesubject- of Tin Restrictions, -which had been beforethem at the Meeting referred to in the margin, whenit was decided that the subject should stand over until an agreed scheme was before them, the cabinet had under consideration a further Memorandum by theSecretary of State (CPv-34 (31)) ,&apos; in which he stated that the two main objections of the federated malay States to the proposed scheme had now been removed by the substitution of March 1st as thedate of operation and by agreement that the schemeshall restrict production as well as export.   TheSecretary of State understood that these amendmentshad been accepted by Nigeria and the Dutch andBolivian Governments., and he now asked the authorityof the Cabinet to announce publicly that BisMajesty&apos;s Government approve in principle theinternational scheme of compulsory tin restrictionoutlined in CP.-7 (31), subj;eet to his being satisfied as to the details after negotiations withrepresentatives of the Netherlands and BolivianGovernments, and on the definite understanding thatthe soheroe is controlled by representatives of thefour Governments concerned.Some doubts were expressed at the cabinet as to whether, if the proposed restrictions were imposed on the production of tin,  it wouldbe possible to resist demands for corresponding
action in connection with other raw materialsat present over-produced in the Colonies, suchas rubber and sugar.The Cabinet were also informed thatnews had reached the Dominions Office of proposals by the Canadian Government, in connectionwith another metal,  bearing on the question.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the question of tinrestriction should be considered in its wider aspects by a committee composed as follows:-The Secretary of State for theColonies,The Secretary of State for theDominions ,The President of the Board ofTrade;(b) That the Committee should reportwithin the next few days..

THE TOWN and country PLAN-NING BILL.(previous reference:Cabinet 53(30), Con-elusion i,)9.   The Cabinet had before them the following documents in connection with the Town and country planning Bill:-A Memorandum by the Minister ofHealth, covering a draft Bill(H.A.-3 (31)):A Note by the Financial Secretaryto the Treasury (H.A..-4 (31)):A Memorandum bysioner of works the First Commis-(H.A.-6 (31)):A Memorandum! by the Minister ofHealth, covering a revised draftBill (H.Ao-7 (31)), which was a&quot;consolidating&quot; Bill and included,with some minorformer draft,amendments, thethesections of the town planning Act^ 1925, and of theLocal Government Act, 1929, andan application and consolidatingclause for Scotland:together with the Conclusions of the Committee ofHome Affairs thereon (H.A.C. 4th Cons.

The Cabinet approved, the proposalsof the Committee of Home Affairs,subject to further consultation between the Minister of Health,the Secretary of State for War,the Secretary of State for Air andthe First Lord- of the Admiralty, on certain details affecting theproperty of the Service Departments.The Prime Minister warned his colleagues thatit was doubtful if it would be possible to findparliamentary time for the passage of this bill and that,  if it was introduced,  the Liberalswere likely to attack it on the ground that itwas too limited in scope.      It was pointed outthat the Liberals were under a misapprehensionon this latter point.
inTEE LIQUORTRAEPTO PRO-E IB I&quot;1 IONBILL.(previous reference:Cabinet 11(31), Con-clusion 16.)10.     The Cabinet had before them the Liquor TrafficProhibition Bill,  introduced in the House of commons by a Private Member, which is down for Second reading on Friday, February 13th.The Home Secretary informed his colleagues that he proposed to say as little as possible,if anything, in regard to the Bill, beyond perhapsmaking clear that no action could be taken until after the Report of the Royal Commissionon the Liquor Traffic.

CINEMAS.inxndayperformancesSabbath Day-Observance.(previous reference:Cabinet 10(31), Con-clusion 0),fx12.    The Home Secretary informed hiscolleagues that the difficulties which had arisenout of a recent decision by the Courts inconnection with the Sunday opening of Cinemashad already achieved considerable proportions,and might involve legislation before longto legalise the position reached before the judgment was given.The Cabinet felt that any legislation on this subject was likely to raise the largerquestion of Sabbath Day observance,&apos; and suggested that the Home Secretary should ifpossible postpone action for a month or two.mm
RUSSIANDUMPING.Alleged forced labour in the timber Industry,(previous reference:Cabinet 7j5,(30), Con-clusion 9).15.    The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that a Question had been addressed to him in Parliament asking if hewas willing to appoint a small Committee toexamine into the conditions of labour in theRussian timber trade.     He himself was opposedto the appointment of any Committee.In the course of the discussion of thissubject it was pointed out that the appointmentof a Committee would open up    a very largequestion.      There was little doubt that an investigation would show that Russian timberwas importedwas handled by forced labour and/at prices withwhich the United Kingdom industry could notcompete;    the Committee would then be likelyto advise the extension of the Foreign Prison-made Goods Act of 1897.      In practice, however,it would be found impossible to confine theoperation of such an extension to Russia,and that other countries were affected in varying degrees.      The extension of the Act tothese countries would be found to conflict withour international obligations.A suggestion was made that it might bepossible to devise a series of questions tobe sent to the Russian Soviet Government, inorder to elicit whether the conditions underwhich the forced labour worked did not, perhaps,bring timber imports within the scope of theForeign Prison-made Goods Act, 1897.      It waspossible, for example,  that the conditions ofthe labour camps might be found to be such asto resemble a prison.
The questions should be so designed as toconfront the Soviet Government with the risks toAnglo-Russian trade that they were running inthe continuance of this labour.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs ahould not agree to the appointment of aCommittee;(b) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should again seethe Russian Soviet Ambassador;should draw his attention to thenew Questions in Parliament, andimpress upon him once more the seriousness of the situationwhich was growing up, for Anglo-Russian trade;(c) That the President of the Boardof Trade should consider whether any means could be found for bringing the question withinthe scope of the Foreign Prison-made Goods Act, 1897.
INDIA.(previous reference:Cabinet 6(31), Con-clusion 1),2, Whiteha 11 Gardens , S, W,1 a11th February,  1931 .The Cabinet agreed  That the Government delegates at the Indian Round table conference should meet at No.10, Downing Street, on Friday,February 13th, 1931, at10=30 a.m.
ion10 Is E C r S T. &apos;   &quot;&quot; APPENDIX.tCAB I N E T.UNE?I?LOYI ENT INSURANCE.Letter addressed to the Prime Minister by theChairman of the Royal Commission on Unemployment Insurance.ROYAL COMMISSION ON UNEMPLOYMENT n^SURANCB.9th February, 1951.Dear Prime Minister^In the letter which your Private Secretary wrote to me on 8th December notifying tne appointment of theRoyal Commission on Unemployment Insurance, he said thatyou hoped &quot;that the Royal Commission would, so far as was practicable, present interim reports and would acceleratetheir consideration of transitional benefit&quot;.     Inaccordance with your request, the Commission have given special consideration to the question of presenting an interim Report on the question of transitional benefit,in view of the fact that it begins to expire in Aprilneit, but they find considerable difficulty in isolatingit from the whole problem of the able-hoclied unemployed andthe determination of the proper spheres of the centralgovernment and the public assistance authorities.Moreover, the Commission have at present onlyheard evidence from official sources and they would not feel able to make any recommendations without hearingevidence from o ,her sources, particularly the representativesof employers and workers and of local authorities.Any interim report by the Commission at this stage would therefore have to be confined to a statement of facts
based on the official evidence which has been published9and in these circumstances I should be glad to beinformed whether you desire the Commission to presentsuch a report at once.     If so we will endeavour tomeet your wishes, but in the absence of a definiterequest from you the Commission would prefer to deferany report until they have heard further evidence andare in a position to make recommendations.Yours very truly5(Sgd.)
