mtrg LONDON 2. The-Cabinet had before them a Memorandum byPASSENGERTRANSPORT the Minister of Transport  (H.A.-8 &apos; 31)) covering aPILL.draft of the London Passenger Transport Bill.(Previous The Cabinet were informed that the Committee ofReference:Cabinet 13 Home Affairs had had a preliminary discussion on the(31).  Con-clusion 2.) subject  on March 2nd (H.A.C. 5th Conclusions  C31)) .f-R. As the Chancellor of the Exchequer had not had timeI7(3,&apos;)c)- to   examine the Bill, further consideration of thesubject had been postponed by the Committee of HomeAffairs until Monday, March 9th.The Prime Minister demurred to the very short time that had been given to the Cabinet to consider this Bill, having regard to its magnitude.   As theCommittee of Home Affairs had not yet completed itsexamination of the Bill he did not ask the Cabinetto consider it at the present Meeting.    He drew attention to a passage in the Memorandum statingthat it was desirable,  if possible, to introduce the Bill at once so that- its Second. Reading might-be obtained sufficiently long before Easter toenable the negotiations for setting up a JointCommittee of the two Houses to be completed by thetime the House adjourned.    It was,  of course,  outof the question for the Cabinet to give that decisionbefore the Bill had been agreed with the treasury and. other Departments and passed by the Committeeof Home Affairs.The Minister of Transport pointed out thattechnically the Bill was circulated to the cabinet with     the minimum notice required by the TreasuryCircular .Consideration of the moment- for the introductionof this Bill led to a discussion on the Parliamentary
time-table, the Conclusions of which are stated inthe following Minute.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Minister of Transport should agree the London Passenger transport bill with the Treasury at the earliest-possible moment:(b) That the Committee of Home affairs should give very careful considers-tion to the Bill:(c) that the Minister of Transport shouldcontinue his negotiations with thevarious interests concerned..-Z-

3. In the course of the discussion recorded in the preceding Minute the Prime Minister informed his colleagues that arrangements had been made for the Service Estimates to be taken in the following week, namely:-

Tuesday, March 10th: The Army Estimates.

Wednesday, .. 11th: The Navy Estimates.

Thursday ... 12th: The Air Force Estimates.

The Cabinet were informed that the discussion of the Navy Estimates would probably involve, either next week or at some later date, a Debate on the Franco-Italian Naval Agreement just concluded, particulars of which would have to be announced during the Debate by the First Lord of the Admiralty.

There was general agreement that it was important to proceed with some of the Government&apos;s measures of Social Reform.

The Cabinet were informed that the Town and County Planning Bill had been communicated to the Leaders of the Liberal Party, who had not yet replied:  but that otherwise the Bill was ready: that the Consumers&apos; Council Bill was practically ready: and that the Bill dealing with the opening of Cinemas on Sundays would be brought before the Committee of Home Affairs next week.

The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that he proposed to ?ut down the Improvement of Livestock (Licensing of Bulls) Bill and Small Landholders and Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Bill as alternatives for Friday, March 13th.

The Cabinet agreed --

That the Ministers concerned should be ready to proceed at an early date with the following Bills:-

 
The Small Land-holders andAgr iculturalFoldings(Scot land)Bill.&apos; (previous reference:Cabinet 62(50) , C on-clusion 13.)The Town and Country planning bill. \\The Consumers Council Bill.The Bill to regulate the Sundsopening of Cinemas .
ELECTORALREPORT.Representa-tion of thePeople Bill,(previous reference:Cabinet 15(31), Con-clusion 10)f.K.7(&quot;)104. The Home Secretary reported that important decisions might have to be taken during the Debate-on the Committee Stage of the Representation of thsPeople Bill;    for example, the desirability mighthave to be considered of leaving some questions to a free vote of the House.   He would like to kno-whether the Cabinet would leave these matters tothe Chief Whip and himself, or whether some of hiscolleagues would be deputed to confer with him onthese matters .The Cabinet agreed  That the Home Secretary should consult the Prime Minister onany point of difficulty whichmight arise during the Debate;for example, any question onwhich he might deem a free voteto be desirable.
5. The Cabinet had before them a Report circulatedby the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs andthe First Lord of the Admiralty (CP.-64 (31)) ontheir visit to Paris and Rome in connection with the outstanding questions of the London Naval Conference.The Prime Minister,  on behalf of the Cabinet,congratulated all those who had taken part on thesuccess of their Mission.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs emphasised the political importance of the agreement reached.    The Experts had carried the matter to thefurthest point which was possible for them, but nevertheless, on the evening of Sunday,  February 22nd,the negotiations had arrived at a critical stage andthere was a real danger of a new competition in naval armaments between France and Italy.   Nothing short ofa personal visit, such as that carried out by theFirst Lord o^ the Admiralty and himself,  could have brought about an agreement.    Now relations between france and Italy were better than they had been for years.   The French Foreign Minister had undertaken to take advantage of this favourable atmosphere to try and settle the outstanding political questionswith Italy, such as those arising in Tunis and Libya.If he was successful in this,  the two countries wouldsign a Treaty of Arbitration and Friendship.   Theagreement was also very important in its bearing onthe forthcoming Disarmament Conference.The First Lord of the Admiralty made a full state-ment to the Cabinet on the technical results achieved.
The Cabinet agreed  That the First Lord of the admiralty should make a statement in parliament on the subject of the conversations in the Debate on the Navy Estimateson Wednesday next, March Ilth, andthat the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should announce this in reply to Questions in Parliament .
6. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet thathe had comrminioated with Mr Baldwin and Mr LloydGeorge as to the participation of the opposition parties in the work of preparation for the DisarmamentConference.   Mr Lloyd George had consented to render assistance in any and every way possible.   Mr Baldwin.,before replying, had discussed the matter verballywith him and had explained that, while anxious,personally, to assist in every way, his colleagues would probably demur to any association with aCabinet Committee,The Prime Minister suggested that while theGovernment might retain their Cabinet Committee, fortheir own discussions, they might remit the jointexplorations to a Committee of the Committee ofImperial Defence.    As Chairman of the Committee ofImperial Defence he was entitled by its constitution to nominate any persons he might deem desirable toform a Committee.    He had ascertained that therewere numerous precedents for the association ofmembers of the Opposition Parties in the work of theCommittee of Imperial Defence:    including, forexample, at different times, the late Lord Balfourand the late Lord Haldane .   He would propose thattechnical experts should be nominated as Associate-Members, to be available to advise the Committee when required.    These would, of course, be nominated bythe Government.The Cabinet were informed that the dominions were prepared to co-operate in this work of prepara-tion.
After disgussing the proposal in its practical and political aspects, the Cabinet agreed  That the Prime Minister should beauthor is ed to write to Mr Baldwininforming him that the Cabinet had decided that a Committee of theCommittee of Imperial Defence shouldbe set up to consider the positionof the United Kingdom at the forth-coming Disarmament Conference atGeneva, adding that he would beglad to nominate two or threerepresentatives of the conservative party whose names might be sent tohim by Mr Baldwin.   He should explain that the hope of the Government wasthat the Delegation of the UnitedKingdom at Geneva would be repre-sentativc of the various political parties, in a manner corresponding to the Committee of the Committeeof Imperial Defence.-10-
E ECONOMICMSEQ,UENCFSDISARMAMENTfir eviousBef erence:ffabinet 46150), Con-conclusion   10.)7.       The Cabinet had before them a Second Reportof the Committee on the Economic Consequences of disarmament (CP.-61 (31)), re-examining, at therequest of a Deputation from the Joint disarmament committee of the T.U.C.,  the question of grants for distressed armament areas .    A Note was appended to the Report by the Ministers of Health and Labourand the Secretary of State for Scotland, affirmingthat the administrative objections to the proposalare well-nigh insuperable and that strong reasonsexist for the view that no further general assistancein relief of rates at the present time can bejustified,.    A draft reply to this effect was attachedto the Report, and the recommendation to the Cabinet-was aa follows:-&quot;To approve the despatch to the JointDisarmament Committee of a reply onthe question of grants to areasdistressed as a result of disarms-ment policy,  in the form of thedraft contained in Appendix 2 tothis Report  (CP .-61 (31)),  on theunderstanding that the assent ofthe First Lord of the Admiralty tothis recommendation will be obtained on his return to England.&quot;The Cabinet approved the above recommendation and agreed:-That the despatch of the letter to theJoint Disarmament Committee of the T.U.C.should be preceded by a personal interviewat which the intention to send a letter should be notified and its substance explain-ed.

The Report of the majority ofthe Committee, consisting of the Chairman, the lord privy Seal, the Minister of Agriculture and Pisher-ies,. the President of the Board of Trade and theSecretary of State for Scotland (subject to aqualification regarding an equivalent benefit forScotland)1,, recommended to the Cabinet -&quot;To approve the Home Wheat QuotaScheme as set out in the appendix to CP.-52 (31) and to authorisethe Minister of Agriculture andFisheries to arrange for thepreparation of a draft Bill togive legislative effect to thescheme&quot;&quot;,The First Lord of the Admiralty and theFinancial Secretary to the Treasury, however,considered that the advantages claimed for thescheme were not sufficient to outweigh its objec-tions.-   They also dissented from the scheme on general political grounds and were unable to resist the conclusion that acceptance of thescheme would involve the abandonment of the mainease against food taxes and. of the key positionof Free Trade.The Prime Minister said that he hadreceived a note from the Chancellor of theExchequer who was Opposed to the majorityr e c omm endatlon.
The Cabinet were reminded of the close connection between the question of a Wheat Quota andthe preparations for the Ottawa Conference.      Theywere informed that considerable progress had beenmade with other aspects of the preparations forthis Conference and the President of the Board ofTrade announced bin i^tnnti^n nf ej n^nl a fca aag amemorandum on the subject^i-n- ther-focme^a to-^-f uturo.The Prime Minister undertook to ascertain,as soon as possible, from the Chancellor of theExchequer, who was at present indisposed, how soon itwould be possible for him to attend a meeting of theCabinet.The Cabinet agreed:-That as soon as the Chancellor of theExchequer is available a special meetingof the Cabinet should be held toconsider the following questions -The Wheat Quota,The Ottawa Conference.
9.       The Cabinet had before them a Most SecretMemorandttm by the President of the Board of Trade(CP.-55 (31)) covering a Confidential Report byMr C Bruce Gardner, Managing Director of SecuritiesManagement Trust, on the Structure of the Iron andSteel Industry of Great Britain,  containing plans for rationalisation.    The Report had been preparedafter presentation, in confidence,  of the GovernmentsSteel Report to certain representatives of theindustry and of the City of london, and was therefore a complement to the Government Report.    The Presidentof the Board of Trade stated that it was important that no public reference should be made to Mr BruceGardner&apos;s Report, which had been communicated onthat understan&amp;Ing..The Cabinet were impressed with the evidencecontained in Mr. Bruce Gardner&apos;s Report and confirmed by the latest Report on the Trade of the Countrycirculated by the President of the Board of Trade(CP. 53 (31) of the very critical state of theIron and Steel Industry.The President of the Board of Trade consider-ed that further delay in the reorganisation of theindustry was dangerous and invited the views ofthe Cabinet as to whether he should suggest to Mr.Bruce Gardner to impose a time limit on his further negotiations on the present lines.    He said thatthere was bound to be strong opposition in variousquarters and in each of the districts whereamalgamations were proposed. In fact,
the opposition of a minority would be calculated towreck the proposed amalgamations unless the Governmentintervened to compel the minority to co-operate.He further raised the question of whether heshould intimate to Mr. Bruce Gardner that in the absenceof voluntary co-operation the Government would be pre-pared to impose it by legislation.Ir/the course of the discussion it was pointed outthat even if Mr. Bruce Gardner&apos;s proposals were adoptedeither voluntarily or compulsorily and put in operation the British Steel Industry would not be able to reduceits prices to the level of foreign competitors.    In other words, the proposed amalgamations would not avoid the strong demand of the Iron and Steel Industry for some form of protection against foreign competition;, which now resulted in the importation of nearly three million tons of foreign steel in 1930, as compared with an export of 3,250,000 tons.It was further pointed out that the Bruee Gardnerproposals must result in the closing down of some partsof the industry,  leaving considerable regions derelictand workless.The Cabinet discussed at some length the politicaland fiscal issues involved in the question and agreed:-(a) That the President of the Board of trade should see Mr. Bruce Gardner and presshim to say whether it was indispensablethat the whole of the Iron and Steelinterests must enter the proposedamalgamati ons.(b) That the President of the Board of trade should circulate a memorandum setting outthe possible alternatives to a tariff withthe object of enabling the Iron and SteelIndustry to hold its own against foreigncompetition.
