UNEMPLOYMENTINSURANO E.Finance of.(previous reference:Cabinet 11(31)    Con-clusion 3..)fx2.   At the outset of the Meeting the Ministerof Labour handed round a Memorandum (CP.-31 (31))containing proposals prepared as the outcome of discussions between the Prime Minister, theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister ofLabour for emergency financial measures to dealwith the finance of the Unemployment InsuranceScheme pending a Report by the Royal Commission.All copies of this Memorandum were collectedafter the Meeting and returned to the Minister ofLabour,  except one, which is kept in a sealedenvelope with the Secretary7s file of the Cabinet  ;Minutes.The Cabinet first considered the question ofwhat justification there was for emergency measures.They were reminded that the Royal Commission had only begun its investigation on December 19, 1930.When it was appointed it had been understood thatthe question of Unemployment Insurance should remainin statu quo until the first Report was received.Why,  it was asked, was it necessary to depart from/this policy?It was explained that the necessity aroseout of the need to pass new legislation to increase,once more, the borrowing powers of the UnemploymentInsurance Fund.   When It was decided to appoint the Royal Commission it had been anticipated thatthe  10,000,000 increase in the borrowing powerssanctioned by Parliament would, last until the endof March.    It was now estimated that the funds would be exhausted by the end of February, andthis rendered it essential to introduce a Bill toobtain new borrowing powers within the next week or
two.    The normal difficulty in obtaining freshborrowing powers earlier than had been anticipatedwas increased by the emphasis that had been laid inthe published Official evidence before the RoyalCommission on the very grave effect on the national finances of the continued borrowing.    In thesecircumstances it was thought that Parliament wouldnot be willing to grant powers to increase the Fundunless accompanied by some measures towards the rehabilitation of the Fund.Until recently it had been contemplated that,if this emergency should arise, it would be possibleto base the proposals of the Government on a reeom-mendation by the Royal Cc-mmission which,  it had been thought, might be able to present an Interim Reportby the end of January (Cabinet 9 (31), Conclusion 6).Up to nof, however, the Royal Commission had onlyheard the evidence of Government Officials, and nonefrom other quarters.    Any Report it could presentwould only provide a summary of the Official evidence.,and it was known to be unlikely that at this stageany commentary or constructive proposals would beincluded.,    In these circumstances it had been feltnecessary to ask the Cabinet to consider emergencyproposals without waiting for a Report from theRoyal Commission.The Cabinet were asked to bear in mind that ifthe proposals now under consideration were adoptedwithout corresponding financial sacrifices elsewhere.&apos;the burden would fall exclusively upon the unemployed,that is to say, the poorest element in the popula-tion.    It was suggested that this was hardly con-sis tent with the spirit  of the general policy ofthe Government, so frequently announced, of &quot;work or
maintenance&quot;.    In this connection attention &quot;was drawn to the following Resolution of which notions had beengiven by some of the supporters of the Government,&quot;That this Eousc is of opinion thatany measure of economy which involves the reduction of the purchasing powerof working sections of the community or of those in receipt of unemploymentrelief is unjust and uneconomic with-out a corresponding measure so appliedas to adjust the real burden of theinternal, debt, and of all fixed charges on industry, to meet the appreciatedvalue of the monetary unit&quot;.The Cabinet were informed,, however, that,  owing tothe fall in the cost of living,  the purchasing powerof the rates of benefit now suggested would be worthmore than were the existing rates when first-Introduced .There was general agreement that there wouldbe serious Parliamentary criticism if the new legis-lation merely continued the policy of previous acts of Parliament without an adequate explanation of thepolicy of the Government towards the rehabilitation of the Insurance Fund&apos;    and, in addition, any announcement on the lines of the proposals beforethe Cabinet would have to be accompanied by someconvincing statement of the intention of theforGovernment to make proposals^spreading the burdenof the financial emergency arising from the insolvencyof the Unemployment Insurance Fund throughout all sections of the community.Some discussion took place as to the dilemmathat would arise in making such an announcement.On the one hand, it was- felt that the house ofCommons, before sanctioning any policy to reducethe benefits to the unemployed, would desire to bereassured as to the reality of the measures to be
ISOtaken to equalise the burden:    while,  on the etherhand, from the point of view of financial expediencyand of Parliamentary time,  it would hardly he possibleto anticipate the Budget.After prolonged consideration of the question in its financial and political aspects, the cabinet agreed -(a) That a Bill to inorease the borrowing powers of theUn emp1oyment Ins uranc e Pun dby  20,000,000, framed on thelines of previous Acts, shouldbe prepared and introduced bythe Minister of Labour:(b) That the proposals in CP.-31 (31)towards the rehabilitation of theUnemployment Insurance Fund couldnot be dealt with as an isolated. problem, and only as part of a comprehensive financial policy forspreading the burden of the existing financial difficulties throughoutall classes of the community:(c) That the Cabinet Committeeappointed at -the Meeting onJanuary 14th (Cabinet  6 (31),Conclusion 4)(viz i,:    The Chancellor of theExchequer,The President of the Boardof Trade,The First Lord of theAdmiralty,with the Lord Privy Seal,who had been co-opted,and with powers to co-optother Ministers )should continue its examination ofthe financial situation with a viewto the completion of its proposals.

During the discussion referred to in theprevious Minute,  the Minister of labour gave the Cabinet particulars of the present positionof the weavers&apos;  dispute.   At the present moment the outlook was not very favourable, except thatin certain quarters  proposals were under consid-eration for a new approach to the question onthe lines of a Wages Board, with an Independent-Chairman and a Joint Committee to consider new methods in the industry.
