4- u(in the absence of the Prime minister the Chancellor of the Exchequer took the Chair.)THE COAL 1. The President of the Board of Trade reportedSITUATION.that while the coal difficulties in South Wales(Previous were by ne means ended, the situation was decidedlyReference:Cabinet 4 better.   He and the Secretary for Mines had spent(31), C on-clusion 2.) the whole of the previous day in long negotiationswith the object of trying to find a basis on whichthe parties to the dispute could come together.The owners had maintained stubbornly their attitudetowards the National Industrial Eoard, and therewas no doubt that if the recommendation of that body had been pressed as the basis, the parties would have separated.   The miners&apos; representatives had recognised that it was no use fighting longeron that basis, and the difficulty had been to find some other.    The plan of first seeing each partyseparately, which he had outlined to the Cabineton the previoiis day, had been followed.    Eventuallya basis had been found on which the two parties had been able to meet,.    In the evening the repre-sentatives of the owners had met those of the miners and had adopted this basis as the starting-pointof a fresh meeting of the late Conciliation Board.They had arranged to meet at Cardiff on Friday,Q January 9th, and had drawn up a joint Press Oommuni^ie,The President o^ the Board of Trade then read thebasis, which is attached in the Appendix.
Commenting on this basis, the President ofthe Board of Trade pointed out that the owners had been successful in their desire to avoid therecommendation of the National Industrial Board.They had, however, made concessions on a number ofother points.    For example, in paragraph (3) theyhad been very anxious to introduce in the first sentence the words underlined below:-&quot;The wage applicable to the newhours and any matter having a bearing thereon to be dealt with at once by the Conciliation Board.&quot;The miners had strongly resisted this, and it wasonly late in the day that the owners had reluctant-ly agreed to delete it.   A point of considerable importance in the basis was the provision for there-establishment of the South Wales ConciliationBoard, which had come to an end in November.    Ifthe basis was confirmed, the appointment ofthe Independent Chairman would be made, failing agreement, by the Lord Chief Justice or by the speaker       the House of Commons c The owners had fought to make the wages settlement retrospectiveto January 1st, but this had been strongly resisted by the miners .   The point would probably besubmitted to the Independent Chairman, but thePresident thought that the owners now recognisedthat it would be impossible for the point to bedecided in their &quot;favour.If the former Conciliation Board were toagree on Friday, the representatives of the owners would at once be able to confirm the agreement.The representatives of the miners would require totheobtains/assent of the South Wales Miners&apos;&apos; Federationat a meeting which would be held on the following
23day.    If this assent were given, work would be resumed on Monday next,  January 12th.The President of the Board of Trade paid a tribute to the assistance he had received, during a very difficult day, from the Secretary for Mines.In reply to questions from his colleagues the President of the Board of Trade made clearthat the South Wales mine-owners had recognised the provisions of the Coal Mines Act other thanthose relating to the National Industrial Board,which were not compulsory.    The provisions of theAct relating to marketing schemes, district alloca-tion, and so forth, had already been put intooperation in South Wales .The Chancellor of the Exchequer,  on behalf ofthe Cabinet,  congratulated the President of theBoard of Trade on the success of his negotiations,which had exceeded the reasonable anticipations ofhis colleagues.
(JHE COTTONINDUSTRY.(previous reference:Cabinet 73(30)-, Con-clusion 11.)ft.C(u)ty.232. The Minister of Labour gave the Cabinetsome particulars of the present dispute in theCotton industry, affecting at present the WeaversUnion.    She indicated that in certain quartersthere was a tendency to suggest that the HomeSecretary and the President of the Board of Trade,who had lately been interesting themselves onbehalf of the Cabinet in the re-organisation of theCotton Industry, might be asked to intervene inthe dispute.   The Ministry of Labour felt, however,that the dispute should be kept on a purelyindustrial basis .   As the result of the activitiesof the Ministry a meeting was about to be held at manchester of the Northern Counties TextilesTrades Federation, from which useful results might follow.The Secretary of State for War, who formerlywas  connected with the textile industry, gave theCabinet some further particulars in regard to thedispute, and explained the highly technical mattersfrom which it originated.   He also described themachinery of the Northern Counties Textiles TradesFederation which came into operation in the eventof any of the Textiles Unions in Lancashire, eachof which is autonomous, becoming involved in a dispute.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That  it would be inadvisable forthe Ho- e Secretary and the Presidentof the Board of Trade to concern themselves with the dispute in theCotton Industry, since this might even be detrimental to the important matters of organisation in thecotton trade in which they areinteresting themselves on behalfof the Cabinet:
(b) That as the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs had already arranged to keep a political engagement at manchester and in his constituencyat Burnley, he should, before leavingLondon,  discuss the matter with theMinister of Labour and any appropriateOfficial., and in Lancashire shouldavail himself of any opportunity thatmight occur to render good offices and bring together the parties to thedispute.     In this connection it wassuggested that the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs might, in thefirst instance, get into communicationinformally with Mr Hindle, the Presidentof the Amalgamated Weavers.    If, as aresult of this conversation, he decidedthat the presence of the Secretary ofState for War might be useful inLancashire, he should not hesitate tocall upon him.Whitehall Gardens,  S,,W.l,January 8, 19 31.
