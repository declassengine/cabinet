26 S &quot;3, The Cabinet had. before them once more the interim Report o^ the Agricultural development committee (C.P.-52 (31))  on the subject of theHome Wheat Quota Scheme.In the course of the discussion some emphasiswas laid on the political inconvenience of postponinga decision on the question of the Vfheat Quota, moreparticularly in view of the time that had elapsed since the undertaking made by the Chancellor of theExchequer on August 1,  19 30, that &quot;As soon as the&quot;conclusions of the Imperial Conference are known&quot;the Government will undertake whatever practicable&quot;steps can be devised to put cereal growing in this&quot;country on an economic foundation&quot;,    On the otherhand there was general agreement that the questionought not to be decided in the absence of theChancellor of the Exchequer.    TS%^-^s?te^that it would be unwise to adopt the proposal inprinciple until general agreement had been reached as to the details and on the machinery for carryingit out.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the question o^ the Fome wheat-Quota should be considered as soonas the Chancellor of the exchequer is sufficiently recovered to take part- in the discussion:(b) That in the meanwhile the subject should be placed on the Agendafrom week to week, as it isdesirable that a decision shouldbe reached before Easter.

elusion 5.)about to become a, mother.    It was pointed out thatthe Bill would effect a humane and necessary refonrin procedure under the Criminal Law;    that  it wasnot controversial, since no-one could object to the reform which the Bill proposed to effect:    and thatit was evident, from the public interest in thecase referred to, that legislation on the lines ofthe Bill would command general support.   The HomeSecretary was being pressed by the Women1s Organ is a-tions to give facilities, and as in the absence ofsuch facilities there was little likelihood of itsmaking any progress he proposed that the Bill should now be taken over as a Government measure.    He had consulted the  Chief Whip, who saw no difficulty inthis course.The Cabinet were reminded by the Home secretary that the Private Member&apos;s Bill had been drafted inthe Home Office.    It was strongly supported and had actually passed Second Reading in the house ofCommons before it had been printed.mhe Prime Minister, while willing to adopt thecourse proposed by the Home Secretary,  if this was absolutely necessary, pointed out that to adopt thepresent Pill as a Government measure would create a somewhat embarrassing precedent,  as he was being pressed to give facilities for a number of otheruseful Bills that had been introduced by PrivateJLvplTAL &apos;7...
