F.K.The Prime Minister alluded to the general positionincluding Scotland,  and added that if possible he also would be in touch with the leaders of theMiners&apos; Federation..   mhe important point was thatas regards July the Government must not be presentedwith an ultimatum-    that is to say, any decision onthe subject must be freely and completely a matter for the Government. .The Cabinet agreed with this view. -THE GOAL 1.

The Cabinet had before them a Memor-a.-nd.-um bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and theFirst Lord of the Admiralty (Appendix),which hadbeen circulated early the same morning, on thesubject of the serious position which had arisen in connection with the Franco-Italian naval agreement negotiations.    It was recalled that theAgreement, set forth as the result of their visit to paris and Rome in a document headed &quot;Bases ofAgreement&quot; (appended to Cmd.3&amp;12), was to be put in proper form for signature by an international   Draft-ing Committee which had been meeting in London.Unfortunately at that Committee the French ExpertDelegates raised questions of interpretation, oneof which was of a most important character, and if no solution could be found for it there was almost complete certainty that there would be a breakdown.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs andthe First Lord of the Admiralty made statements inelaboration of the Memorandum.In the course of the discussion a suggestion wasmade that it might be advisable to invite M. Briandand Signor Grandi to come to London, but the PrimeMinister and the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs thought it unlikely that the latter was ina position to accept such an invitation.The Cabinet agreed  -&quot;That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should be author-is ed to communicate with M, Briandrecalling the efforts made by HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom to bring about an agreement;impressing on him the serious effectthat a breakdown at this stage wouldhave on the political situation&apos; notconce&amp;ling that the responsibilityfor the present situation is due tothe&quot; French attitude;    pointing out
that this was no longer a question for Experts;   and emphasising thatit is the considered view of HisMajcsty&apos;s Government that the Headsof Agreement, as understood by all who were concerned in the negotia-tions in Paris and Rome, should hethe sole basis of the work of the drafting Committee.

Interim Report of a Cabinet Committee on the home the Home wheat quota Scheme,   wheat Quota Scheme (C.P.-52 (31)).The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that, in(previous reference: company with some of his colleagues, he had visitedCabinet 19(31)    Con-      the Chancellor of the Exchequer at his home lastclusxon 10.)Sunday, and he was glad to be able to report a very-f.R- marked improvement in his health.   The Chancellor11 (yi)Q of the Exchequer hoped to b,e able to make his ownEudget Statement towards the end of April.The question of the Home Wheat Quota had beentouched upon, without    eliciting any change of view on the part of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.After a discussion, in the course of whichconsiderable emphasis was laid on the importance ofobtaining an early decision on this question, theCabinet agreed  (a) That the Prime Minister should write to the Chancellor of the Exchequerand let him know that from the pointof view of the Ottawa Conference,no less than of the agriculturalsituation,  it was the view of theCabinet that a decision ought to betaken on the subject of the HomeWheat Quota at the first Meetingafter the Recess, and should suggestthat if the Chancellor was unfortunatelystill unable to be present he might perhaps be willing to furnish theCabinet with a memorandum of his views:(b) That the subject should be placed onthe Agenda Paper of the first Meetingof the Cabinet after the Easter recess and should have first place afterForeign Affairs:(c) To take note of the suggestion of thePrime Minister that they should notoverlook the interdependence of the suggestions that had been made forquotas at home, from the Dominions,from the Argentine, and possibly fromRussia, and. that they should read thereports of the International AgriculturalConference at Rome.
rpTIB BUDGET .(previous-Reference:Cabinet 6(31), Oon-conclusion 4.)4.   During the discussion referred to in thepreceding Minute enquiry was made as to the date on which the Chancellor of the Exchequer expectedto introduce the Budget, and the Prime ministers aid that the present arrangement, agreed to withthe Chancellor., was that the Budget Statement shou..ldbe made on Monday, April 27th.The Cabinet were reminded that in normal yearsparticulars of the Budget were usually communicatedto the Cabinet at the last possible moment, twicewithin the last seven years only on the morning ofthe Budget Statement, and at other times frombetween one to six days.    It was felt, however,that this was by no means a normal year from thepoint of view of the Budget, and that the Chancellorof the Exchequer might wish, in view of the import-ance of the present position, to consult hiscolleagues at any rate on questions of political importance.The Prime Minister was asked to write to theChancellor of the Exchequer on the &quot;subject..-5-

6. The Prime Minister, as a matter of urgency,brought to the notice of the Cabinet the followingamendment to be moved on Second Reading of theArmy and Air Force Annual Bill on the followingevening:-&quot;The general conditions of the contract to be entered into shall include a stipulation that therecruit shall not be liable, norshall it be lawful in pursuanceof this Act to call upon suchrecruit, to take duty in aid ofthe civil power in connection witha trade dispute, or to perform, inconsequence of a trade dispute,any civil or industrial dutyt      customarily performed by a civilian in the course of his employer,Provided that, in the event ofBis Majesty declaring by proclama-tion,  in accordance with the provi-sions of the Emergency Powers Act,,1920, that a state of emergencyexists, this stipulation shall notaPPly so long as such state ofemergency exists&quot;.It was pointed out that if the above amendmentwere adopted, the military forces could only becalled upon to support the civil power after astate of emergency had been proclaimed.    It was quite conceivable, however, that a seriousemergency might arise quite suddenly.    For example,the Police might be over-powered and seriousdisturbance to public order might take place insome locality before an emergency could beproclaimed enabling the military forces to becalled in in aid of the civil power.On the other hand, there was general agreement that it ought to be impossible for troops to becalled out by partisan Magistrates to support one side in a dispute *.
The Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary of State for war should be authorised to explain thedifficulty to the Rouse of Commons&apos;to point out that the wording ofthe amendment would enable actualdanger to arise to public orderwithout the possibility of usingtroops in aid of the civil powerto restore order;    and to undertaketo try and find some method of meeting the difficulty which was not open to the objections of the amend-ment.-8-

VETERINARYSURGEONS.AgreementBetween theUnited Kingdomand the IrishFree State.(previous reference:Cabinet 52(27),.0on-clusion 1.)Efc.12. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs(C.P.-77  (31)) bringing to notice the questionof the enactment of legislation in this countryto give effect to the recently signed agreementbetween His Majesty&quot;s Government in the UnitedKingdom and His Majesty7s Government in the IrishFree State as to the registration and control ofVeterinary Surgeons.   This agreement followsgenerally the solution reached in the somewhat similar question of the supervision of the medical and dental professions in the Irish Free State,regulated by the Medical and Dentists Acts(Amendment) Act,  1927, which embodied and confirmed a similar agreement. -The agreement itself,  in its final form, was sodrawn that there was no reason why United kingdom legislation to confirm it was required.   TheIrish Free State Government, however, contestedthis view, and their Bill was drafted in such a form as to secure that the agreement could not come into effect until confirmed by UnitedKingdom legislation.    From the point of view ofpolicy the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairsdeemed it unwise to ask the Irish Free StateGovernment to amend their own Bill, having regardto the political difficulties to which such a coursewould inevitably expose them.    In the circumstances the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs askedfor the approval of the Cabinet to the eamlyintroduction in Parliament of a Bill to implement the agreement, and that he might be authorised toinform the Irish Free State Government at once that His. .Ma jesty &apos; s Government in the Unit edKingdom
propose to take this action.   The Bill would takethe form of a short one-clause Bill, was uncontro-versial, and would take up only a minimum of Parlia-mentary time.    In the event of Cabinet concurrence in these suggestions the Secretary of State proposedto notify the Leaders of the Opposition of theaction contemplated, and,  in so doing,  to draw their attention to the uncontentious nature of the suggested legislation.The Cabinet approved the proposalsof the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs, as set forth in CP.-77 (31)and summarised above, and agreed thatthe necessary Bill should be introduced in the Rouse of Lords.

In that event they were advised that itwould be contrary to precedent and, indeed,     .eon-stitutionally impossible, to instruct the Attorney-General as to the line which he should adopt.   the attorney-General would address to the Board sucharguments as he considered proper, having regardto his view of the law.The Cabinet took note of the Memo-randum by the Secretary of State *.for Dominion Affairs (CP ,,-80 (31)).

APPENDIX*    35[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government, and should bereturned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.]Memorandum,for circulation&apos; to the Cabinet,CONFIDENTIAL aWe desire to consult our colleagues as a matterof urgency on the serious position which has arisen in connexion with the Franco^Italian naval agreementnegotiations.     The Cabinet will remember-that as aresult of our visit to Paris and. Rome agreement wasreached which was set out in a document headed&quot;Bases of Agreement&quot; and which-was included in theWhite Paper Miscellaneous No- 10 (1931) submitted toParliament on March 1.1thIThis agreement was to be put in proper form for signature by a drafting committee which duly assembledin London for the purpose,.     At that Committee,unfortunately,, the French expert delegates raisedquestions of interpretations one of which was of a mostimportant characters and if no solution is to be found for it there is almost complete certainty that therewill be a breakdownoIn the agreement arrived at on March 1st france was allowed to retain 845555 tons of overage ships, but with the special reservation no precedent v/as beingcreated for the final solution of the question whether,and if so in what manner, tonnage remaining overageon the 31st December 1936 may ultimately be replaced.This left it open for France to claim at the 1935 con-ference if she desired, the ri^ht to replace overagetonnage in whole or in part, and for us to resist if we thought fit, and the First Lord in accepting this.stressed
stressed the point that if there were additionalbuilding gr anted to France in this way at the 1935conference we should also have to consider increasing our cruiser tonnage.     It was understood in paris and in Rome and indeed throughout the whole of theprevious negotiations that the agreement was drawn inaccordance with the general principles of Part III ofthe London Treaty, and therefore Article 19 as to re-placement construction programmes applied.     under that Article signatory Powers are precluded fromreplacing any overage tonnage during the period ofthe Treaty except that tonnage which becomes overagein 1937, 38 and 39.On our return to Paris on March 1st the Frenchdesired to insert with reference to Article 19 thewords &quot;and which do not conflict with the present arrangement&quot;.     This was because they held that if they accepted the last sentence of Article 19 without re-servation it might be held to prejudge the method bywhich, the overage question was to be settled by the1935 conferencesc     They were quite prepared to acceptthe last sentence of Article 19 and insert it in theAgreement but with the addition of some words such as&quot;without prejudice to the decisions of the 1935conference as to the ultimate settlement of the overagequestion.     Their hope was to secure at the 1935conference a larger amount of new construction than is authorised under the present agreement.     We howevermade it perfectly clear to them that subject to anythingthe 1935 conference might decide, they remained underthe Agreement bound up to the end of 19369 and couldonly
only construct for 1937, 1938 and 1939 within thelimits laid down in the last sentence of Article 19of the Treaty-     This requirement of the French was immediately notified to Signor Rosso the Italian expertby mm Craigie in a letter a copy of which was sentto Mo Massiglio     The latter in his reply said thatthe importance attached hy the French to the 1935Conference, decisions had been correctly stated inMre Craigie&apos;s letter and that the final text must not prevent any decisions of the 1935 conference from entering immediately into forceaIt was not until the drafting committee assembledthat it was made clear that France was demanding a freehand with regard to construction in 1935 and 1936 in replacement of her overage tonnageo     This was certainly not put to us in either of our visits to Parls0The position that arises as a consequence is thatthere is a difference of interpretation as to thenumber of years over which the building of the replace-ment tonnage shall be spread,     Italy and ourselvesconsider that no additional building save for replace-ment of vessels becoming overage in 1937, 1938 and 1939is permissable before 31st December, 1936.    France,on the other hand? considers that she holds the rightto lay down the whole of her replacement tonnage in thefour programme years 1931 - 1934 and thereafter to embark on the construction of vessels in replacement of the large bloc of overage tonnage which she is permitted under the agreement to retain.     The resultof the French thesis would be to give her in the years1931-1934 the largest building programmes of any power in
in the world of which however about one third representscapital ship construction not constructed in 1927-1929as was her righteMassigli has now put forward a compromise which hepersonally is prepared to recommend to his Government,.   -Under this proposal, Francs would spread her replacementover 5 years and the sixth year would lay down such re-placement of the retained overage vessels as was agreed by the 1935 conference;   but failing such agreementFrance would, as from the 1st January 1936 be free fromall restriction.It is considered doubtful whether the Massiglicompromise would be acceptable to italy      If, therefore,we were to endorse it it might not procure an agreement and the result would be still further to inflame Italianfeeling against us0     Already certain of the Italiansseem tc feel that we have gone back on the agreement offer to them in Rome and this new proposal would be regarded in those quarters as a further breach of faith*From an Admiralty point of view the Massiglicompromise proposal is unacceptable for the following reasons :**(a) Even on the ba1sis of a six year agreement theFrench figures for category (b) cruisers and destroyersare higher than had hitherto been contemplated,,     Underthis proposal France would have a large additionaltonnage in this category under construction on 31stDecember 1936, to counter-balance which we could lay downnothing unless we invoked Article 21.     It is incon-ceivable that should we now agree to this proposal wewould
foould be justified in invoking Article 21 in thisrespect in 1935 or 1936.(b) Should we not Invoke Article 21, we willnevertheless at the 1935 conference require to have in mind the probability of some increase in our tonnage to compensate for the increased French bull dingoShould we now either by implication or explicitly havecountenanced this French increase it will be almost impossible to justify to the United States and Japanthe necessary corresponding increase in our tonnage.In effect we should be entering the 1935 conference with our hands tled0(c) It may be argued that we could safely allowsome increase in the French fleet as should the ratio of the French to the Italian fleet remain constant the combined tonnages of the two fleets would still not be equal to cur own.,     Against this argument, however, itmust be pointed out that Italy has built ton for tonwith France during the last six years and there is nodoubt that should France increase her building pro-grammes, Italy will make a corresponding increaseDVarious formulae were drafted at the committeethe main object of which was to provide that, whilstFrance&apos;s construction programmes would be regulatedunder the Agreement for 6 years, this would be withoutprejudice to the decisions of either the 1932 or 1935conferences.     The Italians could not accept any of theformulae, without instructions from Rome, and the onlycne which appeared to have a chance of acceptance in rome (copy annexed) was rejected by the French, whothrough their naval delegate made It clear they intendedto
Jto lay down all their available replaceable tonnage in four years.     This made it increasingly..difficult for the Italians to accept any of the formulae.We have come to the conclusion therefore that, oneof two courses must now be followed:   either(a) to inform Italy that if, and only if Italy isprepared to accept the Massigli compromise, we wouldalso be prepared to accept it or(b) to inform the French that in all the circumstancesof the negotiations recorded above the intention of the bases of agreement must be embodied in the legal draft,and that.we have gone as far as possible in reserving the right of France to raise the question of the replace-ment of her overage tonnage at the 1935 conference.     Weshould be in a stronger position to take this courseif the Italians could first be brought to accept theformula quoted below which was drafted in consultationwith Signor Pilotti, the Legal Adviser of the ItalianMinistry of Foreign Affairs and which would be acceptable to usB     We could then present a united front with theItalians, both Governments interpreting the Bases ofAgreement in the same way and both prepared to offer theFrench the same measure of concession.We must of course emphasise the disastrous political effect of a breakdown at this point, which is indicatedalready by the fact that Signor Grandi has tendered his resignation to Signor Mussolini,.A.Ho
Formula drafted in consultation with theItalian Legal Adviser now in London hut notyet accepted by the Italian government and rejected by the French representatives in London.Subject to any further agreement limiting naval armaments which may be reached at the general disarment Conference of 1932, or at the naval conference which will take place in 1935 inaccordance with Article 23 of the Treaty of London,the additional replacement tonnage which France andItaly may lay down before December 31st, 1936,shall be the tonnage of vessels which will becomeoverage in 1937, 1938 and 1939.
