The^e was souse small uncertainty as to the precisef\R, terms on which the owners had intended that work3(3^1. t 1. should be resumed^ and the President of the Boardef Trade undertook to clear up the point with theowners when he met them later in the afternoon.The Cabinet discussed what method could beemployed if it were desired to enforce the award.of the  National Industrial Board.   The difficulty was realised to be that there was not sufficientmoney in the industry to maintain it in accordancewith the award unless a number 0^ the less economicpits were closed down.    It was pointed out that from the first it had. been made clear to tke minersthat while the- Government w.ere willing to ask parliament to deal with hours by legislation, theywere not prepared to take any responsibility inregard to wages..   The Miners&apos;&apos; Federation leadaccepted this position and had undertaken to dealwith, wages themselves.The Prime Minister suggested to tke President)of the board of Trade that he should impress onthe mine-owners the seriousness of the situation,on which they were- entering by opposing theoperation of an Act ef Parliament, and might, ifhe thought desirables intimate that if theypersisted in^their attitude the Government wouldhave to consider very &quot;carefully the course thatthey would advise Parliament ta take..
