1. The Cabinet had before them the following-documents on the subject of Air Raid Precautions and national Voluntary Service:-A Memorandum (CP.-245 (58)), circulatedby direction of the Prime Minister1,proposing (l) the appointment of amember of the Cabinet to be responsiblefor the planning and co-ordination ofall branches of the above services;(2) the setting up of a ministerial sub-Committee of the Committee ofImperial Defence, under the Chairman-ship of the Home Secretary (as theMinister designated &quot;&apos;&quot;o be Minister for home Security in time of war), of whichthe new Minister v/ould be a member,;and (5) the establishment of an Inter-Departmental Siib-Committee, under theChairmanship of the new Minister:A Note by the Minister for Co-ordinationor Defence (CP.-255 (58))   furtherconsideration of which had been deferredat the Meeting mentioned in the margin  covering a Memorandum by the Chairmanof the Sub-Committee of the Committeeof Imperial Defence on the Control ofMan-Power.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had called theCabinet together specially so that an announcement onthis matter might be made as soon as Parliament met.The proposal made in the Paper which had been circulated by his direction (CP .-243 (58)) wasthat a member of the Cabinet should be appointedwho would be responsible for the planning and co-ordination of Air Said Precaution Services and national Voluntary Service,     Mr Raid Precautions workin the wider sense must be performed by the eightDepartments whichwere already concerned with it.It was proposed that the Home Secretary, as the Ministerdesignated to be Minister for Home security in time of war, should be Chairman of a Committee ofMinisters in charge of the Departments concernedwith this work.     The new Minister whom it v/as proposedto appoint would be Chairman of the Inter-Departmental
Committee and subject to &quot;one Council of ministers would be responsible for planning, organising-andco-ordinating the v/ork.       He would also be indirect charge of the Air Raid Precautionswork of theHome Office, which, however, could not be divorced from that Department.       He proposed that Sir JohnAdnerson should be appointed to this new Ministerialpost.       He had seen Sir John, who was ready toaccept the position and had concurred in the arrange-ments proposed in the present Paper.     Sir john anderson would hold the post of Lord Privy SealcIn effect he would be Minister for Civilian defence.Some discussion ensued in regard to the title bywhich the new Minister should be known.     Variousprecedents were quoted.      It v/as agreed that it wouldbe undesirable to have recourse to legislation forthe purpose of conferring on the new post a statutorytitle such as &quot;Minister for Civil Defence&quot;.    It wasalso agreed that the announcement should make it clearthat specific functions in regard to Civil defence had been assigned to the holder of the new post.THE MINISTER OP LABOUR said that he felt some difficulty in regard to the present proposal inasmuch as the new iiinister was to combine executive responsi-bility for Air Raid Precautions services with authority to plan and co-ordinate ^ir Raid Precautionsand National Voluntary Service.     Thus the Handbookwhich it was proposed to issue would containparticulars of a number of services which might well prove in certain cases to be competing services.V/as it right that the Minister who had executive responsibility for, and was therefore particularlyinterested in, one of the services calling for volunteers,     should be in the position of
co-ordinating his demands with those of&apos; otherDepartments?     He thought this difficulty v/ould arise in particular in regard to persons who were not-pri^r^^iy-^^lreyed. in industry and in waose case it might he difficult to determine in which fieldthey would &quot;best &quot;be employed.     He thought that there ought to be an executive Minister in charge or the *.irRaid Precautions work of the Home Office, and thattaere should be another L-inister to co-ordinate thework of the Civil Departments.THE SECRETARY OP STATE PGR ./AR said that he felt much the same difficulties as those expressedby the iiinister of Labour in regard to the eombina-tion of executive and co-ordinating responsibilityproposed for the new Minister.THE secretary OP STaTE POR PGREIGil AEFAIRSsaid he thought it was necessary to consider notmerely how the scheme would work in practice, butalso how it would impress public opinion.     from the latter point of view the importance attached tothe new Minister would suffer by reason of the factthat while he presided over the Inter-DepartmentalCommittee, the home Secretary presided over the ministerial Committee.      This would be regarded by&apos;..ho public as a case of overlapping.     lie suggestedthat from this point of view the right plan v/ould be to follow the procedure adopted in regard tothe Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRi.DE thoughtthat this difficulty was a more serious one than thedifficulty adduced by the Minister of Labour.
In the course or discussion it was explained that in thefirst instance it had been the intention that the Inter-Departmental Committee should be presided over by sir VarrenFisher, but that when it had been proposed to appoint sir john Anderson to this new post it was thought to bedesirable that, in view of Sir John&apos;s special experience,he should be asked to preside over the Inter-DepartmentalCommittee.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that unless thearrangement proposed in the present I-aper was adopted itwould be necessary to appoint not one but two Ministers..     Hethought that the arrangement proposed was preferable to thelatter course.THE HOME SECRETARY said that Air Raid Precautions workin the narrower sense was inter-locked with the wider work ofco-ordination and he thought that it was essential that thesame Minister should both have direct reponsibility for theAir Raid Precautions work at the Home Office and should dealwith the work of co-ordination.THE PRIME MINISTER thought that it was necessary to dealseparately with the tv/o Questions:    first, whether the new-Minister should be responsible for Voluntary National service as well as for Air Raid Precautions;    secondly, whether thenew Minister should be Chairman of the Standing Committee ofMinisters.     With regard to the former point, he thought thatbroadly speaking the Voluntary National Service work would befound to form part of the Air Raid Precautions work.In the discussion which ensued, it was pointed out thatthe proposed handbook contained particulars of service underthe Defence Departments. It was also explained that there wasa Committee under the Chairmanship of Lady Denman organisinga scheme of women land-workers which might conflict v/ith theCommittee under the Chairmanship of Lady Reading, dealing v/ithwomen Air Raid Precautions workers.     The view was expressed
that any difficulties or conflicts which might&quot;arise could he dealt with through the existing machinery.     Thus senior officers from the three Defence Services were members ofthe inter-Departmental Committee.     If need be, theService Ilinisters could be invited to attend meetings of the ministerial Committee should occasion arise.In regard to the question of the Chairmanship of theCommittee of Ministers,  the HOME SECRETARY pointed out thatone of the complexities of the situation was that the HomeSecretary continued to be responsible for police and fire brigades,while the new Minister was to be responsible forAir Raid Precautions.     He was satisfied that he andSir John Anderson could v/ork the scheme satisfactorily,although it might be to some extent tentative and might call for a review at some later date.     Thus, it might ultimately be necessary to have a separate idr Raid PrecautionsDepartment.     He was conscious of certain illogicalitiesin the arrangement whereby he (the Home Secretary) preside over the Ministerial Committee while the new Ministerpresided over the inter-Departmental Committee.      If itwould help the presentation of a new organisation to thepublic that the new Minister should preside over theCommittee of Ministers, he would offer no objection. /On the question   whether     the same Minister shouldbe responsible for Air Raid Precautions and NationalService, the MINISTER OP AC-agriculutre AND FISHERIESdid not think that there would be any real clashof interests.     Logically no doubt the arrangementproposed was somewhat anomalous but he felt sure that thenew Minister would hold the scales fairly.     He had been impressed by the view of the Secretary of State for Foreign
Affairs and others of his colleagues in regard to theeffect on public opinion of the proposals for theChairmanship of these two Committees.      He enquire whether it v/as necessary to include in the announcementany reference to the Chairmanship of the Committees.THE HOME SECRETARY thought that the public announcement v/ould lose a good deal of force if this information was not published.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER agreed with theview of the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.    Therewas force in the formal objection that the new minister would have to co-ordinate requirements of the department for which he had direct responsibility with requirementsof other. Departments, but in practice he thought nodifficulty would arise.    The point in regard to theChairmanship of these Committees was,  in his view, muchmore diff icult.In the course of further discussion, reference was made to the somewhat analagous position whereby the Prime Minister was Chairman of the Committee ofImperial Defence but the Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence normally presides over the Committee&apos;s meetings.It was pointed out, however, that the analogy was not quite exact since the Prime Minister has no departmental responsibility.    If the Home Secretary v/afe not present at a meeting of the Committee of Ministers, it wouldbe necessary for the Home Office to be represented atthe meeting.THE MINISTER POR CO-ORDINATION OP defence said he was content with the arrangements proposedprovided it was made clear (on the lines explained inthe Memorandum) that the Committee of Ministers was tobe a Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence.
It was,  of course, necessary to make certain that thedemands of the Civil Departments in such matters asSupply, Man Power and Transport were not dealt with in isolation and without reference to the requirements ofthe Service Departments.It was agreed that the necessary co-ordinationcould be secured if need be by Service Ministers beinginvited to attend the Committee of Ministers v/henmatters affecting their Departments were under discussionAfter further discussion, the cabinet agreed:-(a) Subject to (b) below, to approve theproposals for the appointment of a cabinet minister who would be responsible for planning and co-ordination of all branchesof (l) Air Raid precautions and (2) NationalVoluntary Service on the general lines setout in the prime Minister&apos;s paper(CP.  243 (38)).(b) That the Chairmanship of the proposed committee of Ministers should be dealt withon the following lines:-&quot;The Home Secretary is the Ministerdesignated to take the presidency in times of emergency of a Committee ofMinisters whose Departments are specially concerned with the HomeFront.    The position remains, butit is agreed that for the time beingthe new Minister shall be ActingChairman of this Home Front Committee,keeping close contact with the HomeSecretary, who will retain hisultimate responsibility and continue in the closest touch with theproceedings of the Committee.&quot;(c) That the public announcement dealing withthis matter should make it clear that thenew Minister would,  in effect, be a minister for Civil Defence. .
A MINISTRY OPSUPPLY WITHVOLUNTARYPOWERS TOACCELERATEPRODUCTION.(previous reference:Cabinet 50(38), Con-clusion 4).F/?. 5* (59)7-2. In pursuance of the Conclusion mentioned inthe margin, the Cabinet had under consideration aMemorandum by the Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence (CP. 240 (38)) on the desirability orotherwise of establishing a Ministry of Sunplywith voluntary powers to facilitate acceleratedproduction by ensuring the best possible use ofthe available labour in the country.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OP DEFENCEsummarised the main points in his Paper,      Inparagraph 4 he had instanced several ways in whichthe supply of labour for re-armament could beincreased.      In paragraphs 5 to 7 he had indicatedways in which labour v/as being provided at thepresent time.     In paragraph 8 he had stated his conclusion that this task must be peiformed by theEmployment Exchange system, working through theemployers.So far as concerned labour supply he was unable to recommend the establishment of &quot;aMinistry of Supply with voluntary powers&quot;, and fromthe general standpoint of supply he saw no advantage to be gained by it.     He suggested,however, with a view to affording some relief to the Service Ministers in regain&apos;d to problems oflabour supply, the appointment of a parliamentary secretary to his own Office.     This Minister couldact as his representative in any consultationsas to labour supply between the Service departments and the Ministry of Labour, and could assist him in a number of other Supplj&apos; questions which would arise from the intensification of the defence programmes.
Some discussion ensued as to the procedure bywhich the labour requirements of the service Depart-ments v/ere now dealt with.      It was explained that each Defence Department had a Co-ordinating Commiotee,on which the ministry of Labour was represe:rced0It v/as suggested hat if difficult questions of priority arose, these questions could be settled by the proposed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister,This Co-ordinating Committee would also deal with another important aspect of the problem, which wasthat in many cases probably the right solution was totake the work to the men   rather than to attempt totransfer the men to the work.THE SitSCRLiTARY OP STATii PGR PuRLJIGIT APFaIRSthought that such criticism as che Gover-iment wouldhave to face . ould not be satisfied by the appointmentof a Parliamentary Secretary.     The critics would prefer either that the Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence should carry on his work, or that someprominent industrialist should be called in to assiston the industrial side of production.THE SECRETARY OP STaTE POR ,-i.IR said that, onthe face of it, he thought there was no great needfor the appointment of an additional Minister toassist the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.As regards the proposed industrial adviser, he pointed out that he had already taken steps on theselines in his own Department,,       He thought the wisestcourse would be to stand by the previous decision that it was undesirable to create a new Ministerial^,post to deal with Supply.THE PIRST LORD OP THE ADMIRALTY concurred inthis view.       He explained that ohe Admiralty workedthrough the Engineering Employers1 Federation,
and, by keeping in touch with that organisation, v/asable to place its work in districts which had suitablecapacity and facilities.THE SECRETARY OF ST.^ FOR t/AR said that the JarOffice had also adopted this systenio     He expressed agreement with the statement in paragraph 11 of theMinister&apos;s Paper that the appointment of a Ministryof Supply would lighten the heavy burden at presentfalling on the Defence Ministers.     ^.s to the difficultyof welding the transferred staffs to a new Department,he thought that the staffs could be left where theywere, but should be responsible to a single new Ministerof Supply.      The appointment of a single new minister would, lie thought, have an important effect on publicopinion.      he emphasised the difficulties of persuadingmanufacturers to accelerate &apos;./ar Office work beyond acertain point, where to do so would be prejudicial to their civil work.     lie quoted from the latest Progress Reportof the Ministry of Labour, as to a probable shortage of skilled engineering labour in the future.       In his view the right solution was the appointment of a Minister ofSupply with compulsory powers.      Failing this, he thought the right course was to appoint a Minister who would have full responsibility for Supply work.     In reply to aquestion as to which branches should be transferred tothe New Minister, the Secretary of State for War saidthat he did not propose that ship construction  ahould betransferred to &quot;the new Minister - or indeed the manufactureof aircraft - unless that course was shown to benecessary.     3ut he was in favour of the transfer of othermunitions, including in particular the supplies for whichthe War Office was at present reponsible as common supplies for the Defence Departments.   -THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that he had thought on tnese lines, but had reached a different-10-
conclusion.    Supply was,  at the present moment, a vital matter to the Air Ministry.    He would he preparedto hand over Supply to a Minister with compulsory powers, but he v/as not prepared to hand it over to a minister v/ithout comoulsory powers unless some veryoutstanding person was available for this task.    Failingsuch a solution, he would prefer to retain theresponsibility himself, rather than to hand it overto some other Minister who might not deliver the goods.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER saidthat he thought the advocates of a Ministry of Supplyreally meant a Ministry with compulsory pov/ers.    He hadbeen convinced that a Ministry with compulsory powersv/as not now desirable, and he thought that, shorn of itscompulsory powers, the proposal v/as a mere facade.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE said thathe thought the right course was either to make no changeor to make a really big change.    He thought that thework of the Service Ministers would be facilitated ifsome7means could be found for carrying on the Supplywork v/hich would not attract public criticism.    he agreed that a Ministry of Supply with compulsory powers was not desirable, but he thought that there might be a case for setting up a skeleton organisation which, for the moment, would have no compulsory powers,but which could be clothed with such powers if a fresheffort to make satisfactory progress on a voluntary basis failed.    He thought that the work of getting theright type of labour meant constant attention to smallquestions of detail, and that probably there wasenough work to justify the employment of a whole-timeMinister on this task.
THE HOME SECRETARY pointed out thatif a new Minister were to be appointed, legislation would be required and he thought that at the presenttime it would be difficult to get legislation for merecompromise proposal.    He thought that opinion in the House ofCommons favoured a Ministry with compulsory powers.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up, said thathe thought it was clear that the Cabinet generallydid not favour the suggestion which had been putforward by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence -after consultation with him, and v/ith his approval -for the appointment of an additional Minister.    he himself had thought that, as the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence was in effect called upon toco-ordinate both Supply and Defence matters,   therewas something to be said for the proposed appointment.On the whole he thought that the Governmentshould take their stand on the ground that they werenot satisfied that in present circumstances a case had been established for the setting up of a Ministryof Supply with compulsory powers,    If, however, by voluntary methods they were unable to secure satisfactoryproduction, then the case for a Ministry with compulsory powers might have to be further considered.    A gooddeal could be made of the point that we had had to start from scratch and cvercome various difficultiesbefore effective production could be started;In the course of further discussion it waspointed out that a great deal had been done in theway of dilution of labour, but this was much better
SIdone locally and without the attention which wouldbe   attracted if the matter v/ere raised centrally.The Cabinet agreed;-(a) To confirm the view expressed atthe previous discussion that, inpresent circumstances, the settingup of a Ministry of Supply with compulsory powers was undesirable.(b) That the establishment of a Ministryof Supply without compulsory powerswas also undesirable.(c) That the proposal for the appointmentof an additional Minister to assistthe Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence should not be further pursued.
3. THE PRIME MINISTER said that he would speaknext day when the House re-assembled and he would haveto deal with foreign policy, both generally and inrelation to our re-armament programme.Our Foreign Policy was one of appeasement:   We mustaim at establishing relations with the Dictator powers which will lead to a settlement in Europe and to a sense of stability.There had been a good deal of talk in the countryand in the Press about the need for rearmament by thiscountry.     In Germany and Italy it was suspected thatthis rearmament was directed against them, and it was important that we should not encourage these suspicions.The Prime Minister said that he proposed to makeit clear that our rearmament was directed to securing ourown safety and not for purposes of aggression against othercountries.A good deal of false emphasis had been placed onrearmament, as though one resxilt of the Munich agreement had been that it would be necessary for us to add to ourrearmament programmes.     Acceleration of existing programmes was one thing, but increases in the scope ofour programme which would lead to a new arms race was adifferent proposition.The Prime Minister hoped that it might be possibleto take active steps and to follow up the Munich agreement by other measures, aimed at securing better relations.The putting into effect of the Anglo-Italian agreement would be one step in this direction.     He also hoped thatsome day we should be able to secure a measure of limitationof armaments, but it was too soon to say when this would prove possible.     An improvement in confidence was firstnecessary..     He proposed, therefore, to make a reassuringstatement on the morrow.
THE SECRETARY OF&apos; ST,iTE FOR AIR referred in thisconnection to proposals which he had recently submitted in regard to t.ie air programme.     He thought that in presenting the decision to be reached on these proposals,it would be necessary to emphasise their defensiveaspect.      jT.t the present time we were seriously deficientas compared v/ith Germany,     Indeed, our weakness mightbe said to be likely to provoke aggression by others.THE SECRETLY 01&apos; STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS thoughtit was necessary to balance tv/o factors in foreignpolicy.      First, that our diplomacy v/as dependent upon our strength, and secondly that at the present timethe Dictators were in a jumpy frame of mind.     TheSecretary of State referred to a conversation Which hadtaken place between H. Francois Poncet, the french ambassador in Berlin, and lierr Hitler.     The account ofthis conversation which he (the Secretary of State) hadreceived from Sir Eric Phipps, had been encouraging.The American Ambassador, however, had reported that herr Hitler was obviously suspicious of our attitude,and had said that if Britain were getting ready tofight, this might have some adverse reaction on theNaval Agreement,     He v/as trying to find out whether in fact this last remark had been made.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE referredto the importance of the Government spokesmen in theforthcoming Debates not taking up a position whichmight appear to asLociate the Government with theattitude of the Labour Party, which was now more bellicosethan that oi any other Party.
THE CHANCELLOR OP THE 2XCAE ,UER said that hethought that there would he no dispute on the generalproposition that we should increase our defensivestrength.     The real question was how our action shouldhe presented.     He referred in this connection to thehistory of this country&apos;s action vis-a-vis disarmament,and to the unilateral effort which we had made todisarm which had &quot;brought us to the edge of risk, withoutin any way furthering the cause of disarmament.     astrong oase could now be presented for re-armament on two-fold grounds:    first that from the national pointof view re-armament was necessary for our defensivestrength, and secondly from the international point ofview that we could only disarm from a position of strength.The Cabinet approved the line thePrime Minister proposed to take in his statement.
PARLIAMENTARY     4.     THE PRIME MINISTER said that he proposed, to business.announce the putting into effect of the Anglo-Italian agreement on Tuesday, November 1st.       Aquestion had already been put down for answer onthat day which prevented giving a private notice question.       If the question already put down wasreached, the Prime Minister proposed to say that hewould make a statement on the matter at the end of questions.       There would be a Debate on the subject on Wednesday, November 2nd.     There would be a Dehateon Thursday, November 3rd, on air raid precautions, andon Friday,November 4th,Parliament would meet for thepurpose   only of Prorogation.
5.      THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said thaton the 30th October H.M.S. CIGALA, which intended toproceed down river to protect British Nationals and ships, had been stopped below Macao Fort and informed that the river v/as closed below Moth Point.Subsequently, the CICALA was informed by theJapanese authorities that &quot;the River was closed towarships of 3rd powers&quot;.Another British Gunboat H.M.S. ROBINproceeding from Woochow down river to Canton,escorting British merchant ships with British and american refugees, had, been refused passage on thegrounds that communication between Woochow and Cantonmust be cut off.The Senior Naval Officer, West River, had informed the Japanese Rear Admiral that we could not accept these restrictions on the movement of our ships without explanation of the reason, although we would do our best to keep out of the way of active operations, and that he was communicating with higher authority.The First Lord said that he had been rungup the previous night by the First Sea Lord whoseview was that we could not possibly acquiesce in aposition whereby we allowed Japan to say whether ornot H.M. ships should sail.The First Lord said that he had thought it right to give instructions that the matter should bedealt with by high authority (end not locally at shangai).     Accordingly, the Foreign Office had instructed Sir Robert Craigieto make a strong protest.Sir Robert Craigie had also been instructed to saythat H.M. ships had been ordered to delay for 24 hours
only the movements which they had been instructedto make on the 31st October.The position, therefore, was that our shipsv/ould proceed on their journeys on the morning ofTuesday, the 1st November.     It was possible that theirprogress would be resisted by the Japanese, but thiswas not thought to be likely.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that he concurred in the course which had beentaken, and would be surprised if the Japaneseauthorities did not give way.
U-OTHE LORDPRESIDENTOP THECOUNCIL.6.     THE PRIME MINISTER said his colleagues would observe that Lord Hailsham was not present atthe meeting.     Lord Hailsham had placed his resignation in the prime Minister&apos;s hands.     ThePrime Minister had submitted the resignation to HisMajesty The King who had given his approval.Lord Hailsham had sent the Prime minister a letter, which would be published in due course.In this letter, Lord Hailsham made it clear thatthere was no difference between them on policy but hehad said that he felt he would give the Prime Ministergreater scope for any arrangements he might have inmind, if the Prime Minister had his office also to fill.     The Prime Minister said that he had sent asuitable acknowledgment.The Prime Minister added that he had askedLord Runciman to accept the vacant post of lord president of the Council, and that Lord Runciman had accepted.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1.31st October, 1938.
