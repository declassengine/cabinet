LI I-FRENCH 1.  THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidrVERSATIONS.that he hoped to say something at the next Meeting of theeviouserence: Cabinet as to the topics which he and the Prime Ministerinet 54 (38),inclusion 4).     proposed to examine v/ith French Ministers on theirfrfz.S&amp;(34)i.   forthcoming visit to Paris.     He (the foreign secretary) was preparing a short list of matters v/hichmight be discussed, and he understood that the FrenchGovernment were doing the same.     He thought that the conversations would, for the most part, be by way of ageneral review and exchange of ideas.      There were indications that French public opinion had stiffened ona good many questions;    as, for example, on thecolonial issue.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HOME AFFAIRS said thathe thought that it was very important that we shouldmake some specific statement to the French Governmentin regard to their Air Force, and that we should not allow ourselves to be put off by generalities.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR expressed agreementwith this view.      He himself proposed to visit Franceshortly, accompanied by the Air Member for development and Production. He had formed the impression thatthe French Government thought that they could putmatters right in regard to aeroplane production withina few weeks, and they failed to realise the extent of preparation needed.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat this problem v/as included in his list of questions to be discussed with the French Government.
r Germanies,iousence:et 11(38),conclusion 4),lirow&apos; stopratjons.2,     In connection with the preceding item THE SECRETARYOF STATE POR FOREIGN AFFAIRS recalled that the questionof the future of the former German colonies was one onwhich French public opinion had stiffened considerably.THE PRIME MINISTER said that on the 14th Novemberhe had been asked in a Supplementary Question in the Houseof Commons whether His Majesty*s Government were contemplat-ing the transfer of Tanganyika and other african territories formerly under German rule on any terms, andthat he had answered &quot;No, Sir&quot;,     What he had had in mindin giving this answer was that the colonial issue could onlybe discussed as part of a general settlement.     Such asettlement was clearly impossible in present circumstances,and it followed that there could be no question of a return of colonies to Germany.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said thathe understood that Mr. Pirow would act on the advice given him by the Secretary of State for the Dominions and Colonies,and would be extremely cautious in his attitude to thecolonial question in his conversations in Berlin,   He thoughtthat Mi?c Pirow would make it clear that for the moment no progress could be made in this matter.At a later stage in the Meeting THE SECRETARY OF STATEFOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS added that any approach to Germany was for the time being out of the question.     The Prime Ministerand he had had it in mind for some tine to see whether anything useful could be done by means of some approach to signor Mussolini,     In the meantime he assximed that we should press on with the acceleration of our defence measures andwith administrative arrangements in connection with air raidprecautions, and with a view to encouraging the moderate opinion and discouraging the extremists in Germany,
TURKEY.[(previous reference:Cabinet 28 (38)Conclusion 1)3.      THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGNAFFAIRS referred to the recent change in theForeign Minister in Turkey, M. Aras having beensucceeded by M. Saracoglu Shukru.     He was informed by those who were in a position to express an opinion on the subject that this did not representany change of policy.     Turkey was still disposed to favour the maintenance of very cordial relations v/ith this country.
?9flHE PAR EAST-    .        4. THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGN AFFAIRSfapan and China,    referred to a lengthy telegram (No. 13 Tour   Series A)l&amp;previous from Sir A. Clark Kerr reporting a long talk v/hich reference:Cabinet 54 (38), had had v/ith General Chiang-kai-Shek.     This telegramConclusion 3).raised a number of questions of high policy, and^      . ^   re-challenged decisions taken by the Government in june and July.The Secretary of State added that he doubted whether the Cabinet would feel that the circumstances which had led to those decisions had altered for the better.     He was not, however, yet in a position tosubmit any definite recommendations on this matter tothe Cabinet.
IHE JEWISH PROBLEM.    5o THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGN affairs said that he had been much impressed by the powerful^Previous Reference:.wabinet 33(38) repercussions all over the v/orld of the actionfconclusion 4.)recently taken by Germany against the Jews.     He hadfT/?. f (3a)5&quot;.    had some discussion on the matter with the UnitedStates Ambassador, who had emphasised that in hisviewone very important result of the action taken byGermany had been to produce a strong anti-Britishatmosphere in the United States.     The reason forthis was, presumably, that this country was near athand and that it was supposed that it should have beenable to take some effective steps to stop thepersecution of the Jews.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that he had also received a letter from a largenumber of undergraduate clubs in Oxford, all of which took the view that the Government v/as not takingsufficient action in the matter.The Secretary of State said that his broadimpression was that public opinion in the UnitedStates was now about as critical as it could well be,but that the position could be restored if thiscountry would give a lead which would force theUnited States in turn to take some positive action.He hoped that it might be possible in the course ofthe next day or so for us to lend our support tofairly wide promises of help to the Jews.      Forexample, we might undertake that we would make somelocality in the Empire available for Jewish settlement.He attached great importance to this matter from the
political point of viev/e     He thought it might hehelpful if the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancasterwere asked to submit a statement relating this problem to the general problems raised by the Evian Conference.Consideration of the wider aspects of the mattermust not, however, be allowed to impede immediate action.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES saidthat in general he thought we ought to give as &apos;generous promises of help in the near future as were practicable, even if those promises had to be subjectto some degree of qualification.     Nevertheless itwas important not to exaggerate the possibilities of settlement in the Colonial Empire.     Broadly speaking,rapid absorption of immigrants could only takeplace in centres of industrial activity, but most ofour Colonies were in the main concerned withagriculture.As regards Kenya,  the position was to be examined again, but he doubted whethermit would bepossible to increase substantially/the present volumeof settlement which amounted to some 25 families **-seesaw.    He mentioned that the position in Kenya was complicated by the fact that there had jeen sometrouble in regard to native lands,In Northern Rhodesia, Jewish settlementproposals met with unanimous opposition from the unofficial members of the Council.     He had asked theGovernor to take what action he could to overcomethis opposition.     He thought that it might be our duty to override it.     There were Crown Lands in
Northern Rhodesia which we could dispose of as we wished.     He thought that to begin with the scale of immigration would be comparatively modest, saysome 500/^or so. a- year.      The previous Governor, SirHubert Young, had spoken in terms of settlement inNorthern Rhodesia of thousands or tens of thousands otJews.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had understoodthis to refer not to permanent settlement but to temporary settlement of refugees pending arrangementsfor permanent settlement elsewhere.As regards Tanganyika, THE SECRETARY of state FOR THE CuLONIES hoped that he might be able to effect something.In British Guiana the position was much more hopeful.     He had telegraphed to the Governor and suggested handing over a considerable area for Jewishsettlement.     The proposal was that in the firstinstance some Jewish authority should be asked toexamine the territory and reach a decision on the spot.A considerable area had been examined in regard tothe proposed settlement of the Assyrians.     The area in question was suitable for ranching and it had been thought that some 5,000 Assyrians could be settled on it.     Probably it would take a larger number of Jews,since Jews, judging on experience elsewhere, were capable of closer settlement than other nations.There was another area in British Guiana which mightbe capable of development but which had not yet been
surveyed.      Over and above this there was a vast forestarea which had never really been considered.     Obviouslythis area could only be settled much more slowly, sincethe forest would have to be cut down, but thic areacould be offered to the Jews for what it was worth.The Secretary of State thought it was clear that british guiana did not offer opportunities for the settlementof very large numbers of Jews, at any rate at once,but he was of opinion that the proposal to give theman area in British Guiana was one. which would be important politically.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER suggestedthat we should emphasise our willingness to offer suchan area.THE PRIME MINISTER thought that we should indicate that we were prepared to put certain areas atthe disposal of the Jews.     He had in mind that weshould give them not a freehold, but a long lease on apeppercorn rent, in order to retain some measure ofcontrol.THE HOME SECRETARY thought it was impor tantto make our offer as concrete as possible.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES feltthat the survey which had taken place in british guiana would make this possible.
THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had seen aDeputation of Jev/s on the previous day and had indicated that it might he possible for us to take some action on the lines now proposed.      The Deputationhad pointed out, however, that time was the essence ofthe matter.      It followed that anything which we could do in regard to a permanent settlement must also heaccompanied by some effort to find a temporaryresting-place for refugees while arrangements weremade for their permanent reception.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE DUCHY OP LANCASTER saidthat this aspect of the problem had been studied bythe international c -^organisation set up at the EvianConference.      The Chancellor mentioned some of thedifficulties which he had encountered in dealing v/iththis matter.      The organisation v/as a miniature Leagueof Nations, and there were the usual cross-currents of opinions and interests.      Further, the Director was anelderly American who v/as thought by many people not tomake rapid progress.For some time past the State Department atWashington had been expressing the view that thiscountry was not doing enough.     This was quite untrue.Australia v/as now taking a substantial number, namels^,5,000 a year, due partly to the pressure which had beenbrought to bear upon her.      New Zealand was taking afew.      None were being taken in South Africa.     Asregards Canada he had had satisfactory talks with
Mav-Vincent Massey, v/ho was anxious that his Governmentshould take some action in*the matter.     There wassuitable land in Canada, and he hoped to be able to induce the Canadian Government to take some helpfulmeasures.     All the Jewish Societies were satisfiedthat the problem was one which could only be solved by agricultural settlement.      The action of the UnitedStates Government had been to take 25,000 immigrants from Germany a year, which represented the quota of theold Germany and Austria,      This, however, was only thenormal immigration quota.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster mentioned that the Director of the organisation was anxious tohold a meeting next week, probably on Wednesday, and itwould then be necessary that he (the Chancellor) should indicate the Government1s policy in the matter.Continuing, the Chancellor of the Duchy said thathe thought Guatemala and certain other South american countries would take action in the matter if we could show them a good example.      The crux of the whole question,however, was whether Jews were tcbe allowed to takemoney out of Germany.      This was a question which mustbe discussed with the German Government, but thatGovernment had burked discussion of it for months.      Nolarge-scale emigration could be effected unless this problem could be solved.THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR HOME AFFAIRS thoughtthat the United States of America was the key to theproblem, but that the only way to open the door into theUnited States would be that we should take action inregard to, say, British Guiana, Kenya and northern rhodesia, which would influence opinion in the UnitedStates.     He thought that this action would also be ofimportance on the financial side.
THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGN affairs said that if a &quot;block of land could &quot;be made available it had been suggested to him that a considerable summight be subscribed by private initiative in theUnited States and that the State Department might be induced to take some helpful action.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HOME affairs said that 10,000 n^pliuatiittw a day were being received in the United Kingdom.   All-thtjse applications were sent to a co-ordinating Committee which includedrepresentatives of various Societies and of sl&amp; theimportant Jewish interests.    Broadly speaking, onlycases which were recommended by the Jewish representatives were admitted.    The Jewish representatives were averseirom al&quot;owing very large numbers of Jews to enter thiscountry or from allowing the entry of Jews whom they hadnot themselves approved, since they were afraid of an anti-Jew agitation in this country.    For the same reason they were unwilling to give definite figures as to the number of Jews admitted, since they wereafraid that any number published would be attackedfrom both sides as being too big or too little.    Hethought that we were g ing as far at present as public opinion would allow, and it was important toretain a check on individual immigrants.    He thought,however, that we might agree to admit a number of youngJews for the purpose of agricultural training, with aview to their ultimate settlement elsewhere.    He wasalso in favour of admitting a number of Jewishmaidservants.    These girls might replace the Germandomestics who had left at the time of the crisis.    he mentioned that the Jewish Committee was subscribing 5,000 a week to help immigrants.
THE MINISTER OP HEALTH thought that it was of the utmost importance that something should he done at once, as there was a danger of another Midlothiancampaign.    He thought that any constructive action taken to alleviate the difficulties would appealto Liberal opinion in this country.    He also thoughtthat we should proceed on the basis of alleviating theterrible suffering and humiliation which had beeninflicted on many Jews and that we should take positive action to this end forthwith.    Such action v/ould beexpected by public opinion in this country.    He was certain that it would be necessary to establishcentres in which immigrants could find temporaryshelter before they were moved on elsewhere/here.    Many ofthe Jews now being driven out of Germany would provevaluable citizens, as had been the case with many other refugees who had settled in this country in previous centuries.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCEsympathised with the difficulties of quoting a figure,but he asked how we should get credit for what we were doing unless some figure was given of immigration intothis country?In discussion the view was generally expressed that there would be considerable danger in publishinga figure.In reply to the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, THE HOME SECRETARY undertook to considerwhether a figure could be communicated privately tothe State Department at Washington.- is -
THE PRIME MINISTER thought that if, inaddition to offering a territory overseas, weundertook to allow Jews to come here as atemporary refuge this would constitute aconsiderable cont.rii.iution towards the problem.THE SECRETARY CP STATE PGR 110*\E affairs undertook to consider this point.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LAI-CASTERsaid that the Jewish Authorities were anxious to train a number of their people in agriculture.It was thought that 1,000 could be settled inSouth America in six months, given adequatetraining,TH3 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HOME affairs referred to the older men and women who presentedan almost insoluble problem.    The Jewish Committeewas not attempting to deal with the older people.It was concentrating on the younger people.THE SECRETARY OF ST; TE FOR TH5 DOMINIONSsaid that he hoped it might be possible to induce the Dominions to take some further action.    Hehad spoken to Mr. Bruce yesterday who had agreedthat the 5,000 a year which Australia was takingmight perhaps be put up to 6,000 or 7,000.Mr. Bruce had also agreed that the time had perhapscome when this figure could be quoted.    This figurecompared very favourably with the scale of the effort in the United States.    The suggestion had also beenput forward that an ;:rea might be handed over tothe Jews for settlement in the northern part of western Australia.   Mr. Bruce had promised to con-sider this suggestion but its prospects were notvery hopeful.
THE PRIME MINISTER thought that it would&apos;&quot;be important that a statement should be prepared atthe earliest opportunity to show what action we proposed to take in this matter.      He suggestedthat this statement should be drafted by thefollowing Ministers - the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs,  the Secretary of State for HomeAffairs,  the Secretary of State for the Dominionsand the Colonies,  the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster.This course was agreed to.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSsairi that he had been much impressed by the almosthopeless position of the olrier Jews in Germany,He asked if it was possible that some appeal mightbe made to the people in this country to make themselves responsible for the support of individual elderly Jews who would other/ise beleft to an appalling fate in Germany,,THE PRIME MINISTER thought that thissuggestion might be considered later.The Cabinet agreed :-That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, the Secretary of State for home Affairs,  the Secretary of State forthe Dominions and the Colonies and theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancastershould prepare a statement for issue atthe earliest opportunity setting out theaction which His Majesty&apos;s government proposed to take immediately to deal withthe Jewish problem, and that in preparingthis statement the Ministers concerned should have regard to the suggestions made in the course of discussion.
3 CHO SLOVAKIA.ritish Guaranteeor.previous reference:Cabinet 4938), Con-clusion 2,)2916. The Cabinet had under consideration aMemorandum by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs (CP.-258 (38)) outlining the history ofthe question of a British guarantee for Czeeho-slovakia, and discussing the subject under thefollowing heads(a) What States should be invited toassume th.-- obligations of theguarantee?(b) Whether its form should be jointor several.(c) In what circumstances should theobligations be held to arise?(d) The circumstances in which ourguarantee could be held to havelapsed, in view of changed condi-tions, and the duration of new-guarantees .The Secretary of State suggested that, as a first step, the opportunity should be taken of theforthcoming conversations with French Ministers inParis to exchange views with the French Government,after which we night ask the German and italian governments whether they had any proposals to make.We might also suggest to the French Government thatthey, in their turn, should sound the Soviet Govern-ment as to their attitude.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said he thought that it was right to let the Cabinetknow the proposals which were under consideration in this matter.     He considered the best plan would bethat his Memorandum should be referred to the Foreign
Policy ^Committee.     It would &quot;be seen that at theconclusion of the Paper it was proposed that theopportunity should he taken of conversations with french Ministers in Paris to exchange views on thematter.     The Roumanian Foreign Minister had informed him that he attached the utmost importance to theguarantee of Czechoslovakia being brought into definiteform as early as possible.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR suggested that both this Memorandum and the Paper on South-eastern europe (CP.-257 (38)) might be referred to the Chiefsof Staff Sub-Committee.THE PRIME MINISTER thought that any referenceto the Chiefs of Staff cf either of these Papers wouldhave to be on some specific question arising out oftheir subject matter.     He thought that the best plan would be that the Foreign Policy Committee should have authority to invite the Chiefs of Staff to advise on anystrategical aspects involved in these questions.The Cabinet agreed.To refer the Memorandum&apos;of theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs in regard to the proposedBritish Guaranttee.-for Czechoslovakia(CP. 258 (38)) to the ForeignPolicy Committee of the Cabinet;it being understood that the ForeignPolicy Committee should have authorityto invite advice from the Chiefs ofStaff on any strategical issues involved.
CZECHOSLOVAKIA. 7.      On the invitation of the Prime Minister,the CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER informed theFinancialAssistance to.      Cabinet of the latest position in regard to this(Previous matter.    He reminded his colleagues that theyReference:Cabinet 52(38)   had agreed to an announcement that the Bank of conclusion 9). -^-*-?.c*- ^fcid--England had been authorised to make an advance ofi 5y^3S) 3. 10 millions to Czechoslovakia.    The announcementhad also stated that the question of a guaranteedloan had been mentioned, but that we were anxious toascertain the views of the French Governmentin regard to this matter.The French Government had been consulted and had now stated that they were prepared to relieve the Czechoslovak Government from theresponsibility of providing interest and repaymenton a guaranteed Czechoslovak Loan issued in 1932and amounting to 700 million francs.    This sumwas equivalent to  4 millions at the present rateof exchange, though it had been considerably more at the time it was issued.    This wastantamount to a gift of  4 millions.    It was also proposed that we should indicate our willingness to regard  5 millions of our advance as a freegift.    This action would be regarded ascorresponding to the French cancellation of theexisting loan of 700 million francs.Further, both we and the French should give a joint and several guarantee for a loan of 10 millions to be raised on the London marketon the understanding that 50 per cent of any money required to implement the guarantee wouldbe found by each Government.
It was also proposed that over and above this each Government should give Czechoslovakia such assistance as it thought fit in the matter of export credits.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he v/asdisposed to think that v/e should agrt;e to a settlement on these lines.    He added that he felt two difficulties about this matter.    The first was that -vtar-y little j  7/Ul---money was being spent on refugees.    At the moment lessthan  -g- million had been allocated for this purpose,and it was apparently the intention that most of therest of the money v/ould be spent on railway reconstruc-tion.The second point was how we could be sure that the money which we advanced would not ultimatelyinure to the benefit of Germany.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he thoughtthat one answer/er to this^migh^be^^fehat-if.....wo Tgawe tho-guarantee contemplated in his Memorandum (CP. 258(38))we should ensure an independent Czechoslovakia.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said thatin his view it was impossible to give any help to czechoslovakia which v/ould not involve a certain measure of reflex benefit to Germany..The Cabinet agreed that the Chancellorof the Exchequer should be authorised todeal with the question of financialassistance to Czechoslovakia on thebasis, which he had indicated above, viz.-(a) That we should treat  5 millions of our advance as a gift (the Frenchtreating their existing loan of700 million francs as a free gift).(b) That this country and the french should give a joint and severalguarantee for a loan of  10 millions to be raised on the London market onthe understanding that 50 per cent,of any money required to implement the guarantee would be found by each government.
CENTRAL ANDSOUTH-eastern europe.(previous reference:Cabinet 54(38), Con-clusion 6.)8.      In accordance with the Conclusion mentionedin the margin, the Cabinet had before them a most secret Memorandum by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs (CP.-257 (38)) examining the politic-al implications of the &quot;Anschluss&quot; and the resultsof the recent Czechoslovak crisis, and making recommendations as to what action could now be taken which, while contributing materially towards the promotion of our political influence in South-eastern europe by economic measures, would at the same time be in consonance with the main lines of our foreignpolicy, and in particular of our policy to-uardsGermany.The Cabinet agreed:-To refer the Memorandum (CP.  257 (38))of the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs to the Foreign Policy Committeeon the understanding that that Committeeshould have authority to invite advice from the Chiefs of Staff on any strategicalissues involved.
CEYLON CON-STITUTION.(previous reference:Cabinet 41(37), Con-clusion 6.)9.    The Cabinet had under consideration.aMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies(CP.-254 (38)) pointing out certain respects inwhich the present Constitution of Ceylon had not realised the expectations of the Special Commissionof 1928, on whose recommendations it was based,and summarising the Governor1s proposals for amend-ment.   Subject to the concurrence of his colleagues,the Secretary of State proposed to authorise theGovernor to publish his proposals, and to arrange that they should be debated in the State Council.On the result of that debate would depend the natureof further action.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIESoutlined the main points in the proposed revisionof the Constitution.      The present Constitutionsuffered from serious defects;    the Ministers being elected by Executive Committees had no sense of collective responsibility and often spoke againsteach other in the Council.     The present state ofaffairs had been much criticised and Sinhalesepublic opinion was ready to accept reforms.     Onecourse would have been to appoint another RoyalCommission, but he thought his predecessor had beenwise in adopting another method.     The presentGovernor, who was a man of great ability, had beenasked to make his recommendations after soundingrepresentative opinion in Ceylon.     Among the mostimportant proposals were first, that there should beno reduction in the Governor&apos;s powers, secondly,the abolition of the Executive Committees, thirdly,the selection by the Governor of the Leader of theCouncil who would then choose his Ministers, inconsultation with the Governor, and fourthly, adequate safeguards for Minorities.- 20 -
The Secretary of State for the Coloniesasked authority for the Governor to publish theproposals and for them to be discussed in the state council.      If the Governor&apos;s proposals were approvedby a considerable majority and were not opposed byany important interest, he proposed that the proposals should be adopted forthwith without further referenceto the Cabinet-     He thought that there was areasonable chance that the proposals would be accepted.It was believed that 40 out of 50 elected members were likely to give substantial support to theproposals.     The remaining 10 elected membersrepresented the Minority elements, and he thoughtthat support of a number of these members also wouldbe obtained if they were given a hint that considerable importance was attached by the Secretaryof   State for the Colonies to the proposals tosafeguard the interests of minorities.     A finaldecision whether the Governor&apos;s proposals could beadopted immediately could not, however, be reacheduntil it was seen what sort of reception they received.The Cabinet agreed:That the Secretary of&apos;State for theColonies should have authority to instruct the Governor to publish the proposals set out in C.P. 254 (38)for the reform of the Constitutionof Ceylon, and that, if general opinion was in favour of the principlesof the Governor&apos;s recommendations, heshould proceed without delay to draft the necessary amending Order-in-Council.
