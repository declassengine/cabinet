ANGLO-AMERICANTRADEAGRERvCENT.(previous reference:Cabinet 49(58),Conclusion 9.)1. THE PRILIE MINISTER said that He thought hiscolleagues would be glad to know that the UnitedStates Government had agreed to the latest proposalswhich we had submitted for an Anglo-American trade agreement.     lie was sure his colleagues.es would wish to congratulate the President of the Board of Trade onthis outco:.:e of the negotiations.The Treaty had not yet been signed.      Indeed,it was probable that signature would not take placeuntil the end of this week or the beginning of next week.      It was therefore of the utmost importance thatthis news should be regarded as strictly confidential for the -present.

The Committee&apos;srecommendations as amended in discussion in the cabinet are set out in full below.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE explainedthat a number of the proposals put forward in the Committed&apos;Report could be met within the sum which had been allocated to the Admiralty for the last three years ofthe quinquennium covered by the Defence Loans Act(i.e. the three years April 1939 to March 1942).
The.sura so allocated was  410 millions, this figure being.a compromise between the figure of  443 millions askedfor by the First Lord of the Admiralty, on the basisof the New Standard Fleet, and the Minister&apos;sprovisional allocation of  355 millions.aragrsph 2; With regard to the proposal to lay down at oncescort Vessels.a first batch of 10 escort vessels, the minister  explained that during the crisis the Admiralty hadbeen impressed with the shortage of vessels for convoyand escort work.     The First Sea Lord was most anxious that steps should be taken to remedy this deficiency.The ships could not be laid down until May, 1939, butsteps   could be taken forthwith to start collecting thenecessary material.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that underthe Anglo-German Naval Agreement we were bound to notifyany change  in our programme to Germany during the first four months of the calendar year.     In effect, it wouldbe necessary to give notice early in tgsmsEBgB, 1939, ifwe proposed to lay down the second batch of 10 escort vessels before May, 1940.     As a result of furtherconsideration the Admiralty thought that this latter datewas too late.     He therefore asked for authority to notify&apos;Germany early in 1939 of the proposal to lay down 20escort vessels in all in the ensuing twelve months.     Ifthis was to be done, it would probably be nece&apos;ssaryto inform the House of Commons before the ChristmasRQCOJB&amp;,    He explained that the notification whichwas made to Germany at the beginning of the calendar year must include our whole programme for the year.(.
THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP -TRADE -B^eased.the importance which his Department attached to &apos;thbeing a sufficiency of these vessels.      A short-age of vessels for convoy would seriously upset the arrangements made for control of shipping.It might result in convoys having to wait eightor ten days before they could sail.THE SECRET.-.RY OP STATE POR FOREIGN AFFAIRS,asked by the Prime Minister as to the effect on germany of an armouncement that we proposed to lay down 20 of these vessels in the next finan-cial year, said it was necessary to hold thebalance evenly between what we needed for defence and the effect of our defence plans on Germany.It was imperative that Germany should be given no justification for saying that we were preparing for war against her and, on that account, for denouncing the Anglo-German Naval-agreement.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that he did not feel very strongly aboutthe proposal to lay down, these 20 escort vessels.Looking at our relations with Germany from a wider point of view the Secretary of State saidthat he thought that steps should be taken inthe near future to prevent the Munich waxsetting too hard before we had talcen some further action towards implementing our policyof appeasement.     He was not, at the moment,
in a position to make a definite suggestion,but he thought that we might tell germany that we should like to know whether she had any suggestions as to how the outstandingmatters should be discussed.THE PRIME LIIITISTER said that he v/as not altogether happy about the proposal to increase our programme by laying down these 20 escovtvesselSc.      He had come to the conclusion, however,that the right course was to agree to thisproposal, subject to its reconsideration beforethe end of the year if this should appear tobe highly desirable from the point of view ofthe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.This course was agreed to.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCEthen explained briefly the other proposals inthe Cabinet Committee&apos;s Report relating to theAdmiralty programme,.It was agreed that it should be considered whether the Southern Railway should be invitedto bear some share of the cost of dredging DoverHarbour.     The view was expressed, however,that the dredging would not be of much value to the Railway Company,,
1a3war office programme.Anti-Air oral&quot; tEquipment.(Paragraph 16)THE MINISTER FOR CO-OiUINATION OF DEFENCEexplained that the main proposals relating to theArmy dealt with A.A. defences.     The so-called&quot;Ideal Scheme&quot; for the Air Defence of Great britain had provided for 1264 guns of modern tjfpes.     Thepresent authorised scheme v/as for 928 guns, of which320 woull he the 3&quot; guns relined.      In passing, he observed that it was a mistake to regard the 3&quot; gunsas ineffective.The present proposal was that the number ofAc equipments authorised for the Air Defence ofGreat Britain should be increased to 1264, allmodern types.     In addition, another 50 or so gunsshould be provided for ports abroad, making a totalof 686 additional guns of new types.In order to obtain the additional guns, itwould be necessary to create new capacity, and it was desired to place an order now for 300 guns to enablethe necessary additional capacity to be built up.The Minister also pointed out that, tosome extent, the present proposal was linked up. withthe provision of capacity for field guns.     At thepresent time, A.A. guns had absolute priority.      Itwas, however, impossible to employ our capacity forgun manufacture indefinitely on the production ofA.A. guns to the exclusion of field guns.     The new capacity was therefore required in order to enablethe additional A.A. guns to be produced withoutstill further postponement of the provision of fieldgunso     He thought that the present proposal would meet most of the criticism that we had not got enoughA?A&quot; guns.
.1   4A. K  -tIn reply to questions, it was explained that itwas proposed to create the new capacity by the extensionof an existing factory.     Possible labour difficulties hadbeen discussed with the firm concerned (Messrs. VickersArmstrong), who thought that they would be able to find the necessary labour.     Broadly speaking, the additionalguns ordered were required, not to protect additionalareas, but to provide a thicker concentration.     It was a fact that, at the present time, we had demands for guns ofthese calibre from other sources, within and without theEmpire, which we were unable to meet.THE HOME SECRETARY thought that the increaseproposed was inevitable.     His only doubt was whether theincrease proposed was adequate.     He suggested that whenthe proposals now under consideration had been dealt withby the Cabinet, it might be desirable that the Chiefs ofStaff should again consider the whole question of HomeDefence from &quot;the point of view of advising whether theprogramme as altered by the additions now proposed   wasproperly balanced.It was agreed that the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence should take the necessary steps tosecure a further review of the Home Defence picture onthe lines proposed by the Home Secretary.The Committee^ recommendations ae to A.A.equipments were approved.Jing It was explained that the orders dealt with.intion FirmsEduction,   paragraph 20 related mainly to shell of different typesagraph 20)(mainly field gun shell) and that the additional order now;proposed was not in exoess of ultimate Army requirements,although it was in excess of what had already been:authorisedAfter discussion, the Committee&apos;s proposals inthis paragraph were accepted.
Iloiopensation-ln connection[ith Priorities,[paragraph 234THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that he did not deny that cases such as those referred to inthis paragraph might arise in which some concession would be necessary.     He thought, however,  thatthere was a great difference betv/een adopting theprooedure now proposed as a standard formula, andacting on the lines suggested in exceptionalindividual cases.     He was afraid that if the formerprocedure was adopted,  there might be cases where a civil customer and contractor would share the proceeds of the Penalty Clause,     He thought it was most undesirable that the procedure suggested shouldbe included in the authorised practice of GovernmentDepartments.THE LORD CHANCELLOR suggested that it mightbe possible to deal with the matter by a Bill which provided that if a certificate of particular urgencywas issued, the Government would have the right torequire absolute priority, and. that in such cases any loss sustained by the firm should be recouped.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADEthought that this matter required very careful handling and he suggested that the few cases which-had arisen should be dealt with ad Jboc-o
It v/as agreed to accept therecommendation made by the Committee, subject tothe addition of the words&quot;on the basis that eachcase is dealt with on its merits&quot;*With regard to the role of the Army,the MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OP DEFENCE saidthat a long memorandum had been submitted making proposals to increase the effectiveness of theArmy.,     The Committee had felt that, as a majorquestion of policy was involved, it would not be within their Terms of Reference to deal with thismemorandum, and they thought that the matter should be remitted to the Committee of ImperialDefence .THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said thatthe General Staff were very anxious that theirviews on this matter should be set on formalrecord.     In their view, the Army was at presentunable to fulfil certain of its obligationsoHe (the Secretary of State) added that he attached considerable importance to the proposals to increase the equipment of the Territorial Armyand he thought that the best plan would be totake these two matters up at the Committee ofImperial DefencecThis course was agreed to.(The First Lord of the Admiralty left themeeting at this point.)
THE MINISTER FOR COORDINATION CP DE7E2TCEsaid that the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theSecretary of State for Air had conferred on thismatter which had very serious financial implications.The Appendix to the Committee&apos;s Report set outthe stage reached in the discussions between those tv/o Ministers at the tine when the Committee1sReport had been submitted.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR said thathe had found it necessary to circulate a lengthypaper, as he was anxious that this colleagues should have before them the position as seen bythe Air Ministry.     He wished to express his thanks to the Chancellor of the Exchequer for the attitude that he had adopted in their discussions.He thought that it would be generally agreed that the air defences of this country-occupied a position of very special importance.It v/as Germany&apos;s strength in the air and therelative weakness in this sphere of the other powers which was the main factor causing the unrest and anxiety which existed in the world to-day.Again, from the point of view of world appeasement,our own weakness in the air was obviously a serioushandicap to our diplomacy.      If our- air strengthcould be increased, it would give strength to thePrime Minister in his further efforts for peace.It would also assist us in the efforts which we hoped to make to obtain limitation of armaments.     It wasonly by strengthening our air position that we could give our diplomacy the help which it required.
Prom the domestic point of view,our weakness in the air was the cause ofgreat anxiety to the country.     The position ofthe Government in this matter was furthercomplicated by the pledges which had beengiven in regard to our air strength.      these were interpreted by people as meaning that v/we should attain some measure of equality with anyaggressor who was in a position to attack us.This was a matter which was very uifficult todeal with in the course of rebate.     TheMemorandum which had been submitted by the LabourParty at the end of the Summer Session containedwhat appeared to be information obtained from theAir Ministry, including an estimate of the air strength of this and other countries.These, said the Secretary of State forAir, were the main factors in the position whichhis Paper was intended to meet.      He thoughtthat the paper disclosed a serious state ofaffairs.      He was sure, however, that it contained no exaggeration, and was certainly not based on any over-estimate of Germanstrength.      If anything, perhaps it under-estimatedGerman strength and in particular the capacity ofthe German aircraft industry.If v/e had had to engage in war in September,our position, so far as the air was concerned, wouldhave been very grave.     Our first line was weak,and so far as reserves were concerned, the position was highly precarious.     We could only have continued an effective fight in the air for a very short period.
His colleagues might ask whether this- state of affairs would not he remedied when theprogramme authorise a in May last, when LordSwinton was Secretary of State for Air, hadbeen implemented.      That programme, however,was not based on any measures of equality withGermany.     Rather it was based on the principleof giving sufficient orders fully to occupy theaircraft industry for a given period.      Indeed,when the present programme was completed, weshould have made but a very limited advance inthe direction of approaching German strength in the air.     He invited attention in thisconnection to paragraph 35 of CP. 218(38j.The position clearly called for some further action.      He was confident that the further&quot;action to be taken should be founded on twoprinciples:    firstly, a considerable increase inour reserve strength and the further equipment ofour force with the latest types of machines.     Theresult would be to bring about a great increase inthe real strength of the Air Force.     We should add depth as well as length to the organisation.We should build up a Force which could continue to operate over a considerable period, and this involved the development of our productive capacity.Secondly, we must concentrate   en.building up our fighter strengths      He was glad tosay that the Chancellor of the Exchequer did not dissent from these two proposals.
The Secretary of State then dealt with our bomber strength, which he regarded as our counter-d^fensive.Bombers were a very expensive item indeed, and anyconsideration of his programme from the financial pointof view would naturally be largely concerned with this item.The Secretary of State said that his own view,and that of the Air Ministry, was that while it was right that we should build up a strong force of fighters,nevertheless if our real aim was to prevent war,  it wasnecessary that we should also have a sufficient bomber force to ensure that any country wishing to attack us would realise that the game was not v/orth the candle.  Inother words, the bomber force was the best deterrent toavoid war.    Further,  a heavy bomber programme afforded thebest means of enabling this country to get on level terms with Germany.    Germany&apos;s policy had been to concentrate on giving large orders for a limited number of types: alsoGermany did not make alterations in her programme untilshe had attained a substantial measure of strength.    Itwas possible for this country, which came into the fieldlater,  to concentrate on heavier types, which were capableof inflicting a much greater degree of damage and whichwould thereby give us some advantage.From the financial point of view, we could obtain a bomber force with a given bomb lift at lesscost if we constructed heavy bombers than if weconstructed medium bombers.A considerable proportion of the aircraft industry was engaged in manufacturing heavy bomber types,
and it was impossible to contemplate discharges fromthe industry at the present time.There was the further consideration that if wewere to succeed in building up a reasonable productivecapacity, it was necessary to place follow-on orders totake the place of the orders now being carried out.The Secretary of State for Air said that he-attached a special importance to the proposal inparagraph 34 of his Memorandum for the purchase offurther jigs and tools and materials.    He thought thatif the worst came to the worst, then the action proposed under this head would enable us to meet the situation.The Secretary of State then referred to anumber of ancillary proposals  contained in his memorandum, e.g.,  the increase in the Royal Air Force,Volunteer Reserve and training facilities.    He thoughtthat these matters could be dealt v/ith by theChancellor of the Exchequer and himself in consultation,and that it would not be necessary for them to bediscussed in the Cabinet.The Secretary of State for Air then dealtwith the presentation of these proposals, which was ofthe utmost importance, first from the point of viewof their repercussions on Italy and Germany, and secondly from the point of view of Parliamentary upinionat home.As regards the former aspect, he gave someparticulars of a conversation which had taken place between the German Air Attache and the Chief of the
Air Staff that morning, as the result of a statement in the Sunday press that we were proposing to carryout an immediate large increase in the strengthof the Air Force.    This conversation, he thought,showed the importance of emphasising the defensivecharacter of our programme.The Secretary of State for Air proposed thatany statement should make it clear that we intendedto give highest priority to the strengthening ofour fighter force and particularly in regard toreserves.    So far as &quot;bombers were concerned, he proposed to say no more than that the governments intention v/as to increase the reserves of our counter-defensive force and to make provision pax^ticularlyfor the large numbers of aircraft of special typesindispensable for training.The Secretary of State emphasised that he didnot propose to make any announcement in regard toour reserve strength.    Nor did he propose to makeany statement as to our intention to concentrate onthe heavy bomber type.He also proposed to indicate that there wouldbe a review of our overseas requirements,  and thatour overseas strength would be increased,  if neces-sary, in the light of that review.    He would also refer*ho the necessity for accelerating the training of theRoyal Air Force reserve and of t.hQ Royal  M.v fbroi itself
The Secretary of State also thought that, whilstit should be made clear that v;e did not withdraw anyof our previous declarations in regard to oixr air strength, it was important that we should now state our objective, namely that we must possess an Air Forceadequate for our own necessities so that no country, byreason of our weakness, would be tempted to attack us.Up to this point, the Secretary of State continued,his proposals in regard to presentation had been mainlydirected to the position vis-a-vis Germany.The other side of the picture was that it wasnecessary to reassure the country that r. real effortw^s now being made so far as the Air was concerned.He proposed to say that wc were increasing our first line Fighter strength &quot;rw 30&amp;      For the rest,all that could be saiu. would necessarily be expressed in very general terms.      He therefore proposed,  in orderto give the country some real measure of the steps wewere taking, to express the position in terms of money.The figure stated should not be of such a nature as to provoke undesirable repercussions in Germany, but should give reasonable assurance so far as this country wasooncerned.      He proposed that the public announcement on this point should be settled by the Prime Minister,the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Foreign secretary and himself, in consultation.
(lie difficulty in this cojoue.c_t.ion wa-a^that ifhe gave the figure of additional cost resulting fromthe &quot;present proposals for the first year only, that figure would he comparatively small, althoughthe programme now put forward represented a very real attempt by this country to make up for ourdeficiencies in the Air.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCIU&apos;juIi.R dealt first withthe effect of the present proposals on the country&apos;sfinanceSo       When the Cabinet Committee had startedtheir deliberations they had decided -chat, while theywould deal with particular proposals individually, their decisions in regard to those proposals should be subjectto review when the picture could be seen as a whole.Owing to ohe time factor it had not been possible forthe Committee to give any conspectus of their proposals as a whole.The Chancellor reminded his colleagues that, two and a half years ago, the country had embarked upon a fiveyears&apos; programme of re-armament.       The amount of the programmes to be met by borrowing had been fixed at5400 millions.       Since the total of the programme was then put at  1,500 millions, the cost of the programme to be met by taxation was  1,100 millions over five years.The second stage in the programme had been the review carried out by the Minister for Co-ordinationof Defence.     An allocation or ration had been fixed for the Admiralty and for the War Office,^-u -yfbsuch allocation had been fixed for the Air Ministry.The present proposals now altered the positionsubstantially.     It was certain that the cost of tikeProgrammes as now presented would be over  2,000millions, and it might well be  2,100 millions for thequi ncjuenni urn.
In 1957 we had spent  262 millions on defence,including Air Raid Precautions. 1958 the figurewa s  369 millions, making a total for the two yearsof  631 millionso      If the cost of the total programme was now over  2,000 millions we should have to findsomething like  1,400 millions over the next three years.The Treasury estimated that on the basis of present rates of taxation we might manage to find  225 millions a year for Defence expenditure after meeting other charges, e.g0, interest on debt and civil expenditure.This estimate assumed a continuance of expenditure onthe social services at the present rate, b*&quot;t no increase.On the basis of this calculation we could find 675 millions from taxation on the existing basis duringthe next three years to meet a total defence expenditurein that period of  1,400 millions0     There was, therefore, 725 millions to be met either from borrowing and/or froman increase in taxation.     Assuming that this sum was found by borrowing (and he looked forward with great anxiety to any efforts to raise any substantial part ofthis vast sum by increased taxation), the total defenceborrowing over the quinquennium would be  178 millionsborrowed in the financial years 1937 and 1938:- plus 725 millions in April 1939 to March 1942,- i.e0* a totalof  903 millions to be borrowed over the period of fiveyears, as compared with  400 millions authorised inthe Defence Loans ActDThe real question was whether this task was within our powers,,     He invited attention to thestatement in paragraph 5 of the Appendix to cp.-247 (38), which, he thought,was a verymoderate statement of the results of excessive
borrowing.     It was quite certain that this enormoussum could not he provided out of the savings ofthis country.At the same time he did not suggest that purelyfinancial considerations should have priority overvital defence needs.     It was clear that we shouldhave to he prepared to face financial arrangements which we should not ordinarily contemplate astolerable.     It was, however, of vital importance thatwe should not get into a position whereby we undertooka very large programme, and announced our intentionof carrying it through, and then found that for financial reasons we were unable to do so.The Chancellor of the Exchequer also referred tothe cost of maintenance of the enlarged Air Force.There might be justification for borrowing in order tobuild up our forces, especially if the articlesprovided from borrowed money were likely to endurefor some time;    but he thought no-one would contemplate that we should borrow for the maintenance expenditureof the Defence forces.     He had asked the Air ministry to estimate the maintenance cost of the Air force on the basis of the revised Programme.     The figure had been tentatively put at  110 millions a year., which represented a large addition to previous estimates.He thought that this factor of maintenance costs was onewhich it was essential to bear in mind.
The Chancellor also referred to the difficulty which he had experienced in reconciling the verylarge figures of aeroplanes   already     orderedand which it was proposed to order under the new programme, with the figures of our first-line and reserve strength.       He understood that the explanation lay mainly in the very high v/astagerate, and in the number of machines required fortraining.Turning to paragraph 30 of C.P.-218 (38), theChancellor of the Exchequer said that the cost ofthe new Fighter programme there set out was  45millions, and the cost of the Bomber programme 175 millions.     These figures covered the costof the machines only and made no provision for maintenance charges.In regard to the proposal to concentrate onthe   construction of the very large bomber type,the Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that no single specimen of the types now proposed had flown.While he appreciated that these very big machineswould carry armour, nevertheless he felt that therewere important arguments both against and in favourof concentrating on heavy bombers.     This consideration had reinforced his view that it was desirable thatwe should lay special emphasis on priority for the fighter programme.   Such a programme was manifestlydefensive.     He therefore proposed that specialemphasis should be laid on the Fighter part of theprogramme, and that orders should be placed forthwithfor one-half of the total fighter programme.
as regards Bombers the Chancellor thought that&quot;-sufficient orders should be placed to avoid substantialdismissals in the aircraft factories concerned, and tosecure an adequate flow of production.     experience showed that unless contractors were assured of asufficient volume of follow-on orders, it was difficultto secure rapid completion of existing orders.Some of the shadow factories were not yet in full production, and it would be necessary to ensure thatthere was a normal complement of employment in thosefactorieso     For the time being, he thought that weshould proceed on this basis, and should not commit our-selves to the vast oxitlay involved by the whole of theheavy Bomber programme, which we might find it verydifficult to meet,As regards the 2,4-00 &quot;other types&quot; referred to inparagraph 52 of CP. 218(58), the Chancellor said thathe was not clear why proportional increases were requiredin Army co-operation machines and in the Fleet -air Arm.He thought that this demand might be examined by theSecretary of State for Air and himself in consultation.As regards the proposed increase in Overseas Squad-rons, he agreed with the Secretary of State for air thatthis matter might be remitted to the Committee of ImperialDefence.He thought that the Secretary of State for Air was right in the great importance which he attached to theprovision of jigs, tools and materials, with a view to increasing potential capacity.     He agreed that thestatement to be made in the House should include a refer-ence to the fact that steps were being talcen in thisdirection.The other proposals dealt v/ith in CP. 218(58)he thought could easily be adjusted between theSecretary of State for Air and himself.-21-
To sum up, the Chancellor&apos; of the Exchequer said thathis main point was that we should concentrate on the fighter programme.     As regards the Bombers he did not propose that the Cabinet should reach a conclusion which involved definite figures, but th at w e should authorisethe placing of orders from Bombers as quickly as might benecessary to keep the factories in full work.On the financial side he was by no means clearthat if we were to adopt the programme now proposed weshould get through without inflation.     This would meanrises in prices, in wages, and in interest rates, andmight well involve some real injury to our financial strength, which constituted a fourth arm of defence.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HOME AFFAIRS said thathe was much impressed with the statement made by theChancellor of the Exchequer.     He suggested that con-sideration might be given in the near future to thequestion whether the Opposition should be taken into theGovernment&apos;s confidence, as had been done in the years immediately preceding the Great War.Continuing, the Home Secretary said that he thought the programme could easily be explained to Germany, butthat it would not be easy to explain to the House of commons the real extent of the programme now proposed.     To give an example, the Secretary of State for Air proposed to saythat our first line Fighter strength, which everybody knewwas now about 30 or 40 Squadrons, woxxld be increased by30 per   cent.     This would not convey to anybody an order for 3,700 Fighters.   He asked whether it would not bepossible for the Secretary of State for Air to give somefigure outside the first-line strength.The Home Secretary also wondered whether theSecretary of State for AJ.r was not going rather too far in refraining from pvitting his goods in the shop window.     After all, one main purpose of the
Royal Air Force was to act as a deterrent, and therewas therefore much to be said for laying emphasis onthe impressive size and strength of our Air Force.Finally, the Rome Secretary referred to the scientific aspect of air warfare.     Much had been doneby the Air Defence Research Committee.     Air defence was now a matter of the utmost importance, and he thought that perhaps even more attention might be paid to this aspect of the matter.THE SECRETARY OF STATS FOR AIR referred to para-graph 38 of his Paper, in which reference was made toscientific research.     He said he would refer to thismatter in his statement in the House of Co:nmons0     Hehad already taken steps to strengthen the staff concernedwith scientific research.On the point of presentation, he thought that theHome Secretary had put his finger on the real diffi-culty.     He had considered whether there was any way,apart from expressing the programme in terms of money,of indicating that our real Fighter strength wouldbe increased many times by the programme now proposed.He was reluctant to disclose any figure of reserves,although he agreed that this argument was perhaps ofsomewhat less validity in regard to Fighters than inrelation to Bombers.     Another alternative would,of course, be to add to the first-line strength of fighters.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR thought  that it was amatter for consideration whether the position should be explained in somewhat more detail confidentially to theleaders of the Opposition parties and also to Mr. Churchill.
In regard to the manner of presentationthe Secretary of State for Air said that he did not feel that it would he enough to say that whereas the Air Estimates for the current year wore  120niillions, next year they would he  200 millions,since of that increase of  80 millions only  25 millions would he attributable to the proposals now underdiscuss ion0       He thought that if he was asked tostate how much of next year&apos;3 expenditure was dueto the new programme, he was bound to answer that question.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said that hewould find difficulty in agreeing to a statement ofthe programme in terms of money related to a periodfurther ahead than 1939-40. It would be disastrousif we announced that we intended to carry out a verylarge programme and later had to cancel part of theprogramme.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR, while appreciatingthis difficulty, repeated that he would be asked two questions:   first, how far the Government1s proposalsachieved parity with Germany;    and, secondly, whatv/as the cost of the new programme.     He thmight itwould be very difficxilt for him to answer the second question by saying that he was unable to give figures.After further discussion it was agreed that theterms of the statement to be made in the House ofCommons relating to the cost involved should be settled by the Prime Minister, the Chancellor of the Exchequer,the Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of State forAir, in consultation.
THE CHANCELLOR OP THE DUCHY OF LANCASTERobserved that his experience confirmed what the Secretaryof State for Air had said.    The Opposition were inpossession of information which would enable them to challenge any statement of the Government&apos;s programme which was not put forward with a considerable degree offrankness.THE MINISTER OF HEALTH referred to the particulars given in CP. 222 (38) as to the growth ofthe German aircraft industry.    He thought that thesefigures were very disquieting.   -We were now,  in fact, in asort of &quot;White War&quot;.    He did not think that the figurescomparing our production with production in Germany wouldbe easy to defend.    He wondered even now whether, thefigures of our own proposed production really represented the extent of the effort which this country ought to make.If we were unable to obtain parity, this would be the endof a long period of our history.    It might be necessarythat we should make a supreme effort in this directioneven if it meant borrowing  1,000 millions.    He pointedout that we were now in a period of falling prices.Further, we had one and a half million unemployed, which represented a potential source of untapped revenue ifthis labour source could be properly applied.    he appreciated, however, that it would be hard to get thisdone without a supreme effort and perhaps without seme radical change in the organisation of this country.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AI&amp; said that so faras he understood the matter, Germany was greatly helpedin paying for her armament programme by her export tradein arms which had given her the foreign exchange withwhich she paid for her imports of raw materials.
He enquired whether we ourselves could not again build up an export trade in armaments?THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that he had paid greatattention to the proposals put forward and the argumentsused in discussion, and he was in agreement with theviews stated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.     Hethought that we should take steps to obtain the necessary material, jigs and tools, etc., so as to be in a positionto carry out the full programme if need be.     It mightbe that Germany would be able to continue to increase her productive capacity, but he rather doubted whetherthis would prove the case.     He thought that we shouldbe most ill-advised to take the risks referred to bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer, until it was absolutely necessary that we should do so.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR said that he agreed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer that ifwe were involved in war, we must have sufficientfinancial strength to maintain ourselves.     We no longerpossessed the same financial assets as we had before theGreat War.     He thought that this consideration fully justified the adoption of the course proposed by theChancellor of the Exchequer.The new programme represented a very considerableeffort on our part.     He thought that the programmeneed give rise to no awkward repercussions in Germany;at the same time, if it could be properly presented, itshould and would satisfy public opinion in this country.
mTHE PRIME MINISTER agreed that there were difficulties about the question of presentation.     In our foreign policyv/e were doing our best to drive two horses abreast, con-ciliation and rearmament.     It was a very nice art to keepthese two steeds in step.     It was worth remembering thatit was not by any means certain that we could beat germany in an armament race.     Such a race was not merely aquestion of money, but also of industrial capacity and thelabour force;    in the latter respect Germany had theadvantage over us.As regards the proposal generally, he cordiallyagreed with the suggestion that our fighter strengthshould be increased.As regards our bomber strength, he thought it was rather difficult to represent this part of our force asin any way defensive.     Everyone would agree that wemust have bombers, but he thought it was undesirable to stress this side of the programme.The Prime Minister said that he thought lie must saythat he felt very uneasy about the proposal that weshould concentrate on the type of very heavy bomber nowproposed.     He agreed with the Secretary of State for Airthat there v/ere weighty reasons in favour of starting this new type which would be extremely formidable.     The PrimeMinister recalled, however, the satisfaction which hadgreeted the first building of &quot;Dreadnoughts1 by thiscountry.     It had been thought that by starting this new type of battleship v/e were gaining an advantage over allthe other maritime Powers,,     Before long, however, othercountries had started to build Dreadnoughts, and v/e had then been forced to rebuild the whole of our Battle Fleet. The
result had been that the whole level of naval armaments and of their cost had been raised,.     He could not helpwondering whether the proposal that we should concentrate on the building of Manchesters and Halifaxes would not result in Germany producing a super Halifax..The Prime Minister agreed that this was not amatter which could be settled by laymen, but he felt boundto express his uneasiness in regard to it, and he hopedthat the Secretary of btate would give further consideration&apos;to the problem &quot;before deciding which was the right course to adopt.The Prime Minister said that he noted that one of theseheavy &quot;bombers cost as much as four fighters.     He agreedthat concentration on the. heavy type meant economy increws and so forth.     Nevertheless, the loss of one ofthese machines would represent a far more formidable blowthan the loss of a smaller machine.,     He could not helpfeeling that it would be more difficult to grass the wholecovey of small birds than to bring down one large birdoTHE SECRETARY - OP STATE FOR AIR undertook to re-examine the problem afresh in the light of the discussion.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY pointed out that if qualitativelimitation of armaments was obtained, a start wouldprobably be made by banning these very large bombers.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE saidthat no doubt they all felt the difficulty referred toby the Minister of Health as to presentation in Parliament.Surely, however, the real point was what was the rightpolicy for this country?     For his part, he did notthink it was the right policy that we should try to match
Germany machine by machine.     He invited attention      ^statement in paragraph 15 of CP. 218(38), in which itv/as stated that "to  achieve equality in air strikingpower with Germany means that our striking force must be capable of delivering at least an equal load of bombs atthe required range&quot;.     speaking as a layman, the ministers aid that he disputed this statement.     He thought thatif we v/ere in a position to deliver an attack on germany in sufficient strength to create a deterrent effect, it did not follow that any increase in German strength mustnecessarily be followed by an increase in our own strength.The Minister also emphasised the importance in his viewof the proposal in regard to jigs, tools and materials.This was a point which had been emphasised by all the experts.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR said that the AirStaff reply to the point made by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence was, he thought, that this argumentv/ould    be     sound, provided we had sufficient fighterstrength;   but at the moment this v/as not the case.     he hoped the Cabinet would reach agreement as the result ofthe present discussion.     It was clearly understood thatit would be open to the Chancellor of the Exchequer orthe Foreign Secretary to come to the Cabinet at any&quot; timeand say that the programme must be reviewed/ed in the lightof the financial situation or that it was no longer necessary by reason of the betterment of the international situation.The Cabinet&apos;s decisions in regard to the Air programme are set out in detail at the end of this Minute.
THE HOME SECRETARY, referring to paragraph 24 of CP. 247 (38), said that certain questions were referred to which would involve legislation.     He thought it would he better to dealwith these proposals when the proposed Air RaidPrecautions Bill had been prepared.     For the rest,he thought that while the proposals erred, if anything, on the side of moderation, the cabinet should accept them, subject to further considerationby the Lord Privy SealoTHE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that he was inagreement with the proposals generally, but on oneox* two minor matters he might desire to suggest some modification.Reference was made to the proposal inparagraph 24 (4) as to the provision of blast-proofshelters in existing buildings.     There was some discussion as to the extent to which this proposalcovered private houses.     It was agreed that thismatter should be examined when the Bill was indraft.The Cabinet agreed to approve the proposals&apos;in paragraph 24 of CP. 247 (38) relative to air raid Precautions, subject to any modifications whichthe Lord Privy Seal might think necessary or desirable to bring before the Cabinet.
