DEATH OF 1.      THE PRIME MINISTER said that since theLORD STANLEY.Cabinet had last mot they had lost one of their colleagues.    He was sure that all or them sharedhis deep sense of the loss which they had sustained by the untimely death of Lord Stanley,  at thebeginning of what he felt sure would have been abrilliant period of office as Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs,The Prime Minister thought that hiscolleagues would v/ish him to express their sorrowto Lord Stanley&apos;s brother, who was also theircolleague, and to Lord Stanley&apos;s family.The Cabinet invited the Prime Ministerto send on their behalf to Lord Stanley&apos;sfamily an appropriate message expressing their deep regret and sympathy.

THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSCzechoslovakia.Save the Cabinet a summary of recent developments in regard to a number of matters affectingCzechoslovakia.The Foreign Secretary said that furtherconsideration had boeti gfven. -fto the question ofthe Guarantee.    A Paper on this subject had beenprepared and would shortly be submitted eitherdirect to the Cabinet or to the Foreign Policy&apos; Committee.Refugees.    The position of refugees fromthe ceded areas had been exciting interest amonga number of bodies.    Broadly speaking, however,most of the suggestions put forward by these bodies had already been acted upon.As regards The Lord Mayor&apos;s Fund therewas a Committee working in Prague under the presidency of the British Minister and under the Chairmanship ofSir Vv. Erskine, lately our Ambassador at Warsaw.This local Committee examined applications from various organisations, and sent them to the lord mayor with requests for a grant.    The foreign secretary thought that the Lord Mayor had not as yetmade adequate arrangements for deciding as betweenthe various proposals which might be submitted tohim for helping refugees from his Fund.    after consulting Sir Warren Fisher he had suggested to theLord Mayor that he should enlist the aid of SirCampbell Stuart in dealing with this problem.On more general matters the international commission at Berlin had decided upon the lineof the German occupation..   Both in regard to thework of the International Commission and to theoccupation of the areas up to the line, our
observers had done useful work.    As a matter of direct discussion between the German andCzechoslovak Governments a decision had been reached by the two Governments that there should be noplebiscites.    The representatives of the twoGovernments were now at work on minor adjustments of the frontier.    The decision to dispense withplebiscites,  incidentally, relieved us of theresponsibility for sending out the British Legionto police the plebiscite areas.    There was little doubt that the Czechoslovak Government would haveto come to terms with Germany on both economicand political matters.As regards Relations between czechoslovakia and Poland, the Polish troops had occupied tv/odistricts and had asked for a plebiscite in a third district.    This latter demand, however, hadbeen abandoned in consideration for the cessionto Poland of a small part of the proposed plebiscitearea..    Even so, the Poles had obtained rather moreterritory than was justified on ethnographicalgrounds.Relations between Hungary and Czechoslovakia-The negotiations between the two countries had nowbeen resumed, but the difference between the two sides was still large.    It remained to be seen whether the influence of Germany and Italy wouldresult in an accommodation.The Foreign Secretary mentioned that onFriday of the preceding week he had received a message from the Italian Embassy that signor mussolini regarded the position between hungary and Czechoslovakia as very serious, and suggested the summoning of a Four-Power Conference.In   a   later   message   this   suggestion-3-
had been abandoned.     This was, perhaps, a slightindication that Germany and Italy had not acted incomplete accord in this natter.Financial representatives of Czechoslovakia hadbeen in this country discussing natters with representa-tives of the Treasury, and it had been explained to themthat the primary object of the  10 millions which had beenput at the disposal of the Czechoslovak Government wasthe relief of refugees.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that he had re-ceived a letter from the chiof Czechoslovak representativewho had indicated that the total sum required by Czecho-slovakia might amount to a very large figure.     A sum of 120 millions or  130 millions was mentioned, coveringsuch objects as the diversion of roads and railways.The immediate concern was to see that the czechoslovak government had means to deal with the refugees now coming in from the ceded territories.   A letter had been written to explain that the  10 millions had been put at the dis-posal of the Czechoslovak Government primarily for thepurpose of relieving refugees.     It had been stipulated that there must be no discrimination in the use of this money on grounds of politics or race.     The Czechoslovakrepresentative had agreed that he would only draw uponthe  10 millions as and when necessary, and that the.balance v/ould remain here in sterling.     The Czechoslovakrepresentative had expressed himself      satisfied withthe position.The Chancellor added that he was not yet in aposition to say whether it would be necessary to makewider proposals to Parliament for helping Czechoslovakia.On this point it would be necessary to consult with theFrench Government.
REFUGEES. 3*     In connection with the precedingPrevious discussion,  the CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OFReference:Cabinet 33 (38)       LANCASTER reminded his colleagues that he wasConclusion 4.)Chairman of an Inter-Governmental Committee dealingwith, the refugee question, of which the Director wasa U.S.Ao citizen who was a personal friend of president Roosevelto     Even before the Czechoslovakcrisis, it had been difficult to take any adequatesteps to deal with the 600,000 persons who it wasthen estimated would be refugees from Germany and austria.      The position was likely to be renderedmore difficult by the attention now being given torefugees from the Sudeten German areas.     TheChancellor of the Duchy expressed the hope thatthis aspect of the matter v/ould not be lost sight of, since otherwise there was some danger that weshould find ourselves in controversy with theAmerican Government.In the course of discussion, theSECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES gave certain information as to the limited possibilities of settling refugees in the Colonies.     He explainedthat he had also been in touch with the DominionHigh Commissioners on the matter.     broadly speaking, he thought that the Dominions would beready to help when definite proposals could be furnished to them, but they were averse from unduepublicity, which would make matters difficult forthem.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTERpointed out that the U.S.A* representatives on theInter-Governmental Committee were making play
with the fact that whereas they had offered to take2^,000 refugees (which was not in itself at all a generous response), this country had not so far agreedto receive any definite number of refugees,THE PRIME MINISTER thought that it was notpossible for the time being to carry this matter anyfurther, and suggested that his colleagues should take note of the Chancellor of the Duchy&apos;s statement.u 6 &quot;
PRANCE.external andinternalfolicy.previous reference:$cabinet 47 (38))4.      THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGNAFFAIRS gave his colleagues certain impressions ofthe position in France which he had received fromHis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Paris.     There had been no recriminations in Paris against this countryand there had been no great reaction against theFrench Prime Minister.     The French government proposed to reconsider their Polish and RussianTreaties v/ith a view to making the bringing intoforce of France&apos;s commitments under those Treatiesless automatic and so to allow France more room for manoeuvre.     Sir Eric Phipps thought that oneresult would be that France would adopt a moredefensive position and would tend to rely more upon this country.     There was some pressure for aGeneral Election in France, and it seemed not unlikely that there would be an election,notwithstanding some opposition from the french president.

financial ANDI EASTERN*E.in Economicjraticn.ri ousjrence:.net 28(58),clusion l)e7.      THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that in the last two weeks suggestions and demandshad poured in from every quarter.     The &quot;burden of allthese suggestions had been that unless His Majesty&apos;sGovernment could find large suras of money to financesome transaction,this or that Balkan country would fall under the domination of Germany.The Foreign Secretary said that he would dealseparately with the particular case of Roumanian wheat.As regards the general issue, he had come to theconclusion that it v/as impossible for the Foreign Officeto reach a proper conclusion on individual cases0     Thematter must be looked at as a whole.     It v/ould have tobe determined what action it v/as within our powersto take, and in what direction such action should betaken, and the probable effect of such action on ourrelations with Germany.     The Foreign Secretarytherefore proposed to submit to the Cabinet a paper, whichwas now in course of preparation, dealing with theproblem as a whole.
plANIAN 8.      TliE SECRETARY OF&apos; STATS FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSEAT.I- summarised the main points set out in a paper whichrchase of.he had circulated (CP. 226 (38)) &quot;being an extractpevioussference: from the draft Conclusions of a Meeting of the Cabinetabinct 28(3G)oncluaion l).      Committee on Trade and Agriculture, held on 15thOctober.     At this meeting the Cabinet Committee had examined a proposal by the Secretary of State that theFood (Defence Plans) Department should turn over partof the wheat it had already bought for storage and shouldbuy 200,000 tons of Roumanian   wheat in place of it.He (the Secretary of State) had urged that it wasnecessary to take some immediate action to show our interest in Rounania   before the arrival in thatcountry of Herr Funk, the   German Kinister of Economics.The proposal to buy 200,000 tons of Roumanian wheat wasnot perhaps verjr much in itself.     Lord Lloyd had thoughtthat we should buy 600,000 tons.      Nevertheless, theaction proposed had a certain symbolic value and mightoperate to steady the position for the time being.Continuing, the Foreign Secretary said thatthe Chancellor of the Exchequer and the President of theBoard of Trade had raised objections to the proposal from a departmental point of view, but had been preparedto agree to it on grounds of policy.     In view of the urgency of a settlement of this question, the CabinetCommittee had reached the following conclusions:-(l) To take note that the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs would submit ..the casefully to the Prime Minister in a letter to be despatched forthwith:(2) That, subject to the Prime Minister1s approval,and in anticipation of Cabinet authority, thePresident of the Board of Trade should beauthorised to proceed with the purchase of200,000 tons of Roumanian wheat in replacement of wheat already held in store by the Food(Defence Plans) Department:
(3) That the Secretary of State for Foreign/JTfairs should report the action talcen tothe Cabinet at their Meeting on Wednesday,19th October.The matter had been referred to the PrimeMinister who had concurred in the action proposed andthe President of the Board of Trade was now conductingnegotiations for the purchase of 200,000 tons of roumanian &quot;&quot;heat.THE PRESIDENT OP THE 30ARD OP TRADE said thathe wished to emphasise that this was a matter of generalpolicy and   ot a departmental measure.     J-e had agreed tothe proposal because he recognised that if this transaction-tion was to be carried out at all, it could only bo doneP p..^7cj^)i2-.through the agency of the Pood (Defence Plans) Department.He hoped, however, that this action would not be a pre-cedent for future transactions of a like nature.     Thesum at the disposal of the Pood (Defence Plans) Depart-ment was none too large and he could not agree to its being used for extraneous purposes.The President of the Board of Trade also emphasised that the millers had been extremely helpful in thismatter and he hoped that he might have authority toexplain to some of the leaders of the grain trade in confidence the reasons for the action which we had talcen.He thought that this was important in order to obtain theconfidence of the trade.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCEhoped that it would be impressed upon the roumanian government that the action which we had talcen in thismatter had been talcen at great inconvenience to our &quot;own arrangements..
The Cabinet agreed -(1) To approve the action which had alreadybeen taken and to authorise the Presidentof the lioard of Trade to concludenegotiations for the purchase of 200,000tons of Roumanian wheat, in replacement of        wheat already held in store bythe Pood (Defence Plans) Department..-(2) To authorise the President of the Boardof Trade to explain the reasons for theaction taken in confidence to some ofthe leaders of the grain trade.
 TED-KINGDON        9.    The Cabinet had under consideration a ReportjjJITED STATESIfcuE NEGOTIA- by the Committee on Trade and Agriculture (CoPo-225X)NS.  (38)) on the subject of the United-Kingdom - Unitedport by:binet States Trade Agreement.    The Committee had examined ainraittee.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Tradefrevious (T.A.C. (36) 55, attached as Appendix T to the Report)tef erence:cabinet 36       dealing with the latest American consolidated listB38), Con-elusion 3.)     of requests, and telegram Mo. 369, dated 9th October,from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington (AppendixIT) expressing the viev that it would be unwise to face a breakdown of the negotiations on these demands.At the end       their Report the Committee summarisedtheir Conclusions as follows :-&quot;(i) The main question of policy, whether weshould now give the Americans our finaloffer and be prepared to break off nego-tiations for a Trade Agreement if thatoffer is not accepted, is reserved forconsideration by the Cabinet(ii)  If the Ca-binet decide in favour of a finaloffer being now made, we recommend thatthat offer should deal with the latestAmerican consolidated list of requests asfollows :-(a) Maize:    the request for eonventional-isation of free entry should be granted,(b) Lard:    if absolutely necessary, and. ifFF7?.^r*S^3$) 11.   we are assured that it will clinch the bargain, this request for free entryshould be granted-( c) Toba.(ccoI   we should, as proposed by thePresident of the Board of Trade, offer a formula which it is hoped that the americans will accept0(d) The other requests concerning items ofimportance, namely, hams, wheat flour,planed softwood, plywood and motor-cars,should be refused, as should also the requests in regard to items of minor importance, i.e., electric motors,typewriters and silk stockings.&quot;
THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER in introducing the Report emphasised that the main question for his colleagues was whether we should now make a final offer to the American Government.     Heset out the position in regard to the chief items inthe    American consolidated list of requests, and explained the reasons for the recommendations madeby the Cabinet Committee as set out in the Committee*sReport.In regard to hams,  the concession now asked for was inconsistent with the policy which wehad adopted in this country &quot;of enabling the &quot;baconindustry to become independent of direct Treas-ucysupport by the end of three years while remainingprotected by a regulation of imports.     He thought the American demand must be rejected.In regard to planed soft wood and ply wood,the benefit to U.S.A. trade of the concessions askedfor was infinitesimal as compared with the cost tothis country of the concessions proposed.While he agreed that it would he a misfortune ifwere unable to conclude a treaty, there was a limit tothe demands which we. could concede.     It wasimpossible to say that the treaty, as it now stood, wasone which on balance would be approved by the commercialcommunity.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE said thathe was in agreement with the views expressed by theChancellor of the Exchequer.     He thought that we shouldmake up our minds now as to how far we should go and should refuse to make any further concessions.     He was confirmed in this view by discussions which he had had with theAmerican Ambassador,
Turning to the individual demands,most of the minor ones were obviously put forward,not on their merits, but as the result of intriguesby interested parties.      He thought that theseminor demands should be rejected.      It might, however,be possible to find a form of words which   couldbe embodied in an agreed Minute, and which would help the United State of America in regard tosilk stockings, without any breach of the principlethat we should keep our hands free to make further increases in duties if we so desired.As regards tobacco, he v/as clear that theUnited States were trying to get us to agree to a form of words which would put us under a moral obligation in respect of the period after 1942.We must be careful to avoid putting ourselves in this position, although there v/as no objection to a formula which provided for consultation in 1942,if such a formula would have some face-savingvalue to the Americans.The President of tho Board of Trade saidthat he did not think the United States Governmentwould accept the proposals framed by the CabinetCommittee as a final offer.     He thought that,if the Cabinet felt that some further concession should be made in order to ensure agreement,a concession should be made in regard to hams,notwithstanding the difficulties involved.In his view, if we broke with the Americans
on hams, the position would not he altogether easy to explain to the country.     The Treaty could hedenounced after three years, and in theory,therefore, it might not seem to he essential to insist upon the insertion of the time limit in the quantitative guarantee for hams.Continuing, the President of the Board ofTrade said that the best chance of reaching asettlement lay in asking the American Ambassador inLondon to communicate our first offer to Mr.Cordell Hull direct. The American ambassador was willing and anxious to be helpful, but we should put him in a false position if we communicatedsomething to him which purported to be our last word,and at a later stage made some further concession.The President also thought that, before thenegotiations were finally concluded a personal appeal would be made to the Prime Minister, and he thoughtthat there was much to be said for reserving somefinal concession which we could offer when this appealwas made to the Prime Minister.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that   his general feeling was that it was desirable to go a very longway in order to reach an Agreement.     Nevertheless,he was convinced that it was impossible to make concessions in regard to some of the requests putforward by the Americans.     He asked whether the
tobacco formula could be made somewhatmore forthcoming, without going so far as to involve any moral obligation, and whether anything could be done in regard to motor carsby price differentiation.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had talcengreat interest in these negotiations and muchhoped that we should reach an Agreement.      Hehad never hoped that we should obtain any great economic or political support fromthe United States as a result of making thisAgreement.      The advantages to be derivedwere of a somewhat negative kind.      It was clear that if after months of negotiationsno Agreement was reached, hard things wouldbe said.      This, however, was a factor whichmust appeal to Mr.  Cordell Hull also.     Hewas in favour of sending a reply to theAmerican Government on the lines of thereport of the Cabinet Committee.     He thoughtthat they should wait and see whether an appeal would be made to the Prime Minister before considering whether any further concessionscould be made.THE MINISTER OP AGRICULTURE ANDFISHERIES said that he had tried not to takea purely departmental view in regard to these negotiations, and had agreed to a number of concessions which would be likely to be disadvantageous to the agricultural community.
The proposal to remove the time limit inregard to the guaranteed minimum of 5009000 cwts0of hams which might be imported f i om Americaignored entirely the fact that our domestic policyv/as based on a three-year period,     V/e could nottie our hands as to what we should do after three years.     If we left the curing industry inuncertainty as to what should happen after threeyears, their confidence would be underminedsand this would be likely to hinder the effectiverationalisation of the curing industry.The Minister said that he had been thinkingwhether further steps should be taken-     One possibleline would be that if the three-year limit &quot;/ereretained in Schedule Iy an exchange of notesmight be appended toUie Agreement stating thatif9  after three years., the U.K. Governmentfound it necessarys for the efficient operationof the bacon industry s to reduce the quota on hamsbelow 500s000 cwtSeg they would not do so without first consulting the United States Government with aview to the compensatory modification of the concessions to U,K. products set out in Schedule iv of the Agreement9 or alternatively an addition tothe concessions granted to United States products in Schedule I.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER thought thatwe should now put forward a statement of our final offer which would not include any concessionas regards hamss but should include a concession on lard if this would clinch the negotiations,,
TIIE PRIME MINISTER said that he was in agreementwith this course0     He thought that it would be necessary  that the President of the Board of Trade, whenexplaining our offer to the American Ambassador, should press aa strongly as possible our case against making any further concessions in regard to the outstandingitems, including tobacco.     He thought that it was unlikely that Mr. Cordell Hull would be prepared to face an immediate break, and that the response to ourcommunication through the American Ambassador might heto the effect that if Mr. Kennedy could secure some further concession, the Americans would agree to conclude a Treatye     If this situation arose, it would then be right to consider whether we should make such a further concession.The Cabinet agreed:-(l) That a statement of our final offer to the americans should now he made on the &quot;basisset o^^t in the Conclusions reached by theCabinet Committee, vis:-(a) Maize:     the request for conventionalisa-tion &quot;of free entry should be granted.(b) Lard:    if absolutely necessary, and ifPR stl^^i?-     we  re assumed^e(3- that it will clinch the bargain, this request for free entryshould he granted.(c) Tobacco.:    we should, as proposed bythe President of the Board of Trade,offer a formula which it is hoped thatthe Americans will accept,,(d) the other requests concerning items ofimportance, namely, hams, wheat,  flour,planed softwood, plywood and motor-cars,should he refused as should also the requests in regard to items of minor importance, i.e0, electric motors,typewriters and silk stockings,,(2)    That the President of the Board of trade should be authorised to transmit this offerthrough the American Ambassador.
(3)    That if an appeal was made to thePrime Minister for some further concession in order to avoid a break in negotiations, the matter should befurther considered by the Cabinet.
DEFENCE PRE- 11. The Cabinet had before the1- a Most SecretPARATIONS.  Memorandum by the Minister -&quot;or Co-ordination of measures ofAcceleration. Defence ^CP.-219 (38)) acquainting his colleagues(previous reference:Cabinet 48(38), Con-clusion 5 .)with the steps being taken to deal with the all-important matter of Defence Preparations and Measuresof Acceleration.At the 333rd Meeting of the Committee of Imperial( This date wassubsequentlyadvanced to25th October.), jX   ., Defence, held on the 6th October, it was agreed:-&quot;(a)  That all Departments concerned should carryout forthwith m revie1&quot; of the military and civil defence measures taken during therecent crisis, and should submit a report thereon as soon as possible (and in any event not later than the 31st October )to the Secretary, Committee of ImperialDefence, for consideration by the Ministerfor Co-ordination of Defence.(b) That- the above reports should -(i) point, out any defects in existingar rang events which were disclosedduring the crisis:    and.(ii) make suggestions for remedying thesedefects o( c) That the Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence should consult with the other ministers  concerned in regard to theprocedure for dealing with the reports.( d)  In addition to the above review of theparticular- defence measures taken duringthe crisis, to invite the Minister forCo-ordination of defence to consult withthe Ministers  concerned, in regard to any changes in defence policy which are now considered necessary.&quot;On the same date the Minister had invited the three service Departments to submit by the 18th Octoberstatements showing the following particulars:-(i) To what extent the approved programmes would. ha.ve been completed by the 1stAugust, 1939, giving details under anumber of heads:( ii) What steps could be taken to improve theabove position by the 1st August, 1939,or shortly thereafter, a.nr&quot;- what thosesteps would involve.As soon as these reports were received, the minister proposed to consider th&apos;- matter further with the
Service Ministers, v/ith a view to submitting definite proposals at an early date as to the steps to betaken to accelerate defence preparations.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE,after summarising the main points in his Memorandum,said that he proposed to consult with the PrimeMinister and his Defence colleagues before the25th October, when the reports called for by theCommittee of Imperial Defence would be received, as tothe most appropriate machinery for dealing v/ith them.As regards the Supply side of the picturehe proposed to consider this matter v/ith the service ministers, with a view to submitting a Report to theCabinet.     His present view was that the only way ofobtaining more equipment by the 1st August, 1939,would be by a somewhat drastic use of compulsory powers.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HOME AFFAIRS saidthat he thought that it would be necessary that these reports should be dealt with by some body able to sitfrom day to day.     He suggested that the Defence Policyand Requirements Committee should be reconstituted forthe purpose.After some further discussion the cabinet agreed:(1)   That it should be left to the PrimeMinister, in consultation with hiscolleagues, to settle the procedure for dealing with these Reports.(2) That if any big change was involved the matter should be brought beforethe Cabinet.

The Cabinet had under consideration a Memo-randum by the Secretary of State for Air (C*P.-224(38)) reporting that the Air Mission to Canada, whosedespatch was approved at the Meeting mentioned in the margin, had succeeded in negotiating a scheme for thecreation of a potential for aircraft production inCanada which would be capable of being graduallydeveloped in war to a capacity of 500 large bomber aircraft per annum.   After commenting on the aspectsof the Mission&apos;p Report which required cabinet authority, the Secretary of State summed up his proposals as follows(l) That an educational order for 80 Hampdenaircraft, at an approximate cost of 1,300,000 should be placed with theCanadian aircraft industry, coupled with the execution of an agreement forthe effective maintenance and develop-ment over a period of 10 years of the manufacturing capacity so created.(2) That this action should, be taken withoutany attempt at the present time to secure an assurance from the Canadian Governmentthat the productive capacity thus  created,would certainly be available to thiscountry in war.(3) That orders for a maximum of 40 fighter aircraft and 20 general reconnaissance aircraft (or equivalent types) (at an approximate cost of  500,000) should beplaced with firms in Western Canada.(4) That an Air Ministry engine expert shouldbe sent to explore the possibilities of a group Scheme on a modest scale for pro-ducins aero-engines in Canada, but withoutin any way committing His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment.
THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR explainedthat the Report of the Air Mission gave effect to ascheme which had already been approved in principle.He paid a tribute to Sir Hardman Lever who had headedthe Mission.     He pointed out that the suggestion made when the matter was previously discussed, namely, thatit v/ould be advisable to place an educational order inthe first instance, had been adopted.     This was essentially a long-term scheme, and it would be rashto assume that we should derive any benefit from itin the near future.After a short discussion, the cabinet agreed:To approve the proposals submitted bythe Secretary of State in CP. 224 (38)and quoted above.
AIRCRAFT ANDBOMBARDMENTRISKS *(previous reference:Cabinet 18 (37)Conclusion 3)13*     The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence(CP. 223 (38)) circulating the Report of theSub-Committee on Aircraft and Bombardment Risks(C.I.D. Paper No. 1467-B) and the relevant extractfrom the 333rd Meeting of the Committee of ImperialDefence, at which the Report had been considered.After summarising the conclusions reached by theSub-Committee, the Minister stated in his memorandum that the Committee of Imperial Defencerecommended that the proposals contained in theReport should be endorsed by the Cabinet, and thatthe Cabinet should approve the detailed recommendations set out in Conclusion (a) of the extract from their 333rd Meeting.     The fullConclusions of the Committee of Imperial Defence are reproduced as an Appendix to these Minutes.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCEdrew attention to the main points in the Report as summarised in his Memorandum.     He pointed out thatthe underlying hypothesis on which the Report was based had already been stated to Parliament, namely,that it was impossible to frame a scheme of insurance for property in this country against war risks on land appropriate to the conditions of a future war.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER called attention to Conclusion 3 (b) of the 333rd Meetingof the Committee of Imperial Defence, namely, thatif possible an announcement in regard to compensation to property owners should be linked up with the question of compensation to civilians for loss of life or injury from air attack.
General agreement was expressed as to thedesirability of making an announcement simultaneously in regard to both subjects, if possible at an earlydate.THE PRIME MINISTER invited the Minister ofHealth to preside over the Committee referred to inConclusion 3 (a) (v), and said that he would consultfurther with the Minister of Health in regard to the membership of the Committee.The Cabinet agreed:(a) To approve the Conclusions of theCommittee of Imperial Defence asset out in the Appendix to these minutes;(b) To take note that the Minister ofHealth would act as the Chairmanof the Committee recommended inConclusion 3 (a) (v), and that thePrime Minister would consult further with the Minister of Health in regardto the membership of the Committee..
P3JG&apos;S SPEECHES 14.     THE PRIME MINISTER proposed that, followingPROROGATIONfciP OPENING OF normal practice, a Committee should be set up toTifflilAMENT.draft the King!s speeches on the Prorogation andRf.-S&quot;0L3^)y -     Opening of Parliament.He proposed that the Committee should be composed as follows:-The Prime Minister.The Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Lord Chancellor.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.The Secretary of State for the home department.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.The Minister of Labour.In addition, the Committee would have discretion to invite other Ministers to attend their meetings,in order to assist them in dealing with particularmatters.This course was agreed to.
15.     The Cabinet had under consideration aMemorandum &quot;by the President of the Board of Trade(CP. 216 (58)) on the subject of Insurance Legislation,in which he sought authority to prepare a Bill, with aview to introduction next Session, designed to bring upto date, and to remedy certain defects in, the AssuranceCompanies Act, 1909, on lines described in his Memorandum.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRaDE said that this   was a complicated matter, but it was non-contentious sofar as party politics was concerned, and he thoughthe had secured the agreement of the interests concerned.There was some urgency in the matter, since hewas not altogether satisfied with the position ofone or two Companies who were engagsd in compulsory insurance.     If anything happened to these Companies,the Government would be criticised for not havingintroduced legislation at an earlier date.The President of the Board of Trade suggested thatthe Home Affairs Committee should be given authoritywhen the Bill came before thom to deal, not only withdrafting matters, but with issues of policy arising upon it.THE LORD CHANCELLOR agreed with the view that thiswas a matter which should be dealt with urgently.The Cabinet agreed -(l)   To authorise the President of the Boardof Trade to prepare a Bill on thelines indicated in his Memorandum(CP. 216(58)) with a view to its introduction next session.(2)   That the Home Affairs Committee shouldhave authority when considering this bill to deal not only with draftingquestions but also with questions ofpolicy0

APPENDIX.Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   October 1938.SECRET.COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Extract from the Minutes of the 333n/ Meeting, held on October 6. 1938.******(3) AIRCRAFT AND BOMBARDMENT RISKS.(C.I.D. Paper No. 1467-B.)(Previous Reference: C.I.D. Minutes of the 292nd Meeting, Minute 1.)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration the Report of a Sub-Committeeon Aircraft and Bombardment Risks (C.I.D. Paper No. 1467-B).SIR JOHN SIMON said that the Report had been drawn up by a strongSub-Committee which had reached unanimous conclusions. He suggested that,broadly speaking, the Committee of Imperial Defence should accept these conclusions. There were two main points, however, to which he wished to drawspecial attention. The first was that, owing to the incalculable nature of the risks involved in damage to property by aircraft bombardment, it was impossibleto devise a system of insurance which would cover these risks. It was an uninsur-able proposition. The only feasible plan was to attempt a scheme of partialcompensation by which the financial resources of the State could be applied atthe end of hostilities in accordance with the extent of damage incurred and theamount of money which was available. The necessity for postponing such compensation until the end of the war was due to the obvious fact that no payment could be made until the full bill was known. To arrive at this knowledge,however, it was necessary to have a machine which would be ready to measure the damage from the moment when it began to occur. The recommendation in theReport, with which he agreed, was that this machine should be set up now by theBoard of Inland Revenue. The second point arose out of the announcement which would have to be made on this subject in Parliament. The recent crisishad produced a pressing demand that an announcement should be made withoutdelay, and he had promised this at an early date. Such an announcement, how-ever, raised the very important political issue of the need for a correspondingannouncement about the intentions of the Government to pay compensation for human injuries and loss of life. Claims would inevitably be preferred by persons who had been injured and by the relations of those who had been killed.It was therefore essential that any announcement regarding the intention of theGovernment to provide compensation for damage should be accompanied by asimilar announcement regarding compensation for human injury and loss of life.SIR THOMAS INSKIP pointed out that the question of compensation to civilians for loss of life or injury from air attack had already been examined bya Sub-Committee whose Report* had been taken by the Committee of ImperialDefence on the 15th July, 1937.t The scheme recommended by this Sub-Committeehad been approved both by the Committee of Imperial Defence and by theCabinet,! and the Ministry of Pensions had been entrusted with the task ofworking out the necessary details, g* G.I.D. Paper No. 257-A.f C.I.D./297th Meeting, Minute 5.i Cabinet 37 (87), Conclusion 12.g Note : The Conclusions of the C.T.D. on this subject are attached as an Annex to-these Minutes.[18034-3]
SIR SAMUEL HOARE suggested that the announcement regarding theintention to pay compensation for damage should be qualified by a statement thatsuch compensation would entail an obligation on certain property holders toprovide air raid precautions.SIR KINGSLEY WOOD thought that, whereas this might be possible inregard to new houses, it would be difficult to apply in the case of existing buildings.Mr. WALTER ELLIOT pointed out that difficulties would be encounteredeven in respect of new buildings, particularly those which were being built underthe Government Housing Scheme. Here it was very desirable to avoid measureswhich would raise the cost of these new houses, such as the provision of cellarsor structural alterations for air raid precautions. The result of this policy mightbe to reverse the present tendency for houses to be built each with a small gardenin which trenches could be dug for protection against air attack.Mr. STANLEY saw the force of Mr. Elliot&apos;s arguments with regard todwelling-houses, but considered that it would be perfectly reasonable to demand that owners of big blocks of commercial and industrial buildings should provideair raid precautions as a quid pro quo for such compensation as they might expect to receive for their damage in the event of war.SIR JOHN SIMON agreed, pointing out that this could be regarded asbeing on a par with the precautions which householders were already required totake against the risks of fire by the provision of fire-escape staircases.SIR KINGSLEY WOOD suggested that the question of making thecompensation which would be paid for damage in war conditional on the provisionof air raid precautions in buildings was a matter which might conveniently beconsidered by the proposed Ministerial Sub-Committee mentioned in the final paragraph of the Report.Mr. STANLEY said that, while he agreed in general with the recommenda-tions of the Report, he felt it necessary to emphasise that the announcement of adecision to postpone compensation until the end of hostilities would probablyresult in an immediate and unfortunate diminution in certain industrial stocks.Whilst it would no doubt be possible to counteract this contingency in respect of commodities over which the Government would assume control in war. e.(f., food,by taking the commercial interests concerned into the confidence of the Govern-ment, he was gravely apprehensive that there would be an immediate reactiontowards reducing stocks of commodities outside Government Control Schemes.SIR FREDERICK PHILLIPS pointed out that this point had been given careful consideration by the Sub-Committee in paragraph 9, and that the irrecommendation (in paragraph 27) was that the Board of Trade should give early consideration to the possibility of exceptional provision for the maintenance oftrade in commodities outside the Government Control Schemes. Continuing, hesaid that the Uthwatt Committee, which had been appointed by the LordChancellor, had now reported on the questions which had been referred to it,namely, the modifications of financial obligations secured on property whichbecomes damaged by aircraft (paragraph 10 of the Report), and the relief of tenants from their obligations under leases to repair damaged property(paragraph 11 of the Report), and suggested that the Report of the UthwattCommittee should be taken into consideration by the proposed ministerial committee.Conclusions.The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed : -(a) To recommend to the Cabinet that the proposals contained in the Reportof the Sub-Committee on Aircraft and Bombardment Risks (C.I.D.Paper No. 1467-B) should be endorsed by the Cabinet, and that theCabinet should, in particular, approve : -(i) the general principle that in the case of a major war nothing more can be attempted than a scheme of partial compensationat the end of hostilities (paragraph 6 of the Report).

Paper No. 257-A and C.I.D. Minutes of the 297th Meeting,Minute 5), and approved by the Cabinet (Cabinet 37 (37), Conclu-sion 12) in regard to the question of the compensation to civilians for loss of life or injury from air attack, with a view to the preparationof a public announcement covering both these matters.(c) That the Report of the Uthwatt &quot;Committee on the question of the modification of financial obligations secured on property which becomesdamaged by air raids, and of relief to tenants from their obligations under leases to repair damaged property, should be taken into account by the proposed Ministerial Committee.ft ft ft ft 4^ ft
