0-FRENCH       1. THE PRIME MINISTER explained that the Foreign[ERSATIONS.Secretary was unable to be present owing to a long-viousference: standing engagement which could not be postponed,cabinet 55), Con-        He (the Prime Minister) proposed to give the Cabinetsion 1.)a brief   account of the field to be covered in the conversations with representatives of the FrenchGovernment.     The French Ambassador had communicatedan agenda consisting of ten items.     As there would notbe an opportunity for more than three or four hours&apos;discussion, it was obvious that,on most of the items,discussion could   not proceed very far.The Prime Minister then proceeded to set outbriefly the line which he and the Foreign secretary proposed to take on each of these ten items.(l)   Franco-British Co-operation in theOrganisation of   National Defence.It was understood that the French were likely tomake certain observations on the progress of our ownre-armament programme.     In particular, they were likelyto enquire what help we could give the French on land,and whether in our Air Programme we were turningover   from    the   construction   of   bomber aeroplanesto fighters.As regards the   army, the Prime Minister saidthat he proposed to take a firm line and to explain thelimits of what   we planned to do on the outbreak of war.It was, of course, impossible to say what might be donein the course of a long war, but he proposed to adhere to our existing plans as to the land forces which weshould have available on the outbreak of war.As regards the Air Programme he proposed toremove any misunderstanding which might have arisenas to a supposed change in our policy.If the French took the line that they wererelying   on us for the defence of Paris, then it would-1-
be necessary to make it quite clear to them that our air Force was being built up for our own defence.     Inthis connection he proposed to ask the French whetherthe declaration made by M. Delbos some   time back, ofFrench support for this country in the event of german aggression still held good.     There was no reason tothink that this declaration did not hold good, but, as ithad been given some time ago, it   would be as well toobtain some reassurance on the point.     If the Frenchanswered this   in the affirmative he proposed to ask them what   steps they would propose to take to help us. This might lead to a demand for foriher&apos;Staff conversations.     The foreign secretary, however, was inclined to discourage any extension of the scope of Staff conversations in regard,to   help- by    this country to France, although he might be willing that Staff conversations should beextended to cover French assistance to this   country.(2) Relations with Germany.The Prime   Minister said that he understood thatthe French were trying to obtain some declaration fromGermany on the same lines as the declaration which heand Herr Hitler had signed the day after the MunichAgreement.     There was no reason why we should regard this attempt on the part of the French with any suspicion.Indeed, we should   wish them all success in regard to it,provided, of course, that the declaration was in facton the same lines as the Munich declaration.In reply to a question by the President of theBoard of Trade, the Prime   Minister said that theposition would, of course, be different if the french were proposing to sign a pact of non-aggression whichwould   rule out French help to this country in theevent of German aggression;   but we had been givenassurances that this was not the case.
(3)   Relations with Italy.The Prime Minister thought that this matter wouldin fact largely he governed by the discussions on thenext item on the agenda, namely, Spain.(4) Spain.The Prime Minister said that he and the foreign secretary proposed to confine themselves to a general.review of the existing situation in the light of thereport by Mr. Hemming on his   visit to Spain, which hadbeen circulated to the British, French, German, italian and Portuguese Governments.     In effect, General Francohad indicated   that   he would turn down the Non-intervention Committee^ plan, unless he was firstaccorded belligerent rights.&quot;    In the special circumstances,the Foreign Secretary thought that it might be necessary forthe French and Italian Governments and ourselves to makea joint effort to reach some    settlement of the position by direct negotiation, and thus to short-circuit the plan of the Non-intervention Committee, which probably nowstood no chance of acceptance.The Prime Minister said that he did not thinkthat the prospects of reaching a settlement on this basis were very hopeful, owing to the absence of mutual confidence between the countries concerned.     A gentlemanwho had recently returned from Nationalist Spain had informed him that influential people in the nationalist government believed that the French were still sendingmunitions   across the border.     The Prime Minister didnot necessarily accept these allegations, but theyshowed the difficulty there would be in reaching asettlement.     He added that he gathered that general franco thought that if he could obtain belligerentrights he   would be able to bring the war to an end.
0 A Q6 4 a(previous reference:Cabinet55(38 ^Con-elusion 8).(previous reference:Cabinet54( 38 ^Con-elusion 4).THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that, while he did not wish to emphasise the legal point of view unduly,he thought it was somewhat strange that, havingregard to his position in other respects, general franco should not have been accorded belligerentrights.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the governing factor in this case had, Of course, been the extent offoreign interference in the Spanish dispute.(5) Central Europe and the Balkans.The Prime Minister thought that there would bea general discussion on this matter and that itwould be agreed,  first, that it was desirable to stop Germany from obtaining complete economic controlof this area, and, secondly, that it was difficult todo so, particularly if we were to avoid the appearance of becoming parties to a policy of encirclement.The Prime Minister doubted whether much progress would be made with this item.    He pointed out thatwe ourselves had not yet been able to formulate anyconcrete policy in this matter.(6) Eastern Europe.The Prime Minister said that we wished to knowmore about the French position vis-a-vis SovietRussia.    King Carol of Roumania had had a good deal to say as regards the position in the Ukraine.King Carol thought that Germany&apos;s intention wasto try to start the disruption of Russia byfostering an independent State in the Ukraine,which would, in effect, be under German influence.
The process might start hy the gradual building up inthe Ukraine of some body which purported to be adepressed minority.King Carol also thought that Russia had been much weakened by the recent purges which had takenplace, not only in the armed forces but also amongthe more intelligent and able people in thatcountry.The Prime Minister said that our attitude wouldbe governed largely by the fact that we did not wishto see Prance drawn into a war with. Germany onaccount of some quarrel between Russia and Germany,with the result that we should be drawn into war in france&apos;s wake.THE SSCRETiiRY OP STATE FOR HOME affairs emphasised that it was in our interest to see a strongRussia, and that we must not take any action which made it appear that we were anti-Russian, orindifferent to Russia&apos;s future.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed that this was so.At the same time it was desirable to avoid entangle-ments arising out of a possible dispute between russia and Germany.7. Eastern Mediterranean.Previous THE PRIME MINISTER said that a proposal had reference:Cabinet been mooted for a Franco-Turkish Alliance which,46(37),Con-clusion 11).    however, was dependent upon our adhesion.    The FrenchGovernment   would  be   informed   that, while our relations with each Power were excellent,we could not put such a scheme into effect unlessGreece was included;    and, further, that an Alliance    - .
comprising Great Britain, Prance, Turkey and greece would &quot;be certain to arouse suspicion in the mind ofItaly. It v/as clear, moreover, that Italy would not agree to join so general a pact, and we had reachedthe conclusion that the best plan was to be content with the existing position, and not to proceed withthe proposed Alliance.8. Syria and Palestine.It was understood that the French ambassador had reported that there was some friction between theBritish and French local agents in the Near East, andthat the French agents suspected that we were pursuingan anti-French policy.    It was proposed to make itclear in Paris that there was no truth in the report,and to say that if the French had any complaints theyshould state them to us frankly.9. Far East.(Previous The French had expressed anxiety about the FarReference:Cabinet Eastern situation, and, in particular, lest Japan should55(38),Con-clusion 4).    seize certain islands in the China Sea.There was also the question of the supply ofarms to China, and the question whether there was any possibility of mediation between China and Japan.The Prime Minister thought that it was somewhatunlikely that any practical results would flow fromdiscussion on these matters.In reply to the Secretary of State for India,the Prime Minister said that his impression wasthat arms were still going to China through Frenchm Indo-China, but in less quantities than hitherto
o i&quot; 910. The last item on the French Agendawas the League of Nations.11. Other Questions.In reply to the Minister of Transport, thePrime Minister said that no proposal had &quot;been made&quot;by the French to discuss the position of the north african territories.    This matter might arise out of discussions under the heading &quot;Relations with Italy&quot;.The Prime Minister&apos;s general impression was thatit was unlikely that matters other than &quot;Relationswith Germany&quot;, and &quot;Central Europe and the Balkans&quot;would he discussed in any detail.    In general, he regarded the visit as more in the light of a gestureto the French people and the French Government andnot as likely to result in any great advance indiplomatic relations..THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said thathe understood that the trial of strength in theFrench Chamber would come about December 6th.    Atthe present time the French franc was pegged to sterling, and the position of sterling was none toocomfortable.    He was anxious lest the French should put forward a proposal for pegging the&apos; franc to the dollar, rather than to sterling.THE PRIME MINISTER said that no proposal had been made to discuss financial matters.    Hewould be glad of a note from the Chancellor of theExchequer on the point which he had mentioned.The Cabinet approved generally the lines onwhich the Prime Minister and the Foreign secretary proposed to act in their conversations with theFrench Government and expressed their good wishes for the success of the visit.
2.     THE PRIME MINISTER said that the finalboundary had now been agreed between Germany and czechoslovakia.     The result might be described asa compromise in which Czechoslovakia had concededeverything and gained nothing.     A further 30,000Czechs and 6,000 Germans had passed under Germanrule.     The result was to be deplored but therewas nothing that we could do in regard to thematter.     The International Commission had confirmed the result;   no other course was opento them after the Czech representatives had reached agreement with the German representatives.
SIRE. 4.    The Cabinet had before them a joint memorandum by the Secretary of State for the DominionsDefences of.and Colonies and the Minister for Co-ordination of(previous reference: Defence (CP.  259 (38)) relating to a question?:Cabinet20(38),Con-raised with them on Mr.  de Valera&apos;s behalf concerningelusion 2).the arrangements for reorganising the defence services of Eire.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE DOMINIONS and colonies explained that Mr.  de Valera was now anxiousto take immediate action to improve the   conditionof the defences of Eire,  including the Treaty Ports.Mr.  de Valera had at first been anxious to invitean Officer from the British Army to advise him on defence matters, but after reflection he had come tothe conclusion that for internal political reasonsthis plan was impossible.Mr. de Valera then thought that the nextbest plan would be the appointment of a french general.    The Chiefs of Staff had objected to thisproposal as it appeared to involve the disclosureto a French Officer of secret information as to defence matters.    A counter proposal had been made that a suitably qualified officer might be foundin one of the Dominion Forces, but Mr,  de valera had not been prepared to accept this suggestion.After further discussion it had finally beenagreed that the Government of Eire should ask forand obtain from us, all the information as to port defences which was not secret and, therefore,could be communicated to a foreigner.-  this information could safely be imparted to a french general who would be appointed as adviser for aperiod only.    After the adviser had given the
assistance required he v/ould drop out, and weshould he able to cor.iv/iunicate to that Government any information of a secret nature which might be desired,upon the same footing as other Dominions.The Secretary of State for the Dominions and colonies said that the result v/as perhaps somewhatdisappointing but it was understandable0     He was satisfied that Mr. de Valera v/as anxious to adopta helpful attitude in regard to defence.      On thewhole he thought that the action proposed showed that Mr. de Valera really intended to make progress with joint defence plans, and that the proposal v/asa move in the right direction.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF defence said that the reason for urgency v/as thatMr. de Valera v/as anxious to make progress withthis matter while he himself was acting as Ministerfor Defence in the absence of Mr. Aiken, who wassuffering from the effects of an operation.     He alsowished to make it clear that the Chiefs of Stafftook the view that it was not safe to hand over to representatives of Sire so long as they have a Frenchadviser, any secret tatters, since it would beimpossible for the Eire representatives to avoiddisclosure of these matters to their adviser.     TheChiefs of Staff were not parties to the arrangementnow proposed, which they regarded as one which involved issues which must be settled by Ministers.
Considerable discussion then took place.It was pointed out that the ai*rancernent in regard tothe French Adviser involved certain difficulties0For example, supposing that when the   French adviserhad left, and certain secret information had been handed   over to the representatives of Sire, they wanted to consult the French adviser again, would they be permitted to do so?     Further       seemed likelywhen, after the departure of the French adviser,secret information was entrusted to representativesof Eire, they would not be in a position to knowwhether that information affected the advice whichhad been given by the French adviser,.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE DOMINIONS and colonies said that the representatives of Eire had agreed to staff talks at a later stage, and thatpoints of this kind could be cleared up in staff talks.Discussion then turned, cci the advisability of communicating secret information on defence matters to the representatives of the Eire Government.It was pointed out that it was only recently, asa result of the recent agreement made with therepresentatives of Eire that we had begun to supplysecret information on defence matters to them.Broadly speaking the view taken on this matter hadbeen that this was a risk which we must take, ifv/e were to secure co-operation on defence matterson the part of the Government of   Sire*
It was suggested, however, that a distinction might be drawn between information of ageneral character as to defence plans (in particular,as regards administrative arrangements) and information the disclosure of which would affect thesecurity of our defences elsewhere.     As examples ofthe latter type of information, reference was made toindicator loops and various range-finding apparatusused in coast defences.     It was explained that theinformation in this latter category had not at presentbeen disclosed.THE PRIME MINISTER expressed the view thatthere was an important question at issue here:    was it better that v/e should make disclosure to representa-tives of Eire of our secret apparatus in order toensure defences as complete as possible for the Irishports, at the risk of those secrets being disclosed to foreigners;    or would it be better that we shouldnot make disclosure of the secret apparatus to representatives of Eire and that, in consequence, thedefence of the Irish ports should not be brought up to&quot;the level of defences elsewhere?-     He thought thatthis was a matter which should be considered by theChiefs of Staff.It was pointed out that for the time being no immediate decision was called for on this issue.     Forthe moment the representatives of the Eire Governmentwere proceeding with their proposal to call in a french general as adviser, and for the time being there couldbe no question of conveying to them any furtherinformation of a secret charactero     The question whether
such information should be conveyed to them v/hen theFrench adviser had left was a matter which should beconsidered later.After further discussion,  the cabinet agreed:(i)   To take note that, as the result of thenegotiations which had taken place, ithad now been agreed that the Governmentof Eire should appoint a French general as Adviser for a limited period, andthat the Government of Eire have accepted the position, that no secret information should be disclosed tothis adviser:(ii)   That the question whether certainsecret information of a technicalnature relating to the defence of ports should be communicated to the eire Government when they had ceased to employ a French General as TechnicalAdviser, should be remitted to theChiefs of Staff.     The Chiefs of staff should be asked to consider whether itwould be better to make disclosures to representatives of Eire of our secretapparatus in order to ensure defencesas complete as possible for the Irishports at the risk of disclosure ofinformation as to such apparatus to foreigners, or whether it would bebetter not to make disclosures ofsuch secret apparatus , with   theresult that the defences of the Irishports could not be brought up to thelevel of defences elsewhere:That the Chiefs of Staff should be askedto consider generally what categories of information should, in their view,be communicated to the Eire Government,bearing in mind that co-operation in defence matters cannot be obtainedwithout disclosure of certain types ofinformation.(iii)
unemploymentinsuranceacts .^BvProposed^amending legislation.(previous reference:Cabinet 52(38), Con-clusion 5 and appendix II.)5. The Cabinet had under consideration a Memo-ran-dum by the Minister of Labour (CPc-256 (38)) recall-ing that a Bill to amend the Unemployment insurance acts had been promised in the King&apos;s Speech, andsubmitting for the approval of his colleagues an outline of the main provisions which he proposed toinclude in the Bill, under the following headings:-(l) Holidays and Unemployment Insurance.(2) Contributions and Paid Holidays .(3) Benefit and Payments by Employers totheir Workp&apos;- &quot;)ple.(4) Supplementary Schemes of UnemploymentInsurance *(5) Training of Serving Soldiers.The Cabinet approved the introductionof a Bill on the lines indicated bythe Minister of Labour in his Memo-randum (CP.-256 (38).
THE MINING 6. rp^e cabinet had before them a MemorandumINDUSTRY(WELFARE FUND) by the President of the Board of Trade (H.A.-35BILL.(38))  covering the draft Mining Industry (Welfare(Previous Fund) Bill, the principal provisions of which were reference:Cabinet 36 that the Miners&apos; Welfare levy should be increased(38), Con-clusion 9.) to Id. per ton for 5 years;    that the extra tkd .perton thus available should be applied to the building of pithead baths and ancillary purposes;    and the incorporation of a Miners&apos; Welfare Commission totake over the pov:ers and duties of the existingMiners&apos; Welfare Committee:    together with thefollowing reeorraendation thereon by the Committeeof Home Affairs (H.A.C. 17th Conclusions (38),Minute 1):-&quot;To authorise the introduction forthwith in the House of Commons of the MiningIndustvj (Welfare Fund) Bill in theform of the draft annexed to H.A.-35(38), subject to any drafting or other minor alterations that may be foundnecessary or desirable.&quot;The Cabinet approved the recommendationof the Committee of Home Affairs quoted above.
PUBLIC7S LOANS7. The Cabinet had under consideration a Memo-randum by the Financial Secretary to the Treasury(H.A.-36 (38))  covering the draft Public works loans Bill, the principal object of which was to fix at  25 millions the maximum sum which may beissued to the Public Works Loan Commissioners forthe purpose of making loans from the Local loans fund, up to the date of the passing of a fartherBill:    together with the following recommendationthereon by the Committee of Home Affairs (H.A.C.17th Conclusions, Minute 2): -&quot;To authorise the introduction forthwith in the House of Commons of the PublicWorks Loans Bill in the form of thedraft annexed to H.A0-35 (38), subjectto any drafting or other minor altera-tions that may be found, necessary or desirable 0,:The Cabinet approved, the recommendation ofthe Committee of Home Affairs quoted above.
THE PUBLIC HEALTH,(COAL MINE REFUSE)i BILL.8.The Cabinet had under consideration the Public Health (Coal Mine Refuse) Bill,introduced in the House of Commons by a Private(previous reference:Member and down for Second Reading on Friday,CabinetConclusi25th November, 1938.THE MINISTER OF HEALTH said that he had had some discussion with the Secretary for Mines,and he thought that the Government could acceptthe principle of the Bill.   He suggested thatthe Government Spokesman in the Debate should express general sympathy with the principlebehind the Bill and should explain theadministrative measures at present taken todeal with this matter.    At the same time itshould be pointed out that the proposals in theBill would, no doubt, give rise to a good deal of argument.    He thought that the main advantage in having on the Statute Book a measure suchas that now proposed would be that it would bea sanction in reserve, which would make the colliery owners more ready to conform to taeadvice given by the Mining Inspectors.Generally he suggested that the attitude of theGovernment Spokesman should be to give a friendlyreception at the end of what would, no doubt,be a somewhat lengthy discussion.said that he thought there were a number of points which should be referred to in the debate.    He instanced, for ex;imple,  thepossibility of parking spoil in mine dumps.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE
It v/as also pointed out that from thelegal point of view the proposal in Section Ithat coal mine refuse liable to spontaneouscombustion should be deemed a nuisance wasone which would probably give rise to legal difficulties,THE SECRETARY OP STATS FOR SCOTLANDthought that there were certain matters whichshould be discussed from the Scottish pointof view.The Cabinet agreed to the general line proposed by the Minister of Health.The view was expressed that it v/ould be some advantage if the Debate on the PublicHealth (Coal Mine Refuse) Bill v/as somewhatprolonged and allowed little time for thediscussion of the Official Secrets Bill.
O n Ql.&quot; U(The Attorney-General and the Lord Advocateentered the meeting at this point.)rfl3 OFFICIAL 3.    The Cabinet had under&quot; consxderation tile53CRETS BILL.Official Secrets Bill, introduced in the House of(reviousjferenee: Commons by a Private Member and down for Secondibinet 55 (38)^elusion 13)       Reading on Friday, 25th November, 1938;    together-   with a Note by the Home Secretary (C.P.-261 (38))r.R5**(5*)l3.circulating the Report of a Committee of Heads of departments set up to consider whether any amendmentof Section 5 of the Official Secrets Act, 1920,should be recommended.   The Committee felt it right that discretion should be vested in the executive to use the special powers of Section 6 in such easesas the Executive night judge proper, and preferred that the general principles of the Section shouldbe retained.   They were unable to recommend any amendment limiting the Section to a specific classof offence.    If, however, Ministers decided that a concession must be made to Parllamentary criticismin respect of the exercise of the powers of interro-gation under the Section, the Committee thought thatthe best practicable plan would be to amend theSection so as to require the prior consent in chambers of a Judge of the High Court.   The Committee attachedto their Report a draft Bill to give effect to this. major amendment .and to certain minor&apos;amendments of theexisting Section.
  o 9THE SECRETARY OF STATS FOR HOME AFFAIRS saidthat attention had &quot;been focussed on this Matter in1937 as a result of the Southport case.     The use ofthe Official Secrets Act had been discussed in theHouse of Commons and he (the Home Secretary) had circulated a memorandum to the Cabinet.     He hadlater made a statement to the House to the effectthat the Government could not make use of theOfficial Secrets Act except on some really serious matter.     Most of the Hoxise had been satisfied withthe statement then made, althoi,-:&apos;h there had been an undercurrent of feeling that he should have gonefurther.The matter had now been complicated bythe Sandys case.     Whereas previously the agitationhad largely been confined to the Press, the House ofCommons v/as now concerned in the matter.If Lieut.-Commander Fletcher!s Bill wasdebated, the Home Secretary doubted whether government supporters generally would be prepared to vote against it.     There was a large body of public opinion..which took the view that the Official Secrets Act should onlybe used in cases in which public safety was involved.It had been admitted that recourse had been made tothe Official Secrets Acts in regards to&apos; issues wherethe public safety v/as not involved.Continuing, the Home Secretary said thathe was afraid that public opinion on the matter might grow more restive and there might be a dangerof a demand that the v/hole Act might be repealed.     his advisers at the Home Office had reached the conclusion -thatHe
.right course was that the Government should putforward an amending Bill to restrict the use of theAct so far as concerned Section 6 of the Act of 1920.He referred to the report of the Committee of heads of departments which had reached the conclusion that theconsent in Chambers of a Judge of the High court should be obtained before use was made of the powers conferred by Section 6aThe Home Secretary added that he was disposed to think (and he understood that the Attorney-General agreed with him) that there was not very muchto be said for the retention of Section 6Q     He thoughtthat the necessary information could properly havebeen obtained quite as well without the necessity forrecourse to that Section.,THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR AIR thought thata good deal must be attributed to the politicalatmosphere with which the Official Secrets Act was nowsurroundedc     He thought that, if a Judge of the HighCourt dealt in Chambers with applications on the basis that the safety of the State was at issue, the public might be disposed to view the matter in a differentlight.THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL said that he concurred in the objections set out in the memorandum to thePrivate Memberfs Bill.He pointed out that Section 6 of the Act of1920 was designed to assist in criminal investigation.Primarily, the question to be settled was, therefore,whether this Section was required for criminalinvestigation of this type of offence.If this question was considered in vacuo,he came to the conclusion that the Section was not of
&apos;much value particularly in serious cases.     In suchcases, the person from whom information was soughteither v/as or was not an accomplice.     If he v/as not anaccomplice, he would be willing to give assistance.If, on the other hand, he was an accomplice the penalties for non-disclosure of information would notbe likely to have much influence upon him,     He was,therefore, disposed to take the view that the Sectionwas not of very much use.The Attorney-General added that the powers inquestion were stated in the Act in extremely general terms, and that if it v/as not intended that the power should be used generally, it would be much better thatthis should be specifically stated in the Act.THE LORD ADVOCATE said that he concurredgenerally in the views expressed by the Attorney-General.,     On the whole, he would prefer to see section 6 disappear altogether rather than to see itqualified.     At the same time, he said that the proposal in the memorandum for the amendment of this Sectionwas, in his view, workable0THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCEreferred to an unofficial undertaking given by a formerAttorney-General (Sir William Jowitt) as to thecircumstances in which the Section would be used.     Hethought that this was a grave disadvantage to theSection as it now stood and that on the whole we shouldbe better without it.THE LORD CHANCELLOR, while disclaiming any great experience in this matter, said that he thought thevalue of the Section could not be judged entirely by thecases in which it had been used.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE thoughtthat the Cabinet should consider the political aspectsof the total repeal of this Section,     Hitherto, the- 26 -
Government had taken the view that the retention of thisSection. wa&amp; of importance.     He thought that the proposal that application should he made to a High Court judge in Chambers would satisfy many people, particularly if the use of the Section were confined to issueswhere the safety of the State was involved.     Completerepeal of the Section might, however, be regardedas an unnecessary surrender,THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER thought thatit was necessary to consider what the position wouldbe if a really serious case arose.     What wouldpeople then say if the Government had abandoned a procedure which might be of value in dealing withsuch a case?THE MINISTER OP AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIESthought that some importance should be attached to thestatement in paragraph 5 of the memorandum whichstressed the deterrent effect of the Section, since aperson who was seeking to obtain secret information from another person can never undertake that, in no circumstances, will he disclose who his informant is.THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL and the LORD ADVOCATEsaid that, in expressing their views, they had beencareful to explain that they had been considering thematter in vacuo and they appreciated that completeabrogation of the Section might have embarrassingconsequences.     Speaking as prosecuting authoritiesthey would have no cause for apprehension if theSection was either abrogated entirely or if its powers were reduced.
u (Tl-L. KOiiLJ ol-iORLTjv-Y suggested that if thePrivate :..ei.her&apos;s Bill v/as not reached on Friday,a Cabinet Committee should be appointed toconsider the matter.      If the Bill v/as reached,he proposed that the Government spokesman should make a reasoned statement as to the position,setting out the facts, and ending with theconclusion that some change was called for.THE PRILIE IiINIST-jH thought that theBill would not be defeated unless a statementv/as made that the Government were prepared tointroduce legislation.THE LORD CPLilTCELLOR suggested that thestatement should be made on the lines that section 6 of the Act of 1920 as it stood was of too v/ide application and should be confined to cases of serious importance relating to the safety or welfare of the State.     Provided,however, that the Section was so limited, it wouldbe better that it should stay on the statute book.     No doubt it could be pointed out thatthe Section was rarely used, but that it was of some advantage to have it clearly statedthat in cases of this description there was a duty to give information.As regards the proposal that applicationsin these cases should be made to a High Court judge in Chambers, he was willing to agree to the course proposed, although on cc:aotitutional groundshe felt some reluctance to this course.
THE PRIME MINISTER was doubtful whether it was desirable to make the scope of Section 6 too narrow if theprocedure of application to High Court judge was introduced.There were a number of matters of great importance whichcould not be said to affect the safety of the State.The Prime Minister thought that the government spokesman should indicate that the matter had been thesubject of much consideration by the Government, that it wasagreed that some amendment of the Section was necessary, andthat the general lines of the proposed solution 3hould be indicated, without specifying them too closely.     It mightbe added that the Government   hoped     to introduce legis- -lation on the matter, and that it was hoped that the bill would be withdrawn.     He thought that if a statement wasmade on these lines it was unlikely that the second reading of the Bill would be passed.     Even, however, if the bill were passed, no special facilities would be accorded to it,and it was unlikely it v/ould make much progress.THE HOME SECRETARY said that if the Bill was onlydebated for an hour, he thought it would be unnecessary thatany statement should be made on behalf of the Government.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE hoped thatno very definite statement would be made in regard to makingapplications to a High Court Judge in Chambers, as he thoughtthat when the matter came to be worked out, certain diffi-culties in so doing might be revealed.THE CABINET agreed:-That if the Bill is debated on Friday, anda statement on behalf of the Governmentis necessary, a statement should be madeon the lines proposed by the Prime Minister./&quot;The Attorney-General and the Lord Advocate thenleft the Meeting.
