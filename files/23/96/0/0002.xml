lo      THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGNAFFAIRS gave the Cabinet a summary of the recent developments.Relations between Czechoslovakia andGermanyo     Direct negotiations had taken place as regards postal and railway matters.     So far,however, negotiations had not been opened asregards boundaries, financial or economic questions.     The German Government were due tosubmit their proposals as to options on the28th October.Internal situation in Czechoslovakia.A considerable reorganisation of political parties had taken place,      The Communist Par&quot;ty had been dissolved.     The Czechoslovak Government had decided to leave the Second International, and acertain tendency to anti-Jewish action had been observed.Relations between Czechoslovakia and poland.     There had been no development with theexception of Colonel Beck&apos;s visit to Roumania.Colonel Beck had not achieved his object, whichhad been to obtain Roumanian consent to a commonPolish-Hungarian frontier.Relations between Czechoslovakia andHungaryc     The new demand made by Hungary, whichhad been submitted on the 24th October and was more moderate than the previous demand, professed to bebased on a request for the return of areas with51 per cent, and over of Hungarian population, onthe basis of the 1910 census.     The czechoslovak government had made a counter offer of a smallerarea, and Hungary had offered a plebiscite inregard to the areas in dispute.     Hungary was also- 1 &quot;
aiming at a plebiscite in Ruthenia.     This had ledto a visit by Herr von Ribbentrop to Rome.The Foreign Secretary said that it was arguable that it would be to our advantage to allowRuthenia to be ceded to Hungary, thus cutting offGermany from Roumania and the Ukraine.      this argument, however, assumed that Hungary would be strong enough to act as a buffer State.     Further,Roumania    would object to the transfer of Rutheniato Hungary.     The Foreign Secretary added that hehad reached the conclusion that the possible advantages of cession to Hungary were too frailto justify any action on our part, and that our right course was to take the line that we v/ere not concerned in this matter.If the Czechoslovak Government refusedthe Hungarian demand for a plebiscite, Hungaryproposed that the matter should be submitted, so faras concerned the western areas in dispute,  to the arbitration of Germany and Italy;    and,  so far as concerned the eastern areas, to the arbitration ofGermany, Italy and Poland.     Czechoslovakia wouldcertainly refuse this proposal and would appeal tothe four Munich Powers.THE MINISTER OF TRANSPORT enquired intothe truth of the allegation that the Germans had crossed the new frontier at three hundred places.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that this mightbe due to faulty drawing of the frontier, or to action on the part of the German troops.     He hoped,without much confidence, that Germany would behavereasonably.     At the same time we had no particularlocus standi in the matter, and he thought thatCzechoslovakia might achieve more favourable resultsby direct negotiation with Germany than by invokingour aid. a
THE ANGLO-italian agreement.(previous reference:Cabinet 49(38), Con-elusion 6.)2,     The Cabinet had. under consideration a most secret Memorandum by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs (CoP.-231 (38))  dealing with thequestion whether the Anglo-Italian Agreement should now be brousrht into force.    In his Memorandum theSecretary of State pointed, out that since last may the only obstacle to its entry into force had beenthe settlement o^ the Spanish question.   He recalledthe statements which had been made to the ItalianGovernment aa to what might be regarded as a settle-ment of the Spanish question, and the pledges whichhad been given to Parliament.    The question now for decision was whether Signor Mussolini&apos;s withdrawal from Spain of half the Italian infantry (10,000 men)warranted the bringing into force of the Agreement.After describing the Italian point of view andsummarising the arguments in favour of bringing theAgreement into force, the Secretary of State reachedthe conclusion that this  course should be adopted.He believed that if the present opportunity were netgrasped, it might never recur *   He therefore hopedthat the Cabinet would, give its approval to thenecessary steps being taken to bring the Anglo-italian agreement into force.In introducing the subject, the SECRETARYOF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS referred to the commitments which we had entered into in this matter,as set out in paragraph 12 of his memorandum.      Heaft^achod particular Importance to the definitiongiven by the Prime Minister on the 26th July last,that if Spain has ceased to be a menace to thepeace of Europe, we should regard that as a
se-tijj^mejvt -of the Spanish question.-.     He thought that,looking both at the facts of the case and at publicopinion, the Spanish conflict was now of much less importance and was far less likely to be a cause ofany major international complication.     He also thought that the withdrawal which had taken place v/ascertainly a withdrawal on a considerable scale, andthus conformed to the definition of a settlement ofthe Spanish question given to the Italian Governmenton the 20th June.Turning to the arguments in favour of bringing the Agreement into force as summarised inparagraph 14, the Foreign Secretary said that he attached particular importance to (b) and (c).He thought that it was important that we should do all we could to liberate Signor Mussolini by degreesfrom the pressure to which he was subjected from Berlin.He also thought that, unless we brought the Agreementinto force now, it was unlikely that we should be ableto resume our former friendly relationship with Italy.If we allowed the present opportunity to pass, hethought that we should have the worst of both worlds.We should neither prevent Mussolini from intervening in spain, nor should we improve our relations with Italyand obtain the advantages of putting a stop to italian anti-British propaganda in the Middle East8The Foreign Secretary said that his ownconclusion was that every argument was in favour of putting &quot;he Agreement into force, with the one exception of the criticism to whioh that course wouldgive rise in this country.     In connection with suoh
criticism, the Foreign Secretary invited attentionto the statement in paragraph 4 of the assurances given and of the assurances requested but not yet given.The most difficult question concerned the boirMngof British ships.     He hoped that if the cabinet was prepared to put the Agreement into force, theywould also agree that he might communicate thisdecision at once to Lord Per-h.      In this case, the intervening days could be used in an endeavour tosecure some further assurances from the ItalianGovernment.In answer to the Prime Minister, theForeign Secretary said that he thought the FrenshGovernment would, if asked, agree to our statingpublicly that the action now proposed had their fullapproval.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA said thathe agreed with the Foreign Secretary&apos;s view.     Hehad been much impressed by the feeling of uncertaintywhich had been aroused in Italy by the determination,which had become evident in this country since the crisis, to concentrate on rearmament.     Many Italiansthought that we were still resentful and meditatedrevenge, and it was necessary to disabuse them of this idea.The Secretary of State for India asked foran explanation of the phrase us^d in Signor Crolla&apos;sletter of the 10th August in which he had stated thatthe only condition for the application of the Anglo-Italian Agreement of the 16th April was the total,or substantial, withdrawal of volunteers from Spain-.The total number of Italians in Spain was 43,000 of
whom 12,000 had been withdrawn0     This was substantialwithdrawal, but was very different from totalwithdrawal.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs explained how this letter came to be written.     TheItalian Government had thought that the statement madeby the Prime Minister on the 26th July (see paragraph12 (b)) had represented an addition to the conditions-which we had laid down in the first instance for the putting into effect of the Anglo-Italian Agreement (see annex l)e     The Note of the 4th August (see Annex III)had been written to make it plain to the ItalianGovernment that no new condition v/as to be imposed.The phrase &quot;total or substantial withdrawal&quot; had been used by Signor Crolla when linking up the statementof our views given in the despatch of the 17th Junewith the Prime Minister&apos;s letter of the 4th August.The Foreign Secretary thought that our most serious difficulty in this matter arose from the fact that inJune last, we had not specified a substantialwithdrawal of air forces.     At that time the positionof the Italian air forces in Spain was not relativelyas important as it was to-day.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR was in favourof bringing the Agreement into force, as being in line with the general policy of European appeasement.He felt sure that this course would have the general approval of the country, but he hoped that theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs would try toget satisfactory assurances in regard to the bombing of ships.
THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR said that from the War Office point of view there was every advantage in the course proposed.    As soon as theAgreement came into force, the Italian forces now inLybia (at present 50,000) would be reduced, and the tension in Palestine v/ould also be reduced,THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that  the publichad been greatly impressed by the fact that signor mussolini had gone to Munich and that his presencethere had been helpfulo    He thought that this might beof assistance in the public presentation of the case.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL agreed withthe action proposed, but thought that a certain sectionof public opinion might take the view that thev/withdrawal of 10,000 troops did not represent asettlement of the Spanish question.    He suggested that although it might not be possible to obtain the with-drawal of Italian machines,  we might secure thev/withdrawal of a number of Italian airmen aIn reply to a question,  the SECRETARY OFSTATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said that there had not been so far any withdrawal of volunteers from the SpanishGovernment side.    He doubted whether, notwithstanding%Mr. Hemming&apos;s efforts, General Franco would agree tothe Nqn-Intervention Committee&apos;s scheme for thewithdrawal of troops.    He had some hope, however,that if the Anglo-Italian Agreement was put into force,we might, in conjunction with the French reach anagreement that certain steps should be taken whichwould have the effect of withdrawing foreignassistance from both sides.
THE PRIME MINISTER thought that on this aspect of the matter a good deal might depend on thegrant of belligerent rights.       If   a   stage were reached when these could be conceded, General Francomight prove amenable on a number of matters.    ThePrime Minister mentioned that he had had some discussion the previous day with the Duke of Alba who had seemedto be of the opinion that the war in Spain v/ould notbe over for some considerable time-    He had made thepoint that, as the Government lines became shorter,they were more strongly held, and that in a mountainouscountry a small force could put uo a strong resistance.It might thus prove to be the case that the Governmentforces could only be defeated by shortage of supplies,particularly food.    This was probably the significance of the bombing of British shipsoThe Prime Minister agreed,  however,  with anobservation by the Foreign Secretary that it wasimpossible to make the bringing into force of theAnglo-Italian Agreement dependent upon the institution of a non-intervention scheme which would be secured by the grant of belligerent rights to General Franco.Continuing, the Prime Minister said that hethought the discussion had brought out one of the realdifficulties of the case, namely, that we should put the Agreement into effect on the basis of thewithdrawal of 10,000 men.    He thought the Governmentwould be on much stronger ground if they stood on the definition which he had given on 26th July, namely,that we should regard the Spanish question as settledwhen Spain had ceased to be a menace to the peace of
Europe (Sec paragraph 12(b) of C-P. 231(38)).    he also hoped the approval of the French Governmentwould be secured.    He regarded the bringing intoforce of the Agreement as an essential step in thepolicy of general European aopeascment.The Prime Minister added that informationv/hich he had received at the Munich Conference hadconvinced him that both Herr Hitler and signor mussolini were anxious to get out of Spain as soon asthey could, provided they did not let General Francodown.    They had both sent troops to Spain in the firstinstance in order to prevent Spain being Bolshevised,but they were now convinced that there was no dangerof this happening,      yTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIESreferred to General Franco&apos;s desire for neutralityand his willingness to sign a non-aggression pactwith. Portugal,  at the time of the crisis.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he wouldconfirm v/hether it was possible to make public useof General Franco&apos;s attitude at that time.    As toprocedure, he thought it would be convenient that thedecision to put the Anglo-Italian Agreement intoforce should be announced as soon as Parliamentre-assembled by Private Notice Question, and that oneor two of the prorogation days should be devoted to debate on the matter.    He proposed to inform theUnited States Government of the action which we were taking in this matter,.
The Cabinet a greed:-(1) To approve the necessary steos beingtaken to bring the Anglo-italian agreement into force.(2) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should have authority tocommunicate this decision immediately in confidence to the Italian Government,and should endeavour to secure furtherassurances from the Italian Governmenton the lines indicated in CP. 231(38).(3) That the main ground on which thedecision to put the Agreement intoforce should be justified should bethat Spain had now ceased to be a menace to the peace of Europe.
PALESTINE.3.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES(previous reference:Cabinet 49(38) Con-clusion 10).great success v/ith which the Military Authoritiessaid that he thought it was right to refer to he had  carried out the very difficult and delicatem.S2operation of the occupation of the Old City of jerusalem.     The Cabinet Committee had already discussed the political aspect and he hoped thatthey v/ould be able to submit a Report to theCabinet in a week&apos;s time.     He would, therefore,defer   any further   statement until the next meeting of the Cabinet.,
DEFENCE PRE-PARAT TONS.Forecast ofSupply Posi-tion and Basisof future policy.(previous reference:Cabinet 49(38), Con-clusion 11.)4*     The Cabinet had before them a Most&apos; Secret Memo-randum by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence(C.P.-234 (38))  circulating for the consideration ofhis colleagues three statements drawn up at his request by the Service Departments to show theprogress of the Defence Programmes on 1st Augustnext.   After explaining his reasons for selecting1st August, 1939, as the date to which this informa-tion should be related, the Minister summarised, theposition of the three Services as at that date and pointed out that two major questions were raised bythe above documents..The first was whether recent events called forany revision of the scope of the authorised Pro-grammes of the three Services .    Tn this connection he pointed out that the present scale of equipment of the Territorial Army would not enable it to traineffectively on embodiment, and that it would benecessary to consider some increase in the scale atpresent authorised c.The second question was whether there was, on merits and not on politics, any ground for immedi-ately altering our central supply organisation bythe establishment of a Ministry, of Supply .   Aftersummarising the arguments for and against, theMinister thought it misht well be that within the framework so far set for re-armament, quicker and better results would be obtained by continuing to rely on the existing supply departments, which hadbeen reorganised for the purpose of securing speedin provision.
In introducing the paper,  the MINISTER FORCO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE said that he understood thatthe statements had been drawn up on a con.ervativebasis, and that the state of preparedness which weshould have reached next August would probably havebeen found to be understated.     As regards the suggestions for acceleration made in the three papersappended to this memorandum, the Minister said thathe proposed to confer forthwith with his Servicecolleagues.     There were, however, a number of wider aspects on which Cabinet approval would have to be .obtained.The Minister referred to the fact that incertain isolated instances the War Office contractsunder the authorised programme would shortly becompleted.      In these, and certain other cases,additional production could be obtained by 1st Augustif authority were given now to place additional ordersover and above the existing approved programmes.In this connection it was necessary to bear in mind that, in addition to our own requirements, we were constantly faced with demands from foreign countries for the supply of munitions;    demands which we were only too frequently unable to meet.In the course of the discussion v/hich ensued,the SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR stated that, so far asthe air was concerned, he did not think that theposition could be regarded as other than disquieting.He was putting up new proposals which he would shortly be in a position to submit to his colleagues.     Theseproposals were based on a long-term programme and wentbeyond what had already been approved0
THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR HOME affairs said that he was particularly concerned v/ith theposition in regard to anti-aircraft equipment and hethought that it was necessary that we should reconsider the existing A.A. programme*     He based himselflargely on Admiralty experience which went to showthat, provided a sufficient number of guns v/ereemployed, a target could be made either invulnerableor so strong that it was unlikely to be attacked.He thought that the key points in this country should be given a far greater degree of protectionthan was provided for in the existing scheme.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS    -supported the view taken by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence as to the need for improving ourposition in regard to the supply of arms to Egypt andother foreign countries     As regards our own position, he favoured increased anti-aircraftprotection rather than the provision of equipment forthe Territorial Army.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Minister&apos;s paper had raised two main issues.      The firstconcerned the establishment of a Ministry of Supply.He thought that this was an issue which the cabinet should discuss and attempt to settle that day.      Theother issue was really a series of questions, as forexample:    (l)   What deficiencies existed?      (2)   what steps should be taken to accelerate production?(3)   Whether the existing programmes of the services should be extended and if so in what respects?     this last question could not be divorcefrom the financialissue.     We had had a small indication the other day
that confidence in our financial position had shown some signs of weakness.     It must &quot;be remembered thatour financial resources would be one of our great assets in any long war, and he thought that any big war would necessarily be a long war.     In considering extensions to the authorised programmes it was impossible todeal with Departments individually.      It wasnecessary to take into account the demands of all theService Departments and the aggregate cost.     Thiswas not a matter which could be dealt with by theCabinet until the position had been clarified.     he proposed that this matter should be considered by theMinister for Co-ordination of Defence in conjunctionwith the three Service Ministers, the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Minister of Labour.     He thoughtthat these Ministers would find it convenient to haveassociated with them certain official members of theCommittee of Imperial Defence.     He proposed that aCommittee on these lines should be appointed to enquire into the matters which he had mentioned and to submit areport to the Cabinet.   No doubt there might-be a number of matters which this Committee could dispose of withoutawaiting submission to the Cabinet.-
THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER supported the suggestion.    He expressed his concurrence ofthe statement in paragraph 6 of the Minister&apos;s paper in regard to the financial aspect of theproblem involved.    It was clear that we should be faced vsnth a deficit in the Spring.    Meanwhile,  therevenue was drooping and recent experience in regardto the sterling dollar exchange was far from encouraging.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR said that hethought that we must proceei on the basis of a new conception of the position in which safety and security wouldhave first place.    We must never again find ourselves in the position in which we had been on the 25thSeptember.    He felt tha7: our present weakness in defence seriously hampered the Prime Minister&apos;efforts for peace.He also thought that it was important thata decision should be reached at an early date,  since it v/ould be necessary for an announcement to be madeas soon as the new Parliament reassembled regardingthe action we were taking to make this country safe.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR supported the Secretary of State for Air&apos;s views in regard tothe need for an early decision.    He referred to thetime which had been occupied in carrying out the review of defence programmes, in order that the limits of our available resources should not be exceeded,in his view, we could not continue to tolerate aposition in which the equipment of the Territorial army was sadly deficient,  and our Regular Army was 20,000short of establishment.    prompt decisions were necessary.
THE PRIME MINISTER, while agreeing thatit v/as necessary that the matter should be promptlyconsidered,  said it was clear that an issue of priority was involved.    Until this matter had beenconsidered,  the Cabinet had not the material onv/hich to reach a decision-,    In regard to v/hat theSecretary of State for War had said, he assumed thatthe Secretary of State did not propose that Treasurycontrol should be abandoned.Discussion then turned on the composition of the proposed Committee.    The view generallyexpressed v/as that the Committee should be a CabinetCommittee composed of the Ministers referred to bythe Prime Minister,  together v/ith the addition of theHome Secretary in order that Air Raid precautionrequirements might be related to other demands.It would,  of course,  be understood that the CabinetCommittee would have authority to invite the presenceof officials as required.The Cabinet agreed:-(l) That a Cabinet Committee should beappointed, comprising -The Minister for Co-ordinationof Defence (Chairman),The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Home Secretary^The First Lord of the Admiralty,The Secretary of State for War,The Secretary of State for Air,The Minister of Labour,to consider proposals for extending the scope of the Defence programmes and measures designed to accelerateproduction:
(2) That the Committee should havepower to invite the attendance of officials as required:(3) That the Paper prepared by theSecretary of State for Air (C-P. 218(38))on the improvement of this country&apos;position in the Air, should be referredto this Committee.
THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE said thathe had little to add to his Memorandum.     He was disposed to think that, on balance, if a Ministry of Supply were set up, it would involve some delay in the programme during the immediately ensuing months..     Further, the separation of supply from the other executive branchesof the Services would result in some delay andinoonvenicnce0     If the Ministry of Supply were now to beset up and were to mobilise industry as a whole, then if wardid not come the result might well be the accumulation ofa vast and unnecessary supply of munitions,.     If, however,compulsion was only applied to a limited number of firms,many difficult problems would be involvedoTHE PRIME MINISTER said that he thought that theexercise of discrimination in the use of compulsory powers which would be applied to some firms but not to others, woV-ld present a very difficult problem.     Further,both employers and Trades Unions would take the line thatwe had not yet exhausted the possibilities of voluntary-operation.     Our general attitude on this matter should,he thought, be that we had not yet reached the positionwhen we required compulsory powers, but that we should notrule out the possibility that such powers might prove necessary later.The Prime Minister referred to the position inregard to anti-aircraft guns.     What was now holding usback was the need for very highly skilled men.     Virtuallythe only men who possessed the qualities required were employed in the tool-rooms in the country.     No doubtthis labour could be obtained by compulsory powers, but
if this course were adopted it would give rise to a lot of trouble.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR thought that itv/ould be helpful if the Government decision was presented in such a way as would make it clear thatrecourse to compulsory powers v/as at the back of our minds, and that we should not hesitate to ask for such powers if necessary.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA said on the1st November that he was replying on behalf of theGovernment to the following Motion by Lord StrabolgiJ*r&quot;To move, to resolve, that an independent committee of enquiry be set up to examineinto the state of the National Defences,with particular reference to Air RaidPrecautions.&quot;He assumed that the Government would wish him to oppose this Motion, and that he should also oppose thecreation of a Ministry of Supply, notwithstanding thefact that on a previous Debate this issue had resulted in the uniting of the Liberal and LabourOppositions in the House of Lords.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said that he agreed with the Prime Minister&apos;s method of approach.He thought that it was necessary to take thispreliminary step of making a further effort to seek the co-operation of industry.     On merits, however, hewould have preferred an Immediate decision in favour of taking compulsory powers.     The War Office Paper showed that further substantial acceleration was dependent uponadditional skilled, labour.     He also quoted a statementfrom the last Ministry of^Labour Progress Report(D.P.R.289) which indicate-&quot;  iinat--existing labour would be-SO-
inadequate to meet the demands of the War Officeand Air Ministry unless labour now engaged on civil work was turned over to munitions.    that paragraph had been drawn up on the basis of existing programmes, and the situation would be aggravatedif those Programmes were increased,THE MINISTER OP LABOUR said that in his view the crux of the problem lay in making proper useof our existing industrial capacity.    The responsi- -bility for solving the problem could not be placedon the shoulders of the Trades Unions.    The first stage was to inform the contractors of our total requirements and then to make sure that the best possible use was made of existing capacity.Provided that coursewe:-^ taken, the labour which went with that capacity would be properly employed.He did not think that armament orders had beenplaced on a sufficiently wide basis,  and he feared that skilled labour had been somewhat extravagantlyused.THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR AIR said that, bofar as the Air Programme was concerned,  a consider-able measure of success had attended the steps taken to augment the labour supply, without serious trouble with the Trades Unions.The view was then expressed that a decisionagainst the establishment of a Ministry of supply would meet v/ith a considerable volume of criticism.It was suggested that it would be said that under our existing system we had failed to produce anadequate supply of munitions and that public opinion would not be satisfied with a Government reply which in effect rested on a continuance of existing arrangements.
As against this it was pointed out that&apos; there wasno reason to suppose that if a Ministry of supply had been established two or three years ago we should now have no deficiencies.     It was well known that it took the better part of two years to organise a new system of production for munitions, and that it was onlyin the third year that a s\\bstantial flow of production could be assured.      It was necessary to avoid bothexcessive criticism and excessive optimism.     Broadly,with the exception of certain difficult bottle-necks, thegreater part of the Defence Programmes as authorised hadbeen satisfactorily carried out, and blame could not beplaced upon the Defence Departments if it was now feltthat we should have started to re-arm earlier, or thatour Programmes should originally have been drawn on alarger scale.The view was also expressed that the use of compulsory powers might well result in serious difficultiesin the labour field.     It was, however, suggested that evenif it was decided that the time was not yet ripe for theadoption of compvilsory powers, there was much to be said for the setting up of a Ministry of Supply to operate on a voluntary basis, in order to ensure that plans for voluntary co-operation were carried out morecomprehensively than in the past.THE PRIME MINISTER said that, if it was the general view of the Cabinet, he thought that it was not necessary onthe present occasion to go further than to agree that atthe present time the setting up of a Ministry of Supplywith compulsory powers was undesirable.     He thought
that the question whether -it was desirable toset up a Ministry of Supply with voluntary powersto accelerate production, &quot;by ensuring the most efficient use of the labour in the country, was onewhich should be discussed later.     He proposed thatthe Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, afterconsultation with him, should submit a Memorandumon this topic for consideration by the Cabinet on 2nd November, 1938.This course was agreed to.
5.        The Cabinet, had under^ consjiderati^h-.aJi[Qi.eby the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence (C.P.-235 (38))  circulating a Memorandum on the subject ofNational Service, by the Chairman of the Sub-Committeeof the Committee of Imperial Defence on the Controlof Man-Power.    In his Note the Minister explainedthat the Sub-Committee had been re-assembled toconsider certain la,cunae in Man-power arrangementsrevealed during the recent emergency, and had submitted the following proposals&quot;(l) That a Handbook on National Service,which should have a Foreword by thePrime Minister an^ give particulars of all the services for which volunteersare required, should, immediately beprepared, for wide eireulation,   ^hisHandbook would invite persons to volunteerfor those services for which they arebest suited.(2) The handbook would, inform persons whofind difficulty in deciding for whichservice they should, volunteer, that theymay apply for advice at the employment exchange.(3) That voluntary registers should be main-tained at the Employment Exchanges ofpersons for whom no place can be found at present in the existing services, but who would be willing to undertake anysuitable service if called upon.(4) That the Ministry of Labour should, maintain a central voluntary register for people with professiona.1 or other special qualifi-nations who would be prepared to undertake work of a specialised  character in theevent of war.    ^his work would largely becarried out through the professional bodies concerned.&quot;The Sub-Committee were of opinion that a compulsory national Register would only be of value as a preludeto compulsory National Service.The Minister stated that, the Sub-Committee was now engaged on elaborating a. scheme on the above lines.   He anticipated that when the Government&apos;policy in this matter was - explained, to parliament it would also be necessary to give some indication
of the existence of the Schedule of Reserved Occupa-tions.   An announcement on these lines would, hethought, provide an answer to those critics who feared that the Government had taken no steps to prevent the dislocation of essential industries in wartime, andwould help to allay the demand for the establishmento^ a National Register.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF defence said that he had little to add to his Memorandum.He thought it was   essential that all the differentopportunities for service should be brought together and particulars set out in a handbook, which wouldenable the people of this country to see clearly in what directions they could most usefully offer their services.     The first essential was to filli up thegaps in existing services.     The publication of ahandbook would help to direct the voluntary effort ofthis country into useful channels.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HOME affairs thought it would be essential to give clear guidance as to the Reserved Occupations.      This would applyparticularly to Air Raid Precautions Services.     Thetotal demand for these services reached li million people, of whom % million would, he thought, have tobe whole-time.THE PRILtE MINISTER said that he had thoughta good deal   about this matter but had not reached the stage of working out a definite plan.     He thought thata new Minister was required who might have to have special responsibility for Air Raid Precautions Services.He thought that without attempting   a register of allthe people in this country, it was necessary to getpeople allotted to the various voluntary services, and
that persons so allotted should he organised.There was much that could he done in this direction,hut the exact title or functions of the proposedMinister had not yet been worked out.     He would prefer to put a proposal on these lines before theCabinet next   week.     He definitely contemplated that a Linister should be appointed, but he wasnot enamoured of the title &apos;National Service 1 ,which he thought would make Labour suspicious.THE MINISTER OP L A3 OUR thought that, as 7**r-i-t-weuld be-ncccoGary tojiave a consultation with-.  .employe-rs-ovey-^he-Sohodulo of Roo-orvod&apos; Occupations)it would be necessary to publish   the Schedule.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that, while he had not studied the matter very fully, he was not wholly convinced that steps shouldnot now be taken to set up a compulsory register.He also thought that a compulsory register would be useful as showing the total resources of this country,and the register could usefully be linked with a voluntary system.In this connection, THE MINISTER OFLABOUR pointed out that his Department already had a complete register of the insured population and it had conducted a special review in regard toskilled craftsmen.     The real need was to establishcontact with persons in.-ihe middle   classes who hadparticular-aptitudes and were willing to offertheir services.
THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR HOME affairs said he had reached the conclusion that a oompulsoryregister v/as only of value if it were accompaniedhy compulsory training.     He thought that a gooddeal of value would be obtained from the appointmentof a Minister and better   arrangements for trainingpersonnel.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLANDsaid that he thought the country was looking for something more than the publication of a handbookand was prepared to see a National Register at once.If   war came, we should adopt compulsory service at once.     Was there not, therefore, a lot to besaid for the immediate adoption of a register?In the course of further discussion,the MINISTER OF HEALTH referred to the reactions ofthis problem on the scheme for wholesale evacuation.He doubted whether a decision could be reached on national service until decisions had been reached in regard to a number of   civil defence measures.THE PRIME MINISTER said that this point would be borne in mind.The Cabinet agreed: -To defer further consideration ofthe questions raised in CP.235 (38)until the meeting of the Cabinet tohe held on Wednesday, 2nd November,when the Prime Minister would make astatement in regard to the appointmentof the proposed new Minister to dealwith National Service matters.
