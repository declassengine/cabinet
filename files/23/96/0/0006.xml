cabinet arrangements.1.THE PRIME MINISTER reminded hie colleagues that on Wednesday, 16th November, a Luncheon wasbeing given at the Guildhall by the Corporation ofLondon to King Carol of Roumania.     It would therefore be necessary that the Cabinet Meetingon that date should be held at 10 a.m., and that ministers should attend in uniform.following the usual custom, his colleagues would return to No0 10 Downing Street at the conclusionof the Armistice Ceremony on 11th November.The Prime Minister also hoped that,
2.      THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that Lord Strabolgi had put down a Motion fordiscussion in the House of Lords next week on the sinking of Spanish ships in the North Sea,     Theaotion taken by General Franco^ ships raiseddifficult legal issues.     It v/as proposed that thematter should be discussed between representatives ofthe Foreign Office, the Admiralty and Trinity House.When this discussion had taken place he might wishto make certain recommendations to the Cabinet.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY explained thatthe ship sunk off the Norfolk coast had only 33 feet of water over it and that the wreck would have to bebuoyed. The ship sunk off the Dutch coast was sunkin 8 or 9 fathoms. Two more ships were due to sailshortly which might be attacked.Some discussion ensued as to the legal aspectsof the matter.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs explained that, provided the sinking was carried out bybona fide ships of war, that the normal rules in regardto preliminary warning and so forth were observed, andthat no action was taken within territorial waters,the Foreign Office were disposed to regard theproceedings as irregular (inasmuch as we had not agreedto grant belligerent rights to Nationalist Spain), butnot as amounting to acts of piracy.It was pointed out that the extra expenseof buoying the wrecks v/ould fall, via the Light Dues,on the British Mercantile Marine.
THE PAR EAST.China and Japan.Navigation onthe Yangtze.United StatesRepresentations.(previous reference:Cabinet 52 (58)Conclusion 2)F?R. 55 (3S) k-.(reference cabinet 47 (57)Conclusion 4)3.      THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGNAFFAIRS said that he had been informed by theUnited States Embassy on 3rd November that theUnited States Government had decided to make representations to Japan as to the freedom of navigation of the Yangtze up to Hankow.     TheUnited States had enquired of the French and ourselves whether we were prepared to make parallelrepresentations.     They had asked also, of thiscountry only, what action we should be prepared totake by way of retaliation if the reply to the irrepresentations was unfavourable.The Foreign Secretary thought that this action was somewhat significant, since up tillnow the United States Governments representations to the Japanese Government had been made .independently.The Foreign Secretary said that our interests in navigation on the Yangtze w4re far greater than those of the United States, and he had felt that we were bound to agree to make representations on the lines suggested.     He hadnot, however, given any indication as to the steps which we would be prepared to take if a favourableanswer was not received.     He reminded hiscolleagues that this matter had been considered inthe Cabinet a year ago and that it had then beendecided that there was nothing in the way of retaliation that we could do which, on balance,would be of any advantage to us.     At that time,however, we had considered taking action by ourselves alone, butp if the United States were now
prepared to act with us,the position might he different.This was a matter which might require furtherconsideration later, but no action was at present called for.THE PRIME MINISTER thought that the attitudeof Japan was becoming increasingly arrogant and difficult,but that the United States Governments proposal to have recourse to economic pressure, and to rely on economic pressure only, was not likely to be very effective.Suppose, for example, that we joined with the UnitedStates in economic pressure and that the results werehighly inconvenient to Japan, the next step might be a japanese attack on Hong-kong     Might we not at some stagehave to ask the United States Government what action they would be prepared to take in that event?     This,however, was a point which could be considered later.THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGN affairs said that he had recently seen the Chinese Ambassador,who had given him a not too gloomy   account     of affairs in China.     He had said that China had time and space on her&apos;side, and that it would be difficult for theJapanese to manoeuvre in the hilly country into which theChinese forces were now retiring.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY reported that.M.S. ROBIN had now  sailed.      H.M.S. CICALA had gotthrough at an earlier dateo
FRANCE. 4.      THE SECRETARY DP STATE FOR FOREIGN &quot;AEFAIRS said0Foreign Policy, that he had had a letter from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador(previous reference: in Paris commenting on the attitude likely to he adoptedCabinet 49(58),Conclusion 4). by M. Reynaud now that the latter had become Minister off -55Y3*^&apos;- Finance.     He thought that M. Reynaud&apos;s influence would^u-. be directed towards a somewhat stiffer foreign policy,and closer relations with Soviet Russia.
I0GLO-I TALI ANliGREEMENT.[devious! Reference:Cabinet 52(53),Conclusion 6).5.      THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that Lord Perth and Count Ciano were now settling the dates for the signing of the Protocol and forthe presentation, by the former, of his new credentials.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TR*u)E said thatthe United States Government were anxious that thereshould be two or three clear days between the signature of the Anglo-American Trade Agreement and the signature of the documents bringing into force the Anglo-ItalianAgreementeTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that the 16th November had been fixed provisionallyfor the signature of the documents in connection withthe Anglo-Italian Agreement, and he hoped that itwould not be necessary to alter this date, which count ciano had accepted as satisfactory.It was agreed that the President of the Boardof Trade should communicate with the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs on this matter at an earlydate.

THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that he hoped to circulate for consideration atthe next weekly mooting of the Cabinet the comprehensivepicture of the position in the Balkans, which he had suggested should be prepared.     He thought that itv/ould be helpful to the Cabinet to see the positiongenerally, but he suggested that the paper might perhapsthen be remitted to the Foreign Policy Committee for detailed examination.
IMPERIAIi AIRWAYSAND BRITISHAIRVAYS .^ProposedAmalgamat ion,(previous reference ?Cabinet 49(38), Con-cluaion 17.)pr. 2.*]^) 2..8.       The Cabinet had before them a Joint Memorandumby the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretaryof State for Air (C.P.-246 (38))  informing their colleagues that the informal meeting of Ministersproposed in the Conclusion mentioned in the marginhad agreed in principle to the proposed amalgamation of Imperial Airways and British Airways.   The schemeinvolved, the formation of a Public Corporation, withcertain statutory limits on its powers .     the chairmen of the t,-ro Companies had also agreed, inprinciple to aTalgaraation and to a Public Corpora-tion.   Authority was therefore sought in the Kerao-ran&amp;urn for the preparation of the legislation necessary to set up ^he proposed Corporation andto give the Treasury power to guarantee principaland interest on its stocks.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said thathe had little to add to the Memorandum.     It hadbeen agreed in principle that the dividends of theamalgamated concern should be limited.     A StatutoryCompany provided by far the best method of securingthis result.     The money required would be raised byan issue of fixed interest stook on which the principal,and interest would be guaranteed by the Government.There would be no other issue of shares.     He asked the Cabinet to approve the preparation of thenecessary Bill.The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained thatthe annual meeting of Imperial Airways was being held on Monday afternoon.      It was essential thatthe Governments intentions in this matter should be announced in the House well in advance of thismeeting.     It had previously been suggested thatthere should be more or less simultaneous announcements
in the House of Commons about a quarter to four andby Sir John Reith to his shareholders about half an hour   later.     This, however, might be taken as showing that the Government had been acting in close consultation with the Company and might makesubsequent negotiations more difficult.THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR AIR said that he agreed with the procedure now proposed by theChancellor of the Exchequer.In reply to a question by the Lord Chancellor,the Secretary of State said that if there wasdifficulty in settling the sum to be paid for theacquisition of the existing undertakings of imperial airways and British Airways, the matter would bereferred to arbitration.It was suggested that it might be possibleto deal with the matter by Private Notice question on Friday.The Cabinet agreed:-(a) To authorise the preparation oflegislation to set up theproposed Corporation and togive the Treasury power to guarantee both the principaland interest on its stocks.(b) That the terms of the proposed announcement to be made in theHouse of Commons on 10th or ilthNovember should be agreed betweenthe Chancellor of the Exchequer andthe Secretary of State for Air.
ARMQTJREDFIGHTINGVEHICLES .Provision ofa PracticeRange for.FR.l(scft sr.9.        The Cabinet had under consideration a Memo-randura by the Secretary of State for War (C.P,-244(38)) informing his colleagues of the intention topurchase, at an approximate cost of  2^0,000, a site of 6,000 acres at Linney Head, Pembrokeshire,in order to provide a range for the training of units equipped with armoured fighting vehicles.An unfavourable reaction on the part of the public might be expected&quot;, but the proposed site was theonly possible one in Great Britain that would meet requirements .THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR, in introducing the Memorandum, said that whilstobjections had been raised to the oourse proposedno suitable alternative had been suggested.     Theneed for the range was incontrovertible.     Havingregard, however, to the likelihood of public controversy on the subject he had thought it rightto bring the matter before his colleagues..  THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said thathe had a personal knowledge of this piece ofGoast which was one of the most beautiful andunspoiled places in these Islands.     If theSecretary of State for War&apos;s proposal was accepted this piece of country would be ruined.     Thiscourse might perhaps be necessary, but he woulddeeply regret it.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND fisheries said he had received many representations on thisproposal and he thought that the Government should
look into the matter tery carefully hefore adecision was reached, having regard to the likelihood of repercussions in Parliament and in the country,A good deal of good agricultural land had &quot;beentaken for war purposes and following on representations made to him the Prime Minister had written toLord Herbert on 25th January, 1938, in the following terms :-&quot;Each Defence Department has established a procedure which will ensure that other interests of national importance shall receive adequate consideration when the selection and development of sites arebeing carried out,&quot;The publication of that letter had done much to reassure public opinion.     If, not-withstanding this procedure, the views of the Ministry of Agricultureand Fisheries were overridden by the Defence Services,it might be urged with some justification that the safeguards indicated in the Prime Minister^ letterwere somewhat illusory.The land in question was one of the best tractsof agricultural land in Wales,     It was 150 feet abovesea level and was suitable for a variety of crops.The land was well maintained by the owner, Lord Cawdor,and contained 18 large farms and 5 small holdings letto the County Council, J  The Ministry of Agricultureand Fisheries would be very loth to see it turned intoa practice range*The proposed acquisition of this land would notbe welcomed.     Lord Cawdor was unwilling to part withthe land.     He had already given the public free access to the whole coast-line.     The Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries referred to the debate which had takenplace on this proposal in the House of Lords on the
15th February.       The Minister ashed whether theacquisition of this particular site was reallyessential?     He found it difficult to believethat if Linney Head did not exist there was no possibility of training tanks in this country.     Itmight be that the Y/ar Office could obtain no other placewhich was quite so good0     Having regard, however, tothe opposition to which the acquisition of this area would give rise he thought that the War Office should put up with some degree of inconvenience and take a lesseligible site.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that inacquiring aerodromes he had experienced much the samedifficulty  as had arisen in this case.     It was alwaysstated that the Air Ministry required the bestagricultural land for aerodromes.     It was constantlyalleged that other areas were just as suitable foraerodromes, but this was not the casec     He thought thatthe people of this country must realise that the needsof defence must be supreme,THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES saidthat the requirements of an aerodrome&apos; were for flat,well drained land, sufficiently fertile to support agrass sward.     This in fact meant good agricultural.land.     He did not, however, see why it should benecessary to take good agricultural land for tanks which,he would have thought, would normally operate on roughland.
THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saiathat he felt great sympathy with the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries.     He thought there must &quot;be someland elsewhere which could be made to serve thispurpose.THE MINISTER OF HEALTH said that the Local town planning Committee had arranged with the owner that thisland should be zoned as a private open space withoutpayment of compensation.     If the land was now to be taken over by   the   War Office under compulsory powers itwould be difficult to get owners to enter into similar arrangements in future and to forego payment ofcompensation.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said that the search for a suitable alternative site had been going on for a year, and every part of the country had beencombed, but nothing else suitable had been found.Unless an area   was discovered in the near future the units could not be properly trained in 1939.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER thought the Duchy might be able to let land temporarily to theWar Office for this purpose.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OF TRADE pointed outthat, in order to enable the War Office to fire out to sea, certain regulations would have to be made affectingthe foreshore and fishing.     The Board of Trade in thismatter had to act in a judicial manner and, while he didnot think that any insuperable objection would be likelyto arise, he thought he should enter a warning that it
could not be taken for granted that regulations couldbe made which would give the V/ar Office all therights they required,THE PRIME MINISTER said he was much concerned about this case.     He thought that if the War Officeproceeded with the acquisition there would be a greatoutcry, so great that the G-overnment might have to reverse their decision and find another site elsewhere.He referred to a previous instance in which this had happened and in which another site had in the end beenfound.     This case, which was well known, might throwsome doubt upon the Secretary of State for War&apos;scontention that there was no alternative site.     Hethought it would be difficult in the circumstances todefend the acquisition of this particular site.After further discussion the Cabinet agreed:-To refer the proposed acquisition by the WarOffice of 6,000 acres at Linney Head as aTank Range for further consideration to aCommittee comprising   -The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence(Chairman)The Secretary of State for War,The Secretary of State for Scotland.The Minister of Health,   .The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.
iRT CREDITS 10.     The Cabinet had before them a Note by theiSLATION.President of the Board of Trade (CP. 249(58))vi ouserence: seeking approval to the preparation, with a viewinet 20(57),conclusion   11),     &apos; to its early introduction, of legislation to amend the Export Guarantees Act, 1937, in respect of thefollowing matters:-(i)   An increase in the limits of guarantees which may at any   time be outstanding:(ii)   An   extension of the Departmentspowers to give guarantees for thepurpose of establishing or encouragingtrade between the United Kingdom andany country.TEE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE saidthat he hoped the Cabinet v/ould give immediateauthority for the preparation of the Bill, notwith-standing the fact that decisions had not been reached on two important matters.     These were, first, thenew limit to be laid down in the Bill:    this would besettled by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and himself in consultation;    secondly, the large question whetherthe Export Credits Guarantee Scheme should be extendedto cover munitions of war.      On this matter a Report hadbeen submitted to the Committee of Imperial Defence.The President added that while the increasein the limit of guarantees which might at any time beoutstanding alone made fresh legislation essential, itwas also very desirable to amend certain provisions ofthe existing Acts wh:.ch were unduly restrictive.Rather complicated cuestions of drafting v/ould be involved.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE colonies said that he wisled to raise another question, namely,if the scope of the Export Credits Scheme should beextended to cov.n? colonial trade with foreign countries,whether carrier out directly or through this country.
The Cabinet agreed -(i)   To approve the preparation of a Billto amend the Export Guaran tees-Jlct,1937, in respect of:-(a) The increase in the limit of guarantees which may at anytime be outstanding;(b) An extension-of the Departmentspower to give guarantees for thepurpose of encouraging trade between the United.Kingdom and any country.(ii) &apos; To take note that the Secretary ofState for the Colonies proposed toraise with the President of the Boardof Trade the question of extending&quot;the scope of the Export credits to Colonial Trade*2-**^-^
11.     The Cabinet had under consideration aMemorandum by the Minister of transport (CP.-248(38)) referring to a proposal in CP .-243 (37)  tobuild a bridge in the neighbourhood of CharingCross.   He had now been informed that the majorityof the London County Council were not convinced, ofthe need for such a bridge, and his approval hadbeen sought to the Council&apos;s proposals ^or thedevelopment of the area South of the River between    /.the County Hall and Waterloo Bridge.    In his replyhe proposed, if his colleagues  concurred,&quot;To inform the London County council that, as it is  clear that in existingcircumstances the scheme for a CharingCross bridge is not likely to be practicable within a measurable period,the Government do not propose to ask the London County Council to hampertheir s cheme for the development and improvement of the ares, on the South Bank by requiring, as a condition ofa grant from the Road Fund, that thereshould be provided, a line of approach to a nep bridge at Chafing Cross&quot;.THE MINISTER OF TRANSPORT said thatCharing Cross Bridge would be a major trafficmeasure.      The cost would be between  13 and  30millions, and the approaches would have to startas far back as the Euston Road.     He thought thatif the scheme was not a practical propositionwithin a measurable time, he could not justify thecontinued sterilization of property to keep open the line of the bridge and its approaches.     At thepresent time he was working very harmoniously withMr. Morrison on the southern approaches to waterloo bridge.     The London County Council had an attractive plan to build an embankment on thesouthern bank of the Thames.     There was no difficultyas regards the plans or the rate of grant, but the
question arose whether he (the Minister ^f Transport)must insist upon this scheme being planned so as to fit in with the Charing Cross Bridge scheme.     while there had always been a considerable volume of opinion in favour of the Charing Cross Bridge scheme, everyspecific scheme had met with strong opposition, and hehad come to the conclusion that there was no chance ofthe bridge being constructed within 10 years&apos; time.Indeed, the v/hole question was so problematical thathe thought that the continued sterilization of propertyon the line of the bridge could not be justified.THE PRIME MINISTER expressed general assent to this view.In the course of discussion the SECRETARY of state FOR WAR referred to the difficulties of reachingnorth London from the Charing Cross area, and thought itwas a pity to release the restrictions on the developmentof the line of the bridge even if we could not build thebridge in the near futurecTHE MINISTER OP LABOUR expressed his regret at the present proposal and said that he attached importance to keeping open the line for one really goodroad for north and south traffic.     He did not see how a satisfactory northern approach to Waterloo Bridgecould even be constructed.In this connection, the MINISTER OP TRANSPORTreferred to the importance of not attracting traffic tothe centre of London which ought to go round London bythe North Circular Road.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL thought that there was onoconsideration which ought not to be left altogether outof account.     When the Government came to consider thequestion of underground shelters, they might find therewas no oscape from incurring considerable expenditure on- 23 -
this object.     It was possible that a great undergoundpassage running from north to south through London,connected with other underground structures-, might usefully be employed to serve two purposes.THE PRIME MINISTER said that while he appreciated the force of the objections raised, hethought the real question was, not whether the bridgewas likely to be built within 10 years, but whether itwas ever likely to be builta     On the whole, he thoughtthat the Cabinet should accept the Minister of Transport&apos;proposals.The Cabinet agreed:To authorise the Minister of transport to communicate with the London CountyCouncil as proposed in his memorandum(CP. 248 (38)).
12.     The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and. theSecretary of State for Scotland (Ho .-33 (38))covering the draft Milk Industry Bill, the principalobjects of which were the establishment of a MilkCommission and of a Milk Advisory Committee;   the encouragement of the production of quality milk?the authorisation of payments from the exchequer in respect of milk sold at reduced prices and inrespect of milk used in manufacturing butter and cheese?    the regulation of imports of milk and milk products in order to secure the stability ofthe United kingdom market;    and. the improvedorganisation of the milk distributive service:together with the following recommendation thereon by the Committee of Home Affairs (H.A.C. 15th Con-elusions (38) Minute l) :-&quot;To authorise the introduction forthwith in the House of Commons of the milk industry Bill in the form of the draftannexe-1 to HCA0-33 (38), subject to thesettlement of the outstanding points mentioned in the course of the discus-sion, and subject also to any otherdrafting or minor alterations thatmay be found necessary or desirable.&quot;After some introductory remarks by the LordChancellor, THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIESreferred to the provision in Part V of the Billconfering on the Board of Trade power to collectinformation in connection, inter alia, &quot;with any international arrangements for controlling the exportof milk or milk products into the United Kingdom&quot;.The President of the Board of Trade felt that theinclusion of this provision might be taken to imply that the Government had decided in advance that support would be given to a producers&apos; commodity council,for the regulation of imports of, say, butter.     TheMinister said that he was quite willing for it to be puton record that he agreed that the inclusion of thisprovision in the Bill did not imply that the Governmentwas committed in advance to approval of a scheme on theselines.     Any such scheme would have to be considered onits merits.

The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and theSecretary of State for Scotland (H9 .-33 (38))covering the draft Milk Industry Bill, the principalobjects of which were the establishment of a MilkCommission and of a Milk Advisory Committee;    the encouragement of the production of quality milk?the authorisation of payments from the exchequer in respect of milk sold at reduced prices and inrespect of milk used in manufacturing butter and cheese?    the regulation of imports of milk and milk products in order to secure the stability ofthe United ^insdom market;    and the improvedorganisation of the milk distributive service:together with the following recommendation thereon by the Committee of Home Affairs (H.A.C. 16th Con-elusions (38) Minute l):-&quot;To authorise the introduction forthwith in the ^.ouse of Colons of the milk industry Bill in the form of the draftannexe-1 to HeA0-3&quot; (38), subject to thesettlement of the outstanding points mentioned in the course of the discus-sion, and subject also to any otherdrafting or minor alterations thatmay be found necessary or desirable.&quot;
AgrtrctETCuTS aiitt&apos;Pij,lnayioo oggeoe. iu wftwttasq Lullscheme on thasc lines,    rrtiiy ocrrh uuhuiuu mixaiy &quot;boTHE LORD PRESIDENT OP THE COUNCIL said, that hehsdhoped that the proposed Bill would help to cleardoubts and relieve some of the anxiety felt in thecountry as to the activities of the Milk MarketingBoard.     He referred to the fact that the licensingdecisions of the Board might destroy the goodwill of an existing business.     It was also the case that   a person aggrieved by decisions of the Boardv/ould have no right of appeal to the Courts ofLaw aThe Lord President also referred to the factthat the Milk Marketing Board, which was a judicialbody, was also a trading concern with a large numberof factories.     He thought that this was a somev/hatundesirable combination of functions  which should if possible, be terminated.The Lord President said that, while he appreciated that it v/as probably too late to effectany change in the scope of the Bill, he wished toenter a protest against the tendency of this legislation.THE MINISTER OP AGRICULTURE AND fisheries said   that the functions of the Milk MarketingBoard had been settled   as part of the code ofagricultural legislation enacted by the previous government, of which he had not been a member.The Board1 s factories had the right to marketmilk and to allocate it to the most remunerativechannels.     Owing to the shortage of milk in the summer, the Milk Marketing Board, instead of sending milk to creameries, had sold it to thosewho were prepared to pay a better price for it,- 26 -
9 n e.g-as liquid milk. Many of the troubles of the milk industry arose from the fact that weimported large quantities of butter and cheeseat prices below those obtaining in the countries of origin.In reply to a question as to the receptionwhich the Bill had received from the interestswho had been consulted, the Minister said thatthe reaction of the distributors had, on thewhole, been favourable.     They were interestedin getting   a larger turn-over, and they wantedpower to organise themselves.     The producersthought that there was nothing of value to themin the Bill except the proposed Milk Subsidies.The   Milk Marketing Board were critical of theBill, mainly on the ground that a Commissioncomposed of independent persons was to be putover them.      This,they argued, interfered with theprinciple of producer control.      The smallproducer-retailers had received false reports as to the Bill, but he thought their reactionwould not be too unfavourable when they knewits real contents.The Minister also referred to Part VII,which provided for Pasteurisation Orders underlocal option.     This would not have much effect in London, where 98 per cent, of milk waspasteurised, but might lead to some controversy in the Provinces.     There was a long historybehind this matter, and the present proposalsrepresented a compromise.

APPENDIX.PALESTINE.QUESTION.To ask the Secretary of State for the Colonieswhether he has any further statement to make regardingthe arrangements for the proposed discussions inLondon on the Palestine question.ANSWER.Yes, Sir.    As was announced in the statement which His Majesty&apos;s Government published yesterday,it is proposed to invite representatives of the palestinian Arabs and of neighbouring States on the onehand and of the Jewish Agency on the other.    It ishoped to include representatives from Egypt, Iraq,Saudi-Arabia and Trans-Jordan, and we are also in communication on the matter with the King of the yemen.Other territories which, by reason of theircontiguity, are interested in the Palestine questionnaire Syria and the Lebanon.    They are under Frenchmandatory control, and consequently stand on a different footing.    It is not proposed that representatives ofthese territories should be invited to the discussions,but His Majesty&apos;s Government intend to keep closely intouch with the French Government and to keep theminformed of any developments which may be of interestto Syria and the Lebanon.,
With, regard to the representation of the palestinian Arabs, I am in consultation with the HighCommissioner, and I am not at present in a positionto indicate what arrangements will be made.    TheHouse will have observed that the Government reserve the right to refuse to receive leaders whom they regard as responsible for the campaign of assassinationand violence.    I should say that- His Majesty5sGov-ernment-have -decided that they cannot accept the mufti of Jerusalem as a representative.    In view of hisrecord over many years His Majesty&apos;s Government wouldhave no confidence in him.    V/ith regard to others I canadd nothing further at present.    The matter must dependon developments in Palestine.His Majesty&apos;s Government made It clear in thestatement which they issued yesterday that they willcontinue their responsibility for the government of thewhole of Palestine,,    Their ultimate aim is to givelasting. pea^-and^prospeo^lty;..to^&quot;&quot;1Jie people of &quot;the country&quot;]their immediate duty is to establish law and orderthroughout the land.    They earnestly hope that they will secure the early co-operation of the Arab people ofPalestine in promoting the state of peace which is so important for the success of the policy of negotiationwhich has been announced.    The Arabs of Palestine are nowoffered an opportunity of coming to London in company with representatives of neighbouring countries to enterInto free and full discussions on the problem of
Palestine with His Majesty&apos;s Government.    In thesecircumstances His Majesty&apos;s Government will expect that rebellious activities should be brought to an end.If they do not cease His Majesty&apos;s Government must continue to take all such measures as may be necessaryto put an end to disorder.
