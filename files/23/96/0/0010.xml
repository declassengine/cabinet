1.        On the question of Assistance to China, theCabinet again hart before them the following doou-ments  (a) A Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs (CP.-266 (3g) ;(b) A Memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer (CP^-268 (38))  on which a decision had been postponed pending theresult of the enquiries agreed upon in the conclusion mentioned in the margin.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that, in accordance with the decision inquestion, an approach had been made to the UnitedStates Charge d&apos;Affaires asking for an expression ofthe United States Government&apos;s views as to the proposed guarantee of  3 millions to the Hong-Kong andShanghai Bank.     On the instructions of the PrimeMinister, a telegram had also been despatched toSir Ronald Lindsay informing him of this approach and asking him to get in touch with the State department at Washington (Telegram No. 853 to Washington).A telegram had also been despatched to sir robert Craigie asking for a somewhat more preciseexpression of his views on the proposal.     Hisanswer was contained in telegram No. 1432.The Secretary of State also drew attention to0telegram No. 1435, which set out the views of our military Attachd at Tokyo, which were to the effectthat Japan might regard a loan to assist the Chinesecurrency as a definite and overt unfriendly act.It was understood.^ however, that the MilitaryAttaches views were not shared by other officials in the Embassy at Tokyo.
The Secretary of State thought that in the circuit-stances it was now necessary to await a reply from theUnited States Government. The meeting of theKuomintang had now been postponed for some   we^kB,and we therefore had a little longer time in which toconsider the matter.In the course of discussion it was generally agreedthat for this country to act alone in this matter would be an entirely different proposition from thiscountry and the United States taking parallel action.The view was also expressed that denunciation of our Commercial Treaty with Japan might well result inconsiderable inconvenience for this country, and that trade retaliation was likely to prove a dangerousweapon.The Cabinet agreed -To postpone a decision in regard tothe proposals set out in the Memo-randum by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs (CP.  266(38))pending a reply to the enquiriesmade of the United States Government.
ANGLO-ITALIANDELATIONS.(previous reference:Cabinet 57(38), Con-clusion 7.)FR. iC*l)12. THE PRIME MINISTER informed the Cabinet thata telegram had been sent to the Earl of Perthinstructing him to make representations to count ciano as to the demonstration which had  iaksnplace in the Italian Chamber, when there had beenshouts of &quot;Corsica, Tunis aid Nice&quot; (telegrams nos.  508 to Rom&apos;? and 731 from Rome)o    Count Cianohad replied that these outbursts had been entirelyspontaneouso   Wl en asked whether he woulddissociate himself publicly from this demonstrationhe had replied that this would be contrary to theItalian Government&apos;s practice.We had thus not obtained any very definiteresult, but at least we had been able to saypublicly that we had made representations.The Cabinet took note of thePrime Minister&apos;s Statement.9-3-
3.     THE PRIME MINISTER reported that, in accor-dance v/ith the Conclusion mentioned in the margin,the Foreign Policy Committee had considered a draft telegram to the British Minister at Prague instruet-&apos;ing him to invite the views of the czechoslovak government as to the form of the proposed guarantee.The Foreign Policy Committee had decided that the telegram should he re-drafted in the light of thediscussion v/hich had taken place.One new factor had influenced the Committeein reaching this decision.     This v/as the possibility that Germany and Italy might now announce that theyhad given their guarantee to Czechoslovakia, without consulting this country or France.     Such action wouldnot be in   accordance with the spirit of the Munich agreement and would put&quot; us in an av/kward position, since we were unwilling to see the guarantor Powers divided up into  twoopposing bloc So   It was therefore thought necessary toask Mr. Newton to bear this possibility in mind andto indicate to the Czechoslovak Government that ifthey agreed to any such arrangement we might have to reconsider our position.     Generally it v/as hopedthat Mr, Newton would obtain a free expression (ifthis was possible) of the viev/s of the Czecho-Slovak Government, and that we would then approachGermany and Italy in order to put the whole question on a satisfactory footing.The Cabinet took note of the PrimeMinister&apos;s statement.
ZECHOSLOVAKIA.rant ofinane ial,Assistance to.previous reference:Cabinet 57(38)Conclusion 3.)4. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER reported tothe Cabinet that, in accordance with, the conclusionnoted in the margin, this natter had been consideredby the Foreign Policy Committee   at a meeting onthe previous day0     The advance of  10 millions which the Bank of England had been authorised tomake to the Czechoslovak Government had now been paid out to that Government.     It was desirablethat action should be taken as early as possible to regularise the position with the Bank of England byobtaining the requisite legislative authority.Action, however, had necessarily been postponed byconsideration of the questions, first, whether itwas proposed to give any further measure offinancial assistance to Czechoslovakia, and,secondly, in what manner the Czechoslovak Govern-ment proposed to raise the money on the london market to repay the advance.      The French Govern-ment were of course, also concerned in this matter.On the previous day, a message had beenreceived from the   French Government.     The french had now confirmed that they were prepared to relieve the Czechoslovak Government of the responsibilityof providing interest and repayment on the GuaranteedCzechoslovak Loan issued in 1932 amounting to 700million francs - the present day equivalent of  4 million,      (Cabinet 55(58) Conclusion 7).     If theFrench took this action, it was desirable that thiscountry should take some corresponding action andregard ZA millions of the advance which had been madeas a gift.     Thi^ would leave  6 millions of the advance to be reps.id by a loan to be issued on theLondon market by the Czechoslovak Government with ajoint and several guarantee from ourselves and the
French Government and on the understanding that 50 percent, of any money required to implement the - guaranteewould he found by each Government.   This proposal wouldmean a somewhat less generous measure of financialassistance   than the Cabinet had authorised three weeksearlier when it had been agreed that we should treat  millions of our advance as&apos; a gift and that this countryand the French should give a joint and several guarantee for a loan of  10 millions.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he v/assatisfied that the position had changed considerably andthat there was now no case for giving assistance to czechoslovakia on the more liberal scale.     He also referred to the diffieulty which he night findin meetingother claims on the Exchequer if the original proposal in regard to Czechoslovakia stood unaltered (Cabinet55(38) Conclusion 7).The next step would be for representatives ofthe Czechoslovak and the French Governments to come and discuss the matter in London.     This meant that it wasimpossible for legislation to be introduced immediately.The Chancellor thought, however, that a bill could bereadv to be presented to the House of Commons before itrose and could be taken as the first business after the recess.The Chancellor of the Exchequer also mentioned &apos;that Mr. Stopford who had been in Prague had informed him that pressure had been brought to bear on the Czecho-slovak Government to use as large a proportion of the advance as possible for the relief of Refugees.    large sums had been directly earmarked for this purpose, andit could, of course, be argued the use of the money for more general purposes, e.g. in order to avoid economiccollapse of the country, did, in effect, help to preventthe Refugee question from being more serious.     Mr.Stopford was now coming home to make a report.-(3 ***
The Chancellor of the Exchequer added that,on the Home Secretary&apos;s suggestion, a telegram hadVeen sent to our Minister in Prague to the effectthat the British Government t ook a strong interestin the position of refugees, including Jev/ishrefugees, and leaking it plain that this country would he considerably influenced by the attitudeof the Czechoslovak Government in this matter.He proposed to try to retain by means of the grant    ,of financial assistance to Czechoslovakia some holdover the Czechoslovak Government&apos;s behaviour inthis respect.The Cabinet agreed:-(a) That, in the circumstances described,legislation to deal with this matter as a whole could not be passed before Christmas, but that thenecessary Bill should, if possible,be introduced in the House of commons before the Adjournment in order thatthe Second Reading might be taken as soon as parliament reassembled afterthe Christmas Recess.(b) That the Chancellor of the exchequer should be authorised to discuss thematter with the French and Czechoslovakrepresentatives on the revised basisnow indicated,&quot; namely -(i)    That of the advance of 10 millions,  4 millions should be treated as a gift.(ii)    That this country and theFrench should give a jointand several guarantee ofa loan of  6 millions to beraised on the London marketon the understanding that50 per cent, of any money required to implement theguarantee would be found by each Government.    This loan of  6 millions would be usedto repay an equivalent portionof the advance of  10 millions.
9 /q, 0c5 i wPAIN,itish CharterGeneralfranco *previous reference:cabinet 57 (38)Conclusion 5)5.      TIE SECRET-RY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that his colleagues were aware that the greek ships referred to at the previous week&apos;s cabinet had now been released,.Most of the ships which had been charteredto carry to this country the purchases of Roumanianwheat   were Greek ships.     A list of these ships hadbeen given to General Franco who had promised not tointeref ere with them.     The Admiralty had also beeninformed of the movements of these ships and had undertaken to take such action as was possible toprotect themeThe Foreign Secretary added that theParliamentary Under-Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs was being much pressed on this matter by theOpposition, who were enquiring whether we were preparedto act in consultation v/ith other Governments in orderto take steps to check the illegal exercise of belligerent rights by General Franco,,     TheParliamentary Under-Secretary proposed to state thatwe were in touch with the Governments concerned,but that we proposed to await the receipt of atelegram from our Agent at Burgos stating whether he had been able to reach any understanding with theNationalist authorities.     It was also suggested thatwe might say that, where there was a purely british interests in the cargo, we shoxtld protect the ships and demand their release if they were arrested.THE FIRST LORE OF THE ADMIRALTY said thatthe Admiralty were aot altogether happy about thelatter half of the proposed Answer, since they feared that if, at some future date, we were engaged in war,it might be embarrassing if some powerful neutral
country were to protest against our seizing foreign ships on the grounds that jart of the cargo in such ships &quot;belonged to ohe neutral country concerned.In the course of the discussion which ensued,it was suggested that the fact that General Francohad not been accorded belligerent rights would prevent any action in the present case from constituting a precedent.TillJ LORD CIIiuICELiiCR said that, according to the experts on international lav/, this was not the .case.The action of General Franco in stopping Greek shipswas illegal, but he v/as not satisfied that in ordinarycircumstances it was any business of this country to demand the release of Greek ships.      It was agreed,however, that there were two circumstances whichdistingu i shed the position of the ships now inquestion from other cases; viz.first, that they hadbeen chartered by the British Government and secondly, that they contained nothing except goodspurchased by the British Goveminenta     On the basisof these two facts taken together, v/e could safelyjustify action to secure that there v/as nointereference with the ships in question.It was agreed -That the Foreign Secretary andthe First Lord of the admiralty should frame a reply to begiven in the House of commons on the lines indicated inthe discussion.

EE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ThE DOMINIONSAH) COLONIES said that military operations were proceeding according to plan.     In recent weeksheavy casualties had been inflicted on rebelforces.In reply to t-.e Secretary of State for India,the Secretary of State for the Dominions and colonies said that Ms general impression was that althoughacts of sabotage continued, they were on a reduced scale.     he mentioned that control had now been &apos;regained of the Jerusalem-Jaffa railway and that therailway would be re-opened in about a monthrs time.The Secretary of State said that he proposedto announce that afternoon that formal acceptanceskgpi;had been received from/Iraq, Saudi-Arabia,Trans Jordan! a and the Jewish Agency.   The fivedeportees from Palestine in the Seychelles were to be released so that they Might be available for consultation.     They would not, however, be allowedto return to Palestine.     At least one of thedeportees v/ould be required to attend the london conference.The Secretary of State for the Dominionsand Colonies said that King Ibn Saud had been intouch with the Mufti, and had exercised a moderatinginfluence.     King .Ibn Saud had put forward a list offive representatives who might be described asextremists.The Secretary of State proposed that atelegram should be sent to King Ibn Saud to theeffect that it was desirable that the delegation should include representatives of different views, andthat the list would be subject to criticism inPalestine if no other names were included.
It had been, suggested to the Secretary ofState that he should reserve the right for theGovernment to nominate additional representativesthemselves.     He was opposed to this view for threereasons:    first, if we adopted this course, therewas a risk that the five representatives putforward by Xing Ibn Saud would refuse to attend;secondly, there would be a risk of offending Ibn Saud;and tnirdly, any persons nominated by this country would be suspect and their influence would thereby be rendered of little value.     Further, he thought there was something to be said for the presenceat the Conference of a number of extremists, who,he hoped, would come under the moderating influence of representatives of the neighbouring Arab States,nevertheless he proposed to endeavour to getIbn Saud to add to his list the names of one or twomoderates.      It would, of course, be made clearthat the representatives of the Palestinian ^rabshad not been chosen by us and that the matter had been left to Ibn Saud and the otherneighbouring Arab States, in consultation withthe Palestinian Arabs themselves.The Secretary of State said that the attorney General in Palestine had now carriedout an enquiry as to the allegations that fourpolicemen had murdered an Arab prisoner, and had reported that there was a prima facie case forprosecution for murder.     The four policemen had been arrested on Monday and would be charged with murder.
The Secretary of State for the Dominions and colonies said that he deeply deplored thisunfortunate incident which would no doubt injureour reputation considerably, although the fact thatwe were determined to deal sternly with thecase might to some extent mitigate the damage.If the four men were found guilty, the lav/ mustrtake its course.The Cabinet took note of theSecretary of State&apos;s statement.
EXPORT CREDITSLEGISLATION.(previous reference:Cabinet *v4(38)? Con-clua ion 10 *)7. The Cabinet had before them the following documents on the subject cf Export Credits Legisla-tion:-(a)(b)A Memorandum by the President of theEo^rd of Trade ( CP.-277 (38))  coheringa Bill (for introduction as soon as ithas been approved by the Committee ofHome Affair? and without further refer-ence to the Cabinet) to amend the Export-Guarantees Act on the lines already approved by the Cabinet in C.P.-241- (38),with the addition of further provisionsmaking arrangements for (a) the grantof credits for exports to foreigncountries in cases where credits couldnot be arranged through the Export ,Credits Scheme?    (b) modification ofthe reference to &quot;munitions of war&quot;;and (c) the availability of export creditguar^nte^s in respect of re-exports of colonial goods from this  country up toa. limited amount:A Memorandum by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence (CP.-260 (38))circulating ^or the information of hiscolleagues a Memorandum by the Presidentof the Board of Trade (CT.D. PaperNo.1480-3), together with the relevantextract from the 338th Meeting of theCommittee of Imperial Defence (Minute 6).at which it v/as agreed, inter alia,that in the interests o^ Imperial &quot;Defenceit was important to increase the exportof armaments to foreign countries.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE said thathe was asking the Cabinet to authorise the immediate.introduction of the Bill as soon as the draft had beenapproved by the Home Affairs Committee and withoutfurther reference to the Cabinet.      There were two reasons for urgency:    first,  -one desire to give anearly answer to the Chinese about their order forlorries.     In this matter the urgency was somewhat lessthan previously owing to the postponement of theKuomintang;    secondly, the Chief Whip was anxious
that the Bill should he introduced as soon as possible,as there was some difficulty in making use of theavailable Parliamentary time before Christmas.The President of the Board of Trade reminded hiscolleagues that the Cabinet had already approved theintroduction of an Export Credits Bill to deal withcertain questions of machinery, and to increase thetotal amount of guarantees outstanding at any time.Discussions at the Committee of Imperial Defence and at last week&apos;s meeting of the Cabinet showed that in anumber of cases, although a credit would not perhaps bejustified on a strictly commercial basis, neverthelessif the matter were looked at from a political point ofview,  it might well be desirable that the credits shouldbe granted notwithstanding the commercial risk involved.It had, therefore, been agreed that he should discussthe matter with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and he expressed his gratitude to the Chancellor for thepromptitude with which he had dealt with the matter andmet his views.The President then explained the variousprovisions in the draft Bill.      He thought that theproposal in Clause 3 authorising the grant of credits bythe Board of Trade, with the consent of the Treasury,without consultation with the Exports Credits AdvisoryCouncil, would be subject to some criticism in the House.The Opposition would be suspicious that credits were tobe made available fox Italy or for Nationalist Spain.He proposed to meet this criticism by the provision in clause 5(2) as to six-monthly returns.
In conclusion, the President of the Board ofTrade said that, when the Bill was passed, there would no doubt he a flood of applications, and he suggestedthat the Foreign Office should he asked to determinewhich were the countries which it was most desirablewe should help.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE DOMINIONS and colonies, while grateful for the concession made forthe Colonies,  said that he wished to raise two points:first that the provision referred to in paragraph 5 of cp.  277 (38) would appear to be drawn in terms whichwould be applicable not merely to Colonies and newfoundland, hut also to foreign countries.      In thesecond place, he wondered whether it would he possiblew^e&quot;*&quot; J^Lj^T^i i ^0 ex*en(* &apos;^Cie scope of the scheme to Colonial goodsX^il^ct^u^^\ which went direct from a Colony to a foreign country^THE PRESIDENT OP THE 30ARD OF TRADE, in reply tothe first point, said that it was the ixrtentian thettbe prct&amp;efcwa.referred to should be limited to the   re-export of Colonialgoods from this country.     He thought, however, that itwould be preferable that the provision should stand inits present general form, since there might be exceptional cases in which it was desired to use the powers givenin this Clause in respect of re-exports from someforeign country.As regards the second suggestion, he pointedout that the main object of the Export credits guarantee Scheme was to facilitate the sale abroad ofUnited Kingdom manufactures, and that to cut into that principle to any large extent in favour of our entrepot
trade would be very unfavourably received.    He undertook to look into the points raised by the Secretary of Statefor the Dominions and Colonies, but he was bound to saythat he doubted whether it would be possible for himto make any further concessions.1iiat he v/as grateful to the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the President of the Board of Trade for having putforward a proposal v/hich went so far to meet the case which he and some of his colleagues had urged.     he agreed that the Treasury, the Foreign Office and theBoard of Trade should settle the foreign countries whichit was most necessary should be helped.lorries v/hich the Chinese Government had in mind to orderfrom Messrs. Thorneycroft.    It was explained that althoughit was hoped the Second Reading would be passed before christmas, it would not be possible to pass the bill into law before the Recess.see a representative of Messrs. Thorneycroft and explain to him that if the Bill passed into law the Governmentwould be prepared to look favourably on the grant of a credit in this case.     The final decision, however, must rest with Messrs. Thorneycroft, since the Governmentcould give no undertaking that the Bill would pass into law in its present form.   TZa.

5r;g35i)VAL COURTSf JUSTICE.Rate of Businessh the King&apos;sfench Division.previous reference:fpabinet 171(38), Con-conclusion 9.)9.     The Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumby the Lord Chancellor (G.P.-27G (38)) drawing attention to the congested state of business inthe King&apos;s Bench Division and at Assizes, and recommending that Resolutions should be presented to Parliament for the appointment of two additional judges of the King&apos;s Bench Division, thus bringing the total of the puisne Judges of that Division to19, as it was in 1935.THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that since theKing&apos;s Bench Division had ceased to comprise 19 puisnejudges,, arrears in the Division had steadilyincreased, and there was now also great congestion in the Assize Courts.     It was true that threeadditional Lords Justices had been appointed (this increase being in part counter-balanced by reductionof one in the number of judges in the ChanceryDivision) and that these additional Lords Justiceshad been giving help in the King&apos;s Bench Divisionwhen they were not sitting in the Third Courtof Appeal.     It was clear, however, that theexisting number of judges could not keep the workdown.The Lord Chancellor added that the position might be improved if steps were taken to reduce thenumber of cases which came into the Courts inconnection with motor car accidents.     The increaseproposed was not a permanent increase in the Judiciarysince on the occurrence of vacancies, the numberscould be reduced.The Cabinet agreed:That resolutions should be presented toParliament under Section 11 of theSupreme Court of Judicature (Consolidation)Act, 1925,  (as amended by the SupremeCourt of Judicature (Amendment) Act, 1935),for the appointment of two additional judges of the King&apos;s Bench Division,bringing the total of the puisne judges of that Division^bo 19, as it was in 1935.
PENS IONS POR-     10-       The Prime Minister raised the question ofMEMBERS OPPARLIAMENT.       Pensions for Members of Parliament, on which the  - -following Papers had already been circulated to the(previous reference:       Cabinet:-Cabinet 32(38), Con- (a) A Memorandum by the Prime Minister,elusion 15.) covering the Report of a Departmental. Committee (CoP.-307 (37)):(bcf)f.(b) A Memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer (CaP.-165 (38)):( c) A Memorandum by the Chancellor of theExcheauer covering a draft Bill( CcP.-168 (38)) .The PRIME MINISTER referred to an Answerwhich he had given on this matter in Parliament onthe 21st July, 1938 (Hansard, Vol.  338, Ho. 153,Col.  2427) as follows -&quot;The Government have had this matter under consideration, but it is notpossible to deal with it at thisstage of the Parliamentary Session.Further consideration will be givento the question during the Recess,and I hope to be in a position to make an announcement early in the autumii.&quot;No definite pledge had thus been given thatthe Government would introduce legislation in thepresent Session to give effect to the report of theDepartmental Committee (Cmda 5624)*The Prime Minister explained that he had now received a memorial signed by 200 Members ofParliament, supporters of the Government, opposingany scheme for the grant of pensions to formerMembers of Parliament.     In these circumstances, hethought that it would be unwise for the Governmentto proceed with the matter as a Government measure,as had been intended   at a time when it was thoughtthat opinion in the House of Commons v/as in favour of
the scheme.       After discussing the matter v/ith theChief &apos;/hip, he proposed that the matter should he discussed on the motion of a Private Member, forexample, Sir Assheton Pownall, who had identified himself with the proposals in the Departmental Committee&apos;s report.He (the Prime Minister) would state his personal viewson the matter, and would make it plain that his viewsbound nobody, and that the matter would he left to a free vote of the House.In discussion, THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUERreferred to the difficulties which he had had inobtaining a clear indication of the views of government supporters on this matter last July, and the view was generally expressed that feeling in the meantime hadhardened against the-proposal-The Cabinet agreed -That arrangements should be made forthe proposed scheme for pensions ofMembers of the House of Commons to he discussed on a Private Member&apos;s motion,and that the question should be left toa free vote of the House.
o jo11.       The Cabinet had before them the following documents on the Barley anci Oats situation:-(a) A Memorandum by the Minister of Agri-culture and Fisheries (CP. 273 (38))reviewing the Barley position and seeking approval in principle to a&quot;distress&quot; grant, as an interim measure pending the working out andputting into effect of long-term proposals designed to prevent are currence of the present crisisconditions in the barley industry.The figure suggested by the minister was a total of  1 peracx^e in respectof the acreage of barley which hadqualified for subsidy this year;    andto give barley growers who have elected to receive the wheat subsidy instead ofthe oats and barley subsidy an opportunity-nity to reconsider their decision.     Thisproposal was expected to involve an expenditure not exceeding  400,000(including  100,000 payable unaer theexisting provisions of the agriculture act):(b) A Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Scotland (CP. 279 (38)), drawing attention to the present situation inregard to Oats (particularly in Scotland,where the oat crop was of greater import-ance than in England and Wales), and theeffect thereon of the subsidy proposals contained in CP. 273 (38)*      The Secretaryof State urged that the position of oats and barley should be considered at thesame time.THE MINISTER OP AGRICULTURE iHiD fisheries said that, after anxious enquiry, he was satisfiedthat there was ground for the grant of immediate assistance to the barley-growers.     One essentialfact in the situation was that the cultivation of barley and sheep-farming were to a large extentassociated^ ana that, over and above the drop inbarley prices there had been continued depressionin sheep and lamb prices.      In Norfolk, sugar-beet,which was the third main source of revenue of theagricultural community, had also had a bad year.agricultural policy.Barley.Oats.(previous reference:Cabinet 25(37), Con-elusion 1.)
He was satisfied that unless some action v/as taken,there v/ould he bankruptcies on a wide scale and land would go out of cultivation.As regards the long-term plan, he v/asproposing to have a meeting between the brewers, thegrowers and the maltsters to discuss plans for a-trade agreement/to secure greater stability ofprices.     These discussions, however, would not help the present crisis, and he was satisfied that theleast action which he could take would be &quot;the grantof assistance on the lines set out in paragraph 24of Part III of his Memorandum.     These proposals wouldinvolve an additional expenditure of  300,000 overand above the grants payable under the existing provisions of the Agriculture Act 1937.      Ascompared v/ith this sum, the demand put forward by theConservative Agricultural Committee would costapproximately  1 million.The Minister said that if his proposal was accepted, he would be criticised on the ground thathe v/as continuing the principle of the agriculture act that a farmer could not receive a subsidy inrespect of both wheat and barley, and that he was not proposing to offer assistance to all barley-growers.His proposal, was intended to help the barley-growerson the light lands and upland districts.     He felt,however, that barley-growers who had elected toreceive the wheat subsidy instead of the oats orbarley subsidy, must be given an opportunity to reconsider their decision.
&quot;h^ja^s-^- ^Lc-t^ptollt!hThe Minister then referred to tne Memorandumhy the Secretary of State for Scotland (CP. 279 (38))in v/hich it v/as urged that nothing should he done forbarley unless some concession v/as also given tooat-growers o   The Agriculture Act had been &quot;based onthe assumptions (a) that malting barley wouldordinarily fetch a satisfactory price and thatgrowers of malting barley would normally grow afair average of wheat;    (b) that assistance was required for farmers who can grow only feeding barley and whose land is not generally suitable for v/heat.It was for the latter reason that the barleysubsidy had been linked with the price of oats.But this season&apos;s experience showed that these assumptions did not always work.    It would not,of course, be true to say that a concession tobarley would not help Scotland.   Actually theproportion of barley grown in Scotland correspondedalmost exactly to the &quot;Goschen&quot; proportion/&apos;The Minister then r ead an extract from a letter which he had received from Captain McEwen, M.P.,who had been meeting the farmers in his constituency.       It was true that these farmers were asking for subsidies for both oats and barley, butCaptain McEwen had expressed some doubts as to the wisdom of subsidising both crops.The Minister also referred to the fact that inthe case of oats there was a prohibitive tariff andvirtually no imports except small quantities from canada.    In the case of barley, however,  therewas a considerable importation from abroad.
The Minister added that in his view the&apos;serious position in this country was largely due tothe conjunction of the drop in the prices of sheep and of barley.     In Scotland., however, the position was somewhat different, as a quarter of the oatsgrown in Scotlana was grown in Aberdeenshire, andfarmers in that county   had profited from the cattlesubsidy.     He gave figures to show that only 17 percent of the barley acreage in this country wasregistered for subsidy, whereas 78 per cent of theoats acreage in Scotland was so registered.The Minister urged that the Cabinet should authorise him to proceed with the present proposal,and that consideration should be given later to theposition of oats.THE SECRETARY OP STATS FOR SCOTLAND said thatthe Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries&apos; proposalraised a great difficulty for Scotland.      Scottishagriculture must be considered very largely interms of oats and sheep, and the prices for bothwere depressed.     Of the arable land in Scotland,27 per cent was represented by oats, and 3 per cent by wheat, and 3 per cent by barley.     Already theview was held that whereas the wheat farmerreceived a high subsidy, the grower of oats was virtually left out in the cold.     Even assuming a subsidy in the current year of 13/-, Scottish oat-growers would receive a price 19 per cent lower than they received in respect of the harvest of tenyears ago.     The Minister of Agriculture and Fisherieshad made much of the drop in prices in barley,
but if the comparison was pushed back over a longer period the oat-grower had fared worse thanthe grower of barley.Oats was the only crop which, for climaticreasons, could be grown in many parts of Scotland.The position of cattle farmers v/as not altogetherrelevant, since to a considerable extent differentfarmers v/ent in for cattle and oats.    The twocrops, oats and barley, had been dealt withtogether in the Agriculture Act, 1937, and that itwould be impossible to hold the position if a concession was now made to barley alone.   As statedin his Memorandum, the cost of increasing the oatssubsidy to  1 an acre would be  445,000 in respectof the present qualifying acreage.   If it was proposed to give an option to growers to reconsider their decision on a choice between wheat and oats,this might  cost   an additional  200,000j   but he did not favour the giving of this option in thecase of either oats or barley.The Secretary of State for Scotland concluded by saying that public opinion in Scotland was alreadymuch stirred on the oat position, and that he was most unwilling that the Government should put themselves in a position in which they attempted to deal with barley alone, and were later forcedto. make a concession in respect of oats also.
THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said thatwhile he sympathised with the Secretary of Statefor Scotland, it v/as impossible for him to acceptthe view that if some crop failed or pricesdropped, the loss to the farmers should he made good by the general   taxpayer.    The case for thebarley growers, as he saw it, rested on the grounds that they were faced with bankruptcy and that astate of emergency had arisen v/hich must bedealt v/ith.    The Minister of Agricultureproposed that the subsidy for the barley should this year be increased to  1 per acre, on accountof these special circumstances, from the 10s.which would be payable, under the existing statutory provision.    This was a proposition whichhe could appreciate, but it could not be argued that the same treatment should be extended to oats.The Chancellor of the Exchequer also quoted figures to show that barley prices were far below thefigure for the previous year, and 12 per cent,below the average figure for the previous fiveyears;   whilst the price of oats was only 2^ percent, below the average price of the previous fiveyears, and was actually higher than the average price of three of the previous, seven years, inScotland, and four of the previous seven years inEngland.    His conclusion was that a case couldnot be established for any concession to the oatgrowers.THE MINISTER OP HEALTH expressed agreement with the Secretary of State forScotland1 s view that difficulties would ensue
if the basis of the Agriculture Act 1937 were to be upset.The present crisis in prices was not one which would passquickly.      He thought that the whole question requiredvery careful consideration and should be remitted to asmall Committee of Ministers.     He also emphasised thatthe growing of malting barley was necessarily something of a gamble.      If the barley was sold to the brewers,  thegrower received a good price;    otherwise the barley was used as a feeding-stuff and fetched a lower price.      Hethought that most of the assistance now proposed would goto the farmers on the rich lands who had had a bumper crop.Continuing, the Minister of Health said that much time had been spent on working out the Agriculture Act1937 as a means of assisting the upland farmers.     Hethought that it would be very rash to reverse thedecisions implicit in that policy without very carefulconsideration,  and he emphasised that in his view the farmers on the North East coast, who were feeling the strain of the position, would take a very serious view ofthe situation.      It was also pointed out that the pricesquoted oy the Chancellor of the Exchequer were averageprices and had since dropped.      Thus, the price of oatsin Scotland was now about 5/8d. per cwt.THE SECRETARY OR STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS expressed general agreement with the Minister of Health and thoughtthat it would be desirable that the Memoranda before theCabinet should be remitted to a Cabinet Committee.     Fromhis own knowledge,  farmers&apos; sons were now beginning toleave the farming industry, on the grounds of thehopelessness of the position.      In his view the mattermust not be regarded as merely affecting the interests
of producers or landowners.,     The question was whether we v/ere prepared to see the whole country way of lifeextinguished.     The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsadded that whatever help could be given in regard to barleywould be but slight as compared with the help v/hich thefanner could secure if stabilisation of sheep prices at areasonable level could be arranged.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE DOMINIONS and colonies, while agreeing that a decision should be reached at an early date, thought that the matter night perhaps be considered by a Ministerial Committee, as had been proposed.     He said that the matter v/as one v/hich mightwell give rise to/political agitation in certain areasin Scotland.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES said thathe had hoped that it would have been possible to reach adecision on proposals that morning.     He still felt thatbarley should be dealt with separately from oats.      In his view there v/as no question of tearing up the provisions ofthe Agriculture Act v/hich had not applied to malting barley.Further, the fall in barley prices had been much greaterthan the fall in oat prices.      If however it v/as the wishof his colleagues he agreed that the matter should befurther discussed by a Committee of Ministers.After further discussion,  it was agreed:-(i) That the proposals in the Memoranda by theMinister of Agriculture and Fisheries(CP. 273(33)) and by the Secretary ofmffl State for Scotland (CP.  27^(38)) in regardto the barley situation should be remitted to the Committee on Trade and agriculture for consideration and report.(ii) That the Committee should report to the PrimeMinister, who should have authority toauthorise a pronouncement on this matterwithout further reference to the Cabinet.(iii) That the President of the Board of Trade shouldtake the chair at the meetings of the Tradeand Agriculture-Committee held to consider this matter.

The Cabinet had under consideration aJoint Memorandum by the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries ana the Secretary of State forScotland (Co?.  274 (38)) seeking authority inprinciple for the preparation and early introduction of a Dill to give effect to certain amendments to the Bacon Industry Act, moreparticularly in respect of lard prices.    Detailsof the Ministers&apos; proposals v/ere contained in an appendix to their Memorandum.THE MINISTER OP AGRICULTURE ANDFISHERIES said that the terms of the draft bill had been agreed with the Chancellor&quot; of theExchequer.    He hoped that the Cabinet would agree that the concession which was proposed should be based on the wider ground of stabilisingthe curers1  returns from lard rather than uponthe narrower ground of providing compensation to the curer in respect of the removal of theImport Duty on lard.    This latter ground, if adopted, might prove embarrassing in other cases.After a short discussion the cabinet agreed:&apos;To authorise the preparation and early introduction of a Bill togive effect to the proposals setout in the Joint memorandum submitted by the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries and theSecretary of State for Scotland(CP,  274 (38)).-SO-

It was agreed,however, that provided no pressure was brought tobear on the Board of Film Censors to refuse toallow the publication of the film, there couldbe no objection to a Minister of the Crownassuming full responsibility for having expressed
a view as to the results which would he likelyto ensue if the film was   publicly exhibited.The Cabinet approved the action taken by the Secretary of Statefor India in this matter.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1.,7th December, 1938.
