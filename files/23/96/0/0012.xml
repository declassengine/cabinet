CABINET.ureangements.Visit toviouserence:inet 57 (38)holusion 7.)tESTINE.viousference:binet 59 (38)conclusion 6.)lo     THE PRIME MINISTER said that he and the secretary of State for Foreign Affairs were leaving forRome on the 10th January.     He himself would return on Sunday, the 15th January, but the foreign secretary, who would be attending the Council of theLeague of Nations, would probably not be able toreturn -until the 18th or 19th January.     He thought,however, that the Cabinet ought to meet and hear areport on the Rome visit at the earliest opportunity.He therefore proposed that, subject to any unforeseendevelopments, the next Meeting of the Cabinet shouldbe held at 11.0 a.m. on Wednesday, the 18th January.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION affairs and THE COLONIES said that he hoped to be able tosubmit proposals to the Cabinet in regard to our policy in Palestine with a view to their discussion at that Meeting.The Cabinet took note of theabove.
2.     The Cabinet again had before them thefollowing documents on the question of Assistance to china(a) A memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs (cp 266 (38)),(b) A memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer (CP. 868 (38)).A decision on the proposals contained in theSecretary of State&apos;s Memorandum had been postponedat the Meeting mentioned in the margin, pending a reply to inquiries made of the United StatesGovernment.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that three days ago a further telegram No0 869to Washington of the 17th December had been dispatched to our Charge d&apos;Affaires at Washingtongiving additional information as to the proposed guarantee of  3 millions for the support of theChinese currency,,     We were, however, still withoutany definite reply to the inquiries which we had madeof the United States Government.      Meanwhile, theReconstruction and Finance Corporation had publicly announced that the Export and Import Bank of america had authorised a 25 million dollar credit through aNew York Bank for financing exports to China.     TheChinese Ambassador in London had been delighted atthis news and had told the Foreign Secretary that if only Great Britain would now provide some financialassistance the position of China would be much morefavourable.     He (Lord Halifax) had replied that hewas not yet in a position to give a definite decision.The Chinese Ambassador had then begun to talk about the possibility of a bulk credit (say  millions) being made available to China out of the 10 millions which could be. guaranteed, without
reference to the Export Guarantees Advisory Council, underSection 4 of the Export Guarantees Bill.     He had made-it plain to the Chinese Ambassador that the  10 millionsrepresented the maximum amount of the liability which couldbe incurred in giving guarantees under th-   Section inquestion, and that there were many deserving claimants tohelp.The Foreign Secretary said that he thought theCabinet would only be willing to proceed in this matter with the full support of the United States Government.The proposed guaranteed loan for Chinese currency purposeswas, in his view, rather a different matter from the creditwhich the United States Government had authorised for financing exports to China.The Foreign Secretary, continuing, said that representatives of the Foreign Office, the Board of Tradeand the Treasury had met to consider a provisional andhypothetical allocation of the  10 millions of export credits guarantees to different countries, assuming thatthe Export Guarantees Bill passed into law.      Therepresentatives of these Departments had all agreed thatChina had a first claim and that the sum of  3 millions should be provisionally allocated to China, this sum toinclude the credit of  g- m:&apos;.million which it was proposed should be given in respect of the export of lorries.     Hethought that it would be helpful if the President of theBoard of Trade and the Chancellor of the Exchequer couldindicate their views on this matter.In conclusion,  the Foreign Secretary pointed outthat the Cabinet would not be meeting for some time, and he asked his colleagues to reach a conclusion to the effectthat, if the United States were prepared to take parallelaction in regard to the proposed guaranteed loan for curronoypurposes, he should be authorised to say that we would givea guarantee for currency purposes up to  3 millionso- 3 -
As regards the suggested allocation of  3 millions&apos;to China out of the proposed ilO millions e:rport creditswhich might he granted without reference to the export guarantees Advisory Council, THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARDOP TRADE pointed out that there could he no question of creating a &quot;block credit of 53 millions, on which Chinacould draw.     Applications must he submitted, and creditsapproved, in respect of particular consignments of goods.Some discussion ensued as to whether the amount which should be provisionally allocated to China inrespect of the export credits could be determined indepen-dently of the question whether a guaranteed loan was authorised for currency purposes,,THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD CP TRADE pointed outthat the provisional allocation of  3 millions to Chinaassumed that sums must be made available for certain othercountries to which,  in fact, no credits might in the endbe made.      If, therefore, the proposed guarantee in respectof the currency loan fell through, he thought that 3 millions should be regarded as on the low side.      Onthe other hand,  if the guaranteed loan for currencypurposes was approved,  then the total of the credits to begranted to China under the Export Credits Guarantee scheme should be reconsidered.     Although the two methods ofassistance proposed differed in form,  in substance bothwould have the result of facilitating imports, which would otherwise be impossible.In discussion, the desirability of doing what wecould to help China was emphasised.THE SECRETARY OP STA.TE FOR INDIA referred to an appreciation which he had recent^ received from the General
Staff in India as to the situation in Western China.According to this appreciation the Japanese were perhapsrather nearer the end of their tether than had been previously imagined, and they would get into serious difficulties if they had to send forces into Western China.The General Staff in India were anxious that steps shouldhe talcen to help Marshal Chiang Kai-Shek.THE CHANCELLOR 0? THE EXCHEQUER recalled that, atthe meeting of the Cabinet held on the 30th November(Cab. 57(38) Concl. 9), it had been decided that, inapproaching the United States Government, we should not give the impression that we had reached any decision inregard to the matter.     V/e were now proposing to gosomewhat further.It was also pointed out that the guaranteed loan for currency purposes would require special legislation,hut it was generally felt that such legislation would be welcomed by Parliament.After further discussion, the Cabinet agreed:-(l)    To authorise the Prime Minister, theChancellor of the Exchequer and theSecretary of State for Foreign affairs to reach a decision on the proposal to guarantee a contribution of  3. millions to the Chinese currency stabilisation fundon certain conditioxis, subject to theUnited States of ---merica agreeing to takeparallel action:(2)    That the same Ministers should he authorisedto decide whether a communication   should nowbe addressed to the United States Governmentinforming them that, if they were preparedto guarantee a loan for stabilisationpurposes, we should do likewise:(3)   That the part which might be allocated to china out of the aggregate amount( 10 millions) of liabilities which may be guaranteed under Section 4 of the export guarantees Bill, without reference to theExport Guarantees Advisory Council, shouldbe determined by the Treasury,  the ForeignOffice and the Board of Trade in consultation;and that the decision as to the amount soallocated would need.to be related to thedecision reached under (l) above.
Britishpropagandain.(previous reference:Cabinet 59(55) , Con-elusion 5.)3. The Cabinet again had under consideration aMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreignaffairs (CP. 284 (33)) on the subject of british propaganda in Germany, and heard a statement by theSecretary of State reporting the results of a further investigation, in accordance with the conclusion mentioned in the margin.Reciprocaltalks.THE SECRETiiRY CF ST,,TE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat agreement had been reached between the representa-tives of the Treasury and the Foreign Office on thepoints at issue.Perhaps the most important point had reference tothe arrangements proposed for reciprocal talks.    Inregard to Portugal, Scandinavia and certain othercountries, no difficulties were anticipated, and theForeign Office thought that the B.B.C  should be encouraged to go ahead with making reciprocal arrange-ments.    Germany, however, presented a more difficult problem.    It was suggested that Sir George Ogilvie-Forbesshould be instructed to raise the matter withField Marshal Goering, and that if the latter favoured the suggestion, the British Broadcasting corporation should then send a representative to Berlin to discussdetails with the German Broadcasting Authorities.    It was clear, however, that any arrangement reached would entailprior acceptance of the text of the talks by theGovernments of both countries, and that this might giverise to difficulties.
In the course of discussion the view was expressed that this proposal was fraught with danger and was unlikely to &quot;bring any practical advantages.    In theory nodoubt there was much to be said for the view that a goodimpression v/ould be made in Germany by talks deliveredonce a week by someone who could convey British ways of thinking, and that the impression made by such talks in Germany would be much greater than the impressionmade by German talks in this country.    On the other hand,instances were given of the embarrassment which mightensue from discussions on particular topics.    after discussion the Foreign Secretary agreed that hewoulddiscuss the question of reciprocal talks v/ith Germanyagain with Mr. Ogilvie of the B.E.C- , and that no action would betaken in regard to reciprocal talks with Germany without further reference to the Cabinet.Use of luxembourg - The Foreign Secretary reminded his colleaguesburg andLiechtenstein that there has been some discussion whether ourStations.participation in these talks could be effectively con-concealed.    He had looked into this matter farther and hewas satisfied that this could be done.    As an instance,he mentioned that the broadcasting from Luxemburg of thePrime Minister&apos;s speech to the Foreign Press association had ostensibly formed part of an advertising campaign.In further discussion general agreement was expressed with the view that broadcasting on short wavelengths was of the utmost importance, since in this wayalone large sections of the German people could be effectively reached.
THE LORD PRESIDENT OP THE COUNCIL said that he had information that the Liechtenstein Station was for sale.It was agreed that it would he unfortunate if thisStation was purchased by the German Government.THE HOME SECRETARY thought it important thatthe talks from these stations should start immediately and should be carried out on a methodical plan.w, sonalontacts.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat this matter v/as being followed up and he was nowsatisfied that it would be necessary to proceed throughindividual business men of distinction and repute, who should be very carefully selected for this purpose,rather than that any approach should be made through theFederation of British Industries.    General agreement was expressed with this view.The Cabinet agreed:-1.    To take note that the proposals in the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs&apos; Memorandum on british Propaganda in Germany (C,P.284(38)) hadbeen subject to detailed investigation by representatives of the Treasury and the ForeignOffice in their financial aspects, and that agreement had been reached.2. To approve generally the proposels set out inthe above Memorandum, subject to the followingpoints(a) that while the scheme for reciprocalbroadcasting generally should be proceeded with, no action should be taken in regard toreciprocal broadcasting v/ith Germany withoutfurther reference to the Cabinet.(b) that the proposed personal contacts should becarried out through Heads of particularbusinesses, carefully selected, and notthrough the Federation of British Industries.(c) that very considerable importance should beattached to broadcasting English programmes to Germany from the stations at Luxemburgand Liechtenstein.
isit-to-rome &apos;f the primeINIST3R andIecretary opTATE for0reign affairspreviouseferenceabinet 5738), Con-conclusion 7.)k. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSsain, that a Paper had been prepared commenting on all thepoints likely to be raised in Rome, but he thoughtit would suffice if he confined himself to the salient matters.     An important purpose of the visit was an attempt to improve our relationship v/ith signor mussolini, to clear up seme misunderstandings and perhaps to get on the right side of the Duce, in thehope that this might have some effect on his relationswith Herr Hitler,      He thought, however, that the centralfact of the visit was that a visit of the Prime Ministerto Italy would go far to influence Italian public opinion in the right direction.As regards the actual discussions,  our mainprinciple should be &quot;Nothing for nothing,&quot;       We shouldmake no concession to Signor Mussolini unless he would help us to obtain the detente which it was the objectOf our policy to attain.The main objects of discussion were likely to be(1) Spain,  (2) the relations between Italy and France,including the Italian claims on France, and (3) thef?/?.8^^r)2.gue2 Canal.      No doubt such matters as Italian Consularrepresentation in the Sudan would be mentioned,SPAIN. In regard to Spain, Signor Mussolini would n-(Previous doubt ask us to concede belligerent rights to general reference :[Cabinet 58 (38)$Franco.     We should tell him that it was impossibleponclusion 5.for us to do so politically, having regard to the statements which we had made on this matter.      It wouldalso be pointed out that this was contrary to thewhole policy which we had adopted in regard to theSpanish conflictoMore generally, we should point out that we werenot anxious to see an extreme Government of any description in Spain.     We might point out tn Signor
Mussolini that he had always said that his interestin the Spanish conflict was protection against thedanger of Communism,      This might lead to s orrE  exam-ination of the possibility of reaching a compromiseoIt might be suggested to Signor Mi.&apos;.ssolini that the longer he continued in his policy of giving help toGeneral Franco the harder it might be for him to extricate himself in the long run.      In this way he hoped to lead up to the suggestion for an armisticein Spain, but he was not sanguine enough to expect any immediate result.The Foreign Secretary thought, however, that weshould consider the p-ssibility that on the return from the Rome visit,  the Prime Minister should appealto both sides for an armistice and in-.. :te them tostate what they were fighting for.      In point of factthere was now much in common between the programmes of the two sides.      As the result of a number of contactswhich had been established,  it was generally agreed that once the fighting stopped it would never start again.There was also evidence of a good deal of discontentin Nationalist Spain,In the course of the discussion which ensued,emphasis was laid cn the need for maintaining theposition which we had hitherto adopted in regard to our refusal to grant belligerent rights, namely, thatwe could not grant such rights to parties in receiptof foreign assistanceQ      It was important that weshould not express partiality for either side.It was pointed out, however, that General Francowas asking for belligerent rights far wider in scopethat those which would be conceded under the British plan,since he wished to stop food from reaching GovernmentSpain.      If he once started on this course, with theassistance, perhaps, of warsnips lent by the Italian-10-
Government,,  all sorts of difficulties would ensue.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed with the foreign secretary&apos;s view that the main object of the visit was to reach a better understanding with signor mussolini, but he was also undertaking the visitwith the definite purpose of securing Signor Mussolini&apos;sgood offices in Berliru     For some time past it hadbeen impossible for this country to ta^e any usefulaction in Berlin and he therefore preferred to leaveBerlin alone.     He hoped, however, that signor mussolini could be persuaded to prevent Herr Hitlerfrom carrying out some &quot;mad dog&quot; actoContinuing, the Prime Minister said that he did not object to the Foreign Secretary&apos;s phrase&quot;Nothing for nothing&quot;.      But? its complement was &quot;Somethmfor something&quot;, and he thought we must consider whatconcession we should ask from Signor Mussolini inreturn for any request that he might make of us..He (the Prime Minister) was clear what the answer tothis question should be, namely, that we should obtain Signor Mussolini&apos;s help in bringing the war in spain to an end.      A peaceful Mediterranean wasvital to us,, and at the moment   Spain was the most dangerous point in the Mediterranean,.      If signor mussolini could be persuaded to use his influencehe could do more than anyone else to bring the war to an end*.How could this be done?     Signor Mussolini had made up his mind that he wanted General Franco towin the war, and he would say that as GeneralFrance was bound to win in the end, it would be much better that we should concede belligerent rights to him and thereby enable him to finish off the warquickly.    To this our answer must be that politically,-11-
it was impossible for us to take this course,    . Indeed,only two days ago he had re-strted in the House ofCemmons our attitude in regard to the grant of belligerent rights.The Prime Minister agreed that the right way toobtain a settlement was through an armistice.    Hethought it was possible that an appeal to bothsides by suitable persons might succeed.     At Munichhe had asked Herr Hitler why the four Powers shouldnot address an appeal to Spain for an armistice, and sign or Mussolini had undertaken t- think the matter over.      The idea, therefore; had not been rejectedoutright by Signor Mussolini,  and it was certainlyworth while putting it to him again.The Prime Minister also thought that an appeal by the four Munich i0wers might be attractive toSignnr Mussolini, who had always favoured Pour-PowerPacts.      He would propose to start by suggesting anappeal by the four Powers, but he himself would be content with an appeal by three Powers, i.e.,Great Britain, Prance and Italy,;    or indeed two Powers,Great Britain and Italy.      There was a further point,that the restoration of good relations bet-ween france and  Italy would be much facilitated .by the ending ofthe Spanish War.The Prime Minister said that he was prepared togive something in exchange lor Signor Mussolini&apos;sgood offices in this connection.      What thatconcession would be he could not say, but it would not,of course, be the grant of belligerent rights.One possibility might be that if Signor Mussoliniwas anxious to discuss v/ith Prance, say, the question,of the Italians in Tunis, we should say that we wouldnot discourage the French from discussing this
matter.     In the same way, he thought it would he not unreasonable that we should undertake to discuss theposition in regard to the Suez Canal.    It must, however,he made quite clear that in our view it v/as useless for italy to think of asking France to make any territorialconcessions.     In our view, however, it would not heunreasonable to accede to a proposal to discuss, say,the Jibuti Railway or the Suez Canal.Discussion ensued as to what concession we could properly make to Signor Mussolini, if he agreed to make an appeal for an armistice.      It was pointed out that,although Signor Mussolini could not guarantee that the appeal would be successful? the mere making of the appeal would be a gesture of goodwill which would have value.On the other hand we must be careful that we did not allow ourselves to be drawn into discussion of concretematters such as the position in regard to the suez canal- - discussion of which could hardly be terminatedwithout making some concession to Italy - if there wasa danger that we might obtain no concrete benefitsourselves as a result of the Rome discussions.      It wassuggested in this comaection that it would be necessaryto bear in mind the position of the Italian forces in spain, and that if Mussolini was genuinely anxious foran armistice, it would be inconsistent for him tocontinue to keep forces in Spain or at any rate to keepforces at the present level.It was also pointed out that there were certainobvious dangers to be avoided if the discussions turnedon matters affecting French interests, e.g. Tunis orJibuti, unless we maintained the closest touch withthe French Government.
THE PRIME MINISTER said that he did not proposeto go beyond the line that v/e would not encourage theFrench to refuse to discuss such matters.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he proposed todraw a sharp line of distinction betv/een (i) territorialclaims, on which we v/ould say that so far as we werein a position to judge, it was clear that no concession could be made, and (ii) other matters.     As regardsthe latter we had, of course, no knowledge of the merits of the questions at issue, but v/e v/ere anxious that france and Italy should be on good terms with one another.A reference was made by THE PRESIDENT OF THEBOARD OF EDUCATION to telegram No, 404 from   France,reporting a statement that the Fascist Grand council had decided that Italian interests demanded that italy should remain in permanent possession at Majorca.THE PRIME MINISTER said that it wasSignor Mussolini, and not the Fascist Grand council who settled matters in Italy,      He did not believethat Signor Mussolini intended to make any suchclaim, which he did not think would be in his owninterestsoTHE SECRETLY OF STATE FOR V/AR pointed out that vstrategically Sicily, Pantellaria and Tunis, if allin Italian hands, would virtually close the central mediterranean, and he thought that this might well be. Signor Mussolini&apos;s ultimate strategic aim.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had no doubtthat Signor Mussolini would like to have Tunis, but he
doubted whether he would he prepared to pay an enormousprice for ito       If we made cur attitude clear from the outset, he did not think that Tunis would give riseto any difficulties, at any rate at  the  present time.The o ther matters mentioned by the foreign secretary as likely to be discussed in Rome were not discussed by the Cabinet, since it was agreed that thesame general principles would apply in regard to thesematters, as applied to the Spanish conflictThe Cabinet took note of the statements made bythe Prime Minister and the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs in regard to the Anglo-Italian conversations in Rome, and approved generally/- the line of action proposedo

THE SECRETARY OP STATS POR FOREIGN affairs said that the previous day he had seen the german ambassador, who had informed him that the GermanGovernment agreed to the proposal which, v/e had made that consultation should take place between representatives of the British and German governments in regard to Gormany^ proposals to constructsubmarines up to 100 per cent, of our strength -and--to convert two 6-inch gun cruisers into 8-inch cruisers.The German Government proposed that these discussions should take place in Berlin &quot;between Christmas and theNew Year,The Cabinet took note of the statement bythe Secreta^y-or&quot;&quot;S-state for&quot;&quot;Poreign.

VISIT OF 6. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTERDR.  SCHACHT.____ said that for some time past the Inter-GovernmentalThe Jewish        Committee for Refugees had been trying to getProblem. into touch with the German Government.    Last week,(&quot;P i? e v i o \i si i     Z. Z accompanied       Mr. Rublee, the Director-Generaljl\Cl ereii.ceCabConclusi?!^^? v01&quot; Inter-Governmental Committee for Refugees,elusion o. ) orand Sir F. Leith-Ross he had received Dr. Schacht.The latter had outlined a scheme for financingemigration from Germany by an internationalrefugee loan, the service of which would be met from the proceeds of German exports to be paid for from a trust fund in Reichsmarks establishedfrom the refugees&apos; resources in Germany.    Dr.Schacht said that if this scheme could beaccepted as a basis of discussion, there would beno difficulty in arranging for iir. Rublee to visit Berlin.    Copies of a record of the interviewhad been sent to the Ministers most,directly concerned.In the course of discussion he had emphasised that Mr. Rublee was the executive officer, of the Governmental Committee and that he(the Chancellor of the Duchy) had personally no executive power.    He had also asked Dr. Schacht toexplain to General Goering that the Evian Committeewas approaching the Jewish problem objectively asa matter to be solved without heat, and that heand Mr. Rublee had both refrained from public criticism of the policy of the German Government.The scheme put forward by Dr. Schachtwas very complicated and presented many difficulties.    Dr.  Schacht had agreed that the
contact which had now been established betweenthe German Government and the Inter-governmental committee could be resumed at any moment.    Hehad spoken with great freedom, and had made itclear that he had no sympathy with the policyof the German Government in this matter.It had been decided to set up asmall Committee under the Presidency ofMr. Rublee to examine the scheme from the pointof view of the Governments concerned, and Dr.Schacht would be informed of the results of this enquiry. He understood that Sir P. Leith-Rossand Sir Horace V/ilson thought there was some prospect that agreement might be reached on thematter.    He hoped to circulate a Memorandum to theCabinet in January to show what had been achieved in regard to the refugee question generally.    Thenumber of Jews who had left Germany was in facta good deal larger than was commonly supposed.Continuing, the Chancellor said that hehad been in touch with a number of leading jews in this country who had taken the view that they thought it would be wrong that they should receiveconcessions at the cost of the British taxpayer.In conclusion, the Chancellor expressed his gratitude to the Secretary of State for HomeAffairs and to the Secretary of State forDominions and Colonies for their assistance inregard to the refugee problem.Some discussion ensued as to the capacity in which Dr. Schacht had visited this country.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER hoped that no
announcement would &quot;be issued which, would be a&apos;contradiction of the statement which he had madein Parliament the previous day,  that Dr.  Schachthad not come over here as a representative of theGerman Government.    It was agreed that it wouldbe desirable that any public statement should conform   to      this statement, and, further,that it was undesirable that Ministers should referpublicly to Dr. Schacht in their speeches,  since this might weaken his position in Germany.    Atthe same time Dr.  Schacht was still a Minister ofthe Reich, and he had come to this country afterseeing Herr Hitler and with Herr Hitler&apos;spermission.On the merits of the scheme proposedby Dr.  Sehacht, the PRIMS MINISTER and thePRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE expressed theview that the scheme was not one which could possibly be accepted.    The latter added that thescheme was tantamount to assisting the refugeesat the expense of British traders.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGNABFAIRS said that he thought we should also actvery cautiously in regard to any scheme whichwould afford assistance at this moment to the nazi Regime, which he thought was encounteringserious economic difficulties.THE SECRETARY OF STATS FOR HOME AFFAIRS,while agreeing that the German proposals were difficult to justify, said that he was satisfiedthat the problem of the Jewish Refugees would beinsoluble unless the German Government could be
persuaded to allow the Jews to take some part oftheir capital out of that country.    He attached theutmost importance to maintaining the contacts withBerlin that had been established.THE PRIME MINISTER said that hiscolleagues had no doubt noticed that, according tothe statement in the Press, Dr. Schachthad been disappointed      that he had not been ableto see the Prime Minister.    He had in fact seenhim for over an hour, and had discussed theconditions in Germany at length.    Dr. Schacht had made it clear that he was quite out of sympathy with the present regime in Germany, and that hewas extremely anxious to maintain the contacts v/hichhad been established.    It had been sugg-sted, forexample, that Sir P. Leith-RoSs might go toGermany and that Dr.  Punk might pay a returnvisit to this country:.    There had also been asuggestion that the President of the Board ofTrade should pay a visit to Germany.    He thoughtthat these contacts should be continued.Co-operation Dr. Schacht had also referred toin &quot;China.possible co-operation in China between British andGerman interests, and had expressed the view thatsome means of co-operation in China could beachieved.The Cabinet took note of the above statements.
LO-GSRIiAIT 7o      TIE! F.13SIDE2TT CP T.tE BOARD OF TRADE said thatDS TI01TS. he had had discussions with Dr. Schacht in regardjTj^ to allocation of neutral markets between Germany and&quot; 3(3^)4--     this country, and he thought that it was by no meansimpossible that some agreement might be reached inthis matter.      It would, however, be obvious that theproposals put forward by Germany for dealing with theJewish Refugee problem were inconsistent with thesewider proposals in regard, to Anglo-German trade relations.Dr. Schacht had been anxious that we should establishcontact with Dr. Funk, who would, he thought, be happy to visit this country.      The President also mentioned thatthere v/as a possibility that a satisfactory agreement on coal would be concluded with Germany^     This would takethe form of an agreement between employers&apos; organisations^but ill point of fact it would be brought about by the intervention of the Governments concerned after thenegotiations- between the Employers&apos;- Organisation had broken down.The President of the Board of Trade said that hewould like the guidance of his colleagues as to whether,if a suitable opportunity arose, he should pay such a visit to Germany.,     Further, in his opinion the contactswhich v/ould normally take place between business interests concerned should be encouraged.TIIH PRILE L1IITISTER expressed the view thatit would be desirable that the President of the Boardof Trade should take action on the lines suggested asopportunit3r offered,.The Cabinet agreed with this view.-SI-
80     TEE CHANCELLOR OP TIE EXCHEQUEIi reminded hiscolleagues of the position reached at the Meeting, re-corded in the margin, on the question of the grant offinancial assistance to Czechoslovakia-      It had provedextremely difficult to carry the negotiations on thismatter to a conclusion.     The v/hole advance of  10 millionshad been made to the Czechoslovak Government, and v/ehad no lever which v/e could adopt to persuade them toreach a decision on the matter.     The Chancellor askedhis colleagues to give him discretion, if it should be necessary    in order to bring the negotiations to asatisfactory issue but not otherwise, to increase thetotal sum to be made available to Czechoslovakia by wayof gift as well as by loan, from  10 millions to  12millions.     He thought that it might also be necessarythat the amount of the gift should be increased from 4 millions to  5 millions-      Unless he had some concession in hand, to be used in case of necessity,he was afraid that when the House of Commons reassembledat the end of January, the negotiations v/ith Czecho-slovakia might still not be concluded, in which case there would be no basis on which to found legislation.THE PRIME MINISTER said that in his vie.: it was very desirable that we should obtain definite.control over theuse to be made of the financial assistance accorded to czechoslovakia.     He v/as afraid that that would not prove possible unless the Chancellor had some furtherinducement which he could offer in the course of thenegotiations.The Cabinet agreed -To authorise the Chancellor of the exchequer to make concessions within the limits pro-posed, if this should prove necessarj&apos;&apos; in thecourse of negotiations

9. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS AND THE COLONIES said that arrangements in regard to the London Conference were proceeding satisfactorily, if somewhat slowly. During the previous week, the Jewish Agency had been strongly inclined to withdraw their acceptance, but Dr. Weizmann with the support of Mr. Shertok had now definitely recommended to the Executive Committee that representatives of the Agency should attend the Conference. The Executive Committee was seriously split on this issue, but he thought that a majority would be in favour of attending the Conference.

On the Arab side, King Ibn Saud was continuing to urge on the Mufti the inclusion of certain Moderates among the representatives of the Palestinian Arabs. The mufti was resisting this pressure.

In Palestine itself, as the result of the restoration of order, the Moderates were growing stronger.

The Daily Telegraph had published that morning a list of delegates chosen by the Mufti. If this list was correct, it was by no means unsatisfactory, and was far better than the list which the Mufti had sent in a week or so ago.

On the matter of the representation of the Palestinian Arabs, we were therefore still awaiting developments. It was, however, impossible to leave matters as they were indefinitely, and a telegram had been sent to Sir R. Bullard at Jeddah on the 20th December, instructing him to point out to Ibn Saud that it was necessary that the London discussions should start not later than the 18th January and asking hims to ensure that the representatives were selected in time to be in London by that date.


The Mufti had proposed that a conference shouldhe held of all the Arab delegates at some place in theNear East before the delegates had left for London.Ibn Saud had resisted this proposal, and was beinggenerally helpful.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs and the Colonies said that he had sent to the HighCommissioner in Palestine certain tentative proposals in regard to our policy in Palestine includingimmigration, and he wished to obtain the high commissioners views before submitting these proposals to the Cabinet Committee.     He hoped to be able to submit proposals to the Cabinet at the meeting to be held onthe 18th January.Discussion then took place in regard to theprivate letter from H.M. Ambassador in Cairo (CP ,293 (38)).THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR said that it wasthe view of the Air Staff, if another crisis should findus with a hostile Arab world behind us in the middle east, that our military position there v/ould be quiteuntenable and that with the loss of our military positionwould go the loss of our vital land, air and sea communications to the Par East,THE MINISTER PCR CO-ORDINATION OP defence pointed out that the Chiefs of Staff, in their previousappreciations, had only touched in a general way on thequestion of hostility of individual Arab States.     Theyhad assumed that, in the event of war with Italy, bothIraq and Egypt would be on our side and that Ibn Saudwould, at any rate, not be against us.     If, however,the Arab world was to be united against us, the wholeof the existing Staff Appreciations and also these nowunder preparation weald have to be recasts  -
THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that he thought it right to let his colleagues seeSir Miles Lampson&apos;s letter.     He thought it might wellhe that the views expressed in that letter were somewhattinged v/ith pessimism.     At the same time, he thoughtthat there v/as no disagreement on the extreme desirabilityof our not arousing antagonism with the Arabs, and thatthe forthcoming negotiations at the London Conferencemust be so   conducted    as to ensure that the arab states would be friendly towards us.      But until theConference met, we could not say how far we should haveto go in order to meet.jtheir viev/s.The Cabinet took note-of&quot;these statements.
10.       The Cabinet had before them a Host Secret Reportby the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence (CP. 289(38)) entitled &quot;The Increase of Manufacturing capacity for certain Armaments to Build up to a Greater war potential and to Meet Foreign Orders&quot;,to whichrhe attached,a Memorandum by the Chiefs of Staff Committee on theRelative Strategic Importance of Countries requiring arms from the United Kingdom (CI.D. Paper No.  1488-3),together with the relevant extract from the 340th Meetingof the Committee of Imperial Defence (Minute 5).      Inhis Memorandum the Minister dealt with the subject underthe following main headings, viz:-(a) Aircraft.(b) Guns and Ancillary Equipment.(c) Armour*added observations on the general capacity of the countryfor gun equipments, and outlined the steps considered necessary to be taken.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE outlined the main points in his Report.     With regard to aircraft,although there was still a substantial problem to bedealt with in creating an adequate war potential, he did not recommend the. development of further capacity solely forthe purpose of meeting foreign orders for aircraft.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR agreed with thisview.In regard to the Navy, THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATIONOF DEFENCE pointed out that the existing gun capacity was,broadly speaking,  sufficient on the present navalhypothesis.      The First Sea Lord was, however, anxious that v/e should be in a position to lay down capital ships
after war had broken out, and aJLscr-Y/jLshed to-teve a margin of capacity to meet any possible increa-ses inthe German arid-Japanese shipbuilding programmes.      Ifincreases in capacity for heavy guns and gun-mountingswere authorised, it would also be necessary to authoriseincreases in armour plant.As regards the Array, the Minister for Co-ordinationtjference: of Defence reminded the Cabinet that it had been agreedjbinet 53(38).)that the number of A.A, equipments at present authorisedshould be increased to the number specified in the &quot;ideal&quot;scheme (1,264), together with the additional numbers required for ports abroad-     Consequential on thisdecision the War Office had been authorised to place anorder for 300 additional guns and to create the capacityrequired to carry out the increased programme.     Theproposed factory in the Glasgow area was at Dalmuir andwould have a capacity of 300 guns a year.      The cost ofthe factory required for this purpose, which he recommendedshould be authorised forthwith, was  1,200,000.There was also the question whether capacityshould now be increased to meet the requirements infield and medium calibre artiller2r of a second contingent to the Field Force.      The additional cost of thisproposal was  170,000.     He proposed in paragraph 29 ofhis Report that this matter should be considered inconjunction with the Secretary of State for War&apos;sproposals on the State of Preparedness of the Army inrelation to its Role (C.I.D1 Paper No. 1498).The Chief of the Imperial General Staff had suggested that the absolute priority now given toA.A. equipment should be modified, so as to make better provision for the medium artillery of the Field Force.
44?He thought it right-^c-^Kv^J^tl^c-^^e^tion of his -colleagues to this view, hut he v/as not himseir inagreement with it.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the most urgentmatter dealt with in the Minister&apos;s Report was theproposed new factory at Dalmuir, at a cost of 51,200,000.He v/as fully in agreement with the view that this factoryshould be proceeded with at once, but he rather doubted whether in present circumstances we should not adopt a somewhat bolder course and provide a factory with alarger output than 300 guns a year.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR welcomed thissuggestion and ashed whether it v/ould not be possible to lay down a factory which would provide the whole of theadditional 600 A,A. guns required for the air defence ofGreat Britain within a single year.THE FIRST LORD CP THE ADMIRALTY said that he had no intention of trying to obtain authority for a largerFleet by a side wind, but he invited attention to theposition as set out in paragraph 11 of the Report inregard to the proportion of heavy gun capacity located in the vulnerable area of Woolwich.     Further, if germany or Japan were to start larger building programmes, itwould be impossible for us to make any increase in ourpresent scale of programmes until a period of 18 monthshad elapsed in which new factories were built.Turning to ports at home and abroad, the FirstLord gave information as to the extent to which 6&quot; and.2&quot; guns   in coast defences required modernisation with high angle mountings.      On the present basis there seemedlittle or no prospect that any appreciable number of thesegun-mountings would be modernised until 1944 at the earliest.
He could not entirely subscribe to the Minister&apos;sstatement that provision of additional capacity for heavy guns and gun-mountings would entail the provisionof additional plant for armour.      In the last v/ar only two major naval battles had been fought.      If in any future war a much larger number of battles were fought,we should require additional provision for re-lining guns.There was also the possibility that v/e might require tobuild monitors, which would have big guns butHe also referred to the fact that in the last v/ar anumber of big ships had been completed within two or threeyears of laying down, e. go, the &quot;CourageousSl, the &quot;Renown&quot;and the &quot;Repulse&quot;.      Generally, his view was that were quired additional production.THE MI LUSTER 0? LABOUR said that he thought itwas important to malce sure whether there was any other suitable capacity for this work already existing in thecountry, and whether the position might not be relieved by the transfer to work on large mountings of labour at present engaged on small mountings,   vTHE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that he agreedto the proposal in paragraph 28 that a new factory shouldbe set up at Dalmuir, at a cost of  1,200,000, &apos; primarily for A.A. guns;   but he thought the proposal in paragraph 29to set up capacity to provide concurrently field and medium-calibre artillery for the second contingent of theField Force should be considered in conjunction with theSecretary of State for War&apos;s proposals in regard to thestate of preparedness of the Army.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he agreed that theproposal in paragraph 29 of the Memorandum should be deferred, but he thought it would be desirable that the
Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, together with theSecretary of State for War, should look again into thequestion of a further extension of the capacity to makeA.A. guns.In discussion, general agreement was expressed with this view.     It was pointed out that the so-called&quot;Ideal&quot; scheme for the air defence of Great Britain hadbeen drawn up two years ago and had been regarded by theChiefs of Staff at that date as by no means an over-insurance.     Further, there was a tendency for therequirements of air defence to ixocrease.In the course of further discussion THE SECRETARYOF STATE FOR WAR explained that it was the intention thatthe existing capacity at Nottingham and Woolwich now engaged on production of A.A. guns should turn over to theproduction of field and medium artillery for the field force on completion of the programme as it stood beforethe decision reached by the Cabinet on the 7th November toauthorise further guns for the air defence of Great Britain,The general view of the Cabinet v/as, on the one hand, thatthis decision might require to be reconsidered at some future date, but, on the other hand, that no action shouldbe taken at the present time to cancel the priorityaccorded to the manufacture of A.A. guns.The Cabinet agreed:- .(l)   That no steps should be taken todevelop additional capacity solely forforeign requirements of aircraft, butthat the problem of creating adequatewar potential for the Air Force requiresseparate consideration:(2)   To approve the proposal that a new factoryshould be set up in the Glasgow area forthe primary purpose of the manufacture ofadditional A.A. guns, at an estimated costof  1,200,000, the financial details being settled between the War Office and theTreasury in the usual way:
(3)    That the Minister fof-jGo-^ordination ofDefence,  in -conjunction with the e*eretaryof State for War, should give considerationto the provision of additional capacity forthe manufacture of A.A. guns;    such capacitybeing, if possible, laid out so as to be suitable for the manufacture of other types of medium-calibre guns below 6&quot;:(4)   That the proposal to expand the new factorynear Glasgow so as to secure sufficientcapacity to provide concurrently field and medium-calibre artillery for the secondcontingent of the Field Force, should beconsidered in conjunction with the Secretaryof State for War&apos;s proposals in his Memorandumon the State of Preparedness of the Army inRelation to its Role (C.I.D. Paper No.1498-B):(5)   That the proposals to create additional capacity for heavy Naval guns and gun-mountings and armour for the Navy should&quot;be further examined by the Minister forGo-ordination of Defence and the FirstLord of the -admiralty:(6)    That the absolute priority at presentaccorded to gun manufacture for A.D.G. B.requirements should continue for the time&quot;being.
EMERGENCY RE- 11.   The Cabinet had   hefo-^e-them a Note by theCONSTRUCT TON.Minister for Co-ordination of Defence (-CP.-295 (38))(Previous circulating direct to the Cabinet the Report of a reference:Cabinet 49 Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial &quot;Defence(38). Con-elusion 13,) on Emergency Reconstruction CCoI.Dc Paper No,1499-E),PR 2-^(39)7*? se^ u^ ^ ^Cie -pr-*-rne Minister in pursuance of theConclusion mentioned in the margin0    The recommenda-tions of the Sub-Committee may be summarised, asfollows:-(a.) That, in regard to housing accommodationthe Ministry o^ Health and Department ofHealth for Scotland should prepare the requisite organisation and legislation: r.rpor:...n3 on looal authorities dalles inoonj:.ec --lor. v/i tli emergency repairs to working-class houses,  c-cbjecv. to Government control onthe lines xndrtoated in paragraphs 7-10 of theiCCJpo . j .(b) That all Civil Departments who may be concerned with emergency repairs and.reconstruction should  (i) make the best estimate possible ofthe material and. labour they arelikely to require to meet the firsttwelve months of Var and submit itto the Board o^ Trade:(ii) prepare any legislation which may beneeessa.ry to give them the power tomake the cost of repairs a first charge on the property repaired;    and(iii) inform the Ministry of Labour ifthere are certain key men connectedv/ith public utilities who must bekept, in their civil occupations;( c) That a. liaison Committee should be set upon which the Civil Departments should berepresented;(d) That legislation should be prepared, toauthorise the setting up of the specialbody proposed, by the Committee in para-graph 15 ^or the purpose o^ repair of factories, shops, offices, etc.&apos;(e) That a Committee should be constituted toconsider a number of ancillary questions referred to in paragraphs 36-29 of theReport, and. to advise on the necessary legislation., viz.,:-
(i)   Various questions arising out or theUthwatt Committee Report as to thelegal obligations of lessees to repair property:(ii)   Cognate questions as to the liability to make good war damage to property and goods in various circumstances.THE MINISTER OF HEALTH invited attention to the summary of Recommendations at the conclusion of theReport,     He pointed out that, although the Ministry ofLahour had not been represented on the Committee, it was clear that labour requirements would bulk largely in theconsideration of emergency repairs and reconstruction.He proposed that particulars as to labour requirements should be referred to the Mf^mim^mE^.The Minister of Health also drew attention tothe enormous size of the estimated demands for emergencyrepairs and reconstruction in time of war, which represented approximately four times the amount-of buildingas compared with our maximum effort, in.-times of peace.THE MINISTER OF LABOUR said that he attached importance to his Department being represented on theproposed.liaison Committee.     He also drew attention tothe fact that there was already-a Consultative Committeein the building industry, as well as a Committee ofrepresentatives of Government Departments concerned withbuilding programmes, presided over by the permanent secretary of the Ministry of Labour.     The matters dealtwith in Appendix II of the Report, in regard to materials and labour, should not be dealt with without consultationwith these two Committees.THE MINISTER OF HEALTH concurred in these suggestions.The Cabinet agreed:(l)   To approve the recommendations contained in the Report of the Sub-Committee of the Committee of ImperialDefence on Sue rgency Reconstruction,summarised above:
That the Minister of Health should consult with the prime Minister inregard to the setting up of -(a) the proposed liaison Committeeto deal with emergency repairs and reconstruction, which should include a representative of theMinistry of Labour:(b) the Committee to consider the ancillary questions referred to inparagraphs 26-29 of the Report.
AUSTRALIA. 12.     The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Air (CP.-294 (38))Manufactureof Aircraft        stating that, on the initiative of the Australian Highin.Commissioner (with the support of the Australian PrimeMinister), the possibility had been considered of setting up in Australia a scheme, somewhat on the linesof the   Canadian scheme already approved, for thecreation of war potential for the production of aircraft in Australia, for the joint use of the UnitedKingdom and Australian air forces.     The Secretary ofState submitted, for the approval of the Cabinet, thata Mission should be despatched to Australia to examine this possibility, in consultation with representativesof the Australian Government and to prepare a schemefor the consideration of the two Governments.      If, afterconsultation with the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs, it should appear desirable for the Mission to visit New Zealand also -or a similar purpose, arrangements would be made accordingly.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that thisproposal differed in certain respects from the Canadianscheme,  inasmuch as it was proposed that we should place orders jointly with the Australian Government.     TheBeaufort machines which it v/as proposed to order wouldreckon as part of the general programme which he had placed before the Cabinet.     The machines v/ould, of course,cost more to manufacture in Australia than in this country,but he thought that the additional cost would be justified by the advantage of having war potential in Australia,away from possible trouble and in a place where the capacity could be used to reinforce Singapore and^ perhaps Commands further West.     lie sought the authority
of the Cabinet to send a Mission to Australia to discussthe matter with the Australian authorities.     It was desirable that the Mission should proceed in the near future,as the scheme had largely been inspired by Mr. Bruce, whowas now on a visit to Australia.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that he thoughtthat, as matters had developed, it was necessary that theMission should proceed to Australia as proposed.     he wished to emphasise that the scheme was on a different footing from the Canadian scheme.     Whereas Canada v/as notliable to attack, Australia v/as in need of capacity for her own use, and this should be reflected in the financial terms.The Chancellor also stressed the desirability of theMission being given fairly strict financial terms ofreference.THE SECRETARY 0? STATE FOR AIR said that he v/as inagreement with this view.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE pointed out thatat the present time Australian aircraft were fitted withengines from the United States.      This enabled the Americanmanufacturers to get a hold on the motor market.     He hopedthat these machines would be fitted v/ith British engines.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that this was the case.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS alsosupported the proposal.The Cabinet agreed -(i) To authorise the despatch of a Mission toAustralia to examine, in consultation v/ithrepresentatives of the Australian Government,the possibility of the creation of capacity for the production of aircraft in the Commonwealth,and to prepare a scheme for the consideration ofthe two Governments.     If, after consultationwith the Secretary of State for the Dominions, itshould appear   desirable for the Mission to visitNew Zealand also for a similar purpose, arrange-ments should be made accordingly.(ii) That the terms of reference of the Mission in financial matters should be settled by theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary ofState for Air in consultation.-36-
13.       The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe. Minister of Transport ( CP.-278 (38)) in amplification-cation of his statement, made at the previous Meeting,on the financial position of the Main Line RailwayCompanies and their proposals for the repeal of theexi^tin? statutory provisions relating to the  charges for the conveyance of merchandise traffic by rail(Attached to the Memorandum as Annexes A and B).The Railways contended that they should be givencomplete freedom, to make their own bargains withtraders, as was the case with road hauliers.   Thisproposal was a complete reversal of the general policy towards transport adopted by successive Governmentssince the War, which had. been one of co-ordination and not  competition between the different forms oftransport.    The Minister&apos;s examination of the position had led him to the tentative conclusion that on meritsthere was a case for some material relaxation of theexisting statutory regulations, but falling short ofthe wholesale proposals of the Companies.   He had therefore referred the proposals to the transport advisory Council, and a-fter receiving their Reporthe hoped to be in a position to place before hiscolleagues  concrete suggestions for dealing with thedifficulties of the Railway Companies in a manner which would still safeguard the other interests con-cerned..
On the suggestion of the Prime Minister itwas agreed that any Minister who had any views orsuggestions&apos;in regard to this matter should communicate them to the Minister of Transport.     It was suggestedthat the matter was one which affected in particular the Board of Trade and the Ministry of Agricultureand Fisheries.     In the course of discussion it wasalso agreed that consideration should he given at alater date to the appointment of a Cabinet Sub-Comaitteeto consider the Report from the Transport AdvisoryCouncil when received.The Cabinet agreed -(i)   To take note of the Memorandum by theMinister of Transport (CP.278(38)) .(ii)   To invite Ministers to submit anyconcrete suggestions for dealing withthe difficulties of the railways to theMinister of Transport.
THE C9TT0NINDUSTRY.proposed bill.(previous reference:Cabinet 58(38), Con-clusion 8,)14.     The Cabinet bad under oc-intensification devotion, a M-emo-rand-ora by the President of the Board of Trade (C.P.-292 (38)) reporting upon the further negotiations ofthe Joint Committee of Cotton Trade Organisations,which had led to the introduction of a number ofmodifications into the scheme for the reorganisation of the industry.   The effect of the modifications hadbeen as follows:    first, to simplify the proposals,which now contemplated only two kinds of sectionalschemes dealing respectively with redundancy and minimum prices&apos;    secondly, to introduce certain safe-guards, of which the most important was the additionof an independent element to the Cotton industry board:    and, thirdly, to eliminate two of the mostcontroversial features,, namely, &quot;pool and quota&quot;schemes an* legalisation of wage agreements.    Inthe light of the negotiations, which were still continuing, it would probably be necessary to effect-further amendments in the draft Bill which had beenprepared.    The President aske^ for authority to publish a White Paper -containing a memory, rvd uiq^. explain-ing briefly &quot;what the proposals were, and the clauses of a draft Bill, which would in effect be a transla-tion into legal form of the Joint Committee&apos;? proposals,subject to amendments indicated in his Memorandum.Tf evidence was obtained o^ a sufficient measure of support ^or the proposals, he hoped that the bill would be ready for introduction in February, aftersubmission in final form to the Committee of HomeAffairs.
In a short discussion the PRESIDENT OP THEBOARD OP TRADE said that while no agreement had yet&quot;been reached,  the points of difference had beennarrowed, and he thought that opposition to the bill would not be formidable.THE MINISTER OP LABOUR said that the removalof the provision for the legalisation of wageagreements from the Bill had been well received in all quarters.The Cabinet agreed to authorise thePresident of the Board of Trade to publish a White Paper containing amemorandum setting out the proposals to be contained in the clauses of adraft Bill on the lines indicated in his memorandum, subject to (a) settlementof the financial clauses with theTreasury, and (b) submission of thedraft Bill in due course to the HomeAffairs Committee.
THE SPECIALAREAS .(previous reference:Cabinet 58(38), Con-elusion 8.)15.      The Cabinet had before them Memoranda by theMinister of.Labour ( CP.-291 (38)) and the Secretaryof State for Scotland (CP.-290 (38))  circulating,for the     information of their colleagues, proofcopies of *he Reports of the Commissioners for theSpecial Areas in England and Wales, and Scotland,respectively, for the year ended 30th September, 1938The Ministers proposed that the Reports should bepublished forthwith.The Cabinet took note of the abovedocuments and agreed that the Reportsof the Commissioners for the SpecialAreas in England and wales, and scotland    respectively, should, bepublished forthwith.
NATIONALFITNESSGRANTS .(previous reference:Cabinet 59(38), Con-clue ion 8.)16.       The C8binet again hart under consideration aMemorandum by the Pres-ident of the Board of Education(CP.-283 (38)) on the subject of National FitnessGrants, on which a decision had been postponed pending a report by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on theresults of a Conference o^ Ministers arranged at theMeeting mentioned in the margin.THE CHANCELLOR 0.&quot; THE EXCHEQUER said that ameeting had been held the previous day$, attended byrthe President of the Board of Education^ the Minister ofHealthy the Secretary of State for Scotland and himself.After an exchange of viewss agreement had been reached onthe following basis.    First the view had been accepted that capital grants  as envisaged in the White paper and the Financial Memorandum were intended to establish the National Fitness Movement during an initial period,after which the only cost to be incurred would beannual maintenance costs.    Secondly he had agreed thatthe figure of  2*400,000 which had been included in theFinancial Memorandum as the provisional estimate ofthe capital cost of the scheme should be increased to 4 millions.    This offer had been accepted.    This sumof  4 millions now represented the limit of the Treasuryobligations in respect of capital grants under the 1957Act.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF EDUCATION thankedthe Chancellor of the Exchequer for the increase in thesum available for capital grants to  4 millions.    HethoughtB howevers that he should make it clear that his acceptance of this offer did not, of course, precludehim from referring to the general question of NationalFitness, and proposals to deal with it, on a futureoccasion, should the need fqr doing so arise.The Cabinet took note of the above decisions.
LAW REFORM.(previous reference:Cabinet 17(38), Con-clusion 11.)17.       The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by *KeLord Chancellor (CP.285 (38)) seeking authority forthe drafting of a Bill with the object of carryingout, v/ith some modification, the recommendations contained in Part &quot;0&quot; (proposals for changes in the law/ relating to Consideration) and in Part &quot;D!! (jusquaestium tertio) of the Sixth Report of the law revision Committee (Cmd.  5449 of 1937).In the course of a short discussion theLORD CHANCELLOR explained that he was only asking for authority to carry out part of the recommendation contained in the Sixth Report of the Law RevisionCommittee, and that he thought that the proposals,while highly technical, were not likely to provecontroversial.The Cabinet agreed:-To authorise the drafting of a Billon the lines proposed by theLord Chancellor in his Memorandum.

The attention of the Cabinet was drawn tothe Law of Libel (Amendment) Bill, a Private Member&apos;bill introduced in the House of Commons and down for second Reading on Friday, 3rd February, 193C.THE LORD CHANCELLOR explained that this wasa highly technical subject, and that he did not yetfeel in a position to submit considered views to theCabinet in regard to it.     He v/as proposing goconsult Judgej and Members of the Bar familiar withthe subject and to make a further statement on thesubject to the Cabinet at a later date.

i^R-RAID 22,       THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that at their MeetingJsECAUTIONS.held on the 7th November the Cabinet had authorisedhelters.certain measures to accelerate defence preparations,Previous including Civil Defence measures.     One of the reference;cabinet 53        Conclusions reached at this Meeting had been:-38)conclusion 2), &quot;That the provision should be made, through theLocal Axtthorities, of blast-proof shelterfTi?.i&apos;(3^)j5&apos;- in existing buildings, by a survey and bystrengthening the roof of refuge-roomsin peace-time, and assembling material of the right dimensions for immediate action in an emergency,&quot;He proposed no change in this policy except in regardto the financial implications.     It was necessary, however,that he should make a statement in the House of Commons that day on a comprehensive policy in regard to shelters, and ashe proposed to include in that statement certain new materialhe thought it right to bring the matter to the noticeof his colleagues.The Lord Privy Seal proceeded to read out threeparagraphs from the proposed statement, explaining the new measures in contemplation.     These paragraphsare annexed as an Appendix to these Conclusions,.In the course of a short discussion THE LORD privy seal explained that these proposals were intended to relieve the pressure on public shelters, which should be used only by persons caught in the street.     Further considerationof the problem had convinced him that serious results would follow if large sections of the populationstreamed out of their houses to underground sheltersevery time an air-raid warning was given,,     Among othermatters, the problem of police protection would become an impossible one.The Lord Privy Seal explained that it was proposedto make steel shelters for 20 million people, at a costof  20 millions,,   This figure covered material only,
and he proposed that the cost of the material shouldhe home by the Exchequer,     The Local authorities would he responsible for the arrangements for storing theshelters and conveying thern to the places of erection.No cost of erection would be incurred.The Lord Privy Seal informed his colleagues thatthis new scheme had been worked out by three eminentengineers, who had been selected by the President of theInstitution of Civil Engineers, and he was satisfied thattheir advice v/as right and should be accepted.     The steelshelters could, of course, be covered at a later stage withrubble and earth,which -would greatly increase, the dejzree ofprotection affordedoTHE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR HOME affairs saidthat he had been convinced by the civil engineeringexperts that the scheme proposed was practical andwas one which should be adopted.The Cabinet took note of the statement made by the Lord Privy Seal.   -Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,31st December, 1958,
-APPENDIX,EXTRACT FROi,i STATEMENT TO 3E MADE BY THELORD PRIVY bEAL IE THE HOUSE OF COhUOKS,011 ./EDHESDAY, 218T DECEMBER,  1956.5. The hard core of the problem is, therefore, to provide protection for the ordinary citizen in, or close to, his ownhouse.     This is the problem on which my Department has beenconcentrating its attention since I undertook the responsibilityfor measures of Civil Defence, and I can now indicate to theHouse the lines on which the Government believe that asolution has been foundsThe method of protection must vary according to the type of the building and its surroundings.     In houses withbasements, the most practical means of providing shelteris to strengthen the basement; and v/e are making arrangements to produce a standardised fitting - consisting of light steelsheeting to be fastened to the ceiling joists of the basement,and steel supports to carry the weight from the strengthenedceiling to the level of the foundations.      The steel sheetswill be fixed in peace-time, but this will be done with theleast possible disturbance of peace-time user;    and the steelsupports can be stored and need not be put finally intoposition until an emergency arises.     In co-operation with thelocal authorities we shall carry out a survey to see to whichhouses this method can profitably be applied.In blocks of flats or tenements, the most satisfactoryvourse will be to provide structural support - either in thebasement or in the ground floor of the building - which will afford a shelter sufficiently large to accommodate the personsliving in the other papte of the building.     In buildingswhere an exceptionally large area can be strengthened in this1-
way   arrangements will be made to enable the shelter toserve, not only the people living in the building, but alsoothers living nearby for whom no other shelter is..available. Tothis extent these buildings will play their part in theprovision of public shelters.For houses without basements - primarily the two-storeyed house not very solidly constructed - we have, v/with the assistance of certain eminent members of the engineering-profession nominated by the President of the Institution ofCivil Engineers, and v/ith the co-operation of the steelindustry, evolved a special type of steel shelter which isin sections and can be easily put together, without anytechnical skill or professional assistance.      To secure themaximum degree of protection, this shelter should be placedoutside the house close to the house-wall - in a garden oryard - and should be sunk about tv/o feet in the ground, thedisplaced earth being piled up over the top of the steelframe.      In such a position it v/ould be readily accessiblefrom the house.6. And   now a word as to finance.     The provision of the equipment for these private shelters is not a matter whiohcould readily be undertaken by a number of local authoritiesup and dov/n the country.     It calls for central purchasingand central control.     The Government therefore propose to reserve to themselves the responsibility for accumulating theneoessary stocks of equipment, and so far as these privateshelters are concerned the Government will bear the whole costof the material.     We shall proceed at once to place ordersfor a very large quantity of steel equipment.     For thesmaller type of house we shall arrange for a supply of the
special steel shelters sufficient to afford protection for 10 million people;    and for the strengthening ofprivate basements material will be accumulated progressivelyas we proceed v/ith the necessary survey of the housoa tobe strengthened^     The cost of providing all this material,which will be borne entirely by the Exchequer, will be ofthe   order of  20,000,000.     This is a very large sum, butwe are satisfied that it is necessary expenditure and thereare two important considerations which can be offset againstthe ultimate net cost to the Exchequer.     First, theproduction of these large supplies of equipment will leadat once to increased employment in that part of the steelindustry, particularly the steel plate section, in whichthere is at present considerable unemployment because ithas been but little affected by the rearmament programmeoSecondly, if happily there should be no occasion to use this equipment for the purpose for which it was intended,all the steel left in the hands of the Government wouldhave a residual value, while the special shelters designed for the smaller type of house would have a considerablere-sale value.7. These shelters for the poorer sections of thepopulation in their own homes, will, as I have said, beprovided by the Exchequer;    but a balanced shelter policyis incomplete without the public shelter for persons caughtin the streets and those for whom protection cannot begiven in their own homes.     The duty of providing thesenecessary public shelters remains with the local authorities.It is still an urgent and an onerous duty;    but theGovernments decision to make this provision for privateshelters at the expense of the Exchequer will sensiblyreduce the burden which would otherwise rest on them.     TheGovernment therefore feel confident that they can look tothe local authorities even the poorer authorities, for they
are likely to benefit most from this new decision topress forward without delay with the provision of publicshelters to the fullest extent still necessary.,     TheExchequer contribution under the Act towards the cost ofthese public shelters will amount to several millionpounds;    and the whole programme which I have outlined is designed to provide protection for nearly 20 millionpe opleox: x x
