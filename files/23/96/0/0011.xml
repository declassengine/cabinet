9^0HINA. 1.     The Cabinet again had before them the followingjetance documents on the question of Assistance to China, onwhich a decision had been postponed at the Meetingsviousference: mentioned in the margin, pending a reply to enquiriesoinet 58B), Con- made of the United States Government :-conclusion 1).(a) A Memorandum by the Secretary of StatefTR (,o(3s)&amp;. for Foreign Affairs (CoP. 266(38)):(b) A Memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer (CP. 263(33))0THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat he v/as still awaiting an answer from the UnitedStates Government in regard to the proposed guarantee of 3 million for the purpose of stabilising the Chinesecurrency.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had spoken to theUnited States Ambassador shortly before the latterdeparted for his holiday in America.     He had explained to Mr. Kennedy that it would make a lot of difference to this country if the United States Government wereprepared to take parallel action in this matter, andthat he hoped that they would feel able to do so.     Mr.Kennedy had promised to exercise his influence in thisdirection.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat the Board of Trade and the Treasury were examining the possibilities of retaliatory action against Japan,and that the results of their investigation would be-available almost immediatelyoTHE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE pointed outthat the Japanese Press had got hold of the point that theI new powers in the Export Credits Bill were to be used togive oredits for the export of lorries to China; but itwas agreed that this was bound to become known, and thatno harm would result therefromo
The Cabinet agreed -To postpone a decision in regard tothe&quot;proposals set out in the Memorandumby the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs (CP. 266(58)) pending a replyto the enquiries made of the UnitedStates Government.
VISIT OP 2. THE SECRETARY OF STATE POP FOREIGN AFFAIRSILK. ships to TUNIS. reported that two of H.I.I. Ships were due to visitTunis between the 12th and 22nd January.     Thiswould synchronise with the visit to Rome of thePrime Minister and himself.     Although it wasvaluable that the Ships should go to Tunis, hethought that consideration should he given to some alteration in date.In the course of discussion the suggestion was&apos;made that the visit should be brought, fo-rward;   butit was felt that if this were done the French would say that the ships&apos; visit had been deliberatelytimed to take place before the journey to Rome, inorder to make it clear to the Italians that wewould stand by the French.     Other suggestions madewere that the visit should be postponed until afterthe reception in Rome, or that the date shovildremain unaltered but that the Ships should alsovisit some Italian ports on the same voyage.After discussion, the Cabinet agreed -That the question of -whether any alteration should be made in regardto the date of the proposed visit of two of II.H.- Ships to Tunis in1939 should be further consideredby the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs and the First Lord of theAdmiralty, who should report tothe Prime Minister.
VISIT of dr. SCHACHT.The JewishProblem.(previous reference:Cabinet 57(38), Con-elusion 8).3. THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat Dr. Schacht would be arriving that day in thiscountry, and that the ostensible pretext of his visit was to discuss the Jewish question.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER saidthat the inter-Governmental organisation attached importance to several matters in connection with theJewish problem being brought to Dr. Schacht1s notice.He undertook to send a note on these points to thePrime Minister  who had arranged to see Dr. Schacht onThursday, the 15th December.
ANGLO-GERMANNAVALAGREEMENT.(previous reference:Cabinet 50 (38)Conclusion 11).4. THE PIR3T LORD OP THE ADMIRALTY. .^a&apos;id thatthe German Ambassador had called on the PermcuientUnder-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs onMonday last and had said that Germany proposed toconstruct submarines up to 100 per cent(  of our strength and to convert tv/o 6-inch gun cruisers into8-inch gun cruisers.     Under the terms of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, Germany was entitled totake these steps in consultation with us.The First Lord feared that public opinionhere might take the view that Germany was nowdefinitely rearming against us and that there wasno hope of any real appeasement between the twocountries.      It appeared that Germany wished thather proposed action should not be made public,but it was clear that it would have to be notified to the other signatory   Powers.The First Lord said that the Foreign Officeproposed that we should inform the German Governmentthat the steps contemplated by them could only betaken in consultation with us and that we shouldbe prepared to confer v/ith them on the matter.The First Lord added that, if Germany builtsubmarines to the extent proposed, there mighthave to be a considerable increase in our destroyerstrength.     The Naval Staff took the view that we-ahou-ld-have two destroyers for every/german submarine.     We v/ould do what we could to reducethe extent of the new German building programme by scrapping old submarines.     As regards the cruisers, he was not aware that there was any real justification for the action proposed, sinceRussia had no 8-inch cruisers.
After discussion, the Cabinet agreed:-That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should he authorised tocommunicate with the German Governmenton the lines proposed, namely, that under the Anglo-German Naval Treaty, the steps proposed could only he taken inconsultation v/ith us, and that v/we should he prepared to confer on thematter with representatives of the GermanGovernmento
GERMANY.&apos; 5.   The Cabinet had under consideration a MostBritish Secret Memorandum by the Secretary of State forPropagandain. s   Foreign Affairs (CP.-284 (38)) putting forwardFR 6o(3g)i    Proposals with the object of ensuring that theBritish point of view is made known to the german public.   After describing the nature of the problem,the Secretary of State outlined a short-term policy,likely to produce quick results, under the following heads(a) Broad casting o(b) Personal Contacts.( c) A British Organisation in Germany.( d) Literature;and a long-term policy, which would take some timeto realise any striking results, mainly exerted inthe cultural and educational field.THE SECRETARY OP state FOR FOREIGN affairs said that these proposals arose out of the very general opinion that measures should be talcen tomake the British point of view known to the german public, and particularly out of a suggestion madeby the Prime Minister at a Meeting of the Foreign.P, 32nd Policy Committee that more use should be made of the$ting)Luxembourg Broadcasting Station.    He thought thatthe necessity for some such measures would be generally agreed, and that the case, need not be argued in detail.    He proposed, therefore, only toemphasise two or three points.The Secretary of State drew attention to the factthat,according to the best estimate available,Germany was able to spend some  5 millions ayear on propaganda.-       The corresponding figure for italy was  l  millions, while Prance spent about 1 million, for which she did not obtain a very good
return.    The &quot;best estimate which could be framed ofthe cost of the measures now proposed was some 50,000 a year.The Secretary of State thought that it would bea great mistake to under-estimate the importance ofthis side of our activities.    Indeed,  in his opinion the issue of peace and war might well turn on theextent to which v/e could make the British point ofview known.    By &quot;propaganda&quot; he did not mean attacks on other people, but a method of making known theBritish point of view as impartially, simply andimpressively as could be.The Secretary of State said that he had con-sidered the question whether a separate Ministry of propaganda should be set up.    Apart from the factthat this v/ould cost more money, he had rejected theidea on the ground that the creation of such aMinistry would render suspect whatever issued from it.    He thought the matter should be tackled quietly,without drawing attention to what v/e were doing.In conclusion,  the Foreign Secretary said thatthe matter was urgert and that he hoped the cabinet would given eneral approval in principle to his proposals, on the understanding that they v/ould be worked out in further detail.    He trusted that theTreasury would not look too jealously on minor items of expenditure on this head.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said that hewas agreeable to the proposal that the matter shouldbe investigated in further detail, but he hoped thatthe Cabinet would not give approval in principle toall the items in the Secretary of State&apos;s Memorandum.
While he attached great importance to personalcontacts, he thought that item (a)  (ii)  on page 2,under which it was proposed to have reciprocal talks between Germany and England,  required further investi-gation,    For example, he was sceptical of thepossibility of effecting any prelimi2iary arrangement with Germany, the object of which was to avoidprovocative remarks.The Chancellor of the Exchequer also drew attention to the fact that the money required for this service would have to be voted by Parliament, and he doubted whether it would be possible to avoid the government&apos;s interest in these matters being made known.    He also expressed some doubts whether weshould get value from the proposed extra grant tothe Travel Association to enable them to establish an   office in Berlin and other centres in Germany.THE MINISTER OP LABOUR AND THE SECRETARY OP STATEPOR AIR shared the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;sdoubts in regard to reciprocal broadcasts.    The latteralso thought that the need for action on the lines proposed generally was so important that we shouldnot be deterred by the fact that our action in thismatter would become known.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY drew attentionto the value of propaganda in neutral countries,which would pass from those countries to Germany,Some discussion took place as to the suitability of the News Department of the Foreign Office, as atpresent organised, for dealing with the wider func-tions which it was now proposed should be entrusted to them. Some doubts were expressed as to whether the guidance given by the News Department had alwaysbeen in complete harmony with Government policy.
Some comment v/as also made on the fact that Lord Lloyd,who v/as the President of the British Council and alsoChairman of the Travel Association, both organisationscharged v/ith Government propaganda duties under theproposed scheme, had on occasion been a severe criticof Government policy.THE PRIME IIIITISTER said that he attached greatImportance to broadcasts from the Luxembourg Station?which reached the popular radio sets in Germany.   As aninstance of what could be done from this Station hesaid that his speech to the Foreign press association the previous night had been specially relayed from theLuxembourg Station.    He said that he had given some little consideration to the question of setting up a propaganda Department, under a separate official head,to deal v/ith both home and foreign propaganda, but thathe had not however come to any definite conclusion orformulated any definite plan.THE SECRETARY CP STATE FOR FOREIGN APFAIRS agreed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer that item (a)(ii)of his Paper represented the most doubtful item in theprogramme now put forward.    &quot;Then he had discussed thequestion with ilr, Cgilvie he had been doubtful whetherthe suggestion was feasible,   Ilr. Ogilvie however thought thatthere were matters which the Germans would be willing tomake the subject of talks in an unprovocative way.He (the Foreign Secretary) agreed that this question should be further discussed,.
tj 3 3As regards the question whether the Governmentsparticipation in broadcasts from Iuxembourg, etc., wouldbecome known, he had thought that the cost of thesebroadcasts mi^ht, perhaps, be financed through the british council and the- fact of Government participation effectively-concealed.    The Chancellor of thu Exchequer interposed that many people in this country woul^: listen to these broadcasts,and that questions v/ould at once be asked as to v/ho paid for them.Continuing, THE FOREIGK SECRETARY said that the travel Association&apos;s publicity embraced not merely the attractions of particular resort,, but general publicity in regard to British everyday life.As regards the instrument for carrying outGovernment propaganda, he was saisfied that the government policy in this matter must be un..jr the general direction ofthe Foreign Office, and he accepted full responsibility forwhatever emanated from the News department of the ForeignOffice.    He thought that it would  be very unjust,  thatmerely became Lord Lloyd was a critic of the government&apos;s policy   in certain respects,the  ?value of the publicity workwhich he had undertaken for this country should in any waybe under-rated.    He /undertook, however, to bear this pointin mind, if a convenient opportunity&apos; ity arose, and to discussthe matter with Lord Lloyd.The Cabinet agreed -(i)   That the proposa s in the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs&apos; Memorandumon British Propaganda in Germany(CP.  284 (38)) should be subject to detailed investigation by representativesof the Treasury and the Foreign office as rapidly as possible, with a view tothe formulation of proposals of a mostspecific character.(ii)   That the result of this examination shouldbe reported to t,he Cabinet in. time forconsideration at the Meeting to be heldon Wednesday, 2.1 st December.
$STINE. 6.      THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS ANDstations FOR THE COLONIES said that a telegram had beenthe Londoninference. despatched to Ibn Saud some days ago, urging on himivious the importance of securing that the delegates of theJerence:linet 58 (38)     Palestinian Arabs to the London Conference were fully elusion 6).representative of the different sections of opinion among their people. No reply to this telegram had yet been received.tigration of The Jewish Agency had recently reauested that,ishIdren. in view of the treatment of Jews in Germany, we should.   , ,i      agree to allow 21,000 Jews, over and above the nresentimmigration quota, to enter Palestine.     This number was made up of 11,000 adults and 10,000 children.There could be no question of allowing the adults toenter Palestine, but the question of the children, onwhich he had been strongly pressed, was more difficult.There were homes available for all the 10,000 children and there was no doubt that they could be received inPalestine without causing injury to anyone1 s interest. Therewere, however,  other points which must be considered.In the first place, the High Commissioner at Jerusalemand the British representatives in the neighbouring arab States had all said that, if these 10,000 childrenwere allowed to enter Palestine, we should run aconsiderable risk that the Palestinian Arabs would notattend the Conference;  and that, if they did attend, their confidence would be shaken and the atmosphere damage on the other hand, Dr. Weizmann had threatenedthat,  if this demand were not conceded, the jewish agency&apos;s acceptance of the invitation to the london conference would be withdrawn.     He had seenDr. Weizmann on the matter on the 12th&apos;December and again that morning.
The Secretary of State said that he would haveto answer? c. quo:., j: or:, on the matte:.&apos; that afternoon inthe House of Commons.     Pic proposed to answer/cr onthe following lines;    that the Government had invitedrepresentatives of the Palestinian Arabs, theGovernments of neighbouring countries and the jewish agency to come to London for discussions on future policy for Palestine,  including immigration;    that.m. Government had refused to accede to requests to stop immigration completely pending the discussions, as this would prejudice one of the matters to be discussed at the Conference;    that for the same reasoir theycould not give authority to the immediate additionalimmigration of 10,000 young Jews;    but that this didnot mean that the request v/as permanently refused,since immigration would be considered in the course ofthe London discussionso      In the meantime, providedthat the existing refugee organisations could guaranteetheir maintenance, the children could be brought to thiscountry.      He also pointed out that a certain number of jewish children were already going to educationalinstitutions in Palestine under the existingimmigration quota,THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR INDIA said he was satisfied that the admission of these 10,000 children to Palestine at the present time would have a veryadverse effect on Moslem opinion-     The High Commissionerfor India had reported that it was commonly believed inIndia that v/e v/ere prepared to agree to stop Jewishmigration into Palestine, since otherwise v/e should nothave invited the representatives of the neighbouring arab States to a Conference.     There was,  of course, no justification for this view, but the fact that it washeld was significant,,
THE HOME SECRETARY said that he was prepared, for the time &quot;being, to allow immigrationfacilities to this country to Jewish children,provided that the organisations concerned couldguarantee their maintenance here.In the course of discussion, it wassuggested that it might be necessary to make some further concession, in order to avoid violentconflict with the Jews in Palestine;    it waspointed out, however,  that any departure from theprinciple laid down by the Home Secretary mighthave very far-reaching consequences.THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGN affairs thought that, in view of the advice received from our representatives abroad,  the Secretary ofState for the Dominions and the Colonies had no alternative but to adopt the course which he had outlined.      The fact must be faced that it was essential that we should reach agreement withthe Arabs over the   Palestine question.     At thesame time it should be recognised that thePalestine problem was insoluble unless it couldbe made part of a bigger setting.     It wastherefore imperative that we should proceed asvigorously as possible to consider the largerproblem of Jewish re-settlement as a whole.     Hesuggested that, while we should adhere for thetime being to the policy in regard to refugeesoutlined by the Home Secretary, we must beprepared to make some departure from that policywhen further schemes of Jewish settlement hadbeen worked out.
THE PRIME MINISTER and THE SECRETARY of state POR DOMINION AFFAIRS AND FOR THE COLONIESexpressed the view that the Jews v/ere not in aposition to carrjr out their threat of withdrawing from the London Conference, and would not infact do so.The Cabinet agreed to the line whichthe Secretary of State for DominionAffairs and for the Colonies proposedto take in regard to the suggestionthat 10,000 Jewish children should forthwith be admitted to Palestine,namely, that this request could notbe granted at the present time, butthat the matter was one which shouldbe discussed at the London Conference.
?CIAL 7.      THE MINISTER OP TRANSPORT said that he hoped ON OF)AILWAYS. &quot;before next week&apos;s meeting of the Cabinet to circulateKous a paper setting out his considered reflections on the[jence:Iiet 49 (35)     railway position.     He wished, however, to take thislusion 6).opportunity of introducing the matter to the notice of&apos;  his colleagues.The railways had never been within sight of earning the standard revenue contemplated in the post-war settlement of the railway problem,.     Last year theyhad earned  38 million, as compared with the standardrevenue of  51-g- million.     This year their earnings would fall to abO&quot;*.t  28 million,      The result would bethat, whereas in 1937  78 million of railway capitalreceived no dividend whatever,  in 1938 some  416 million of capital would receive no dividend.The Minister of Transport thought that it wouldbe agreed that the railways constituted the ironbackbone of the State and were essential to thecommunity, alike in peace and war.     While the need for maintaining the railways was self-evident, it was muchmore difficult to say how this end was to be secured.The railway companies&apos; propaganda dealt mainjyin very general terms, such as freedom and equality.In effect, what they wished to do v/as to free^ themselves from the statutory conditions which at presents/obligedthem to publish their rates and prevented themdiscriminating as between one trader and another.     Ifa trader rang up on the telephone, and said that he wanted so many tons of goods carried betv/een two places,the railway managers wished to be free to use their owncommercial judgment in the answer they gave.
Such procedure would he contrary to a hundred years of railway experience.     He was clear that no solution of the problem could be found which did not include certain necessary safeguards, together withsome form of control and some provision for appeals bythe consumer.     For example, if the railways weregiven complete discretion they could refuse to carry acolliery company1s coal, if that company allowed asingle ton to be carried by road.     This v/ould .ineffect give the Hallway Companies a virtualstranglehold over the Coal Industry.     At the sametime the Minister said that he v/as satisfied that therailways were handicapped to a certain extent byantiquated forms of control.      He had, therefore,remitted the Railway Companies1 request to the transport advisory Council and, in doing so, he had given them ahint that the Railway Companies&apos;  request should not bemet by complete refusal.In conclusion the Minister said that if theRailway Companies were given a blank refusal in thismatter they were quite capable of reducing their services and of making reductions in wages.     Thiswould involve a real risk of a railway strike.The Minister said that he was not without hopethat it would be possible to afford the railways aconsiderable measure of relaxation from restriction.At the same time such relaxation must deal fairly withthe consumer, must provide for a right of appeal andmust include some modernisation of the conception of a--common.....ca rrJLegy 1
o o **The Minister gave an instance of the absurdresults of the present system, namely a case where someheavy and very bulky machinery had been brought downby road from the north.      The road companies made aconsiderable charge on account of the precautions whichhad had to be taken to ensure safe transit.     Ondelivery the empty crates had been sent back by goodstrain at the exceptionally low railway rates for returnempties which are based on the assumption that profitabletraffic had passed.The Minister of Transport undertook to submit a considered statement and provisional suggestions to thefollowing week&apos;s meeting of the Cabinet.The Cabinet took note of the Minister of transports statement.
NATIONALFITNESSGRANTS .(previous reference:Cabinet 11(37), Con-elusion 11.)8.       The Cabinet had before them, a Memorandum bythe President of the Board of Education ( CP.-283(38)) setting forth arguments to show that if theNational Fitness Movement was to continue effective-ly an additional sure of  3 millions would be requiredto be made available over a further three years ending at March, 1943, for capital grants for physical training and recreation, and for the extra cost of the National College of Physical Training.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF EDUCATIONreminded his colleagues &quot;that the scheme had been in being for about eighteen months.     Owing, however,to the time taken to get the organisation working,the scheme had only been in effective operation forsome eight or nine months.      It was clear that thescheme had taken root to a far greater extent than had hitherto been generally appreciated, and theneed for grants was correspondingly greater.      broadly speaking the grants averaged about one-third of thecapital cost of each scheme.The President referred to the main points inthe   financial position as summarised in his memorandum.      Broadly, the position was that if he accepted the offer made by the Chancellor of theExchequer to make a further allocation of  1,200,000over and above the provisional estimate of  2,400,000,it would be necessary for him to say at once thatno further applications could be received.     Theresult would be that when the total grant had been allocated the whole machinery for developingfacilities for physical fitness would have to be disbanded.     He thought his colleagues would recognise that this would be an impossible situation.The reason for the passage of the physical Training
9 07o* 3 (mand Recreation Aot, 1937, had been the necessity for providing these facilities if we were to ensure properphysical training and recreation for young people.     Hehad, therefore, reached the conclusion that if thescheme was to continue in operation up till March 1943it would be necessary to provide an additional  3,000,000for capital grants, over and above the original estimateof  2,400,000.     At the same time he hoped that it wouldbe possible to effect substantial savings in certaindirjsotions, e.g. administration and contraction methods.THE MINISTER POR CO-ORDINATION OP DEFENCE saidthat   in his capacity as Chairman of the GrantsCommittee of the National Playing Fields Associationhe was responsible for considering grants for playing fields under the National Fitness Campaign.     the grants varied from 25 to 50 per cent, of the cost, theiacger grants- be-ing paid in the case of the poorerauthorities.     Most of these grants have been madeto local authorities.     He had recently been informedthat the National Fitness Council had set aside afurther  50,000 making  200,000 in all for grants forplaying fields.     While he was grateful to the council for placing this sum at the disposal of the Committee,he expressed doubts whether the making of a grant fromthe National Fitness Council towards the provision ofplaying fields by local authorities was in all casesthe determining factor in the provision of new playing fields.     He emphasised that cases submitted to his committee had all been previously approved by theNational Fitness Council.     He suggested that it mightbe desirable that he and the Secretary to his Committeeshould discuss this matter with the President of theBoard of Education.
O J 0THE CHANCELLOR OR THE EXCHEQUER said thatwhen the Act had been passed it had been estimatedthat the total capital expenditure involved,including the National Training College, would he 2,400,000.    It had never been suggested that this sum should be made available as an immediateallocation, and that a further unspecified sumshould be made available later on.    There was no assurance that the  3,000,000 now asked forrepresented all that would ultimately be demanded.The Chancellor of the Exchequer proceeded to give some figures of the expenditure which had been incurred:-Grants to local authorities forswimming baths ....  341,000.Grants to local authorities forplaying fields *  148,000.Grants for social and recreativecentres . .  274,000.The position was that the Committee had l^cu^j^cL-speaafe/ l million and that they were aware of requests on a corresponding scale for another one and three-quarter millions.- The Chancellor of the Exchequer thoughtit was clear that this matter must be dealt withon the basis of selecting the most useful and valuable schemes, and the total sum which could bemade available must be allocated to the best advantage.    It was impossible to proceed on thebasis pf making grants indefinitely in respect ofall the schemes which were submitted to theCommittee.   He regretted that he did not see his way
to agree to the President of the Board&apos;s proposal that afurther sum of  3 millions should he made available over thethree years ending March, 1943.    He had, however,  offered anadditional grant of  1,200,000 which represented a 5C/foincrease over the original estimate.THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR SCOTLAND said that theadditional amount proposed by the Chancellor, viz,  1,200,000,if divided between Scotland and England as suggested by thePresident of the Board of Education, would meet immediateforeseeable commitments, but would leave only a small marginover and it would soon be necessary to close down ouractivities.In the course of further discussion, the Ministerof Health said that a good deal of time had been spent in getting into touch with voluntary organisations.    It would bevery undesirable to take any action which would stop the co-operation of these organisations up and down the country.THE PRESIENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE said that he sharedto a considerable degree the views of the Chancellor of theExchequer in this matter, and that it had not been the original intention that a large proportion of the money should go ingrants to local authorities.    He had been impressed with theamount which could be done for a relatively small expenditurein building a hall or improving an existing building for a boys&apos;club.    He referred to the fact that the law had been alteredso as to enable the Board of Education to provide gymnasia notmerely for schools, but also for adults.    At the same time hewould much regret any action would would lead to the collapse of so promising a movement.He thought that what had really happened had beenthat the local authorities were in a better position than otherapplicants to submit forms of application.    They had thereforegot their applications in first, and the Committee, impressed with the delay which had occurred in getting ihe asheme going, had
/2 9 odealt somewhat too lavishly with the localauthorities&apos;  applications.THE FIRST LORD OF TH^ ADMIRALTY.suggestedthat consideration should he given to the question.,whether it was not cheaper for the State to buildswimming baths by means of grants from a NationalFitness Council than as part of the school equipment,in which case a 50fS grant would be paid.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had beenalarmed to learn that the whole sum estimated to be required for capital expenditure had alreadybeen mortgaged, and that a substantial excess was involved.    It was clear that the money had been spent in quite different directions to those whichhe had contemplated when he had been concerned withthe scheme at its inception.    He thought that itwas clearly desirable that the matter should now be examined afresh with a view to determination of the basis on which grants should be a!located in future.    Pending examination, he thought thatthe Cabinet would not wish to reach a decisionon the question raised in the President&apos;s Memorandum,namely, the amount to be made available for grantsover the three years ending March, 1943.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF EDUCATIONpointed out that playing fields, swimming bathsand gymnasia were the items specifically mentionedon page 6 of the White Paper issued in January,1937, dealing with Physical Training and Recreation(Cmd. 5634).    It would not therefore be fair to criticise the Committee for having made grants in aid of these items.   He was, however, willing that- 23 -
the matter should he further discussed on thelines proposed.The Cabinet agreed:-(i)   That the Chancellor of the exchequer should convene a meeting of himself,the President of the Board ofEducation, the Minister of health and the Secretary of State forScotland, with their adv-isers, todetermine the basis on which grants should be made in future under theNational Fitness Scheme, and the sumwhich should be made available forsuch grants over and above theprovisional estimate of  2,400,000.(ii)   Pending a report from this Conference,to postpone a decision on theproposal contained in the Memorandumby the President of the Board ofEducation (CP.  283 (38)).

The Eill should follow the general lines of Annex Ito C,Pc-281 (36)cThe Committee understood that it would, be possibleto circulate a draft Bill as soon as a cabinet decision had been taken, for consideration by theCommittee of Home Affairs.    They also suggestedthat they should be authorised, to arrange for theintroduction of the Bill, after approval by theHome Affairs Committee, without further referenceto the Cabinet 0
THE LOPvD CHANCELLOR said that it was now expectedthat Judgment in the Borders case would bo deliveredbefore Christmas and that the Judge would hold thatthe practice of Building Societies in making advanceson additional security was ultra vireso     If this happened, a serious situation v/ould result, and if some-thing like a panic, leading to a complete stoppage inthe building of small houses, was to be avoided, it wouldbe necessary for an immediate statement to be made.   he invited the attention of his colleagues to the draft announcement prepared with this end in view (Annex II to cp. 281(38)).The Lord Chancellor continued that if legislation was to be introduced to validate this practice, it was clearly necessary that the Building Societies shoxildput&apos; their house in order.     It had been significant thatthe representatives of the larger and more reputableBuilding Societies, who had been seen by the members ofthe official Committee, had been willing not only to acton the suggestions put to them, but even to go further.The Lord Chancellor thought that it was onlynecessary to invite the attention of his colleagues toone of the recommendations of the Cabinet Committee asto the provisions of the Bill.     This concerned thequestion of what provision should be made in regard tothe period of repayment of the advance.     On this matteropinion had been considerably divided.     The general practice of the better Societies was that the period of repayment of the advance should not exceed 21 years.This course was advantageous from the point of view ofthe economy of the Building Socieites.     It also ensuredthat a substantial value attached to the houses whenthe period of repayment came to an end.- 28 -
On the other hand, there were a number of building societies who were prepared to lend money with a periodof repayment extending to 25 or in some cases SO years.The difference in rental between the repayment period of21 and 25 years on an average price house was as much as/- a week.     There was no doubt that insistence on a21 years1 period of repayment would result in the stoppage of a certain amount of house-building.(At this point the Lord President ofthe Council and the Secretary of otatefor India left the meeting).In the course of the discussion, it was pointedout that there were three possible courses on this matter(a) a limit of 21 years, (b) a limit of 25 years,  (c) no provision in the Bill to deal with the period of repay-ment.     The general view expressed was that the periodof repayment af 21 years was too restrictive and shouldnot be insisted upon.     Importance was attached,especially by the Secretary of State for Scotland, tono step being taken which would interfere with theprogramme of building at the present time.     It was alsofelt that insistence on a period of 21 years would resultin opposition to the Bill by the representatives of an association of the smaller Building Societies which hadbeen formed some eighteen months ago as the result of a&quot;breakaway from the main association.The Cabinet agreed -To the following action in the event of a judgment unfavourable to the existing practice of Building Societies being-delivered in the Borders case:-(1)   That a statement of Government policy should be issued at once on the linesof the draft contained in xuuiex II tothe Report of the Cabinet Committee(CP. 281(38)).
That if Judgment is delivered in the borders case while the House of Commonsis sitting, this statement should he made in the House, hut if Parliament wasnot sitting the statement should heissued to the Press as a statement ofGovernment policy *To approve the introduction, with theleast possible delay after delivery of Judgment in the Borders case, of aBill to validate and regulate building societies&apos; practicesThat this Bill should follow thegeneral line of Annex I to the Reportof the Cabinet Committee (O.P. 231(53)),subject to the exception in the ensuing-paragraph.That no provision should be included inthe draft Bill in regard to the periodof repayment of advances.That authority should be given forthe introduction of the Bill, after its approval by the Committee of HomeAffairs, without further reference tothe Cabinet.
AGRICULTURAL 11. The Cabinet had under consideration-a memo -ooLICY.randum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheriesbutton andlamh. (CP.-286 (38)) describing the present seriousRegulation depression in the sheep industry in the United,of Imports .Kingdom and asking authority, on grounds fully(Previous outlined in his Memorandum, to the issue forthwithReference:Cabinet 31        of an Order under Section 11 of the Livestock(38), Con-clusionr3.)       Industry Act, 1937, with a view to the regulationF.tR.i-u-(?q)0jof imports of mutton and lamb from all sources, asfrom the beginning of 1939.   Such an Order would bein general terms, and would allow for variation inthe quantities to be imported from time to tine inaccordance with the needs of the market oTHE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES, in introducing this Memorandum emphasised the extent towhich sheep formed the vital part of farming enter-prise in this country.      In his view it was essentialto res-hore confidence in the sheep industry by making an Order under Section 11 of the Livestock industry act, 1937 for the purpose of regulating the importsof mutton and lamb from all sources, as from the be-ginning of 1939.     At the present time 2.0% of theimports came from foreign countries under regulation,whilst the remaining 80$ came from the Dominions andwas not the subject of any effective regulation.The Minister said that the Empire Beef Counciland the International Beef Conference which had been set up to deal with beef and veal, worked satisfactorily.Efforts had been made to obtain the co-operation
of Australia and New Zealand in the formation of aproducers&apos; commodity council for regulating suppliesof mutton and lamb to the United Kingdom Market asfrom the beginning of 1939.     Australia had expressed general sympathy, but the New Zealand Government,notwithstanding the patient attitude which had beenadopted, had refused to co-operate.     The matter hadbeen explained to the New Zealand Government in a despatch dated 4th October, 1938, which had been followed by a telegram dated 25th Noveniber, towhich a reply had nov: been received confirming theprevious refusal,,The Minister said that he was subject to heavy and continuous pressure in this matter, and he was most anxious to make an announcement before theParliamentary Recess which v/ould restore confidence in the sheep industry.He thought that there were grounds for theview that if New Zealand once realised that we meantbusiness in the matter, she would be willing toco-operate.     The only alternative course proposed would be a subsidy to the sheep industry, which ha(the Minister) had alv/ays resisted. &apos;THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION affairs and FOR THE COLONIES said that while he had some doubts whether the proposed Order under the LivestockIndustry Act, 1937, would provide as effective a remedy as the Minister of Agriculture and Fisherieshoped, he did not dissent in principle from the proposal that the Minister should make such an Order.     Hethought, however, that this should not be done without
a few days&apos; grace, which would enable us to warnAustralia and New Zealand of the action proposed.     Weshould tell both Dominions that the attitude ofNew Zealand left us with no alternative but to make anOrder, which we should do in a few days&apos; time.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD CP TRADE said thathe would not feel any difficulty about the course proposed, if he thought that it would provide any realhelp to the sheep industry.     He was afraid, however,that while the publication of the Order might lead tosome temporary improvement of the position, after a time it would be found that the Order made no differenceat all in the price of home produced mutton and lamb.He pointed out that whereas the price of home grownmutton and lamb had slumped heavily,, the price of theNew Zealand or Australian product had remained veryStable.THE MINISTER OP AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIESinterposed that the latest reports showed someslackening of demand for the Dominion product and someeasing in prices, for whiaii the low prices of the homeproduct were said to be responsible.Continuing, the PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OP trade said that while the step proposed might be a necessarycorollary to any action taken to improve the position ofthe sheep industry, he gravely doubted whether taken by itself, it would provide any satisfactory or effectivesolution.     Hitherto the home product had commanded ahigher price than the Dominion prodvact but he thoughtthat the time might be coming when the margin which had hitherto existed between the price of the home and ofthe Dominion products would tend to disappear.     He- 33 -
agreed that if the price of the Dominion product was forced up to a considerable extent, the price of thehome grown product might rise in sympathy, but he doubted whether the increase in the price of home produced mutton and lamb would be substantial unlessthe price of the corresponding Dominion products were forced up to such an extent that people would considerpurchasing beef instead of mutton and lamb,THE MINISTER OP AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES saidthat he was satisfied that the making of the proposed order was an essential step in restoring the position ofthe sheep industry, although he agreed that it was notthe only step which would be required.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said thathe shared the views expressed by the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries, and thought that the stepproposed would have an effect on home prices.     Further,he was satisfied that we should be in an impossible position if it became known that we had invited theNew Zealand Government to co-operate in regulatingimports and that on their refusal to co-operate we hadtaken no effective action to deal v/ith the matter.The Cabinet a greed:-(i)   That the proposals in the Memorandum by theMinister of Agricxilture and Fisheries(CP, 286 (58)) in regard to the regulationof imports of mutton and lamb should be remitted to the Committee on agricultural policy for further consideration,(ii)   That the Committee on Agricultural policy should have authority to reach a decisionon this matter without further reference tothe Cabinet.
]HE BACONINDUSTRY(AMENDMENT)BILL.(previous reference:Cabinet 58(38) , Con-conclusion IS.)12.    The Cabinet had under consideration a joint memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fish-eries and the Secretary of State for Scotland (H.A.-41 (38))  covering the draft Bacon Industry (Amendment)Bill, the irain objects of which were to incorporatea lard price insurance plan in the financial provi-sions of Section 28 of the principal Act&quot;,    and alsoto deal vith the production of bacon from importedpigs, and. the verification of claims for subsidy onaccount of variations in the ascertained bacon price:together with the following recommendation thereon by the Committee of Home Affairs (H.A.O. 20th Con-elusions (38)) :-&quot;To authorise the introduction forthwith in the House of Commons of the BaconIndustry (Amendment) Bill, in the formof the draft annexed to H.A.-41 (38),subject to any drafting or other minor amendments that may be found necessary or desirable.&quot;THE MINISTER OP AGRICULTURE AND fisheries said that the only point which had been reservedat the Home Affairs Committee concerned thequestion whether it was desirable to referspecifically in the Bill to &quot;boxed American lard&quot;.It had been suggested that the reference to Americanlard would give colour to the view that the schemeto incorporate a lard price insurance plan in thefinancial provisions of Section 8 of the principalAct was designed to meet the tariff concession madein the Anglo-American Trade Agreement.     This point was being further considered.The Cabinet approved the above recommendation of the Committee ofHome Affairs.

The Bill was, therefore,  one which theGovernment should support.The Cabinet agreed -That the adoption of Children(Regulation) Bill should be supported by the government spokesman.

The subject-matterof the Bill, hov/ever, was extremely controversial,and he thought that it was desirable that theGovernment should not take any line in regard to amatter of this kind unless (as did not appear to bethe case in the present instance) public opinion was crystallised in favour of action on certainlines.     Personally he would not feel embarrassed ifthe Bill were given a Second Reading.The Cabinet agreed:That if the Contraceptives(Regulation) Bill was discussed onFriday, the Government spokesman should avoid expressing any definiteopinion in regard to it.
