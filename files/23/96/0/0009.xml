ANGLO-french conversations.(previous reference:Cabinet 56(38), Con-clusion 1).22?K* \j ,v1,      The Cabinet had before them a Most&apos; secret memorandum by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs (CP. 269 (38)) circulating a record ofthe Anglo-French conversations in Paris on the24th November, which had ranged over the following subjects:-The Franco-German Agreement.Anglo-French Defence Measures.The Jewish Question.Franco-Italian Relations.Czechoslovakia and Central Europe.Roumania.Franco-Russian Relations.Economic Action in Central Europe.**-7 (3^)1*-* The Far East.The Suez Canal.Colonies.THE PRIME MINISTER said that there was little which he need add to the record that hadbeen circulated.    The Foreign Secretary and hehad,  of course,  given much thought to the questionwhich they had anticipated might be made to themby French Ministers,  and the answers which theyshould give.    In the course of the conversations,however, no point of difficulty had arisen exceptin regard to the proposed guarantee to Gzechoslo-slovakia (see the ensuing Conclusion).
CZECHOSLOVAKIA,Guarantee to.(previous reference:Cabinet 55(38), Con-clusion 6).2.      THE PRIME MINISTER said that at the Anglo-French Conversations the French Ministers hadtaken the line that our proposal for a joint guarantee by four Powers,  to come into force asthe result of a decision by any three of the four powers, was not consistent with the obligations which the French Government had undertaken.Finally, however, they had accepted the view which he had advanced, namely,  that the best wayto handle the problem would be to ascertain whether the Czechoslovak Government were willingto accept an arrangement on the lines of HisMajesty&apos;s Governments proposals the SECRETARY OF ST.Vx&apos;E FuR HOME AFFAIRS saidthat this proposal was some way removed from theearlier proposal that France,  Russia and thiscountry should give a joint guarantee to Czecho-slovakia ana that Germany and Italy should signseparate Non-Aggression Pacts with Czechoslovakia.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that this v/as so.    He explained that theKing of Roumania had invited our views in regardto Russia, and that the alternative courses inconnection with the proposed guarantee to czechoslovakia had been explained.    King Carolhad stated that lie was definitely opposed toRussia being one of the joint guarantors.The Foreign Secretary s.aid that he had explained to the King of Roumania that it wasimpossible for this country to take any action with a view to preventing Russia being one of
the guarantor Powers, first, because of R&apos;ussia&apos;sexisting Treaty obligations,  and,  second, becauseon general grounds it v/as undesirable to take any action which appeared to give Russia the cold shoulder.He (the Foreign Secretary) had also had some discussion about the position of Russiawith the French Ministers.    It v/as clear thatthey were rather anxious to disentangl3 them-selves from the Russian connection.    M. Bonnethad said that in September russia had hoped that war would break out, but that in that event russia would have kept largely aloof and hoped to profitby the general confusion.Continuing, the Foreign Secretary said that both the French Ministers and the King of Roumaniawere certain that Germany would not agree to be associated in any v/ay v/ith Russia in the proposed guarantee to Czechoslovakia.,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HOME AFFAIRS agreedthat in these circumstances the earlier proposal which he had mentioned could no longer be pressed.At the same time he thought that King Carol&apos;s view as to Russia should be accepted with some caution0In the course of further discussion the PRIMEMINISTER said that he was clear that Germany wouldnot acquiesce in any arrangement which allowedRussia to be associated with Czechoslovakia.Germany would, no doubt, make this attitude quite clear to Czechoslovakia, who would have no choicein the matter.
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat, in his view, the dangers v/hich the guaranteev/as intended to guard against were largely hypothet-ical.    At the same time it v/as desirable that weshould avoid, if possible, a position in v/hich we might find ourselves asked to take action with france and Russia against Germany and Italy onbehalf of a State v/hich we were unable effectively to defend.THE MINISTER OF HEALTH thought that the reper-cussions on home politics of our attitude in thismatter should not be forgotten.    It was very undesirable that we should exercise any pressure on the Czechoslovak Government to abandon Russia&apos;sguarantee to that country.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed that it was under-irable that any pressure should be brought to bearon Czechoslovakia by this country in this matter.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS ex-plained that a draft telegram had been preparedinviting the views of the Czechoslovak Governmenton the subject.He suggested that the telegram might be con-sidered by the Foreign Policy Committee inconnection with CP.  258(38), which had alreadybeen referred to the Cabinet (see Cabinet 55(38)Conclusion 6).The Cabinet agreed -That the draft telegram inviting the views of the czechoslovak government as to the form of theproposed guarantee should bereferred to the Foreign PolicyCommittee, which should beauthorised to reach a decisionon the matter without further reference to the Cabinet.
CZECHOSLOVAKIA.3.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUERSR said, thatGrant ofFinancialAssistance to.proposed loan to Czechoslovakia.he was hecoming daily more disturbed about theThe primary(previous previous reference:Cabinet 55(38)Conclusion 7).purpose of the assistance granted had been for therelief of refugees.It was becoming more andmore difficult to justify expenditure on otherobjects. He was by no means certain that there might not be a case for limiting to  10 millionsthe total sum to be advanced to Czechoslovakia.The Cabinet agreedThat the Foreign Policy Committee shouldbe asked to examine further and toreport to the Cabinet in regard to theextent of the financial assistance tobe granted to Czechoslovakia and thepurposes for which such assistance was required.
GERMAN-CZECH 4. THE MINISTER CP TRANSPORT asked theFRONTIER.--- Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether he reported could add to the information which had appeared in themobilisationof German Press as to mobilisation of German troops near theTroops.Czechoslovak frontier.(previous reference: THE SECRETx-RY CF STATE PGR FOREIGN AFFAIRSCabinet 56 (38)Conclusion 2).    said that, at the moment, he had nothing to add tothe information contained in Telegram No. 735 fromSir G. Ogilvie Forbes at Berlin.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY and THESECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that their Departmentsreceived information in the same sense as what had appeared in the newspapers.Discussion ensued as to the reasons whichhad prompted this concentration of troops,  (assuming that it had taken place).    It was suggested thatGermany might have intended to march troops throughCzechoslovakia proper into Ruthenia, in order to havea jumping point for some adventure in the Ukraine.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY undertook to takethe necessary steps to examine the authenticity ofthese reports.It
[AIN. 5. THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGN AFFAIRStention of referred to the detention in Palma of cargo shipsips underitish chartered by this country and carrying to thisarter byneral Franco.     country Roumanian wheat purchased by His Majesty&apos;srevious Government.     A telegram had been despatched onef erence *cabinet 56 (33)   Monday to Palma and Burgos complaining of theanclusion 1)       detention of the ships and asking for theiry immediate release. As no action had been takento release the ships a further telegram had been dispatched to Burgos the previous night-,The Foreign Secretary said that he thoughtGeneral Franco would give way, but he had asked theAdmiralty to consider what action could be takento secure the release of these ships if he did not do so.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said thatthe matter had not been fully considered by theAdmiralty, but, at first sight, the Admiralty were disposed to think that possible action to securethe release of foreign ships (in this case greek ships) from a foreign port, on the grounds thatthe ships were carrying British cargo, might involve us in awkward complicationsoIn the discussion which ensued, it wassuggested that, although of course there was no justification for the action taken by General Franco,it might not nevertheless be right for us to takeforcible action to secure the release, not merely ofBritish cargoes, but of foreign hullso     On theother hand,, it was pointed out that., according to our
own war practice, the fact that a ship had been charteredby a given country had been regarded as the determining factor.It was also suggested that our prestige in theMediterranean would suffer if we did not take vigorousaction to secure the release of these ships.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs expressed the view that the action taken v/as probably ablunder on the part of Franco&apos;s ships, and that, as soonas news of what had occurred reached General Franco, theships would be released.   He thought that these difficulties would be avoided for the future if it v/aspossible for the Nationalist authorities to be informed of theposition in the Western Mediterranean not only ofBritish ships, but also of foreign ships under charter to this country.It v/as agreed that if no news had been received in the course of the early afternoon that the ships hadbeen released,! the answer to &quot;he given to a parliamentary question that afternoon /should be tha  we should oroceed-/Lit, ^jc^xJU-to take the necessary action to secure the--roIeaae--&amp;jg&apos;-tfeese^hftps-.The Cabinet agreed:(l)   That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should consult further with theFirst Lord of the Admiralty as to v/hataction could properly be taken to securethe release of the ships, if they werenot released within a short time.(2)    That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs and the President of the Boardof Trade should consult as to the possibilityof informing the Nationalist authorities of movements, not only of British ships, but of ships under British charter.

013 IVISIT OP THEPRIME MINISTERAND THEFOREIGN SECRETARYTO signor mussolini.(previous reference cabinet 5U(38),Conclusion 5)*7. The Prime Minister said that at MunichSignor Mussolini had expressed the wish that thePrime Minister should visit Italy*      Some weeks ago he had discussed the matter with the foreign secretary and they had reached the conclusionthat, as the prospects of appeasement were notvery bright in Berlin, it might be useful thatthey should visit Rome-      They had agreed,however, that they should first pay a visit to paris, and that a suitable interval should follow.The visit, including the journeys out and home, would take not less than a week-      In thesecircumstances it v/as clearly desirable that the visit should take place during the ParliamentaryRecess;    and this pointed to a date in January.Lord Perth had put the matter forward to count Cianc as a personal suggestion from himself.Count Ciano, while expressing himself as delighted,had said it would be necessary to consult signor mussolini.      The latter had welcomed the ideaand had said that the dates proposed were suitable.The Prime Minister said that, while he andthe Foreign Secretary were considering how the visit should be announced, some enterprisingnewspaper had got hold of the news and publishedit.      It had therefore been necessary to get into touch forthwith with the Italian Authorities andto ask if they would agree to an immediate announcement,      They had done so.The Prime Minister added that he and theForeign Secretary had been very much embarrased by this premature publication of the news.     The
-n-Prime Minister thought that the visit was likely tcprove of value.      It would be of advantage toestablish personal contact with Signor Mussolini,and they huped that in future they might be able t..speak with somewhat more confidence as to the actionwhich Italy v/as likely to take in given circumstances.THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGN AFFAIRS&amp;^/o- T said thatjthe forthcoming visit had already had oneo^6ui, ^aJtJo^s- 1 result.     Germany and Japan had been anxious tcproceed further with the elaboration of the Anti-(/- 6*Jez-o ^cyocO liefComintern Pact, but Italy had stood firm and indicated that she wished the matter postponed fcr a year.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE said thatthe Anglo-Italian Clearing was in a very unsatisfactoryposition, and that jn commercial grounds it wasnecessary to reduce our exports to Italy.     He had mentioned the matter some time ago to the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs, who had agreed thatthis course should be taken.     He wondered, however,whether in present circumstances the Foreign secretary might not wish the matter to be reconsidered.The Cabinet -(1)   Took note of the statement made by thePrime Minister regarding the proposed visit of himself and the foreign secretary to Signor Mussolini,(2)   Agreed that the President of the 3oarcJ.of Trade and the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs should consider further what action should be taken inregard to the Anglo-Italian Clearing,having regard to the forthcomingdiscup-sions in Rome.
PROPOSED VISITOP DR. SCHACHTTO THIS COUNTRY.8. THE PRIME MINISTER said that he would liketo take an opportunity of informing his colleagues of the position in regard to a matter which hadbeen the subject of an obscure paragraph in the daily Telegraph that morning.      He referred to theproposed visit of Dr. Schacht to this country.The Prime Minister said that there had beenrumours in Berlin that Dr. Schacht was before longcoming here possibly to discuss the Jewish question.Dr. Schacht had now written to the Governor of theBank of England and said that he was very anxious to visit this country and that he had obtained field marshal Goering&apos;s approval.     He strongly desiredto see the Governor personally and also, it wasgathered, a number of Ministers.      He did notspecify the subjects which he wished to discussbeyond stating that they would be economic andfinancial and that they might extend to a wider field;    and that he would bring with him a solutionof the Jewish question.     This no doubt referredto some proposal to allow the Jews to take their property out of Germany.The Prime Minister said that it seemed clearthat there was a difference of opinion between theModerates and Extremists in Germany and he thought we should do all we could to encourage the Moderates.We might also obtain some useful information as toGermany&apos;s economic position which was giving hercause for great anxiety.     After consulting withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs he had authorised theGovernor to tell Dr. Schacht that he would be gladIS-
if he would visit this country.The Prime Minister added that no doubt he or some of his colleagues should see Dr. Schachtand that they v/ould endeavour to do so withoutpublicity.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE DUCHY OP LANCASTER said he thought Dr. Schacht would be willing to see the assistant Director of the Inter-governmental committee on Refugees.     He agreed that publicity should be avoided.The Cabinet took note of thePrime Minister&apos;s statement.
pHA. 9.      The Cabinet had under consideration thesistanoe to.   folowing Most Secret documents on the subject sfrevious Assistance to China:-ference:binet 32 (a) A Memorandum by ^e Seci^etary of State8). Con- for Foreign Affairs (CP.-266 (38))usioii 8.) relating to an urgent request by His.    \ Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in China: that,$^C3&apos; in view of statements made to him byChiang-Kai-Shekj, the Cabinet&apos;s decisionto rule rut any form of loan to China should be re-examined.     The foreign secretary proposed that legislation should be introduced to guarantee a contribution of  3 millions to theChinese currency stabilisati-n fund,on certain conditions:(b) A note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer(CP.-268 (38)) commenting on the Secretaryof State&apos;s proposals, pointing out thefinancial risk involved in trying tosupport the Chinese currency at this time.The Chancellor also suggested that any new loan would,, in effect6 be used formilitary   purposess and that we must therefore face the question whetherdeparture from a policy of non-intervention would not expose us to risks which we werenot in a position to deal with.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that the situation was clearly very grave.He invited his colleagues to study the telegrams from Sir A. Clark Kerr appended to memorandum cp. 266 (38) 0The Foreign Secretary said he thought therewere three questions to be answeredo     The first was whether the modest help now proposed would beof any benefit to Chinao     On this he pointed outthat the amount of the loan proposed ( 3 million)was the amount officially asked for by the Chinese
Embassy, although it v/as true that we had beeninformed unofficially that if v/e were prepared to lend a larger sum this would be even more helpful.The Foreign Secretary thought that the granting ofthe loan proposed would constitute a definite act of friendship and encouragement.     It would help tohold the position, and to prevent China fallingunder the domination of either Russia or Japan.The second question was whether the proposedlean would involve us in risk of war with Japan.The Foreign Office thought it&apos; would not have this result.     Japan constantly said that the maintenanceof the Chinese currency was in the interests ofJapan0     We could defend the action taken as beingtaken in defence of our own interests.     Further,the extent of the help was so small that it was unlikely that Japan would react strongly against it.He agreed, however, that the telegrams fromSir Robert Craigie dealing with Japan&apos;s probable attitude if we gave help to China (see telegrams1396 and 140S from Tokio) -was- not altogether clear.He thought, however, that when Sir Robert said that&quot;action by Great Britain alone would involve us in serious risk&quot; he was thinking in terms of Britishreprisals against Japan, rather than a currencyloan.The third question was where the UnitedStates stood in this matter.     Some time ago the
United States had asked whether we w*.uld consideraction hy way of retaliation,,     This matter was still under consideration.The Foreign Secretary added that yesterdayhe had seen Colonel Murray who had recentlyreturned from staying with President Roosevelt.He put the currency proposal to Colonel Murray whohad not by any means ruled it out as impossible.The proposed currency loan v/as almost the onlyconcrete action which v/e could take t&quot; help China.Certain action in regard to the road in burma to the Chinese Frontier was going ahead;   butthe Export Credits Guarantee Department had turneddown the proposal to guarantee credits for theexport of lorries and nothing was likely to come ofthe proposed railway for two or three years.The Foreign Secretary summed up his argumentby saying that on balance he was in favcur of ourmaking the proposed loan.     If, however, hiscolleagues thought that this was going too far hesuggested that he should be authorised to approach the United States Government and ascertain whetherthey would join with us in making the loan.
THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER referred to the telegrams from Sir Robert Craigie quoted above, and expressed some doubt whether they bore the interpretationput on them by the Foreign Secretary,,THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that he had discussed this matter with the Second Sea Lord, who had recently returned from China and had expressed the viewthat if we took action on the lines proposed alone, japan would retaliate against use the PRIME MINISTER said that although at the outsethe had thought that we should accept the proposal he had come to the conclusion that the risks were too great andthat we should not take this action alone0   He had recently had a conversation with the new Japanese Amabssador, whichhad created a very disagreeable impression on his mind.The Ambassador had said that we in this country must recognise the attitude of the Japanese nation to us in theFar East.   This was, that they were anxious to be on goodterms with us, but that they saw us helping their enemies.The Prime Minister said that he had at onceasked the Ambassador what he meant by this, and the ambassador had replied that he referred to political help.He feared, however, that even if we made only a smallloan to China for currency purposes, the Japanese would saythat we v/ere definitely helping their enemies.    If we took this action he thought that Japan might retaliatein some intolerable way in regard to our interests inChina, or might make some threat which we could notignore.   We should then have to face the question whether we were prepared to go to war with Japan0   At the presentmoment he felt that the position in Europe was notsufficientljr stable to justify us in incurring this risk.
The Prime Minister also referred to the views expressed by the Chief of Naval Staff and the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff at the Meeting of the Chiefs ofStaff held on the 23rd November.,   The conclusion of theChiefs of Staff had been that there were no strongmilitary arguments which necessitated any representationsbeing made by .the Chiefs of Staff to the Cabinet infavour of a loan &quot;being granted to the Chinese at thepresent time.The Prime Minister thought that at the present stage the right course v/as first  bo clear up thedoubtful points in regard to Sir Robert Craigie&apos;s viev/s;secondly, to consult with the United States government as to their attitude0   He suggested that we should indioateto that Government that we were seriously considering thematter, and that our inclination to go forward with theproposal for a loan would be much strengthened if we hadan assurance that the United States Government wereprepared to join with us in making the loancTHE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said that hethought the proposal that the money should he lentfor currency purposes was little more than a facade,and that any money lent would in effect go intoChina&apos;s war chest.   Further, the fact that money wasbeing lent by the British Government to China would be exploited by the latter0The Chancellor said that his immediate concernwas that the language used in any approach to theUnited States Government slKmld not convey theimpression that we had reached the concrusion thatwe ought to take action on the lines proposed.   Hethought that the approach should be entirely neutral,
THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE said thathe thought there might be an alternative coursebetween acceptance and rejection of the proposal tcask Parliament to pass special legislation toauthorise a loan of  3 millions to China fir currencypurposes.     He was somewhat apprehensive as to thepresent position of the Export Credits guarantee department.      So far as concerned transactions whichcould be justified on commercial grounds, the present arrangements worked satisfactorily-      When, however,one entered the sphere of power-politics and came to examine schemes which were desirable on broadpolitical grounds, but could not be justified solely on commercial grounds,  there was more difficulty..He was proposing to discuss with the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer the extension of the Export credits guarantee system to cover such cases,      If a scheme could be v/worked out on these lines, and the necessarylegislative authority obtained,; he thought it;might be possible to assist the Chinese government under the powers so conferred.      It was true that thescheme he had in mind would only cover credits for goods, but means might perhaps be found of ensuring that money made available in this .way could be usedfor currency purposes.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR INDIA AND 3URMAsaid that he was in favour of the Foreign Secretary&apos;original proposal, or, if that could not be adopted,of a scheme rn the lines proposed by the Presidentof the Board of Trader.      It was a vital interest toIndia and Burma to have a friendly and, so far as
possible, stable country on their north-east frontiers.He had recently been pressing the Burmese Governmentto improve road facilities towards the Chinesefrontier, and that Government had asked what action we were taking to assist China,      He would welcomeany action which we could now take to help China.THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGN AFFAIRS,referring to the President of the Board of Trade&apos;suggestion, said that Marshal Chiang Kai-shek wasto meet the Kuomintang on the 7th December, and, ifwe were to take any action to help China, it was desirable to announce the decision before that date.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE said thathe had little doubt that the firm which had beenasked to supply the lorries to China would take immediate action if we were in a position to inform them that we proposed to introduce legislation into parliament,  and that if that legislation was passedwe would be prepared, under the powers conferredthereunder, to guarantee a credit in respect of the transaction.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that hewould be happy to discuss with the President of theBoard of Trade his proposal for an extension of theExport Credits Guarantee schemes     He felt bound topoint out, however, that it would be somewhatdifficult to invite Parliament to approve a proposal that the Board of Trade should be authorised to givecredits up to a sum of say  10 millions or  15millions in respect of transactions which could not beaccepted under the Export Credits Guarantee scheme as
commercially sound.     Public opinion would be anxiousto know what countries were to benefit under these powers.      It would be difficult to find any argument which afforded adequate justification for the v/idepowers proposed, and which at the same time could beused publicly.The Cabinet agreed  (1)    That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should be authorised to approach the United States Government in regard tothe proposal that a sum of  3 millions should be guaranteed to the Hong-kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation to assistthe Chinese currency;(2)   That the line to be tcken in approaching the United States Government should bethat His Majesty&apos;s Government have reachedno conclusion in regard to this proposal,but that they would give it more favourable consideration if they knew that the UnitedStates Government would be prepared to join with them in the action proposed:(3)   That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should take steps to obtain fromSir Robert Craigie a more definite statement as to the probable reaction of the JapaneseGovernment if this Country were to make a guaranteed loan to assist the Chinese currency,either above or in conjunction with theUnited States Government:That the Chancellor of the Exchequer andthe President of the Board of trade should consult together in regard to thePresident&apos;s proposal for an extension ofthe Export Credits Guarantee scheme;(5)   That pending the result of these enquiries,a decision should be postponed in regardto the proposals set out in the Memorandumby the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs (CoP.-266 (38))o
ABYSSINIANFRONTIERS .(previous reference:Cabinet 24(38), Con-elusion 2.)10.       The Cabinet had before them a Most SecretJoint Memorandum by the Secretaries of State forForeign Affairs and the Colonies ( CP,-267 (38))pointing out that the coding into fo^ce of theAnglo-Italian Agreement would necessitate the openirgof negotiations with the Italian Government for the delimitation of the frontiers between Italian Ea*tAfrica on the one hand, and the Sudan, Kenya andBritish Somaliland on the other.   Authority wassought to ask the Italian Government to agree tocertain territorial readjustments on the frontiers of italian East Africa, on the lines indicated in theMemorandum.   So far as concerned the Sudan frontierit would be necessary &quot;^or the Egyptian Government tobe associated with these negotiations, and steps were^eing taken to obtain the concurrence of the egyptian government to the proposals outlined.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES saidthat this matter had been examined by the ColonialOffice, Foreign Office? the Treasury and the -three service Departments.     The present boundaries were extremely unsatisfactory, and he was anxious toproceed with a scheme which had been envisaged sometime back for a re-delimitation of the frontiers.In some places the existing boundaries cut acrosstribal boundaries.      In other cases the tribes hadto cross existing boundaries at certain seasons inorder to reach the watering places8.The proposals fell into three sections: thefirst concerned the Sudan boundary., The proposals under this head would involve the transfer to
Italian sovereignty of a certain number of british protected persons,, but he understood that the ForeignOffice raised no objectionsto the course proposed.The second section concerned the Kenya frontier,in regard to which he had no observations.The third section concerned the Somalilandfrontier.     It would be seen that it was proposed inthe last resort, in order to obtain the concessionsfor which we asked, that we should be prepared to cedean area at present in Kenya marked 1fD&quot; on Map &quot;B&quot;.This would involve the transfer to Italy of 5,000British subjects, and raised obvious politicaldiff icultieso     He thought^ that this point should be reserved, and that if the negotiators reached a point at which they were unable to obtain our requirementswithout making this concession^ the matter should bereferred back to the Cabinet.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was ratheruneasy about certain aspects of his proposals andhe suggested that they should be examined by the ForeignPolicy Committee.      The proposals contemplated fairlyextensive exchanges of territory.     His colleagues would recollect the agitation which had taken placequite recently, when it had been thought that proposals were under consideration whereby certaintracts of territory, or peoples,- should in effect be handed over like chattels to a totalitarian State.Even if it could fairly be said that the numbers hereconcerned were very small,, that did not altogetherdispose of ..hc difficulty.
Further, as he had informed his colleagues that morning, he was proposing to visit signor mussolini in January.     If negotiations were nowopened in regard to these frontiers, was it not likely that Signor Mussolini would say, during the rome discussions, that we were asking for bigconcessions?     Might not they in return bring pressure to bear on us for counter concessions at an awkwardmoment?The -^rime Minister also referred to the strategic aspects of the proposals.     Thus therewas a suggestion that the Italians should be given a grant of territory which would enable them toestablish a seaplane base on Lake Rudolf,     There were also certain proposals that roads should be developed to facilitate Italian traffic.      These roadsmight,however,  in certain circumstances, be used tofacilitate the entry of hostile forces.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR welcomed thePrime Minister&apos;s proposal.     He said that there were a number of weighty objections to the present proposals from the military point of view.     be referred in particular to the proposal to allow theItalians transit facilities through the Sudan.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff thought thatthe Italians would follow this up by asking forItalian representation in the Sudan, which in his view should be resisted at all costs.
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that theAir Staff saw serious objections to some of the present proposals.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER,speaking from personal knowledge, hoped that the Barosalient in the Sudan, which was a continual menaceand had resulted in the loss of the lives of british soldiers would be straightened out.After further discussion THE CABINET agreed:-(1)  That the joint Memorandum by the secretaries of State for ForeignAffairs and the Colonies (CP.  267(38))should be referred in the first instance to the Chiefs of Staff, and should thenbe considered by the Foreign PolicyCommittee in the light of the Chiefsof Staff review.(2) That the Secretary of State for theColonies should be authorised tonegotiate for a continuance ofthe existing Grazing Rights and transit Traffic Agreements whichlapse in february,  19390
NATIONALSERVICEREGTSTR --7 TON.(previous reference:Cabinet 51(38), Con-elusion 1.)12. The Cabinet had under consideration thefollowing documents on the subject of NationalService Registrytion:-(a) A Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal(CP ,-262 (38)), at the end of whichhe summarised his suggestions 8.sfollows:-(l) That all the practical requirementsof the present, situation can be fully met by the plans outlined inhis Memorandum, which contemplate -(a) The issue o^ a suitable handbookfor the guidance of would-bevolunt eors &apos;,(b) A general appeal for volunteers?( c) The local compilation of registers of volunteers under an orgahisa-tion to be set up ad hoc by theMinistry o^ Labour&apos;,(2) that. preparations should at once bemade to admit of th* immediatecompilation of a complete nationalregister in case of emergency:(3) That extended provision be made for good  citizenship training,(b) An Extract from the Conclusions of the33rd. Meeting of the Foreign PolicyCommittee (CP.-264 (38) ), at which theabove proposals had been discussed.( c) The draft o^ a statement to be made in theHouse of Commons on Thursday, 1st December,regarding the Government&apos;s proposals (CP.-263 (38)), furnished by the Lord privy seal in accordance v.-ith Conclusion (2)of the above-mentioned Extract from the33rd Meeting of the Foreign PolicyCommittee.
THE PRIME MINISTER explained the reasons why thismatter had been considered by the Foreign PolicyCommittee.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that he had circulatedtwo Paperso    One (CP.-262 (38)) argued the case infavour of his proposals, while the other (CP.-263(38)) was intended to form the basis of a statement to bemade in the House of Commons0The Lord Privy Seal explained that the variousVoluntary Registers which he proposed should be setup would fall short of a complete National Register,the compilation of which would involve compulsion,.   Atthe same time he proposed that we should put ourselves inthe position in which a complete National Register could,if desired, be compiled in a very short time,    In a year&apos;s time the Registrar General would normally start the preparations for the 1941 Census, and he could quiteconveniently begin to enroll enumerators and supervisorystaff forthwith.    The only additional expense involved would be the cost of the printing of forms required forthe National Register, amounting to some  7,000.    Ifthese steps were taken it would be possible to completea National Register in about three weeks&apos; time as againstthree months, which would otherwise be required.The Lord Privy Seal outlined the reasons why a compulsory National Register was necessary in war butnot in peace.   First, that a compulsory National Registerconstituted the best basis for a rationing system.Secondly, that it was necessary to make sure that therehad been a satisfactory response to calling up persons of a given age and occupation.   Thirdly, that it provided the statistical material necessary to decide the best use to be made of man-power in a long conflict.
The argument against making a National Registernov/ was that experience shov/ed that no Register could &quot;bekept effectively up to date by the process of continuousrevision.   He cited examples in other spheres, whichshov/ed that every Register would have to be revisedabinitio at intervals0Turning to the Handbook, the Lord Privy Sealexplained that this was intended to help people in deciding how they could best help the State.    This wouldbe accompanied by the Schedule of Reserved or ProtectedOccupations.    In conjunction with the Minister of Labourhe proposed to establish a National Service organisationand Committees all over the country.   He hoped that itwoxild be possible to issue the necessary documents and toset the organisation going by the third week in January.In the meantime the Lord Privy Seal said that he proposed to examine carefully the training organisation,since it would be useless to start a big recruitingeffort for Civil Defence until the training arrangements had been brought up to standard.   In this matter he was largely dependent upon the Local Authorities, but he had recently increased the out-door staff of the Air RaidPrecautions Department and hoped to achieve a successfulco-ordinated recruiting effort withoxit superseding theexisting machinery.The Lord Privy Seal gave instances to show thatin certain areas, e.g. Birmingham, the number of recruitswas in excess of those immediately required for civil defence, but a considerable number of those who hadvolunteered could not be provided with adequate training.In some areas there was a considerable shortage;   buton the whole thanks t o the efforts of the HomeSecretary the position in regard to recruiting for1
.      3 I $civil defence was favourable, except in regard to the fire brigades, where only 61,000 persons had been obtained outof the 300,000 called for.Generally, in the sphere of civil defence he did not intend to rest content with recruiting the numbers whichwould be immediately required on the outbreak of war.      he proposed to earmark a reserve for each of the Services.     Atthe moment the estimate of the numbers required for the reserves was necessarily conjectural.      If the number ofpersons who volunteered was considerably in excess of thereserve estimated to be required for each Service he proposedto form an unallocated reserve.      The personnel under this head would be under the control of the Ministry of Labour.There would also be separate registers of persons withexceptional professional or technical qualifications-The Lord Privy Seal said that it must not be thoughtthat registers compiled on these bases, supported by the lists of protected occupations, would be any less valuablebecause they were kept as separate registers, and in differentlocalities.      Indeed, he thought that registers in this formwere in fact best suited to the needs of the situation.Continuing, the Lord Privy Seal said that   he proposedto institute general training in civil defence,  starting onmodest lines and increasing in scope, if necessary.     He hopedthat this training would go some way to meet the widespreaddemand for national service which had manifested itself in the crisis.      It must be borne in mind that it would not bepossible to find occupation in the various defence services for all the people who might wish to volunteer.The form of the Handbook had not yet been finally settled, but it would be necessary to go to print before long.
a l &apos;lSome discussion ensued as to the form of thehandbook.      Was it desirable that in the handbook,the Civil Defence Services should appear before theDefence Services?THE LORD PRIVY SEAL explained that the firstproof had placed all the Service;-   in the order of strict seniority.      He had thought, however, thatthe book would be much more useful to the type of person for whom it v/as primarily intended if it tookits present formcIn regard to paragraph 4 of the draft statement to be made in the House of Commons, theLord Privy Seal considered that if the handbook, asfinally approved, v/as on the lines of the latestdraft it should bo sent to every households      the rev/as great difficulty in adopting any other course.It would be difficult to decide v/hich householdsshould be furnished with copies and v/hich should not?and it would also be necessary to hold large numbersof copies in reserve in central places,      lie,therefore, favoured the adoption of paragraph 4rather than of the alternative 4(A).      This, however.,did not exclude the use of leaflets,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said that hethought the handbook should be carefully examined bythe Cabinet, particularly with reference to theposition given in it to the Fighting Services.      these services were first referred to on page 3 of theintroduction, where they were placed after the police force and the Fire Brigades,      This was contrary to thenormal practice, v/hich v/as to give priority to theduty of enlisting in the Fighting Services.,
Again, when the details of particular services were given Air Raid Precautions was given prideof place.The Secretary of State for War alsocommented on certain revisions in regard toages, and said that the ages for various air raid Precautions Services had been drasticallyreduced without consultation with the defence departments.     He explained that the annual intake of the Territorial Army was in the neighbourhoodof 50,000 and approximately &quot;the  same number eachyear was required for the Regular Army.     Theposition of these Services must be maintained atall costs.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that he would,ofcourse, be happy to discuss all these points withthe Ministers concerned.     He understood that inall cases where it was proposed to alter ages of entry the matter was already the subject of departmental correspondence.     Certain reducedages which had not been agreed had, however, been inserted in the present proof, without,of course,in any way prejudging discussion with theDepartments concerned.      It was- clear that all suchmatters would have to be settled by agreementbetween the Ministers concerned.It was pointed out that the essentialmatter was to reach agreement as to the statement to be made by the Lord Privy Seal on the ensuingday.      In this connection the SECRETARY OP STATEFOR SCOTLAND expressed the hope that the statement that the compilation of the National Register wouldbe postponed until the emergency would not be made-34-
**3 5-*in too definite terms, since he felt that this wasa matter which might have to he reviewed/ed at alater date-THE MINISTER OP HEALTH suggested the deletion of lines 7 and 8 (all except the last tv/owords) on page 6 of CP.  263 (38).This course was agreed to.The Cabinet agreed:-(1)   To approve the draft statement on National Voluntary service to be made by the Lord privy seal on 1st December (CP. 263(38) Revise), subject to thenecessary drafting amendments.(2)    That Ministers should send any drafting amendments forthwith to the Lord Privy Seal, andshould indicate whether they wished to be consulted if theiramendments could not be aaceptedwithout modification(3)    That the Minister for Co-ordinationof Defence should convene ameeting of the Lord Privy Sealand the three Service ministers to consider:-(a) the age limits for thevarious forms of NationalService comprised in theHandbook of NationalService .(b) questions affecting the priority of Services inthe Handbook.(4)    Subject to the above, to approvegenerally the proposals madeby the Lord Privy Seal in regardto National Service in CP.262 (38).
NAVAL 13.    In pureuance of the Conclusion mentioned inBRIGADES.the margin, the Cabinet had. before, them a Memorandum(Previous       by the Minister -for Co-ordination of Defence (C.P.-Reference:Cabinet 35   265 (38))  circulating the following Conclusions of(38),  Con-olueion 9.) the Committee of Imperial Defence at their 339thMeeting (Minute 1):-&quot;(a) To recommend to the Cabinet the approvalof the propose-1 formation of NavalBrigades as outlined in the Memorandumby the former First Lord of the Admiralty(CP.-183 (38)):(b) That the Admiral+y should, confer with theMinis try of Labour at once on the questionof making reference to the Naval Brigadesin the National Service Handbook.&quot;After a short discussion, the cabinet approved the proposed formation of Naval Brigadesas outlined in the memorandum by the First Lord ofthe Admiralty (CP, 183 (38)) on the tuiderstanding -(l)   That the financial arrangements would be discussed with theTreasury;(2)   That the War Office would be consulted before it was decidedto raise a Naval Brigade in anyparticular area in order to avoidclashing with recruiting for anti-aircraft units of theTerritorial Army.
WESTMINSTER&apos;HOUSE SIT&quot;1?.I( previous reference:Cabinet 44(35), Con-elusion 5 t)14.     ^Tie Cabinet had &quot;before them a Memorandum bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer f CP.-270 (38))referring to a Motion on tlv3 Order Paper       the Houseof Commons urging the Government to play their part,in conjunction with the London County Council, theMiddlesex County Council and the Westminster city council,  in acquiring the Westminster House site(adjoining the Canning Enclosure)  in order to preservefor all time a. dignified, approach to Westminster Abbey,the Houses of Parliament and Whitehall.   At the meeting mentioned in the nargin the Cabinet had. agreed thatthe proposed improvement of the amenities of parliament square was not one of sufficient importance from anational point of view to  justify a departure from theordinary practice that the cost of improvement toCities should he paid for by local authorities .Bearing in mind recent events and their effect on national expenditure, the Chancellor of the Exchequerfelt that there was no option but to make an announce-ment of a final character removing any hope of financialassistance from the Exchequer over and. above any grantwhich woulfl be payable in the ordinary way from theRoad Fund in the event of the scheme going through.In the course of discussion it was pointedout that the Middlesex County Council, who had boughtthe site at a price considerably in excess of thereal value and who were the party who stood to gainmost if the area in question were added to the open space of Parliament Square, were only proposing tocontribute  50,000 towards the total cost.    Again,  itwas difficult to justify a contribution from theExchequer to this scheme, over and above the Road Fund
contribution, having regard to the effect of the events of the last few months on national expenditure.On the other hand, the proposal was strongly pressed by the amenity groups.    Two hundred and fortyMembers of Parliament had now put their names to a motion to the effect that it would be a nationalcalamity if a commercial building were erected on the westminster House site.    It v/as also argued that alarge commercial building on the site mightconsiderably damage the amenities of parliament square, and that the ordinary rule that the costof the improvement of cities should be paid by theLocal Authorities was perhaps not wholly applicablein the present case.After further discussion, the Cabinet agreedThat the Chancellor of the exchequer should be authorised to state thatthe Government were prepared to makea total contribution of  100,000 (thesum   &quot;Sc include any grant payable fromthe Rc;;.d Fund) towards the acquisitionof the Westminster House site, if theLocal Authorities concerned are willingto increase   their contributions to an extent sufficient to enable the westminster House site to be added tothe open space of Parliament Square.
3?^t, w &quot;MILK industry bill.((previous reference:Cabinet 54 (38)Conclusion 12)F:R.3l($q) )u-.15.     THE PRIME MINISTER said that theopposition to this Bill had spread and grown in intensity.     He had been in consultation with theMinister of Agriculture and Fisheries as to theaction v/hich should be taken, and until recentlythey had thought that it would suffice to say onthe Second Reading that they would approach theCommittee Stage v/ith an open mind.     He had had itin mind that they should agree to the withdrawal        &apos;of the rationalisation scheme at the committee stage.That had been the position up to theprevious day when, together with the Ministerof Agriculture and Fisheries and the Chief Whip,he had received a Deputation from the Chairman ofthe House of Commons Agricultural Committee   andthe Chairman of the 1922 Committee.     The reports which he had received from these two gentlemen made it clear to him that it would not suffice to dealwith the matter on the lines previously proposed.The opposition to this Bill was now impervious toargument, and there was a definite prejudice againstthe Bill.     He had reached the conclusion that thebest plan would be to make an announcement that thefurther progress of the Bill would be postponed tillafter Christmas, in order to allow opportunity forfurther discussion to take place with the interests concerned, in view of the opposition which had beenmanifested.The Prime Minister said that an announcement on these lines did in fact mean that the Bill in itspresent form v/as dead.     On the other hand, the critics on the Government side of the House were-39-
anxious to avoid embarrassing the Government, and he was sure that the present difficulty was a passing one andwould soon be removed.     He v/as sure that his colleagues would all sympathise with the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries in the position which had arisen.     he proposed that the announcement which he had suggested should be made on Thursday, when the business for the ensuing week was announced.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said thatthe Scottish Farmers&apos; Union and the Scottish Milk board had informed him that,while they hoped that the bill might be modified in certain details, they would be disappointed if it were abandoned.      It v/as evident that public feeling in Scotland viewed the Bill more favourably than in England.The Cabinet agreed:That an announcement should be made asto the postponement of further progressof the Milk Bill until after the christmas Recess on the lines proposed.
16,   The Cabinet had under- consideration.a. Memo-randum by the T/inister of Health and the Secretaryof State for Scotland (H..A.-37 (38)), covering thedraft Cancer Bill, the principal objects of whichwere to make further provision ^or the treatmentof cancer, to authorise the Minister of Health to lend money to the National Radium Trust and to prohibit certain advertisements relating to cancer:together with the following recommendation thereon by the Committee of Home Affairs (.H&apos;.A.G. 18th Con-elusions (38), T/inu+e 1)&quot;To authorise the introduction forthwith in the House of Commons of the CancerBill in the form of the draft annexed to H..A.-37 (38), subject to the inc^r-poration in Clause 3 (l) of the amend-ment adopted by the Committee, andsubject &quot;lso to any drafting or other minor alterations th*t may be foundnecessary or desirable,&quot;THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that the HomeAffairs Committee were anxious that this Billshould receive early approval.     Subject to theCabinet&apos;s views, it was intended that it should beintroduced, read a first time and published that day.THE MINISTER OP HEALTH said that the lord president of the Council had raised with him thequestion whether provision for research should beincluded in the Bill.     The m&amp;tter had beendiscussed by the Home Affairs Committee who had reached the conclusion that the Bill should beintroduced in its present form, without theinclusion of any provision for research.     this conclusion had been reached on the following grounds:first, that the Government provision for researchtook the form of a direct subvention to the Medical-41-
Research Council which, if it were thought right, couldbe increased without any need for legislation;secondly, that it would be anomalous to provide in-the Ministry of Health Bill for money which would befound from the Vote of the Privy Council Office.     Thequestion of making additional provision for researchwas, however, being investigated^The Cabinet approved the recommendationof the Committee of Home Affairs as setforth above.
