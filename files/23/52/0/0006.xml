CABIN-ST 6 (26)..3.A*    The Cabinet had before thorn a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in regardto the claim of Poland and other Powers to becomePermanent Members of the Council of the League ofNations on the occasion of Germany&apos;a entry into theI League and inclusion among tho Permanent Members ofthe Council (Paper C-40(26i ).      In addition,despatches from Sir aus ten Chamberlain to the Marquessof Ore&apos;..o (dated February 16,  19 26) ana to Lord L&apos; Abernon(dated February lb,  1926 J in regard to German roprosen-tat ions on the subject,  were handed round during theMeeting.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, while recognising that public  opinion in this country was atpresent  opposed  to the addition to the Council of theLeague of any State other than Germany,  laid before his colleagues the reasons for and against both anincrease in the size of the Council and the claims of particular nation;&apos; to receive  permanent membership of the Council.In regard  to the general question of the size of the Council,  he dwelt on the great importance of strengthening the moral authority of the League tothe point that,  by building up,  as it were, a systemof international jurisprudence,  the Council might eventually achieve in disputes between great nations the same success as it had already gained  in avertingwars between minor States, as in the recent Greco-Bulgarian dispute.      he pointed  out that the partiesto a dispute,  even if they are Members of the Council,to not vote on their own case.      Consequently,  in theevent  of a dispute arising,  for example,  out of a violation of the Locarno Treaties,  e.g.  Treaty of locarno Article 2(4) and Article 6(3),  a large
proportion of the existing Members of the League wouldbe unable to take part and some vitally important issue would be  left in the hands of the representatives of twoor three relatively minor State;? whoso decision could not carry sufficient weight with the disputants.      This was an argxmient for increasing the size of the Council.A3 regards the claims of particular States,  sir austen Chamberlain pointed out that  (as the cabinet were informed  on November 11,  l(J2b -- Cabinet bg( 2b)Conclusion o)  we were already committed to support theclaims of Spain, who,   if no longer one of the great powers, noverthelessastands out from .among the smallerStates and possesses historical arid cultural claims toa seat on the Council ana who,  unless  elected to apermanent  seat, must in the normal course presentlymake way for some leas important Power.The case of Poland rested on the ground that herinclusion might tend towards strengthening the prospects of peace in Europe.      It was certain that,  in -the notdistant future,  difficult   questions would arise in regardto the  points of contact between Germany and Poland:e.g.,   in Lanaig and  the  &quot;corridor&quot;,  Upper Silesia,   etc.In considerihg these matters Poland would be placed ata disadvantage if Germany was a member of the Counciland  she was not.      The success of the Council had beenfound  in practice to depend to a considerable extent on the establishment between its members of a relation-ship comparable with that  of Cabinet colleagues.      Inthese e ireumstanees a nation outside the Council (as hadbeen felt in the case of the Mosul dispute)  was almost inevitably at some disadvantage in a dispute with aMember of the Council whose representative was,  inrespect of other matters before the Council,  workingiii close and cordial co-operation with his colleagues.
Agreement in regard to disputes between Poland and Germany     .$would almost certainly be easier to secure if &quot;both partiesapproached the question on equal terms,  and more particularly if a better spirit had been engendered between the twocountries by collaboration in the other work of the Councilin which no opposition of interests^existed between themand by the spirit of fellowship and conciliation whichgrows up among its members.      The same object Would not beachieved by temporary membership for Poland,  as &apos;such member-ship must lapse after a comparatively brief term of years,and the difficulties between the two countries were toofundamental to be disposed of within so short a period.as regards the claims of Brazil, which appeared to beweak, Sir Austen Chamberlain was inclined to put on thatcountry the onus of establishing that the South american states supported its claims.In the&apos; discussion which followed the Secretary ofState&apos;s remarks, a caveat was entered lest the effectiveness of the Council should be diminished by increasing its size.The Cabinet v.ere reminded that the principle on which thepermanent membership of the uouncil had originally been fixed at the Paris Peace Conference had been to includeonly Powers whose interests were no world-wide that theycould be regarded as concerned  in the settlement of everyserious international dispute;      Apart from the existingpermanent members - Great Britain, France,  Italy and Japan -it had always been hoped that the United States of America,Germany and Russia would eventually become permanent members and. it was in anticipation of this that two more non-permanent members were added.      Of those suggested&apos;as new permanent members Spain had a stronger claim than the others bothhistorically and because of her very wide cultural interests.it was pointed out that the Brazilian claim would cause resentment in Chile and in the Argentine Republic, &apos;v
mwhich was on the brink of a decision as to whether tore-join the League or not.Tfie grant of permanent membership, owing to theexistence of grounds of acute controversy with a state which was already a Member of the Council was criticised as providing a- dangerous precedent.It was pointed out that Poland had not in the past been a very good Member of the League and had floutedthe League in seizing and retaining Vilna.   Her election to permanent membership would cause resentment in some countries, particularly in Germany, Lithuania and Cecho-Slovakia.    Two alternatives were suggested:-(i) That the forthcoming Meeting of theAssembly should be confined to considering the claims of Germanyonly, leaving the claims of othercountries to be dealt with laterafter Germany had become a Memberof the Council.(This coursej however, had alreadybeen tried, without success.)(ii) To agree to the admission of Spain;as regards Brazil, to enter into an understanding that Members of theCouncil would use their influence ,to secure that either the ArgentineRepublic, Brazil or Chile should always be a temporary Member;    and,as regards Poland, to discourage her from applying for permanent membership,but for Members of the Council tosupport Polish claims for temporarymembership, and even for an extensionthereof on its termination.It was also suggested that the great success, ofthe policy of the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs had been due to the inclusion therein of Germany for thefirst time on terms of equality, and that support toPolish membership of the Council would tend to weaken the popularity of the policy both at home and in theDominions.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed the Cabinet that he had reason to know that the reportthat Spain would veto Germany&apos;s claim, to- become a
permanent member of the Council if the Spanish claims were not acceded, to had no authority,    sir austen chamberlain said that,  incConversation with the french ambassador, he had suggested that the friends of Polandmight, in view of the opposition to her claims, do well to advise her not to press for a permanent seat onthe Council but to concentrate on obtaining a temporaryseat.At this point the Cabinet adjourned their dis cussion,

7. The Cabinet had under consideration theattitude to be adopted towards the Town TenantsBill to be introduced by a Private Member on Fridaynext.The Cabinet agreed  That it was desirable, if possible,to avoid the discussion of the TownTenants Bill at the present stage,and at&apos;any rate that a division should be avoided.The Secretary for Scotlandindicated that the discussion&apos; of theBill referred to in the previousConclusion (The Allotments (Scotland)Bill) would probably occupy thegreater part of the sitting.
RE-ELECTIONOP MINISTERS(PreviousRsferenoe:Cabinet 4(26), Con-conclusion 2.,)8.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Home Secretary asking for a dacision as tothe attitude which the Government should take onthe amendment to the Re-election of Ministers(Private) Bill, propos ed by Sir John Simon^ thatthe Bill should not operate during the lifetime of the present Government (Paper C.P.-68   (.26)).For the reasons states in t3!&amp;a Home Secretary1!Memorandum, the Cabinet agreed  That the Home Secretary should be   -authorised to oppose SIX John Simon&apos;amendment.-8-

If sub-sectionsof the wire industry were considered, they couldnot be regarded as sufficiently Important to justify an Inquiry under that Procedure.On the advice of ths President of the Boardof Trade, the Cabinet agreed  That the President of the Board ofTrade should be authorised to reply that the decision of the Governmentin regard to the application of the steel&quot; Industry for an Inquiry underthe Safeguarding of Industries Pro-cedure would apply also to thesectional explications now undercons consideration.
