The Cabinet met to consider the draft of aBill to declare and arj&amp;snd the law with respect toillegal strikes, which had been prepared by-theCabinet Committee (Paper CP.-190 (26)),.    Copiesof the draft Bill were passed round at the outset of the meeting and collected immediately afterwardsGreat stress was Laid on the desirability of secrecy at the present stage, owing to the risk that the financial provisions of the Bill might be frustrated by premature disclosure.   The secretary was ins time ted to circulate no Minutes for a fewdays *The Attorney-General gave the Cabinet an explanation of the Bill.   Discussion centred inthe main on the question of whether the pronounce--ment as to the existence of an illegal strikeshould be determined by the Government, subjectto confirmation by Parliament, within a specified period, as in the case of the Emergency Powers Act,1920,  or by the Court, as implied in the draft bill the latter course was preferred.An additional clause was added to bring theAct into effect as from May 10, 1926.Several suggestions were made for adding to the Bill, but were not adopted, as it was felt to be desirable .to keep the Bill as short and assimple as possible, and therefore to confine it tothe main issue.The Cabinet were informed that a specialRegulation would require to be passed under theEmergency Proclamation to prevent the withdrawal by communists of foreign (e,g.Russian) money fromthe banks,
The Cabinet agreed -(a) To approve the Bill in the formgiven in the Appendix &apos;, Tor Intro-duction on Monday, May 10th, subjectto any drafting alterations thatmight be found necessary or desir-able, and subject to the circum-stances then existing:(b) That the Lord Chancellor, theSecretary of State for India andthe Attorney-General should draft a Regulation under the EmergencyProclamation to prevent the banksfrom paying out foreign money forpurposes prejxidicial to the public safety or life of the community:(c) That-the Lord President of theCouncil should ask the King to holda meeting of the Privy Council inorder to approve the above Regula-tion in time for it to become operative on the morning of Monday,May 10th.The Appendix is attached only to the standardcopy of the Minutes kept by the Secretary,but additional copies are available in theCabinet Office in the personal charge of theSecretary .
8. The chancellor of the Exchequer invited hiscolleagues, if questioned on the subject,  to makeit clear that there was not the smallest necessityor justification for any restraints on financialoperations, such as a closing of the Stock Exchangeor a moratorium, and that all suggestions of thekind were to be deprecated as calculated to createalarm and to depress credit.

I &apos; &apos;   . - ... 3618th May, 19 26.;   7 dear Samuel,HIt has occurred to me since our conversation this ^afternoon that in dealing with a matter so delicate it would beoetter to place upon record in writing the attitude of the.   government as 1 understand it.We have repeatedly stated that we cannot negotiateuntil the General Strike has been withdrawn.This statement has arery particular meaning.    Itnoans that until the necessary orders have been given towithdraw the Strike or unless, the Strike has come to an end,ve cannot as a condition or  inducement take part in negotiationsBin relation to the mining issue.    i?or if we did so,  there would send could be no uncondit ional withdrawal of . the Strike notices.On the contrary, the true situation sincerely faced would be thatIIwe had procured the end of the General Strike by a   process of.: bargaining.      The consent to do this would in fact fatally1disable the Government for a task which,  as trustees of thecommunity,  they conceive themselves bound to undertake.    Their$position is plain.    They hold, that the General Strike is^unconstitutional and illegal.    They are bound to take steps torake its repetition impossible.    It is therefore plain that theyI cannot enter upon any negotiations unless the Strike is sojtinreservedly concluded that there is not even an implication/of
In these circumstances, I am sure that the Governmentwill take the view that while they are bound mosfc carefullyand most sympathetically to consider the terms of any arrangement which a public man of your responsibility and experience may propose,  it is imperative to   make it. plain that any discussion which you think proper to initiateis not clothed in even a vestige of official character.in the light of recent events.The Rt.Hon.  Sir Herbert Samuel,  G.H.K.,of such a bargain upon their side as would embarrass themin any legislation which they may conceive to be proper
