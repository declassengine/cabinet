1. The Secretary of State for India gave theCabinet an account of the difficulties which had arisen in regard to the attitude of Mr Patel,  thePresident of the Indian Legislative Assembly^ whohad- used the very extensive powers conferred onhis office by the Government of India Act in a manner which threatened to- paralyse the presentsystem of government in India, and which might bring about a position in which the British Govern-ment would have no alternative but to amend theGovernment of India Act.    Lord Birkenhead statedthat he was in communication with the Viceroy onthe subject and intended to ask him for an appreciation of the situation which might result.   At themoment he asked for no decision.

The Committee had had te take certaindecisions on behalf of the Cabinet as,, for parliamentary reasons, the Bill had to be printedat once.    There had been only one controversialpoint, namely, ,as to the desirability of utilisingPost Office date-r-starrps as a medium for commercialadvertisements. &apos; The Committee had eventuallydecided that Clause 19, making provision forthis, should be included in the Economy Bill when -introduced, but that,if serious opposition should arise, the question of its retention should bereferred to the Cabinet for decision.The Cabinet approved the actionOf the Standing Committee on expenditure.
5..    The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed his colleagues that the Standing Committee on expenditure on the previous day had favoured a-proposal that the Prime Minister should appoint aCommittee to review expenditure on Police Services.The Home Secretary, the Minister of health and the Secretary for Scotland, while agreeing tothe principle of the Inquiry, pointed out thattheir respective Departments were concerned.The Cabinet agreed  That the Prime Minister should appoint a Committee to reviewexpenditure on Police Services.

In this MemorandumCabinet 48(25), Con- the President of theBoard of Trade expressed the elusion 26 .)view that, having regard to the finding of theCommittee that employment is not at present seriously affected, we should not be justified in proposing a duty in the forthcoming Budget;   but proposed that,in order to carry out the recommendation of theCommittee that the progress of the industry shouldbe carefully watched, the Board of Trade, with theassistance of the Department of Customs and Exciseand the Ministry of Labour, should closely watch theprogress of the Imports and unemployment.   He furtherproposed that the Report should be published.The Cabinet approved the course proposed by the President of theBoard of Trade, as set forth above, and left the time of publication of the Report tohis discretion.

the Minister of Labour setting forth the general lines of policy which,he proposed to work toat the forthcoming Conference in London on theInternational Regulation of Hours of Work, whichwere set forth In the following extract from his memorandum:-&quot;It seems  to me vital that any such agreement should, in the first place,impose no restrictive conditions thatwould In practice affect adverselythe competitive power of Britishindustry, and that it should, secondly,do something   however tentative  towards establishing a basis for raising the standard of working condi-tions as regards hours of labour among our competitors abroad. In particular,I regard it as essential to secureassent to the British view Ofc what are to be considered as hours of work,on the method of calculating hours for purposes of overtime, and on the requirement that an extra rate of notless than 25 per cent, is to be paid for overtime&quot; (Paper CP.-100 (26)).The Cabinet took note of the Ministerof Labour&apos;s Memorandum.
q. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Minister of Health covering the draftPublic Health (Smoke Abatement) Bill (Paper C.P.-87 (26)), and also a Memorandum by the Secretaryfor Scotland explanatory o^ the Scottisih provisionsof the Bill fPaper CP.-97 (26)), together withthe recommendations of the Committee of HomeAffairs thereon (H.A.C 5th Conclusions (26), Para.1).The Cabinet agreed  (a) To authorise the introduction inthe House of Lords of the PublicHealth (Smoke Abatement) Bill inthe forr- of the draft annexed to cp.-87 (26), subject to the omission of Clauses 5-8 and 14,and subject to any minor J*ltera-tions that may be found necessary or desirable:(b) That if, in the course of the debate, the Minister of Healthfound it necessary to strengthenClause 13   he should have authorityto substitute for Clause 13 analternative draft as proposed bythe Committee of Home Affairs,subject to prior concurrence inits&quot;terms by the Admiralty, WarOffice and Post Office:(c ) To take note that, whenever it isnecessary.to make corresponding provision for Scotland, the matterwill be. dealt with in a separate bill.
the Secretary for Sco-tland covering the draftCriminal Appeal ( Scotland.) Bill (Paper -CP.-64 (26))which has been prepared to give effect to. therecommendations of a-. Departmental Committee., appointed in 1925 by the Secretary for Scotland and confersrights of appeal in Scotland substantially similarto those enjoyed in England under the criminal appeal Act, 1907, together with the recommendationof the Committee of Home Affairs thereon (H.A.C.5th Conclusions (26), Para .2.The Cabinet .agreed  To authorise the introd\ic tion ofthe Criminal Appeal (Scotland)Bill in the form of the draft annexed to CP.-64 (26), subjectto any minor alterations which maybe found necessary or desirable.
11. The attention of the Cabinet was drawn,as a matter of urgency, to Questions which wereto be asked in the House of Commons on thefollowing day in regard to a speech of seditioustendencies delivered by Mr George Lansbury onthe previous Sunday.The Cabinet agreed -That, even though the speech mightbe a technical violation of the law,it was undesirable to gratify the speaker&apos;s wish for martyrdom,and that the Home Secretary shouldhave authority to reply to theQuestions in Parliament on theselines.
12.   The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to a Private Member&apos;s Bill, designated &quot;The Omni-buses Bill&quot;,to be introduced on the followingFriday.The Minister of Transport gave the cabinet a summary of the provisions of the Bill,    Underthe provisions of Clause 7 it was limited to LocalAuthorities who hai already been authorised toprovide,work or run tramways, trolley vehicleroutes or omnibuses, and its object was to enableLocal Authorities, under an authority from theMinister of Transport, to provide and maintainomnibuses:   that is to say, it placed LocalAuthorities (who had obtained the powers already referred to) on the same footing as private companies or individuals wishing to start anomnibus service.   A number of objections werepointed out to this Bill.The Cabinet agreed  That the Minister of transport should adopt a strictly non-committal attitu.de in regard tothe SScond Reading.-12-
13. The Cabinet were informed that Miss EllenWilkinson, a member of the Labour Party, would shortly introduce Mr Arthur Henderson&apos;s FactoryBill, which was likely to receive a. good deal of support in Parliament.    It was felt, however,that a Bill of this magnitude ought not to come up in the form of a Private Member&apos;s Bill, and itwas suggested that the Government might with advantage undertake to introduce their own FactoryBill, not with a view to attempting to pass it during the present Session, but in order to provide an opportunity for ascertaining public opinion and meeting criticisms before it was re-introduced in a later Session with a view to passage into law.The Cabinet agreed  That the Home Secretary should beauthorised to introduce theGovernment Factory Bill towardsthe end of the present parliamentary session;    that the provision inregard to. hours should stand over until after the international conference on the WashingtonHours Convention&apos;    and that this bill should be one of the principalGovernment measures for the next session of Parliament.
14.    in view of certain questions which wouldh&amp;ve to he dealt with by the Secretary of State forWar in the forthcoming Debate on the Army Esti-mates, the Cabinet approved, as a matter of urgency,the following Conclusion of the Cabinet Committeeon Rates of Pay in the Fighting Services&quot;Woolwich, Cadets. That the Cadets whoentered Woolwich in November, 1923,and who passed out at the end of lastterm, should be placed on the same footing as the Cadets who enteredSandhurst, i.e,, they should have their Commissions ante-dated by sixmonths and should be eligible^ forthe old rates of pay.    The committee consider that as the Woolwich Cadetspassed highest at the Entrance Exam-ination, it would be inequitable to treat them les3 favourably than theSandhurst Cadets.&quot;2, Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.1,  vMarch 10, 1928.*:PAY OP THEFIGHTING-SERVICES .(previous reference:Cabinet 4(26), Con-elusion 4.)
