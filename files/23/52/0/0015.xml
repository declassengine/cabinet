AFFAIRS.       1* The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsgernian       made a statement to the Cabinet in regard to negotia-W&apos; tions for Treaties between Germany and Russia, and &apos;.. Roumanianisn between Poland and RoumanianlionAs regards the Russo-German Treaty he recalled that the Russian Soviet Government had sought toyi.0118tn0Qon- prevent the Germans from taking part in the Locarnonegotiations and from going to Geneva, but without success.   Although the Germans had not been willingto yield to  the Russian wishes and threats,, theydid attach political importance to the maintenanceof some sort of relations with Russia..    In the last century it had been a cardinal feature of german policy to keep on good terms with Russia.    The ter-mination of their Reinsurance Treaty with russia by the late Emperor had led to the formation of the franco-Russian Treaty and other events culminatingin the war and the German defeat.   The view was heldin Nationalist circles in Germany that the termina-tion of the Reinsurance Treaty with Russia had beenthe point at which their foreign policy had taken awrong turning.    If the assurances given to LordDrAbernon by Dr. Stresemann were correct, the new treaty would not be one of alliance between Germanyand Russia but one guaranteeing German neutrality inthe event of an tinprovoked aggression against Russia.In Sir Austen Chamberlain&apos;s view the Treaty itself,as described by Dr.  Stresemann, would be innocuous,the real danger being its reactions on France and poland.    Germany had not in this case followed the genoa precedent in entering on die Treaty of Rapallowithout notice. In this case the Germans had informedGreat Britain and France of their intentions.
The new Polish-Roumanian Treaty differed fromthat of 1921 in that it is said to bind Roumania todefend Poland1s German frontier as well as herEastern frontier, the latter having been the limitedobligation in 1921.    The Treaty purported to be inconformity with the Locarno model, but it was likelyto arouse indignation in Germany and Russia.Until the excitement caused by these Treatieshad died down it was diffi-eult to make progress inthe working out of the Locarno policy.   For example,M. Briahd found it impossible at the present time toagree to the increase in the police force in the rhineland desired by Germany,   Sir Austen Chamberlainsaid that he had suggested to the French Governmentthat, provided the Convention was compatible withthe assurances given by Dr. Stresemann,  it would be inadvisable to raise opposition to its signature.
2. A^ the suggestion of the Secretary of Statefor Foreign. Affairs,, the Cabinet agreed-(a) That Lord Cecil of Chelwood shouldrep-resent G-reat Britain on theCommittee set up by the Council ofthe League of Nations to considerthe composition of the Council.(Lord Cecil expressed his willingness t6 undertake this responsibility.)(b) That before Lord Cecil leaves toattend the first meeting, thequestion should be discussed atthe Cabinet.
3. The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to a despatch in &quot;The Tiroes&quot; newspaper of Tuesday, April13th,. from their Riga Correspondent, stating thatthe Executive Bureau of the Soviet Trade UnionInternational of Moscow has held a meeting especially to decide in what form and in what- degree it ispossible to support the British miners in a conflict with the mine-owners.    The question was raised asto whether some representation ought to be made tothe Russian-Soviet Government in regard to thisalleged interference in a domestic controversy.The Cabinet were reminded that information from Riga had often proved inaccurate.    They were also  informed that the Russian representative inLondon at. the present time was only a Charge&apos;d&apos;Affaires in the Trade Delegation, and that theRussian Soviet Government had always declinedresponsibility for the actions of the Third Inter-national.The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs undertook to give carefulconsideration to a proposal thatattention should be drawn in some form to the alleged action of theThird International, in order toshow that the British Governmenthad taken note of it.
4.    The Cabinet had a general discussion inregard to the present position of the dispute inthe coal industry,.   The coal-owners had taken aposition-indicating a general willingness to acceptthe Report of the Royal Commission on the CoalIndustry, although their acceptance was rather lessdefinite than that of the Government.    The executive of the Miners&apos; Federation had first met the TradesUnion Council, and then a Delegate Conference.The latter had passed a resolution in favour ofno reduction :of wages, no lengthening of hours and no district settlements, which had had theeffect of tying the hands of their leaders and &apos;rendering any negotiations difficult.   The repre-sentatives of the miners were leaving for Brusselsthe same evening.in order to meet the InternationalMiners&apos;  Federation with a view to arranging forno foreign coal to be shipped to this country inthe event of a strike.    The representatives of theowners would be leaving the same evening for their districts, where they would invite discussion withthe men&apos;s leaders in regard to wages and hours, -an invitation which would inevitably be refused.The owners were expected to post notices almostat once terminating the present wage contracts on   .May 1st,, and they would probably be in a positionto announce the wages in the various districtsearly next week.&apos; The discussion, revealed a general consensusof opinion in the Cabinet to the following effect:-
That up to the present time the Governmenthad had public opinion with them in theirattitude:That the position taken up by the mine-owners had not reacted adversely on publicopinion:That it was very important that the mine-owners should not antagonise public opinion by offering inadequate wages in the variousdi str ic ts :That the Prime Minister or one of hiscolleagues should see the mine-ownersbefore they left for their districts, inorder to impress this upon them:That any assistance given by the Governmentshould not go beyond easing the temporarysituation caused by the ending of thesubsidy in conformity with the PrimeMinisters statement to the Mining Associa-tion and Miners&apos;  Federation on March 25th(Paper CP.-131 (26)), but that it was undesirable at the moment to make a state-ment as to the precise form that such assistance should take,  provided that thegeneral principle as to  its purely temporarycharacter was maintained.    This  sho\ild bemade clear,  if necessary, as the experienceof industrial disputes of this kind was thatthe parties thereto would postpone seriousefforts for a settlement until the very lastmordent, in the hope o^ obtaining further government assistance:That the most hopeful prospect of averting  .a strike was to be found in the action ofthe Trades Union Council. .
At the and of the discussion the PrimeMinister said that he would proceed on the general lines as summarised above,  and would summon theCabinet Committee or, in case of necessity, theCabinet, in the event of any development of thesituation requiring a decision.

the Home Secretary regarding the working of thelaw relating to the closing hours of shops (paper cp,-143 (26)) .Some doubt was expressed as to whether itwas desirable to reopen the question by appoint-ing a Select Committee to examine the working ofthe Acts of 1912 and .1920,The Home Secretary was asked todiscuss the matter with the chief whip., with a view to avoiding a select Committee,  if possible.
