The Cabinet assembled, as arranged, at 9-30p.tp.   At 11-15 p.m. they we.re joined by the PrimeMinister, the Secretary of State for India andthe Minister of Labour, whov since 9 P.m., hadbeen in conference with three representativesof the Committee of the Trades Union Council.The Secretary of State for India reported tothe Cabinet that all the points raised at theYCabinet the same day had been put to the repre-sentatives of the Trades Union Council.   Afterconsiderable discussion the representatives ofthe Trades Union Council Committee had been asked what was the uttermost point to which they could go, and Lord Birkenhead had written down thefollowing words of their reply:-&quot;We will urge the miners to authoriseus to enter upon a dis cuss ion withthe understanding that they and we accept the Report as a basis of settlement and we approach it withthe knowledge that it may involve some reduction in wages&quot;.The representatives of the Trades Union CouncilCommittee had also explained that they acceptedthe principle of the formula produced at -the endof the discussion on the-previous evening, butrecognised that it merely conveyed the impressionproduced on the mind of the Prime Minister of the atmosphere of the conversations.   As regards themeasures taken by certain Trades Unions in regardto a General Strike, they maintained that noirrevocable step had been taken, and said that allwould be wi.thdra\vn at once if the conversationsresulted in a resumption of negotiations.    Inaccordance with the Cabinet decision, the documentdrawn up at the previous meeting of the Cabinet
-327had not yet been c omnranic at ed to the repre-sentatives of the Trades Union Council commit-tee.   Some discussion had taken plaoe on thequestion of publicity, and they had taken theview that the conversations should be regardedas private and that it was desirable in thegeneral interest that there should be a group of representatives on either side who coulddiscuss matters on a confidential basis.At the end of the conversation the representa-tives of the Trades Union Council Committee had withdrawn to sound the miners&apos; representativesas to whether they would accept the formulaquoted above, but the Government representatives were quite uncommitted.   ;A discussion by the Cabinet followed inregard to the position, mainly on the questionof whether the document drawn up at the previous meeting of the Cabinet (Appendix to Cabinet 2%(S6)) should now be communicated to the TradesUnion Council Committee.   In the course of this discussion the Home. Secretary read a communique.he wished to send to the Press. &apos; Shortly after,authentic information was received to the effeotthat certain employes in the office of the&apos; &quot;Daily Mail&quot; had declined to print a leadingarticle, and that the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; would not bepublished on the morrow.This information, coupled with the evidence&apos;of specific instructions directing members ofcertain Trades Unions in several of the mostvital industries and services of the countryto carry out a General Strike on Tuesday next,was felt&apos;lto introduce a new factor in tho
situation, and it was. agreed that negotiationsoould not he continued without a repudiationWhitehall Gardens, S.W.1,May 2,  1926.by the Trades Union Council Committee of the actions referred to and an immediate and uncon-ditional withdrawal of the instructions for ageneral strike.   The document approved at theprevious meeting was accordingly re-drafted tomeet the new situation, and the Cabinet agreed      1That the Prime Minister should communicate to the Trades union council Committee the documentattaohed in the Appendix.
Q9Qzj w vAPPENDIX.His Majesty1 s Government believe that no solution ofthe difficulties in the coal industry which is both practicaljnd honourable to all concerned can be reached except by sincereacceptance of the Report of the Commission.   In the expression&quot;acceptance of the Report&quot; is included both the reorganisation of the industry, which should be put in hand immediately, and,landing the results of the reorganisation being attained, suchinterim adjustment of wages or hours of work as will make itsconomically possible to carry on the industry in the meantime.If the miners or the Trade Union Committee on their behalf wereprepared to say plainly that they accept this proposal, theC-overnment would have been ready to resume the negotiations andto continue the subsidy for a fortnight.But since the discussions which have taken place between ministers and members of the Trade Union Committee it has cometo the knowledge of the Government not only that specific in-structions have been sent (under the authority of the Executivesof Trade Unions represented at the conference convened by theC-eneral Council of the Trades Union Congress) directing their members in several of the most vital industries and services ofthe country to carry out a general strike on Tuesday next, butthat overt acts have already taken place, including gross inter-ference with the freedom of the Press ,    Such action involves a challenge to the Constitutional Rights and freedom of thenation.His Majesty&apos;s Government,  therefore, before it can continuenegotiations, must require from the Trade Union Committee botha repudiation of the actions referred to that have already taken place and an immediate and unconditional withdrawal of theIns true tlons for a gene r al s tr ike.wning Street, . .  *3rd May, 19S6.
