SITUATION. 1.      The Cabinet assembled at 5 p.m., butCabinet were informed that the Committee of the Tradesonclusion 1.Union Council would not be in a position tosend an answer on the points presented to them on the previous evening before 6 p.m.After an adjournment, the Cabinetreassembled at 6.45 p.m.(The Lord Chancellor left at this point).Shortly after, the Cabinet were informedthat the Committee of the Trades Union council would be glad of an interview with the PrimeMinister;    the Committee had not been able toget Into touch withbthe Miners&apos; representativesbut desired some instructions In regard to theformula communicated on the previous evening.The Cabinet then proceeded to discuss severaldrafts which had been prepared by Members for- communication before, at or after an interview with the Trades Union Council, dealing first withthe need for acceptance of the Royal Commission&apos;sReport, including an adjustment of wages or hoursof work, and secondly, with the Information that had come to hand as to the orders given by certain Unions for a general strike.   After some discussion, several Ministers left in order toprepare a fresh draft.The Cabinet agreed:(a) That the Prime Minister and those ofhis colleagues who had accompanied him at the previous meeting should interviewthe Committee of the Trades Union council at 9.p.m. &apos;
(b) That the remainder of the Cabinet shouldassemble   in the house of ,the Chancellorof the Exchequer at 9.30 p.m. in orderto be available for consultation bythe Prime Minister during his negotiations.(c) To approve the document in the Appendixfor communication to the Committee ofthe Trades Union Council, If after9 p.m.interview this was deemeddesirablej
0) TRANSPORT 2.     During the discussion recorded in&amp;tion.Conclusion I, the Home Secretary was authorisedce cabinet conclusion 2*     to dispatch the telegrams to put intooperation the arrangements prepared by theSupply and Transport Committee for the-emergency of a general strike, and left theCabinet for a few minutes for this purpose.
APPENDIX.- His Majestyfs Government believe that no solution of the difficulties in the coal industry whichis both practical and honourable to all concerned canbe reached except by sincere acceptance of the Reportof the Commisfcien.      In the expression &quot;acceptance ofthe Report&quot; is included both the reorganisation ofthe industry which should be put in hand immediately and such interim adjustments of wages or hours ofwork as will make it economically possible to carry onthe industry in the meantime.     If the miners, or theTrade Union Committee on their behalf, are prepared tosay plainly that they accept this proposal the -Government is ready to resume the negotiations and tocontinue the subsidy for a fortnight.But since the discussions which took place last night between Ministers and members of the Trade UnionCommittee, it has come to the- knowledge of the Governmenttha* specific Instructions have been sent under theauthority of the General Council Of the Trades UnionCongress directing their members in several of themost vital Industries and services of the country tocarry out a General Strike on Tuesday next.     Suchaction would involve a challenge to the Constitutionalrights and freedom of the nation.     The Government must therefore require from the Trade Union Committee an unconditional withdrawal of this threat before it can continue negotiations.
