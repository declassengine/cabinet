INDUSTRIALIS.vious&apos;inet 24,), Con-jsion 5.;The Cabinet met to consider the present posi-tion in regard to the industrial crisis and themeasures required to cope with the situation.The reports before the Cabinet were to theeffect that there were ample supplies of food,transport, and petrol, and that the Supply andTransport Organisation was working smoothly.The most serious need of the moment, however, was more protection, in view of the intimidationalready carried out and threatened.   The TradesUnion Council had now prohibited the movement of flour, and the National Union of Railwaymen had ordered permits&apos;for the movement of foodstuffs to be cancelled.    This meant that strongermeasures would be taken in the direction ofpicketing the docks and other food supplies.In addition, it was known that certain trades union not at present on strike would be called out, and it was by no means improbable that thiswould extend to postal workers, including tele-graphists and telephonists .Particulars were given to the Cabinet of certainplans made for protecting the movement of food-stuffs in the area normally fed from the Port ofLondon, which involved,  inter alia, the temporaryuse of troops in the London Docks area for protec-tion purposes ..After considerable discussion, the cabinet agreed -(a) That the provision of furtherprotection was the first essen-tial in the present situation,and that, with a view to any possible developments, the forces available for this purpose shouldbe expanded on a considerable scale:-1-
(b) That the general principles on whichprotection should be based should be-as follows:-(i) Regular troops should only beused in the last resort, andshould,  as far as possible, bekept away from the disturbedareas until the moment for theirus e had a rriv ed:(ii) That the first line on whom fellthe responsibility for providingprotection was the regular Police,and that  the Home Secretary shouldhave authority to augment them byrecruiting Special Constables onthe present1- lines up to thelargest scale deemed practicable and necessary, both in London andin the country.    In London, forexample, he was given discretion to announce that the number ofSpecial &quot;Constables would beincreased up to 50,000:(iii)  That in addition to the Military(who must be regarded as the lastreserve) and the Special Confetables,a specialy^lvil Force should beraised as part of the Police,which should be organised for actionin units.    In this latter connec-tion the proposal which commendeditself to the Cabinet was thatunits of the Territorial army should be invited to volunteeras a whole for service in thisCivil Force, should be sworn asSpecial Constables, and should form the. nucleus of  a special section of thePolice forces:(c) That a Cabinet Committee, composed asfollows:-The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Home Secretary,The Secretary of State for War,(Major Ismay, Secretary),should meet in the Chancellor of theExchequer&apos;&apos;a Room at the House ofCommons at 3 p.m. on the same after-noon to work out details with regardto the Civil Force referred to above in (b)(iii) and to arrange theDepartmental responsibility, with full authority from the Cabinet toput the arrangements concerted intoimmediate operation:(d) That the /reserves of the fighting forces should not be called out:
(e) That the Territorial Army as suaoh     -  ,should not be called out&quot;:( f) That the Secretary of State for War&quot;should have authority to issue instructions to the General OfficersCommanding permitting the use of&quot;tear&quot; gas in any case where a situation became 30-serious as to involve the alternative between that course and the use of fire-arms :(g) To take note and approve the actionof the Secretary of state  for Warin making available as many armoured cars as possible:(h) That, with reference to the antici-pated strike o^ postal employes,the Postmaster-General should have authority, whenever he deemed themoment appropriate, to issue a warning as to the consequences to established Civil Servants whodeserted their posts.    The questionof whether he should state thatthey were not only liable todismissal but whether he shouldalso mention the loss of pension rights was left to his discretion:(i) To take note that the First Lordof the Admiralty had already authorised the issue of a warning to certain Admiralty employeswho were on strike:ij) To take note that, while unnecessaryexpenditure is to be avoided, theChancellor of the Exchequer will find the funds necessary for themeasures atithorised by the Cabinet:(k) That a Cabinet Committee,  composed as follows  36The Lord Chancellor,The Secretary of State for India,The Attorney-General,(Mr R.B. Howorth, Secretary) -should meet to consider what legisla-tion, if any, to strengthen thepowers of the Government is necessary and possible, either at the present justice or in the near future.At an earlier stage 0^ the Cabinet, it had beenarranged that the Home Secretary should discuss with the Attorney-General and the Secretary ofState for India the question Of whether recentaction taken by certain Trades Unions to inter-rupt the carriage of foodstuffs was a breach of
the existing law and whether any action was required in consequence thereof.It is assumed that the Cabinet&apos;s intention is that the Home Secretary should discuss this  question with the above Committeewhich is reviewing the same subject from a wider aspect.Whit ehal 1 Gardens , S .W. 1,May 7,  1926.
