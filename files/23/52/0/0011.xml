THE BLOOMSBURY SITE.



(Previous Reference: Cabinet 18 (25), Conclusion 7).



9. The First Commissioner of Works asked for a decision as a matter of urgency in regard to the Bloomsbury Site which is the subject of a Report by the Cabinet Committee on the London University, King&apos;s College and the Imperial Institute (C.P. 113(26)). Since the completion of this Report on the previous day Lord Peel had received a representation from Sir William Beveridge, the Director of the London School of Economics, to the effect that he anticipated that he could obtain a resolution from the Senate of the University in favour of accepting the Bloomsbury Site and that the necessary money for erecting the buildings could be raised.

The Senate, however, could not be assembled before March 25th. Lord Peel, therefore raised the question as to whether the action recommended by the Cabinet Committee (viz. the writing of a letter before the 1st April offering the Duke of Bedford the Bloomsbury Site in terms of the Conveyance of the 23rd March, 1921, etc.) should be postponed.

The Cabinet felt that the matter was one on which they could not take a decision without further information and agreed:-

(a) That the Cabinet Committee should have authority to carry on negotiations in regard to Sir William Beveridge&apos;s communication but to take no decision.

(b) To reserve the main decision to an early Meeting.

He had already had an opportunity of consulting the Ghaneellor of the Exchequer, the Seoretary ofState for War, and the Minister of Labour who agreedthat Sir Austen Chamberlain should be given the authorityfor whioh he asked.   If this course were takenSir Austen Chamberlain would have authority to aooedeto a recommendation by the Council in favour^of thecreation of two now permanent seats on the Council ofthe League An September in favour of Spain and Brazil.The Assembly, of course, would have the right to rejectthis proposal.   In the course of the discussion theSecretary of State for the Dominions said he hadreceived a telegram,dated on the day before Sir austen chamberlain&apos;?
