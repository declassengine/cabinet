Servants &apos; towards the strike.The Chancellor of the Exchequer invited the President of the Board of Trade to forward to him the documents, which hadbeen distributed, and undertook tohave the matter examined in the treasury and to forward a report.
b PRESS AND   5&quot;*       The Cabinet gave consideration to the futureb BRITISHiuiETTE. policy to b-e adopted in regard to the!british Gazett(previous which had been published as a Government newspaperInferenceToinet 28(26^ since the beginning of the strike,inclusion 4. )The Cabinet were informed that on the eve ofthe strike the Newspaper Proprietors had met and had decided that they could hot produce a newspaper.They had advised that a Government Bulletin should bproduced.     At the Prime Minister&apos;s request theChancellor of the Exchequer had convened the whole 0the metropolitan and provincial newspaper interestsof the oountry (the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; excepted).The press representatives had declared themselvesunable -(i)    to produce their own papers; and(ii)    to combine for the production of asingle newspaper, and had suggestedthat a paper should be produced bythe Stationery Office to which theywould render any assistance in their power.It was upon this suggestion that theGovernment had acted.The &quot;Morning Post&quot; had offered its plant andbelieved that it s staff would remain,     Nearly thewhole of the staff had, however, gone on strike,but with the aid of one or two loyal key men,subsequently supplemented by a few (three) more,whose services were lent by the &quot;Dally Express&quot;and seven by the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and of volunteerlabour, mainly supplied by undergraduates, theBritish Government had in the course of little overa week, achieved an output of over two millioncopies, which would the same evening be distributed
all over England,  and had become the main means bywhich the Government had been enabled to frustrate the attempt of the Trades Union Congress Councilto stifle information,  and to keep the nationinformed as to the true situation.The following questions were raised forconsiderat ion:-(l)    As to whether, now that the usual pressis beginning to appear in increasingcirculation, the information andarticles supplied for the &quot;BritishGazette&quot; should be made available forthe whole of the metropolitan and provincial press.(2)    As to whether all stocks of paper inwarehouses should be released from theGovernment embargo and made availableto the normal press.,(3)    As to whether the ordinary netrspapersshould now be left free to publish asmeans permitted and to take the placeof the &quot;British Gazette&quot;, which wouldthen be withdrawn,  or whetheralternatively, arrangements should bemade to ensure fair treatment inrecommencing normal publication tothose newspapers whose personnel ormaterial was at present engaged in&apos;producing the &quot;British Gazette&quot;,On the first point the Cabinet were informedthat every copy of the &quot;British Gazette&quot; contained astatement permitting the reproduction of articlesappearing therein,  and that early &quot;pulls&quot; of the newspaper were made available to the whole press.On the second point they were informed that theexisting stocks of paper would be exhausted within four days,  but that arrangements had been made to relieve the situation before the expiration of thatperiod.On the third point the Cabinet were informedthat certain newspapers had made sacrifices in orderto contribute to the success of the &quot;British Gazette&quot;
while rival newspapers, which had not given any assistance to the Government organ, had &quot;been increasing their normal circulation.The Chancellor of the Exchequer expressed hiedesire to bring the Gazette to an end as soon as the daily newspapers were in a position to resume normalpublication but he insisted that this resumption mustbe carried out on terms fair to all and that thosepapers which had given help to the Government in the crisis should not suffer prejudice because of theirpatriotism.     In this connection the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer informed his colleagues that the &quot;daily express&quot; was likely soon to attempt the production ofan evening paper on a large scale.    He had receivedinvaluable assistance from this paper and from itscommercial rival,  the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;,    If one started,the other was bound to follow suit,  and the withdrawalof the key men supplied from these two newspapersfrom the offices of the &quot;British Gazette&quot; would resultin a great deterioration in that organ, which,  even ifits publication could be continued at all, would thenbe less valuable to the Government in the later stages of the strike.    He had promised the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; that,if they lent their staff for the production of the&quot;British Gazette&quot;, he would see that their rivals didnot get started ahead of them.    He was hoping thatthe &quot;Daily Express&quot; would not be in a position to start its evening edition before Wednesday, May19th, and he hoped to be able to Becure this by arrangement.     But he warned the Cabinet that, if this proved impossible he might, pending a decision bythe Cabinet, have to use his discretionary powers tosecure fair play in accordance with Ms promise.
The Chanoellor of the Exchequer undertook tocall a meeting on the following day of representativesof the Metropolitan and Provincial Press in order toascertain their views, and to discuss the possibilityand desirability of making some equitable arrangement regard to the date of the general resumption of  -newspapers.General appreciation waB expressed ofthe success achieved by the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the Cabinetadjourned their decision pending this conference.
