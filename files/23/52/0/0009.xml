1. Th9 Prime Minister called attention to afurther leakage vhich had occurred in &quot;The daily express&quot; on Monday, March 1st, in regard to&apos; theCabinet Committee&apos;s proposals for the Reform ofthe House of Lords.The Cabinet were informed, however, thatthere was. strong internal evidence that the writerof the article in question could not have seen theactual Report of the Committee, as very importantdetails had been omitted.The Cabinet felt, in these circumstances,that it was not a case in which action should betaken . .
gE COUNCILjp TUBr,BACrUB OFleference:cabinet 726). Con-elusion 11 a;2.   The Cabinet resumed their discussion on thesubject of the claims for permanent membership ofthe Council of the League of Nations put forward by-certain States on the occasion of the proposedadmission of Germany.In this connection the Cabinet had before them,in addition to the Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs on Poland&apos;s olaim for apermanent seat on the Council (Paper C.P.-40 (26)),&amp; telegram from the Prime Minister of Australiadated March 2, 1926 (Dominions Qffioe Telegram No.43) .After discussing all aspects of the question the Cabinet agreed -(a) That, subject to the Secretary of statefor Foreign Affairs and the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster havingdiscretion to make the best arrange-ment they can in accordance with thedevelopment of the situation, theirattitude towards claims for permanentmembership of the Council of the league should be based on the following prin-oiples(i) No change in the Council canbe admitted which would havethe effect of preventing ordelaying the entry of Germany.It would be best that germany should, as a member of the Council,have full responsibility for anyfurther change in the Councilbeyond her own admission:(ii) The rule that only Great powers should be permanent members ofthe Council should in principlebe maintained.    Spain is in aspecial position and may requireexceptional treatrtent:(iil) Neither Poland nor Brazil shouldbe made permanent members at .present.   But Poland should begiven a non-permanent seat as soonas possible:(b) That, In order to provide an adequateopportunity for discussion of thisquestion in Parliament before the depart-ure for Geneva of the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs and the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster, the PrimeMinister should move the adjournment
of the House of Commons onThursday, March 4th, whichwould enable the Debate tobe continued until 8-15, whensv Private Member&apos;s Bill wouldbe taken.
jjlAQ POLICY. 3. The Cabinet had before there the Report of aCabinet Committee on Iraq. Policy (Paper CP.-89 (26)).[previous&apos;Reference: It was represented to the Cabinet that Para-Oabinet 7(26), Ooh- graph 11 of the Draft Report and the correspondingoiusion 1(c) ,)passage in the Conclusions were rather too negativetowards the possibility of enabling the Turks toreceive a share of the oil royalties, and it wassuggested that it might be well worth while for Iraq,in order to secure her position and reduce herexpenditure on defence, to make some payment to turkey if a suitable basis for such payment couldbe found.The Cabinet approved the Report ofthe Cabinet Committee (Paper C.P.-89 (26)), subject to the followingalterations:-Paragraph 11, last paragraph:*Under the present arrangementstJhe Irak Government is to get 4s.per ton of oil produced.   The objeo-tions to asking Irak to forgo a portion of what may turn out to beher principal source of income arevery considerable., both on grounds of sentiment and of practical equity.This alternative., therefore, offersno opportunity for a concession to turkey.   If, however, this ajterna-tive should turn out to be essentialto a settlement. His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would be prepared toconsider it&quot;.Paragraph 15 (6):&quot;The good offices of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to obtain for Turkey some. form of participation in the TurkishPetroleum Company&apos;s concession-.   as explained in paragraph 11 above thedifficulties in this direction are   ;at present great, but if essentialto a settlement His Majesty&apos;sGovernment   will   be prepared toconsider this question&quot;.(The amended words are underlined-.)(A copy, of the Report as finally approved/ by the Cabinet is appended to these conclusions.) &quot;
4.    The Cabinet &apos;&amp;pprovad the following Conclu-eion by the Committee of Imperial Defence, taken at their SIOth Ms ;ting on February 85, 1926, in&quot;previous reference:Cabinet 3(26), Con-elusion 10.)regard to the withdrawal of two Infantry Battalionsfrom Iraq!-&quot;That no alteration had taken plaoein the situation vis-Sr-vis Turkeysince the 26th January, 1926, whenthe matter was last under consider-atlon, which would justify any departure from the conclusion thenreached to the effect that the two additional infantsy battalions shouldbe withdrawn from Iraq during thepresent trooping season, and that therefore this withdrawal should now be carried but as arranged&quot;.
O0-ORDINATIONOp RESEARCHEXPENDITURE.(previous kef reference e:Cabinet 8(26), Con-elusion 2.)5.   The Cabinet had before them a Note by theSecretary of the Cabinet forwarding the following recommendation of the Standing Committee on expenditure:-&quot;That the Committee of Civil research should be invited to inquire generallyInto the expenditure on Research atpresent defrayed from the CivilService Estimates and from Navy, Armyand Air Force Votes, with reference in particular to ascertaining whether -(l)  substantial overlapping exists:(2) the results obtained^fullyjustify the expenditure:(3)  the various research activitiescould be consolidated and, if so,to what extent&quot;.(Paper CP.-83 (.26)) .In the absence of the Lord Presidentof the Council and the Chancellorof the Exchequer the question was adjourned.
6. The Cabinet had before them the Draft Minutesof the Committee of Imperial Defence, together with aMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies and Remarks by the Oversea Sub-Committee of theCommittee of Imperial Defence on the proposed creationof an European Defence Force in Kenya (Paper CP .-88(25))6The Secretary of State for the Colonies informed the Cabinet that, on the suggestion of the Committeeof Imperial Defence, he had thought it right to draw their attention to this matter as one of the draftordinances for the Kenya Defence Force which he proposed to approve was baaed on the principle of compulsion in an emergency, and for this reason hadbeen refused by hia predecessor.    Feeling in theColony, however, *?as strongly favourable to theproposal, for which he mentioned several precedentswithin the Empire,While reoognising the possibility that thequestion might in due course be raised in Parliament,the Cabinet authorised the Secretary of State forthe Colonies to approve the ordinances in regardto the creation of an European Defence Force in kenya.
sUppiY ANDTRANSPORTORGANISATION,previous reference:Cabinet 2(86), Con-elusion7.   The Cabimt had. before them a Progress Reportby the Home Secretary In regard to the Supply andTransport Organisation (Paper CP.-81 (26)).The Home Secretary stated that he would beprepared to show the details of the arrangements to any Cabinet Minister who wished to see them.The Cabinet took note with satisfaction of the Home Secretary&apos;s Progress Report.
THE industrial situation.Crisis in theEngineeringIndustry.(previous reference reference e:Cabinet 27(24). Con-elusion 8.)8.   The Cabinet had before there a Memorandum bythe Minister of Labour in regard to a crisis in theEngineering Industry (Paper C.P.-90 (26)) ,The Minister of Labour made a short statement in regard to the latest developments of theindustrial crisis, the situation in regard to whichwas now serious.   He indicated, however, that itwould be difficult to judge what developments were likely to occur until after certain meetings that were to take place on Friday next.
THE COUNTY 9 . The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bykOROUSHS BILL.w the Ministry of Health (Paper CP.-85 (26))covering the draft County Boroughs Bill, which hasbeen drafted to give effect to recent recommendationsof the Royal Commission on Local Government,together with the recommendation of the Committeeof Home Affairs thereon (H.A.C 4th Conclusions (26)Para.2).The Cabinet agreed  To authorise the introduction inthe House of Lords of the county boroughs Bill in the fonn of thedraft annexed to CP.-85 (26),subjeot to any drafting altera-tions that may be found necessary.

i IfwgST INDIES. 12. The First Commissioner of Works gave theparliamentary       Cabinet a short account, of his visit to the WestDeputation to,Indies at the head of a Parliamentary Deputation.They had been most hospitably and enthusiasticallyreceived in the various Colonies, most of whichhad made requests of various kinds for assistance,which he had passed on to the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies,   Among the points on which hedwelt were:-   that Bermuda alone of the Coloniesvisited requires nothing and is prosperous, livingon the American tourist traffic;    British Guianarequires a great deal, as the country is almost wholly undeveloped, but he entirely endorsed theaction of the Secretary of State for the colonies in refusing a loan for a railway, few details ofwhich had been worked out;    in many of the Coloniescoloured men were coming more and more into theAssemblies and official positions;   most of the islands felt that they were rather a neglected partof the Empire and their material prosperity depended on products such as sugar, cocoa and coffee, onthe prices of which they could exercise no influence.If there was one thing which could help these loyalColonies more &quot;than another it would be some concession in regard to the entry of their produce of sugar.The Cabinet thanked Lord Peel for undertakingthis Deputation.The Secretary of State for the Dominionsindicated the desirability of some Cabinet Minister,if possible^ accompanying the Parliamentary Deputa-tion that was to proceed to Australia later in theGardens,ys!w.0l, ....March 3, 1926.&apos;
APPENDIX.SECRET.CP. 89 (26).(Revise.)CABINET.IRAK POLICY COMMITTEE.REPORT.AT a meeting of the Cabinet held on the 17th February, 1926 (Cabinet 6 (26),Conclusion 2), the Cabinet, at the request of the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, agreed That a Cabinet Committee, composed as follows :- The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (in the Chair),The Lord Privy Seal,The Secretary of State for the Colonies,The Secretary of State for War,The Secretary of State for Air,The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,The Under-Secretary of State, India Office (nominated by the Secretary ofState for India),should meet to advise the Cabinet upon the instructions to be given to the british ambassador in Constantinople for his guidance in negotiations with Turkey.2. The Committee met on the 24th February, and, at the request of the foreign secretary, Lord Salisbury took the Chair. At this meeting they had the advantageof hearing the views of Sir Henry Dobbs, High Commissioner for Irak, on those questions in which Irak itself is intimately concerned.3. The Committee commenced its enquiries with an exhaustive examination ofvarious proposals for securing a general settlement with Turkey under the following headings: (a.) A treaty whereby Turkey&apos;s neighbours would guarantee her integrity, andwould undertake to come to her assistance if attacked.(&amp;.) A Pact whereby Turkey, of the one part, and all or some of her neighbours,of the other part, recognised her frontiers as final, and undertook not toattack one another.(c.) A guarantee of the Turco-Irak frontier only, coupled with an undertaking to submit to arbitration any disputes arising in respect of that frontier.(d.) Readjustments of the Brussels line laid down by the League Council on the16th December, 1925.(e.) The extension of the Baghdad Railway to Mosul from its present Easternterminus at Nisibin.(/.) Reassurances to the Turks regarding our policy towards the Kurds inIrak.(g-) A Turco-Irak Extradition Treaty.(h.) Commercial agreements.(*.,) An invitation to Turkey to join the League of Nations.[14266a]
The views of the Committee in regard to these proposals, and the considerationsby which the Committee were guided, are summarised in the following paragraphs : A Treaty of Guarantee.4. It is not practical politics for Great Britain to guarantee the frontiers ofTurkey against aggression, and to associate with herself in this action France, ItalyPersia, Greece, Bulgaria and possibly Russia. The difficulties of inducing the other powers-and especially Italy and Russia to come in are likely to be insuperableand public opinion at home, already uneasy at the extension of the Mandate in Irakwould be seriously alarmed at this additional liability.A Pact of Non-Aggression.5. The less ambitious proposal for a pact of non-aggression between GreatBritain and Turkey, on the lines of the recent Russo-Turkish Treaty, is open to twobjections. Firstly, it requires a stringent saving clause to safeguard our obligations under Article 16 of the Covenant, and any mention of the League of Nations, at anyrate, short of according Turkey the full rights enjoyed by Members of the League(see paragraph 12 below) is most distasteful to Turkey in view of the Council&apos;s recentaward. Secondly, it would be unworkable without a system of compulsory arbitration, Avhich is contrary to the policy hitherto followed by His Majesty&apos;Government at Geneva and Locarno.Guarantee of the Turco-lrak Frontier.6. A strictly limited guarantee of this nature has several advantages. Itshould allay Turkey&apos;s fears, amounting to an obsession, that our demands for theextension of Irak northwards will never cease, and thus tend to give her that sense of security which she needs, at any rate as regards one of her frontiers.Readjustments of the Brussels Line.7. (a.) There is no objection on strategical or other grounds to ceding to turkey the two salients at the Eastern end of the Brussels line, provided there is noquestion of the transfer of any considerable population.(ft.) It would, however, be a mistake, and possibly vitiate the wholenegotiations, to demand in return for these salients a quid pro quo, such as a strip of territory in the Tiari country North of the Brussels line.(c.) Any cession to Turkey of territory to the South of the two salients, extendingas far as Rowanduz, would be dangerous not only on strategical, but also on general grounds,for the following reasons :  (i.) Rowanduz is the key to the whole position in South-Eastern Kurdistan;it was taken by British forces three years ago, after an operation ofgreat difficulty.(ii.) The abandonment of this district would cause grave discontent among theIraki Kurds; it would alienate from us a population which is nowespecially friendly, and have a very unsettling effect throughout Irak,(iii.) The recently appointed Kurdish chief over all this district is a man whohas been sentenced to death in Turkey, and we clearly could no&apos;abandon him to the Turks.(iv.) A withdrawal from Rowanduz would not appease the Turks, and woulseriously Aveaken our strategical position. An early reduction of thImperial units in Irak would thus be rendered impossible, and thexpenditure on those units would be prolonged.Extension of the Baghdad Railway to Mosul.8.   With regard to the proposal for the extension of the Baghdad Railway fro&quot;Nisibin, this might, to some extent, adversely affect the strategic problem of Irak;Nevertheless, other things being equal, the strategic disadvantages are outweighsby the political and commercial advantages which would ensue from a favourabloutcome of our conversations with Turkey.
It has not yet been definitely ascertained whether the Turks would appreciate the value of this proposal, but if they should show any inclination in that directionit might be possible to arrange for the completion of the line. This could be effecteddirectly by British capital in the Iraki section of it, and by a loan to Turkey for theTurkish section. Possibly, further financial &quot; gilding &quot; for the benefit of the Turksnii(,-ht be practicable. For the moment, however, the most that can be said toSir Ronald Lindsay is that, if he should find the Turkish Government attracted bythe prospect of the completion of the Baghdad Railway, the question would receiveconsideration.Reassurances regarding British Policy towards the Kurds.9. It is clear from Sir R. Lindsay&apos;s reports that it will be exceedingly difficultto convince the Turks that the liberal measures adopted in Irak, e.g., as regards theuse of the Kurdish language in the schools and courts, do not conceal an ulteriordesign to foster Kurdish separatism and political autonomy. An effort should,however, be made to reassure Turkey on the point that our whole efforts are concen-trated on making the Kurdish districts in Irak a part of Irak.Extradition Treaty.10. Turkey has frequently complained that criminals and malefactors, aftercommitting crimes on the Turkish side of the frontier, are able to obtain immunity from punishment by crossing into Irak territory. An agreement for the extraditionof fugitive offenders between Irak and Turkey might, therefore, appeal to theTurks; and His Majesty-&apos;s Government could use their good offices to bring this about.Commercial.11. With regard to the possibility of offering to the Turks a participation inthe oil concession in the hands of the Turkish Petroleum Company, the difficulties are very great.   The shares are at present allotted to four groups, viz. : (1.) The British (Anglo-Persian) Oil Company.(2.) The Anglo-Dutch Shell Company.(3.) The French Group.(4.) The American Group.This arrangement was only reached after protracted negotiations of considerabledifficulty, and it would be most undesirable to disturb it. In the event, however, ofthe American Group refusing to take up their shares which is unlikely thepossibility of providing something for Turkey might be reconsidered. As, however,the shares belong to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, they could hardly be expectedto hand them over to Turkey without compensation, which we should have toprovide.The alternative would be to offer the Turks a share of the oil royalties.Under the present arrangements the Irak Government is to get 4s. per ton of oil produced. The objections to asking Irak to forego a portion of what may turnout to be her principal source of income are very considerable, both on grounds of sentiment and of practical equity. If, however, this alternative should turn out to be essential to a settlement, His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared toconsider it.An Invitation to Join the League of Nations.12. Sir R. Lindsay&apos;s reports show that the main object of Turkey is to obtain a sense of real security within her own borders. This cannot be done by a guarantee to assist Turkey if attacked (see paragraph 4 above); but it could be pointed out toher that, in addition to the guarantee which we should be ready to give regardingthe Turco-Irak frontier only, she could obtain a great measure of security on herother frontiers if she came into the League. &quot;Her present distrust of the Leaguecould be met by the same arguments as were used in the case of Germany, namely,that the more Turkey is dissatisfied with the League, the greater the reason for her to seize the opportunity of obtaining a voice in the League&apos;s proceeedings. But thesuggestion might be approached upon much wider grounds. The Turkish Govern-Nent is anxious to qualify in all respects as an up-to-date Western Power.   It could
therefore be represented to them with great force that membership of the Leagueof Nations is the hall-mark of Western civilisation, and would be entirely in keeping with Angora&apos;s policy of making the new Turkish State thoroughly Western.Conclusions.13.   The general conclusions of the Committee are as follows : .It would be useless to send Sir R. Lindsay back to Angora, to resume negotiations with the Turks, unless he is in possession of all the proposals whichwe can entertain to be used, with the Turks as and when he thinks best. his instructions should indicate firstly, the proposals which His Majesty&apos;s Governmentare not prepared to countenance, viz., a treaty guaranteeing the integrity of turkey and undertaking to assist her if attacked; a pact of non-aggression in respect ofall Turkey&apos;s frontiers, with or without a system of compulsory arbitration; and areadjustment of the Brussels line which would hand over Rowanduz town and district to Turkey. Secondly, they should define the limits of what His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are prepared to offer to the Turks, viz. : (1.) An Anglo-Turkish treaty whereby Great Britain and Turkey mutuallyengage to respect as final the Turco-Irak frontier, and to submit to arbitration any disputes which arise in connection with that frontier,(2.) A readjustment of the Brussels line, not extending beyond the two salientsat its eastern end.(3.) Assurances to the effect that every precaution will be taken, as regardsadministrative measures in the Kurdish parts of Irak, to prevent those districts becoming a menace to Turkey&apos;s administration of her ownKurdish provinces.(4.) A suggestion to Turkey that the best way in which she can secure a completesense of security on all her frontiers is to join the League of Nations,as all progressive European States have done, and thus obtain thebenefits which all Member States enjoj^ under the Covenant.(5.) Consideration of the extension of the Baghdad Railway from Nisibin toMosul if the Turkish Government is attracted by the prospect. (But seeparagraph 8 above.) &apos;(6.) The good offices of His Majesty&apos;s Government to obtain for Turkey some form of participation in the Turkish Petroleum Company&apos;s concession.As explained in paragraph 11 above the difficulties in this direction areat present great, but if essential to a settlement, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment will be prepared to consider this question.(7.) It is also perhaps worth consideration whether we could probably offer our good offices to secure the conclusion of a Turco-Irak extradition treaty.It is recognised that none of. these proposals, taken by itself, will offer muchattraction to the Turks, and that even taken together, they fall considerably short of the more ambitious scheme (a guarantee of Turkish integrity, plus a substantial modification of the Brussels line), which Sir R. Lindsay seems to regard as theminimum required to satisfy Angora. At the same time as a whole they give Turkeygreater benefits than the terms of the recent Russo-Turkish Treaty, which was hailedas a triumph at Angora; and they are probably not less attractive for Turkey thanthe terms to which she has just agreed with alacrity in the Turco-Syrian agreementnegotiated by M. de Jouvenel.14. It is important that Sir R. Lindsay should receive his instructions earlyin March, as the season is approaching in April when there will be greater dangerof incidents and unrest on the Brussels line owing to the melting of the snow on the mountains. The terms contained in this Report might, if the Cabinet agree, be transmitted to him by telegraph so that in case he desired to make any representation in respect of them there might be time to give them consideration., - Signed on behalf of the Committee,SALISBURY, Chairman.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,March 1, 1926.
