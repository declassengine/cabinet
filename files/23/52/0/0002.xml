1. The Cabinet had before them the third draftof the King*a Speech (Paper CP.-9 (26)).   .. . .    18In regard to the first portion of the speech,dealing with Foreign and Imperial Affairs, attention was called to the separation of the passage dealingwith Iraq from that dealing with relations with turkey, although the two questions are closely connected.The Cabinet were inclined to think that thisseparation was deliberate in order not to connect thequestions too closely, and in the absence of theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs they did not feel entitled to make an alteration.After discussion on various other points, theCabinet agreed -(a) That the Prime Minister should arrange the order of the first three paragraphsafter discussion with the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs.    The PrimeMinister was also asked to consider asuggestion that the first paragraph-should b9 shortened by the omission of the words in line 2 &quot;on the 23rdDecember&quot;, and in line 3 &quot;in accord-ance with instructions&quot;:(b) The Italian Debt Settlement. That a passage should be inserted in the earl$ part of the King&apos;s Speech dealingwith the Italian Debt settlement, andthat the wording of the said passageshould be left to the Prime minister in agreement with the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer and the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs:(c) International Regulation of Hours ofWork.   That a passage should be inserted in the Eing&apos;s Speech in regard to theConference it is proposed to hold onthe subject of the international regulation of Hoiirs of Work, and thatthis passage should be drafted by the-Minister- of Labour ( See later, Con-clusjon 7):(d) That, in view of the contrast betweenthe length of the passage dealingwith the guarantee of loans to BritishDependencies and Mandated territories and the passage later in the draftdealing with the Electricity Bill,  itwas desirable to abbreviate the formerand to lengthen the latter so as tobring the references to these subjectsinto better perspective.    The precise
wording of the former passage was left to the Prime Minister in con-suit ati on with the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies.    One suggestion was,for the words &quot;loans to the amount of 10.000,000 for the development of theBritish dependencies in East africa and  4 000,000 for development inPalestine&apos;&apos; to substitute &quot;loans for the development of British pepend-encies and Mandated Territories&quot; omit-ting the specific reference to expend!-ture on Palestine, which in some quartersis unpopular.    A second suggestion wasto omit the last three lines &quot;beginning with the words &quot;The loans for EastAfrica&quot;.(Previous -Reference?Cabinet 28(23),  Con-conclusion 2.)(previous reference:Cabinet 1(26), Con-clusion 2.)(previous o\isReference:Cabinet 44(25) , Con-clusion 6(c).)The drafting of a passage to expandthe reference to the Electricity bill was left to the Prime Minister:(e) Credit Bank for Agriculture..   That the reference to the proposed establishmentof a Credit Bank for the assistance ofAgriculture should be reviewed and, ifnecessary, revised by the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the Minister of- Agriculture and Fisheries after theirConference with the heads of the fiveJoint Stock Banks the same afternoon(See later, Conclusion 3)*.(f) Housing.   That the revised draft of thepassage on the subject of Housing,submitted by the Minister of Health,should be adopted, the word &quot;improvement&quot;being substituted for the word &quot;removal&quot;in the 8th line:(g) Merchandise Marks Bill.    That the Presidentof the Board of Trade, in consultationwith the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries, should draft a new passagefor inclusion in the body of the KingfsSpeech, in regard to the MerchandiseMarks Bill, and that the reference tothis Bill in the penultimate paragraph should be deleted:(h) That in the penultimate paragraph thewords &quot;if time and opportunity permit&quot;should remain:(i) That the Secretary of the Cabinet should,through the proper channels, send allalterations in the King&apos;s Speech as soonas possible/to the Lord Privy Seal, as leader of the House of Lords;(j) To take note that the omission ofreferenoe to a Bill in the King&apos;s Speechdoes not imply that that Bill cannot beintroduced during the Session, andconsequently that, if Parliamentary timepermits, certain Bills at present omittedmay be introduced.
THF1 FACTORYBILL.(previous reference:Cabinet 61(35), Con-clusion 4.)3 o In the course of the discussion on the stibjtof the King&apos;s Speech, the Cabinet agreed  (a) That no reference to the Factory Billshould be made in the King&apos;s Speech:(b)(c)That the Homeauthorised toto the effect that, insigns of trade had decided not tomight be regarded as secretary should bemake an announcementview of thethe government step whichcalculated torevival,takehandicap industry and had come to theconclusion that it would be better to postpone the introduction of theFactory Bill for a year.Ths Home Secretary expressedhia intention of consulting the Prime Minister in regardto the terms of his announcement.That in the meanwhile the Home Secre-tary should have authority to take such steps as he might deem advisable with aview to preparing the way for andsecuring agreement in the terms of a factory Bill to be introduced in thefollowing year.

The coast defencevessels proposed were motor-boats intended for thepurpose of stopping smuggling.   In the absence ofinformation as to the design, their value was uncertain, but it was estimated they would requiresix months to complete.

13.    The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to a message from Dublin in &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper.reporting the introduction in the Dail of the land bill, 1926, the intention of which was alleged to beto assert definitely the finality of the IrishSupreme Court&apos;s authority in the Free State and toprevent frivolous appeals from that Court to theKing i n Counci1.The Lord Chancellor informed the Cabinetthat, in his opinion, the abolition of the rightof appeal to the Privy Council could only beeffected by a Statute passed in the imperial parliament.    It was, however, impossible to gatherfrom the message in &quot;The Times&quot; the precisepurport of the Bill.The Cabinet agreed --That the attention of the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs, whowas absent from the Cabinet owing toa political engagement, should bedrawn to &quot;The Times&quot; article, andthat if the provisions of the IrishLand Bill introduced in the Dailwere found to affect the constitu-tional position as regards appealsto the Privy Council, he should beasked,  in the first instance, to try and persuade the Irish FreeState Government not to press forward with the Bill, and, if the Dail should nevertheless pass the Bill, to instruct the Governor-General to.reserve the Royal Assent.
