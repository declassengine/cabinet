FOREIGNAFFAIRS.Conversa-tions withM.Mussoliniand M.Briand.Russia.previous reference:Cabinet 43(25), Con-clusion 1.)1.    The Secretary of State for &quot;Pox-eign affairs reported to the Cabinet the purport of the conversa-tions he had had with M. Mussolini and M. Briandduring his recent stay on the Continent.The conversation with M. Mussolini had been of a general oharacter, but his impression hadbeen--that the Italian Prime Minister was inclining moreand more to a League of Nations policy and to ageneral attitude similar to that of Great Britain.In his conversation with M. Briand, Sir austen chamberlain had met with an extremely reasonable attitude on the position arising out of the locarno treaty, notwithstanding the poor response by theGerman Government to the advances made by theAllies.   M. Briand had been equally reasonable on other questions, such as the Salonica-GhevgeliRailway, in regard to which he had been using hisgood offices;    the Hungarian forgeries; the policy towards Soviet Russia.2. As regards Soviet Russia, it appeareddifficult for the French Government to come to asettlement without securing satisfaction for the numerous French holders of Russian Bonds.M. Chicherin had repeated to M. Briand his favouritestory of there being a British conspiracy againstSoviet Russia, but M. Briand had marshalled theevidence to the contrary.    In the end, M. Chicherinhad asked if, in M. Briand&apos;s view, Sir austen chamberlain would see him if he desired it.For the moment there appeared to be no actxonnecessary on our part.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat, with a view to probing every aspect of thequestion before Parliament met,  the Foreign office had addressed a number of questions to the british minister at Pexln.    Sir Austen Chamberlain had notyet had time to master all the details of the presentposition, but it was clear that the men on the spotwere opposed to forcible action in South China.6. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that an unconfirmed report had been received of a settlement of the difficulty between Soviet.    .       .Russia and Afghanistan owing to the occupation bythe forces of the former of an island in the Oxus.If this was not confirmed he would have to discussthe question with the Secretary of State for india with a view probably to their bringing the matter before the Cabinet.
