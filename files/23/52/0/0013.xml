1,     The Cabinet had before them, in additionto the Papers available at the previous Meeting,a. revised form of announcement to be made bythe Prime Minister to the Mineowners and Miners(Paper CP. 128 (26)).Those Ministers who felt most strongly an objection to the principle of nationalisation ofroyalties waived their opposition on the understandingthat if either of the other parties to a settlementof the coal dispute made reservations in regard tothe Report of the Boyal Commission, the subject of purchase of royalties would again be brought beforethe Cabinet and discussed in the light of thenew circumstances.On this understanding the Cabinet agreed:-To approve the revised form of announcement&apos;*&apos;to be made by thePrime Minister to the Mineownersand Miners set forth in cp. 128 (26).The Government have considered with great care the report and conclusions of the Royal Commission.    The conclusions reached by the Commission do not in all respects accord withviews held by the Government and some of the recommendationscontain proposals to which, taken by themselves,  the Governmentare known to be opposed.     Nevertheless in face of the unanimous report of the Commission and fpr the sake of ageneral settlement the Government for their part will beprepared to undertake such measures as may be required of theState to give the recommendations effect, provided that those engaged in this industry - with whom the decision primarilyrests, agree to accept the Report and to carry on the industry on the basis of its recommendations.      It is our hope tnat inthat event by the co-operation of all parties it may bepossible to find in the Report a lasting solution of the problemPOUT 03?

2. The Cabinet had before them a second report of Lord Salisbury&apos;s Cabinet Committeeon Iraq. Policy (Paper CP.-120 (26)), whichhad been prepared as the result of a re-assemblyof the Committee to hear the views of HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador at Constantinople (SirRonald Lindsay).After some discussion, the Cabinet agreed(a) To approve the Second Reportof the Iraq Policy Committee(Paper C.P.-120 (26)), subjectto the amendment of paragraph 5to read as follows:-&quot;Reduction of Forces in Iragand Turkey.5. It is suggested that, inorder to convince the Turksof our pacific intentions andto demonstrate that we do notsuspect them of aggressivedesigns, we should   inform them, but net as a bargain,that it is our intention, ifa Treaty is signed,  to reducethe Imperial garrison in Iraqby one or two Air Squadronsand/or Battalions as soon a3climatic conditions n^nnvt, an^that we have made  rIIow^ucp forthis in our Estimates.   Thereduction of British forces mustof course be contingent on thecontinuance of a settled stateof affairs in Iraq&quot;.(b) That the Secretary of State forForeign. Affairs should take stepsto move the President of theCouneil of the League of Nations,in accordance with an authoritydevolved upon the latter by theCouncil at their last Meeting,to arrange for the return to theIraq frontier of neutral observers,who would report to the League onany frontier incident, but wouldbe paid for either by the Iraq orthe British Government.The arrangements as to defrayingthis latter expenditure were leftto the Secretary of State for theColonies, who undertook to ascertain whether it should be a charge upon
Iraq., and the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, who was willingto defray any legitimatelyBritish share (should this beproved to his satisfaction)up to a maximum of, say,  2,000
3. The Attorney-General made a verbal reportto the Cabinet as to the action he had takenin regard to the Conclusion of the cabinet referred to in the margin (which has hitherto been kept only in manuscript) that he shouldtake action, under the authority of the official secrets Act, to ascertain the source of certainleakages of information published by &quot;the daily Express&quot; .   The ultimate result of hisinquiries had been the discovery of the source of leakage, which had been a Temporary Clerkin a Government Department employed as asearcher for registered files.   This personhad abused the opportunities that his work gavehim for entering the rooms of certain officials to mazier part of the contents of certain secret and unregistered documents which had been left in their rooms during their absence.    The source of the leakage had been revealed on the under-starding that the matter would not be pursuedbeyond the dismissal from the Public  Serviceof the culprit, and, notwithstanding that ithad not been found possible to establish the identity of the intermediary between theculprit and the newspaper, it had been thoughtadvisable to close with this offer in order to discover the source rather than take proceedings in circumstances of great publicity with a riskof never ascertaining the ultimate source ofthe le akage .
The Cabinet offered their congratulations to the Attorney-General on the successful results of his efforts, and agreed  (a) That it was in the interests ofthe Public Service to give as muchpublicity to this incident as thecirctunstanc es permitted, at anyrate within the Service itself,and that this  question should beleft to the Chancellor of theExchequer and the permanent secretary to the Treasury, inconsultation with the Prime Minister:(b) That the Permanent Secretary tothe Treasury should form a small committee of Civil Servants todraw up some principles to guideCabinet Ministers and their&quot;Depart-ments in the handling of secret cabinet documents for purposes ofinformation and record.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,March 24,  1926.
