The Cabinet had &quot;before them the following documents in regard to the Report of the Royal-Commission on the Coal Industry:-A Report by the Prime Minister,as Chairman of the CabinetCommittee (Paper CP.-122 (26)):A Memorandum by the mining association of Great Britain(Paper CP.-123 (26)):A Memorandum by the Secretaryfor Mines on Possible Methodsof applying a diminishing Subsidy(Paper C.P.-121 (26)):..  A Note by the Chancellor of theExchequer covering a treasury memorandum On the Nationalisa-tion of Royalties (Paper G .P.-116 (26)):A Memorandum by the Lord privy seal on the nationalisation of Royalties (Paper CP.-119 (26)).The Prime Minister said that the Meetingof Mineowners and Miners had been postponed untilWednesday afternoon in order to meet the convenience-ence of one of the Miners&apos; representatives who could not be present earlier.Some members of the Cabinet Oon .considered thatthe formula in paragraph 2 of CP.-122 (26) wenttoo far in committing the Government to theprinciple of nationalisation of mineral royalties,and that, notwithstanding that in the formulaagreement in the terms of the Royal CommissionsReport was made, conditional on acceptance by theother parties, nevertheless the Governmentsproposed undertaking wovild always be quoted asacceptance of the principle of purchase of royal-ties .Various proposals were made for improving the formula, including the following:-
Line .5:    Omission of the word &quot;previously&quot;,which met with general acceptance:Line 6:    A proposal, In lieu of the follow-ing words.&quot;Some of the recommendationscontain proposals which theGovernment would not havedesired to advocate but forthe Report&quot;,:to substitute:-&quot;are in some respects contraryto the views held by the Govern-ment,and some of the rscommenda-tiorB contain proposals, moreparticularly those concernedwith mireral royalties, whichthe Government could not ^acceptbut for the sake of an agreed settlement&quot;.4th Line from the end:    A good deal of objec-tion was taken to the words &quot;full effect&quot;, and it was suggested thatthe phrase should either run &quot;togive effect to the recommendations&quot;or, alternatively, to substitute&quot;general effect&quot; for &quot;full effect&quot;.Another proposal was that the Prime minister should frankly admit that there was a difficultyin regard to royalties, but that h9 should make itclear that if the Miners and Mineowners had bothmade great concessions from their own point of viewfor the sake of agreement by accepting the Report,he was prepared to go back to the Cabinet and ask them to.give way on the point.   Against this pointof view it was strongly urged that the government must from the first strike the note of agreement,and that the only chance was to give the other parties a lead in this respect.The general view of the Cabinet was that negotiations must not be allowed to break downthrough any fault on the part of the Government,and the Cabinet agreed  
That the Prime Minister&apos;s Committeeshould meet on the following day tore-examine, in the light of theCabinet&apos;s discussion, the draftformula contained in paragraph 2of their Report (Paper CP.-122 (26))with a viow to further considerationof the question on Wednesday, March24 th.
