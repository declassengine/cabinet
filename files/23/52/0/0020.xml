APPENDIX II.



LETTER TO THE PRIME MINISTER FROM THE MINERS&apos; EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.



30th April, 1926.



Dear Mr. Prime Minister, 



The proposals of the Coal Owners, delivered by messenger this afternoon, (April 30th) have been considered by our Executive Committee, and also by the Conference, which, as you are aware, has been in London since Wednesday, to which we are empowered to send the following reply:



REPLY



The Miners note with regret that although the Report of the Coal Commission was issued on the 6th March, 1926, the Mine-owners have only submitted a proposal for a National Wage Agreement, and a National Uniform Minimum percentage so late as April 30th at 1-15 p.m. when at least two-thirds of the mine-workers in the coal field are already looked out by the coal-owners.

The proposals, stated briefly, provide for a reversion to the minimum percentage of 1921, i.e. 20% on 1914 standard wages, which means a uniform reduction of 13 3rd per cent of the standard wages of the miners, and further is conditional upon the extension of the working day for over three years, such an adjustment to be reviewed after December, 1929.

The reply of the Miners, after considering the proposals in the light of the present situation, is therefore as follows: They are unanimously of the opinion that the proposals cannot be accepted, but on the other hand feel that the statement of proposals submitted (as enclosed) on the Trades Union Congress, affords a reasonable basis

  
of negotiations and settlement.Our views on the que-ation of extended hoursare well-known to you, and it is only necessary to saythat the present hours :(a) are long enough to supply all the coal for which a market can be found;(b) are as long as man should be expected to pursue such a dangerous and arduous calling;    and(c) that to extend hours in present ciroumstance-sis^ simply to swell the ranks of theunemployed;(d) that to increase hours Is to invitesimilar measures on the part of our foreign competitors;(e) that such a proposal is contrary to the findings of the Royal Commission.As to counters-proposals we can only say that we will co-operate to the fullest extent with the Governmentand the Owners in instituting such re-organisation as is recommended by the Commission.Until such re-organisation brings greaterprosperity to the Industry, the Miners should not becalled up?vn to eurrender^&amp;ny -of their present Inadequatewages and conditions.On behalf of the Iviiners&apos; Federation,Yours -faithfully,(Signed)    HERBERT SMITH (PRESIDENT.)&quot; T.  RICHARDS      (VICE-PRESIDENT).n. W.P.  RICHARDSON (TREASURER).&quot; A.J.  COOK (SECRETARY).Be Rt, Hon. Stanley Baldwin, M.P.
(jUBSTIOH PUT BY PHIMjb! MINISTJfit TO UZU PUGH.Pr tday. ,-3 rth. ^prlX* .1986There has been no indication during the discussion&quot;&quot;&quot;that the Minors&apos; Representatives are prepared tonegotiate upon the baeis proposed by the Report sofar as regards wages;    on tho contrary, the Miners&apos;declarations have made it plain that they are unableto aooept any departure from the 19 34 minimum, such asis included in the Commissions recommendations.Will the Trades Union Congress Committeeobtain assurances that, if further time were availablefor negotiation, the Miners&apos; Repreeexitativea would enterinto those negotJLations accep-ting the Commiealon&apos; sreoomjaendartions on this point printed at the top ofp.236 of tho Report.
