1. The Seoretary of State for Foreign Affaire dr&apos;ewattention to the unfortunate controversy which had arisen in the Press of the verious countries on the subject ofthe proposed additions to the Council of the League ofNations., which was doing more harm than good.   He had sent a telegram to several Foreign Ministers suggesting that they should try and get together for an informal discussion with the German representatives before theitish Re- meeting of the Council of the League, in the hope that byMentationthe forth- means of private .discussion, such as had been held atning Meet-I Locarno, agreement might be reached in dealing with this T, COUNCIL10 IB AGUEIeviousbinet 6il ST.jsion o.)k ASSEMBLY.question.    Sir Austen Chamberlain said that his attentionference:binet 32    i had been called by Sir Eric Drumraond to the fact that in ), Con-    fusion 15.) I 1921 it had been proposed that Spain and Brazil should become permanent members of the Council of the League andthat afterwards, when this proposal had been rejected,Lord Balfour had proposed that Spain alone should be addedto the Counoil, that he had argued the case for Spain withgreat   ^(genoy and had almost carried it, the proposalbeing defeated only by the opposition of Brazil.    Thepolicy of supporting Spain, of which the Cabinet hadtaken cognlzanoe on November 11, 1925 (Cabinet 52(25),Conclusion 3), was, therefore, no new policy.The Secretary dsf State for Dominion Affairs said hethought he ought to inform the Cabinet that the high commissioners of the Dominions, who usually did not disoussmatters of foreign policy on which they were unable to speak for their Governments, but most of whom happened torepresent their Governments at the Assembly, had expressed a strong view to him against the addition to the Councilof any country except Germany at the present time, andhad given their opinion that the Assembly as a whole was opposed to the Spalnsh claim.   Mr. Amery also-1-
attention to a telegram of February 18th. in whichthe Government of the Union of South Africa had strongly disapproved the attempt to obtain permanentseats on the Gouncil for Spain and Poland, andpossibly Brazil.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That further discussion of thequestion of representation onthe Council of the League shouldbe postponed until Wednesday, March3rd:(b) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster, and-  (at the discretion of the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs)Sir Cecil Hurst, should be theBritish representatives at theforthcoming Meeting of the Assembly:(c) That  the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should settle withthe Secretary of State for theColonies the arrangements inregard to the provision of expertinformation and assistance inconnection with the presentation to the Council of the League ofthe Iraq Treaty.
m3 OPSUNDANCEjTHE CIVIL5RVICE.sferenoe:cabinet 526), Con-conclusion 1i)(ii) .)2.  The attention of the Cabinet was drawn totheir previous  Conclusion in regard to hours ofattendance in the Civil Service., taken during thediscussion of the Report of the Standing Committeeon Expenditure, which was as follows:-(i) That the minimum hours of attendance of new entrants of that portion ofthe Staff of the Civil Service whichis. at present employed on the basisof a 7-hours day or 42-hours weekshould be extended to 9 hours a day with a half holiday on Saturday ifthe state of public business permits:(ii) That the minimum hours of attendance of existing members in the CivilService should remain as at present.As the above decision had not been discussed at any length, it was treated as provisional, andthe final decision was held over for consideration in connection with the      . question of the Cost-of-Living Bonus in the Civil Service, in regard towhich see Conclusion 5.
3.  The Cabinet had before theirs a Memorandum bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer in regard to a recent decision of the Staff side of the CivilService Whitley Council to appeal to arbitration in respect of the decision of the Government in1921 that the cost-of-living bonus payable onsalaries in excess of  500 should be rre.desubject to a special cut and that no bonus at all should be paid on salaries of  2,000 a year or over, or so as to increase the rate of salaryto&apos; more than  -2,000 a year (Paper C .P.-75 (26) ) .In this Memorandum the Chancellor of the Exchequersuggested the expediency of bringing the matter again before the Rouse of Commons  and informing the House that, whatever might be possible later on,it would not be right to abolish the &quot;super-cut&quot;under existing conditions.    If this statement were accepted by the House of Commons., the proposedarbitration could not take place.After a long discussion, the Cabinet felt thatthe whole question required further exploration,particularly in regard to the precise effect of thepresent Prime Minister&apos;s undertaking in May, 1923:for example, as to whether the Government were orwe.re not bound thereby not only to submit all ques-tions  to arbitration but also to support an arbitration award in Parliament even &quot;though it were contrary tothe. spirit of the Government&apos;s policy and wouldinvolve the taxpayer in heavy liabilities.The Cabinet agreedThat the Chancellor of the exchequer&apos;sMemorandum (Paper CP.-75 (26)) shouldbe referred to a Cabinet committee composed as follows&apos;:-
The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The President of the Board of Education,The Minister of Labour,The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.,The At to rney-General.

February 3, 1926, to(consider the Report of the Imperial EconomicCommittee on Empire Marketing and kindred questions(Paper CP.-60 (26)) .In the course of the discussion, reference was made to a telegram from the Prime Minister ofthe Commonwealth of Australia to the Prime Ministerof Great Britain, dated February 20, 1926.Subject to the reservation of all allusionsin the Report to the question of Research until such time as the views of the Lord President of theCouncil were available, the Cabinet agreed -(I) To approve the Report of the CabinetCommittee (Paper CP.-60 (26)), therecommendations of which (includingcertain modifications introduced bythe Cabinet underlined ) are asfollows:-(a) The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs should be the minister responsible for the expenditureof the Government grant, and that,in this matter, he should act inconjunction with a Committee ofwhich he would be the Chairman.(b) The Secretary of State should be assisted by a Vice-Chairman, who should be either the parliamentary under-Secretary of State for theColonies or the parliamentary under-Secretary of State for DominionAffairs .(c) the  Secretary of State&apos;s Committeeshould be composed as follows:-(i)  Such members as the Secretary ofState may appoint in consultationwith the Chairman of the ImperialEconomic Committee.(. ii) Two members representing english and Scottish Agriculture.(iii)  The Financial Secretary to theTreasury.(d) A Civil Servant should be appointedSecretary to the Secretary of State&apos;sCommittee and Accounting Officer to
!HI3the Vote, and that the details of subordinate staff, which should beas small as possible, should besettled by agreement between theDominions Office and the Treasury.(e) The Secretary of State&apos;s Committeeshould have power to appoint suchSub-Committees as it may consider necessary for carrying out its work,and to appoint thereto suitable persons from outside its own ranks,provided that wherever there is an existing Government Departmentengaged on similar work, action should be taken by the Secretary ofState&apos;s Committee through that Depart-ment.(f) The cost of staff and of work under-taken at additional expense by government Departments and publicinstitutions should be a charge against the Government grant.(g) Arrangements should be made to avoid the necessity for the presentation of Supplementary Estimates by departments undertaking work onbehalf of the Secretary of State&apos;sCommittee.(h) The interests of British agriculturemust be considered in any allocation of the Government grant.(i) The grant for 1926 should be  500,000,and for 1927  1,000,000.(j) It should take the form of a Grant-in-Aid,  provided that if experienceshould show that an abnormally largebalance had accrued, the Governmentwould be allowed to reopen this question.(NOTE.   After considerable discussion on the above recommendation the Chancellor, in view of thegeneral opinion of his colleagues,withdrew the dissent he hadformulated in the CabinetCommittee&apos;s Report.)(k) Arrangements should be made by the. Secretary of State for Dominion affairs with Dominion Governments for theappointment of an additional member to the Imperial Economic Committeeto represent English and ScottishAgriculture .(IT) In regard to conclusion I (o)(ii) above,that the two members of the Secretary ofState&apos;s Committee representing english and Scottish Agriculture should be nominated by the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries and the Secretary forScotland jointly.

m &amp;u?FTtee Bill.,f9renc e:cabinet 3[osion 16.;6.   The Cabinet had before them the memorandum which the Secretary of State for the Colonies had undertaken at the previous Meeting to circulate inregard to the proposed guarantee of a Loan of 4,000,000 for developments, etc., in Palestine(Paper CP.-71 (26)) .Doubt was expressed as to the correctness ofthe view formulated in paragraph 8 of the Secretaryof State&apos;s Memorandum that, in view of Article 18of the Palestine Mandate, it would hot be practicable to attach to  the guarantee of the proposed loan a formal condition that contracts for the developmentof harbour works, etc.,  should be given to Britishand not to foreign firms .The Cabinet adjourned consideration of thisquestion in order that further investigation might bemade by the Secretary of State for the Colonies onthe following points(i) To obtain an Opinion from the LawOfficers as to whether it would be inconsistent with Article 18 of thePalestine Mandate to attach to aBritish guarantee of the proposed loana formal condition that contracts for expenditure incurred out of the loanshould be given to British and not goforeign firms:(ii) In consultation with the Treasury,to consider the question of princeple as to whether loans in respect ofmandated territory could be issuedthrough.the Agents-General in.thesame way as unguaranteed Colonial&apos;loans, .or throuph the machinery adopted- -      by the Treasury in the case of Britishloans:(iii) As to whether the loans to palestine and East Africa could be ino luded ina single Bill, as suggested by theCommittee of Home Affairs (H.A.C.2nd Conclusions (26), Appendix, List(B), 5 and 6).
7. The Prime Minister said that, in connection-with the forthcoming Debate on the Air Estimates,the question was to be raised as to the necessityfor the existence of a separate Air Force.   Hethought it would be very useful if he, as Head ofthe Government, were to precede the discussion onthe Estimates with a statement to the effect thatthe Government had no intention of reopening thisquestion.    This, he considered, was important from,a Parliamentary point of view, because otherwise the impression would pervade the Debate that thequestion was still an open one.    It was also important   in order to end a controversy that had proved detrimental to the Services.The Secretary of State for War said that if thesubject were to be debated in the Cabinet he thoughta good deal might be said on the other side.The Prime Minister said he would consider theterms of his statement the same afternoon and would discuss it with the Ministers at the head of theService Departments.
iff?In, SERVICEBBATIONLouslerence:linet 6Con-&apos;liion 12.)8, The Prime Minister informed his colleagues that,in view of the very strong opposition that had arisenagainst the proposed expenditure on recreation grounds for the Civil Service, he thought the best plan wouldbe to inform the Members of Parliament -ho had raised the agitation, as well as the Sports Committee of theCivil Service, that the Government proposed to putdown  10,000 in the Votes of the present year as an earnest of their intention to carry their pledges inthe matter, and to add that the scheme v/ould be com-pleted in not less than four and not more than tenyears .The suggestion was made that steps should betaken to ascertain how this proposal would beaccepted .The subject was adjourned untilFriday next.
9, The Secretary of Stats for Dominion affairs asked th^ Cabinet to consider the appointment of an agenda Committee in connection with the forthcoming imperial Conference, on the precedent of previousConferenc as .The subject was adjourned untilthe Meeting of the Cabinet to beheld on Friday next.
