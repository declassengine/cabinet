RE-ELECTION 2.    The attention of the Cabinet was drawn   asOP MINISTERS .a matter of -urgency, to a Private Bill entitled&quot;The Re-election of Ministers Act (1919) amendment bill, 1926&quot;   to be introduced in the House ofCommons on February 12th.The Cabinet were reminded that a proposal tothe sarre effect had been inoluded in a Bill intro-duced by the late Prime Minister, The Right Hon. A.Bonar Law, but had been dropped owing to opposition.In favour of the Bill it was pointed out thatthe present position involved special hardships,first,  from the fact that the necessity for seekingre-election only applied to certain offices and notto others, and that when applied it involved heavymoney penalties?    further, that a Member of Parlia-ment who was otherwise highly qualified for officemight sometimes be passed over because his seat was a precarious one.For these and other reasons there was generalagreement that the present state of the law was ananachronism and inconvenient, and bore with speoialhardship on the younger Members of Parliament,The Cabinet agreed - That the Prime Minister should state   -the arguments in favour of the bill as strongly as possible in the Houseof Commons, in order to provide an indication that in voting for the BillMembers would not be acting in opposi-tion to the Government&apos;s wishes,butthat the question should be left to a free vote of the House of commons and the Government Whips should notbe put on.

Theeffect of this postponement was to reduce theestimated contribution to be made by the exchequer this year to approximately  650,000, the figure which the Chancellor of the Exchequer had originally contemplated.As regards future years, Sir James Craig was unwilling to agree to the insertion in the agreementof an over-riding maximum for the contributiondesired, but     had     given        the Chare ellor, for publication, a letter agreeing that if in any year the contribution exceeded  1,000,000 the ImperialGovernment should be free, without breach of agree-ment, to reopen the question on its merits.The Cabinet agreed  * To approve the Agreement embodied in the Schedule to the draft bill attached to Paper CP.-47 (26).
