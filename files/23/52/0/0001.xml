PARLIAMENTARYARRANGEMENTS.The King&apos;sSpeech.government policy.(previous reference:Cabinet 59(25), Con-elusion 7.)[employmentasurance.ev ionsference:cabinet 545), Oon-conclusion 4,)1&apos; The Cabinet had before them the following documents in regard to Government Policy, withspecial reference to the King&apos;s Speech on theOpening of Parliament:-A draft of the K1ng?s Speech,prepared in the Cabinet Secre-tariat on the basis of materialfurnished by the Departments(Paper C .P.-9 (26)):A Memorandum by the Minister ofHealth on the provisional pro-gramme of legislation for his department (Paper CP.-536 (25)):A Memorandum by the President ofthe Eoard of Trade containing theprovisional programme of legisla-tion for his Department (paper.P.-6 (26)):A Memorandum by the Secretary forScotland containing the provisional programme of Scottish legislation for 19D6 (Paper C.P.-12 (26)):A Memorandum by the Home secretary in regard to Rome Office Bills for1926  fpaper CP.-13 (.26)).The Cabinet were reminded that legislationbecomemight       necessary after the Report of the coal for this reasonCommission had been received, and/^also   bearing inmind the congestion of business which had resultedin the previous  summer),  it was very important notto overload the King&apos;&apos;3 Speech on the present occasion.The Cabinet were also reminded that they hadreceived no information as to the nature of thelegislation contemplated in regard to slum preventionbeforeand rural housing, and it was suggested thatythesesubjects were included in the King&apos;s Speech thematter should be further explored (See pon^uslnn 2),.^The Minister of Labour said that it would benecessary to make some reference to UnemploymentInsurance, &quot;since the payment of benefits would cease im June under the existing legislation, and
LeaseholdEnfranchise-ment.the Prime Minister invited him to send a Note oh.the subject.The suggestion was also made that some refer-ence should be made to leasehold enfranchisement.The view was expressed, however^ that before any-public hopes were excited on this subject, either bymention in the Kingfs Speech or even by promise of apublic Inquiry,  th-3 Cabinet should conduct its ownInquiry with a view to ascertaining what prospectsthere were of pursuing the matter successfully.The Prime Minister undertook to considerthe expediency of a Cabinet Committee on leaseholdenfranchis er-ent.The Cabinet agreed -(a) That the Prime Minister should confer with the acting Chief Whip and other ministers concerned, and that in the meanwhile the preparation of a furtherdraft of the King&apos;s Speech should beleft in his hands&apos;(b) That as the Prime Minister had politicalengagements in the country on Wednesday,January 27th, a Meeting of the Cabinetshoujd be held on FRIDAY, JANUARY 29th,for further consideration of the Eing&apos;sSpeech.
8. Arising out of the discussion referred toin the previous Conclusion, the Minister of Healthgave the Cabinet a preliminary sketch, of his pro-posals in regard to slum prevention and rural housing.The Cabinet agreed -(a) That the Minister of Health should circulate a Memorandum to theCabinet in regard to his proposalsfor dealing with slum areas and rural housing:(b) That the subject of slum prevention and rural housing should be considered in the first instance by a CabinetCommittee composed as followsThe Lord Privy Seal (in the Chair),The Lord Chancellor,The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Minister of Health,The Minister of Agriculture &amp; Fisheries,The Secretary for Scotland.
37 The Secretary of State for India informed theCabinet that after examining the cases of the Irishprisoners he found himself substantially., and subjectto certain vinor exceptions, in agreement with theviews of the Home Office.    The oases of 37 prisoners,in .all ware under review. - He agreed with the HomeOffice that in the case of 27 an immediate dischargewas desirable.    In 3 cases the Home Office consideredthat conduct marks should be restored,.so as to enablethe prisoners to be released at an early date, buton the whole he himself was inclined to release them at once.   Three of the prisoners had. been concerned inthe Derry prison-breaking case, in which two wardershad been killed by chloroform; their ease was. on adifferent footing altogether from those-of thepolitical prisoners, and his recommendation would bethat the Government of Northern Ireland should beasked to review these cases in five years&apos; time.-There were 4 other cases in which he proposed torecommend Immediate release (The Cabinet agreed -(a) To leave full discretion to theSecretary of State for India, whowould take his decision after con-suiting the Home Office:(b) That the Secretary of State for india should ths same, after no on give theSecretary of State for DominionAffairs material for a telegram which he could send to the FreeState Government on the subject.
-...  84.   The Cabinet had before them a Note by theChancellor of the Exchequer covering a treasury memorandum giving a general survey and full- parti-circulars in regard to the negotiationsfor the funding of the Italian Debt (Paper C.F.-10(26)) .The Chancellor of the Exchequer gave theCabinet a summary of the negotiations with Count Volpiand the Italian Delegation up to the present time.The amount of the sun) owed by Italy was  592,000, OOCg^Against this had to be set a gold deposit amountingto  22,000,000 and various credits of a total of   .approximately,  30,000,000.   ffi^e-^(^*a*--a*- B    ,   ^-rUttwM- tyy *h TO fv^wc JUfy^lW, ffvv. ft 3tm* d^W3*\.  SSyfl       Q&apos;(DiBQi^fotf^e&apos;1^principal of  592,000,000, but in discussing proposalsfor a settlement on a basis pari passu with the Americarsettlement the Italians kept urging that the interestowed by Great Britain to Italy on this sum (say, 2,500,000)  ought to count towards the annual payments by Italy.    This &quot;argument was not really defensible,but if the negotiations broke down it might be usedeffectively in Italy,    The Italians had made a tentativeoffer to pay  1,250,000 per annum from 1926 to 1930,and, after that year,  to pay  2,000,000 per annumbased on the credit of Italy and  2,000,000 from theItalian share of the Dawss Scheme, which they calleda payment of  4,000,000 per annum.    This was a gooddeal more than had been expected in the past, andwould probably have been accepted with alacrity twoor three years ago, but was not by any means psri passuwith the American settlement.   After reading to theCabinet a number of arguments which the ItalianDelegation had asked him to lay before them, urginga settlement favourable to Italy, and after exposingthe weakness of these arguments, the Chancellor of the
Exchequer outlined four alternative scales whichhad been proposed by the Treasury.    Of these theonly two which he thought had any chance of accept-anc e were;-A scheme for the payment of  4,000,000per annum from 19S6 onwards over thewhole period of payments,  2,000,000of which woiild be guaranteed on the credit of Italy and  2,000,000 a first charge on Italian receipts on accountof reparation;andA scheme by which Italy would pay 1,000,000 in 1926,  2,000,000 in1927,  3,000,000 in 1928,  4,000,000in 1929, and  5,000,000 thereafter, ofwhich  2,000,000 a year would be dependant on Italian reparationreceipts .The Permanent Und^-Secretary of State forForeign Affairs informed the Cabinet that he hadreceived a message from the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to the effect that Sir austen chamberlain hoped, from a political point of view, than settlement, would be reached.    Sir William Tyrrellsaid that this was particularly important from thepoint of vie&apos;&quot; of our policy in the Near East,    It was largely due to the Italians that the settlement ofthe dispute in regard to the boundary.between egypt and Tripoli had not rendered us unpopular in Egypt.As regards the Mosul dispute,  it was most important to preserve Anglo-Franco-Italian solidarity..
The general feeling in the Cabinet was thatit was very important to take the present opportunityto bring about a settlement.   The view was expressed that payments in the early years were more important than larger payments in the distant-future;    thatthe settlement should not be one which could becontrasted/unfavourably with the American Battlement;and that, rather than enter on a settlement to whichthe foregoing criticism could bs applied, it would beItalian-advisable to provide, as in the/American agreement,for large sums being paid in later years of theperiod of payment, notwithstanding that in all probability these large payments would never be made.The Cabinet agreed  That the Chancellor of the Exohequershould be given a free hand to makethe best settlement he could, on thegeneral lines he had indicated to theCabinet.7-
5. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe President of the Board of. Trade giving reasonsin favour of granting an application from MessrsVickers for a licence for the supply to SovietRussia of small coast defence vessels and submarinemines stated to be required purely for defensive purposes (Paper C.P.-3 (26)).The Prime Minister read to the Cabinet aletter received by the Secretary (in the absence ofthe Secretary of State for War) from the War Officedrawing attention to the coincidence that Turkey waswas obtaining twelve coastal motor-boats and wasfitting them with wireless sets;    pointing out alsothat Vickera had recently applied for horns anddetonators for submarine mines for Turkey, an appli-cation which they understood had been refused by theAdmiralty,   The War Office thought it possible thatthe boats and mines referred to in C.P,-3 (.26) would eventually find their way to Turkey,   As MessrsVickers &apos;  letter did not specify the nature of thesmall coast defence vessels in question, the WarOffice suggested that it might he worth while lookinginto the design of thevessels and the mines, unlessthe Admiralty were already satisfied on the point.The Cabinet agreed -(a) That the decision of November 12, 1924,to the effect that it would be inconsist-ent with the attitude towards Russiataken&quot; up by members of the present government during the, General election to sanction the equipment of SovietRussia with arms and ammunition ofBritish manufacture (Cabinet 59 (24),Conclusion 10) should be re-r-considered as regards cases where the war material was of a purely defensive character:(b) That the Secretary should place himself in communication with the three service departments with a view to a Joint Reportbeing furnished, before the next Meeting .of the Cabinet,  in regard to the warmaterial referred to in C.P.-3 (26).
InternationalEc oflomicConference.preparatory committee,6. The Cabinet had before them a letter addressed by the Foreign Office to the Secretary to the Cabinetasking that, as in the case of the Committee of theCouncil of the League of Nations on Disarmament, aBritish Minister should be appointed as representative on the^^as^teas^^sgasrii^^ the proposed international Economic Conference (Paper C,Po-8 (26)).The Cabinet were reminded that the BritishGovernment had always been opposed to the holding ofthe International Economic Conference;    that whenthey were unable to resist it their intention hadbeen that, the eventual Economic Conference should beon lines similar to the Brussels Conference and shouldbe attended by experts only and not by Ministers;    andthat in these circumstances it appeared inadvisablethat we should be represented by a Minister on thePs-e^pa-r^feo-yy Committee.The Cabinet agreed  To adjourn this question until thereturn of the Secretary of State forForeign. Affairs.
AQ.    &apos;ntton oftionalishalion.riousrence:net 60, Con-ion 8(h) .)7 -  The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Air proposing that aBritish Battalion, which had been retained temporarily in Iraq during the recent crisis over Mosul on the arrival of a Battalion from India to relieve it,should now be permitted to leave Iraq.    It was statedin the Memorandum that the whole War Office troopingprogramme was held up in the absence of such a decision,,and that the General Staff had been consulted by theAir Staff on the question and had expressed their concurrence (Paper C0P.-15 (26)).Some doubts were expressed as to whether,  solong as there wa3 a considerable element of danger in the situation, it was desirable to withdraw theBritish Battalion, since this constituted half of theBritish Infantry force now in Iraq.The Cabinet were informed, however, that if theEattalion was not withdrawn by April it would beimpossible to withdraw it before the autumn, and thatan increase of  175,000 to the Middle East Estimateswould be involved if the Battalion were not withdrawn. .The Cabinet agreed  (a) That, on the understanding that some weeks must alapse before the Battalioncould actually leave Iraq, preparations should be made on the assumption thatthe Battalion would be withdrawn:(b) That the subject should be consideredby the  Committee of Imperial Defence attheir next Meeting.
8.    The President of the Board of Trade informed the Cabinet that at present he saw no signs of asettlement of the wireless operators&apos;  strike.   Upto the present time 887 ships (including some morethan once) had cleared from fhis country withoutoperators, of which 71 were passenger ships.    In theprevious week 204- ships had cleared, of which 109were putting to sea for the first time withoutwireless operators.   He felt that this situation could not be prolonged without some action beingtaken by the Government to force a settlement.The Minister of Labour stated that the WirelessCompanies had made certain proposals to the shipownerswith a view to reaching agreement with them beforeapproaching the men on strike.   These proposals hadbeen sent to the shipowners on January 2nd, but as yet no reply had been received.    A conference was to takeplace between the Wireless Companies and the Shipownerson the following day, and he was hopeful of some agreement, though it might be necessary to put somepressure upon the shipowners.   In the last resort isaCourt, but he would first like to see the result ofthe conference.The Cabinet left the question to theMinister of Labour and the Presidentof the Board of Trade,
SEVERNBARRAGE.(previous reference: .Cabinet&apos; 45(25), Con-clusion 4.)9. The Cabinet had before them an extract from theMinutes of the 16th Meeting of the Committee of civil research, containing recommendations for continuing the preliminary work of investigation in connectionwith the Severn Barrage f Paper CP.-4 (26)).The Cabinet took note of, and approved,  therecommendations of the Committee, which are as follows&quot;The Committee approved generally the Reportof the Severn Barrage Sub-Committee &apos;C.R.(K)45)and agreed:-(a) That a prima facie case had beenestablished for the further expend-iture of public money on *he prose-cution of the enquiry:(b) That the Ministry of Transport shouldbe the Department on whose vote theexpenses involved in the first stage of the enquiry should be charged:(c) That the following provision shouldbe made for the cost of the first part of the investigation:-(l) An Appropriation-in-Aid of NavyVotes in recoupment of the costof marine survey by the HydrographicDepartment.
