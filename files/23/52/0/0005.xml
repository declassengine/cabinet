Lord PI toner has expressed strong objections:    and to invite theSecretary of State for the colonies to put the strongest pressure on theHigh Commissioner of Palestine to achieve this economy, and   in so doing,to inform Lord Plumer of the strong feeling of the  Cabinet that, at a timewhen Palestine has a surplus in itsBudget and Great Britain has a deficit,this mandated territory ought to acceptthe transfer of financial burdens nowproposed   more particularly as, from apolitical point of view,  it is mostimportant to reduce the Middle EastVote:(e) Travelling Expenses:To reject the proposal that theExchequer should in no case pay more than third-class fares fortravelling expenses, as the effectof this proposal would be to discrim-inate against Members of Parliamentlacking the means to pay the differ-ence between third and first-classfare, would be criticised as classlegislation, and was open to many other objections:(f) Reduction of Staff:To authorise the immediate circulation to Departments of a Treasury Circularon the lines of the draft containedto i v6p8??g&amp; fj Jie0dIciIlon2xAMl?dDliew:(g) Hours of Attendance in the Civil Service:(i) That the minimum hours of attendance of new entrants of that portion of thestaff of the Civil Service which is atpresent employed on the basis of a7-hours day or 42-hours week, should beextended to 8 hours a day with a half-holiday on Saturday if the state ofpublic business permits:(ii) That the minimum hours of attendance of existing members in the Civil service should remain as at present:( h)  Educ at ion:To take note that the reductions inthe provisional Estimate of the education department are under consideration bythe Colwyn Committee:(i) National Health Insurance   Recovery of cost of Central Administration in addition^to Audit and Valuation (.2700.000):To take note that this proposal isfound to be impracticable, but thatthe possibility of some economiesunder this heading are still under con-sider ation:
(i)) To take note that., as the resultof a discussion by the Committee ofImperial Defence the same morningon the recommendations of the ColwynCommittee on the subject of the NavalOil Fuel Reserve, the Admiralty Esti-mate will be reduced to  58 100,000(as compared with  57,500,000 proposedby the Colwyn Committee) and that thetotal economies will amount to  6.,.100.,.000instead of  6,7 00,000 as stated in theReport of the Standing Committee onExpend iture:(ii)  That a passage in regard to the&quot;shadow cut&quot; should be included in theforthcoming Navy Estimates similar tothe passage in the statement accompany-ing last year&apos;s Navy Estimates, whichwas as follows:-&quot;As in the Estimates for 1924-25, aspecial overhead deduction has, bydecision of H.M, Government, beenmade on the provision for contractwork in Votes 8, 9 and 10, to discountIn advance possible delays in theprogress of such work.   This reduc-tion of the money provision is not intended to affect the normal pro-gress of the services to which it applies, and if the delays do notIn fact occur, Parliament will indue course be invited to make good the deficiency to such extent asmay be necessary.&quot;(k) Empire Marketing:That, in view of the paramount import-ance of fulfilling the pledges givento the Dominions, it is necessary tomake provision in the Estimates forsome substantial expenditure in connec-tion with the Empire Marketing Scheme,but that it is improbable that theultimate figure of  1,000,000 could bewisely spent in the first year of theScheme.The fixing of the exact figure was left to the Chancellor of the exchequer in consultation with the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs.The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs was authorised to inform theDominions of the Governments intentions in this matter.
