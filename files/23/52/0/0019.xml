Thepresent position was that the Mineowners had at last agreed to enter an unfettered confer-ence with the Miners, with the Prime minister as Chairman.    The negotiations were continuing,and it was&apos; possible that he might find it neces-&apos;sary to ask the Cabinet for decisions on the morrow.The Cabinet agreed  To hold themselves in readiness for a Meeting, if required, onThursday, April 29th, at 10 a.m.or some similar early hour.-8-

The Cabinet had before them telegrams nos.148 and 149, of the 21st April, 1926, from lord lloyd, in Cairo, circulated by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs, on the subject of the &apos;Sirdarship of the Egyptian Army.Inview of the absence,  through indisposi-tion, of the Secretary of State for War, theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreedto postpone the question for the moment.   Heemphasized, however, that it was impossible to delay the decision for long, as the approachingelections were likely to result in a Zagloulistmajority and it was important to settle the ques-tion of the Sirdarship while Ziwar Pasha was stillPrime Minister.    He was consulting Lord Lloyd asto how long a decision could be postponed.The Cabinet agreed  To postpone the question for afew days.

Keferring to recent telegrams from theBritish Ambassador at Angora (e.g., No.2 of the21st April, No.3 and No.4 of the 22nd April),the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention to a remarkable change of attitude onthe part of the Turks, who had now abandonedany desire for an accession of territory atthe expense of Iraq and had made alternative proposals, the most important of which was that turkey should be allotted some participation in Iraq oil.. The Secretary of State also drew attention to his own telegram No .6 of the 24thApril to the British Ambassador, in which hehad notified the intention of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to do their utmost to respond to thenew spirit of conciliation shown by the TurkishGovernment and had indicated that he inclined to secure for Turkey participation in royalties,since this Involved the consent only of thethree Governments immediately conoerned, whereasany attempt to re-distribute the share interestmust involve prolonged and difficult negotiationswith French and American as well as Britishprivate interests, which had only recently beenreconciled.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve in principle the line taken by the Secretary of state in his telegram No.6, of the 24thApril, to Sir Ronald Lindsay:(b) That, in view of the importanceof reaching a solution as soon aspossible, the Cabinet Committee on .Policy, in Iraq, presided over bythe Lord Privy Seal, should bere-assembled as soon as theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs is ready, and that itshould, have authority to approve
the necessary instructions for putting into execution the policyof securing a settlement with turkey on the lines indicated above:(c ) That the Secretary of State forthe Colonies should supplement the telegram he had already sent to the High Commissioner inIraq by a further telegramimpressing on him the urgency ofthe question and pointing outthat the solution of the questionsput to the High commissioner should be as simple as possible.
