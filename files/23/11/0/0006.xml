The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidPopulation at        that a question had arisen as to whether the British Governmentrc    g . should supply, after our evacuation, flour to the civil populationat Archangel sufficient to last them through the winter months.The position at the moment was that 3,700 tons of flour was being sent immediately to cover the period up to the date of evacuationat the end of October. A further 120,000 would have to be sentat the same time if the civil population was to be provisionedthroughout the winter. His Majesty&apos;s Government would have toQ be prepared to bear the initial cost of this undertaking, but would eventually recover half the cost from France.f214] B
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he felt verystrongdy about pouring money in this way into the Russian sieve.The French guarantee of meeting half the cost was worth littleat the present moment. If the flour had to come from the UnitedStates it would mean payment by this Government in dollars. That the British should do this without assistance from the americans was most undesirable. He would like to add that he doubted if we could go through this autumn without a break inthe dollar exchange, and he had already begged the Food controller to buy as little as possible from North America.The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said thatall that the Chancellor of the Exchequer had said was true, butthe British were implicated in the Archangel undertaking, andthe clouds had darkened in that quarter. Our evacuation wouldnot take place in the advantageous circumstances anticipated, andwe should retreat leaving misfortune behind us. We must con-sider what such a retreat would mean. The population was dependent on us for subsistence, and the Government was sup-ported solely because it was known the British were behind it. Inhis opinion, if the British left Archangel without taking suffi-cient measures for the provisioning of the population during thewinter we should be overwhelmed with as much discredit as theFrench were in South Russia.Mr. Bonar Law said that we might endeavour to get the americans to bear a share of the cost of this flour, or we might take no steps at all, which might mean handing over the popula-tion to the Bolsheviks.The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought that the UnitedStates might bear the whole of the expense of supplying flour tothe population in North Russia during the winter, as the BritishGovernment had kept the population going up to the present time.The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said thatthe Americans had never shown any interest in the North Russianexpedition, and he doubted whether we should succeed in gettingthem to bear the whole cost.The War Cabinet decided that The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in con-sultation with the. Treasury, the Food&apos; Controller, and. the Shipping Controller, should examine the question of supplying.....the civil population in North Russia withflour during the winter months, and after such consulta-tion should report to the War Cabinet.Internal  Situation ^- President of the Board of Education  said  that,in Russia. according to the telegrams which  had lately come to hand, itappeared as if the internal situation in Russia was undergoinga change, and that the Bolshevist Government was, losing some ofits most objectionable features. He thought if the Foreign office could prepare an appreciation of the internal situation in Russiait would be most useful.The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said thatit was true that a certain amount of information suggesting thata change was coming over the Bolshevist Government had beenreceived, but side by side with this information there were reportsof the appalling effects of Bolshevist rule in the Baltic Provinces.It was possible to view the Bolshevist spectre from two. verysharply contrasted aspects.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said this was true also of admiral Kolchak&apos;s Government. Pie had read with indignationthe reports in the telegrams of the unsatisfactory treatment ofBritish-trained troops in Admiral Kolchak&apos;s force.The President of the Board of Education said that he had seen an officer, lately returned to this country, who had been on
3WC 592      3 0Admiral Kolchak&apos;s staff. This officer had reported that theatrocities committed by Admiral Kolchak&apos;s force had alienatedthe whole of the Siberian peasantry. The British force had beenpopular at first, but, owing to the behaviour of Kolchak&apos;s force,it had now become unpopular. This officer had informed him that admiral Kolchak himself was an estimable officer, but he wassurrounded by a bad&apos; entourage.The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs undertook to prepare a memorandum on the internal situation inRussia for the consideration of the War Cabinet,Perseus in Govern- 3. With reference to War Cabinet 589, Minute 5, the Warment Service not Cabinet had before them the following decision of the home of   British   or Affairs Committee regarding persons in Government service notAllied Parentage. 0f British or Allied parentage: The Committee recommend that persons not of british or Allied parentage who have been retained in the service ofthe Government throughout the War should not be dismissedbecause of their alien parentage.&quot;Mr. Bonar Law said that he agreed with the decision arrivedat by the Home Affairs Committee on this subject, but he fearedit would be unpopular in the House of Commons.   The decision. would affect some 2,000 persons.   There were three courses opento the Government: (1.) To state to-day in the House of Commons that theGovernment had not had sufficient time to consider theHome Affairs Committee&apos;s recommendations.(2.) To invite six Members of the House of Commons to con-suit with the Government on the subject.(3.) To state that the Government did not propose to dismissany aliens now employed in the Government service.The President of the Board of Education said that he feltmost strongly that the tnird course suggested by Mr. Bonar law should be taken. These men had served the Government duringthe War, and there were no allegations regarding their loyaltymade against them, and it was now suggested that the Govern-ment should break their contract with these individuals. If theGovernment thought them untrustworthy it should have dismissedthem at the beginning of the War, but he could not be a party totheir proposed dismissal at the present time in response to Parlia-mentary clamour.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he agreed withthe President of the Board of Education. He did not mind whatrules were made for the future as regards entering the Govern-ment service, but. he was strongly averse from dismissing thesemen, who had served us during the War, and some of whom had fought for us.Lord Curzon and Lord Milner concurred.Sir Eric Geddes said that, although he agreed that it wouldbe undesirable to dismiss these aliens, he doubted whether theGovernment would be breaking a contract in doing so. He was of opinion, however, that the rules applicable to future admission to the Civil Service were very severe; in fact, the test appliedwas higher than that required of midshipmen entering the Navy.The President of the Board of Trade said that he stilladhered to the protest he had made to the decision of the HomeAffairs Committee on this subject. If it was decided to continueto employ these aliens he doubted the advisability of adopting theGovernment&apos;s new rule regarding future entrants.
The War Cabinet decided that Subject to the approval of the Prime Minister, it should be stated in the House of Commons that the Governmenthad decided that persons not of British or Alliedparentage, who had been retained in the service of theGovernment throughout the War, should not be dismissedbecause of their alien parentage.Unalienated Lands 4. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thein Southern Eho- Secretary of State for the Colonies respecting the ownership ofdesia. the unalienated lands in Southern Rhodesia (Paper G.T.-7540).The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that this was acase of considerable importance. When it came before the JudicialCommittee of the Privy Council, the right of the British SouthAfrican Company to the ownership of the lands was challenged.The Judicial Committee decided that the British South AfricanCompany were not the owners, but that they were entitled to dis-pose of the unalienated land in due course of administration, andto apply the moneys or revenue derived therefrom in reimburse-ment of proper outlays on administration in the current or in pastyears, but that if the Company5s administration came to an end,they had still the right to be reimbursed for any outstandingbalance of administration expenditure. It was then necessary tofind out the amount of such expenditure not yet recovered at a given date.The British South Africa Company created Rhodesia, whichhad now a white population of between 30,000 and 40,000. Thecountry had been built up by the Company, and had a great future.At present it was practically self-supporting; this was the resultof thirty years&apos; work, during the earlier years of which theCompany received little revenue. The shareholders had neverreceived any dividends at all, but had gone on governing the terri -tory. Although its administration had been criticised, it comparec!.not unfavourably, in his opinion, with that of any of the crown colonies, but the time was coming when the present system ofgovernment could not be continued. The white population in southern Rhodesia was of a high order, and quite fitted to be a. self-governing colony, though it was possible that it might wish to annex itself to the Union of South Africa. The white populationwas now kicking against the administration of the Company.Doubtless the desire for union with South Africa would have been more strongly expressed had it not been for the Hertzog movement;but whether the white population decided on this course or onself-government, there was always the question of the payment ofthis expenditure blocking the way to a settlement.. The decisionof the Privy Council practically said that the Company was entitled to be reimbursed for its expenditure in the past. IfRhodesia joined with the Union, the latter would probably be willing to shoulder the debt. In any case it was necessary to ascer-tain the amount of this debt, and he was proceeding to constitute a Commission to go into this question. The appointment of this commission was in contemplation when he went to the ColonialOffice, - and he had succeeded in obtaining the services of thefollowing gentlemen: Lord Cave,   &apos;Lord Chalmers,Sir William Peat,who were ready to begin work almost immediately. He hoped the Commission would report in three or four months&apos; time on theamount the Company was entitled to. When that figure hadbeen established the method by which the  Company should be
reimbursed had to be determined. The decision of the JudicialCommittee on this point was not clear. They contended thatthe Company should be reimbursed, but it was open to questionwhether this should be done gradually as the land was sold,or whether at once in a lump sum as soon as the Company&apos;administration ceased. As long as this question remainedunsettled Rhodesia would be in the dark regarding its future.Lord Milner said that his view was that, when the Companyceased to administer Rhodesia, it should be entitled to be paid bysomebody. That they should be left to recompense themselves bythe sale of land, which process might go on for a hundred years,was, in his opinion, impracticable. No one would take over thegovernment of a country on these terms. He wanted a definitefigure for compensation settled, and the obligation to the Companydefined.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that General smuts had been to see him on this question, and General Smuts&apos; idea was that South Africa should negotiate with Rhodesia, after having received an assurance from the British Government thatit would shoulder any liability connected with the compensation to the Company. He had suggested that, of the 18,000,0-OOZ. whichSouth Africa owed us for war expenses, 10,000,OOOZ., or whateversum was necessary to recompense the Company, should be remittedby the British Government. There was a further question whichhe thought should be referred to the Law Officers of the Crownfor their opinion, and that was, whether the Company was entitled to interest, either simple or compound, on their claim. Ifthe Law Officers said that interest was not payable, the Commis-sion should not have this question included in their terms ofreference.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that his reference to the Commission already covered this point, and ifit was excluded an awkward position would arise, as the termsof reference had been agreed with the British South AfricaCompany.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he did not thinksuch a question should be decided by the Commission, even if itincluded an eminent judge among its members.Mr. Bonar Law said that he thought that a bad impressionwould be created in the House of Commons if the opinion of theLaw Officers was not obtained on this point. In fact, a promisehad been given to the House of Commons that no agreement such,as that contemplated by the Secretary of State for the colonies would be made without the House of Commons being consulted.The War Cabinet decided that The Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies should consult on the question of com-pensation due to the British. South. African Company,after which the matter should again be brought beforethe War Cabinet.5. With reference to War Cabinet 591, Minute 9, the WarCabinet had under consideration a memorandum by the Presidentof the Board of Trade (Paper G.T.-7685) on the Prevention ofProfiteering, covering the heads of a Bill for that purpose. Itwas proposed in the memorandum: (1.) That small tribunals should be set up in all urban and rural districts to receive complaints about excessivecharges made by retailers, with power to revise thecharges made and to impose penalties in bad cases, theparties complained of having a right of appeal, subjectto certain conditions, to a central tribunal.[214] C
(2.) That the Board of Trade should conduct investigationsinto such high prices as were due to causes other thanretailers&apos; profits, and should have power to compelevidence and to enquire into the costs of production.^3.) That, following on such investigation, the Board ofTrade should have power to take appropriate action by fixing prices, by prohibiting dealings withoutlicence, or by fixing margins of profit.The President of the Board of Trade stated that the Boardof Trade were much exercised as to the best way in which tocontrol profiteering in articles other than those which weredefinitely under Government control. They had not been able to discover any satisfactory solution, but thought that the least objectionable course would be to set up the small local tribunalsreferred to in the memorandum. He did not like the proposal,but the only alternative was full control of supplies by the Govern-ment. He was not sure that the proposals, if carried out, wouldhave the direct effect of keeping down prices, but believed thatretailers would be so alarmed that prices would tend to comedown. On the other hand, it was necessary to investigateprofiteering in all stages of production and distribution, from the manufacturer to the consumer. While the tribunals referred to would deal only with the retailer, it would be necessary to appointad hoc tribunals for investigating conditions and prices in theearlier stages, as had been proposed by Mr. McOurdy&apos;s Committeeon Trusts.The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Food saidthat, as the result of his experience in the Committee on Trusts,he thought it desirable to have some central body, such as theBoard of Trade, charged with the duty of constantly investigatingcosts of production and prices, in order to ascertain whether infact there was profiteering. The Government would then be ableto consider the appropriate remedies. The facts as actually ascer-tained should be made public. For example, if investigation weremade in the woollen trade, it might be found that there was noprofiteering, and public unrest would be allayed by the publica-tion of the true facts. On the other hand, if it were found thatexcessive profits were being made by middlemen, the appropriateremedy would be to prohibit dealings in wool except under licence.It was the view of the Ministry of Food that it was essential toappoint a central body to which the public could make complaints,and to provide for their prompt investigation. He felt that theproposal to appoint local tribunals would lead to great difficulty.The tribunals would be composed of local men, who would not bein a position to undertake the scientific investigation of costs ofproduction in various trades.The Minister of Munitions said that the high level of prices at present prevailing was largely, if not wholly, due to the opera-tion of the laws of supply and demand. Wages had increased by107 per cent., the. cost of machinery by 300 per cent., and the costof repairs by even more. The cost of production of materials wasonly one-third of the cost of the finished article. Only one-thirdof the manufacturing machinery of Europe was at work, theremainder being idle. There was certain to be an increasinglyheavy demand for textiles unless export was prohibited. Therewas an abundance of wool in this country, but owing to difficultiesof transport it was impossible to get it moved to the wool-manu-facturing districts. Arrangements were being made to shift it bymotor lorries and coasting steamers, but the effect would not be felt for some time.The President of the Board of Trade said that the considerations mentioned by Lord Inverforth had no relation tothe proposal to appoint local tribunals. The only question suchtribunals would have to consider was whether a retailer, having
paid a given price for his stock, was selling it to the consumer ata price which gave him a reasonable profit and no more.The Food Controller asked whether there was any standardof reasonableness to which the tribunals could work. TheMinistry of Food had suggested setting up a Central StatisticalDepartment which would provide a standard of prices. Hesuggested that the costings department of the Ministry of food should be transferred to the Board of Trade, and expanded into a central Statistical Department. Appreciating the growingagitation against profiteering, he was loth only to offer destructivecriticism, but he felt that the local tribunals would not be satisfactory. Different rulings would be given in differentlocalities. The tribunals would have no technical knowledge, no information on which to base their decisions, and no standard to guide them. As a result, their decisions would be capricious, andwould give rise to considerable agitation. It was essential to havea central authority to investigate prices. On the other hand, hewas in. agreement with Lord Inverforth that there werefundamental causes for the rise in prices which could not be altered.Lord Curzon suggested that a larger unit for the tribunalsthan urban or rural district councils would be desirable. he agreed with the Minister of Food that great difficulty would arise from discrepancies in the findings of tribunals all over thecountry, and therefore suggested that their number should belimited by making the unit of jurisdiction as large as possible.He was of opinion that something of the kind was required, and wished to give satisfaction to the people who thought they werebeing injured, tie desired to set up an authority to whichcomplaints could go quickly for decision.Mr. Bonar Law feared the tribunals would be overwhelmedwith work from the beginning. Everybody would wish to appeal tothem, and in consequence the work would be so congested that theywould give no satisfaction. The Prime Minister had sent him a message to the effect that, in his opinion, the public would not agree to- the proposal that the retailer should be penalised unlessthe same treatment was accorded to the wholesale dealer.The President of the Board of Trade interposed thatprovisions applicable to the wholesale dealer could easily be worked into the scheme. -Mr. Bonar Law continued that the Labour Party were taking up the line in the House of Commons that a Committee of enquiry should be appointed, and he felt that the proposed Bill would giverise to such universal criticism that it would be impossible to passit through the PTouse of Commons. He suggested that a Committeeof Enquiry should be set up to examine the steps to be taken todeal with profiteering, and to make recommendations to theGovernment.The Home Secretary said that he regarded as unworkablethe proposal that tribunals should be instructed to impose fines ifretailers charged prices which they considered unreasonable. Asa test of a criminal offence, reasonableness or unreasonablenesswas not a possible standard: it was too vague. To obtain a conviction certainty was essential. In his opinion a Committeeof Enquiry was the only possible alternative. He had in mindsomething in the nature of an enquiry into costing.The President of the Board of Education suggested that whatwas required was a careful and scientific enquiry into the costs ofone or two staple articles and the prices at which they were being sold. This information would be a valuable guide to the Govern-ment to enable them to determine the real facts.The President of the Board of Trade said that that proposal was already in the Bill. The proposal to set up tribunals was, infact, but a small part of the Bill, and intended only for dealingwith retail profiteering.    Owing to the  way  in which  theI VU] D
memorandum had been drafted, it appeared as if the proposal fortribunals Was the principal part of the scheme, but that wasnot so.The Minister of Food said that the proposal to penaliseretailers would not give satisfaction to the Labour Party. Theydid not pay much attention to the small men, although the latter,were undoubtedly making large profits. The Labour Party wasobsessed with the idea that there were big interests making large sums of money out of the public. He was convinced that theGovernment would require some central department, composed ofpersons competent to go into the whole question of cost.The President of the. Board of Trade pointed out that pro-vision for that was also made in the Bill.The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Food saidthat if the latter part of the Bill were carried out, giving theBoard of Trade power to make investigation. and to inflictpenalties, that of itself would go a very long way to satisfy publicopinion, particularly if announcements were made that theGovernment were considering further steps to deal with theretailer. The public would be satisfied if substantial legislation were introduced for dealing with the big interests.Mr. Bonar Law said that all his information was to the effectthat the retailers were the worst profiteers.The President of the Board of Trade agreed that thiswas so.The Secretary for Scotland pointed out that, if tribunalswere set up in Scotland, their decisions would be annulled by theCourts on the ground that unreasonableness was no standard fora prosecution in a criminal case. A case of the kind had actuallyoccurred under the Defence of the Realm Regulations, where abaker had been prosecuted for making an unreasonable charge for delivery of bread. The Sheriff had convicted, but the convicuc::bad been quashed by the High Court, on the ground that therewas no standard by which the accused could ascertain whether he was breaking the law or not. He suggested that it might bepossible to appoint local committees instead of local tribunals,giving them power to investigate the prices charged by local shops,and to publish the results of their enquiries. A standard of prices would thus be - set up and criminal proceedings, could take placein the ordinary courts.The Minister of Munitions suggested that, if prices weredrastically cut down at home, it would have the effect of divertinggoods to the export trade, and would cause a further scarcity ofsupplies for the home market.Mr. Bonar Law pointed out that the Government actionagainst profiteering in Italy had been, very successful, and prices had come down.within a week.The Minister of Food pointed out that, if a tribunal in one place decided that a certain price was excessive, while anothertricunal. decided that the same price was not excessive, the result would be to divert supplies to the second area, and the first area would be cut off from supplies of that commodity. He thoughtthat the proposals were going to have a very detrimental effect upon enterprise.Sir Eric Geddes very much doubted the wisdom of givinglocal tribunals power to fix prices. The power of investigationshould be enough. Public opinion would operate very stronglyupon local retailers if the decisions of the tribunals were published.Undoubtedly if prices were fixed there would&apos; he starvation in .certain districts,- Mr. Bonar Law suggested that it would not be enough toleave it to public opinion to frighten the retailers. The public would say that, if the Government had proved that there wasprofiteering, it was the duty of the Government to stop it.Sir Eric Geddes continued that the local tribunals should report to the central body.  The central body should examine their
decisions in relation to the cost of manufacture, and should beempowered to penalise the retailers if they thought fit. To leave it to a local tribunal, without experience, to fix prices and to inflict fines would lead to very great trouble.Lord Curzon suggested that the proposals contained in thememorandum should be referred to a Select Committee of theHouse of Commons. Everybody felt that something should bedone, but the Government ought to have the support of publicopinion for their proposals before taking action. He thought thatsuch a Committee should report in ten days or a fortnight.The President of the Board of Trade did not think that sucha Committee could report, with any knowledge, in that time,though&apos; no doubt they could give a general opinion on the factssubmitted to them.The Minister of Labour thought that it would be worth while to bring in a Bill at once in order to deal with the wholesaleprofiteers. There were undoubtedly wholesale &quot; rings/&apos; A newone had recently been formed in the cement trade. He would limit the Bill to the proposals for dealing with the wholesale trade, andwould. announce that the Government were further considering how to stop profiteering in the retail trade, and were appointing a Select Committee for that purpose.Sir Eric Geddes thought it would be very dangerous to havecommittees in certain districts to decide what profits should beallowed for perishable goods, the trade in which was necessarilyof a speculative character, and would require a large margin of profit. It would be impossible, for a local tribunal in such a case to give a considered judgment, and if extremists were included among the members they would have every opportunity of causinggross injustice.The President of the Board of Trade pointed out that we had had experience of tribunals for three years under the MilitaryService Acts, and in a rough and ready way they had worked verysatisfactorily.   The Labour Party had been represented on them.The Minister of Labour pointed out that conditions were nowentirely different. The extremists must be represented on everytribunal, and would not in this case be subjected to the pressure of public opinion, which had produced unanimity in the case of conscription.The Minister of Food agreed, and said that if tribunals werecomposed only of traders and professional men it would give riseto suspicion. If trade unionists and co-operators were added, and effect were given to their wishes, injustice would be inevitable.The President of the Board of Education pointed out thatretail dealers were as much entitled to make a living as anybodyelse, and it was frequently very difficult to say what prices werefair and what unfair. As had been pointed out by Sir Eric Geddes,it was necessary to allow a very large margin of profit in dealingwith perishable goods, and it would be difficult for a tribunal tosay what was a fair price.Mr. Bonar Law said that the proposals in the memorandum,in his opinion, involved a more drastic interference with the laws of supply and demand than anything that had hitherto been attempted.The President of the Board of Trade said that the powerstasked for would not&quot; automatically interfere with supply and demand, but could be made to do so.Mr. Bonar Law enquired whether anything could be done toregulate the prices of such things as clothes and boots withoutresorting to legislation.The President of the Board of Trade said that the Governmentcould themselves go into trade. The Ministry of Munitions hadthe necessary machinery for the purpose. An experiment hadalready been made with the standard suit scheme. It was notsuccessful, in his opinion, because it had not been tried on a large
enough scale. On the whole, however, he was of opinion that itwas most undesirable that the Government should attemptanything of the kind.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, reviewing thewhole discussion, he was of opinion that if a scheme could be Qprepared for testing the prices of staple products in order toobtain some idea of any undue profits which were being made, and publishing the same, it would go a long way to provide a remedy.It would focus public opinion on the profits of both manufacturers and retailers; they would be severely frightened, and prices would come down immediately.Mr. Bonar Law suggested that the best course would be to institute an enquiry, on the lines suggested by the President ofthe Board of Trade, into the prices and cost of production of bootsand clothes, and also to appoint a Select Committee of the Houseof Commons to go into the whole question of profiteering. Heenquired whether it would not be possible to obtain particulars of the various stages in the cost of a suit of clothes, from the rawwool to the finished article.The President of the Board of Trade said that it would be quite possible, but the Board of Trade had no power to compeltraders to produce their accounts. The various stages in the costof a standard suit had recently been widely published in the press.The Minister of Munitions said that his Department had had figures of cost right up to the time that the control of woolwas released, and a committee of 7 manufacturers and 7 labour members under his Department was now investigating the prices charged by retailers.The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested that if a Houseof Commons Committee were appointed they would have power to demand figures.Some discussion took place as to whether, if a SelectCommittee were appointed, it would have power to compel theproduction of accounts.Lord Curzon enquired whether a Committee could not be setup, and at the same time the Board of Trade be instructed to publish at intervals the prices of different articles.The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Food saidthat that had been done at the Ministry of Food with the most undesirable effect, that resentment had been redoubled because thepublic had been unable to secure articles at the prices quoted.That course was of no use unless the Government could at thesame time take steps to secure that purchases could be made atthe standard prices.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) A Select Committee of the House of Commons should beappointed to investigate whether excessive profits werebeing made out of dealings in staple articles, and tomake recommendations.(b.) An announcement should be made in the Plouse ofCommons that the Government themselves were also considering what steps could be taken to deal withprofiteering.General Pershmg&apos;s 6. The War Cabinet, being informed that General PershingVisit. would arrive in London on the following day, decided To request the Secretary of State for War to arrange, ifpossible, to meet General Pershing in person on his arrival on behalf of the War Cabinet.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I.July 14, 1919.o
