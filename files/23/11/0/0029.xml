1. THE Secretary of State for India said lie wished to draw theattention of the War Cabinet to telegram No. 1263, which had beenreceived from Mr. Balfour, stating that at a meeting of the Councilof Five, on the 12th instant, M. Tardieu had described the discus-sions which, had taken place in the Committee on Greek affairs since the question had been last considered by the Council. Allthe Delegations had accepted the creation of an international Statecomprising Dedeagatch, the railway connecting that port with bulgaria, and the Valley of the Maritza&apos;; but, while the British,French, and Japanese desired to increase this State by territorytaken from Bulgaria on the north and west, giving it the frontier of 19.15 on the east, the United States Delegation wished to increaseit by territory on the west, including Adrianople, and to leave toBulgaria the territory on the north and west which the other threeDelegations proposed to give to the international State. Later,the issue narrowed down to a choice between the creation of aninternational State and. a plan, which was accepted by the other delegations, to confine the principle of internationalisation to theport and town of Dedeagatch, which was to control the railwayto Bulgaria. It was resolved that Mr. Polk, after consultingM. Venizelos, should address a telegram to President Wilson, who should decide the question. Mr. Montagu said that this decisionfilled him with astonishment and alarm. Adrianople was largelyTurkish, and the city, with its tombs, was even more sacred thanConstantinople. It seemed an extraordinary thing that it shouldbe proposed to hand it over to Bulgaria, who had distinguishedherself during the war by her treachery and barbarous methods of fighting. To hand over the town of Adrianople would cause thebitterest resentment in the Mohammedan world. It seemed anamazing thing that the decision should be left in the hands of president Wilson, whose country had never been at war with turkey or Bulgaria.The Secretary thought that the text of the telegram waspossibly misleading, and quoted from the minutes of the meeting referred to in the telegram (Paper H.D.-29), when, inter alia, it hadbeen suggested that the port of Dedeagatch, the town of Adrianople,and an area covering the railway connecting these two, should be constituted into an autonomous State under the League of Nations,and that, with the exclusion of Adrianople, the whole of eastern thrace, as comprised between the Turco-Bulgarian frontier and aline drawn from the Gulf of Xeros to the south of Midia, should begiven to Greece. Mr. Polk had stated that he was committed to theplan of an international State, but he.was willing that M. Venizelosshould try and persuade President Wilson to accept the secondplan. If President Wilson accepted, Mr. Polk would be willing tobe over-ruled. It was then agreed that Mr. Polk should confer with M. Venizelos, explain both solutions to him, and submit themto President Wilson. Mr. Polk would inform M. Venizelos that hewas at liberty to send himself any message he desired to PresidentWilson. Sir Maurice Hankey said that there was nothing in theminutes to show that the actual decision had been left to thePresident of the United States.The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theprinciple of an international State had been accepted by all the delegations. The only question they had to decide was what wasto be the size of that State, and this question arose in respect ofDedeagatch. What they all wished to avoid was that,-after the war,the Balkans should become an even greater storm-centre than before. The suggestion that Adrianople should be handed over tothe Bulgars dated from last January, when Mr.&apos; Balfour went to thePeace Conference. He thought there must be some misunder-standing, and suggested that the matter could be left in Mr. Balfour&apos;shands with the completest confidence.The Secretary of State for War drew attention to the very
3 WC6I5  10pserious position in Turkey.    There were seeds of trouble every-where, e.g\, Smyrna, while we had ev,ery reason to fear that ourO withdrawal from the Caucasus would be the signal for a generalmassacre of the Armenians. He would be glad to know how long itwas proposed to keep an Army of Occupation in Turkey. Themaintenance of that army was very costly, and it was difficult to induce our men to go there. He would be much relieved if the WarCabinet would decide that all our forces should be withdrawn from turkey in the course of the next two months. The situation, ashe had said, was grave, and it reacted on Mesopotamia, where wehad about 100,000 men, including 20,000 white troops, and railways were being built there at great cost. It was, unfortunately, the fact,that, whatever terms were proposed to Bulgaria, we had not sufficient military power to enforce them.(At this point Lord Curzon left the Cabinet.)The Prime Minister said that he himself had never imaginedthat Adrianople was to be handed over to Bulgaria. He wonderedwhat our position would be if the United States Congress refused toaccept the mandate for Constantinople. He thought that the currentwas running strongly against our having anything to do with theTurkish boundaries in the north. The sooner, however, we came to some satisfactory arrangement, which would be endorsed by theWashington Government, the better.The Secretary of State for India said that the situation inMesopotamia was rapidly growing worse. There was a tremendousagitation there against the British, and a regular conspiracy hadbeen started to undermine our authority.After some further discussion, the War Cabinet decided that The War Office should submit a statement (a.) Of what the non-settlement of Turkey was costing us.(6.) Of what our expenditure ,in Palestine and Mesopotamiaamounted to respectively.Use of Government 2. With reference to War Cabinet 602, Minute 1 (a), the WarMotor-cars. Cabinet had under consideration a note by the Secretary ^paper g.T.-7970) covering a statement showing the number of cars in use by the various departments, and their running expenses, and also astatement of cars considered essential for the conduct of the depart-inental business of the Air Ministry (Paper G.T.-7989).After a lengthy discussion, the War Cabinet decided (a.) To authorise the Leader of the House of Commons to makea statement in Parliament to the following effect: &quot; Ministers have decided to give up the carshitherto allotted to them. The Government have further decided that no cars should be personallyallotted to anyone. A-certain number of cars arenecessary for the service of the departments, andthese will be used for Government service only.The number of cars has already been greatly reduced,and steps are being taken to effect further reductionsat once.&quot;(6.) That official motor-cars should not be used to take ministers or officials to and from their homes.(c.) That the date from which the above decision should haveeffect should be the date of the adjournment of Parlia-ment.The Secretary of State for War asked that it might be placedon record that, while accepting the above decision, he didnot consider it conducive to the efficiency of the PublicService.[619]B 2.
The First Lord of the Admiralty associated himself with thisview.Labour Policy :Hours of Employ-ment and minimum rates of WagesCommission Bills.UnemploymentInsurance Scheme.3. With reference to War Cabinet 614, Minute 1, the PrimeMinister asked if the Minister of Labour could make suggestionsregarding references to labour questions in his (the Prime Minister^)speech on the following Monday.The Minister of Labour said he was proposing to have introduced in the.House on Monday two Bills closely affecting labour; (a)the Hours of Employment Bill, and (b) the Minimum Pates ol WagesCommission Bill. There was one change in the 48-hours-week Bill,which had been made since the matter had last been discussed atthe Cabinet. It had originally been proposed to exclude railwaysfrom the scope of the Bill, but this had met with a good deal ofobjection, and he felt that the Government ought to give way onthis point, especially as an 8-hours day was already in operation on the railways and only the question of overtime was affected.Both the railway men and the authorities were agreed on the wayovertime should be worked. Sir Robert Home added that agri-culture was excluded from the Bill, as well as certain other classesof workpeople.The Minister of Labour, continuing, said that the PrimeMinister might also mention, in his speech, the fact that the Ministryof Labour had under preparation a permanent scheme of JJnenxploy-ment Insurance for all trades.Mr. Barnes said that a permanent Unemployment BenefitScheme opened up a big question, and he doubted whether it wouldbe possible to get a Bill through the House during the autumn session.The Prime Minister said that he had heard it suggested that each trade should take a hand in the solution of its own unemploy-ment problem, and he thought that conferences might be held atwhich each trade would endeavour to formulate its own scheme.The Minister of Labour said that the difficulty of each tradehaving its own unemployment scheme was that some trades had alot of unemployment and other trades practically none. Sometrades for example, the Transport workers were not In a positionto support a scheme of the kind. The only way to make a schemework was to make the good trades support the bad.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he thought it wouldbe unsafe to commit the Government at the present moment to theintroduction of a Bill dealing with a scheme for unemployment.The Minister of Health mentioned that such a scheme would affect health insurance. In fact, unemployment insurance and health insurance must go together.The Secretary of State for War asked whether&apos; it was necessaryfor the Prime Minister to make a great feature of labour in his speech on the following Monday. It could not be said that labour questions had been neglected during the present Session, and hethought that it would be possible to take a more just view of alllabour matters in the autumn.A short discussion then followed on the questions of- profit-sharing and a share by workers in the management of industry, thelatter proposal being favourably commented on.The War Cabinet decided (a.) That the Minister of Labour should provide a shortsummary of the Hours of Employment and minimum rates of Wages Commission Bills, for the use of thePrime Minister in his speech on the following Monday..(&amp;.) That, although some reference to unemployment might bemade in the Prime Ministers speech, it was undesirable to commit the , Government to the introduction of a bill dealing with this question.
