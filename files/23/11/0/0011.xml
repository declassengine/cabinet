2The Coal Strike.1. The War Cabinet had before them a report on the situationin Yorkshire, sent by Sir Eric Geddes to the Secretary to the WarCabinet (Paper U.C.-6). Sir Eric Geddes asked that, in view ofthe extension of the strike to Lancashire and Nottinghamshire, his powers should be extended to these two counties, and that, in theevent of this proposal being sanctioned, the Home Office should give the same instructions to their mining inspectors in regard toreporting to him direct, in Lancashire and Nottinghamshire, as in yorkshire. Sir Eric Geddes also thought that a warning should beissued in Yorkshire to the effect that the railway services would have tobe restricted in the near future. He also asked approval of the Cabinetto call together the mayors of the principal towns of the district, ifnecessary, in order to invite them to enforce restrictions in electric-lighting, water, and gas. He laid stress on this as a factor both of moral and material importance.A further telephone message (Paper U.C.-7) was received fromSir Eric Geddes a few minutes before the meeting of the Cabinet, inwhich he stated that the whole of the co-operative societies south ofBarnsley had struck against their employers the miners themselvesbeing the employers. The miners would not undertake the distri-bution of food from their shops, as it would be &quot; blacklegging&quot;their employees, who were striking against them. Sir Eric Geddesstated that he had seen the local Eood Controller, who wished toorganise a system of Government distribution, but Sir Eric had instructed him not to do this.The Food Controller said that the reason for the strike of the employees of the co-operative societies was that they wanted their war bonus transferred into permanent wages. He was expecting areport from Barnsley on the situation at any moment, but stronglydeprecated the Government undertaking the distribution of food.The President of the Board of Trade said that, as regards the yorkshire coalfield, the position had not changed very materiallysince the previous Sunday. Pumping had been stopped at two orthree mines where it was being carried on last Sunday, and atone ortwo mines pumping had been restarted by the officials. Sir auckland geddes then gave the Cabinet detailed information regarding the pits which had stopped pumping on the previous day. He also gave the Cabinet the following information regarding coal strikes in otherparts of the country, and the reasons for the men striking: Derbyshire45,000Notts ..Mansfield districtWorsopPleaseleyLang withLancashireBurnleyWesthoughton ..WalsallMonmouthshire ..AbertilleryGlamorganScotland Various districtsKentNorthumberlandAshington       ..1Iy about 10,000IJIncrease of 6s. per ton in price ofcoal.

The Prime Minister observed that the miners seemed determined to strike, and seized on any excuse in order to &quot; down tools.&quot;Mr. Bonar Law thought the reason for this was that the miners( : imagined that they could get satisfaction of any demands they liked to make by striking.Shipping Position. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary to the Ministry of Shippingsaid that instructions had been received from the Board of Trade tomake up the reserves of coal in all the Southern ports. The full capacity of these ports was 100,000 tons. If immediate results weredesired from these instructions, it would be necessary for theMinistry of Shipping to re-requisition ships. Such a course wouldmean a great deal of expense, as it would entail the breaking ofcharters, and possible claims against the Government.The President of the Board of Trade said that on Saturday lastall &apos; export of coal was stopped, in so far as it was possible to do so without blocking the ports. His view was that, if a big strike was coming, it was necessary to divert ships at present on the sea,destined for foreign ports, to British ports. If this was done, itmight result in any amount up to 200,000 tons of coal being brought back to this country.The Prime Minister said that he thought the Governmentshould take all steps to meet a big strike if it was coming, and forthis reason he was in favour of all ships carrying coal, at present at sea, being diverted to British ports.The President of the Board of Trade said that Local Authoritiesdid not possess statutory powers to act as coal merchants, and he asked for authority to assure them that any steps which they tookto store coal would be authorised by the Government.f The Prime Minister said that he thought Local Authoritiesshould stock the coal on behalf of and as agents for the Government.The Secretary of State for War informed the Cabinet that hehad given orders for two divisions of the Rhine Army to be moved tothis country.The President of the Board of Trade said that he had receiveda message that M.r. Sinillie and Mr. Hodges had left Keswick at10 o&apos;clock that morning, and would arrive at Euston at 6*45 p.m.The War Cabinet decided -(a.) To approve the extension of Sir Eric Geddes&apos; powers todeal with the strikes in Lancashire and Nottinghamshire ;(6.) That the Home Office should give instructions to theirofficials in Lancashire and Nottinghamshire to report toSir Eric Geddes direct;(c.) That Sir Eric Geddes should have full discretion and authority to announce a restriction of railway services in areas covered by the strike ;(d.) That Sir Eric Geddes should have authority to call together the Mayors of the towns in the affected areas, with aview to the enforcement, at his discretion, of restrictionson electric lighting, water, and gas ;(e.) That the Food Controller should not undertake the distri-bution of food in the Bai*nsley district;(/.) That the Ministry of Shipping should immediately re-requi-sition ships carrying coal to foreign ports, which alsoinvolves requisitioning the cargoes of coal;(gf.) That local authorities should not trade in coal themselves,but that they should act as agents for the Governmentin the stocking of coal; the President of the Board ofTrade to take responsibility for concerting any measures required by the Ministry of Health, the Scottish Office,C or other Departments, to notify Local Authorities.
2. With reference to War Cabinet 595, Minute 2, and WarCabinet 596, Minute 1, the War Cabinet took note that Mr. Balfourwould shortly be sending a communication on the subject of diplo-matic representation at the Vatican, pending the receipt of which thematter was reserved for, discussion at a later date.Peace Celebrations. 3. With reference to War Cabinet 589, Minute 4, Lord Curzon,as Chairman of the Peace Celebrations Committee of the WarCabinet, read out the following letter which he had received fromthe King, expressing His Majesty&apos;s entire approval of the arrange-ments that had been made for the Celebration of. Peace on the19th instant: &quot; My dear Curzon, Buckingham Palace, July 21, 1919.&quot;Iam desired by the King to express to you and to allconcerned, His Majesty&apos;s entire satisfaction with the decorationof the streets, and with the arrangements for the accommoda-tion of the public in the Mall and Constitution Hill on Saturdaylast.&quot; The King was especially pleased with the Royal Pavalion,and he wishes that an expression of his appreciation may be conveyed to those responsible for its design, and for the rapidityand effectiveness with which the work of construction wascarried out.&quot; His Majesty feels that a great advance has been made inthe artistic treatment of our street decoration.&quot; Yours very sincerely,(Signed) .&apos;&apos; Stamfordham. &apos;&apos;Lord Curzon stated that, in his reply to Lord Stamfordham, hehad said that His Majesty&apos;s gracious letter would give the greatestsatisfaction to all concerned, particularly to the Office of Works andthe War Office, to whom the chief part of the credit was due.The War Cabinet took note of Lord Curzon&apos;s statement, and requested him to communicate to the members of fthePeace Celebrations Committee the War Cabinet&apos;s apprecia-tion of the very successful way in which their functions hadbeen performed.They also directed the Secretary to place on record their own recognition of the admirable manner in which thearrangements had been carried out by the Office of works and the War Office.DiplomaticEepresentation atthe Vatican.   .Office 4. With reference to War Cabinet  569, Minute 1, the WarAccommodation.       Cabinet had under consideration the following Papers : (a.) In regard to Office Accommodation and Demobilisation,Memoranda by the President of the Board of Trade(G.T.-7246 and G.T.-7300), a Memorandum by the first commissioner of Works (G.T.-7262), a Memorandum bythe Food Controller (G.T.-7427), a Letter from the WarOffice (G.T.-7494), a Letter from the Ministry of Muni-tions (G.T.-7548), and the Report of Lord Cave&apos;s-Committee (G.-253).(6.) A Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade,covering a draft Bill for the liquidation of war work ofGovernment Departments (G.T.-7519);(c.) In regard to post-war office accommodation, a Memorandumby&quot; the  First  Commissioner of  Works  (G.T.-7598),(Appendix), a Memorandum by the President of theBoard of Education (G.T.-7632), a Memorandum by the............................Admiralty. (G.T.-7661), a Memorandum by the President
of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries (G.T.-7670),a letter from the First Commissioner of Works to thePrime Minister (G.T.-7687), and a Memorandum by theMinister of Health (G.T.-7691).The President of the Board of Trade said that the question of accommodation had arisen in connection with the demobilisation ofthe various Departments, and he had been closely concerned with it as Minister of Reconstruction. As stated by the First Com-missioner of Works in his Memorandum of the 1st July, 1919(Paper G.T.-7598), the solution of the problem appeared to lie intwo directions : (a) to erect semi-permanent buildings in suburbanareas on the lines already adopted in the case of the Ministry ofLabour at Kew, and (b) to erect permanent Government buildingsupon Montagu House, Whitehall Gardens, and Richmond Terracesites to provide for the ultimate additional headquarter requirementsof all Departments. There was at present a heavy congestion inthe Whitehall area in respect of the old Departments, whilst others of more recent creation were so broken up that the inevitable result&apos;was the dislocation of work and great loss of efficiency. A decision was required as to whether each Department was to be housed inthe Whitehall area or whether the headquarters only were to beprovided with accommodation there and their routine brancheslocated elsewhere.The First Commissioner of Works said that the real point wasthat accommodation had to be found for departmental staffs which,in the aggregate, were twice the size that they were before thewar. Since the beginning of the war no less than six new Ministrieswith large staffs had been created, e.g., the Ministries of Pensions,Labour, Supply, Ways and Communications, and so on. In his view there were some Departments which, at any rate for the present, neednot be accommodated in Whitehall. An urgent problem was therelease of requisitioned premises, in which no less than 32,000 officials,clerks, &amp;c, were housed, and which ought to be relinquished as soonas possible. During the war the Board of Education had been compelled to vacate its premises and to move to Kensington, in orderto make way for the new branch of the Admiralty Controller, whichhad been introduced when Sir Eric Geddes was First Lord. He hadthe greatest difficulty hi persuading Departments in temporaryoccupation of buildings to give them up, and he would be glad ofthe assistance of some body, with full Cabinet authority, to decidequestions of accommodation. He had, in one of the Papers beforethe War Cabinet, suggested that such a body might be a small committee, composed of the Leader of the House of Commons, theChancellor of the Exchequer, and the first Commissioner of Works.Only questions of first-class importance would of course be referredto this Committee. Difficulty had arisen in regard to the buildingnow occupied by the Sugar Commission. The staff of theCommission numbered only sixty members, but they occupiedpremises which were capable of accommodating many times that number. The intention had been to move this Commission to thebuildings occupied by the Food Controller. This, however, had been rendered impossible by the recent decision of the War Cabinet thatthe Ministry of Food should continue to exist. In his Paper of the1st July, he had made eight definite recommendations, and he hopedthat the War Cabinet would reach decisions in regard to them that morning.The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that thequestion of accommodation in the Foreign Office very shortly wouldbecome one of urgency. Lord Cave&apos;s Committee had recommendedthat both the Department of Overseas Trade and the Board of trade should be housed there; moreover, accommodation would &quot;have to befound for an enlarged staff, which would be required to deal with problems connected with territories for which Great Britain would[312] C
be given the mandate. As regards the First Commissionersproposal to set up a small but powerful Committee to decidequestions of accommodation, he pointed out that all Committees sofar dealing with this subject had been Government Committees, andconsequently were not impartial. He suggested that what was required was some powerful outside body, with a man of first-classadministrative ability in the Chair, which should be set up to dealwith all questions of accommodation. The Compton-RickettCommittee had been a purely advisory Committee ; so far as he knew, its Report had never been published, and he did not knowwhether or not its recommendations had ever been acted upon.In his opinion, an urgent decision on the part of the WarCabinet was required as to (a) whether the Cabinet were toadopt the principle that headquarters only of Departments shouldbe housed .in Whitehall, and the routine branches placed elsewhere;and (6) what arrangements should be made for the accommodation of such Departments or parts of Departments as might be left inthe Whitehall area. An important question of policy had been raised by the First Commissioner of Works, which the latterMinister had very rightly judged not to be within the competence ofhis Department.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was opposedto providing fresh accommodation until existing&apos; staffs had beenvery substantially reduced. As regards Sir Alfred Mond&apos;s recom-mendations, he hoped that the second proposal did not mean thatCaxton House was to be bought outright, which would involvea prohibitive outlay. He agreed with Lord Curzon that a non-Governmental Committee would be preferable to one composed ofMinisters. At the head of such a Committee there should besomeone who knew exactly what was involved in departmental responsibility. He suggested that the Cabinet might accept theprinciple of decentralisation, and seek the advice of some outsideperson of experience in regard to the particular Departments whichmight most, easily be decentralised, and as to various economies which might be effected.The Food Controller said, with reference to the question of theremoval of the Sugar Commission, that both this Commission andthe Wheat Commission were Royal Commissions appointed beforethe Food Ministry had been created, and they regarded themselves,consequently, as somewhat privileged bodies. His own view wasthat, as his Ministry was to continue in being, these two Commissionsshould be incorporated in it.Mr. Bonar Law said that he agreed with Lord Curzon as tothe desirability of having outside men of experience and ability toadvise the Government in regard to questions of accommodation andthe reduction of staffs. Very good work has been done by an Inter-Departiuental Committee under Sir Malcolm Ramsay, of the Treasury,which had made some most useful recommendations. What was now required was to set up some body with authority to see that effect was given to these recommendations.The Minister of Pensions agreed that the Ramsay Committeehad done very good service; so far as his Department was concerned,they had gladly availed themselves of the advice tendered by that committee.The President of the Board of Trade said that the RamsayCommittee had been appointed by the Treasury in consultation withhimself. It had been sitting for several months, and had broughtto notice defects of organisation in some Departments.The Minister of Health said that the question of accommodationwas a highly controversial one, and the appointment of arbitrators,who must be disinterested parties, Was most essential. The retentionby the Government of requisitioned premises was causing great dis-satisfaction on the part of the owners, and he was constantly receivingcomplaints on the subject.
The Prime Minister said that, in his opinion, the first thing todo was to determine exactly the numbers of people for whichaccommodation was necessary. The public had the impression thatthe staffs of Government Departments were unnecessarily large, andthat many superfluous persons could be easily got rid of. this impression, he understood, was confirmed by the investigations ofthe Ramsay, Committee. He suggested that any new bodyappointed to consider the question should ascertain what reductionin staffs was feasible, and then it might be determined how muchadditional accommodation it would be necessary to provide in thesuburbs.The First Commissioner of Works said that all the olderDepartments of the Government had always been very extravagantin their ideas as to what accommodation was appropriate. As theresult of repeated representations by the Office of Works, theDepartments had at last been induced to effect a considerable com-pression, and he hoped that the Cabinet would lay down that departments must not be allowed to revert to their pre-warideas.The Prime Minister said that he did not think that it waspossible for the War Cabinet to reach any decision in regard to recommendations 4,5, and 7, in the absence of the First Lord ofthe Admiralty and the Secretary of State for War. He had been impressed by what he had heard of the useful work performed bythe Ramsay Committee, and he thought that it might be desirablethat the Cabinet should have an opportunity of hearing Sir MalcolmRamsay&apos;s views. He suggested that the Secretary to the WarCabinet should be instructed to get into touch with Sir Malcolm,and ascertain from him which Departments have been inspected byhis Committee, what action had been taken as a result of theCommittee&apos;s recommendations, and which Departments still remained to be examined.The War Cabinet decided (a.) To accept the Prime Ministers proposal, and directedthe Secretary to communicate&apos; with Sir MalcolmRamsay;(b.) To accept the principle suggested by the President of theBoard of Trade, that headquarters only of GovernmentDepartments should be accommodated in Whitehall, andthat the routine branches should be housed, as far aspossible, in the suburbs of London, subject to a decisionbeing reached by a Committee (to be appointed later)in regard to the minimum staff required in each department ;(e.) To accept Recommendation &apos;2 of the First commissioner of Works, in regard to the acquisition of Caxton house for the Ministry of Supply, on the understanding thatthe premises shall not be bought outright, and thatthe introduction of a Bill on the subject must be avoided ;(d.) To accept Recommendation 3 of the First Commissioner ofWorks, as to the allocation of Armament Buildings tothe Board of Agriculture and Fisheries ;(e.) To defer the further consideration of Recommendations 4,5, and 7, until the First Lord of the Admiralty and theSecretarv of State for War could be present;(/.) To accept Recommendation 6 of the First Commissioner ofWorks, that Cromwell House, Millbank, be allocated aspart of the permanent headquarters accommodation of theMinistry of Pensions ; arrangements to be made for the friendly Societies Registry to be re-housed elsewhere.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. I,July 22, 1919.
APPENDIX.Submission to War Cabinet on General Question oe Accommodation forGovernment Departments in London.AN important measure of reconstruction which has now to be undertaken is theprovision of permanent headquarters accommodation for the Ministries and Departmentswhose pre-war headquarters premises are now inadequate ; for the new Ministriescreated during the war, and for those now being created.2. In this connection the Ministries and Departments resolve themselves into sixcategories : (1) Pre-war Departments whose staffs have remained more or or less normal, and whose existing accommodation is sufficient for their permanent needs.(2) Pre-war Departments whose staff numbers will be permanently increased as aresult of the war, and who require permanent additional headquartersaccommodation, e.g.,Treasury,Admiralty,War Office,Foreign Office,Colonial Office,Paymaster-General,Office of Works, )Local Government Board (now Ministry of Health),Board of Education,Inland Revenue Department, &amp;c., &amp;c.(3) Pre-war Ministries with scattered accommodation for whom concentratedheadquarters accommodation is required, e.g.,Board of Trade,Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries,Stationery Office.(4) Pre-war Departments   removed  during   the   war  from  Whitehall  area to temporary premises, and who now desire to return, e.g.,Board of Education,Registry of Friendly Societies,Office of Woods.(5) New Ministries formed during the war now in occupation of temporary head-quarters premises, for which permanent&apos;accommodation will have to beprovided, e.g.,Cabinet Secretariat,Ministry of Pensions,Ministry of Labour,Food Ministry (if to be permanent in a limited form).(The Air Ministry are being provided for in Kingsway.)(6) New Ministries now being created for whom permanent accommodation willhave to be provided : Ministry of Supply,Ministry of Ways and Communications.3. The whole question is a most complicated one, as the staffs of practically all thegreat Departments are fluctuating, some decreasing, others increasing, and it isimpossible to estimate accurately the permanent future requirements of any one of thegreat Departments.
One of the certain results of the war, however, will be a vast increase, probably not less than 30,000, in the permanent personnel of the Government staffs in London.In other words, the pre-war number (excluding Post Office staffs) of about 30,000 willbe approximately doubled.4. Certain schemes are already approved, and are being carried out, viz : (a.) To provide concentrated a2commodation for the Ministry of Pensions, IssueOffice, by the erection of semi-permanent buildings at Acton for staff of6,000.   The expenditure is about to be approved by the Treasury.(6.) To remove liquidating staffs (principally Ministry of Munitions) to the numberof about 4,000 to the Alexandra Palace.(c.) To remove the Government Disposal Board staffs of the Ministry of munitions to Earfs Court.(d.) To release certain hotels by the removal to King George&apos;s Hospital of about,500 staff.Other proposals are under consideration, viz. : (e.) To acquire the whole of Caxton and Imperial Houses as permanent accommodation for the Ministry of Supply, whose Headquarters staff is estimated at 2,500. This will involve the acquisition of the leases of anumber of offices requisitioned from business firms, and the removal of others now in Caxton House.(f.) To allocate Armament Buildings, upon its vacation by the Ministry ofMunitions staff (to be transferred to Caxton House) to the Board ofAgriculture.    This building was erected for that Department.(g.) To increase the accommodation for the Admiralty headquarters by an extensionbuilding facing Whitehall.(h.) To increase the accommodation for the War Office headquarters by the erection of two additional permanent stories. -(i.) To allocate Cromwell House, Millhank, as a part of the permanent headquartersaccommodation of the Ministry of Pensions. These premises were originallyoccupied by the Registry of Friendly Societies who were removed duringthe war to the British Museum. I am now urging the Treasury to consent to other premises for them outside the Westminster area.(j.) To remove the Admiralty Controllers staffs from the new Public Offices to accommodation elsewhere, and a most urgent demand having been receivedfrom the Board of Trade for headquarters accommodation in the building, tore-allocate the whole of the space in the building in the followingproportions : Board of Education ... 1,100 staff ... (To return from Kensington).Ministry of Health    ...    1,300   ,,     ... (Estimated       headquarters staff).Board of Trade ...    1,100   ,,    ... (Concentratedaccommodationfor Headquarters Staff in lieu of present scatteredHis Majesty&apos;s Office of premises).Works    ... ...    1,200   ,,4,700   ,,5. When King George Hospital, Alexandra Palace, Earls Court, and the Actonbuildings have been occupied there will still remain, apart from staffs housed in Crownbuildings and buildings held on lease, the following ; 3,400 in hotels and clubs.4,000 in public institutions.9,000 in requisitioned business offices.:      6,500 in private houses and flats.9,000 in temporary buildings in parks and public spaces.31,900[312]D
Assuming that these staffs decrease by 12,000 during the next twelve months, thiswill leave approximately 20,000 for whom other accommodation will have to beprovided.6. After the fullest consideration of the whole matter, I have come to the conclusionthat the only possible solution of this problem lies in two directions : (a.) To erect semi-permanent buildings in suburban areas on the lines already adopted in the case of the Ministry of Labour at Kew, and about to beadopted in the case of certain Ministry of Pensions staffs at Acton and ministry of Health staffs on a site yet to be decided. These buildingswould have to accommodate, for a period of years, if not permanently,certain of the staffs which must be re-housed when their present premiseshave to be surrendered. This, however, involves the immediate considerationof the whole question of decentralisation, as such schemes may include staffs of all the principal departments, and could only be carried into effect by the direct instructions of either the War Cabinet or of a Committee appointedby the War Cabinet to investigate the matter and to give decisions havingWar Cabinet force. The necessary machinery for this appears to exist inthe War Cabinet Committee on Government staffs, though its terms ofreference and power would have to be extended.(6.) To erect permanent Government buildings upon the Montagu House,Whitehall Gardens and Richmond Terrace site to provide for the ultimatepermanent additional headquarters requirements of all Departments. Sucha building scheme is estimated to cost about 4,O0O,000L, and to accom-accommodate some 17,000 staff. Although the cost appears large it could be readily justified, not only in the saving of highly rented premises, but alsoin the increased efficiency resulting from the concentration of large staffsin well-planned buildings. It should also solve the Whitehall problem fora number of years. The scheme would really be an extension of the new board of Trade building scheme which was approved before the war, butnot carried out on account of the war. It is roughly estimated that thewhole scheme could be completed in six years from the date of commence-ment of operations. In view of this and of the fact that a considerableamount of time would be required in the necessary preliminaries, such asobtaining Parliamentary sanction, rehousing the staff at present on the site, &amp;c, I should be glad to receive general sanction to the principle of thescheme so that I can give the necessary instructions for more detailed plans and estimates to be prepared.7. I therefore recommend that the War Cabinet approve : (1.) The immediate consideration of the&apos;whole question of decentralisation by theWar Cabinet Committee on Government Staffs with powers and terms ofreference sufficient to enable them to give decisions, the Committee working in the closest consultation with the First Commissioner of His Majesty&apos;s&apos;/ Works, &amp;c.V   (2.) The acquisition of Caxton House for the Ministry of Supply (Imperial house is already held).    A Bill may be necessary if the interests of the varioustenants cannot be acquired by agreement.   It is, however, hoped that this/ will be possible,v (3.) The allocation of Armament Buildings to the Board of Agriculture on itsvacation by the Ministry of Munitions.Y (4.) The   extension   of the headquarters accommodation of the Admiralty in whitehall.^ (5.) The extension of the headquarters accommodation of the War Office by the; / erection of two additional permanent stories.\J(6.) To allocate Cromwell House, Millbank, as part of the permanent headquartersaccommodation of the Ministry of Pensions, and for the Friendly SocietiesRegistry to be rehoused elsewhere.nc (7.) To remove the Admiralty Controllers staffs from the New Public Offices to accommodation elsewhere, and to reallocate the whole of the space in thebuildings in the following proportions: 
Board of education ministry of health board of TradeHis Majesty&apos;s Office ofWorks1,100 staff,300   ,,1,100   ,,1,200-4,700(To return from Kensington).(Estimated       headquarters staff).(Concentrated accommodation for Headquarters Staff in lieu of present scatteredpremises).(8.) The principle of the erection of a large block of permanent offices on theMontagu House, &amp;c, site, subject to final approval of a detailed scheme at alater date.(Signed)      ALFRED MOND.July 1, 1919.
