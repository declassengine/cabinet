Mr. Bonar Law stated that a question was to be asked inthe House of Commons that afternoon as to whether the Govern-ment would retain in a permanent form the Cenotaph which was atpresent in Whitehall He would like to have the views of hiscolleagues as to the reply he should make.The Prime Minister said that this was a question which couldnot be decided at a momenfs notice. In view of the fact that thepresent Cenotaph had been saluted by all the troops on the occasion of the Peace Celebrations, he thought there was a great deal to besaid in favour of retaining it on the present site.B   ,The TemporaryCenotaph in&quot;Whitehall.I 4421
The War Cabinet decided that In reply to questions on the subject in the House of CommonsMr. Bonar Law should say that the Government had notyet arrived at a decision the Cession of 2. The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that a questionCyprus to Greece. was to be put to him in the House of Lords as to the future of cyprus. He was proposing to say that the Government had notyet decided upon their policy, and that the present was not asuitable time to discuss the matter.The Prime Minister expressed the opinion that now was actually the best time to discuss this question. It was a matter that needed discussion, both in Parliament and in the Cabinet.Mr. Bonar Law stated that there was also a question down,which he had to answer, asking whether Cyprus would, be given to greece without discussion in Parliament.The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention to a statement in the press of that day, to the effect thatGeneral Allenby had informed the Greek diplomatic agent in Cairothat Great Britain had decided-to cede Cyprus to Greece, and thatthe transfer would be made on the same day.The War Cabinet decided that Questions in Parliament on the subject should be answeredin the sense that there was no truth in the rumours that ithad been decided to cede Cyprus to Greece; nothing was&quot;settled, and a decision would not be arrived at without giving Parliament an opportunity of expressing its views.The Coal Strike. 3. With reference to War Cabinet 599, Minute 1, the Ministerof Labour said that, although the miners in other parts of thecountry had returned to work, the Yorkshire pits were still idle.It was said that the men and the masters were waiting for eachother to take the initiative before carrying into effect&apos;the agreementarrived at between the Government and the Miners&apos; Federation.People in the other industries which were affected by the shortageof coal, more especially in Yorkshire, felt very strongly that theGovernment should take some action to bring the miners and theowners together.The President of the Board of Trade said that the Coal Con-troller had written to the President of the Yorkshire Miners&apos;Association on the previous day. There were, however, severalpoints of difference with the miners in that county, one of whichwas the claim that each miner should work one hour per day lessthan before the 16th July, regardless of the number of hours per day they had worked then. This reduction was claimed even inthe case of those who had had a seven hours day hitherto.The Prime Minister said that that point would have to befought, and the seven hours day insisted upon.Mr.&apos; Barnes suggested that intervention by the Governmentwould have a bad effect on the miners&apos; attitude.Sir Eric Geddes thought that Mr. Herbert Smith was waiting until the Government intervened before moving in the matter.When he (Sir Eric) was in Yorkshire the mayors of the varioustowns had suggested that they should intervene in the dispute onbehalf of the other industries affected, but at that time he haddissuaded them, on the ground that negotiations were taking placein London. It might be a good thing, however, if they were allowed to intervene now that the dispute was confined to York-shire. In the meantime the pumping situation was getting worse.Seventeen pits were now in danger of flooding, and there was a.general shortage of coal.
The Situation in 4. With reference to War Cabinet 599, Minute 3, the WarRussia. Cabinet further considered the situation in Russia, and had beforethem the following documents : Memorandum by Lord Curzon (Paper G.T.-7778).Memorandum bv the Secretary of State for War (paper g.T.-7785).Memorandum by the Military Intelligence Branch, War Office(Paper G.T.-7805).Memorandum by the Food Controller (Paper G.T.-7807)The Secretary of State for War said that the War Office that morning had received a telegram from General Ironside at Arch-angel. In the telegram, which was dated the 28th July, general ironside said that he had been in communication that morningwith the local government, and had told them quite plainly thatduring the winter they could not count upon the help of Britishtroops. The local government had unanimously come to the con-clusion that, in the circumstances, it would not be possible duringthe winter to continue the defence. General Ironside suggestedthat he should be authorised, when the actual withdrawal com-menced, to issue the following proclamation : &quot; I have been appointed Military Dictator of the Arch-angel region occupied by the Allied forces. I am disarmingthe Russian National Army of the northern region and dis-missing men to their homes. I am withdrawing Allied forces to Archangel, and will embark them there for evacuation.&quot; I warn you that if you attempt to interfere with thisevacuation I shall employ the full force of Army and Navyagainst you, and will deal ruthlessly with all agents com-mitting acts against law and order.&quot; I am setting up in Archangel a temporary localauthority, chosen by the community, With which you may deal&apos;when I have evacuated the town.&quot;No executions of prisoners in my hands will take place from the date of my assuming dictatorship.&quot; I am prepared to exchange all prisoners held by me priorto evacuation against all British subjects held by you.&quot; I shall evacuate these prisoners as hostages should younot agree to this.&quot;The Prime Minister said that he understood that Mr. Smilliehad undertaken to do his best to bring to a close the disputesthroughout the country. He suggested that the Minister ofLabour should write to Mr. Smillie and ask him if he wereprepared to intervene in the Yorkshire dispute.Mr. Bonar Law suggested that Mr. Smillie should be informedthat the Government would take part in a conference between theminers and owners in Yorkshire if he would arrange for such aconference to be held.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The Minister of Labour should get into communicationwith Mr. Smillie, asking him if he was prepared to intervene with a view to terminating the strike in York-shire.(b.) Questions in the House of Commons regarding the York-shire strike should be answered in the sense that theMiners&apos; Federation had promised to bring pressure tobear on the miners throughout the country, to terminate the strikes; that the attention of the Federation hadbeen called to the continuation of the strike in York-shire; and that the Government were now awaiting a reply from the Federation.
General Ironside went on to say that Mr. Hoare considered adefinite armistice preferable to such a proclamation, but that he(General Ironside) could net conclude this as it would also affectother parts of Russia. The telegram went on to say that theposition on the oppressed fronts, except that on the right flank,was nearly stabilised, and that General Ironside was sending a force of 500 Russians to try to make a landing at Onega, wherethey should arrive at midnight on the night of the 29th/30th July.This was the latest information that had been received from.General Ironside. An evacuation was an easy thing to order, butterribly difficult to carry out. He (Mr. Churchill) was very sorry to be associated with such an operation. It would be repugnantto everyone to feel that we were leaving a small Government to fall to pieces, some of whom had stood by us and some of whom hadnot, and to be at the mercy of the Bolsheviks.The Prime Minister asked what broadly was the proportion ofthe people who had stood by us to those who had not.The Secretary of State for War was of opinion that at Arch-angel the proportion was about five to one, and in this view theChief of the Imperial General Staff agreed. The whole episodewas a very painful one, and, to go back into history, reminded him of our operations at Toulon and our desertion of the Catalans. Hehad always recognised that it would not be possible to keep our troops for another winter in North Russia, as they would be tooisolated and might be wiped out. Moreover, to do so would require an enormous political effort in this country. It would give thegreatest satisfaction to the Germans and to the Bolshevist sym-pathisers throughout the world to know that we were evacuatingArchangel. The one place where there was a chance of doingsomething was in the area occupied by General Denekin, and hethought it ought to be made clear that we would assist him byopening up trade and supplying the people with food and muni-tions of war. He suggested that we should do this for a fixed time,possibly six months, and that it should be made clear to General!Denekin that we only bound ourselves for that time, at the end ofwhich the situation would be reviewed. He was in favour of theappointment of a High Commissioner with General Denekin, as suggested at a previous &quot;meeting of the Cabinet. He would alsourge the importance of telling the United States of America and japan what we were doing, and make every effort to get them tocontinue to assist on the Eastern Front. The French were alreadyhelping the Czecho-Slovaks, and had promised to continue to doso. What he specially wished to avoid was a decision to evacuateNorth Russia without any definite policy as regards South Russia.He thought if it was decided not only to evacuate North Russiabut also to throw over General Denekin and the anti-Bolsheviks in siberia, our policy would be very difficult to defend in this country.The Prime Minister suggested that there was surely a mediumcourse between saying we would abandon the anti-Bolsheviks alto-gether and committing ourselves to helping them for an indefinite period. It was very desirable that we should say definitely what we were prepared to do. We could not bind ourselves to helpRussia indefinitely, and must not give any pledges as to the future.Before going on with the question of policy he would like the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff to explain to the Cabinet the existingmilitary situation at Archangel and Murmansk.Mr. Bonar Law, referring to the question of policy, suggestedthat it would be sufficient to say we would not send any men, butthat we would give war material and money for a limited time, andthat we could then use our judgment as to when to cease doing this,and at the same time avoid a disaster.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said there was verylittle change in the military situation since the War Office memo-randum had been written. He had no reason to believe thatGeneral Ironside would not be able to carry out the programme as
outlined in his telegram which had been referred to by theSecretary of State for War. There was no question that GeneralMaynard&apos;s force was very weak. He had played the gamethroughout last winter, and. in consequence, his force had graduallygrown weaker. For some time past we had been expecting theFrench to send a battalion and three batteries to reinforce GeneralMaynarcfs force, but these troops had not yet started. Some daysago he (General Wilson) had written a strong letter on the subject,and, further, had telephoned not only on the preceding day but also on that morning. There was a ship now waiting to take theFrench battalion, and it was supposed to embark on the followingclay. General Maynard had been rather depending on getting thisFrench assistance, and if they had made up their minds not tosend anyone it would have been much better for them to have saidso. There was still the battalion of Marines, the use of which theCabinet had already approved, and he had talked to the Ministerof Shipping abdut utilising the ship which was waiting for theMarines if the French battalion was not forthcoming. He was alittle anxious about the situation on General Maynafd&apos;s front, asthe Bolshevist force at Onega appeared to have been moving west,and. although this force was not very numerous, it must be rernem-bered that General Maynard had only two companies of Britishtroops. Altogether, something like 4,000 men must have gone overto the enemy as the result of the mutiny at Onega, but what had happened to them was not known. He would like to send to North-Russia a senior General to take charge of the operations on bothfronts. So. long- as there was no great danger, it was possible tocontrol these operations from the War Office, but now it was adifferent matter. General Ironside would probably be good enoughto take over the combined command, but he was very urgentlywanted where he %vas. If a senior officer were sent out to takecommand it would probably be best for him to have his head-quarters on a ship off Kem, from where he could co-ordinate theoperations of the two forces. He did not think, if a senior officerwere appointed, there would be any fear of his interfering withGeneral Ironside, and a good deal of the latter&apos;s anxiety would be relieved if he knew there was a senior officer on the spot. He(General Wilson) would like to ask if the Admiralty had arranged for a cruiser to go to Kem.Some discussion then ensued as regards the despatch of war-ships to Kem, and the relative values of a cruiser and a monitor,during which the First Lord of the Admiralty pointed out that what the Admiralty wanted to know was whether a naval force was required, and, if so, would the Chief of the Imperial General Staffleave it to the Admiralty to decide the composition of that force.He added that there was no virtue in a cruiser as compared with amonitor; in fact, the Admiralty view was that, if men and gunpower were wanted, a monitor was the better.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff explained that what he wanted was some addition from home to the naval forces already in the White Sea. Every little helped, and the stronger the naval force the easier it would be to carrv out the operation.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that H.M.S. &quot; Canter-bury&quot; could be sent out at once; probably she could start intwenty-four hours&apos; time.The Minister of Shipping said that one ship would be readyto sail on the following Saturday. Difficulties were being experi-experienced in getting ships ready on account of the Liverpool strike.The Prime Minister said it was very important that, in the debate in the House of Commons on that day, it should be pointedout that the arrangements for the evacuation of our troops in north Russia were being held up in consequence of the Liverpoolstrike.In this view the Cabinet agreed.
The Chief of the Imperial General Staff asked whether, if thesituation during the evacuation grew worse, the War Office mighthave authority to send out three or four more battalions, andpossibly some batteries, in order to avert a disaster.The Prime Minister said it was a question of saving men&apos;slives, and the War Office should take any action necessary withoutasking for Cabinet approval, as there might not be time to obtainsuch approval.This was agreed toThe First Lord of the Admiralty referred to the question ofthe strikes which were still going on, and thought that the situation should be made quite clear to the strikers.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff then raised thequestion of arranging an armistice, as referred to by GeneralsIronside and Maynard. This was-a matter for the Cabinet, buthe suggested that if there were any intention of arranging such an armistice it would be better for the negotiations to be carried outby the Archangel Government.The Secretary of State for War thought that General Ironside&apos;reference to an armistice had been superseded somewhat by his telegram to which he (the Secretary of State for War) had already referred. In his opinion, it would be most disastrous for any british Government to ask the Bolsheviks to grant an armistice.He could not conceive that we could sink so low. It would be verymuch better to evacuate North Russia in our own time, and toarrange for the local authorities to hand over the territory. More-over, an armistice would open up the whole question of our rela-tions with the Bolsheviks through out Russia, and surely we couldnot take such a course without consulting our Allies.The Prime Minister agreed with the views of the Secretary ofState for War as regards a request for an armistice being almostout of the question, but did not agree that we should in any case be under any obligation to consult the Allies. He did not thinkan armistice would be of any use, as we could not trust the Bol-sheviks not to indulge in massacres, and, apart from our honour,it might be ruled out. The only course appeared to be to offer anasylum elsewhere to those people who wished to leave.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff asked if, before ourevacuation was carried out, the local authorities were&apos; to be allowedto pass through our lines to negotiate with the Bolsheviks.The Secretary of State for War was of opinion that this wouldbe most undesirable until all the arrangements for the withdrawalwere complete.In this view the Cabinet agreed.The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs raised thequestion of the debate that afternoon in the House of Commons,and asked if the Secretary of State for War was in a position tomake a statement about our Russian policy as a whole. He could,no doubt, speak authoritatively on the military situation, but thequestion of our future policy in Russia was a bigger matter.Some discussion then ensued about adjourning the meetinguntil a later hour, and it was agreed that, before adjourning, the acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should give his views to the Cabinet.The &quot;Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said therewas a tendency to treat the Russian question in sections, whichwas wrong, as it was essential to look at it as a whole. All round the situation appeared to be one of complete failure. As regardsArchangel and Murmansk, the policy was settled. We were to evacuate those places with as little disgrace as possible. Next, asregards Petrograd, for some time everyone had been expecting the finns, Esthonians, or other anti-Bolshevist forces to reach that place, but these expectations had not been realised. There was really no definite policy.   The Finnish Government was hopelessly
disunited. General Mannerheim had fallen, and the new Govern-in cnt of Finland was resolutely opposed to any operations. Conse-quently he thought the attempt against Petrograd might be written off as another failure. Next, as regards Admiral Kolchak&apos;s opera-tions, Admiral Kolchak was a man of great personality, and hehad large forces under his command. Everyone had had greathopes of his success, but his army had sustained not only a seriousbut a calamitous reverse, from which it was almost inconceivablethat it could recover; .at any rate, it appeared that such a recoverythis year was out of the question. The reason appeared to be thatthe Russian officers were incapable, and that the Russian soldierswould not fight. In fact, the peasants in Siberia appeared to be rather more against Kolchak than the Bolsheviks; it was not thatthey liked the Bolsheviks better, but it was because they got no more economic advantages from Kolchak than from the Bolsheviks.The Omsk Government had the name of being a reactionaryGovernment.The people comprising this Government were men who hadwaged war against co-operative societies, and in consequence had got themselves thoroughly disliked. Take the example of the czecho-SIovaks. At the commencement they went there for the sole purpose of fighting; they now cordially disliked admiral kolchak. There was no element of strength in Admiral Kolchak&apos;administration, and the latest telegram indicated that a rising wasbeing fomented secretly, and would break out at any time. Thesituation was extremely bad. It had been pointed out that the americans and Japanese had large forces in Eastern Russia, Itwas true that the Japanese have somewhat large forces in EasternSiberia, but they were merely consolidating their position there,and when Admiral Kolchak failed, Japan would probably annexEastern Siberia. It was true that the Americans were not in sympathy with the Bolsheviks, but at the same time they were not doing much to support the other side. Their activities were mainly confined to running the Siberian Railway. Mr. Morris,who had. been sent there by President Wilson, was now at Omsk,and took a most pessimistic view of the situation.The Secretary of State for War, interrupting, said that a latertelegram which had been received tended to show that Mr. Morrishad changed his views.The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, con-tinuing, said that the operations at Archangel had been a failure,and so had those against Petrograd; also those being conducted by Admiral Kolchak. The one solitary success had been obtained by General Denekin. For this latter we had provided most of thesupport. Assuming that General Denekims operations were successful, and that he had a maximum of success, it would nodoubt be said that there would be good reason for going onsupporting him. He would like to ask, however, what was goingto be the result. Our military policy would gradually develop into an economic policy, and the question at once arose who was goingto find the money. No doubt we should have to do so, and he wouldlike to remind the Cabinet that a great deal was involved.Reference had been made to the discredit of withdrawing fromArchangel; the same thing was going to be said of our operations in the Caucasus.The Y/ar Cabinet at this point adjourned, and resumed thediscussion at 12.45 p.m.The Acting Secretary for Foreign Affairs, continuing, saidthat nothing had been said up to date about the Caucasus. Hewould like to remind the Cabinet, however, that the problem of theoperations being carried out by General Denekin involved the wholequestion of the Caucasus. There was one period when it had been thought that the Italians could take our place in the Caucasus.He did not know why, because they were neither in a position to do
so, nor did they wish to undertake the responsibility. We were going to start withdrawing from the Caucasus on the 15th August;the country would then be left in a state of anarchy. General&quot;Denekin represented the old Russian party, and would like tocrush the small republics which we had been supporting. We had attempted to draw lines of demarcation across which general denekin&apos;s forces should not move, and when we disappearedGeneral Denekin would move north, south, or west as he liked, andall our good work in the smaller republics would collapse. He(Lord Curzon) would prefer a limited occupation of the Caucasusfor a definite time. He was of opinion that a force of much lessthan two divisions would be sufficient, and he would suggest ourremaining there perhaps for another year in order that eventsmight stabilise. It had always been his opinion that we would not find it an easy or quick matter to withdraw. At present thesituation in that theatre as regards British representatives was somewhat grotesque. General Holman was attached to general denekin&apos;s headquarters in order to assist him with his administra-tive and supply arrangements. General Briggs had also furnisheda report, which was now before the Cabinet, on the principalrequirements of General Denekin&apos;s forces, and had put forward proposals. Yet again the Supreme Economic Council in Paris,which had some 50,000,0007. given to them, and which sum theyhad exhausted on the cost of Missions all over Europe, had nowsent Colonel MacAlpine to Novorosiiskoe to inaugurate an economic policy.At this point the Chancellor of the Exchequer entered, andsome discussion then ensued as regards the proportion of the50,O00,O0OZ. spent by the Economic Council which had been pro-vided by the British Government, and the Chancellor of theExchequer explained that the sum provided out of the british exchequer was 12^ million pounds, to be spent outside Germanyand Belgium.The Prime Minister raised the question of the extent to whichColonel MacAlpine could commit the Government to expenditure,and pointed out that so long as he was only going to report, and did not commit us to any expenditure, it did not matter. Hethought that this should be impressed on Colonel MacAlpine.The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, continuing,said that that could easily be arranged. The officer had been sentwith a view to reporting as to what could be done. In additionto everything else, Sir William Goode (G.T.-7813) had now sent a message to the Cabinet recommending that a sum of 50 millionpounds should be. spent this year in assisting economically those parts of Russia not occupied by Bolsheviks. He further made thefantastic suggestion that the Caucasian railway should be held byDenekin&apos;s forces or forces favourable to him. To sum up, general milne was in Constantinople controlling not only in a military butalso a political sense. General Holman was with General Denekin.Colonel MacAlpine was at Novorosuskoe. Mr. War drop was inthe Caucasus, and now the Americans had&apos; appointed ColonelPlaskell in Armenia, and this latter officer was going to descendon the Caucasus and have his headquarters at Tiflis. Altogetherthere was complete want of co-ordination. We had up to dategiven 17-1 million pounds worth of war-like stores to general denekin. We were paying 120,000Z. per annum for the personnel of the Siberian railway, and we had expended 800,000Z. onmaterials for the same railway. In addition to this, we had given Admiral Kolchak some 250,000 rifles. In fact, the greaterpart of the financial burden was being borne by the BritishGovernment, and the situation was intolerable. He would liketo ask if it was not quite clear that the matter should be regardedas an inter-Allied problem, and that the burden of responsibility should be shared equitably between the different Allies. He had made various efforts to find out what our Allies were doing, and
had written many despatches to Paris, to which he had received no replies. The time had now come when he thought we oughtto have a clear understanding with our Allies as to what the policy should be. We were bound by expediency and honour not to drop completely our friends in Russia. The question was, howwas this to be done. Japan was really looking after her own interest; America was watching Japan, and if it was asked what we were doing, we were bearing the brunt of the whole thing.He would like to suggest that a serious and formal despatch shouldbe sent to our Allies inviting them to agree to a definite policy.There was no use in asking them what their policy was, as he doubted if any of them had one, and it would be necessary for usto indicate the policy we suggested. There were two ways inwhich this might be done: it might be possible to form an Alliedfund into which each Power willing to contribute would put its resources, then each area in which it was decided to carry outoperations might be financed from that fund; the other alterna-tive was to assign areas to the different Powers. He was ofopinion himself that we should cease doing anything in Siberia,and leave this to the Americans and Japanese, and that our shareshould be confined to assisting General Denekin, and in theCaucasus. The French were doing their share in Poland. If an allied fund were established, he would suggest an inter-Alliedbody sitting in London to look after the disbursement of the fund and to regulate policy. He was in favour of not arriving at any decision until the Allies had been communicated with. It wasnecessary for them to realise that they were just as much interestedin the future of Russia as we were, and that we would not go onfinding money unless they undertook their share. It wasscandalous to think that we were always left in the last resort to act on our own. Broadly, he would urge on the Cabinet thenecessity of some means of co-ordination. The want of suchco-ordination was now leading us to disaster.The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that the ActingSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs had not overstated thefacts. He was afraid if any sphere was given to France she would do very little. Under the joint arrangement for theoperations at Archangel we had found the money, and we would never see it again.The Secretary of State for War, in reply to a question by thePrime Minister, explained that the French had 1,200 to 1,400 menin Siberia and some at Archangel. They also had one or two divisions on the Dniester River defending Roumania. He-thought, perhaps, that on the whole the French and Japanese had more men employed than we had.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff pointed out thatthat depended on how you calculated the numbers. If it wasmen out of their own country, the troops that we had in theCaucasus, Syria, and Turkey must be remembered.&apos; The Chancellor of the Exchequer referred to a telegram whichhad been received on the 26th July from Paris, and reminded theCabinet that we were undertaking obligations in all directions.The price of wheat had now soared in America above the guaranteed price. M. Loucheur had come to see him a few daysago, and wanted further financial help for France, or else for our government to allow the French Government to float a loan onthe London market. The Italian Finance Minister was alsocoming to see him that day, and it was pretty certain that italy was also wanting assistance. He.added, in reply to a question byMr. Bonar Law, that he did not think these Countries were gettinganything from America.The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said thatif we continued to support General Denekin he was of opinion thata political officer should be sent to him, and that he should work-in close touch with Mr. Wardrop in the Caucasus.
Mr. Barnes did not feel inclined to support any longer thepolicy adhered to up to date or that outlined by Lord Curzon,unless the prospects of successful results were better. Most ofthe predictions made by the military advisers had been falsifiedby results. In any case, he would give up everything except thesupport of General Denekin.The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs explainedthat he was suggesting not a new policy, but only that there shouldbe some means of co-ordinating the policies of the different powers.Dr. Addison referred to our engagements in the Baltic, and pointed out that it was not clear to him as to what we were doingthere.The First Lord was of opinion that in considering the wholequestion of our Russian policy the operations in the Baltic shouldbe taken into account.The Chief of the Imperial Staff informed the Cabinet thata message had just been received that the French would not send a battalion to Archangel, and it was agreed that a battalion of theMarines should be sent this week in the ship which, had been reserved for the French battalion.The Secretary of State for War could not agree with thesuggestion made by Mr. Barnes; that the results of our operations in Russia were small. His own opinion was that they wereenormous. Although the forces of Admiral Kolchak and general denekin did not exist a year ago, they were now holding betweenthem about three-quarters of the whole Bolshevist, army. Hethought that when one considered the weak elements which hadbeen available it was extraordinary what had been done. If wehad not intervened in Russia the little States in which the Leagueof Nations took so much interest would have been overpowered by now, and we should certainly have been forced to support thecordon sanitaire. The situation at present was that everyonewas demobilising except our most deadly enemies. Some peoplesaid that we should have been better off if we had never given anyrifles. With this view he did not agree. what had been wantedwas the resolute will to win, and had this existed the results wouldhave been quite different. The result of the operations of the next three months might decide the whole fate of Russia. He thoughtpersonally it was quite possible that Admiral Kolchak mightretrieve his position. General Denekin was confident oif his ability to attain successful results.Sir Eric Geddes asked if it was not the case that the furtherDenekin advanced the greater our responsibilities and obligationswould become 1 The territories under consideration were huge,and it appeared to him that there was no end to the extent to whichwe might commit ourselves; and it was not clear what object wasin view. If General Denekin was to make good the line whichhe now held and consolidate the territory which, he occupied, hewould still hold a large force of Bolsheviks. There appeared,however, to be a fascination for going on, and the further he wenton the greater the country behind him. Everything indicated that some of the officers with him had reactionary tendencies.The Secretary of State for War could not agree to the term&quot; reactionary &apos;&apos; being applied to a man who defended the lives ofhis wife and children.The Prime Minister said it was a mistake to treat the piresentmilitary operations in Russia as though they were a campaign against Bolshevism. If the Allies had decided to defeatBolshevism, great armies would have been required. The small british force in Russia had not been sent there for this purpose.It was true that one member of the Cabinet had always urged thispolicy, but he himself had always protested against it. The WarCabinet had accepted the view that it was not our business tointerfere in the internal affairs of Russia. If Russia preferreda Czarist Government, or an Octobrist Government, it was her
business; and the same applied to the Bolshevist Government.Personally he did not admire any of the Russian Governments.The Government of the Czar was thoroughly bad, and there hadbeen many massacres of Jews as bad as those of the Bolsheviks.Hence he objected to the operations being considered as war against Bolshevism. The origin of these operations shouldbe recalled. The Germans, after the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, were marching into regions where they would have acquired wheat, copper, cotton, and all sorts of materials enabling them to replenish the essential supplies of which our blockade haddeprived them. To prevent this, we had tried to reconstitutethe front at the point where it mattered: that is to say, to prevent them reaching the regions where they could obtain the resourcesthey required; Kolchak and Denekin had undertaken to help inthis. As a consequence, they were attacked by the Bolsheviks,who at the time were friends of Germany. If the Bolsheviks had succeeded, Germany might have obtained what she required.Consequently, we continued to assist our friends; but it was not somuch an opposition to Bolshevism as a measure for the prosecution of the War. The reason for our expedition to Murmansk andArchangel was different; the War Cabinet had been told by theAdmiralty that a submarine base might be formed at Archangel,and that,&quot;if Murmansk was not held, a submarine base establishedthere would interfere with our communications with Archangel.The northern expeditions had been undertaken as part of our operations of the Great War. We had not gone to Archangelto attack Bolshevism, and no one would choose to attack Bolshevismfrom that direction if that were their object. Now the war was over. We had said to Kolchak and Denekin and theArchangel Government: &quot; You say that the Russian people are opposed to the Bolsheviks, who are tyrannising over them by the aid of Lettish and Chinese soldiers, and using them to cut the threat of every respectable Russian.&quot; Then the British Govern-ment replied: &quot;In that case we will help you.&quot; We had helpedthem, and for a year we had supplied them with everything they required guns, rifles, machine-guns, ammunition, tanks, uniforms,boots, &amp;c. They made no complaint that we had failed to give them all that they required; not, it was true, on a scale of continental warfare, for masses of heavy guns could not be utilisedin Siberia, with its inadequate communications, as in Europe.The form of our support naturally did not resemble that given toa small country like Belgium against Germany, or Greece againstTurkey. The population of Russia was about 120,000,000, ofwhom 90,000,000, it was said, were willing to be anti-Bolshevist.The problem here was to support Kolchak and Denekin in raisingthis population against Bolshevist tyranny. What was the resultof our efforts % Kolchak had made a successful advance, but thepopulation did not rise in his support. In the case of Denekin,however, the population did rise. In his view this tended to showthat there was support for an anti-Bolshevist movement in the don area. The population here was different in character fromthe population of Siberia. It consisted largely of Cossacks, whoreally seemed to object strongly to Bolshevism. There had been no comparable support in Siberia. Although the population wastwice as large as that of Canada, and included the finest strain of population in Russia, who had fought magnificently in the War,Kolchak had been unable to raise or maintain any very great army.At present the Siberians were reported to be unwilling to face theBolsheviks, from whom they fled, although the Bolsheviksthemselves were reported to be half-hearted. Hence, he himself was opposed to continue supporting Kolchak unless it could be demonstrated that he was leading a people who wanted to be free from Bolshevism. His views in regard to Denekin, however,were different. Denekin&apos;s forces occupied a country containingsome 20,000,000 of population, from which he ought to be able to
raise from 2,000,000 to 2,500,000 men for service in the field.There was no need to send troops, nor officers, since Denekin hadnumbers of officers who had been trained professional soldiersbefore the war. He was, however, inclined to agree with Mr.Barnes that, while Denekin should be supported, we could not maintain the support for ever. We were entitled to give himhis chance, but we could not help to maintain civil war in Russiafor ever. If Denekin really had the people behind him, theBolsheviks could never overcome him. Hence, the PrimeMinister hoped that the Secretary of State for War would makeit clear in his statement that we did not go to Siberia in order tofight Bolshevism, and that the Government stood by the principlethat it was not our business to interfere in the form of Governmentwhich the Russian people desired. As regards Archangel, he hoped that Mr. Churchill would say that our policy was to clearout. Definite pledges had been given to the troops that we should do so, and not to fulfil them would be a gross breach of faith which no Government could, or ought, to survive. Moreover, he asked if the men who were kept there for a winter after our pledgeshad been broken could possibly be relied upon ? He would ask the question of people who said we ought to remain, as to whetherthey were prepared to pay an additional Qd. or 7d. on the incometax ? It would cost the country 20,000,000Z. to keep our forces inNorthern Russia for another year. Mr. Lloyd George then called attention to his speech made in the House of Commons on the 16thApril, a speech which had been discussed in the Cabinet, and thevery wording of which he had carefully discussed with Mr. bonar law. He read a number of extracts from this speech, which hehanded to Mr. Churchill, suggesting that the latter should takethe same line.Mr. Pisher expressed his general agreement with the PrimeMinister&apos;s statement of policy, to which he thought no one could take exception.The Prime Minister said he agreed with Lord Curzon thatthe Allies ought to be made to face the position. He had been present at many discussions in Paris in regard to Russia. TheFrench representatives had always been violently anti-Bolshevist,but in fact they had never done anything effective. They had always wished to carry on the campaign against the Bolsheviks a tour expense. Their operations in the Ukraine had been anignominious failure, and since then they had done nothing. Nowthey were apparently trying to get up a fight against Bela Kun,in Hungary, and he was afraid the Allies would soon be in troublethere. In his view, there was not the same clear case against BelaKun as there was against Lenin. The trouble in Hungary was,he believed, largely due to the predatory action of the Roumanians,and he was glad that no British troops were engaged there. he felt, however, that we must continue for the present to supportDenekin, on the same lines as heretofore.Mr. Fisher said, taking into account the past history of operations carried out by the Cossacks, he did not hope fordurable - political results from the present operations. TheCossacks had never shown much State-building capacity. he agreed with the Prime Minister in thinking that the greatest fearof General Denekin&apos;s failing was on the political side. Thesupreme interest of the Russian situation lay in the possibility ofeconomic development, and it was of the greatest interest to all theWestern Powers to restore peace in Russia.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, referring again to thevarious commitments of the British Government, called attentionto the fact that 500,000Z. had been given to the Roumanians for railway material.The Prime Minister pointed out that this was not in connec-tion with the operations now under consideration.   He thought,
it was worth while to do as Lord Curzon had suggested, in orderto test the bona fides of our Allies. He did not think we shouldblame the Americans, as they had always been very much againstundertaking operations against the Bolsheviks, and what they had done up to date was only on account of the pressure which hadbeen brought to bear on President Wilson.Dr. Addison wanted to be quite clear as to what was entailed by approaching our Allies, and asked, for the sake of argument,if America and Japan said they were willing to continue opera-tions in Russia for the next five years, were we going to do thesame \Mr. Barnes asked if, by continuing for the time being to helpGeneral Denekin, it meant that we should have to arrange a loan of 2,000,OOOZ.?The Prime Minister said that this was not so. It was onlyintended to continue supporting General Denekin as in the past.The First Lord pointed out that the operations in the Baltichad already cost us at least 4,000,000Z. in coal alone.The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs-said hewould like to lay the draft despatch before the Cabinet. All thathe wanted to do was to try and synchronise the policies of theAllies, and then see what could be done. He would like to ascer-tain from the different departments what had been our expendi-ture on all our different commitments up to date, and put these in the despatch.The Prime Minister agreed that this would be a good thing,and pointed out that the people who were clamouring for us to con-tinue operations in Russia had no notion what was the expendi-ture entailed.The Secretary of State for War remarked that it was notpossible to cut down our expenditure until we withdrew our forces. What must be remembered was that the whole thing wasthe legacy of the German war.The Shipping Controller, in reply to a question by the PrimeMinister, said that our expenditure on shipping was very con-siderable.   We had twenty large ships in the Black Sea alone.The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in replyto a question by the Prime Minister, said he did not think that,by sending a political officer to General Denekin, it would be inter-preted as meaning that we were giving him more recognition than we had in the past, and he did not think there would be any harmin sending such an officer to keep him straight. He was not infavour of appointing a High Commissioner, and would prefer apolitical officer. If the Cabinet would agree, he would prepare a despatch to our Allies, and in the despatch he would include theamount we were expending per annum.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the authority which the War Office had now was to send men up to the numberof 2,000. These were referred to as technical experts; they couldbe used for fighting. He would suggest that no further men should be sent out, and also he hoped that it was quite clear thatthe decision was to withdraw our men from Murmansk.Mr. Barnes hoped that there was no question of makingpublic the amount of our expenditure which it was proposed toinclude in the despatch to our Allies. It would not do for it tobe known in the country how much we had spent.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff raised the questionof the destruction of food on withdrawing from Archangel. Theoriginal intention was to leave a Military Mission there and a friendly Government, but, in accordance with the decision now arrived at, it looked as if everything would be Bolshevist when we left.Sir Eric Geddes was of opinion that it would not be desirableto increase the bitter feeling against us by destroying any food supplies that existed, and in this view the Cabinet agreed.E
The decisions of the War Cabinet may be summarised asfollows: (a.) To adhere to the policy outlined in the Prime Ministersabove statement, which was based on his speech in,    Parliament on the 16th April.(b.) The Army Council should have Cabinet authority,without further reference to the Cabinet, to take any emergency measures, including the despatch of rein-forcements, which it should consider as essential forthe withdrawal of the British forces from Archangeland Murmansk.(c.) The Secretary of State for War, in his statement in Par-liament, should make it clear that the strike in Liver-pool and the refusal to put material on board ship foruse in Russia were hampering and delaying the evacua-tion of Northern Russia.(d.) The Admiralty should send Naval reinforcements toKem.The War Cabinet took note that H.M.S. &quot;Canterbury&quot;would proceed there at once.(e.) The officers in command in the Archangel and Murmansktheatres should not be authorised at present to take any steps to arrive at an arrangement between the NorthernRussian Government and the Bolsheviks.(/.) The Shipping Controller should allot the vessel previouslyallocated for the conveyance of a French battalion tothe Admiralty for the transport of the battalion of royal Marines to be sent to North Russia to assist inthe evacuation.(g.) No British Mission should be left at Murmansk.(h.) The War Cabinet took note of the intention of the ArmyCouncil to send out a senior General Officer in eom-mand both of Murmansk and Archangel.(-/.) The supplies of food in Archangel and Murmansk shouldnot be destroyed on evacuation.(;.) Assistance to General Denekin should be continued onthe same lines as hitherto.(k.) The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should arrange to attach a Political Officer to general denekin.(I.) The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should draw up, for the consideration of the Cabinet,a draft despatch to our Allies, with a view to a con-certed policy towards Russia.(m.) The Departments mainly concerned, namely, the WarOffice, the Admiralty, the Treasury, the Air Ministry,the Ministry of Shipping, the Ministry of Munitions,the Board of Trade, and the Ministry of Food, so faras they may be affected, should prepare figures for incorporation in Lord Curzon&apos;s draft despatch, toshow the expenditure of Great Britain in Russia.(n.)&apos; The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign affairs undertook to secure that Colonel MacAlpine, the repre-sentative of the Supreme Economic Council in south russia, should be warned on no account to make anypromises which would involve the British Governmentin expenditure.Lord Curzon asked that the figures might, if possible, begiven in the following form:-(i.) Expenditure during the financial year 1918-1919incurred directly in  connection   with the Russian
Q iooperations. In this category would be included suchitems as expenditure on the Archangel and MurmanskExpeditions; assistance to Denekin and Kolchak; and naval blockades.(ii.) Expenditure not solely connected with the Russianoperations, but bearing thereon. In this categorywould be included such matters as expenditure in theCaucasus and on the Caspian.(iii.) An estimate of expenditure in connection with Russianoperations in the current financial year.2, Whitehall Gardens, S. W. 1,July 29, 1919.
