2Diplomatic .1. WITH reference to War Cabinet 595, Minute 2, the ActingKepresentation at Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs explained that the Warthe Vatican. Cabinet had decided, subject to the approval of the Prime Minister,to revert, after the ratification of peace, to the policy which prevailed before the war, of having no diplomatic representative at the Vatican. The Foreign Office were of opinion that theadvantages of such representation were not enough to justify theGovernment in facing the storm of criticism which would be arousedin the country. While it would be useful in some respects for theBritish Government to be represented at the Vatican, it would not he possible to make out a strong case. A motion had been putdown in Committee in the House of Commons to reduce the Foreign -Office vote in order to call attention to the matter. There was agood deal of feeling in the country, and protests had been &quot;madeeven against&quot; the appointment &quot;of a representative for the period ofthe war only. The Catholic countries, Austria and Spain, were represented at the Vatican. France was not represented there, nor was America. He was not certain whether Germany had been represented before the war or not. In his opinion the proper course was to continue the appointment only until the official terminationof the war. This country had many years ago deliberatelyabandoned the policy of being represented at the Vatican, and to reverse that decision wouid be a very serious step. Our repre-sentative there would have very little business to occupy him. Theadvantage of continuing the appointment would be almost nugatory,and it would certainly raise fierce opposition.Mr. Bonar Law was doubtful whether it would be wise to make an immediate announcement that the appointment would not becontinued. It might be interpreted as yielding to pressure from theProtestants in the north of Ireland. On the other hand, if it were announced that the appointment would be made permanent therewould undoubtedly be very serious opposition.The   Prime   Minister  suggested that the matter should beconsidered from the point of view of the League of Nations and theadvantage of having a representative at the Vatican who could keep... the British Government informed of the tendencies prevailing there.He enquired whether any information was available of the attitudeof the people in the various Dominions.. The Secretary for the Colonies observed that the catholic church was one of the greatest forces in the world, and it was very desirable that we should be officially in touch with the Vatican. he knew that the Prime Minister of Australia attached importance to it.The Secretary of State for War said that he would be sorrj^ togive up the opportunity of using -such influence as we could exercise.He suggested that an announcement should be made that in thepresent disturbed state of the world it was necessary to remain in&apos;close touch with the Vatican.The Chancellor of the Exchequer concurred and suggested thatit could be explained that as the Pope has a great deal of influence in international affairs it was thought desirable that the BritishGovernment should be represented at the Vatican.&apos;- The Acting Secretary of State for foreign Affairs stated thatthe Parliamentary Under-Secretary was very concerned at theopposition to the Foreign Office vote which would be raised in committee in the House of Commons if it were announced that theappointment would be continued.The War Cabinet decided To adjourn the discussion until the following day, when it was hoped that the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for ForeignAffairs would be present.
2, Whitehall Gardens, 8.W. 1,July 21, 1919.Dominions 2. The War Cabinet had under consideration a memorandum byEatmcation of (the the Secretary of State for the Colonies (G.T.-7732) on the Dominions-treaty o eace. au(J the ratification of the Treaty of Peace, in which it was statedthat the Dominions had been informed in the weekly telegram fromthe Colonial Office that it was hoped that the German Treaty wouldbe ratified by three of the principal Allied and Associated Powers bythe end of July.Sir Robert Borden had telegraphed on the 9th July that, as hewas under pledge to submit the Treaty to Parliament before the ratification by Canada, and as no copy of the Treaty had yet arrivedand the Canadian Parliament had been prorogued, he desired to be advised how ratification could be accomplished on behalf of the whole empire before the end of July.The Secretary of State for the Colonies desired the instructions of the War Cabinet as to the course to be pursued in view of thefact that if His Majesty ratified the Treaty he would necessarily doso for all his Dominions. The ratification of the Treaty by theBritish Empire, without the formal assent of the DominionParliaments, would be regarded in the Dominions as anunwarrantable assumption of authority on ihe part of&apos; the Govern-ment of the United Kingdom. It was suggested that a message should be sent to the Prime Ministers of the Dominions advisingthem to call special meetings of their Parliaments at once in orderthat the Treaty should be submitted to them.The Secretary of State for the Colonies stated that Mr. Hugheswould arrive in&quot; Australia on the 10th August. No doubt the parliaments of South Africa and New Zealand could be summonedat once, but it appeared likely that ratification by the AustralianParliament could not be secured before the end of August. Thefailure of either Australia or Canada to ratify would be a serious matter, and it would be most unfortunate if they were not given time in which to consider the Treaty.The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs stated thatthe Treaty provided for ratification by three of the principal AlliedPowers. The Americans were going to take some time, and it hadbeen the idea that ratification should be by France, Great Britain,and Japan.It was stated that Japan could not ratify until the actualdocument was received and decyphered, which would be done somesix weeks hence.The Prime Minister stated that there was no doubt that theDominions should be given the opportunity to ratify. On the otherhand, if the French were likely to receive the assent of theirParliament by August, it would be a serious matter to hold up theTreaty.   No action could be taken on it until it had been ratified.The War Cabinet decided To leave the matter to the Prime Minister and the Secretary ofState for the Colonies for decision.
