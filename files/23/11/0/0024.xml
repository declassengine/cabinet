The Coal Strike. 1. The Home Secretary informed the War Cabinet that the officials and other men who were at present engaged in pumpingcertain of the pits in the Yorkshire coalfield might be compelled to ^withdraw by the strikers, and it would be necessary to employ moreNaval ratings for the work. Primarily the Police were engaged inthe duty of protecting the Naval ratings working in the pits, andthe Military were only called in if absolutely necessary. If, however,the officials from these pits were called out and Naval ratings tooktheir place, there would not be sufficient Police to protect them,and it would be necessary to bring the soldiers out of the backgroundin order to provide this protection. He was afraid that this might provoke the strikers to extreme lengths, but, in view of the factthat, in the circumstances he mentioned, forty mines would be in danger of flooding, he must ask the authority of the War Cabinet totake what steps were necessary for the protection of these pits.The Minister of Labour said he thought the Yorkshire miners were now rather more amenable to reason. In the Conference whichhe had had with them that day he had told them that the Govern-ment would not move from the agreement which they had come to with the Miners&apos; Federation as regards rates. They had thereuponstated that the figures of the Miners&apos; Federation were not correct, astatement which Mr. Hodges (who was also present) had promptlydenied.The Prime Minister suggested that the question of obtainingtroops should be settled between the Secretary of State for War andthe Home Secretary.Sir Eric Geddes pointed out that it was not a question of differences between the Secretary of. State for War and the HomeSecretary. The point was that the mine-owners were afraid that,if troops were brought into the forefront of the affair, the strikerswould get out of hand and attempt to wreck the mines and thehouses.The War Cabinet decided To give the Home Secretary full authority to take any steps he might think necessary for the protection of the mines in yorkshire. ,2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,August 9, 1919.
