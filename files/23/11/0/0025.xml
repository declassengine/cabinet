Post-War office accommodation.1. WITH reference to War Cabinet 603, Minute 3.The First Commissioner of Works said that Sir Eric Geddeshad asked that the use of the Marylebone Hotel (Great CentralStation) might be placed at his disposal for the accommodation ofthe offices of the Ministry of Transport, owing to the difficulty that had arisen in regard to the early evacuation of the premisesnow occupied by the Board of Trade for this purpose.Sir Eric Geddes said that the hotel in question had beenvacated by the War Office and was at present standing empty. Itowed its existence to competition among the railways themselves,and he thought that both as regards locality and general con-venience the building was well suited for the purpose for which he required it.Mr. Bonar Law thought that the general public might object tothe allocation of this building to the Ministry of Transport, aslack of hotel accommodation in London was causing the greatestinconvenience.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that in manycases the requisitioned London hotels, as they were relinquished bytire Government Departments, were not being used for their original purpose, but were being converted into business offices.Mr. Barnes said, that as decided by the War Cabinet at their meeting on the 31st ultimo, he had interviewed, on its behalf, theFood Controller and the Chairman of the Sugar Commission, inregard to the vacation of the premises now occupied by the Corn-mission and its accommodation elsewhere. He regretted to haveto inform the War Cabinet that he had been unable to persuade theChairman of the Royal Commission on Sugar of the necessity forhis comparatively small staff vacating their present premises inorder to make room for a much larger body of officials. The chair-man had, in fact, intimated that if he were compelled to move fromthe present premises, both he and the members of his commission would resign.The Food Controller said that he would be glad if the WarCabinet would sanction the incorporation in his Ministry of theRoyal Commission on Food and the Royal Commission on Wheat.The time was fully ripe in his opinion for such incorporation, andit would make for a greater efficiency.The War Cabinet decided (a.) That the immediate questions of post-war office accommo-dation to be raised by Sir Alfred Mond should be referredto Mr. Barnes to settle, in consultation with, the first commissioner of Works and in communication with theseveral departments concerned, with full powers todecide on behalf of the War Cabinet.(b.) That the Marylebone Hotel should be placed temporarily atthe disposal of Sir Eric Geddes, in order to provideoffice accommodation for the Ministry of Transport.(c.) That the War Office should not surrender the MaryleboneHotel without reference to the First Commissioner ofWorks.Peace Celebrations:Pay of Workmenfor Saturday,19th July, 1919.2. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theFirst Commissioner of Works (G.T.-7886) stating that on a previous occasion the War Cabinet had been asked whether payment for thePeace holiday should be made to workmen engaged by the Office ofWorks (WTar Cabinet 580, Minute 6). The decision then given wasthat directly employed men should be paid for the day, and thatthose engaged through contractors should be governed by thepractice in the trades concerned. In the Office of Works, however,while certain men were employed direct by the Department onmain-tenance work, they were technically employed by the maintenancecontractors; and these men considered themselves as Government
servants- just as much as the established men, and in reality thiswas the case. They had, moreover, pointed out, what was thefact, that while they had been made compulsority to take a holidaythey received no payment, while other fellow workers on the samejob received payment. Sir Alfred Mond asked, in view of the exceptional circumstances of the case, for the permission of the WarCabinet for the payment to all men continuously engaged on main-tenance work, whatever the nature of their engagement. Theamount involved was 1,1001.The War Cabinet decided To refer the question to Mr. Barnes for decision, in consultationwith the Minister of Labour.3. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandum bytho President of the Board of Education (G.T.-7874), asking theCabinet for its formal approval for the setting up of a Royal Corn-mission to enquire into the finance and government of ihe Universitiesof Oxford and Cambridge.   (Appendix.)The President of the Board of Education said that the governing-bodies of both Oxford and Cambridge had formally accepted the ideaof the Commission. He had consulted Lord Curzon, as Chancellorof the University of Oxford, and Lord Curzon agreed with him asto the desirability of the proposed Royal Commission.The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said thathe had accepted the idea of the Royal Commission, so far as OxfordUniversity was concerned, although he expected a considerableamount of criticism in certain quarters.The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that the Universitiesfully understood when they applied to the State for funds, that thedisposal of these funds must be subject to State scrutiny.The President of the Board of Education said that he hadslightly amended the terms of reference as proposed in his Memo-rand um before the War Cabinet, and he suggested that the followingshould be substituted : &quot; To consider the applications which have been made bythe Universities of Oxford and Cambridge for financial assistancefrom the State, and for this purpose to enquire into the financial resources of the Universities and of the Colleges and Hallstherein, into the administration and application of these resources, into the government of the Universities, and into therelations of the Colleges and flails to the Universities and to each cither, and to make recommendations,&quot;The War Cabinet decided to approve :  (a.) The setting up of a Royal Commission to enquire into thefinance and government of the Universities of oxford and Cambridge ;ib.) The amended terms of reference as now proposed by thePresident of the Board of Education.2, WhiteJiall Gardens, S.W.,. 11th August, 1919.Proposed EoyalCommission on the universities ofOxford and cambridge..B 2
. APPENDIX.G.T.-7874. ----Proposed Royal Commission on the Universities oe Oxford and Cambridge.Memorandum by Mr. H. A. L. Fisher.THE purpose of this memorandum is to ask the Cabinet for its formal approval for the setting up of a Royal Commission to enquire into the finance and governmentof the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge.An enquiry into the finance of these Universities has been rendered necessary bytheir application to the State for grants of very considerable sums. Hitherto the Stategrants received by Oxford and Cambridge have been confined to comparatively smallsums received from the Board of Education in respect of the training of teachers andof tutorial classes (in connection with the Workers&apos; Education Association), and grants for agriculture and forestry from the Board of Agriculture. The Department of engineering at Oxford also recently received a small grant of between 200L and 300Z.,and the Medical School at Cambridge about 6,000Z. Both of these grants have been paid by the Board to the Departments of Engineering and Medicine respectively on aper capita basis under regulations which have now been withdrawn in consequence ofthe pooling of the money available for grants to Universities in the Estimates for1919, and- the decision in future to pay single inclusive grants to Universities. Solong as the two ancient Universities were able to subsist upon their endowments and students&apos; fees without coming to the State for any considerable subsidy there was no obvious reason, failing evidence of substantial educational shortcomings, for a Govern-ment enquiry at this moment into their financial resources.The situation of the two older Universities has, however, been greatly affected bythe higher cost&quot; of living (necessitating an increase in salaries and wages) and theincreased cost of essential material and equipment, especially in the sphere of naturalscience, consequent upon the war. And now that the two Universities are applying tothe Government, not only for large capital grants but for maintenance grants of atleast 20,000L a year, the need for an enquiry becomes obvious. Before Parliament canbe asked to vote such sums as these to institutions which are popularly believed to bewealthy it must be satisfied that the Universities are making the best use of theirexisting resources, and that those resources, carefully husbanded and scientificallydeveloped, are insufficient to meet all legitimate needs without augmentation from thepublic purse. I think also that Parliament is entitled to have the same kind, of assurance with respect to the ancient Universities which it has long possessed in connec-tion with those Universities which are in receipt of Treasury grants, i.e., that they are reasonably accessible to poof students and that their frame-work of government iscompatible with efficient administration.An enquiry into the financial condition of Oxford and Cambridge must include an investigation of the financial condition of the colleges. Parliament must be satisfiedthat the colleges are making adequate contributions to University purposes, and thatthey are making the best and most economical use of their endowments. Indeed,the existence of these practically autonomous bodies, and their relation to theUniversity, constitute perhaps the most important aspect of University finance and government. The Oxford colleges have already stated their willingness to co-operate,and there is no suggestion that the Cambridge colleges will refuse to assist theCommission in its enquiry.It is contemplated that the scope of the enquiry should be limited to finance,interpreted to include questions of university and college government and organisationbearing on the financial position. It Avill be- necessary to consider. the University&apos;ssystem of government, the relation of its executive officers to its governing bodies, andthe relation of those bodies to each other. An enquiry into college finance would imply consideration, among other questions, of the system of Fellowships and Scholar-ships, the cost of tuition and living, and the application of college funds to buildings.The Commission would also naturally be led to consider the relation of the Universityto the colleges, both in the financial aspect, with reference to college contributions for University purposes, and in the educational functions of tutors and professors.The complexity of both Universities, their individual characteristics, and their value to the intellectual well-being of the nation suggests that the commission appointed to deal with their finance and government should be so constituted as to
ensure a sympathetic understanding of their spirit and conditions. It is desirablethat the Commission should include a sufficient number of members who are familiar with Oxford and Cambridge, and that it should also include members speciallyqualified to deal with the financial and administrative questions which arise inacademic societies. It is also desirable that labour should be represented upon theCommission, and it would be in accordance with the spirit of the times if one ofthe commissioners, at least, were a woman. Agricultural experts would naturally finda place in a body, one of whose functions would be to report upon the management of the college estates.With a view to greater expedition I suggest that the Commission should be divided into three sections an Oxford Section, a Cambridge Section, and an agricultural Section. The enquiries into the finance and organisation of Oxford and cambridge would be conducted concurrently, and separate reports would be drawn upfor each University. It would, however, be desirable that all three sections beforefinally coming to a conclusion upon their recommendations should hold joint meetings with a view to a comparison of impressions and to the submission of common proposals as to the constitutional reforms needed by the two Universities seeing that they havemany features in common. The function of the Agricultural Section would be toreport upon the management of the college estates and to submit suggestions as to themethods by which the college revenues might be augmented.The readiness of the Universities to co-operate in the proposed enquiries make it unnecessary to consider the appointment of a Statutory Commission. Whether a statutory Commission may be desirable to give effect to the recommendations of theRoyal Commission is a matter that must wait until such recommendations, if any,have been received.I suggest that the reference to the Royal Commission might run as follows: &quot; To enquire into the amounts, character, administration, and application ofthe financial resources of the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge and of the colleges and haUs therein, and in that respect to consider the government of theirUniversities and their relations to their constituent colleges, and to make recommendations.&quot;(Signed) H. A. L FISHER.July 22, 1919.
