Visit of H.E.H. the 1. The War Cabinet briefly considered the forthcoming visit ofPrince of Wales to   H.R.H. the Prince of Wales to Canada.Canada.Peace Celebrations. 2. Lord Curzon said that, as requested by the War Cabinet onthe previous day (War -Cabinet 58(3, Minute 1), he had seen theKing that morning on the subject of Peace Celebrations, and had found that His Majesty desired that the Thanksgiving Services,which it had been intended to hold on the first Sunday in August,should take place on Sunday, the 6th July. The Archbishop of canterbury had addressed a letter to the press on the subject, andwas making all the necessary preliminary arrangements. The draftProclamation which had been discussed at the Privy Council that morning was addressed to all the various religious denominations.The Prime Minister said that it was very important that those responsible for the arrangements should get into immediate touchwith Cardinal Bourne and the several Churches of Ireland and scotland, as well as the heads of the Presbyterian, Episcopalian, andother religious sects.Lord Curzon said that the King had suggested that theprincipal official service should be held in St. pauls Cathedral at about 11 a.m. This would be attended by Plis Majesty and theRoyal Family, morning dress and Service uniform to be worn. TheKing hoped that all members of the Government would be present,and that the Army, Navy, Air Force, and the official world generally would attend. The King, attended by his Ministers, would be met at the head of the Cathedral steps by the Clergy and Choir, and allpresent, including the public gathered in the streets below, would join in singing the Old 100th. Simultaneously, there would beservices in Westminster Abbey, which would be attended bymembers of the House of Lords, and at St. Margaret&apos;s, Westminster,for the House of Commons. It was suggested that the LordChancellor and the Speaker should go to the service at St. Paul&apos;s,but that there should be no formal procession.The Prime Minister thought that the Speaker, the mace, andthe Leader of the House should attend the same service as themembers of the House of Commons.The First Lord of the Admiralty thought that hostile criticismwould certainly be aroused if it was proposed that His Majesty&apos;ministers should attend the official ceremony at St. Paul&apos;s Cathedraland that members of the House of Commons should he excluded.Lord Curzon said that he was informed by the Primate thatSt. Paul&apos;s Cathedral could accommodate about 4,000 worshippers.The King had agreed that Ministers and various officials should be accompanied by their wives.Mr. Bonar Law agreed with the First Lord of the Admiraltythat considerable resentment would be aroused if members of bothHouses were excluded from the service at St. paul&apos;s.The Prime Minister was of opinion that the King should certainly have his Parliament around him at the Official Thanks-giving Service, as this would add to the impressiveness of the ceremony. He thought, therefore, that, if possible, members of bothITouses should be admitted to the service at St. paul&apos;s ; but if thiswas found to be not feasible they should attend the serviceatSt. magaret&apos;s, Westminster, at which all members of the Plouse ofCommons, including the Speaker, would be present, with the singleexception of the Prime Minister, who would be in attendance on theKing.Lord Curzon, proceeding, said that the King also suggested thatthe Army should be represented at St. paul&apos;s by a contingent of,say, some 500 to 1,000 soldiers, including women war-workers.As regards the rest of the celebrations, Plis Majesty had expressed the view that the soldiers generally were rather. tired of
processions and ceremonial marches, though there was, of course, noobjection to big provincial centres welcoming their troops back fromthe front. The King was anxious that the Naval Display on the thames should still be held, though naturally it would have to be cancelled if the weather was unpropitious ; and he was in favour ofof no other function except what was becoming known as the&quot; Children&apos;s Day.&quot; Lord Curzon said that he had suggested to HisMajesty that, if the proposals of his Committee that the four days inthe first week in August should be set apart for Peace Celebrationswere to be abandoned, it would be best to concentrate the festivitieson a suitable Saturday about the middle of July, when the NavalDisplay would be held and national rejoicings could take place, theparks being thrown open and amusements provided ; the festivities to conclude with displays of fireworks. Just before the Cabinet had met, he had enquired of Admiral Halsey, who was in charge of aSub-Committee of the Cabinet Committee on Peace Celebrationsdealing with the arrangements for the Naval Display, whether itwould be possible to advance that function, by some three weeks.The Admiral had replied that he could not., jive a definite reply until he had consulted the members of his Sub-Committee.The First Lord of (he Admiralty said that his Departmentcould not accept any responsibility for the River Pageant; all they could do was to bring a certain number of warships up the thames and provide a contingent of naval ratings to parade the streets.The Prime Minister thought it would be a pity if the proposedMilitary Procession were dropped. In regard to this procession hehad two suggestions to make : first, that a small contingent of 300or 400 French soldiers should be invited to participate ; and, second,that there should be a catafalque at some prominent spot along the route selected for the Military Procession, past which the troops would march and salute the dead.Lord Curzon said, in regard to the Prime Ministers suggestion,that there were certain difficulties in the way. To beein with, Parisoffered ideal facilities for ceremonial displays. Further, the FrenchGovernment proposed to have a Military Procession on the 14thinstant, in which troops of the Allied and Associated Powers wouldtake part. This would be easy, as the troops were on the spot andwould not have to be brought overseas. His Committee had been ofopinion that, in the circumstances, it would be better that theMilitary Parade should be of a domestic character and confined to our own and Dominion troops. He would refer the PiimeMinisters suggestion regarding a catafalque to his Committee, whichwould be assembled that afternoon. If the idea were properlycarried out it should prove very impressive ; it was perhaps, however,more essentially suitable to the Latin temperament.The First Lord of the Admiralty thought that there would be general disappointment if our Allies did not participate in theMilitary Parade, and if our celebrations did not include a properrecognition of the great part played by our Allies in the war.(At this point the Secretary of State for War, accompanied by the adjutant-General and the Deputy Director of Personal Services,entered the Cabinet. Lord Curzon briefly summarised theprevious discussion.)The Secretary of State for War said that he agreed with HisMajesty&apos;s view that the people generally were rather satiated with military processions. The troops, moreover, objected to fatiguingmarches and to being railed about the country, particularly on a daywhich was designed to be a holiday.The Adjutant-General said that he was in full agreement with what the Secretary of State had said.The Prime Minister thought that if a Naval contingent was toparade  the  streets it might  be as well to bring back from the
Army of Occupation on the Rhine a certain number of our troops say, the equivalent of a Brigade of Infantry a,nd some Cavalry to march with the sailors.Lord Curzon said that, if the War Cabinet decided that thereshould. be a Military Procession, it would be difficult to confine the festivities to a single day, as was the wish of the King.Mr. Churchill said that about 3,000 Americans would be in or about London during the latter part of the third week in July, and ithad been proposed that on one of those days they should marchthrough the streets, headed by General Pershing. He suggestedthat these American troops might be associated with our own soldiersand sailors in the Military Procession.Mr. Bonar Law thought there was a vital objection to havingthe American troops and not the French and Italians as well.The Secretary of State for War said that he did not agree. TheLondon populace had already had opportunities of acclaiming bothMarshal Joffre and Marshal Foch, and the French could not object ifwe welcomed the Americans in their turn. American public opinion was very sensitive on the subject, and in his view it might be goodpolicy to conciliate the United States by acclaiming their troops inthe Metropolis.Lord Curzon pointed out that any considerable concentration ofsoldiers in London meant a temporary disorganisation of the railways,and consequent inconvenience of the public. He suggested thatGeneral Pershing and his troops might march through London onFriday, the 18th July. We could then have the Naval Pageant andgeneral rejoicings on the following day. As regards the NavalDisplay, the idea was that the King, in the Royal Barge, with otherbarges in procession, should be rowed up the Thames and disembarkat Chelsea Hospital. He suggested that the Naval contingentshould be paraded in the Hospital Gardens and there reviewed bythe King, after which they would again march through the streets.The Secretary of State for War was in favour of having a combined march on the Saturday, in which the American soldiers,with our own sailors, &amp;c, would all take part.Lord Curzon agreed with the view that had already been expressed that our other Allies might resent it if they were notinvited to send a contingent.The Prime Minister thought that our Allies could not reasonablyobject, as, on the date on which it was proposed to have theMilitary Procession, American troops (who- would be on their wayhome) would be actually on the spot.Mr. Bonar Law concurred in this view.Lord Curzon again pointed out that it was hardly possible tohave both a Military Procession and a Naval Display on thesame day.The Prime Minister thought that this was a point that couldnot be definitely settled until it had been carefully considered byLord Curzon&apos;s Committee. He himself still hoped that it misjht bepossible to have a Military Procession in the early part of the morning of the Saturday, and a Naval Display the same afternoon.The President of the Board of Trade pointed out that the timefixed for the River Display must depend upon the tide.Lord Curzon thought that, whatever else was dropped, itwould be undesirable to omit the Naval Display, which was specially designed to commemorate the splendid services of our mercantilemarine.The Prime Minister said that he hoped that Lord Curzon&apos;sCommittee would consider his proposal of a catafalque, to be salutedby the representatives of the Fighting Services as they passed. Hesuggested that some prominent artist might be consulted on thesubject. His own view was that as many sailors as possible shouldbe collected, say about 5,000, to parade the streets, and to bethoroughly representative.   There might be the same number of
Kingdom.Congestion of Ports 3. With reference to War Cabinet 585, Minute 5, and Warin the United Cabinet 55&apos;Z, Minute 6, the War Cabinet had under consideration aMemorandum by the President of the Board of Trade (Paper G.T.-7483) on the congestion of ports, together with a Memorandum bythe Food Controller (Paper G.T.-7558) and a Memorandum bySir A. Norman Hill (Paper G.T.-7333).The President of the Board of Trade explained that, as statedin his Memorandum, there was considerable congestion of traffic bothin the large ports and in the distributing terminals in the greatcities. One of the main reasons for this was that there was little or no coastwise traffic owing to the competition of railway rates, whichhad not been raised since the war. The railways were in fact beingsubsidised by the Government, while shipping rates had risenconsiderably. Consequently all traffic was attracted to the railways,and shipping was not being brought back into the coasting trade.The position on the railways was very serious, and a breakdown was probable when the autumn traffic set in. Power to raise railway rates was contained in the Ways and Communications Bill, but untilthat was passed there was no power to increase them beyond thestatutory maximum, which was quite inadequate. At present wewere in fact subsidising the inland transport of goods by rail at theexpense of the taxpayer. In addition, there was a shortage of rolling stock and a certain amount of deterioration in the conditionof the lines, together with a very marked shortage of locomotives.The only means of raising the rates was by a special Bill inParliament. He was advised that there was no power to do sounder the Defence of the Realm Regulations. Even if power were taken, it would be impossible to enforce it. Every trader wouldhave the right to appeal to the Railway and Canal Commission, and could not be compelled to pay the new rate in any particular casesoldiers of the various arms. The Air Force, of course, would haveto be represented also, as they had not yet had a chance of beinggreeted by the public.In the Military Procession all sorts and types of guns, howitzers,mortars, flame-throwers, balloon sections, and tanks should beincluded, and Admiral Beatty and as many of his Admirals as couldbe collected, as well as Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig and hisGenerals, should take part in the march. He doubted whether itwas really necessary to have processions, as had been proposed byLord Curzon&apos;s Committee, both in the East End and the West.There were the North and South of London also to be considered.To have too many processions would mean that only a limited numberof soldiers and sailors would take part in each, which would spoil theimpressiveness of the ceremony. The route generally taken by military processions was familiar to all Londoners of every quarter,and was consecrated by tradition.Lord Curzon suggested that the Military Procession might beheld on one Saturday in July, and the Naval Display on anotherSaturday.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) Thanksgiving Services should be held throughout the kingdom, and, if possible, throughout the Empire, on sunday, the 6th July, Lord Curzon to consult the variousauthorities concerned in regard to the necessary arrange-ments.(b.) The National Celebrations of Peace should take place on one day, the 19th July, and should comprise, if possible,a Military Procession of representatives of all the Fighting-Services, together with an American contingent, and aBiver Display, the whole day to be given up to organisednational rejoicings.
until the Commission had given a decision. To raise the rates wouldcertainly make a very considerable increase in the price of somegoods ; on the other hand, it might be possible to temper publichostility to the proposal by lowering the passenger fares at the sametime.A great deal could be done by organising a proper road transport system with the motor lorries in the hands of the Ministryof Munitions, the War Office, and the Air Ministry, and also byorganising a pool of railway wagons out of the surplus wagons inFrance.Lord Inverforth interposed to say that there were in thiscountry 9,000 wagons which could be pooled, and 5,000 in France.Sir Auckland Geddes, continuing, said that it would be adifferent matter if the Ways and Communications Bill could be passed into law within the next fortnight, but it was impossible formatters to continue as at present. A very bad block on the railwayswas inevitable in the next few weeks unless the matter was ,taken inhand promptly. The alternative to the proposal to raise rates wasto charter boats and use them for coastwise traffic.Sir Norman LJ ill said that there was another alternative. InApril 1918 power was given to the Board of Trade, under theDefence of the B.ealm Regulation 7, B (1), K, to issue an Order for enabling Railway Companies to refuse to accept goods for cariageby rail where other means of transport existed, subject to suchconditions as might be prescribed by the Order. He had pressed forthe exercise of this power up till October 1918, and the Board ofTrade had in fact drafted an Order. When the Armistice came the pressure on the Railway Companies was considerably relaxed andthe matter was allowed to drop. He suggested that this order should now be enforced, in order to compel traders to send goods by sea in relief of the railways. There was a very great congestion of cargo at the moment in London and Liverpool ; 70,000 tons ofbacon were now on their way to Liverpool, and a further heavyconsignment was to follow. In the existing conditions it couldnot be moved from the port, and during the hot weather he didnot see how it was possible to avoid foodstuffs spoiling on thequayside. It would be possible in practice to charter ships forcoastwise traffic. Ships chartered by the Government could carryGovernment cargoes, but they could not discriminate between the cargoes of private traders and select which they should carry.Sir Auckland Geddes doubted whether it would be practicable to put it in the hands of a Department to say that certain trafficshould be carried on the railways at a subsidised rate, and that othertraffic must be sent by sea at a non-subsidised rate.Sir Norman Hill pointed out that it had been done successfullyup till 1918. In point of fact, the alternative was frequently whethergoods should be carried by rail or should not be carried at all.The Prime Minister pointed out that now the war was over itwas not possible to exert the same pressure to induce the. public to accept drastic restrictions to meet an emergency, and enquire whether it would not be possible to charter coastwise shipping as atemporary expedient until the Ways and Communications Billbecame law.. The Shipping Controller was of opinion that it was not prac-ticable to charter coastwise shipping. For two years he had beenurging the importance of the question under consideration. he understood that railway traffics were being run at a loss of 60 percent., and suggested that the rates should be increased to bring them up to the actual cost of carriage. He was not satisfied that therewere no powers under the Defence of the Realm Act. It would bebetter to make the increase now under the Act rather than for theMinistry of Ways and Communications to incur the odium of doing soimmediately after it was set up. Naturally all traders sought tosend their goods by the cheapest route while the railway companies
continued to accept traffic regardless of their ability to deliver it, withthe result that delay and congestion were inevitable. One of themost serious factors was the absolute indifference of railway companiesthemselves. There was no competition and they did not carewhether they carried goods or not.Sir Philip Nash pointed out that if the railway rates were raised under the Defence of the Realm Act, a single appeal to theRailway and Canal Commissioners can have the effect of holding up the enforcement of the new rate against anybody affectedpending the decision of the Commissioners on the case submittedto them.The Prime Minister pointed out that it would be very difficultto get through Parliament a special Bill to raise railway rates. Itwould be no quicker and no less contentious than the passing of the ways and Communications Bill. There was a direct conflict betweenthe President of the Board of Trade and the Minister of Shipping asto whether the Defence of the Realm Act could be used for raisingrailway rates. He suggested that the matter should be referredimmediately to the Law Officers for their opinion on the point.The War Cabinet decided (a.) That the Ministry of Munitions should as soon as possibleobtain from the War Office (l) all railway wagons andlocomotives, both in this country and in France, surplus to army requirements, and should allocate them to therailway companies on hire terms to be approved by theTreasury; (2) all motor lorries, both in this country andin France, surplus to army requirements, for the purposeof organising a. system of road transport.(b.) That the Minister of Munitions and the President of theBoard of Trade should agree between themselves as towhether the system of road transport to be set up under(1) and (2) above should be under the control of theRoad Transport Board or under a separate organisation to be set up by the Minister of Munitions.(c.) That the Ministry of Munitions should direct the attentionof the War Office to the urgeirt necessity of recallingfrom France at the earliest possible moment the transportmaterial referred to in (1) above.(d.) That the President of the Board of Trade should obtain theopinion of the Law Officers within the following 48hours as to whether there were power under the Defenceof the Realm Act to raise railway rates for the carriage of goods, and should confer with the Chairman of thePort and Transit Executive in regard to the exercise ofthe power given to the Board of Trade by the Defence ofthe Realm Regulation 7 B (1) K to issue an order enablingRailway Companies to refuse to accept goods for carriageby rail where other means of transport existed.Demobilisation of 4. With reference to War Cabinet 582, Minute 2, the Warthe Ministry of Cabinet had before them two Memoranda by the Food ControllerFoocL (Papers G.T.-7511 &amp; 7175) relating to the demobilisation of theMinistry of Food.The Food Controller said that the War Cabinet had consideredhis Memorandum (G.T.-7175) on the 5 th May (War Cabinet. 562,Minute 1), and had then reached a decision in favour of breaking upthe Ministry and distributing such permanent items of work as would remain among the various Departments. Even before the1st May, however, a tendency to an increase of world prices of certain articles of food was already showing itself, and some private traderswere experiencing difficulty in obtaining adequate supplies.   This
tendency had been accentuated. As a consequence there was anundoubted reaction of public opinion in favour of control. If theWar Cabinet now decided that the Food Minister was to continuetemporarily, it could only be done on the following conditions : &apos;(a.) The Food Control Department must be empowered to tradein food and must be expected and permitted by theTreasury and the traders freely to exercise this power.(6.) The Food Control Department must be able to obtainabsolute priority of shipping space for adequate suppliesof food, whether bought by it or by private traders.(c.) The Government must be prepared, if necessary, to grantsubsidies on food in order to keep prices at a reasonablelevel.(d.) The Ministry of Food must forthwith be removed from the category of departments subject to demobilisation, andmust be freed from all pressure to demobilise and toreduce staff, such as is now being exercised by theTreasury and the Minister of Reconstruction.The Prime Minister said that the food situation was undoubtedly serious. Pie had consulted the Food Ministers ofother countries and was convinced that the position might become very difficult indeed. There was no doubt that, if the national and international organisation for the control of prices was with-drawn, the cost of articles would be rushed up by competition for supplies. Pie was glad that the Cabinet had concluded, when this subject was last discussed, that it was undesirable to contemplate a withdrawal of control.The President of the Board of Agriculture said that this wasalso the view of the farmers, who were alive to the danger ofsoaring prices. Pie thought, however, that if food prices werecontrolled the price of feeding stuffs and cereals should be controlled also.The Shipping Controller said that, so far as he could judge byreturns, the food position of this country was remarkably good. Hethought the Food Controller had little reason to fear on the score ofshipping, provided that the ports could be cleared satisfactorily. Hehad little anxiety with regard to tonnage and expected a full supplythis year. Since the Armistice l,000,0u0 tons of wheat had beenbrought from Australia.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was vital to thefinance of this country that the wheat in Australia should be lifted. He had already been obliged to urge the Food controller to avoid buying dear meat and wheat in the North Americanmarkets, and he wished to press on the Shipping Controller thesupreme importance of bringing cargoes from Australia and NewZealand.* The Prime Minister thought that everything should be done to avoid making Australia feel that she came second after theUnited States.The Food Controller said that there was one matter on whichhe would like the Chancellors sjmipathetic attention, and : that wasthe question of staffing the Ministry of Food. If the Ministry wasto continue on a temporary basis, it would be all the more difficult tokeep their employes, and it would be necessary to offer specialinducements to retain their services. He hoped the Treasury wouldtake a liberal view of this matter.The Chancellor said that he was quite willing to do all he could to meet the Food Controller on this question. Plis department had very properly been working on the assumption that food control was to terminate, but he had made satisfactory arrangements to meet the new situation in a Conference with Mr. Roberts last
Friday.   Mr. Roberts explained that his Memoranda were writtenand circulated before that Conference.The War Cabinet decided  That the Food Ministry should continue for the present with full powers, and that the Food Controller should make hisarrangements accordingly.International Food 5. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theControl Food Controller (Paper G.T.-7514) relating to International food control, in which he stated that Mr. Hoover in a Memorandum had expressed the opinion that there was no need to continue after the signature of peace, or at any rate after the coming harvest, any international arrangements for the purchase and control of foodstuffs.It was clear that America would wish to stand out of any arrange-ment and would not be willing to limit its producers&apos; prices, and thatthe utmost that could now be contemplated was the maintenance ofsome form of co-operation between the various purchasing countries.The Memorandum added that in the opinion of the Commissions and supply Branches of the Ministry and of the Treasury&quot; and theMinistry of Shipping it was distinctly contrary to the economic interests of this country to continue any arrangement for inter-national purchasing.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he objected topurchasing on joint account for subsequent distribution between thedifferent countries. He had no objection, however, to co-operationbetween the various international bodies, but at the present timesupplies were purchased by this country in the first instance, and america objected when, e.g., France repaid us in dollars what wehad spent in dollars on her account. The United States Treasurysaid some time ago that they would only allow France to makeone more repayment of their debt to us in dollars, but as aresult of his threatening to take drastic action the United states treasury had now agreed that we should be given time to windup our account with France on the condition that the UnitedStates had the right if she chose to forbid France to repay us in dollars. He was opposed to this country now making purchases onbehalf of the Allies, as such arrangements inevitably involved usin trouble with the United States Treasury.Lord Robert Cecil said that, with regard to the purchase of oil-seeds, he understood that nothing was bought on behalf of Italy orFrance until they had provided the money. He thought this systemmight be adopted in the case of other purchases. In his opinion itwould be a dangerous policy to dispense with all international actionin regard to food purchases. He did not agree with those people who said that we could afford to stand aside economically and letother countries go to pieces. This was the attitude at first adoptedby America which had brought forth such strong protests from our-selves, and if we were going to urge America to see the present crisisthrough, we must ourselves take some of the risk. He aoreed thatcare should be taken to prevent this country being placed in aninferior bargaining position as compared with the United States.He was in favour of a review of the different international organisa-tions now in existence to see whether they could not be betteradapted to present conditions, and this was in fact now being doneby the Supreme Economic Council.The Prime Minister said that the Council of Three had discussed this question, and the United States had been in favour of bringinginternational control to an end. They had agreed, however, to consultation, provided that such consultation was not confined tothe Allies alone, but included neutral and enemy countries.The President of the Board of Agriculture said that we shouldgain considerably by consulting neutrals.
Lord Robert Cecil said that he would like the problemconsidered from the point of view of joint purchase. Some people were of the opinion that the world supply of cereals was adequate.If this was the case, there would be no object in joint purchase, butif there was a shortage of cereals, he was of the opinion that jointpurchase would be an advantage.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that joint purchase couldonly be carried out satisfactorily by one individual buying for all.He thought that it would be to the good, however, if some agreement could be arrived at by which countries purchasing in any particularmarket were limited in the amount bought and the price paid for supplies.The War Cabinet decided : To adjourn the discussion until the proposals of the supreme economic Council were forthcoming.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,July 1, 1919.o
