2The Coal Strike. 1. With reference to War Cabinet 597, Minute 1, the WarCabinet had before them four reports on the situation in Yorkshireby Sir Eric Geddes (Papers U.C.-9, 10, 11, and 12).. The Minister of Labour said that his information was to theeffect that Mr. Herbert Smith, the President of the Yorkshire.Miners&apos; Association, had made a pacific speech at a meeting of the yorkshire District Council. The feeling of the younger miners in yorkshire was that the abandonment of the pumps was the onlymethod of bringing the situation to a head, although the older menwere against this course. There was a general feeling now that thepumps should be worked, and it was hoped the pumpmen would return shortly. The Yorkshire dispute was receiving no&apos; support from the other coalfields. In South Wales the men were still atwork, and in Lancashire they were about to return. The strikes inNottinghamshire and Derbyshire were on issues not connected withpiece-rate awards. With regard to the situation of the pits in yorkshire, six had been entirely flooded, and the owners were quitecontent that this should be so, as these were unprofitable pits towork. Seventeen were getting into a dangerous condition, and itwas thought that the assistance of the naval ratings was being obtained to keep the pumps going. Mr. Herbert Smith had told hismen not to interfere with the naval ratings. Sir Robert Homeadded that the coalowners were very anxious that Sir Eric Geddesshould see Mr. Herbert Smith with regard to the 14&apos;3 per cent., as some of the owners were in favour of this increase being givenin full.The President of the Board of Trade said that the Miners&apos;Federation had had a long discussion on piece rates at Keswick, andhe understood (through Mr. Hartshorn) that they had decided thata 10 per cent, increase for all pits was all they could ask for, withthe exception of Lancashire and Cheshire, which they consideredshould have 12&apos;2 per cent., and Yorkshire something like 12&apos;1 percent. In South Wales only did they consider the rise should be asmuch as 14-3 per cent. Mr. Hartshorn had informed him thatMr. Smillie had compelled the Lancashire delegates to return toLancashire and inform the men that they had got to take 12&quot;2 percent. There was another feature in the situation, regarding thepumpmen who were not members of the Miners&apos; Federation, as distinct from those pumpmen who were members. These men werebeing intimidated, and had decided that they would not return tothe mines until they had been paid their wages for the days on whichthey had been compelled not to work by the Yorkshire Association.If this claim was not met, and the men came out on strike after theminers had returned, it would result in a more difficult situationthan the present one. These pumpmen were of the opinion that theminers should be made to&apos;pay their wages, but so long as they were paid, whether by the owners or by the Government, he did not think they would mind.The Minister of Labour said that these men had manygrievances against the Miners&apos; Federation, one of which was thatthe Federation had refused to sit on the Sankey commission with them.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he understood fromthe Minister of Labour that the two Yorkshire Owners&apos; Associationswished, to give way to the men and award them the 14&apos;3 per cent, forpiece rates. This looked like an invitation to the Government togo back on its decision. Such a course would condemn the Govern-ment utterly and destroy its power to deal with further troubles.The Prime Minister said that it would create a serious position if the owners advised the Government to grant the 14&apos;3 per cent., asthe fact that such advice had been given was bound, sooner or later,- to be made public.The Chancellor of the Exchequer observed that such advice wason a subject in which the owners had ceased to have any pecuniaryinterest.
3 WC5   rThe Minister of Labour said that the Scottish and South Walesminers were against the 14-3 per cent., and he believed only a fewminers in Lancashire, Yorkshire, and Warwickshire supported thedemand.The Prime Minister said that such an advance would mean 6d.or Is. extra on to the price of coal, which the country could not possibly afford. As the Chancellor of the Exchequer had observed,ix, was all very well for the masters to advise the giving of this concession, but the money would not come out of their pockets.The Secretary of State for War said that, with regard to thegeneral situation, he had received a private letter from the GeneralOfficer Commanding, Northern Command, in which he stated thatthe liaison with Sir Eric Geddes was working very well. troops had been sent from Clipstone to Wakefield, Pontefract, and Leeds.He proposed to reinforce Clipstone Camp by one of the brigades frOrnthe fihine Army.The Food Controller said that, with regard to the strike of theCo-operative Societies&apos; employees, he was able to report that theywere returning to work pending negotiations.Nationalisation of 2. The   Cabinet had some discussion   on the desirability of mines, making a statement regarding the nationalisation of. mines.The Prime Minister said that Mr. Smillie was coming to see himon the following day, and he would probably ask if the Governmentwas able to give him any information regarding nationalisation.The Prime Minister said that he was inclined to think that there was nothing to be gained by putting off a decision. The previous evening he had dined with seventeen or eighteen Members of Parliament,mostly Coalition Liberals, and he had asked them their views onnationalisation, and with one exception they had all been against it,though they were in favour of the nationalisation of the railways.These gentlemen were, however, agreed that the miners should havea voice in the management of the mines, and they were in favour ofthe nationalisation of royalties and minerals. He thought it wouldbe wise to make a statement on the subject before the recess, but ifthese strikes continued it gave the Government very little time toconsider such a weighty question.. Should there be a strike on thesubject of nationalisation, he thought it would be better to have itin August than three months later. He was interviewing some ofthe mine-owners shortly, with a view to an interchange of opinionson this subject, and he would like the authority of the Cabinet topress these owners to give representation to the men in the manage-ment of the mines. The Prime Minister said that there was one other subject on which he would like to make a statement to theHouse before the recess, which was, the trade,policy of the country.The Members of Parliament with whom he had dined on the previous -night had also pressed him to make a statement on the action theGovernment proposed to take regarding profiteering. Thesegentlemen favoured drastic and dramatic measures.The Minister of Health observed that, while the government did not possess the confidence of the miners, unless a statement onnationalisation was made, they would lose the confidence of thegeneral public also.It was generally agreed that a statement on the subject of nationalisation was desirable before the recess, in view of the factthat, if a strike was to come, the best month in which to have it wasAugust.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The Prime Minister, in his interview with Mr. Smillie onthe following day, should inform him that the Govern-ment would make a statement of their policy onnationalisation before the recess ;
Xtis 6X-K3.is6r.Visit of H.E.H. the prince of Wales tothe United States.The Prime Minister, when interviewing the coal-owners,should urge them to concede representation for the menin the management of the mines.3. The Cabinet had a short discussion regarding the venue ofthe trial of the ex-Kaiser.   -The Prime Minister agreed that London was not a very suitableplace, and it had been his intention, in his speech on the subject, tosay that it would take place in England.The relative advantages of Hampton Court and Dover were discussed.The Acting Secretary of State for^ Foreign Affairs made thesuggestion of the Channel Islands.4. With reference to War Cabinet 589, Minute 1, the ActingSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs reported that the UnitedStates Ambassador entirely approved of the proposal that the prince of Wales should be lodged on his own battleship during his visit to new York. This would relieve the United States of the difficultyof finding a suitable residence, and would have the additionaladvantage of enabling His Royal Highness to return hospitality.The War Cabinet approved this proposal, and agreed that animmediate announcement should be made regarding the prince of Wales&apos; visit to the United States.The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign affairs undertook to set in motion the arrangements he had agreed on with Lord Stamfordham for this purpose.Eussia.Situation in North 5  Tjie prime Minister said he wished to draw the attention ofthe War Cabinet to the most recent developments in North Russia, asrevealed by two telegrams from General Ironside, which had just been received. The first stated that Onega had been handed overto the Bolsheviks, after a mutiny. The railway position was thesame, Russian troops being disarmed in parties as the British arrive.The state of the Russian troops was such that his efforts to consoli-date the Russian national army must now be regarded definitely asa failure. Unless the British force at Archangel was to be increased,it was essential that evacuation be carried out with the least possible delay. The telegram expressed the hope that the naval contingentin North Russia might at once be increased by two large warships,to admit of landing parties in the town so as to release soldiers forfighting. In conclusion, General Ironside asked whether he was to commence the evacuating of any civilian population, as, if it wasdecided that this must be done, a start should be made as early aspossible.In the second telegram General Ironside said that he had discussed the situation with General Miller, who agreed with him that it would not be possible for the Russians to hold on to Archangelduring the winter if the British troops were withdrawn. Thesituation was difficult, as he had to stabilise each front with Britishtroops, and, with the river in its present state, movement was slow.Monitors were standing by and bombarding the enemy, who was notin great strength. The tactical situation might demand a withdrawalon the Dwina and Vaga. All preparations were being made for anevacuation slowly down the river, if the situation required it. Asregards holding on during the winter, and the number of Britishtroops required to do it, the safety of Archangel depended so much on the situation in the rest of Russia that General Ironside could notestimate exactly what the requirements would be. He thought hecould hold practically what he had now without danger, with the:
WC 598troops he had at present, provided that the odds against him were no greater than they had been the previous - year. The position,however, would always be one of active defensive only.The Prime Minister said that the telegrams left upon him theimpression of a strong man, who was not afraid to face facts. Theyundoubtedly revealed a very serious position. It was clear thatGeneral Ironside contemplated the possibility of remaining on intothe winter. The first thing to be done was to eradicate this idea atonce. The Cabinet had some time ago definitely decided that our troops must be withdrawn before the winter set in.The Secretary of State for War said that the War Office had no intention of letting General Ironside remain on, and they would take steps to remove his misapprehensions at once.The Pirst Lord of the Admiralty said that the best men that could be sent to General Ironside&apos;s assistance would be a finebattalion of Marines, which it had been proposed to send to Schleswig-Holstein, but had been retained in England for the present onaccount of the Labour situation.The Acting-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointed outthat the situation in North Russia had changed since the cabinet had reached the decision referred to by the Prime Minister. At thattime they had contemplated that when our troops withdrew theywould leave behind them a local Russian Government. It was clearnow, however, that directly we evacuated Archangel, the TchaikovskiGovernment would fall, and the Bolsheviks take its place.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he and some of hiscolleagues, when the Cabinet had approved of General Ironside&apos;plans for an offensive, had viewed the whole proposal with gravemisgivings, and the possible political advantages to be derived fromthis action had not convinced them. They had yielded to strong pressure on the part of the military authorities, who had represented(a) that a strong forward movement was necessary to render theevacuation a safe operation ; and (b) that, if we could hold on until theriver froze, the Tchaikovski Government could maintain itself duringthe winter. In both cases the ground had now been cut away fromunder our feet, and there was no reason for our troops remaining aa day longer than was necessary. We had, however, to consider thequestion of evacuating the local population, and he wished to knowexactly what our obligations were in this respect.The Secretary of State for War said that the British troops hadbeen in Archangel before he took over his present appointment. he desired, however, that the position of the War Office in regard tothis situation should be clearly understood. They had neverdiverged from their plan, which was to evacuate those troops assoon as possible. We only maintained in North Russia a force justsufficiently large to ensure a safe withdrawal. That withdrawalmight now have been completed had it not been decided to acceptGeneral Ironside&apos;s plan, for reasons stated by the Chancellor.When this plan had been before the Cabinet, Admiral Koltchak&apos;position had been so good that &quot;the War Office felt bound to seizewhat appeared to be a most favourable opportunity to establish ajunction with him and set up a secure local Government.Unfortunately, these hopes had not been realised, so we had now to revert to our original intention of evacuating as soon as possible.The last chance of saving the Archangel Government had gone. he did not think, however, that the general strategic situation inRussia had undergone any great change. It was quite clear now that General Ironside&apos;s plan to strike the Bolsheviks a heavy blowwas sound, and it was to be regretted that he had been.unable tobring it off. The Russians at Archangel knew perfectly well thatwe intended to withdraw, and they&apos;must now realise that, when wewent, they must endeavour to make the best terms they could withthe Bolsheviks. The Government, he thought, had taken a wisecourse in announcing to Parliament their intention of evacuating.
In any case, concealment would have been impossible, as we had to promise the troops already there that they would be brought back,and, further, we had to give a pledge to other troops, volunteeringto go out and relieve them, that they would be withdrawn before thewinter. In his opinion, it was quite evident that we must beprepared to evacuate a certain number of the local population. Wecould not, of course, allow Russians who bad fought for us to bemurdered, and he suggested that, we should offer to repatriate themto South Russia, where they could join General Denikin. He hadon the previous day seen a British officer who had just retmmedfrom Archangel^ who strongly urged that the idea of maintaining aBritish Military Mission there during the winter should be abandoned,as their throats would certainly all be cut.The Prime Minister reminded the War Cabinet that our policy,when we first decided to land troops at Archangel, was to assist ourRussian friends against the Germans. We had then had to remain on in order to protect Russian troops, and others who were stillloyal to the Entente, against the Bolsheviks. It was most fortunate that Admiral Koltchak&apos;s recent, operations had definitelyfailed. It was clear to him that Koltchak&apos;s present advisersattached no importance to the Archangel Government. Archangelpossessed no population, no railways, no resources. For this reason it was unlikely that the Bolsheviks would pay very much attentionto it, as South Russia where minerals, oil, &amp;c, were found inprofusion would prove a more powerful magnet. He thought thatthe War Office, in replying to General Ironside&apos;s telegrams, shouldremove any apprehension he might have about the possibility of hisstaying on into the winter, and should also inform him that ourhonour was involved in saving as many of our Russian friends as wecould. For the rest, he thought we had no reason at all to reproachourselves. We had given Koltchak, Denikin, Archangel, and theRussians generally, every possible chance of saving themselves fromthe Bolsheviks, and this we had been compelled to undertake single-handed. We alone had supplied troops, munitions, and money,while the French had only contributed promises.The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought that the situation in siberia, to judge from General Knox&apos;s telegrams, was just as serious as, or even more serious than, that in Archangel. As regardsthe evacuation of the civil population, he thought the time had come when we should tell them that we could not undertake tocontinue to feed and finance them after they have been withdrawnfrom North Russia. As the Prime Minister had stated, the whole burden of assisting the Russian people to escape from Bolshevisttyranny had been borne by ourselves. It was an unfortunate thing that none of those we were assisting had ever taken our advice in military or political matters.The Acting-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that inMarch last the number of people, other than British, whom we might have to evacuate from Russia amounted to some 18,000 ;that is to say^ 9,000 of the local population, 4,000 Poles, Letts,Lithuanians, &amp;c, and 5,000 locally enlisted Russian troops. he proposed to telegraph to our representative at Archangel to enquirewhat his most recent estimate was of the numbers to whom we were under an obligation in this respect. It would not be difficult to repatriate the Poles, Lithuanians and others,, as their countries werecontiguous to Russia. The repatriation of the Russians was mainlya matter of shipping. There were two classes of Russians to beconsidered ; those who had fought with us, but many of whom had since mutinied, and the ordinary population.The Secretary of State for War thought it was quite probablethat in the course of the next two months the whole Koltchakmovement would crumple to pieces, unless the Japanese and theUnited States went to his rescue, and the Bolsheviks would thenbe able to concentrate towards the south.   The repercussion of a
succession of misfortunes was bound to have an effect on, and might even overwhelm, Denikin. He wished our policy in regard to russia had been more clearly defined. Mr. Churchill said that he regretted that the Chief of the Imperial General Staff was unable to be present that day, but he hoped to bring him with him to-morrow orthe following day to the War Cabinet, when they would submitconsidered proposals to meet the present situation.The Shipping Controller said that he understood that altogetherhe would be required to find shipping for not less than 50,000 mento be withdrawn from Archangel.   This number included Britishtroops and the local population.   The shipping situation was already very serious, and it would be greatly accentuated if he had to providefor the repatriation of any considerable numbers of Russians to the crimea.   All shipping was  not suitable for this purpose, and itwould probably be necessary to withdraw vessels from the Atlanticservices.   It would mean that the repatriation of Canadians andAustralians would   be   interrupted.    His   Department   could,   hethought, furnish the necessary shipping, provided they were told atonce   exactly   thfi   numbers   for whom accommodation would benecessary, and where they must be sent.   The position was renderedthe more serious by the threat of a possible strike in Liverpool.The War Cabinet decided-Co.) That the Acting-Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should ascertain from our representative at Archangelthe exact numbers of friendly troops and inhabitantswhom we were under an obligation to evacuate, withspecial reference to the minimum number of Russians tobe repatriated to the Black Sea.. (b.) That   the   War   Office,  in   reply   to   General Ironside&apos;stelegrams, should make it absolutely clear to him thatthere was no intention whatsoever of the British Govern-ment departing from its decision to evacuate Archangelbefore the winter set in.At a later stage in the meeting the First, Lord of the Admiraltyinformed the War Cabinet that his Naval Advisers were being pressed by the War Office to send a battalion of Marines to Archangelwithout delay. Arrangements would be made for these men to startwithin forty-eight hours, if the Government authorised their despatch.His Department were assured that the Liverpool men who had struckwould resume work at once if they could be told that by loading theships they would be helping to bring our men back from Russia. Ifthe War Cabinet authorised the despatch of the Marines, thenecessary shipping would have to be provided.This question was reserved until the further discussion whenthe Chief of the Imperial General Staff would be present.government machinery for trade and commerce.6. The War Cabinet had under consideration the Report of theCommittee, established by War Cabinet 553, Minute 4, to examinethe question of Government machinery for dealing with trade and commerce (Paper G.-253).Lord Cave, the Chairman of the Committee, stated that theenquiry of the Committee had been devoted to the machinery for thedevelopment of British trade abroad. The Committee had investi-gated the matter thoroughly, their principal object being to further the development of British trade in foreign countries. He had started the investigation with a bias in favour of the-point of viewput forward by the President of the Board of Trade, but the Com-mittee found, from the evidence before them, that there was a very strong feeling amongst commercial men against the proposal that theDepartment of Overseas Trade should be abolished or absorbed intothe Board of Trade.   It was admitted that the Consular Service
must remain under the Foreign Office, and it would be impossible,without the existence of the Department of Overseas Trade as a link between the Foreign Office and the Board of Trade, to keep upa proper connection between the representatives of the BritishGovernment abroad and the Departments at home concernedwith trade questions. The Committee were of opinion thatthe Department of Overseas Trade should be continued and strengthened.. The fact that it had at its head an Under-Secretary able to devote his whole time to foreign commerce wouldenable it to do a great deal for British trade abroad. There wasno dotibt that the accommodation occupied by the department had been disgraceful. It had been scattered through half-a-dozenbuildings in different parts of London, and had not had a fair chance.The Department necessarily had in its register minutes and docu-ments which both of the parent Departments desired to see, and itwas essential that it should be in close proximity to the Board ofTrade and the Foreign Office, and, if possible, that all three departments should be under the same roof.The President of the Board of Trade said that he did not think the solution proposed by the Committee would be satisfactory. Thework of regulating public services was in process of being taken away from the Board of Trade, and the functions remaining to it would all be of a/commercial nature, of which by far the most important wouldbe those relating to overseas trade, which were inseparably linked up with questions of export. It was impossible to separate exportquestions from questions of internal trade. While he would not saythat with good-will the scheme proposed by the Committee couldnot be made to work, he was of opinion that it was bad in principle,and wasteful. He agreed that the main difficulty was the geo-graphical separation of the Department of Overseas Trade from theBoard of Trade! On the other hand, he believed that the realsolution was not to set up the Department of Overseas Trade as a link under the same roof as the Foreign Office and the Board ofTrade, but simply to house the Foreign Office and the Board ofTrade together.&apos; The dual allegiance owed by the parliamentary under-Secretary at the head of the&quot; Department of Overseas trade would necessarily be very difficult to achieve in practice. In any event, he agreed with the recommendation of the Committee that machinery should be set up for close consultation between the ForeignOffice and the Board of Trade. The, proposed Standing Council he regarded as absolutely essential, whether the Department of OverseasTrade were continued or not. The principal need, however, was toget proper accommodation. If the Department of Overseas trade were to continue in a different building, the Board of Trade wouldbe artificially split up. The staff concerned with its most importantfunctions would be housed in a different building and would not be known under the name of the Board of Trade at all. The staff ofthe Department of Overseas Trade would be larger than that of theBoard of Trade, and the latter, being robbed of its principal functions,would be placed in an invidious position.. The Prime Minister pointed out that, under the recommenda-tions of the Committee, questions of commercial policy would still bein the hands of the Board of Trade.The Acting-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs observed thatit was remarkable that the Committee had expressed a broad general opinion in favour of the Department of Overseas Trade. He wasastonished at the almost complete consensus of commercial opinion in favour of the control of foreign commercial policy being under-taken by the Foreign Office. Three members of the Committee-were in favour of continuing the Department of Overseas Trade,while the only dissentient member went even further and desired the transfer of the supervision of foreign commerce to the ForeignOffice. In view of the opinion of the majority of the Committeehe did not propose to argue the case in favour of the suggestions, put
forward in the Minority Report, for the transfer of the Departmentof Overseas Trade to the Foreign Office. He was of opinion,however, &quot;that the Government, having referred the matter to aCommittee upon which the commercial community were so largelyrepresented, would have great difficulty in refusing to adopt theirreport. He gathered from the concluding remarks of the Presidentof the Board of Trade that the latter was prepared to accept thesolution proposed by the Committee.The President of the Board of Trade interposed that that was so, provided the question of accommodation could be satisfactorilysettled.Mr. Bonar Law said that he also had started with a strongprejudice in favour of the Board of Trade case, which he retained,but. as the Cabinet had submitted the matter to the Committee,which had sent in a strong report, he thought that they were boundto give the new scheme a trial.The Minister of Health said that he was entirely in agreementwith the President of the Board of Trade. In his opinion the Com-mittee had been influenced, in coming to their conclusion, by awrong idea of the functions of the Board of Trade as a purelyregulating and controlling Department.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he was in agreementwith the President of the Board of Trade.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in his opinion, thescheme proposed by the Committee was unsound, but he felt that hecould not advise the Government to reject the report of so strong aCommittee with so powerful a backing of commercial opinion behind it. He regarded it as of importance that commercial policy should be controlled by the Board of Trade, and in his experience the lateDirector of Overseas Trade had not always expressed the mind ofthe President of the Board of Trade on questions of policy. H e hadparticularly in mind the case of a scheme for developing trade with roumania.Lord Cave pointed out that the scheme in question had been drawn up by a high official in the Board of Trade, and that theDepartment of Overseas Trade could not be held responsible if ithad not received the sanction of the President.The Director of Overseas Trade observed that the ideal con-ception would be that the offices of the President of the Board ofTrade and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should beunited in the same person, but that was manifestly impossible.Under the new scheme the President of the Board of Trade wouldlay down the lines of trade policy. It would be impossible, however,to dispense with the Department of Overseas Trade as a bridgebetween the Foreign Office and the Board of Trade unless theConsuls were taken away from the Foreign Office.Mr. Bonar Law thought that it was not possible to reject thescheme. It was not enough to say that the Department of OverseasTrade should be absorbed by the Board of Trade. Some provision must be made for the supervision of the work of the Consuls. he believed that the proposal would work satisfactorily, provided theDirector of Overseas Trade realised that he was an Under-Secretaryresponsible to both Departments, and did not ally himself especially to one or other of the Departments.The President&apos;&apos; of the Board of Trade agreed that it was obviously impossible to reject the scheme without proposinganything in its place. If the Cabinet decided to accept the Report,he pressed very strongly that the separate establishment of theDepartment of Overseas Trade should be done away with, and thatthe members of the staff should be carried on one or other of the votes of the two parent Departments. That he believed to be absoulutely necessary. A separate establishment tended to provoke a suspicion of aggression and to create ill-feeling in matters of promotion.   There would   be  no  difficulty   in conceding to theD
Director of Overseas Trade the full control of any members of his staff seconded from the Board of. Trade. If the Department hada separate vote, the President would have no say in the appointmentof the staff. He was not inclined- to be responsible for trade policyunless he had a say in the appointment of the higher officials of theDepartment. He had not been consulted in such matters in thepast. He regarded this as vital to the effective co-ordination ofpolicy in trade and industry. He was . prepared to accept therecommendations of the Committee so long as the separate votewas not maintained. Otherwise, there was no certainty that hewould know what was being done in the Department of&quot; OverseasTrade.Lord Cave thought that it would be dangerous to prevent thestaff of the Department of Overseas Trade from developing anindependent existence, with the resultant esprit de corps. He hopedthat the President of the Board of Trade would not insist upon this.The Department had done exceedingly good work, and was coveringground not hitherto covered by anybody. It had the support of thecommercial world, and he suggested that if the President of theBoard of Trade would give the scheme a fair chance for two or threeyears, he would find that it would tend to gravitate in commercial matters towards the Board of Trade. *.The Permament Secretary to the Board of Trade said that he attached more importance, from the point of view of administration,to the abolition of the separate establishment of the Departmentthan to any other matter. A body of civil servants was growing up,who were neither on the strength of the Foreign Office nor of theBoard of Trade, although the Department to which they belongedwas not, in fact, an independent department. That could only leadeventually to the growth of a spirit of separation.Mr. Bonar Law observed that, if the members of the staff of theDepartment of Overseas Trade were in fact Board of Trade officials,and.treated as such, the mere fact of there being a formal vote forthe Department would appear to make no difference. In his opinion,the House of Commons would want a separate Estimate, and wouldx-esent the splitting up of the vote for the Department between theForeign Office and the Board of Trade.The Prime Minister said that, as one who had&apos; considered its establishment as a doubtful experiment, he was very gratified to hear that the Department of Overseas Trade was giving satisfactionin commercial circles, and suggested that the scheme should beadopted as an experiment for a few months. With regard to thequestion of accommodation, the First Commissioner of Works mustbe consulted. The seventh recommendation of the Committee, thatthe Board of Trade should remain responsible for the general com-mercial policy, was very important, and should greatly strengthen the position of that Department.. The President of the Board of Trade said that the question of accommodation was a vital matter.The Director of Overseas Trade said that all the senior officials at present belonged either to the Foreign Office or the Board ofTrade, and he would not think of appointing anybody of his ownselection.The War Cabinet decided (a.) To approve the Report of the Committee as a provisionalscheme subject, to reconsideration if it should not befound to work satisfactorily after some months&apos;experience;(b.) That the separate establishment of the Department of overseas Trade should continue for the present, but should be brought up for further consideration in threemonths&apos; time.
Disposal of Canteen 7. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theProfits- Secretary of State for War (Paper G.T.-7595) on the subject of thedisposal of canteen profits, in which it was stated that the Army(.,&apos; Council had had under consideration the question of the ultimatedisposal of the large funds which had accumulated as a result ofcanteen trading during the war. Tt was estimated that these funds,which arose from various sources, amounted to over 10,500,OOOZ., ofwhich, after deducting that proportion which represented the profitsfrom purchases by Dominion, Colonial, and Indian troops, there remained approximately 8,000,00OZ. as the amount available inrespect of Imperial troops. The policy of the Army Council had been to conserve canteen and similar funds, with a view to their utilisationafter the war in the best interests of those who were.serving,or had served, and their dependants, and in view of the fact that thelarge majority of men who contributed as soldiers and sailors to theprofits of the canteens were now civilians, and that widows andchildren were to share in the benefit from canteen profits, it was feltthat the administration of such funds should not rest with the WarOffice, so far as they were concerned, but should be transferred to a 1central authority representative of all interests concerned. A draft scheme for administering the fund, giving the proposed constitutionof a central Council and a Board of Management representative of allinterests, was appended to the Memorandum.The War Cabinet also had under consideration a Memorandumon the same subject by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (paper g.T.-7764), in which attention was drawn to the following paragraphs from the Fifth Report of the Select Committee on national Expenditure : &quot; 10. The Navy and Army Canteens Board conducts ArmyCanteens on behalf of the Army Council. It is a tradingorganisation with a gross annual, turnover of some 20,000,0001.It is financed by a Treasury guarantee of 3,000,000Z;, but theBoard occupies a quasi-independent position; its accounts areaudited by its own auditors, and not by the Controller and auditor-General. Its receipts are derived, first, from theexpenditure in canteens of the 6^d. cash allowance granted to - -troops for messing over and above the ration issued in kind ;secondly, from the soldiers&apos; individual expenditure in canteens. %Ten per cent, of these receipts is given up by the Board,four-fifths of the 10 per cent, to the units, one-fifth to theCentral Regimental Institutes Fund. The question whetherthe profits derived from the expenditure of the 6^d. cashallowance belong to the public purse or not was reopened after only; 40,000Z. had been paid in respect of one quarter, and has notyet been decided. This is a matter proper for the considerationof the Public Accounts Committee, and pending their report upon it we have suspended our enquiry into the operations ofthe Board.&quot;11. A second question that arises in this connectionrelates to the Central Regimental Institutes Fund. It is a trust fund, vested in the Army Council, to be used for thebenefit of the soldier. At the end of the War it is likely to amount to several millions. Meantime, however, it forms partof the working capital of the Navy and Army CanteensBoard. The situation with respect to this fund needs further investigation on the part both of the War Office and of theTreasury. Among other considerations that should be borne inmind is the fact that before the War we had a smallprofessional Army; after the War our forces will be reduced to( whatever peace establishment it may be found necessary tomaintain ; during the years of war the Army has been expanded to include a great part of the adult manhood of the nation. It&apos;is from this vastly larger body that this fund has been drawn,
and the disposal of it should take these differences into account.We consider that, in any event, the House of Commons shouldhave cognizance of the grants made from time- to time from theCentral Regimental Institutes Fund, and of any proposals of      CJdealing with the accumulated balances at the end of the war.&quot;,. The Memorandum further stated that, while the Chancellor of theExchequer did not support the suggested claim of the public purseto any share in the profits of the canteens, he felt that the followingpoints required consideration : (1.) The claim of the ex-soldier to share.(2.) The claim of the House of Commons to be consulted.(3.) Representation of the Pensions Ministry on the central council.The First Lord of the Admiralty stated that the admiralty were taking steps to ascertain whether the men of the Fleet wished the Navy to join in the scheme.The War Cabinet decided To approve in principle the scheme put forward in theMemorandum of the Secretary of State for War (paper g.T.-7595); the details to be arranged in consultation between the Secretary of State for War and Air, theMinister of Labour and the Minister of Pensions.2, Whitehall Gardens, &amp;W.1,July 23, 1919.
