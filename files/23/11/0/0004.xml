With reference to War Cabinet 575, Minute 1, the Post-master-General said that now that Peace had been signed, he wished to raise again the question of the abolition of the censor-ship over cables. The agitation for its removal was growing everyday, and he had had representations from large merchants inManchester and elsewhere to the effect that their trade was beinggravely injured by the delay in receiving telegrams. The com-mercial part of the community were  ready during the war to
subordinate their interests to military needs, but now that the war was over traders felt that they should receive more consideration.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the Governmentcontinued to obtain most valuable information through the censor-ship. If the censorship was abolished this kind of information would not be available. He must therefore press in the strongestmanner for the retention of the powers now exercised.The Secretary of State for War said that he had fully dis-cussed this subject with his staff at the War Office, and as a resulthe had abandoned the hope that it was possible to keep up a selecrtive censorship. He did not think that he could contend thatcensorship should be retained after the ratification of Peace withGermany and the three Powers. He held strongly, however, thatit should be kept up until then, and that meanwhile the official secrets Amendments Bill should be passed through the House ofCommons. He understood that this Bill gave the Governmentalmost similar powers to those they now exercised, and wouldenable copies of all telegrams coming into this country to be avail-able for official purposes. Some discussion then followed as towhat the ratification of the Peace Treaty actually meant.Lord Curzon stated that the first ratification would be byGermany, and Mr. Balfour thought this would take place beforethe end of the month. When Germany had ratified the blockadewould be raised, and there was also a statement from Paris to theeffect that the censorship would simultaneously cease. Ratifica-tion by Germany would be followed by that of three signatoryPowers. He understood that as President Wilson would have togo before the United States Senate before the ratification of theTreaty, and as Italy had just changed her Government, it was probable that the three Powers who would ratify the Treaty onbehalf of the Allies would be Great Britain, France, and Japan.He did not see why any great interval should elapse betweenGerniany&apos;s ratification and that of the Allies. Therefore hethought the censorship might be continued until that event. In/\ the meantime, the Official Secrets Amendments Bill should be pressed forward.The Postmaster-General said that, as there was no doubt that peace would be ratified, he did not see why that event should notbe anticipated and the censorship abolished immediately.Mr. Bonar Law pointed out that it would be some time beforethe Official Secrets Amendments Bill could be passed by the Houseof Commons owing to the vast amount of business to be gotthrough before the end of the Session. He thought it possible thatin the meantime the Secretary of State for War. might continueto use the emergency powers he already possessed for obtainingcopies of all telegrams coming into the country.The Postmaster-General said that in the opinion of his legal advisers these powers could be so used, but there were legalopinions to the contrary.Lord Curzon said that it was desired to obtain copies of alltelegrams continuously, and not only in an emergency.\ Lord William Percy said that the Official Secrets Amend-ments Bill, if passed, would place the Government in the same position as the French Government, and would enable the Govern-ment to secure a copy of every telegram passing over the cables inthe United Kingdom sent to some central authority.The President of the Board of Trade said that the point was whether censorship should be abolished when Germanyratified the Peace Treaty, or on the Treaty&apos;s complete ratification.He had that morning received a deputation of eminent businessmeii, who had demanded the immediate removal of all censorshiprestrictions, as the position was well-nigh intolerable from a busi-ness point of view. The delay on the cables was much accentuated by the length of the War Office and India Office cablegrams.   In
Abolition of Pass-port Control.2. The Secretary of State for War said that he had another matter which was much akin to censorship, to which he wouldlike to draw the Cabinet&apos;s attention. He understood that the delegates in Paris had turned down, the idea of the passportcontrol of people entering into this country. This was a very grave decision, and meant that we should be unable to check theBolshevik and other agitators coming into the country.Mr. Bonar Law said that such a decision could &quot;not be taken without the sanction of this Government.Output of Guns for1919-20.3. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer relating to the output of guns for1919-1920 (Paper G.T.-7279).- addition, the abolition of the censorship would allow the use ofprivate codes.     &apos;Mr. Bonar Law said that he thought some time must elapse before this country could ratify the Peace Treaty, as a promisehad been given to the House of Commons that the passing of thetwo Bills introduced by the Prime Minister last Thursday wouldbe in effect our ratification. If the principle of abolition had beenaccepted, he could not see the justification of delaying it afterGermany had ratified the Treaty.The Secretary of State for War suggested that the date onwhich Paris considered the Treaty ratified should be the dateof the abolition of the censorship, and that from that date powers should be given to&apos;the Secretary of State to obtain copies of allcables coming into this country, and the opinion of the LawOfficers of the Crown should be sought as to whether these powersf were now possessed or whether it would be necessary to introduce/(   the Official Secrets AmendmentSBill to obtain them.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would like toknow if a staff would have to be maintained to go through all the telegrams coming into this country which it was now considered necessary should be placed at the disposal of the Government.Lord William Percy stated that none of the present Censor&apos;staff would be employed for any purpose, and that the expenses in connection with censorship would cease altogether.The War Cabinet decided -(a.) To abolish the censorship on the ratification of the peace treaty by Germany, on the assumption that the opinionof the Law Officers of the Crown was favourable to thesuggestion that a Secretary of State would continue toexercise emergency powers to secure copies of all tele-grams passing over cables in the United Kingdom.(&amp;.) To ask the Law Officers of the Crown whether the Post-master-General has power, at the instance of a Secre-tary of State, to compel the submission to him of copiesof all telegrams and cables received in or despatchedfrom this country; whether such power, if it exists, is limited to national emergencies or can be exercised in normal conditions; whether, if such power is limitedto national emergencies, the period from now to the ratification of peace can be regarded period ofnational emergency.(c.) That the Admiralty, the War Office, the Foreign Office,and the India Office should examine whether it waspossible to reduce the number and the length of cablesdespatched to the East.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that at the date of theArmistice the Ministry of Munitions appeared to have on order for the Army 2,500 of the new. 18-pr. guns, and it had been main-tained that it was necessary to continue the contracts for theseguns in order to employ labour. He sympathised with this pointof view at that time, but he must now press for a reconsideration of the artillery position with a view to effecting all possibleeconomy. He would point out that the present time, at the con-clusion of an exhausting war, was about the worst that could be selected for incurring an expenditure amounting to several millionpounds for an object which was in reality the re-equipment of the artillery with 18-pr. guns.The Secretary of State for War said that if all the war con-tracts had been suddenly cancelled on the 11th November it wouldhave meant the throwing out of work of a vast number of people,which would have created an anxious situation, and it had notbeen considered a wise course to pursue. The Ministry ofMunitions had got round the difficulty of continuing to employlarge numbers of people on munitions by taking delivery of articles which it was cheaper to finish than to abandon. They thus con-tinued a reduced production till Christmas and on into the newyear. When the Armistice was signed the War Office was halfway through rearming our artillery, which, when completed,would have the effect of making it the finest artillery in the world.The continuance of the manufacture of guns was one of the mainmethods of providing employment, and if that had not been done it would hsffie meant the manufacture of other articles not souseful. He would like to draw the Cabinet&apos;s attention to thefollowing calculation: -18-pr. Guns.  Estimated cost of 2,500 equipments ...   4,500,000Already expended (3rd June)  labour  andmaterial ... ... ...   2,925,000Saving if stopped ... ...   1,575,000Plus scrap       ... ... ...      160,0001,735,000From this saving compensation would requireto be paid, say       ... ... ...     735,000Net saving, say ... ... 1,000,000As a result of saving this l,O0O,000Z., it would mean that only500 guns would be produced as against 2,500.The Chancellor of the Exchequer asked the size of army itwas calculated these 2,500 guns would arm.The Master-General of Ordnance replied that in reality the/- order for the 2,500 had nothing to do with the size of the army.\ After the 11th November, 191 f, he drafted a letter to the Ministryof Munitions informing them that the War Office wished to cancelall outstanding orders for guns and ammunition, but that, as theywere aware that it would be impossible for the Ministry ofMunitions to shut down all manufacture and demobilise all their labour immediately, there were certain articles that they would prefer to receive to others. Of these the new 18-prs. were most acceptable. The War Office left it to the Ministry of munitions to say how many of these equipments would be delivered. this number was 2,500. The 2,500 guns would equip 30 divisions and provide for wastage for six months of war.Sir James Stevenson said that the number of guns originally contemplated was about 4,500, and the cutting down of this figure to 2,500 only was done in order to compensate employers who wereproducing other munitions, the production of which was abruptly
 7,396,000What he could not understand was the figure of 1,380,000Z. for theRoyal Ordnance Factories, as contracts entered into before theArmistice could not affect these factories.Sir James Stevenson said that the furniture for the 18-pr.guns was made in different parts of the country, and it had beendecided to send these various parts to W^oolwich in order that theyshould be made into gun carriages. This accounted for theexpenditure under the Royal Ordnance Factories.Mr. Bonar Law said that, as he saw the situation, theMinistry of Munitions had to make more guns in order -to employlabour, and they also continued the contracts they had enteredinto for the guns as a means of cutting down the compensation which had to be paid for other articles. Further, they tried toobtain goods which would be useful in future. He thought, how-ever, that no fresh money should be spent on the arming of theForces in the future, but that we should live on the armamentwhich had been left over from the war.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Situation at Fiume. 4. The War Cabinet had before them a telegram from theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (No. 1132) stating that &apos;M. Clernenceau was deeply moved by further reports of conflictat Fiume between the French and Italians, and had determined to send a French man-of-war to that port. Mr. Balfour addedin his telegram that he was disposed to think that the Britishshould also send a warship to Fiume.Lord Curzon then read out to the Cabinet a telegram he hadreceived from Sir Rennell Rodd (No. 469, the 8th July), detailingthe events at Fiume which had occasioned rioting and murder.Sir R. Rodd suggested that the British Military Mission at Fiumeshould be instructed to send full telegraphic reports to the Mili-tary Attache at Rome, who at present received no such reports,and was unable to visit the front himself owing to War. Officeinstructions.Mr. Bonar Law drew attention to a further telegram whichhad been received from&apos; Mr. Balfour (No. 1130) stating that theCouncil of Foreign Ministers had decided to appoint an Inter-Allied Commission, consisting of the military officer each of theUnited States, British Empire, France, and Italy, to enquire intorecent incidents at Fiume, and to recommend means of improving the situation in the future, and to nominate representatives toreceive collective instructions from the Council.The First Sea Lord said that the War Cabinet decided some-time ago that in the event of any disturbance at Fiume the british naval forces should withdraw and take no part.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the Britishalready had a man-of-war at Fiume, which was now under a Rear-Admiral. In fact, there was another British Admiral at Fiume,who was in charge of the British Mission there. He suggestedthat he should wire to the Rear-Admiral on board His M?jesty&apos;sstopped, and thus reduce the amount we should have had to pay for broken contracts.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in the Ministry ofMunitions estimate for 1919-1920 appeared the following figures as commitments on war contracts:   Trade ... ... ... ...     5,500,000Royal Ordnance Factories ... ...     1,380,000 national Ordnance Factories     ...     &apos;    ...       516,000
ship at Fiume saying that, if anything exceptional happened, hewas to use his own judgment.Mr. Bonar Law questioned the necessity of wiring any instructions. It might, he thought, be assumed that the Bear-Admiral would take full responsibility for any action he deemeddesirable.The War Cabinet decided That the Secretary of State for War should take the measures recommended by Sir Eennell Rodd.2.
