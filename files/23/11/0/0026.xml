Policy in Russia.&apos;&quot; 2. With reference to War Cabinet 505, Minute 3, the WarCabinet had under consideration the following papers : A Memorandum by Lord Curzon, covering a draft despatch(Paper G.T.-*947).A Memorandum from the Admiralty regarding  the  naval situation in respect of Russia (Paper G.T.-7911).A letter from the Admiralty to the Foreign Office (paper g.T-7954).A letter  from Mr. Balfour to the Prime  Minister  (paper g.T.-7949) regarding the occupation of the Caucasus.The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that hisdraft despatch presented an attempt to clear up the situation inRussia, showing hoAV it had arisen, and our several obligations. Atpresent there existed no definite policy on our part, and noco-ordinated policy on the part of the Allies, in regard to Lithuania,Latvia; Esthonia, the Caucasus, and other parts of the former russian Empire. So far as Great Britain was concerned, thiswas the more serious as we were the most willing to assist, and, withthe exception of the United States, were the richest of the Allies.Accordingly we had to bear the financial brunt of holding up thevarious fragments of Russia. He had suggested at the previous meeting that we should try and piece together the factors thatAeroplanes for ]. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that there was anRoumama. *   -urgent question upon which he wished a decision of the WarCabinet. The Royal Air Force had been negotiating for some timein regard to a request of the Roumanian military authorities that weshould send them aeroplanes, to be purchased on long credit. he himself had been opposed to this, and had recommended that the transaction should be on a cash basis. The Air Council had pointedout that the aeroplanes were rapidly deteriorating in value, andwould shortly be worth nothing, and had suggested that, in thecircumstances, it would-be better to send them to Roumania on longcredit.The Prime Minister thought that the supply of these aeroplanesshould not be authorised until it was quite clear that M. Bratianointended to act in concert with the Allies. At present Roumaniawas defying them.The Secretary of State for War said he regarded this as a smallmatter. In any case, the aeroplanes could not reach Roumania forseveral months. He proposed that he should tbe authorised to con-tinue the negotiations, but that the aeroplanes should not be actuallydelivered until Roumania had once more &quot; come into the fold.&quot;The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was strongly of opinion that we should conduct no negotiations with Roumaniauntil she had promised to act wholly in accord with the policy ofthe Allies. She had lately been engaged on what was a purelyfilibustering expedition in Hungary.The Prime Minister thought that there was very little chanceof Roumania ever paying for the aeroplanes, and said that he agreed with the Secretary of State for War and the Acting Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs, that negotiations should be broken off untilRoumania gave proof of future good behaviour.The War Cabinet decided that Negotiations in regard to the sale of aeroplanes to Roumaniashould be broken off, subject to proof being forthcomingof Roumania&apos;s intention to accept the advice of the Alliesand to act in accord with them ;and directed The Secretary of State for Air to take action accordingly.
constituted the situation ; that we should endeavour to transfer thedirection of affairs in Russia from Paris to London, and that weshould concentrate in London an Inter-Allied Council, and then create a pool to which the several Powers would each contribute what theycould. It would then be for the Powers to agree to assign,to them-selves spheres in,which they were respectively politically interested,or which were suitable on account of geographical propinquity. Therewas no doubt that great work had been done by us under GeneralKnox in Siberia, but it was impossible for us to continue our supportboth in Siberia and South Russia. He sincerely trusted that theCouncil suggested by him. would persuade Japan and the Unitedthey would accept the responsibility. It was more than probable thatthey would be deterred by Kolchak&apos;s recent lack of success. Asregards the Baltic States, we had no policy. All we had done wasto recognise the de facto authority of the Esthonian Government.He desired, in this connection, to pay a tribute to the splendid work done by the Navy, and to the support given by the Admiralty, who,however, were persistent in asking for a definition of our policy inthe Baltic.The Prime Minister and Mr. Bonar Law were both of opinionthat the Powers would refuse the suggestion of a pool, and thePrime Minister added that M. Clemenceau (though not the Quaid&apos;Orsay) had practically written Russia off his books.The Secretary of State for AVar said that the one bright spot inRussia was the present position of General Denikin, who was nowhalf-way to Saratoff. General Holman, who was now the head ofour Military Mission with Denikin, had been up to see the recent fighting, and had been much impressed by the powers of quickmovement and fighting qualities of Denikin&apos;s volunteer troops.Denikin seemed to be welcomed everywhere, and many volunteerswere coming forward to join him, while others asked to beconscripted in order to save their face in case the tide in that parteventually turned in favour of the Bolsheviks. One of Denikin&apos;staff, General Dragomiroff, who was at present in England, saidthat Denikin&apos;s intention was to continue his advance towardsMoscow. Only the other day he had captured 10,000 prisoners,and he had now coal, oil, and other resources at his disposal whichwould enable him to carry on operations in the winter. The plan of Lenin and Trotsky undoubtedly was to smash Kolchak first,and then to turn south and crush Denikin. He (Mr. Churchill)thought it a pity that Kolchak had decided&apos; to make a stand atCheliabinsk, as he had lost a large number of his training officersand an immense amount of stores. A far better policy would havebeen to retire slowly and draw the Bolsheviks after him.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff, in reply to a question,said that he did not know how many men it would be possible forDenikin to enlist or what their fighting qualities would be. Hethought that the transport facilities of the Bolsheviks must be veryindifferent, more especially as they no longer controlled the coal supplies.The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he did not quite share Mr. Churchilbs view about General Denikin.If we really thought that Denikin could reach Moscow, we mightentertain hopes of his crushing Bolshevism. In his view, however,our most serious difficulty was that Denikin&apos;s ambitions, as he understood, lay not in the direction of Moscow, but towards theCaucasus. General Bridges, was&apos; recently back from, the lattertheatre and had confirmed this view. If we withdrew from theCaucasus we should have to give up our fleet in the Caspian, andprobably it had already been handed over to Denikin. The lattercould only get oil for the fleet at Baku ; he would therefore certainlymove against Baku, and would, in consequence, be involved in aserious war with the Azerbaijan State. General Bridges had said that  he  was  certain that, directly we left the Caucasus,States to take over our
Denikin would turn Ms back on Moscow and overrun Georgia andAzerbaijan, whick seemed to present an easy prey. We bad acertain safeguard there, as we only supplied munitions to Denikinon condition that he undertook to respect a fixed line which wehad drawn north of the Caucasus, beyond which he promised thathe would not go. Lord Curzon said that he had a word of warning to utter: he doubted whether Denikin would achieve any great success, and it was possible that he might fail like Kolchak ; more-over, he did not suspect him of ambitions in the Caucasus direction.In reply to a question by Lord Milner, Lord Curzon stated that wehad a political representative with Denikin in the person of ColonelKeyes.The Prime Minister thought it was a pity that our political representative was an official with military rank. We knew fromexperience that foreign Generals were not disposed to take orders from subordinate British military officers, and it would have been preferable, in his view, that our Representative should have beena civilian, say, a Member of Parliament with Middle Easternexperience.The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought that Lord Curzon&apos;sapprehensions in regard to Denikin applied to all the Russians wehad helped.- He doubted whether any of them would ever listen to our advice or give us the guarantees we wanted, and accept ourdirection of their policy.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff, in reply to a question by the Prime Minister, thought that if Denikin was well supportedwith equipment and arms, and if he could keep the population hewas at present absorbing in a good temper, there was no reason why he should not take Moscow, as the experience of the War hadtaught us that it was possible to fight in Russia in the winter. Ifhe had a few more successes, Denikin might be able to link up with roumania.The Secretary of State for War pointed out that the GeneralStaff had never been of opinion, nor had he expressed that view tothe War Cabinet, that General Denikin would succeed. The issue was, Could Kolchak continue to contain the Bolshevist armiesopposing him until Denikin became strong enough to meet thefull blow of the Bolshevist armies ? He did not agree&apos;with lord curzon that Denikin would- abandon his idea of getting to moscow and turn towards the Caucasus. When we left the Caucasus therewould be a general convulsion, anarchy, massacres, and so on, andit was not possible for us to arrest or avert this. Instead ofinvading the Caucasus, he thought Denikin might have to detachcertain troops to guard his rear, and he would certainly have tosecure his supply of oil from Baku. Dragomiroff had told him that Denikin himself was afraid that, when we left the Caucasus,the nations there would attack him. These nations, when we firstwent there, gave us anything but a welcome ; now, however, theywere imploring us to stay. But this would be dangerous unless we decided to maintain a considerable force there; there was nomiddle course between clearing out and an effective occupation.The, Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointedout that Denikin was already putting in a claim for Batum,.where he had no conceivable business. If, as haeC been suggestedby the Secretary of State for War, Denikin was too weak to invade the Caucasus, he must surely be too weak to attempt toreach Moscow.The Prime Minister asked what were, not the chances, butthe probabilities of Denikin&apos;s success.The Chief &apos; of the Imperial General Staff said that Denikin,.like the Bolsheviks, had a big population upon which to draw forrecruits, but Denikin had the coalfields, which the Bolsheviks hadnot. Moreover, Denikin would be in possession of better equip-ment so long as it was provided  by the  Allies.   As  regards;
Denikin&apos;s prospects of getting to Moscow, he thought that theywere slight, unless we provided him with the extra 250,000 sets of equipment for which he had asked. So far we had refused Denikinnothing, except, of course, troops..The Prime Minister thought that, gun for gun, both Kolchakand Denikin should be far superior to the Bolsheviks, as the latter had surrendered all their guns to the Germans.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the problems facingDenikin were : (a) the control of Baku in order to supply himself with oil; (6) to control the Ukraine in order to secure its foodstuffs.His supporters must be fed if they were to be contented, and mustbe contented if they were to fight. He himself did not think it waspossible to supply all the population in the area now controlled byDenikin with food and clothes, &amp;c. The War Office had asked for ,00O,0O0L for this purpose, which was a mere drop in the ocean.The view held . by the Supreme Economic Council was that50,000,000L was the minimum which could be of any use in theBaltic States and a less sum would not suffice for South Russia.The Secretary of State for the Colonies pointed out that thefood difficulty must be much greater so far as the Bolsheviks were concerned.The President of the Board of Education asked what were the motives actuating Denikin&apos;s army. Were the Cossacks therefighting to free their territory which would be a very naturalmotive as they were notoriously devoted to their homes or werethey really keen on carrying out Denikin&apos;s more ambitious projects ?The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thought thatthe War Cabinet was discussing three rather different facets of theproblem : (1.) His own draft despatch in regard to our policy, whichpresented   the  first  effort   we  had   made to secureco-ordination and a fair distribution of the burden.(2.) What measures of support should be given to Denikin (a.) In respect of military supplies.(6.) An economic grant.(3.) The evacuation of the Caucasus.Were we to clear out entirely, or did we propose to leavePolitical Representatives there with a small guard? He hoped thatthe War Cabinet would agree to the terms of his despatch, as hethought they did offer some chance of a definite co-ordinated policy.The Prime Minister did not think that the three questions couldbe discussed separately. He himself favoured the idea of aconference, but thought that our representative, whoever he mightbe, must be in possession of a clear-cut definite policy which hecould put before our Allies. There were at present ominous gapsin the despatch (he referred, he said, to the omitted figures), andthese were formidable arches in the bridge, as the question of costwas most important in defining our policy. He had been reading agood deal of Bolshevist literature lately, and from it he gathered theimpression that they had no intention, at present, of organisingforces to invade the Baltic provinces. The Esthonians were constantly complaining of antagonistic forces, some of which were certainly anti-Bolshevist.The Secretary of State for War, in reply to a question, said thatthe Bolshevist army amounted roughly to 5u0,000 men, who were disposed as follows : 100,000 in the west;30,000 in the north ;125,000 opposite Denikin;and a similar  amount  opposite Kolchak.    These figures wereapproximate only.[592] C
The Chief of the Imperial General Staff, replying to a question,by the Prime Minister as to whether the Bolshevists would be ableto overwhelm Denikin before he was able, to consolidate his position,said that it was a question of transport, supplies, and equipment.There were plenty of railways in that area, but rolling-stock wasdeficient. We had already supplied a quarter of a million, sets of.equipment to Denikin, who had asked for another half million sets.Half of these were now on their way.The Secretary of State for War said that all he had suggestedwas that we should continue to send to Denikin our surplus non-marketable ammunitions; that we should maintain our handful ofBritish officers and non-commissioned officers ; that we should send a certain amount of marketable stuff, which Denikin. had asked for ;that the War Office should fix the sum to be spent on the latter ; andthat we should settle now an interim policy to be pursued for thenext six months, at the end of which the whole situation should be reviewed. We should also reserve to ourselves complete freedom to reverse our policy if we choose.The First Lord of the Admiraltj7 expressed the hope that the WarCabinet would approve Lord Curzon&apos;s draft despatch in principle.The Admiralty had no. idea what the British policy or that of theEntente Powers was in regard to the various fragments of Russia, andthey would be profoundly relieved if they could be told definitely ofsome settled policy. The total Admiralty cost, up to the present, was18 millions, which did not include the mercantile marine expenses or make allowance for the loss of two cruisers and two sloops bymines. We were at present keeping a large number of men in theBaltic who ought to be released, and he reminded the Cabinet thatit was not as easy to demobilise a ship as it was a battalion.The Prime Minister thought that the total cost of our support to the anti-Bolshevist elements in. Russia was not less than100 millions a year,The Minister of Health enquired whether, supposing we sentLord Curzon&apos;s despatch, we were committed to taking under ourwing any one of the various nationalities referred to ?The Prime Minister quoted from the third paragraph on page 8,&quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government assumed that there is general agree-ment that assistance must be continued to those groups both inside and upon the borders of Russia Avho are struggling to maintain their hard-won.liberties, and, although there can be no question ofthe further despatch of troops to the Western and Southern theatres,arms, munitions, and material of all kinds must continue to be sentto the various groups who are being supported by the AlliedGovernments.&quot;Sir Eric Geddes said that we had no idea as to what our commitments might amount eventually.   We were now asked togive 2 millions sterling to Denikinv for the support of a population,.,estimates of which varied enormously.The Prime Minister, in reply to a question by Mr. Fisher as towhat policy it was proposed to pursue, quoted the following fromthe bottom of page 2 of the draft despatch : &quot; The hostilities which are still in progress between the forcesof the Allied Governments and those of the Soviet Government .....are partly inspired by obligations and responsibilities toward thoseRussians who have trusted the Allies and thrown in their lot withthem. They are also partly in the nature of defensive measures designed to preserve the fruits of victory by preventing, or at, leastrestricting, the spread of a political conflagration which is capable,if unarrested, of nullifying its result not only over Russia alone, butover vast contiguous areas of the European continent.&quot;That : is practically a war against Bolshevism. The draft despatch really raised all the questions at issue ; it raised something which might be interpreted not as merely the fulfilment of our
existing obligations, but an organised campaign against Bolshevism ;and this he regarded as dangerous. -The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointed outthat - this was not the interpretation he had intended should beplaced upon this&apos;part of his despatch. What he had desired toindicate was, that our object was to prevent Germany using the newsmall States as a springboard from which she could plunge iutoRussia and eventually get control of the country. If she evercontrived to do this the effects of the late war would be lost; as hehad stated in his- despatch, &quot; compensation for the loss of the oldGerman colonies may be found in the creation of a new and vastlygreater colony, namely, Russia herself.&quot;The Prime Minister, continuing, quoted the following frompage 3 of the despatch : &quot; The motives, therefore, of the presentand continued intervention of the Powers in Russia are twofold a sense of obligation to those whom they have encouraged and whoare still in the main dependent on their support,&quot; that, he thought,the Cabinet fully accepted &quot; and the duty of self-preservation,namely, the avoidance in Europe of a situation which at no distantdate may lead to a renewal of the conflict from which we have only just emerged.&quot; This latter sentence, he thought, bore out lord curzon&apos;s interpretation.The Chancellor of the Exchequer wondered whether non-Bolshevist Russia would be less likely to fall a prey to Germany thanBolshevist Russia.The President of the Board of Education said the same question had occurred to him. In any case Germany would have in Russia a great field for commercial enterprise, and it wasimpossible for us to stop her. Germany had permeated Russiabefore the war ; she was still on her frontier, and she would inevitably penetrate into Russia again. If we wished to cultivatefriendly relations with whatever Russian Government might existlater, we had to bear in mind the fact that a strong current hadbeen running in Russia for ages in the direction of a united nation.If the Russians thought that the Entente meant to set up separateprovincial governments at Reval, Moscow, or elsewhere, they, would throw themselves into the arms of Germany. It was important that we should not irrevocably commit ourselves to any policywhich would have this effect. We must fulfil our obligations, butwe must set a limit, and it was essential that we should notprejudge the case. We ought also to consider at an early dated general rearrangement of our position as regards Russia. Fiehimself thought that Denikin had shot his bolt. The supremeinterest of the world to-day was peace. Civil warfare in russia was sterilising the economic effort of millions. No matter whatGovernment might be set up in Russia, what was really importantwas that trade should be set going and production started afresh.The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that hehad tried to bring this out in his despatch, and quoted the followingfrom page 10 : &quot; It deals, however, only with the situation in Russia as itexists to-day, and it may well be that before many months have elapsed that situation wall have undergone a radical change, and that the Powers may then be faced with the. necessity of having once more to reconsider their position.&quot;The Baltic States were too small and too near Russia andGermany to maintain themselves, and it was desirable therefore that they should have some sort of&apos; protection from the entente powers. It had been necessary for us to settle our policy from clay-to day, and the line upon which we&apos; had proceeded was that these states should not be crushed or absorbed. If they were everre-absorbed in Russia, they should go in on a federal basis. his despatch had, in fact, envisaged a federation of Baltic States.
Turning to the Caucasus, Lord Curzon stated that these werenot Russian States, nor had they Russian population. It had takenRussia a hundred years to conquer them, and although Denikinlooked upon them as belonging to Russia, as a matter of fact theyhad only been subdued as part of Russia&apos;s eastern ambitions. Hereminded the War Cabinet that the little States, particularly in theBaltic, had played a fine and courageous part in the war ; if andwhen they were reconquered, we were bound to try and get the bestterms for them.Mr. Barnes felt that Great Britain had fully discharged her obligations to these peoples. In his opinion, we were alwaysbacking the wrong horse. The real governing force in Russia wasthe Soviet Government, and he asked how long wTe-were to continueto bolster up the various little States and temporary Governmentssuch as Denikin&apos;s and Kolehak&apos;s. If we were to go on doing this,we must get a guarantee from the United States that the americans would stand in with us.The Minister of Health said that the draft despatch advocated (a.) Our continuing to resist Bolshevism.(6.) Our continuing to support Denikin.He agreed with Mr. Barnes that the Bolshevists were the onlyreally governing force. He did not quite understand what lord curzon proposed in the way of a barrier between Russia andGermany. In any case we could not prevent, as Mr. Fisher had.pointed out, the economic penetration of Russia by Germany. he believed that there was room enough in Russia for both Germanyand ourselves. He thought that the warring elements to-day inRussia should be left to settle their own squabbles themselves, andthat we should Only give such support to our loyal friends in theCaucasus as would enable us to fulfil our obligations of honour. Inreply to a question by Mr. Churchill he said that he was not infavour of assisting the Esthonians, but thought that they should be encouraged to open negotiations with the Bolshevists. It was out ofthe question that Esthonia could exist as a separate State unaided.The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said thatthe Entente Powers had deliberately set up Poland and the. baltic states as a barrier between Russia and Germany. If we allowed the Baltic States to go, unquestionably Poland would go also.The Secretary of State for War said that he would take ourvarious commitments in Russia seriatim, and would suggest a policy : (1.) Our greatest source of expense was North Russia : thiswould end in a month or so when we would have withdrawn.(2.) The Baltic States ; here again our expense would end ina few weeks.(3.) The Caucasus ; from which our withdrawal would begin in a few days.(4.) Kolchak ; we had suspended the srrpplies that we had been giving to him.(5.) Our fleet in the Black Sea ; there was no need to apprehenddanger there.(6.) Denikin ; we had diverted to him supplies which had been going to North Russia and Siberia.He proposed that we should give him our non-marketable surplusof munitions, and also 4,000,000L or 5,0U0,000Z. worth of marketablestores, and we should tell him that we were not prepared to do anymore for him. If his movement succeeded, well and good. If, onthe other hand, an equipoise was maintained between the conflictingforces, he thought we should try and get Lenin&apos;s Government andthe anti-Bolshevists to come to terms.
Mr. Bonar Law said with regard to the Baltic States that weshould clearly state to the Allied Bowers that if we were to continueto assist them we must do it in proper fashion ; that we were notable to shoulder the whole burden, and that they must come in and take their share. As regards Denikin, he agreed with Mr. Churchillthat we should help him until the end of this year and tell him thatafter that period our support must be withdrawn. We ought to seta limit, both in respect of the amount and the period of theassistance which we gave him.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that what was nowproposed amounted to this : if the Allies were not prepared to take their share of the burden we must let the Baltic States take theirchance of being overrun by Germany.The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought that we had neveraccepted any definite obligations in regard to those States.The Prime Minister confirmed this, and said that we had neverdefinitely recognised them any more than we had recognisedTchaikovsky or Kolchak or any other provisional Government, Wehad left their recognition to be decided by the League of Nations.The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that wehad recognised Poland and Finland and also the de factoGovernment in Esthonia. So far as the other States were concerned,we had merely given them encouragement.The Chancellor of the Exchequer asked whether we should notadvise the smaller States to open up negotiations with the bolshevists. Fie thought the policy of continuing to bolster them up was unsound, and he doubted the validity of our obligations tomen who persisted in disregarding our advice.The Secretary of State for War pointed out that, whatever our policy might be, we had no power to enforce it. If we had, say,thirty divisions which we could put into the field to-morrow, theattitude of the various elements in Russia might be very different.As regards the suggestion that we should withdraw all support from Kolchak and Denikin, he reminded the Cabinet that thesemen and their followers had been engaged many months in fighting the most horrible tyranny and brutality the world had ever seen.The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought that history wasrepeating itself, and thnt Russia, like France after the Revolution,was being re-born.The First Lord of the Admiralty declared that he viewed withthe greatest apprehension any attempt to get the non-Bolshevists inRussia to make peace with the Soviet Government.The Prime Minister said that facts had to be faced. First, wewere practically alone. France had boastfully stated in parliament and in the press that the Allies must fight Bolshevism. She, how-ever, intended herself to do nothing, and was now withdrawing from Russia. M. Clemenceau had said that France would not have any further intervention, and that he himself was taking grave riskswhen he sent troops to Archangel. Further, France wras bankrupt,and not beginning to pay her way.It was possible that the Americans might concern themselves with affairs in Eastern Siberia, as they were afraid of the Japanesegetting too strong a footing there ; Western Siberia, however, wouldprobably fall into the hands of the Bolsheviks. As he had said, wewere shouldering the burden alone, and we were spending100,O0O,000Z. a year on operations in Russia, which was half our expenditure before the war. Secondly, Kolchak&apos;s failure had funda-mentally altered the whole face of the war. In May, things werelooking black, and it was all-important that peace should be signedas soon as possible. At that time, Kolchak&apos;s chances seemed to beimproving, and in deciding to support him we took what seemed tobe quite a legitimate risk. He felt himself that there was hardly an even chance of Denikin&apos;s reaching Moscow. AVe must thereforelook at probabilities, and frame our policy accordingly.   He strongly[592] . D
favoured the main theme of Lord Curzon&apos;s very clear and valuabledespatch. . We ought to summon our Allies to London, or, ifM. Clemenceau could not come here, to suggest a conference inParisbut before our representatives went there they must have some settled policy as a basis of discussion. He inclined to thepolicy suggested by Mr. Churchill. We must clear out of north russia. We could no longer continue to support Kolchak unlessthe United States and Japan were prepared to take this on. Asregards the Baltic Provinces, if we intervened we would be up against both Bolsheviks and anti-Bolsheviks. These Provinces were mainly interested in. the economic side, and not in the idea of a united Russia. Moreover, neither Denikin nor Kolchak appearedto be anxious for our continued support to the Baltic States.Nothing could prevent the German penetration of Russia. Further,she must pay her indemnity somehow, and Russia was the only possible big market open to her, and it was at her door. Thatmarket, in any case, would demand more goods than we couldsupply. We certainly could not go to war again in order to place a customs barrier between Germany and Russia.The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointed outthat his argument was, not that we should set up a Customs barrier,but that we should take steps to prevent Germany establishing abig military power in Eastern Europe.The Prime Minister, proceeding, asked what was likely to happen if a great civil war continued in Russia ? Lenin had largelyequipped his army from what he had captured from Kolchak, andhe might himself develop great military power in Russia by drawingupon the 200,000 or so non-commissioned officers of the old german army, as well as great numbers of officers who had now noprofession and would inevitably gravitate towards Russia if civil war continued. If, however, peace were established, the Bolshevikswould not wish to maintain an army, as their creed was fundament-ally anti-militarist. He himself would give Denikin one last&quot; packet,&quot; so to speak, and he suggested that the Secretaryof State for Wax should state what the contents of the &quot; packet &quot;should be, and estimate its cost. We Rhould say to Denikin : &quot; you must make the most of it. You have all the coal of Russia, you will get plentiful supplies of oil, and you will soon be in possession ofthe main food supplies. We have carried you up to. a point where you are self-supporting ; we cannot give you gratis any moresupplies, though we are prepared to trade with you on the usuallines.&quot; Then,When he was firmly established, we should aim atmaking peace in Russia. In the firm (but not too firm) consilidation of Denikin&apos;s position, he saw the best chance of a satisfactory peace.If both sides were fairly strong, Lenin would say, &quot; Denikiu ispowerful enough to prevent me getting any coal; &quot; and Denikin,on his part, would say, &quot; Lenin is too powerful to give me any prospect of reaching Moscow.&quot; The Prime Minister1 said that he put this up as an objective, and he left it to the. War Cabinet tosay whether the objective should be stated in the re-drafted despatch,or whether it should be given as part of the instructions to ourplenipotentiary attending ,the Conference. He himself inclined tothe latter alternative: He thought that Lord Curzon should be) asked to amend his despatch, stating all the facts, informing our allies that we could not continue&apos; to bear the burden alone, that inour opinion the time had come for a discussion and that weinvited them to meet us in Conference. The Secretary of State forWar.should also be asked to prepare his &quot;packet &quot; and his estimateof its cost, and it could then be sent to Denikin as a final gift tohim. Finland was another matter. He had no feeling about herat all, as she had been quite prepared to welcome the Germans.The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said thatthere was one rather important question in connection with theBaltic States, and that was that we had a good many representatives
2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,August 12, 1919.scattered about there. In view of the discussion in Parliament onFriday next, he thought that our promised financial statement, as atpresent drafted, was artificial, inasmuch as the Admiralty, who were strongly opposed to our policy in Russia, had yet been committed tosuch a considerable expenditure. This, he thought, should be putright.The Secretary of State for War pointed out that, when we-withdrew from North Russia, we should have less than 2,000 british officers and men with Denikin, and that there would be more French,American, and Japanese soldiers in Russia than British troops. Hethought this should, be borne in mind in preparing any statementcomplaining that we were bearing the whole burden.The Prime Minister said that, as regards the Caucasus, the americans were apparently prepared to take charge of Constant!-nople and Armenia, but absolutely refused to send any troops.The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed theWar Cabinet that, on the previous day, he had discussed thequestion of the Caucasus with the United States Ambassador, whohad said that, although it was. true that. President Wilson was prepared to accept a mandate for Armenia and perhaps Con-stantinople, in all probability Congress would insist on a strictadherence to the old traditional policy of the Washington Govern -ment, and not endorse either commitment. Moreover, Mr. Davieshad further told him that the question would probably not besettled for another three months. In view of this, he suggestedthat we must follow the&apos; line proposed by Field-Marshal Wilson,and continue our evacuation of the Caucasus, leaving there one ortwo representatives, with small personal guards.The Secretary of State for War said he attached importanceto the Prime Ministers view that we should have some political representative in the Caucasus and South Russia, who should beresponsible to the Government for keeping us in touch with allthat went on in the Caucasus and in the area over which Denikinwas operating.The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointed outthat there were physical difficulties in the way of one man beingresponsible for both areas.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should,in his reply on behalf of the Prime Minister toMr. BalfouFs letter of the 9th August, 1919 (paper g.T.-7949), inform him of what the American Ambas-ambassador had said on the previous day, and should statethat His &apos; Majesty&apos;s Government propose to adhere totheir policy of evacuating the Caucasus, leaving only afew representatives with guards.(&amp;.) The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should prepare an amended draft of his despatch in the sense of the above discussion.(c.) The Secretary of State for War should prepare a statement showing the amount and nature of the stores he proposed should be sent to General Denikin as a final.contribution from His Majesty&apos;s Government, the statement to include an estimate of the cost of the stores and their trans-portation.
