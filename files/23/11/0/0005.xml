With reference to War Cabinet 577, Minute 1, the WarCabinet had before them a memorandum by the Home Secretary(Paper G.T.-7634) covering the Report of the Committee on thePolice Service of England, Wales, and Scotland.The Home Secretary said that he desired the authority of theWar Cabinet to include in the Police Bill the proposals as tostandardisation of pay and conditions of service and as to thenew pensions scale, and to promise the grant from Imperial fundsrecommended by the Committee. Their recommendation regardingthis grant was as follows: &quot; The direct supplementary grant from Imperial fundswhich was instituted last year to be increased from, and including, the financial year 1918-19, so as to cover at least one-half of the cost of the Police, including the cost ofpensions without any additional charge being thrown on theO Exchequer Contribution Account by reason of the increase inthe cost of pay and clothing, and this direct grant to be calcu-lated in each year on the expenditure of that year instead of on the expenditure of the previous year.&quot;[171] B
He would also ask the Cabinet to adopt the Committee&apos;s recom-mendations regarding scales of pay. These did not require legis-lative sanction, except authority for the provision of the necessary funds.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Treasury hadnot had sufficient time to examine the proposals as regards pay,but, in view of the previous discussion at the Cabinet and thepublic announcements already made, he imagined that there wasno alternative for the Government but to accept. With regardto the Committee&apos;s recommendation as to the direct supplementarygrant, he would suggest that Sir Edward Troup should meet theTreasury representatives that afternoon and go into this question.He believed there was nothing in the Governments previousstatement regarding Police Pay which prejudged the question ofthe allocation of costs as between the Exchequer and the LocalAuthorities. The Treasury were reluctant to prejudge the ques-tion of Exchequer Grants in a particular case, as the whole system was under review.Mr. Bonar Law said that, with regard to the draft PoliceBill, he disliked bills coming up before the Cabinet which had only been examined by the responsible department, and he would suggest that the Police Bill be taken by the Home Affairs Com-mittee on the following day. He could understand that the HomeSecretary did not want any delay in introducing this Bill, but ifit was passed by the ITome Affairs Committee it might be printedduring the week-end and introduced in the House simultaneously with the publication of Lord Desborough&apos;s Report.   .The Home Secretary said that, as far as the Bill was con-cerned, he only required authority to introduce the clause givingpower to the Home Secretary to standardise the rates of pay ofthe Police all over the country. Power was already possessed toregulate the pay, &amp;c, of County Police Forces, and the effect of clause 4 was merely to extend this to Boroughs and to add the requirement that representatives of Police and Police Authoritiesshould be consulted. He would like to add that the representa-tives of all the largest Boroughs in England had asked that theHome Office should take such powers. The Government waspledged that the advance in pay should benefit all the Police inGreat Britain, but was not pledged to pay half the extra cost,although this was what he now proposed should be borne by theExchequer. In addition, the power of the Home Office tostandardise the pay was essential to the working of the PoliceFederation it was proposed to set up.Mr. Barnes said that in paragraph 82 of Lord Desborough&apos;sReport it was recommended that a Central Committee, consistingof representatives of the Metropolitan Police, County Police, andBorough Police, be set up, and that this body should meet once ayear with the Chief Constables, Superintendents, and police authorities, on the basis of a round table conference, preside over by a representative of the Home Office, to consider questions affecting the Police service of England and Wales as a whole. he doubted the advisability of a Home Office official presiding over this conference, and thought that an outsider would be moredesirable.The Home Secretary said that they were not following thisrecommendation in the Police Bill. With regard to the body whichwould represent the views of the rank and file of the Police Force,it was proposed that the first nominations should be made by theChief Constables, after which the men would run the organisationthemselves and appoint their own officials. The only body over which a Home Office official would preside would be a jointmeeting between the men&apos;s representatives and the representatives;of the Authorities. &apos;The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Police bill would require a money resolution, and it was the custom to take
Sinking of german ships at ScapaFlow.The Case of the OldNaval Pensioners.2. With reference to War Cabinet 584, Minute 2, the FirstLord of the Admiralty said that the Admiralty had received thereport of the Commander-in-Chief, Grand Fleet, regarding theScapa Flow incident, and he asked the leave of the Cabinet to publish it.The War Cabinet decided that The First Lord of the Admiralty should circulate to the&apos;   \      Cabinet the Commander-in-Chief&apos;s report, and that, ifu no objection was raised by any member of the cabinet after a two days&apos; interval after the circulation, the FirstLord should take steps regarding its publication.3. With reference to War Cabinet 582, Minute 3, the WarCabinet had before them a memorandum by the Admiralty regard-ing the case of the old Naval pensioners (Paper G.T.-7473).The First Lord of the Admiralty said that it would be remem-bered that the Committee presided over by Admiral Jerram was strongly in favour of extending the improved rates of Navalpensions to all pensioners on the roll. The Board of Admiralty,while agreeing with the opinion of the Committee, recognisedthat the question of applying the improved scales to pensionersother than those who had served during the War, and futurepensioners, raised issues which could not be confined to the Navyalone.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, if this were done for the Navy, similar concessions would have to be made to theArmy and the Civil Service, which would involve a total expendi-ture of nearly 4,000,0007. He had been met with a similar demand from the old Civil Service pensioners, and had informed them thattheir bargain with the State had been concluded, and that he didnot see his way to relieve them at the expense of&apos;the taxpayer.money resolutions in the large. This course was satisfactory whenthe Bills were taken in Committee, where it was usual for increased expenditure to be granted only on the motion of a Minister and where the Government could command a majority. Such a course,however, was fatal when bills were taken by a Grand Committee,where the Government could not command a majority. At presentthese Committees were increasing the cost of bills against theGovernment. He would therefore be glad if the Home secretary would draw the money resolution for the Police in the narrowestpossible terms.The Home Secretary informed the Cabinet that he had just received a telegram from the&apos;Chief Constable of Lancashire tothe effect that the members of his Police Force had been informedthat, a lightning strike was being arranged for the 19th July.The War Cabinet decided (a.) To adopt the financial recommendations regarding the pay of the Police Service, as recommended by LordDesboroughts Committee.(&amp;.) That the Police Bill should be considered by the HomeAffairs Committee on the following day, and, subjectto any amendments there agreed, the Bill should beintroduced into Parliament during the following week,and that Lord Hesborough&apos;s Report should be pub-lished simultaneously.(c.) That Sir Edward Troup should consult with theTreasury with regard to the recommendation of LordDesborough&apos;s Committee that the provision for theincreased cost of pay should be met by a direct supple-mentary grant from Imperial funds.(d.) That the Pensions Scale should not form part of thepresent Bill, as introduced.
The President of the Board of Education said, that, if thepensions were increased to old Naval pensioners, they would alsonave to be increased to schoolmasters. His attention had been drawn to the great hardships suffered by this class, but, as thequestion opened such a very wide door, he thought the previous decision of the Cabinet should be adhered to. &apos;,The War Cabinet decided To adhere to their previous decision.4. The War Cabinet took note of the memorandum by theShipping Controller (Paper G.T.-7596) and the memorandum bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer (Paper G.T.-7654) on theposition of the White Star Line and Associated Fleets.Position of theWhite Star line and AssociatedFleets.Naval review. 5. With reference to the proposed visit of the Members ofthe Houses of Parliament to the Fleet (War Cabinet 589,Minute 4), the First Lord stated that he was proceeding with thearrangements, and they would be carried out in the most economical manner possible. He undertook that no public announcement of the visit should be made until the following week.6. The Chancellor of the Exchequer read out a letter whichhe had received from the Secretary to the Committee of the LondonClearing Banks on the subject of the Ways and CommunicationsBill, representing that the Bill apparently took no account of theRailways Act of 1844. Mr. Chamberlain said that he had pre-pared a reply, and desired the approval of the Cabinet before itwas despatched.(Mr. Chamberlain then read his proposed reply.)The War Cabinet approved the proposed reply of theChancellor of the Exchequer to the letter he had receivedfrom the London Clearing Banks Committee (Appendix).Use of Government 7. With reference to War Cabinet 575, Minute 5, and WarMotor-Cars. Cabinet 581, Minute 2, the War Cabinet Had under consideration a note by the Acting Secretary (Paper G.T.-7635) circulating a return snowing the number of motor cars allptted to Governmentdepartments, the officials to whom they are allocated, and thepurposes for which they are required.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in his view, theWar Cabinet had first to consider whether Ministers were entitledto have motor cars at the public expense. He felt that ministers were entitled to special consideration. He himself had the use ofa car, which was supplied by the War Office, but whenever he didnot require it he instructed the chauffeur accordingly, and he understood that it was returned . to the general pool. In hisopinion, it was desirable that cars should be removed from thecontrol of the various departments and placed under a single department. A strictly limited number of cars might be allotted to each department (not to individuals), the number not to be exceeded except in very special circumstances. The department in charge of the general pool of cars ought to be the Ministry ofMunitions, and all users should be required to produce vouchersat the end of every journey.The First Lord of the Admiralty said, that the real difficulty was that, in the first place, Ministers took different views as tothe use that might be made of a Government car, and, in thesecond, the calls upon Ministers varied very considerably.

The Coal Industry.8. With reference to  War   Cabinet  589,  Minute 3, thePresident of the Board of Trade informed the War Cabinet that,0i in view of the general desire evinced the previous afternoon inthe House of Commons for fuller information in respect of thefacts which had influenced the Government in arriving at their decision to raise the price of coal by 6s. a ton, he proposed to[171] &apos; Che himself had been Colonial Minister there had been many occasions when lie had been unable to obtain a taxi, and hadconsequently been late for important engagements. He therefore asked for a car and used it for general purposes in the Depart-v ment.  Before the War there had been 10,000 taxis in London, and now there was not half that number, and he understood that therewas no prospect of the number being increased at present. Hethought that heads of departments were certainly entitled to theuse of a Government car, but that no rule could be laid down thatit was only to be used for official purposes. He suggested that theWar Cabinet should direct all departments to go again into thequestion of (a) the number, and (b) the type of car and the cost ofits maintenance, with a view to a drastic reduction of the number. at present in use. He wished to remind the Cabinet that, shortly after the outbreak of war, all military and naval officers on the active list were ordered to wear uniform. A naval officer of highrank, travelling by &apos;bus or Tube, might be placed in a very embarrassing position if he happened to be travelling in uniformin a public conveyance and was accosted by drunken soldiers orsailors.The Minister of Munitions recommended that all the oarsof an expensive type now in use should be sold; that there shouldbe one pool, under one Ministry, of cars for the use of government officials; and that these cars should all be of one type. If this last condition were fulfilled, the present expenditure would bereduced considerably.The President of the Board of Trade thought that it was essential that Ministers should have the use of a motor car of some kind. As the First Lord of the Admiralty had pointed out, itwas practically impossible to get a taxi, at any rate at short notice,and Ministers consequently had great difficulty in fulfilling their various engagements.Mr. Bonar Law said that the feeling both in Parliament and among the public generally was very strong indeed on the subject.He had been informed that few abuses were causing greater dis-content than the fact that junior officials of departments were seen passing through London in powerful cars, the upkeep ofwhich, was being maintained out of the public purse. He thoughtthat the War Cabinet generally were agreed that there should bea general pool under one department; that the users of cars (otherthan Ministers) should hand in vouchers after every journey per-formed; that the expensive type of car should be sold and a singleinexpensive type substituted; and that the department responsiblefor maintaining the pool should be the Ministry of Munitions.The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that he thought theywere also agreed that cars should be allocated to departments andnot to individual officers or officials.The First Lord of the Admiralty added that he understoodthat his colleagues also concurred in his view that departments should be directed rigorously to cut down the number of cars atpresent in use.The War Cabinet agreed that departments should be directeddrastically to reduce without delay the number of cars atpresent in use.(The discussion was adjourned.)
issue a paper reviewing the coal situation, and giving the figureson which his estimate of the increased price had been based. this paper was now in the course of preparation in his department,and would be ready shortly.The War Cabinet approved the proposal of the President ofthe Board of Trade.Increased Price of 9. The President of the Board of Trade   stated that   hisCommodities.       Department were being heavily pressed in regard to the increasing--           prices of practically every commodity.    He thought that someQuestion of Gov- action must be taken by the War Cabinet, and that it might beernment Control, necessary for a, statement to be made in the House on the following monday as to the Government&apos;s proposals. In his view, therewere two lines along which the War Cabinet might move: (a) TheGovernment itself might enter into competition with certaintrades, e.g., the woollen industry, and retail cloth at reasonable prices. This would entail a large expenditure on administration,and involve an entirely new departure; and (b) set up a seriesof tribunals which would determine fair prices in the differentlocalities and investigate specific complaints of profiteering. he himself favoured the second alternative. Briefly, his proposalamounted to this. Local tribunals should be established over thecountry to check retailers&apos; profits; that is to say, the tribunalswould investigate any complaint brought by a consumer aboutexcessive prices, and, if necessary, fix a limit. Secondly, the tribunals would be equally open to the examination of any com-plaints brought by the retailers as to the extortionate prices they,as middlemen, had to pay to the manufacturers. Thirdly, anycases which the tribunals&apos; felt that they were not competent to(decide on the spot should be referred to the Board of Trade, whowould set up ad, hoc bodies to investigate. The general intentionof the tribunals and the ad hoc bodies would be to secure thelimitation of the margin of profit. The Standard Suit scheme had failed because it had not been organised on a sufficiently extensive scale and adequately financed. If the Government were now toestablish a big clothing trust he thought it would be a hugefinancial success, but he realised that there were formidable diffi-culties in the way. A third alternative would be to remove allimport restrictions and to permit, e.g., Japanese cotton to comefreely into the country. The adoption of this proposal would havea great effect in reducing prices, but it would also undoubtedlyincrease unemployment. In the present circumstances it was practically impossible to stop profiteering; and in this connection he cited the case of the arrangements for handling fish at Billings-gate, whereby vanloads of good fresh fish were frequently returnedto the railways only to be returned to the market next day as stalefish. Fish ought to be cheaper now than it had ever been before.The railways were delivering it in great quantities at the Londontermini, but the Billingsgate merchants, by an ingenious manipula-tion, were preventing a great deal of it from reaching the public.He suggested that profiteering in this commodity might be checkedif the Government themselves were to establish large fish marketsat King&apos;s Cross and Euston. He had warned the merchants thatthe Government might be compelled to take some step of this kind,as well as to refuse to allow the subsidised lorries to go toBillingsgate.The Minister of Munitions thought that the question was mainly one of supply and demand. There was a great quantityof wool now in England, but lack of transport prevented its properdistribution, although lorries were being used as far as possible. .He thought that prices could only be lowered by a wider and more expeditious distribution of material. If it were possible to bringwool to the door of the manufacturers, prices were bound to fall.
Mr. Bonar Law thought that the War Cabinet might haveto proceed on the line of control. As regards&apos; Sir auckland geddes&apos; third alternative, that import restrictions might beremoved, there was no doubt that this, in the first instance, would increase unemployment, but he thought it would be difficult forthe Government to justify to the country the maintenance of thepresent high prices in order to prevent unemployment in certain industries. It was worth considering whether these restrictions should not be removed temporarily. He thought that in certain quarters in Parliament there was bound to be a demand for aninfluential Commission of Enquiry into the whole question. Sucha Commission, however, would not be able to report for some con-siderable time, and he agreed with the President of the Board ofTrade that the Government should take action without any delay.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he understoodthat the French Government had opened a limited number of stores under their control in Paris, and that the result had been an immediate fall in prices. As regards Sir Auckland Geddes&apos;proposal to establish local tribunals, he thought that if these latterfixed a price it might merely mean that supplies from outsidewould be cut off and diverted into a more profitable market.Mr. Barnes thought that the French experiment had been only temporarily successful.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the secondproposal of the President of the Board of Trade had been sug-gested early in the War, in the Cabinet of Mr. Asquith. The pro-ppsal had been that a mixed body, composed of members of thelocal Corporations and certain magistrates, should constitute a tribunal in order to hear complaints and have the right to reportto the Government. The proposal had not been accepted, as ithad been represented at the time that extensive legislation wouldbe required. He himself strongly supported the President of theBoard of Trade&apos;s suggestion, and thought that, if it were adopted,prices would come down within a week.The War Cabinet took note of the President of the Board ofTrade&apos;s suggestions, and asked him to develop them in greater detail and to submit them, for their closerexamination, at an early date.2.

APPENDIX. I %Correspondence between the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary tothe Committee of the London Clearing Banks.Letter from the Secretary to the Committee of the London Clearing Banks to theChancellor of the Exchequer.The Bankers&apos; Clearing House, Lombard Street, London, E.C.July 3, 1919.To the Rt. Hon. Austen Chamberlain, M.P.,Chancellor of the Exchequer.Sir,WAYS and Communications Bill.I am requested to advert to the correspondence which I had the honour of having with you in March and April last, and especially to the letter ctf Mr, Gowerdated the 7th April.The memorialists who addressed you in this correspondence have now had anopportunity of considering the Bill as it has emerged from the Committee stage inthe House of Commons. While they recognise that the situation is altered by the deletion from the Bill of the principal clause dealing with the acquisition of railwayundertakings, they still view with great concern the fact that the Governmentshould ever have thought themselves justified in introducing legislation on thissubject which apparently took no account whatever of the provisions of the RailwayRegulation Act, 1844, notwithstanding the undoubted fact that all subsequent issues of railway capital have been upon the basis of that provision. Section 4 of thisAct provides that no Bill shall be received in either House of Parliament unless incompliance, with the scheme of acquisition laid down by the Act, and theyrespectfully represent that the deletion of the most objectionable matter from theBill has not destroyed the effect of its introduction, and that complete confidencecan only be restored by an assurance on the part of the Government that in any future legislation on the subject fulj effect should be given to the provisions of thatAct relating to the terms of purchase.An excellent opportunity for such an assurance is given by the language of thefirst sub-section of Clause 7 of the Bill as it stands. This proviso refers to thequestion &quot; as to the principle on which the price to be paid upon acquisition by theState of railway undertakings is to be based,&quot; and if this is left as it stands it willconvey the impression that there is still a doubt in the minds of Parliament as towhat that principle should be. We suggest that this impression should be removed by adding to the clause an amendment distinctly providing that in the event df anysuch acquisition effect shall be given to the provisions of the Act of 1844.I am, &amp;c,(Signed)      ROBERT HOLLAND MARTIN,Hon. Secretary.Letter from the Chancellor of the Exchequer to the Secretary to the Committee ofthe London Clearing Banks.Treasury Chambers, Whitehall, S.W.1.Dear Sir, July 10, 1919.I BEG to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant and regret that pressure of work has prevented me from sending you an earlier reply.There is some inconvenience in your addressing me upon a subject which comes within the immediate competence of another Minister, but in deference to the
important institutions which you represent I will reply directly instead of referringyou to my colleague.You recognise that the deletion from the Bill now before Parliament of theclause dealing with the acquisition of railway undertakings has altered the situationand leaves Parliament free to deal with this question on its merits if and when itarises.You nevertheless ask that I should give on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s government an undertaking that if Parliament decides at some future time that the railwayundertakings should be purchased by the State, the purchase will take place onlyon the terms authorised by the Act of 1844. This is a promise which the Governmenthave no authority to give and no power to fulfil. It would purport to limit the discretion of this or it may be future Parliaments in dealing with the subject. Allthat I can do is to repeat the assurance that I have already given to othermemorialists that His Majesty&apos;s Government would not in any case propose theacquisition except on terms which are fair to the shareholders.But I am bound to call your attention to the opening words of Clause 4 of theAct of 1844 which you appear to have overlooked:- &quot; Whereas it is expedient that the policy of revision or purchase should inno manner be prejudged by the provisions of this Act, but should remain forthe future consideration of the Legislature upon the ground of general national policy .... be it enacted that no such notice as hereinbefore mentionedwhether of revision or purchase, shall be given until provision shall have beenmade by Parliament by an Act or Acts to be passed in that behalf . . . .&quot;The Act of 1844 itself thus expressly safeguards the future rights ofParliament, and I cannot accept the view suggested in youtr letter that it offered anindefeasible guarantee of particular terms on which all subsequent subscriptionsof capital have been made.This view was clearly expressed by the Joint Committee on RailwayAmalgamation of 1872, which reported that &quot; Whatever value there may be in the notice given to the Companies bythe Act of &apos;44 of their liability to purchase by the State, its terms do not appearsuited to the present position of railway property or likely to be adopted byParliament in case it intends at any future time to purchase the railways.&quot;Yours faithfully,(Signed)      AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN.
