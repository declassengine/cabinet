2Peace Celebrations 1. Lord Curzon, speaking as Chairman of the War Cabinet(Catafalque). Committee on Peace Celebrations, said, with reference to WarCabinet 587, Minute 2, that his Committee had gathered that therewas considerable feeling against the idea of adopting the french proposal to have a catafalque on the processional route whichwould be saluted by the troops as they passed, in honour of thedead. The King was not in favour of the idea, and objectionshad been raised in other quarters. Pie had, however, as desired by the War Cabinet, referred the matter to his Committee, whohad carefully considered this proposal as well as possible alterna-tives. The First Commissioner of Works had prepared sketches,which would be laid before the W&quot;ar Cabinet. If the Cabinetadopted the idea of a temporary shrine, he himself inclined to a simple pylon, which he thought might be made sufficiently impres-sive. The reasons against the proposal were, that it was foreignto the temper and custom of the nation; that it might not be easy for the public to assume a properly reverential attitude; and, asthe structure would be of a very temporary character, it must be carefully safeguarded or it would be overturned and trampled onin the crush. The most suitable spot on the ceremonial route toplace the structure was, in the opinion of his Committee, in whitehall, almost opposite Downing Street.The Prime Minister said that he deprecated a nationalrejoicing which did not include some tribute to the dead. If theWar Cabinet approved the suggestion of a pylon, he thought itmust be sufficiently high to be impressive. He suggested that theFirst Commissioner of Works might consult one or two well-knownarchitects on the subject, and ask them to submit alternativesketches. He himself was quite prepared to accept any sketchwhich might be approved by Lord Curzon and the first commissioner.After a brief discussion, in the course of which Ministersgenerally expressed their approval of the idea of having a pylonon the line of march, the War Cabinet decided That a temporary pylon, of a pattern to be approved by theFirst Commissioner and Lord Curzon, should be erectedin Whitehall to be saluted by the troops as they passed in the military procession on the 19th instant.Expenditure. Lord Curzon said that the second question on which he required a decision of the War Cabinet was the sum to be allottedfor purposes of street decorations and fireworks on the day ofPeace Celebrations. Pie had himself thought of asking for theirsanction for the sum of 25,000Z. to be spent on decorations exclu-sive of fireworks. He was informed, however, by the First Com-missioner of Works that this amount was hardly adequate, in viewof the fact that prices had more than doubled since the beginningof the war. As regards fireworks, Messrs. Brock had been askedto submit an estimate, which amounted to 2O,000Z. He himselfthought this amount was excessive.The First Commissioner of Works said that the expenditure was required, not only to cover the cost of street decorations, butalso for sanitary and ambulance stations. It must also cover the structure of a Royal dais and of stands for Members of bothHouses of Parliament, if the Cabinet decided that such standsshould be constructed. He asked, therefore, the sanction of theWar Cabinet for the sum of 50.000Z. to 60,000Z. to be placed at his disposal, to be expended according to his discretion. On formeroccasions stands for Members of Parliament had been put up, a charge &quot;for seats being made, sufficient to cover the cost of theerection.The Secretary of State for War thought that Members ofParliament had an absolute right to see the procession. On theother hand, a considerable number of Members could not beexpected to pay extravagant prices for seats.   He thought that a
River Procession.Participation ofAllied Troops.nominal charge might be made to cover a part of the cost, theremainder being found out of the funds allotted to the first commissioner.Mr. Bonar Law agreed with Lord Curzon that 20,000Z. was an extravagant price to pay for fireworks. The display should,of course, be on an adequate scale, but the cost must not be excessive.Mr. Barnes hoped that the whole of the money allotted forfireworks would not be expended on a display in Hyde Park, andhe suggested there should be a simultaneous display somewhere inthe East End, e.g., at the People&apos;s Palace or Victoria Park.The First Commissioner of Works was of opinion that itwould be preferable to have a really impressive display in hyde park to distributing the money in organising minor displays invarious parts of London.The War Cabinet decided (a.) That there should be one display of fireworks, in hyde park, on the evening of the 19th instant, if arrange-ments for the accommodation of men of- variousfighting services, British and Allied, admitted of this being given.(6.) That the First Commissioner of Works should arrange with Messrs. Brock for the display, which should beon an adequate but not unduly extravagant scale.(c.) That, subject to the approval of the Chancellor of theExchequer, a sum, not exceeding 60,000Z. in the firstinstance, should be placed at the disposal of the first commissioner of Works, to cover the cost of decorated-tions, sanitary and ambulance services, &amp;c, on the19th July, 1919; the First Commissioner to obtain thesanction of the War Cabinet to any further expendi-ture that he might find necessary.Lord Curzon reported to the War Cabinet that, after due consideration, his Committee had decided that the idea of a riverprocession on the Thames, to be held on the afternoon of the 19thJuly, 1919, must be abandoned. His Committee now contemplated the participation of representatives of the Mercantile Marine inthe&apos;ceremonial processions through the streets of London on the morning of that date.The War Cabinet took note of Lord Curzon&apos;s statement.The Secretary of State for War said that the point had been raised recently in the LTouse of Commons as to whether it wouldbe possible for the French troops to take part in the military pro-cessions. He himself thought that there would be no difficulty in bringing a small contingent of French soldiers over from France,and he suggested that he should be authorised to telegraph to theFrench Minister of War asking if arrangements could be madeaccordingly. He wished to draw the attention of the War Cabinetto the fact that French troops taking part in the MilitaryTournament at Olympia had received a great ovation. He was aware that objections might be raised to the participation of theFrench troops to the exclusion of representatives of other allied armies, apart from the Americans. He himself did not see any difficulty in meeting these objections.Lord Curzon stated that he had seen Field-Marshal sir douglas Haig on the subject of the military processions theprevious evening. The Field-Marshal appeared to object very strongly to the participation of French troops. It would be impos-sible in the Field-Marshal&apos;s view to get them in any considerable numbers, and this might give rise to invidious distinctions.Moreover, Sir Douglas Haig had expressed the view that theFrench troops might not be given a suitable reception, and, further,Americans were of our blood whereas the French were not.
Lord Curzon also said that he had recently spoken to AdmiralBeatty in regard to the naval contingent to take part in the pro-cession. The admiral had pointed out that his sailors would regard their inclusion in the procession less as a compliment than as a hardship. It would involve very early rising and a long andtiring day for them, unless they could be accommodated for the night in hostels or elsewhere. In any case, it was desirable to consult their comfort, and show them attention in every possible way. Supposing it were decided that representatives of thevarious armies of the different Allies should be accommodated inHyde Park, it would mean that the park would be denied to thepublic for purposes of festivities on the day of the celebrations.The J?rime Minister did not agree with the view7 of sir douglas Haig. In any case, this was a political rather than amilitary question, although, of course, every consideration wouldbe given to the opinion of the military authorities. In his viewr,it did not matter whether there were many or few French troopsparticipating. There would, after all, be only a comparativelyfew British troops taking part in the great Allied military pro-cession which is to take place in Paris on the 14th instant. Pieagreed with Mr. Churchill that the French troops would probably have a very cordial reception, and he suggested that the Secretaryof State for War should be authorised to telegraph, to M. Clemen-Clemenceau, in the sense suggested by Mr. Churchill. Pie was further infavour of trying to have both Italian cavalry and sailors includedin the procession, as well as some representatives of the Dominionarmies.Lord Curzon hoped that the Belgians would not be forgotten.If it was proposed to have representatives of the Allied armies, hewas in favour of including them all. Pie was glad to be able toinform the War Cabinet that a contingent of Indian troops ofvarious classes was now on its way to England, and would arrive in this country just in time to take its place in the procession.The First Sea Lord said that the arrangements for the par-ticipation of representatives of the Fleet had not been finally settled. Admiral Madden (Commander-in-Chief Atlantic and home Fleets) had informed him that he was opposed to havingBritish sailors in London for the night.The First Lord of the Admiralty and the Secretary of Statefor War, in regard to the point raised by Lord Curzon, said thatthey did not anticipate any difficulty in making suitable arrange-ments for the accommodation of soldiers and sailors in London.The arrangements were well in hand, and special consideration was being given to food and the comfort of the men.The Prime Minister said that he welcomed the idea of the participation of the representatives of as many Allied armies aspossible in the procession. Such participation would have an excellent effect and emphasise the solidarity of the Entente.Mr. Bonar Law enquired whether it would be desirable ornecessary that any French General of high .standing should accompany the small French contingent which, it appeared, it was proposed should form part of the procession. In regard to thedate fixed for the celebrations, he said that on the 19th July, the glasgow annual &quot; fair &quot; holiday began and on that day, therefore,there would be a great exodus of working people from the city.Lord Curzon replied that in promulgating to the Empire the dates selected by His Majesty&apos;s Government for peace celebrations,it was expressly stated that it&quot; was hoped that all local authorities throughout the Empire would conform, but that they would, ofcourse, be free to arrange the date most convenient to them.The War Cabinet decided To ask the Secretary of State for War to go into the questionof the participation of representative contingents ofDominion and Allied troops in the military processionson the 19th July, 1919; Mr. Churchill to keep in close
Trading with ^- ^ne War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the germany. President of the Board of Trade (G.T.-7610) relative to trading with Germany.The President of the Board of Trade said that the first thinghe proposed to do, on the raising of the blockade, was to remove the prohibitions on trading with Germany under &quot; Trading withthe Enemy&apos;&apos; legislation. As regards imports from Germany itwas a condition of the licences under which limited quantities ofprohibited imports are admitted that the goods brought in shouldnot be of German manufacture, and he. proposed that this condition should continue to be enforced until the 1st Septembernext. Agreements had, however, been made with our Allies andNeutrals to allow the import of limited quantities of prohibitedarticles, and he doubted the legality of such discrimination as that proposed.The Prime Minister pointed out that he did not think any legal question should arise until the ratification of the peace treaty.The President of the Board of Trade said that it was theopinion of two Law Officers of the Crown, that it was not open tothe Crown to discriminate against imports from any particular country in granting licences. The Government had already agreed to the import of certain fixed quantities.Mr. Bonar Law thought that if goods on the prohibited listof German manufacture were to be admitted the whole arrange -ment would break down.The War Cabinet approved the proposals of the President ofthe Board of Trade, and decided that for the time being a condition of the licences under which limited quantitiesof prohibited imports are admitted, should be that thegoods brought in should not be of German manufacture.Congestion of Ports 3. With reference to War Cabinet 552, Minute 6, and 5b5,in^the United Minute 5, the War Cabinet had before them Memoranda byKingdom. Sir A. Norman Hill (G.T.-7333), the President of the Board ofTrade (G.T.-7483), and the Food Controller (G.T.-7558), relative to the congestion of ports in the United Kingdom.The Prime Minister said that this matter was very urgent; hewould like to know what was the opinion of the Law Officers ofthe Crown as to making a regulation under the Defence of the realm Act.The President of the Board of Trade replied that the LawOfficers had confirmed the views he had already expressed to theCabinet, which were to the effect that a regulation under theDefence of the Realm Act would not be legal (G.T.-7617).The Prime Minister said it consequently appeared as if itwould be necessary to wait for the Ways and Communications Billto be put on the Statute Book.The President of the Board of Trade suggested that thesituation might be met by passing a special measure before the recess giving the necessary powers to raise the railway rates.The Prime Minister thought that such a course would meandelay rather than the reverse, as any such measure would meet with considerable opposition in the blouse of Commons. It wouldalso have the effect of delaying the passing into law of the ways and Communications Bill. This Bill would reach the report stageon the following Monday, and he did not see why it should not[126] Ctouch with the War Cabinet Committee on PeaceCelebrations on the subject, and to communicate to them the result of his enquiries at the earliest possible date.
then be hurried through. Moreover, he doubted if any specialmeasure could be got through under a fortnight or three weeks.Mr. Bonar Law agreed in the views expressed by the PrimeMinister. He said that the House of Commons knew that theexisting congestion was due to the increased amount of goods which had to be transported, but the moment any proposal wasmade to raise the rates there would be considerable opposition.Sir Eric Geddes agreed that there might be a certain amountof opposition in the House of Commons to a special measure. Hethought, however, that everyone realised that the rates were boundto rise. If, however, it was pointed out that it was a matter of vital urgency to pass a special measure in order to relieve the congestion he thought this opposition might be easily overcome.Moreover he doubted if anything could be done by means of the ways and Communications Bill for some time to come. until this Bill was passed he had no powers to set up the Advisory and statutory Committees which would be necessary.Mr. Bonar Law suggested that it might be possible to arrangefor this to be done without waiting until the Bill became law.The President of the Board of Trade gave as an example ofthe difference between railway rates and coasting charges the caseof some timber which had just been landed from Montreal. the coasting charges to transport this timber to London would be 509Z.,whereas the railway rates were only 206/. Pie would like to pointout that a very large number of rates would have to be dealt with,and he thought the only practical way of doing so would be to havea percentage increase. The only other alternative would be acoastal service of Government steamers and an arrangement tocarry stores in the most convenient way. Pie would also like toraise the question of placing at the disposal of the railwaycompanies the Government railway wagons which were available.The Prime Minister agreed in the desirability of placing thewagons at the disposal of the companies.The Minister of Munitions said, with reference to the proposalto use Government lorries, that unless the bulk cargoes were sent by coasting vessels he thought the scheme would fail, as the roadswere bad and the lorries small.Mr. Bonar Law said that the difficulty raised by the ShippingController was how to discriminate between goods to be sent by rail and those to be sent by sea.The President of the Board of Trade presumed that theGovernment could receive goods for transit, and send them by sea or land as most convenient.Mr. Bonar Law thought it might be left to the railwaycompanies, or else the Shipping Controller coiw arrange with thecompanies which was the best way of transporting goods.Sir Eric Geddes pointed out that railways could notdiscriminate between goods without statutory powers, but perhapsthis point need not be pressed in as much as the railways were under State control.At this point the Shipping Controller entered and the PrimeMinister explained to him the stage reached in the discussion, andthat it appeared as if some temporary expedient such as the chartering by the Government of coastal steamers, and the use of motor lorries would be necessary in order to relieve the congestion.Sir Eric Geddes hoped that no one contemplated a reductionin the passenger railway rates, which were now 50 per cent, morethan pre-war rates.Sir Norman Hill pointed out that the proposal to chartervessels raised the question of the Governments powers to ordertraffic offered to the railways to be forwarded coastwise.The Minister of Munitions said that it would be possible tosupply at once 1,000 motor lorries provided arrangements couldbe made at the docks to use them; and in reply to a remark*by theShipping Controller suggested that the lorries might be put at the
Future Constitution With reference to War Cabinet 587, Minute 5, the war of the Supreme        Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by Lord Robert CecilEconomic Council.    (G.T.-7613) submitting proposals for a system of internationalconsultation in economic matters.Lord Robert Cecil said that this question had arisen inconsequence of a resolution adopted by the Council of Four attheir meeting on the 28th June. In accordance with this resolution the Supreme Economic Council were requested to suggest for theconsideration of the several Governments the methods which wouldbe most serviceable for ensuring international consultation in economic matters. The proposals for the constitution of anInternational Economic Council, which were attached to his memorandum, had been drawn up so that Mr. Wise could take them back to Paris on the 5th instant. He wanted, therefore, toget a, decision of the Cabinet as to their general agreement to thepolicy indicated in the proposals. Pie had shown the proposals to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the President of the Boardof Trade, who were in agreement with them._ The Prime Minister asked where it was proposed that theInternational Economic Council should meet&apos;? It appeared to himdoubtful whether the different countries would be prepared toappoint two ministers to sit on the proposed Council.Lord Robert Cecil said that it was proposed that the council should normally meet in London. It would not, however, have tomeet every week, but would have a permanent executive committeewhich would sit frequently and deal with questions as had beenclone by the Maritime Transport Council. He added, in reply toa question by the Prime Minister, that it was proposed that theCouncil should deal not only with raw materials and food, but also with financial problems.Lord Curzon asked if our Allies were prepared to send representatives to London?Lord Robert Cecil replied that the Italians were desirous thatthe Council should meet in London, and the French were ready todisposal of the railway companies. He was in favour of theproposal to charter ships.The President of the Board of Trade pointed out that the congestion at some ports was very much worse than at others. Forinstance at Glasgow, Liverpool, and London, it was very bad,whereas at Hull, Leith, and some other parts, the situation wasnot so serious.The Shipping Controller thought that this must always bethe case, and that Liverpool, London and Glasgow, would always have to be used more than the others owing to the distributivemachinery at these large ports.Mr. Bonar Law said that what appeared to be wanted wasthe general right to send in whatever way was most convenient,whether by sea or land, any goods handed to the RailwayCompanies for transport, and this could be stipulated on therailway note.Pie suggested that the President of the Board of Trade,Sir Eric Geddes and the Shipping Controller might meet together and formulate a plan.The War Cabinet decided that: (a) Arrangements should be made as early as practicable forthe surplus Government Railway Wagons to be pooledunder the Board of Trade, and placed at the disposalof the Railway Companies.(&amp;) Sir Eric Geddes, the President of the Board of Trade andthe Shipping Controller should meet and prepare anemergency plan for making- use of coasting vessels (ata loss if necessary) in order to relieve the existingcongestion of Railways.
agree. As regards the United States, they also were in favour ofLondon.The Food Controller concurred in the proposed constitution&apos;of the Economic Council as suggested in Lord Robert Cecil&apos;sMemorandum.The &quot;War Cabinet approved generally of the proposals contained in Lord Robert&quot; Cecil&apos;s Memorandum for theconstitution of an International Economic Council.Minimum Eates of ^&apos; &quot;^&quot;^h refercnce to War Cabinet 573, Minute 5, the WarWages Commission Cabinet had before them the rates of Wages Commission DraftDraft Bill Bill with a covering explanatory memorandum by the Ministerof Labour (Paper G.T.-7606).The Minister of Labour said that the Bill proposed that aCommission should be constituted to enquire into and report onminimum rates of wages and for purposes connected therewith.The terms of the Bill had been adjusted after considerablenegotiations with the Provisional Joint Committee of theIndustrial Conference consisting of equal numbers of employersand workmen. It was proposed to the Joint Committee that theCommission should not be empowered to fix minimum rates ofwages, but that they should enquire as to the basis on which suchrates should be fixed, regard being had to the cost of living and toall other relevant matters. It was suggested that the scope ofthe enquiry should be limited to men and women over 18 yearsof age employed in trade, and industry. These proposals,however, were not accepted by the Joint Committee, and after several discussions on the point at issue, they continued to press for the following revisions: (a) That the Bill shall apply to all adults and young persons.(b) That the minimum rates shall be such as to provide an.adequate living wage.(c) That the Commission&apos; shall have the power to decide what those rates shall be, subject to their subsequentenactment by Parliament.The Bill, therefore, contained in its preamble a declaration that it was expedient that minimum rates of wages should befixed for all persons over the age of 18 years, and should be fixed at such amounts that all such persons would be afforded anadequate living wage. He would like to mention that theprinciple of an adequate living wage was approved in the LabourSection of the Peace Treaty. As to young persons, the Billdeclared that it was expedient that minimum time rates shouldbe fixed for young persons aged 15 years and not more than18 years of age. It was, of course, impossible to state that wages for young persons should be fixed so as to provide an adequateliving wage. He had had some difficulty in inducing the JointCommittee to agree that the Commission should restrictthemselves to enquiry regarding rates cf wages, as -they desired that the Commission should have power to fix rates which shouldhave legislative sanction. Eventually, however, they had agreedthat the Bill should, provide that the Report of the commisioners should be laid as soon as might be before both Houses of Parlia-ment, and that the question of further legislation would dependon the nature of the Commissioners&apos; Report.Regarding the constitution of the Commission, although itwas not specifically provided in the Bill, it was proposed that representatives of the employers and workmen should beappointed to be members. The Joint Committee had agreed tothe appointment of independent members, one of whom would be chairman. The Commission would, therefore, consist of threerepresentatives of the employers, three of the workmen, and threeindependent members appointed by the Government including the
4 nx UHours of Employ- ^&apos;        War Cabinet had before them a draft of the &quot; Hoursment of  Employment&quot; Bill with a covering  memorandum  by the__ Ministry of Labour (G.T.-7607).Draft of a Bill. The Minister of Labour said that it. would be rememberedthat the provisional Joint Committee of the National industrial conference had recommended the early introduction of legislationfixing 48 hours as the normal maximum working week for allemployed persons. This Bill, with certain exceptions, carriedout this recommendation. In his negotiations he had endeavoured,to get the Joint Committee to experiment with a 48 hours week in industrial trades alone, but they would not agree to this. all industries and trades, including agriculture, were covered by theBill. In most of the great industries already, by agreement,48 hours or less were being worked, and other classes of industries which were sufficiently organised could take advantage of theprovision of the Act for variation of the maximum or for theinstitution of necessary overtime by agreement. He would pointout, however, that under paragraph 2 (sub-section 2) of the Bill,the Minister was possessed of wide powers to grant exceptions onhis own initiative or at the instance of any persons concerned.The Committee had already agreed to the exclusion of domestic servants and seamen and persons in positions of supervision.The President of the Board of Agriculture said that hisindustry could not live under this Bill, although he recognisedthat sufficient elasticity was given in the Bill to except agricultureeither wholly or partially. He would have preferred, however,that agriculture should be specially excluded from the Bill. he feared that farmers and labourers would read little further thanthe first clause of the Bill, in which it was stated that a 48 hour week was to be the general, rule and this would provoke an agitation immediately.The Secretary for Scotland agreed with Lord Ernie and saidthat so far as agriculture was concerned the Bill was quiteunworkable. One of the results would be that land under tillagewould be turned to grass. An attempt had been made in scotland to arrange a 50 hour week for agricultural labourers but it had failed.Mr. Barnes said that when the Labour Charter had been drawn up in Paris an attempt had been made by the Italians toinclude agriculture in the statutory hours week but allamendments to this effect had been defeated and agriculture wasnot included in the Charter.Chairman. The Cabinet, therefore, had before them an agreedBill.Mr. Barnes asked whether the trade unionists had agreedto sub-section (b) paragraph 1 in the Terms of Reference underwhich they were to make recommendations as to the methods andsuccessive steps by which minimum time rates of wages shouldbe brought into operation, and the machinery by which they mightbe varied when occasion required. He had no hesitation inendorsing this himself, but thought that trade unionists might make trouble.The Minister of Labour replied that the trade unionistshad agreed to this reference. He would like to add, although theCabinet were probably aware of the fact, that the Triple Alliancehad refused to take part in the Industrial Conference, andtherefore in all the negotiations which he had had with theCommittee this body had not been represented.The War Cabinet decided To approve of the introduction of the Minimum rates ofWages Commission Bill into Parliament.
In reply to a question by the President of the Board ofTrade whether house surgeons and nurses would come within thescope of the Bill, Sir P. Borne stated that nurses only were included.The Minister of Labour said that he had tried very hard toget agriculture excluded, but had he persisted the whole of thenegotiations would have broken down. He would point out thatthe position as regards agriculture had, in fact, already beengiven away, as the Wages Board had laid down that the weeklynours for agricultural labourers should be 54 in summer and 48in winter and any hours over and above should be paid overtime.He would point out that the Bill did not prevent work above 48hours a week but laid down that any addition should be paid for as overtime. He would also like to mention that the applicationof the Bill to agriculture would be covered by the section he hadalready mentioned (paragraph 2, sub-section 2) where theMinister if he thought fit, might prescribe a higher or lowernumber of hours than 48 and grant total or partial exemption from the provisions of the Act.Mr. Barnes asked whether this section carried overtime.The Minister of Labour replied that overtime would only bepaid above the hours fixed either by the Act or by the Minister.The Prime Minister said he thought that agriculture shouldbe excluded from the Bill. There was a Royal Commissionabout to be appointed to enquire into the costs of productionin agriculture, and as this Commission had on it representativesof agricultural labourers, he thought that the Minister of Labourmight promise the Joint Committee that the question of agricul-ture would be referred to this Commission. Agriculture was an exceptional trade and he thought the Joint Committee had not fully realised the consequences of applying to it the generalrale of the 48 hour week. Farmers had had a good deal toput up with. Before the war they had paid as low as 14s. aweek to their labourers and they w7ere now paying as high as50s. On top of this they were asked to grant a 48 hour week.It had been mentioned that the Bill would have to be explained to farmers, but in his opinion any Bill that had to be explained was a bad Bill. He thought the Minister of labour should say to the Joint Committee that he had put up the besttight he could but the Cabinet were unanimously against theinclusion of agriculture, and their attention might also be drawn to the Labour Charter in which agriculture was not included.The War Cabinet decided (a) To approve of the introduction of the Hours ofEmployment Bill with the exclusion of its applicationto agriculture.(6) That the question of a statutory working hour weekshould be referred to the Royal Commission on thequestion of costs of production in agriculture and thatthe Minister of Labour should endeavour to obtainthe agreement of the Joint Committee of the national industrial Conference to this course.Overseas Trade (In- 7. The War Cabinet had before them a draft of the Overseassurance against Trade (Insurance Against Abnormal Risks) Bill with a coveringAbnormal Risks) memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade (PaperBill. G.T.-7580).Sir Arthur Steel Maitland said that in this Bill powers weresought to promote British Trade in those portions of Europewhere the disturbed political conditions arising from the Warstill constituted a serious and incalculable risk which Britishmerchants were unable to insure against.     What was proposed
was that the State (acting through the existing machinery of theWar Risks Insurance Office) should provide facilities for theinsurance of overseas trade of the United Kingdom with those areas. In trade with certain portions of Russia merchants ranthe risk of the capture of their goods by Bolshevists. In theordinary way this insurance would be carried by Lloyd&apos;s, but inthis case Lloyd&apos;s had said that they had not sufficient information to give insurance. Lloyd&apos;s were quite willing, therefore, that itshould be undertaken by the Government and as soon as possiblethey would undertake the risk themselves. Such a course would,as a matter of fact, benefit Lloyd&apos;s, as the Bill did not contemplateinsurance against marine risks, and encouraging our trade withRussia would have the effect of bringing more marine insurance to Lloyd&apos;s.The Prime Minister said he doubted the advisability of introducing such a Bill, and thought that the insurance might becarried out without, a Bill; all the President of the Board ofTrade had to do would be to put down a vote with anote explaining what the vote was for, and it would then go through in the Consolidated Fund Bill. Such a course wouldgive the President of the Board of Trade all he desired.The War Cabinet decided: (a) That the State should provide facilities for the insurance of the overseas trade of the United Kingdom in themanner indicated in the President of the Board ofTrade&apos;s Memorandum, but that it was not necessaryto introduce a Bill for this purpose.(b) That the President of the Board of Trade should giveeffect to (a) by means of a vote and not by a Bill.2,Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.July 4, 1919.
