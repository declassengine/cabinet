1. Sir Maurice Hankey asked permission to place on record hisdeep appreciation and thanks for the very generous reward &quot;whichthe Government had seen fit to recommend His Majesty the King togrant him for his services in the War.2. The War Cabinet authorised the Chancellor of the exchequer to introduce the Public Works Loans Bill in Parliament.Draft Bill to 3. The War Cabinet had before them advance copies of a DraftCheck Profiteering.   Bill to check profiteering.The Prime Minister said that it was important to arrive at asatisfactory definition of the word &quot; profiteering,&quot; and it bad beensuggested that it should be defined as that which is &quot;unreasonable.&quot;The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought the same phraseologymight be used as in the case of the Moneylenders Act.The Minister of Transport pointed out that Local Tribunals were bound to be partially prejudiced, as practically everybody in thecountry was making profits, and it would be difficult to agree as towhat was &quot;reasonable.&quot;The Secretary of State for India enquired what the penaltieswere which were authorised under the Act, and if there was any right of appeal.The President of the Board of Trade replied that, under theDraft Bill, the Local Tribunals could impose a fine up to 201. TheCourts of Summary Jurisdiction could inflict a fine up to 200Z., ortwice the value of the goods. There was no appeal from a Court of summary Jurisdiction. Any retailer, however, might appeal from theLocal Tribunal on a point of law, viz., that his plea that his charges were not unreasonable was valid. The whole of Part II, &quot;Powersof the Board of Trade as to profiteering in general,&quot; was really basedon the recommendations of the Committee on Trusts, which hadbeen sitting for months. In reply to a question, he said that all the officials he had consulted were agreed that the procedure laid downin Part I would work.The Minister of Plealth thought it important to avoid &apos;anyinequality in regard to decisions taken by the Tribunals. It waspossible that quite different decisions would be reached in localitiesadjoining each other. He suggested therefore that, in order toextend the area from which experts would be drawn, these should bemade as wide as possible.The Prime Minister was of opinion that the Act should betemporary only, and should not have effect for more than a .year.. &apos; It would be necessary to explain to the House of Commons why theGovernment had to introduce it before the Profiteering Committee&apos;could make its Report. The reason was, of course, that they saw no chance of receiving an Interim Report from the Committee in time for the House to act upon it.The Secretary of State for War expressed the view that theBill embodied. an extraordinary principle, and he had no idea whatthe Country would say to it. It was apparently intended to treat. every business transaction in the country on the same lines as if itwere conducted by an usurious moneylender : and he enquired whatwas to be done in respect of the vast millions made by the greatcaptains of industry throughout the war.The Secretary of State for India thought that the Bill as, it stood at present discriminated against the man in a small way ofbusiness.The President of the Board of Trade replied that the Bill appliedequally to the. big manufacturer and the small retailer. &apos; Themachinery for dealing with the wholesale manufacturers was outlined in Part II, and had been most carefully thought out.    In reply to aPublic works loans. Bill.
3WO 607question by the Secretary of State for India, he said that the bigmanufacturers could be sentenced to imprisonment after their case had been carefully investigated.The Secretary of State for India insisted that this involvedunfairness of a serious nature. It was apparently intended that the big men should only be liable to imprisonment after their cases hadbeen carefully examined, while no such favour was shown to thesmall retailer.The President of the Board of Trade said that the LocalTribunals must be trusted to deal out common justice and sense.They would be composed of the same type of men as constituted ourordinary Local Authorities.The Minister of Health remarked that Part II of the Bill was directed against the big Trusts, and he thought it desirable that thisshould be pushed through quickly.The Prime Minister was of opinion that the Bill was of tooambitious a character. What was required, he thought, was a smallBill to deal with the profiteers on a large scale, and that the house should be informed that, in the short time at the disposal of theGovernment, it was not possible to put through a Bill which should deal with every case of small profiteering throughout the country. if one or two big profiteers could be made an example of, he thoughtthat this would have an admirable effect in checking profiteeringgenerally.The Secretary of State for War thought it would be impossibleto define &quot; profiteering &quot; satisfactorily for the purposes of the Bill,For instance, the Ministry of&quot; Munitions was now selling for about ,000Z. a Rolls-Royce car which had been bought before the war for1,400Z.The Prime Minister repeated that it would be out of thequestion to get the Flouse of Commons to accept, in the course of a fortnight, so comprehensive and far-reaching a measure. Hesuggested that there should be a short Bill, of a summary character,devised to impose a check for the next few months, -until the commons Committee on Profiteering could report. The Committeeshould be informed accordingly, and should be asked, therefore, tocontinue their services.Sir Eric Geddes suggested that, the powers of the Bill should extend over a period of not more than six months.The Secretary of State for War said that the Bill was obviouslya purely emergency measure, designed to satisfy the populardemand.The President of the Board of Trade said it was a rough, but very effective, method of letting the light in. His proposal to establishsome 2,000 tribunals all over the country would, he believed, act asa huge and valuable propagandist machine.The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested that Local Tribunalsshould not have powers of punishment. His view was that theyshould be merely a kind of coroners inquest, and should refer badcases which came to their notice to the local magistrates.The President of the Board of Trade thought it was necessaryto grant powers of inflicting penalties to the Local Tribunals, or themembers would lose all interest in their duties.The Minister of Health agreed with the Chancellor of theExchequer that it was undesirable that a Local Tribunal should beempowered to act as a court of justice. It should have authorityto tell the retailer to what extent he must limit his profit, but itshould not be empowered to inflict punishment.The Prime Minister took the case of a small draper, who would represent to a Local Tribunal that he was not making more than10 per cent, profit. He understood that the matter would then bereferred to the Central Tribunal, who would carry the matter further and see whether the unreasonable price of the article was due to theexorbitant profits of the wholesale manufacturer.   In his opinion,
the country generally would not stand Government Departmentssettling exactly what price each little shopkeeper must place upon his goods.The Secretary of State for War agreed that what was required was a very short Bill, creating emergency powers to be held in reserve.The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought that the MoneylendersAct, as he had already suggested, afforded a useful precedent. Headhered to the view that only Magistrates or Petty Sessions shouldbe able to inflict penalties.The Prime Minister agreed that Local Tribunals should administerrebukes, where necessary, but that the question of penalties shouldbe left to the Magistrates or&apos; Petty Sessions. Plenary powers couldnot be given to the Local Tribunals. The elaborate provisions itwas proposed to introduce to deal with Trusts he thought must he introduced later. He suggested that the Bill might be re-drafted in simple and rough outline providing emergency powers, in such away that it would be open for the House of Commons to build it upby way of amendments.The Secretary of State for War reminded the War Cabinet thatprofits were the mainspring of industry, and that it would be amatter of great difficulty to distinguish between permissible andunwarrantable profit.The War Cabinet decided that The President of the Board of Trade should re-draft the Billin the light of the above discussion.4. The Minister of Health represented that it was necessaryfor him to have financial authority to deal directly with the HousingCommission under the new powers. He had come to a satisfactoryunderstanding on the subject with the London Councils.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, at his request, a treasury official had been to the Ministry of Health in order to go into the question, and he hoped that the War Cabinet would arriveat no decision until he was in possession of the Treasury officialsreport. *The War Cabinet decided-To postpone the question until the Chancellor of the exchequer was prepared to discuss it.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,August 7, 1919.o
