1. The Secretary of State for War stated that some membersof the Police Force, who had been discharged in connection with therecent strike, were trying to join the army, and he wished to havethe guidance of the Cabinet in the matter. Ordinary employers were not likely to employ these men, and it was undesirable thatthey should remain out of work and actively engaged in fomentingtrouble. If they joined the army, many of them would be sent toserve abroad for one, two, or three years.The Home Secretary said the matter was one of some difficulty,and care should be taken to enquire into the past history of the menwho sought to join the army.The Prime Minister said that he would be inclined to be guidedvery much by what the Chief Commissioner of Police thought, and he agreed that there should .be some enquiry into a mans past record.On the whole, if it were thought that the strike had definitelybroken down he would allow the men to join.The War Cabinet decided To refer the matter for decision to the Secretary of Statefor War and the Secretary of State for Home Affairs.Draft Bill to 2. With reference to War Cabinet 607, Minute 3, the WarCheck jProfiteering.   Cabinet had before them a draft of a Bill to check profiteering.The Prime Minister said he suggested that, as a Committeewas sitting to enquire into the question of profiteering, it would be advisable to limit the operations of the Bill under discussion to aperiod of six months, and treat it as a purely provisional measureuntil the Committee could suggest a more permanent remedy.. Some discussion then followed as to whether it would bepossible to pass the Bill before the end of the Session, and the FirstLord of the Admiralty said that he doubted very much if theGovernment could do this, inasmuch as the matter contained in theBill was very contentious and there would be a good deal of opposition. Although he thought that something was required to check profiteering, he feared that, unless an agreement was arrivedat with the House of Commons, the Bill did not stand a chance of getting through until the middle of September.It was pointed out,, on &apos; the other hand, that Members ofParliament would not be in a pleasant position, vis-a-vis theirconstituents, if they kept moving amendments to restrict the powerof tribunals to deal with profiteering.The Secretary of State for War said that the present Bill wasa reversion to devices only used in the mediaeval times, and itstigmatised with the brand of criminality actions which, up to now,had been considered lawful. It was probable that the Bill would provoke the Labour Party to ask what the Government was goingto do with regard to the profiteers who had already made hugeprofits. He thought the Government should not lose hope of pricesbreaking themselves, and the return of normal conditions, withoutassistance such as that proposed. He would, however, give trading-powers to Local Authorities which would enable them to break thering of price&apos; movement.The Food Controller strongly criticised the proposal to dealwith undefined profiteering through a system of Local Tribunals.He considered that Tribunals as proposed were not suitable bodies todeal with such a complex and difficult matter, and felt such a system*   would prove unworkable.Mr. Bonar Law pointed out that the Government was already committed to take action, inasmuch as the Bill had been introduced into Parliament that day.The Minister of Health said that he would like to give power-to Local Authorities, if they found that unreasonable prices werebeing charged, to deal themselves in commodities.The DischargedPolice and theArmy.
The President of the Board of Trade said that it was impossibleto fix a limitation of prices which would operate fairly in every partof the country. For instance, no prices would be fixed for bootswithout great profits being made in some places and practically noprofit at all in others.The First Lord of the Admiralty stated that a successfulexperiment had been tried in a certain large agricultural area wherethe farmers had agreed to sell cheese and butter only to thoseshopkeepers who undertook on their part to retail them for reasonable prices.The Secretary of State for War cited the case of two tradesmenpossibly in the same street and in the same line of business, one ofwhom would sell from his stock in hand and make perhaps 6 per cent.,and another who had recently been fortunate enough to buy upbankrupt stock at a normal price would make his 16 per cent. Insuch a case how would the tribunal act ?Mr. Bonar Law said it was only extreme cases which would justify a Bill and Government intervention.The First Commissioner of Works thought that the commonsense of the tribunals should find no difficulty in settling any cases that came before them.The President of the Board of Trade in reply to a cpiestion said,that he did not think it possible to insert in the Bill the phrase &quot; canfix a limitation of prices.&quot; He thought, however, that there shouldbe a clause to the effect that the Board of Trade could give power tothe Local Authorities to trade.The Minister of Health agreed as to the latter proposal and suggested that all question of interference by local tribunals shouldbe discarded from the Bill, and that the Cabinet should proceed onthe principle of granting Local Authorities power to trade. This, hethought would save many weeks of acrimonious discussion inParliament.The Minister of Labour pointed out that the Government weredefinitely committed to producing a Bill. If the House of Commonsrefused to accept the Bill, the onus of rejecting the Governmentsendeavours to protect the interests of the community would fall upon Parliament.Sir Eric Geddes suggested that the Bill should be considerablycompressed, and that for a period of six months only, in the firstinstance, authority should be given to the Board of Trade to grantpowers of investigation in the case of profiteering to local tribunals,and similarly powers of trade to Local Authorities. What was essential was to give the Bill the spirit of a purely emergencymeasure. Parliament should be told that the Government regardedprofiteering as such a very serious matter that they desired to have certain powers in case they found it necessary to use them.The Secretary of&quot; State for War agreed, as if the result was successful the Bill could be transformed into a permanent instrument.The President of the Board of Trade suggested that his department should be given general powers to make regulations.The Minister of Health proposed&apos; that the Board of trade should be granted power (a) to enquire into airy cases of complaintand ,report instances of profiteering to a Court of summary jurisdiction, and (6) to delegate this authority. In his view,reports, in the first instance, should be made to the LocalAuthorities, as the Board of Trade was far too busy to deal withthem.Sir Eric Geddes agreed1 that the Board of Trade should beauthorised to delegate its&apos; powers under the Bill to the CentralTribunal, to Courts of Summary Jurisdiction, and to LocalAuthorities : reports to be made, in the first instance, to the LocalAuthorities.The Secretary of State for War suggested that an additionalclause should be inserted authorising the Board of Trade to grant
the Local Authorities power to trade themselves, when the pricesbecame excessive, and to acquire shops temporarily for thispurpose.Sir Eric Geddes pointed out that this would only touch thesmall retailers and it would be quite impossible, for instance, for theLocal Authorities to start a Boot Manufactory for two or threemonths.The President of the Board of Trade read to the War Cabinetwhat he said was the main part of the Bill, viz., Clause 3 (i), (ii).The Bill enabled local retailers to complain against the wholesalemerchants where necessary, and local consumers could make similarcomplaints.The Secretary of State for War proposed that (i) should be redrafted, and something to the following effect inserted : &quot; In caseswhere public injury is caused by excessive prices . . . .&quot;The President of the Board of Trade suggested, &quot; because of thesocial evil created, it should be a punishable offence.....&quot;The Lord Chancellor said a vulnerable part of the Bill was thatit gave an opening for retailers to come forward and complain thatthe Government gave them no information as to what they regardedas a &quot; reasonable price.&quot;Sir Eric Geddes said that naturally the prices must vary indifferent localities.The Secretary of State for War suggested as an alternativereading: &quot;Where public injury has been caused by unreasonableprices in the case of articles of common use and prime necessity . . . .&quot;The Minister of Labour thought that perhaps too much hadbeen made of the difficulty Local Tribunals would have in deciding what was &quot; reasonable&quot; ; after all, juries had to determine this everyweek of the year.The Postmaster-General said that he did not share the viewthat the Bill would meet with a great deal of opposition inParliament. It presented an honest attempt to deal with profiteer-ing, and any Member of Parliament who obstructed it would not findfavour with his constituency.After a brief further discussion the War Cabinet decided (a.) That, subject to the Prime Ministers approval, the following committee of Ministers should be asked to re-draft theBill, with the aid of the Parliamentary Draughtsman,in the light of the above discussion, in time for the WarCabinet to consider it further the following day : The President of the Board of Trade,The Minister of Labour,The Secretary for Scotland ;(&amp;.) To adjourn the discussion until they were in possession ofthe new draft.2, Whitehall Gardens, SW.1,&apos; 1th August, 1919.o
