With reference to War Cabinet 591, Minute 7, the WarCabinet had before them the following documents regarding theuse of Government motor-cars: Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty (paper g.T.-7359),Note by the Acting Secretary, War Cabinet (Paper G.T.-7635),-     0^
Memorandum by the Minister of Munitions (Paper G.T.-7662),Memorandum by the Admiralty (Paper G.T.-7705).Mr. Bonar Law said that he had to answer a question in theHouse on this subject on the following day. When the matterlast came up for discussion he thought the War Cabinet were generally agreed that there should be a general pool under one department; that users of cars, other than,Ministers, should handin vouchers after every journey performed; that the expensivetype of car should be sold and a single inexpensive typesubstituted; and that the department responsible for maintaining the pool should be the Ministry of Munitions. There were two other points which he thought should be discussed: (1.) Whether a small committee, consisting of one or two persons, should be set up to decide which officials inthe various departments should have cars;(2.) Should Ministers be entitled to a car.The Prime Minister said that there was a good deal of feeling on the subject of Government cars, both in the House andin,the country. His opinion was that the Government should set an example, and that Ministers should not be allowed cars atthe country&apos;s expense. The expenditure of the country at present was enormous, and such an example would be a guarantee of the government&apos;s good faith in endeavouring to cut down expendi-ture. Since the conclusion of the war there had been an orgyof extravagance in every country, particularly in France, andeveryone seemed to have lost all idea of the value of money. Beforethe war, if a Minister had a car he maintained it at his own expense, and he thought that Ministers should revert to this practice. This would undoubtedly entail great inconvenience,but one could not expect other people to cut clown their expendi-ture unless the Government set a good example.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the coursesuggested by the Prime Minister would undoubtedly be a popularone, although it would hit Ministers very hard. As for himself,he did not think he could carry out his work and keep his appoint-ments without a car. Before the war, taxis were available, but now it was almost impossible to obtain one.The Secretary of State for War said that he had studied thisquestion, because there was the thinnest of differences betweenofficers at the War Office, who were not allowed cars, and officers at the Horse Guards and the Commands, who were allowed carsin order to get about their Commands. It was impossible to avoid a Commander-in-Chief of a Command having a, car, and at thesame time it was difficult to draw a distinction between them and members of the Army Council. At the present moment the WarOffice was responsible for providing cars for members of theGovernment. There was no doubt that the chauffeurs, especially the women, did not like driving Ministers, as they said it wasnot military work. The Quartermaster-General had worked out a scheme by which- Generals in Commands paid a certain sum tothe Government when they used their official cars for privatepurposes. He thought that a scheme of this kind might be worked out for application to Ministerial cars. The work ofMinisters had increased enormously since the war, and for himselfhe would find it&apos;difficult to carry out his duties without a car.The purchasing-power of money was one-third of what it was before the war, with the result that very few Ministers could afford to keep a private car. It was impossible, if a minister was allotted an official car, to draw a distinction between its use for private and official purposes, and he therefore thought that ministers should be given the opportunity of drawing upon aGovernment car, but that they should pay a certain sum when thecar was used for private purposes.
Mr. Barnes said that he was quite willing to fall in with thePrime Minister&apos;s suggestion and show an example, although therewas no doubt that it would entail great hardship on Ministers.For example, a few nights ago he did not leave the House ofCommons until after 11 p.m. ; he had dismissed his car, and notaxi was available; the trams were all full, and the result was thathe took an hour and a half to get home. But undoubtedly adecision to deprive Ministers of their cars would have a greatmoral effect, and he was prepared to support such a course.Sir Eric Geddes said that, in view of the hours which ministers now had to keep, it was impossible for them to do their work without a car; but he thought it was a mistake that high-power cars should be used, and that Ministers should be provided with, cars of a more modest horse-power.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he could not agreeto Mr. Bonar Law&apos;s suggestion that a small committee shouldbe appointed to decide which officials in the various departments should be allotted cars. It would be impossible for an outsiderto decide, with regard to the Admiralty, who should and who&apos;should not be entitled to a car. There were also difficulties inthe way of placing all cars in a pool under the Ministry ofMunitions. The Admiralty had a large motor-transport service,which included lorries as well as cars, and it would be impossibleto place this service, which was inseparable from the Admiralty,under the Ministry of Munitions. As far as he personally was concerned, it would be impossible for him to keep all his engage-ments without a car. Mr. Long added that he had now reduced the total number of cars used by the Admiralty to 15.Mr. bonar  Law suggested that a contract might be enteredinto with a firm, such as Messrs. Tillings, by which they provided the Government with cars when required.The Minister of Munitions said that such a scheme wasfeasible, and would be economical, inasmuch as it would cutdown the number of garages which the Government now had tokeep going.The Secretary cf State for War said that, if the Governmentwas to set an example, the whole system of official cars should beswept away. This was worth doing, but the Government would get no credit if only a half-hearted attempt were made. At thesame time, he thought it would be unfair to Ministers to deprivethem of cars, and would cause great embarrassment to those whowere not in possession of large private incomes.The Minister of Health agreed, that the Prime Minister&apos;suggestion was the only logical thing to do, but thought that, inview of the fact that the whole of a Ministers day was nowdevoted to Government service, such a course would be a greathardship.The Prime Minister said that the scandal regarding the useof cars was greatly exaggerated, but at the same time it wasweakening the influence of the Ministry. He would like a state-ment from each department, showing the number of cars they considered essential, and what they estimated would be the cost of running each car, including the driver. As for the question whichwas being addressed to the Leader of the House on the following day, he thought Mr. Bonar Law might inform Mr. Guinness thatthe Prime Minister was giving his personal attention to thesubject, and would, therefore, be glad if he would postpone his question.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) All departments should send immediately to the Secre-tary of the War Cabinet a statement oi the number ofoars which they considered essential for the purposeof carrying on the business of the departments, such statement to include an estimate of the total cost of running the cars:
(b.) The Leader of the House should request the Memberwho was putting a question on this subject on thefollowing day, to postpone it, as the Prime minister was giving his immediate attention to the matter.The Cenotaph in 2. With reference to War Cabinet 601, Minute 1, the WarWhitehall. Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandum by the first commissioner of Works (Paper G.T.-7704) on the question of retaining in a permanent form the Whitehall Cenotaph.The First Commissioner of Works stated that there was aconsiderable amount of public interest as to whether the presentCenotaph, which was of a temporary nature, should be retained in a permanent form. A certain amount had been written inthe newspapers, both in London and the provinces, on the subject,and generally public opinion was favourable to the idea of retain-ing the present form of the Cenotaph. It was constructed atpresent, however, only of plaster, and unless it were removedwithin the next nine or ten days it would probably crumble topieces. The great objection to the present site was that it would interfere with traffic; but he was informed by Scotland Yard thatthey did not regard that as serious.Mr. Barnes and the Secretary of State for War agreed that itwould be a great pity not to establish the Cenotaph in a permanentform.Mr. Bonar Law suggested that it might be wiser to leavethe decision for about a month. In his view, it was too soon after the Peace Procession to judge whether public opinion, whichwas now&apos; so strongly in favour of the Cenotaph, would continue tobe so.The First Commissioner of Works stated that, unless theCabinet came to an early decision, a great many other pointsmight arise, including the particular form of the Memorial that should be raised. If, on the removal of the temporary structure in the course of the next week or so, he was able to say that theGovernment had decided to reproduce the Memorial in somepermanent material, that would prevent a great fLeal of contro-versy.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that if there wereanything in favour of retaining the Cenotaph at all, and he believed that there was, he felt that it should be a reproductionof the actual monument which had been saluted on the occasion of the Peace Celebrations.The &apos; Prime Minister pointed out that the only serious objection to the proposal was that it would interfere with traffic,and they were assured that Scotland Yard did not consider this a grave objection. The only possible alternative to Whitehall asa site for the Memorial was the Horse Guards Parade, whichwould require something entirely different from, and much biggerthan, the present Memorial. No other Memorial would possess the value which this one had of having been saluted by all theAllied Forces on the 19th July.The War Cabinet decided &apos;(a.) To replace the present temporary Cenotaph onWhitehall by an exact replica in permanent materialon the same site:(,&amp;.;) The First Commissioner of Works should communicate with the Westminster Borough Council with a view.  to obtaining their consent to the proposal. C$Pensions for MenUnemployed.3. With reference to War Cabinet 600, Minute 2 (c) theChancellor cf the Exchequer said that the War Cabinet had decided that the pensions and allowances of partially disabled
men should be made up to the full pension given for total disable-ment in the case of men who were unemployed. He felt that theCabinet had not appreciated the full significance of that proposal.He assumed, in the first place, that the term &quot; during unemploy-inenfc&quot; only referred to the period during which the man was entitled to unemployment benefit. There was a great danger,however, that the grant might become permanent.The Minister of Labour pointed out that he had raised thispoint at the previous discussion of the War Cabinet. The proposi-tion was that a partially-disabled man, unemployed, instead of receiving unemployment allowance together with the pension towhich his disability entitled him, should be treated in exactly thesame way as a fully-disabled man. In making that propositionthere was a good logical foundation upon which to stand, as it did not appear fair that such a man should receive more money from the Government than the man who was totally disabled. Itwas almost certain, however, to give rise to a claim on the partof the man to be treated in this way whenever he was out ofemployment.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that a man whowas only slightly disabled would receive so much more help fromthe Government when he was out of employment than when hewas employed that there would be no encouragement for him totake work. For example, a man with three children if disabled20 per cent, would receive from the Government 70s. a week if he were unemployed, as against 14s. a week when employed. To his mind that was putting a premium on unemployment.The Prime Minister agreed that it would be ridiculous to payable man out of employment 70s. a week. The present system mightbe worse, but at all events the unemployment donation was atemporary measure, and would come to an end about November.The Minister of Labour said that he had realised this pointbefore, and that was why he had asked that he should be given time fcr considering the case of the unemployed man. He agreedthat the present system of granting unemployment allowancestogether with pension had grave defects, but it was a temporarysystem only, and could be improved upon by cutting out one of thetwo children&apos;s allowances to which an. unemployed disabled manwas now entitled.    He proposed to look into this matter.The War Cabinet decided To refer back to the Minister of Pensions and the Ministerof Labour the question of granting to disabled men outof employment the full pension for total disablementinstead of unemployment allowances and the pension towhich his degree of disability entitled him.4. With reference to War Cabinet 600, Minute 2, the WarCabinet had under consideration a Memorandum by the Ministerof Pensions (Paper G.T.-7835) containing further proposalsbased on the Report of the Select Committee of the House ofCommons on Pensions.The Minister of Pensions stated that there were some further points upon which he. wished a Cabinet decision. The SelectCommittee had made, no reference, in their first Report, to officers&apos;pensions, but he, thought that,, on, the analogy of the War cabinet decision in the case of men, it was only right that the existingwar bonus of 20 per cent, should be regarded as part of the pension, subject to triennial revision in relation to the cost ofliving, provided that the maximum reduction to be made shouldnot reduce the pension below present Warrant rates. In that way he thought that the Government would anticipate any recommendations the Select Committee were likely to make, andmight prevent a serious demand for increases in officers&apos; pensions.Eecommendationsof the SelectCommittee :on, 1&apos;ensions.Officers&apos; Pensions.
-Statutory Eight to pension.Eight of Appeal onAmount.Widows&apos;alternative pension.In any case, he thought that he was in a position to meet the attacks made on officers&apos; pensions in various quarters, sinceBritish officers&apos; pensions were higher than they were in any ofthe Colonies or Dominions or in any foreign country. The20 per cent, which he suggested should be made part of the pension was already payable, and all he proposed was that itshould be reviewed in three years&apos; time instead of at the end ofthis year, as at present arranged.The War Cabinet decided that The present war bonus of 20 per cent, on officers&apos; pensions should be treated as part of the pension, but should be&apos;subject to triennial revision in relation to the cost ofliving, on the same basis as men&apos;s pensions, provided that&quot;the maximum reduction to be made should not reduce the pension below present Warrant rates.The Minister of Pensions said that the Select Committee intheir Report had made a very strong recommendation in favourof giving disabled officers and men a statutory right to a pensionwithin the terms of any Order in Council or Regulation govern-ing the conditions of award. He had consulted the ParliamentaryDraughtsman, and he understood that there would&apos; be noadministrative difficulty in introducing into the War pensions bill, which he proposed to put before Parliament this Session, a clause to the effect that any officer or man was entitled to a pensionfrom the date upon which the Warrants came into force. Sucha clause would not necessitate setting up the administrative machinery by which the award was to be made. In effect itwould accomplish little, and he desired the authority of the WarCabinet to state that there was no objection to such a clause being introduced.The War Cabinet left the Minister of Pensions to deal withthe question in debate.The Minister of Pensions went on to say that the SelectCommittee were also pressing strongly to give pensioners the rightof appeal on the question of amount. It was not administrativelypossible to grant this right, and he proposed to fight any pressure on this matter. He was convinced that he was right in doing this, but he wished the War Cabinet to know that a real outcrymight be raised in the country on this issue.Mr. Barnes stated that he had been met with the samedemand when he was Minister of Pensions, and he had invariablyopposed it.The War Cabinet decided that No right of appeal should beamount.granted on the question ofThe Minister of Pensions further drew attention to thefollowing recommendations of the Select Committee, as to widows&apos;alternative pensions: (a.) The widow with children who at first goes on the flat rate should have the option to come on the alternative pension, if she desires it, as her children work off thePensions Scale. But she should apply to do so within alimited time, so that the necessary evidence may atonce be obtained and placed on record. Later on theevidence might not be available.(6.) The widow should be allowed Alternative Pension onthe basis of two-thirds of her husband&apos;s earnings,whether, in fact, he would have been himself entitledto the Alternative Pension or not. At present, it isnot so.
Land Acquisition 5. 1&apos;he War Cabinet had under consideration a note byBm- Mr. Evan Davies, in which it was stated that certain amendments to the Land Acquisition Bill had been accepted in the House ofCommons, which would have the effect of giving an official valueraccess to returns made for the purposes of Income Tax. TheLord Chancellor had tabled amendments, to be moved in Com-mittee of the House of Lords, to leave out the Commons amend-ments, the reason being that the Chancellor of the Exchequer had given a definite pledge that all returns made under the finance act would be treated as confidential.The Prime Minister stated that he had given a definite pledgein the House of Commons that, in the event of compulsory acquisi-tion, local authorities would be entitled to all relevant particulars,including those given under the Finance Act. The question a tissue was whether personal pledges given by a Minister ought &quot;tobe departed from. His own view was that the House of Commonscould abrogate an Act of Parliament, but that a Minister couldnot be a party to the abrogation of a pledge which he himself had given. Mr. Lloyd George then referred to a debate on the finance bill in the House of Commons on the 30th September, 1909, when an amendment was moved by Sir Edward Carson, the acceptanceof which by himself (the then Chancellor of the Exchequer) wouldhave, been in effect to give a pledge that municipalities and localauthorities should not, in assessing land acquired for public purposes, use information given to the Commissioners of InlandRevenue. &apos; He had strenuously opposed Sir Edward Carson&apos;amendment, and had definitely stated to the House his view that local authorities would have every right to obtain from the Com-missioners of Inland Revenue a certificate of the value upon whichthe owner of the land had chosen to pay taxation. The House ofCommons had supported him, and the amendment had been nega-tived by 186 votes to 59. The amendment which the LordChancellor now proposed was based on the assumption that a pledge had been given that returns made to the Commissioners of inland Revenue would be treated as confidential, whereas he, as. Chancellor of the Exchequer, had given a pledge exactly to the opposite effect.   When the Acquisition of Land Bill was beforeSir L. Worthiiigton-Evans stated that he felt the War cabinet should accept the recommendations of the Select Committee. he proposed that the application referred to in (a) should be made within one year from a date to be specified hereafter. There wasvery little money concerned in the question.The War Cabinet decided To accept the above recommendations of the Select Committee,subject to the concurrence of the Chancellor of theExchequer.Future Eevision of The Minister of Pensions stated that there was one furtheiPensions. point which required a decision.   He had understood that theWar Cabinet on the 26th July, in approving the new rates ofpension proposed by the Select Committee, had agreed that20 per cent, only of the pension would be subject to triennialrevision. The War Cabinet Minutes, however, showed that thewhole of the pension would be subject to revision. He felt thatsome part of the pension should be made permanent.The War Cabinet decided that Twenty per cent, of the new rates of pension approved formen and men&apos;s widows should be subject to revisiontriennially in relation to the cost of living, on a basisto be decided upon by the Minister of Pensions, thePresident of the Board of Trade, and the Minister ofLabour in consultation with the Treasury.
the House of Commons, the latter were very exercised as regardsthe basis of valuation, which they thought was too favourable tolandowners. The Attorney-General had consulted him on thequestion, and it was in view of the attitude taken by the Houseof Commons that the amendments now under consideration hadbeen accepted, which stated that, in valuing the land for purposesof acquisition, regard should be had to the valuation which hadbeen made for purposes of taxation. These amendments had passed the House of Commons without a division, and it was nowproposed that the Government should throw them out in the Houseof Lords.The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that he realised thePrime&apos;Minister&apos;s position. There was no doubt, however, that ifinformation collected for income tax purposes was used forgeneral purposes, the work of the Inland Revenue commissioners in obtaining correct returns would be rendered exceedingly diffi-cult. He himself, in reply to questions as to whether such information would be treated as secret, had replied that his pre-predecessors had always treated it confidentially. He further drew attention to the following question and answer on this subject inthe House of Commons on the 19th March, &quot;1912: &quot;Mr. Casset asked the Chancellor of the Exchequerwhether the Government departments would be furnished with particulars of valuations recorded under Section 30 ofthe Finance (1909-10) Act, 1910, or whether such particularswould only be furnished to persons interested in the land or persons authorised by them ?&quot; The Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. LloydGeorge): Particulars of the Government valuations underPart I of the Finance (1909-10) Act will only be furnished to persons interested in the land or persons authorised bythem, but the Government Valuation Department will give assistance to other departments of the Government requiringat any time to know the then value of any particular lands.&quot;Mr. Chamberlain said that he was quite sure, however, after hearing the Prime Ministers statement, that the House ofCommons, on the occasion of the Debate on the Finance Bill, 1909,to which Mr. Lloyd George referred, had understood that theinformation would be available for local authorities in cases of compulsory acquisition of land.The War Cabinet decided To request the Chancellor of the Exchequer to communicate with the Lord Chancellor with a view to the withdrawalof the amendments which the latter had tanled to theAcquisition of Land Bill.Night-baking., 6. With reference to War Cabinet 600, Minute 1 The War Cabinet took note that the  Food Controller con-curred in the decisions of the Cabinet  with regard tonight-baking and the Twelve-Hour Clause of the Bread, Order.Proposed Provision 7. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumof Armoured Cars.    Dy the Secretary of State for War (Paper. G.T.-7802), statingthat the War Office desired to proceed at once with the armouringof 100 chassis, already in stock, pending the consideration of acomplete programme.   The cost of these 100 armoured cars was&apos; &apos;   1      estimated at 50,OOOZ.   The heed&apos;for armoured cars at the present
time was urgent. The strength of the British forces all over theworld was being rapidly reduced; the duties which the remainingunits would be called upon to perform would be largely of a policenature over wide and unsettled areas. In these conditions, mobilecars, fitted with machine-guns, would be of the highest military value. At present the total number of cars in the possession ofthe British Army was: 22 in Egypt, 55 in Mesopotamia, 42 inIreland, and 50 in Great Britain, making 169 in all.The Secretary of State for War said that these 100 vehicles were required for the general purposes of the Army. It was essential to economise man-power, as far as possible, and thesecars presented an admirable substitute. When the time came toorganise the Imperial forces on a new basis there would not bethe usual proportion of the three arms, viz., cavalry, artillery, and infantry, but tanks, aeroplanes, and other mechanical substituteswould largely take their place. The Government had decided onlargely increasing the pay of the Army. This meant that the personnel would have to be reduced. The higher pay, however,would enable that personnel to be more highly trained and morescientific.The Chancellor of the Exchequer expressed surprise that atthe close of a great war we should require more armoured cars.The present request was for the armouring of 100 cars only, buthe understood that the Secretary of State&apos;s Memorandum was merely the foreword for a larger proposal for 3,000 cars. Hequite agreed with what Mr. Churchill had said, that mechanicaldevices should be introduced as far as possible, in order to supplantmen; but, as Mr. Churchill had stated in his Memorandum, thesum now asked for was not available on the original Estimates ofthis year. He understood from Mr. Churchill&apos;s finance depart-ment that the War Office would have spent the whole of this year&apos;estimates by the 1st October a revelation which disclosed a mostdisquieting situation.The Secretary of State for War asked that he might begranted some latitude in matters of - this kind, which he did notthink really necessitated reference to the War Cabinet. In his view, only larger matters of policy should be so referred. He him-self did not endorse the view of his financial advisers at the WarOffice, that the whole of this year&apos;s Estimates would be expendedin the course of the next two months. He wras confident, on thecontrary, that he would be able to effect very considerable savings in many directions. He was, however, handicapped in manyways. Men still had to be retained to guard German prisoners inFrance; men were required to guard and handle the great quan-tities of warlike stores which had been accumulated in France,and which could not readily be disposed of. He was, however,doing his utmost to liberate men as extensively and rapidly aspossible. He pointed out that hitherto our commitments hadgoverned our expenditure, but we were now approaching a period when expenditure would be governed by policy.The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought that it was hardlycredible that, in the course of the next two months, the Secretaryof State for War could so reduce his expenditure as to make a supplementary Estimate unnecessary. If, however, Mr. Churchillwould give his assurance to the War Cabinet that he would examine the whole question of military expenditure very closely,and effect in the near future very considerable economies, he was prepared to withdraw his objections to th6 present proposal.The Prime Minister thought it desirable that the Secretaryof. State for War should go most carefully into the whole questionof Army expenditure, and then discuss it with the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer. In his opinion, it was necessary that the Govern-ment should make a statement before Parliament rose, to the effectthat they had gone most carefully into the existing conditions andwere prepared to guarantee a very great reduction on the part ofthe spending departments at no distant date.
Strikes.Announcement bythe RailwayExecutiveCommittee.8. The President of the Board of Trade said that theRailway Executive Committee had recently made an announce-jment to the effect that it would be necessary for the guaranteedweek to be suspended in the case of those men for whom work could not be found in consequence of the falling off of traffic dueto the miners&apos; strike, and they had accordingly circularised therailway companies to give the usual notice of termination ofservice to such of their men as they would not be able to find fullwork for in consequence of the falling off of traffic, due to thepresent miners&apos; strike. This action, Sir Auckland Geddes said,had been taken by the Railway Executive Committee entirely ontheir own responsibility, and without reference to himself. He;had at once directed the Committee to suspend the above instruc-tion until the matter had been considered in all its bearings.The War Cabinet took note of the President of the Board ofTrade&apos;s statement.The Coal Strike. 9. With reference to War Cabinet 601, Minute 3, and inreply to a question by the Prime Minister, the Minister of Laboursaid that he had very little to report in regard to the coal strike.Pie had been in telephonic communication with Yorkshire, andgathered that the general impression there was that the miners were not disposed to give in. The Permanent Secretary to his- Ministry had proceeded to Yorkshire at an early hour that morning, with instructions to the effect that the government intended to stand by their recent offer, and were not prepared tomake any further concessions.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.&apos;l,July 30, 1919.oThe Secretary of State for War, in reply to the point madefey the Chancellor of the Exchequer, reaffirmed his view that theArmy Annual Estimates would not be exhausted by October next.He fully expected to achieve great economies before very long, andhe gladly undertook to go closely into the whole question and tosubmit proposals to the War Cabinet for, reducing expenditurebefore the end of the Session.The War Cabinet took note of the Secretary of State forWar&apos;s statement, and on this assurance decided to sanc-tion the provision of 100 armoured cars.
