Pensions Proposals. 2. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandum bythe Minister of Pensions (Paper G.T.-7777) (Appendix), in which he stated that the Select Committee of the House of Commons, tinderSir Montague Barlow, wdiichhad been set up to consider the pensions of disabled men, and of the widows and dependants of those killed in the war, was about to make an Interim Report in which, so hewas informed, they would recommend certain increases in flat ratepensions for men disabled, and for widows of men killed. Theywere, further, going to recommend that, in the case of a man or aman&apos;s widow claiming alternative pension, 60 per cent, should be- added to the actual pre-war earnings, in order to provide a basis of assessment; the pension to be subject to a maximum of 51. in thecase of a man, and of 31. 6s. Sd. in the case of a widow. The Ministerof Pensions proposed (1.) That the Government should adopt the Report of the SelectCommittee if it did not go further than the outline hehad given, with a proviso that after five years the rates would be reconsidered, and moved up or down as mightbe necessary, in accordance with any valuation whichmight take place in the cost of living. )(2.) That the Government should announce their intention of introducing a Bill to set up Appeal Tribunals, indepen-dent of the Ministry cf Pensions, whose decisions as toentitlement (not amounts) should be treated as final.Night-Baking. 1. With reference to War Cabinet 554, Minute 1, the WarCabinet had under consideration a Joint Memorandum by the HomeSecretary and the Minister of Labour (Paper G.T.-7786), in whichit was stated that the Committee which had been appointed to **ienquire into night-work in the baking trade had, after a careful review of the conditions in the different parts of the country,unanimously recommended that night-work between 11 p.m. and5 a.m. should be abolished, subject to certain exceptions ; but that,in view of the difficulty of obtaining new plant, and carrying outthe reorganisation which would be necessary in many bakeries, thestatutory pi-ohibition of night-work should not take effect untiltwo years after the passing of legislation. It was felt, however,that night-work should, wherever possible, be discontinued from now onward by mutual agreements between the representative organisations in the trade.The Memorandum further stated that the Food Controller was pressing for the revocation of the Twelve-Hour Clause of the BreadOrder, on the grounds that it was no longer necessary in the publicinterest and was being largely disregarded, and the Committee saw no reason for its continuance. It had been kept in force in order not to precipitate a crisis with the men by the resumption of night-baking, pending the. issue of the Cornmittee&apos;s Report. A meetingof the Joint Industrial Council had been summoned for the 26th or28th instant, in order to discuss the situation created by the Com-mittee&apos;s proposal, and it was felt that it would be a mistake to revoke the Twelve-hour Clause until after that meeting. authority was therefore asked for an announcement to be made (1.) That legislation will be prepared immediately to giveeffect to the Committee&apos;s recommendation for the abolition -tion of night-work as from 31st December, 1921.(2.) That the Twelve-hour Clause in the Bread Order will be revoked as from 1st, August.The War Cabinet decided To approve the proposals of the Home Secretary and theMinister of Labour, subject to the concurrence of the FoodController.
(3.) That, as regards partially-disabled men, their pensions and allowances should be made np to the full rate by theMinistry of Pensions during treatment, and by theMinistry of Labour during unemployment or training.The Minister of Pensions, replying to a question by the PrimeMinister, stated that the alternative pension had been introduced inorder to give to a man who was earning big wages before the war,a higher pension than the flat rate which was given to a manearning average wages. It was subject to a maximum of 31. 15s. aweek, plus the temporary bonus of 20 per cent. The Committeenow recommended that, in view of the decrease in the value ofmoney, 60 per cent, should be added to a man&apos;s pre-war earnings in assessing the amount of the alternative pension.Mr. Bonar Law enquired whether it was necessary to havealternative pensions at all.The Minister of Pensions pointed out that, to the extent the flat rate pension was raised, the alternative pension would bereduced. If, however, 40s. was going to be the maximum flat ratepension, it would be necessary still to continue the alternative pension.The Chancellor of the Exchequer drew attention to the presentand proposed rates for widows&apos; pensions. Under the present rates,a woman under 45 obtained 16s. rid a week, with the addition of8s. a week if she had one child ; a woman over 45 obtained 18s. aweek, and the same allowance for a child. Under the proposedrates, a woman under 40 would -obtain 20s. a week, and a womanover 40, 26s. civilian a week ; with one child, a woman, whatever herage, would obtain 36s. Sd. a week. Phis amounted to giving more for the child of a woman under 40 than for the child of a womanover 40.The Minister of Pensions pointed out that the rate of pension for a woman under 40, put forward by the Committee, was proposedonly in the case of the childless widow, and it was intended, tosome extent, to penalise the hurried war-marriage. The proposal ineffect was that a woman with a child should obtain the samewidow&apos;s pension, whatever her age.Mr. Bonar Law added that it was more than that ; it was feltthat if a woman had no child she ought to be encouraged to obtainwork ;. whereas a woman with a child had to keep, a home going.The -Minister of Pensions said that he had now heard fromSir Montague Barlow that the Select Committee, in their InterimReport, would not refer to dependants&apos;, pensions. It was not necessary, therefore, that the Cabinet should make an immediate announcement on this point, but he had thought it right to give anestimate in his memorandum of the additional cost if dependants&apos;pensions were increased on the same scale as men&apos;s and- widows&apos;pensions.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that there was one main point which he wished to raise. The proposal was persistently putforward for a statutory right to pension. The Minister of Pensionsthought that it would be very difficult to do this at present, but he proposed to set up by Statute Appeal Tribunals which would givea final decision as to whether a man was entitled to pension. He(Mr. Chamberlain) was of the opinion that now was the time for pensions themselves to be made statutory. Then it would be notpossible to change them without the introduction of a new Statute.The Minister of Pensions pointed out that it would be verydifficult to give a man a statutory right to a pension as long aspensions were temporary, as 90 per cent, of them were at present.If it were done a man would always be able to appeal to the Courtsagainst any particular pension which he had been awarded by a medical Board, and this would give rise to great administrative difficulties.
The Prime Minister thought that the principle of giving a mana statutory right to pension was a good one, hut it was too early todo so at present : we were too near the end of the war.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he did not see why, since they were going to set up Appeal Tribunals by Statute, the rates ofpension could not be made statutory by the same Bill. The Ministerof Pensions would still have discretion to fix the rates in individual cases.The Financial Secretary to the Admiralty said he agreed that aman should have a statutory right to a pension, but to give him aright to a pension of a particular amount was an entirely differentaffair, and should be considered separately.Mr. Bonar Law pointed out that a further objection to the chancellors proposal was that a Bill for the purpose would besubject to .endless discussion in the House of Commons, and would lead to considerable delay in setting up the Appeal Tribunals.The Minister of Pensions thought that he would be able to pass the Bill setting up the Appeal Tribunals through Parliament this session. He would not be able to do so if there were included in ita provision to make statutory a man&apos;s right to a pension.The Financial Secretary to the Admiralty pointed out that,under the Minister of Pension&apos;? proposal, the- Lord chancellor would make the appointments to, and the rules of procedure for,the Appeal Tribunals. This was open to the objection that people would say that the Minister of Pensions still had a hand in theseappointments, which he (Dr. Macnamara) would prefer should bemade by a Select Committee of the House of Commons. the tribunals would then be completely independent of the Minister ofPensions, and in some degree subject to the control of the House ofCommons.The Prime Minister pointed out that the constitutional methodof control by the House of Commons was through Ministers, and if that was departed from there was considerable danger that thewhole constitution of Government might be upset.The Minister of Pensions said that the Lord Chancellor wouldhave a perfect right to make all appointments to the appeal tribunals without consulting him. . *The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would like theCabinet to consider the proposals of the Minister of Pensions inrelation to the general financial condition of the country. He had circulated, a few days previously, a Paper-showing the Budgetposition for the current financial year. From this it appeared that,owing to increased expenditure and a decrease in estimated receipts,our deficit for the year would be nearer 40O,000,0O0L than the&apos; 250,000,0001. upon which he had reckoned. With the exception of,perhaps, 50,000,000L, the whole of the new money from the VictoryLoan would be swallowed up by this deficit, i.e., by the creationof new debt. The proposals now before the Cabinet would cost,for the current vear, about 12,000.00OL, and for a full year between20,000,0001. and 29,0OO,OO0Z.   He would point out, however, that.there Avas another Committee sitting on Old Age Pensions, and hehad been informed that, the proposals of this Committee wouldmean at the lowest an increased expenditure of 20,000,0001. Hewas going to circulate the following week a Paper on our general financial position, which he had been asked to prepare. He would only say, at the moment, that, even allowing for receipts on thebasis of a full year of the present taxation, it looked as though weshould be faced in 192.0-1 with a deficit of 200,000,0001. replying to the Secretary of State for War, who enquired what he had estimated for the Fighting Services, Mr. Chamberlain said that hehad estimated on an expenditure,&quot;&apos;&apos; in the case of the Army, of* N.B. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has since stated that the above figures were given in error. The correct figure is as follows: 350,000,0002. for the three services. The figures here given were the net estimates for each of the Services inthe current year.
.287.000,0001. ; in the case of the Navy, 150,000,0001.; and in thecase of the Air Force, 66.500,0001.The Secretary of State for War said that, in his view, the army would require nothing like 287,000,0001. for the following year.At the present time they had 1,200,000 on their ration strength, butthey were demobilising as fast as possible, and he hoped that bythe end of the calendar vear the numbers would he reduced byabout 600,000.The Prime Minister said that no House of Commons would look at Estimates such as those proposed by the Chancellor for theFighting Services.The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed that his figures werepurely hypothetical. He would point out, howrever, that theAdmiralty for the current year would require 20,000,0001. more thanthey had estimated for ; while the War Office would have spent the-whole of their Estimates for the year by October, and he could obtain no information as to future expenditure. He understood,also, that the Air Force Estimates would be exhausted by October.The Under-Secretary of State for Air said that, on the contrary,they hoped that their Estimates would be sufficient, with theexception of, perhaps, 6.000,000/,. extra, to carry them to the end ofthe financial year. This veiy rough estimate, however, depended upon whether the Ministry of Munitions were fortunate in regard tocertain contracts.The Chancellor of the Exchequer repeated that his figures werepurely hypothetical, but, in view of the fact that we had to make good probably 5O,OO0,000Z. on account of Excess Profits, in additionto the relief in respect of Income Tax, we should in any case have a very heavy deficit in the following financial year. Mr.Chamberlain added that the Government w7as being confronted withthe Report of one Committee after another, and that these reports were being judged separately. The Cabinet were unable to considerthe aggregate cost of the proposals made in all the Reports.The Secretary of State for War said he thought the WarCabinet should certainly discuss the general financial position, butthe financial year 1920-1 was entirely different from the presentyear, and should be considered separately. As for the future, he did not contemplate that our post-war army would be any greaterthan it was before the war ; nor did he anticipate that any element of compulsion would be necessary in its recruitment, in spite of thefact that our commitments had increased so considerably. His own opinion was that the Army would not require more than about one-third of the amount the Chancellor had suggested. With regard tothe Air Force, he thought that 25,000,U00L was as much as could beexpected for that Service. He expressed astonishment at the figureof 150,000,0001. suggested by the Chancellor for the Navy.The Financial Secretary to the Admiralty thought that, in viewof the expenditure to which the Admiralty were already committed,it would be very difficult to get beknv 15O,000,00OZ. in the financialyear 1920-1.The Prime Minister said that, in view of the statement of theSecretary of State for War, he was now more inclined to accept theMinister of Pensions&apos; proposals. He asked Mr. Chamberlain whether he wished to urge objection to the present proposals.The Chancellor of the Exchequer replied that his remarks weregeneral in character, and that this would be about the worst instanceon which to take a stand.The Financial Secretary to the Admiralty said that the Ministerof Pensions was proposing to revise the rates of pension in five yearstime. At the present time the maximum pension was 33s. a week,made up of 27s. Qd. with an addition of 20 per cent. War Bonus.He suggested that the rate should be kept at 27s. 6d. and the wholeof the increase now proposed be granted as a War Bonus.The Minister of Pensions said, he had considered that possibility[424] C
very carefully, but he could not advise the War Cabinet to acceptthe suggestion. If that were done, all the Government would getcredit tor was the 27s. 6cZ. flat rate, and there would be considerableagitation to have the whole of the peusion and bonus made permanent.The Prime Minister pointed out that the present rates were onlyjustifiable in view of the cost of living. Pensions such as those nowproposed would have been regarded as profligate before the war.In view of the possibility of a fall in the cost of living in the nearfuture, it was impossible to make these permanent rates.The Minister of Pensions said that the Select Committee were going to suggest in their Report that the rates should be reconsideredannually in relation to the cost of living. He thought, however,that a triennial revision would be sufficient.Mr. Bonar Law suggested that the proposal was rather indefiniteat present. He thought there should be a fixed scale, and that the pension should var3r on tnis scale with the-cost of living. Would it not be possible to make one-third or one-fourth of the pension&apos;opento revision as prices rose or fell ?The Minister of Pensions suggested that the same formulamight be used as in the case of the new scales of pay and retired pay for officers, namely, that 20 per cent, should be regarded as aprice bonus, to be varied up or down according as the cost of livingrose or fell.The Prime Minister suggested that the Minister of Labour, thePresident of the Board of Trade, and the Minister of pensions should, in consultation with the Treasury, draw up a formula for the variation of the rates of pension in relation to the cost of living.The Minister of Labour said that there was one point affectinghis Department which was referred to in the Minister of Pensions&apos;Memorandum. Up to the present, partially-disabled men were entitled to draw unemployment pay if unemployed, or trainingallowance if under training, in addition to their pensions andchildren&apos;s allowances. This did not appear right, but it was a principle generally accepted that a man&apos;s wages should not beaffected by his pension, and it would be difficult, in the present state of public opinion, to change this. The Minister of Pensions,however, now proposed that a partially disabled man, whenunemployed, under treatment or under training, and thus deprived of his earning capacity, should be treated as totally disabled ; thatis to say, he should be placed in a position as advantageous as, butnot more so than, a totally disabled man. He had no doubt therewould be a certain amount of irritation on account of this, but he felt it was a question on which the Government could take a stand.There were, however, other difficulties arising from the fact that,whereas unemployment pay had been at a flat rate, in the case ofpensions there were complications of rank and degree of disability.He was not certain that, at the moment, he had sufficient staff to cope with these difficulties. He would suggest, therefore, that the WarCabinet, whilst sanctioning the proposal of the Minister of Pensions,should decide that it should apply at first only to men in training orunder treatment, and that the question as regards unemployed men should be considered at a later date.The Minister of Pensions pointed out that, in that case a man who was unemployed would get a pension as well as unemployment donation. If the latter were to be abolished at all, now was the timeto do it, when the pensions were being increased.The Minister of Labour observed that if unemployed men were now granted the maximum pension, there would be a tendency forthis to become permanent, since any disabled man out of employ-ment in the future would claim that he was entitled to the fullpension. . It was a choice of two evils. The Cabinet could eithercontinue to grant unemployment donation, together with the increasedpension, or they could place these men on the maximum pensionwith the possibility of a claim at some future date that it should bemade permanent.
Help of British  . 3. The Secretary of State for War said that a request had beenTroops for German received for the help of British troops in gathering the harvest inHarvest. ^e occupied territories of Germany.    The Commander-in-Chiefsaw no objection to this, from a military point of view, but hewould like to have the views of the War Cabinet, upon the matter.The War Cabinet decided To sanction the proposal of the Secretary of State for War, onthe distinct understanding that any men so employedwoidd be volunteers.Publicity. 4. The Minister of Labour said that. it. was very essential thatsome arrangement should be made for more publicity in thenegotiations between the Government and the Labour world, andhe would be very glad if the Treasury would give him all theassistance they could.The Prime Minister stated that, in view of the possibility of unrest during the next few months, the Ministry of Labour shouldbe given all possible help in putting the true facts before the.  public.The War Cabinet decided (a.) That the Minister of Labour should put forward a schemefor the consideration of the Treasury ;(b.) To request the Treasury to give the scheme favourable consideration.PaJ f the Army 5. With reference to War Cabinet 594, Minute 4, the WarItorce Cabinet  had  under  consideration   the  Second  Interim Report(Paper  G.-254)  of the Committee on Naval, Military  and Air/-) Force pay, making certain recommendations in regard to the pay and pensions of the rank and file of the Army and Royal Air Force.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the committee recommended that the pay for a private soldier should be 4s. perdiem after two years service.   Everything turned upon this basicThe War Cabinet decided (a.) To approve the new rates of pension for men and menswidows, proposed by the Minister of Pensions in paper g.T.-7777 (Appendix), the rates to be revised trienniallyin relation to the cost of living, on a basis to be decided upon by the Minister of Pensions, the President of theBoard of Trade, and the Minister of Labour, in consulta-tion with the Treasury.(6.) To authorise the introduction of a Bill to set up appeal tribunals, independent of the Ministry of Pensions,whose decision as to entitlement (not amounts) shouldbe treated as final; the Lord Chancellor to have thepower of making the appointments to, and the Rules ofProcedure for, the Tribunals ;(c.) That the pensions and allowances of partially-disabled men should be made up to the full rate by the Ministry ofPensions during treatment, and by the Ministry ofLabour during unemployment or training ;(cl.) That, in estimating the alternative pensions of officers and officers&apos; widows, 60 per cent, should be, added to theofficers pre-war earnings ; and elsewhere when assess-ments are made of pre-war dependants or pre-warincome.(e.) That the new proposals should take effect from the1st September, 1919; or from the earliest date thereafterby which arrangements can be - made by the Ministerof Pensions and the Minister of Labour.
rate, as, if the War Cabinet decided to alter it, all the other rates would have to be adjusted accordingly. He had seen in a WarOffice Report on pay, a statement to the effect that, had theAdmiralty not recommended the increase of the pay of Naval ratingsto 4s. a day, the Army Council would have considered 3s. per diemsufficient for a fully trained private soldier. The War Office,however, contended that it was quite impossible to maintain asatisfactory and contented army if the rates of pay were materiallylower than those given to the Royal Navy and Marines. Beforethe war the sailor had been paid at a higher rate than the soldier,and this apparently had then given no cause for discontent.He suafeested that the War Cabinet should fix the basic rate atDO3s. 6cZ., and direct that the necessary adjustments should be madeaccordingly in the other rates.It was pointed out that the cases of the ordinary private soldierand the Koyal Marines were hardly analogous, as the latter was avery highly trained man, who had to specialise amongst other thingsin gunnery.The Secretary of State for War said that when he had originallyasked for permission to raise the rates of pay for men of the army of Occupation, he had never contemplated that the committee presided over by the Minister of Education would recommend suchhigh rates as were set forth in the Committee&apos;s report. In fixing the pay of the Army of Occupation the War Office had been careful not to stereotype the rates, but rather to proceed by way of bonuses.The whole case had unquestionably been prejudiced by the recom-mendations of the Jerram Committee. He urged that it would be unfair to put the soldier on a definitely lower basis than the sailor,and it would arouse strong public resentment. His own opinion was that unduly high rates were not in the permanent interest ofthe army.   The case of the navy was different.It was probable that we should be able to reduce our navy andits personnel, which would be very highly trained and consequentlywell paid. The maintenance of a not inconsiderable army would,however, always be necessary so long as we had to provide overseasgarrisons. He suggested that the basic rate of 4s. should beallowed to stand for the army, but not in perpetuity. A high rateof pay, however, in the case of the Air Force was vital, as otherwise it would be impossible to attract to it the right sort of men.The Prime Minister suggested that a higher basic rate mightbe fixed for long service men, that is to say for men who enlistedmore especially for service overseas. This rate, however, might bereduced in the case of men who entered the army for a short period only and who were for home service. The only justification for having the same rates for the army and navy would be thatthe conditions were substantially the same, but this was not thefact. Compared with that of the soldier on home service the life of a sailor was uncomfortable and confining and the conditionsonly became comparable when a soldier was sent abroad to placeslike India and Mesopotamia.He thought, therefore, that they should give the 4s. rate to thefully trained private only when he was quartered in such climates.The Secretary of State for War again urged that no stigma. should be placed on the soldier by giving him a lower rate than thesailor. He agreed with the Prime Ministers suggestion that 4s.should be given only to long service men on proceeding overseas,the home service man receiving sixpence less. In order to getsufficient numbers he thought that it would be necessary to alter the terms of service for home service men to two or three years withthe colours and nine or ten in the reserve.He suggested that he should draft some proposals on theselines and submit them to Mr. Fisher&apos;s Committee.The President of the Board of Education said that he welcomedMr. Churchill&apos;s suggestion.   He confessed that he had been very
7 ii iWC 600uneasy about the 4s. basic rate and his Committee would never have recommended it had not the Government accepted the recommenda-tions o  the Jerram report.   From the economic standpoint a 4-s.O base must necessarily limit the size of our army, and he agreed thatit was undesirable to have so small an Army as the adoption of this rate would imply. The experience of the last few years hadconvinced him that our Army had its use for social purposes, andhe regarded it as a magnificent school for the discontinuous worker.He suggested that Mr. Churchill&apos;s proposals should be referred inthe first instance to the Cabinet. If the Cabinet accepted them theymight be submitted to his Committee, who would make revisedrecommendations.Mr. Bonar Law asked that the Secretary of State for war should prepare figures showing the difference which a reduction ofthe basic rate for the home service Army would make, taking forpurposes of illustration the size of our pre-war Army. He himself was not prepared to accept the contention that the Jerram. report had prejudiced the case so far as the Army was concerned. he doubted whether the Army expected such high rates as Mr. Fisher&apos;sCommittee recommended. What the Army Council had to considerwas, what rate of pay was necessary in order to get &quot;the right meninto the Army.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, referring to the Secretary ofState&apos;s proposal that a lower basic rate should be fixed for short service men, suggested that a 4s.. rate for the long service soldiershould start when the latter passed the Navy term of non-continuousservice, e.g., after five years. So long as the Secretary of State forWar accepted the principle that the rank and file of the Air Forcestood on a different footing from that of the rank and file of theArmy, he would raise no objection to the new rates proposed forthe Air Force.The War Cabinet decided (a.) To adopt the recommendations of Mr Fisher&apos;s Committeein respect of new rates of pay and pensions for other ranks of the Royal Air Force.(b.) To reserve for further consideration the question of the pay of other ranks of the Army, pending the preparation and submission to the War Cabinet by the. Secretary ofState for War of proposals and estimates in the light ofthe above discussion.6. The President of the Board of Trade stated that a ratherdisquieting situation had arisen. Purchases of imports were ceasingowing to the spread of a rumour, for which there was no foundation,that after the 1st September stricter import restrictions would be imposed. The effect of this would naturally be to put prices up inthis country. He asked for the authority of the War Cabinet tomake an announcement that there was no truth in the rumour andthat there would be no general increase in the import restrictionsafter the 1st September.Mr. Bonar Law doubted whether this would be putting it in theright form. He would prefer that the President of the Board ofTrade should say that the Government hoped to be able to formulatea trade policy very shortly, and the present system would continue until the end of this year. He, himself, saw no prospect of being-able to state our trade policy before Parliament rose. What he wished to avoid was a premature controversy on our trade policy.The Prime Minister thought that a statement might be made that, at any rate, the recent restrictions would not be increased.He, himself, had stated the previous day that the prevailing labourunrest made it very difficult for the Government to formulate apermanent trade policy but that, given a measure of industrialDAnnouncement inParliamentregarding import restrictions.( )[424]
peace, the Government hoped to make a statement before the recess.That policy would have to be very carefully considered by theWar Cabinet before any announcement could be made.The Secretary of State for War expressed the view that rising prices provided the only remedy against present extravagance.After a brief discussion the War Cabinet decided To authorise the President of the Board of Trade to announce in Parliament, by means of question and answer, thatthere was no truth in the rumour that after the 1stSeptember there wotild be a general increase in import restrictions.2, Whitehall Gardens, 3.W.1,July 26, 1919.
APPENDIX.(G.T.-7777.) . -I CIRCULATE the following for consideration as an urgent matter.L. W. E.Ministry of Pensions, July 22; 1919.MEMORANDUM ON PENSIONS PROPOSALS.-Just before the last election the Government promised to set up a SelectCommittee to consider and report upon the grievances of disabled men and the widows and dependants of those killed in war.The Select Committee was set up in April last, and is now about to make an interim report.Immediate action on the report could probably not be avoided on account of the acute feeling existing as to the inadecpaacy of the present pensions and the endorse-ment recently given by Sir Douglas Haig to the demands for increase, but action is rendered more urgent because the Pensions Estimates have to be discussed in theHouse of Commons on Wednesday next, and cannot be postponed as the vote will thenbe exhausted.I therefore bring before the Cabinet the proposals which I understand the SelectCommittee are making with an estimate of cost, in advance of the actual report, so as togive time for consideration.1. Men&apos;s Pensions [at 100 per cent, disability, lesser disabilities in proportion).(a.) Flat Rate. 	Present Rate.	Proposed Rate.Single man Married, with wife but no children   ... ,,       ,,    1 child ,,        ,, - 2 children For each additional child under 16 years old.	33s. a week 33s.      ,, 41s. 47s. 5s.	40s. a week. 50s. 57s. 6d. ,, 63s. 6d. ,, 6s.       ,,(b.) Alternative Pensions.The Select Committee proposes to add 60 per cent, to the actual pre-war earnings of a man claiming alternative pension with a maximum of 51., and to grant him apension on that basis less the actual earnings of which he is now capable.It is expected that about 1&apos;2  per cent, of the men pensioned will be entitled toalternative pension.2. Widow&apos;s Pensions.(a.) Flat Rate.	Present Kate.	--	Proposed Rates.Without a child  Under 45 Over 45... With one child        ...

3. Dependants Pensions.It is not known what the Committee will propose, but on the basis employed for increasing the rnens and widows&apos; pensions 40 per cent, would be added to existinggrants at an extra cost of 3,000,000Z. a-year.Estimated Cost of Proposals.Additional cost-   Men (inchiding wives and children)       -   .., ...   .12,500,000Widows (including children)        ... ... ...     5,400,000Other dependants       ..... ... ... ...     3,000,000Total    ... ... ... ...   20,900,000There will be an additional charge during the next year or so for temporarypensions.If these proposals are put into operation for six months of this year, 12,000,00uZ.should be added to the estimates of the year.Observations.Unemployed Pay, Treatment and Training Allowances.At present men disabled 90 per cent, and less are entitled to draw unemployedpay and children&apos;s allowances in addition to their pensions and children&apos;s allowances.Thus, a man 90 per cent, disabled if out of work, may draw in pension and unemployedpay 87s. del. a week.A saving would be effected in some cases if a partially disabled man whenunemployed, under treatment, or under training, and thus deprived of his earning capacity were treated as totally disabled.If the proposed rates are adopted, a 90 per cent, disabled man would then draw onthe new rates 69s. 6d. instead of 87s. 6d., a 50 per cent, disabled man would draw69s. 6d. instead of 67s.&quot; Statutory Right to Pensions.&quot;Independent Appeal Tribunals.One of the claims most persistently put forward by the Association of DischargedMen is the claim to a pension by Statute and not by Warrant or Order in Council.There are many administrative difficulties in the way of giving a full statutoryright with power to enforce the pension claim in the Law Courts.To meet the claim in part Appeal Tribunals have been set up, and if a claim for pension is refused on the ground of non-entitlement, the case goes before an appeal tribunal.Mr. Bonar Law promised the House of Commons that such a decision should be final. Constitutionally the Minister is responsible and cannot delegate a final decision ;moreover, it is urged by the Disabled Men&apos;s Associations that, as the Minister appointsthe Tribunals, they are not independent.I propose that the Tribunals should be set up by Act of Parliament, and that theLord Chancellor should make the appointments and have power to make rules ofprocedure.I believe this will meet the present pressure, .and if later the administrative difficulties can be removed, a further extension of the right of appeal might begranted.Officers&apos; and Officers&apos; Widows&apos; Pensions.It is understood that no recommendation is to be made by the Committee in theirinterim report for any increase in officers&apos; and their widows&apos; pensions, but it must be pointed out that if 60 per cent, is to be added, as I think it should be, to the pre-warearnings of men to compensate for the fall in the value of money, the same coursemust be followed for the alternative pensions of officers and their widows, and also in assessing dependency and elsewhere when pre-war income is taken into account.Subject to this, which is relatively a minor matter, I do not expect that there willbe any demand for an increase in officers&apos;, &amp;c., pensions. 1
Submission.1. In the circumstances, I think the Government cannot refuse to adopt the SelectCommittee&apos;s report if it does not go further than the outline I have given. I therefore ask for authority to announce its acceptance (with the consequential alterations I have noted), with a proviso that after five years the rates will be reconsidered and movedup or down as may be necessary in accordance with any variation which may takeplace in the cost of living.2. I also ask authority to say that it is the intention of the Government tointroduce a Bill to set up the Appeal Tribunals independent of the Ministry of Pensionsand that their decision as to entitlement (not amounts) shall be treated as final.3. I also ask authority to state that, as regards partially disabled men, their pensions and allowances shall be made up to the full rate by the Ministry of Pensionsduring treatment and by the Ministry of Labour during unemployment or training.L. W. E.Ministry of Pensions,July 22, 1919.
