Draft Bill to 1. WITH reference to War Cabinet 608, Minute 2, the WarCheck Profiteering.   Cabinet had under consideration the revised draft of a Bill to checkprofiteering.The Secretary of State for War enquired what was the objectof Clause 1, sub-section 2 (c), under which the Board of Trade might require a person who complained of the price at which an article wasbeing sold, to purchase the article at a price which the Board ofTrade considered would yield a reasonable profit.The President of the Board of Trade replied that this had beenput in in order to prevent people from making frivolous complaintsout of spite. &apos;The Prime Minister expressed doubt as to the advisability of keeping the clause in the Bill as it was introduced. It might beintroduced as an amendment if the House of Commons so desired.There was one general question which he would like to be considered,namely, who was to be responsible for articles of food under the Bill.It appeared to him that it would be better to leave to the Ministryof Pood the investigation of prices, costs, and profit in respect ofthese articles.The President of the Board of Trade explained that arrange-ments had been made with the Ministry of Food whereby the Boardof Trade would delegate such responsibility in the case of articles offood, actually controlled by the Ministry of Food, to that Department.The Food Controller enquired whether there was any objectionto having this made clear in the Bill.The Prime Minister thought that the Bill could specifically statethat the responsibility for investigation and prosecution in respectto articles of food should rest with the Food Controller. It was not sufficient that the powers now conferred on the Board of trade should be exercised by that Department through the Ministry ofFood. The latter Department had the necessary machinery forcarrying out investigations as regards food, apd should thereforeitself exercise the powers which the Bill gave. Would it not bepossible to introduce into the Bill words to the effect that the boardof Trade should, when necessary, act in consultation with theMinistry of Food ?The President of the Board of Trade said that he was quiteagreeable that the powers conferred by the Bill should&apos;be givenjointly to the Board of Trade and the Ministry of Food, and that heshould consult the Minister of Food as regards the division ofresponsibility between the two Departments.Mr. Bonar Law suggested that a clause should be introduced into the Bill to the effect that responsibility for all articles of foodcontrolled by the Ministry of Food should continue to vest in that department, and that other articles of food should be the subject of joint arrangement between the Board of Trade and the Ministryof Food.After further general discussion as to the allocation ofresponsibility for action between the Board of Trade and theMinistry of Food, it was decided To amend the first line of Section 1 to read as follows : &quot; The Board of Trade and Ministry of Food, jointlyand severally, shall have power,&quot; &amp;c.It was further agreed, on the suggestion of the Secretary ofState for War  -       &apos;To delete the words &quot; of commerce &quot; at the end of the secondline of Section I, and to substitute the following- words,which had appeared in the first draft: &quot;being an article or class of article declared by the.;   Order to be one or one of a kind in common use by themajority of the population.&quot;
In accordance with these decisions, Section I will commenceas follows: &quot; The Board of Trade and the Ministry of Food, jointly andseverally, shall have power in respect of any article being anarticle or class of article declared by the Order to be one or one of a kind in common use by the majority of thepopulation . . . . &quot;The War Cabinet also agreed :(a) To accept in principle the following suggestion of Mr. BonarLaM :-&quot;As regards food, in the case of those articles which are controlled by the Ministry of Food this Bill will notapply; and in regard to other articles of food, the powers under this Bill will be exercised by the Board of Tradein agreement with the Ministry of Food.&quot;(6.) To amend Clause 3 to read somewhat as follows : &quot; The Board of Trade may, if they think fit, authorise LocalAuthorities, subject to such conditions as the Board mayimpose, to purchase and sell any articles of commerceincluded in the Board of Trade declaration, and that any local Authority so authorised shall have all necessary powers for the purpose.&quot;Subject to the above decisions in principle, the War cabinet approved the Draft Bill.2, Whitehall Gardens, 8.W.1,August 8, 1919.
