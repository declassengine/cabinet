Police Strike. 1. The Prime Minister called attention to a strike in thePolice Force which had taken place on the previous nighty and tothe arrangements which had been made by the Chief commissioner to deal with it,   A Police Order would be published before midday,        ^)dismissing the whole of the men who had withdrawn themselves from duty.   (Appendix)The Eailway 2. With reference to War Cabinet 604, Minute 1, the PrimeSituation. Minister said that, at the meeting held on the previous evening, ithad been reported that there was more trouble in the railway world.He had that morning seen Mr. J. H. Thomas, who had informed him that he did not think the demand for which Mr. Hudson was pressing would entail any further expenditure on the part of theEailway Executive.The President of the Board of Trade doubted if this was quitecorrect, and explained his reasons for so thinking.The Situation in 3. With reference to War Cabinet 603, Minute 2, the WarEussia. Cabinet had under consideration a point raised by Mr. Barnes inconnection with the Minutes of the meeting of the War cabinet held on the 29th July, 1919 (War Cabinet 601, Minute 4).Mr. Barnes said that, while not wishing to question the accuracy of the Minutes, he would like to raise a point as regardsthe wording of Conclusion (j) of the summary of the proceedings.He took exception to the wording of this Conclusion in so far as itsaid that assistance to General Denekin should be continued onthe same lines as hitherto. Up to date, General Denekin had beengiven men, munitions, and food, and he (Mr. Barnes) thought very strongly that General Denekin should be given no more&apos;men, for ifcasualties occurred a difficult situation would be created. Also, asregards munitions, he had been under the impression that everyonewas agreed that a time limit should be put on the despatch ofmunitions. Further, as to food, if we were going to help in theway of food, he thought that our Allies ouglit also to be asked what they were prepared to do. He noticed that morning a dis-quieting telegram had been received from the General Officer Com-manding at Archangel, which raised the question of men and storesbeing left there. The time had come, in his opinion, for sayingdefinitely what we were prepared to do.The Secretary of State for War explained that, up to date, no men had been sent to General Denekin except what was called aBritish Mission. This was not to exceed the number of 2,000, andthey were not supposed to be fighting men, although, of course, if in the front line they might have to take part in the fighting.These men were really there in order to supervise the transport anddistribution of the stores which we were giving to General Denekin,and at the same time to explain to the Russians the working of tanks and machine guns. There were also a certain number ofaviators, who were teaching the Russians to fly. He would liketo point out that, up to date, so far from exceeding the limit placedon theWar Office, the numbers sent out had been considerably less,and at the present time the total number of British troops withGeneral Denekin was something between 800 and 900. It mightbe necessary to send a few more, under the terms of the conclusion referred to, but they would only be sent in batches of 20 or 30 at atime. As regards munitions, practically the only stores which had &apos; &amp;been sent to General Denekin up to date were surplus to our own requirements. He proposed to prepare a statement, however, toshow what stores had been sent which did not come under this category. He was also going to ask the Cabinet to give someeconomic assistance.   He felt very strongly in the matter, and did
3WG 605not think it was right to give way to the clamour of those people who were trying to paralyse our efforts in helping the Russians.As regards North Russia, the policy of evacuation had been agreedupon, and the strictest orders had been issued to see that nothing was done except with that object in view.The Prime Minister explained that the question now raisedwas with reference to assistance to General Denekin, and concerneda decision as to whether we should say that we would not send anymore men, and that some time limit should be placed on the period for which we were prepared to assist him with munitions. was it right to encourage General Denekin to believe that we would go on helping him with munitions for an indefinite time that is,if his operations lasted for another year or two ? It was very important that this should be considered. As regards food, itmust be remembered that any food sent to General Denekin wouldhave to be taken away from the people of this country.The Secretary of State for War suggested that we should con-tinue to help General Denekin for another six months, on the same lines as we had done in the past. He would like&apos; the Treasury,however, to give the War Office a fixed sum to spend during thattime, on the completion of which the whole question should again be reviewed.Sir Eric Geddes explained that it was with the object of&apos; getting some idea as to what the War Office wanted to do in thenext few months that Lord Curzon had asked for an estimate ofexpenditure in connection with Russian operations in the current financial year for inclusion in a paper which he was preparing.Sir Eric Geddes then read out from the Minutes of the meetingof the Cabinet on the 29th July the form in which Lord Curzonhad asked that the figures of expenditure might be given.The Prime Minister doubted whether the Cabinet was in aposition to discuss the question, raised by the Secretary of Statefor War, of giving the War Office a definite sum which they couldexpend, until the paper which was being prepared by Lord Curzonwas available. So long as it was clearly understood that no definite decision had been arrived at there appeared to be no reason for notauthorising the Secretary of State for War to continue to assistGeneral Denekin in the meantime on the same lines as in the past.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff understood that theconclusion arrived at at the last meeting of the Cabinet when this question was discussed was that the War Office could continueto assist General Denekin with any stores which were surplus toour own requirements: and, as regards personnel, might send anynumber up to 2,000 men, which they already had permission to do.At the present time there were only 700 to 800 men with general denekin, and it would in any case be some considerable time beforeanything like the number of 2,000 could be reached.The Prime Minister thought that, as few men as possible should be sent, as more trouble was likely to be caused in thiscountry by sending men to Russia than by the despatch of stores.Some discussion then ensued as to whether any trouble hadbeen experienced with the men already in South Russia.General Briggs explained that, they were all volunteers, andthat only a few airmen had really done any fighting. Most of themen were employed on technical work behind the line, and the tanks were actually worked in action by the Russians themselves.General Briggs further explained that the men who were sent outwith the tanks were merely conducting parties, and returned fromNoivorossisk as soon as they had handed over the tanks. Those whowere instructing the Russians in the use of tanks were at Ekateri-nodar. which was 400 miles behind the fighting line.The Prime Minister did not think it was possible to draw any distinction between assisting General Denekin with men andassisting the forces at Archangel in a similar way. He was coni-vinced, however, that the Bolshevik cause was strengthened by the
presence of foreigners on Russian soil. A similar situation had arisen in the operations against Bela Kun in Hungary. Exactly&apos;the same thing had occurred in the French Revolution.General Briggs, in reply to a question by the Secretary ofState for War, explained how the Russian Commanders had asked that English officers might be sent up to the line when no fighting was going on, in order to convince his troops and the people in the occupied territories that Great Britain was supporting their cause.In other words, they were merely used for propaganda purposes,to convince a poor, oppressed people that someone was helpingthem. The English officers were regarded by the Russians as toovaluable to fight, and were always sent away before fightingoccurred. He added, in reply to a question by the Prime Minister,that a Cossack was absolutely a true Russian in every sense. TheCossacks had originally been sent to the Crimea some 200 years before to maintain law and order. The peasants only held their land for four years, whereas the Cossack had been given his landfor his lifetime, and it could not be sold on his death. He (GeneralBriggs) was absolutely certain that the population in the terri-tories occupied by General Denekin would vote against the Bol-sheviks, and he was also of opinion that 85 per cent, of the people in Central Russia were anti-Bolshevist, but could not say so, asimmediately they did they were murdered. It had been thoughtthat the Cossack would not fight out of his own. area, but this hadbeen disproved by the fact that the Kuban Cossack was now fight-ing 400 miles out of his own territory, and there was noreason why he should not go further. General Briggs believedthat about 75 per cent, of General Denekin&apos;s army was composedof Cossacks, and the remaining 25 per cent, of townspeople from south. Russia. An enormous number of people from CentralRussia had come down into the territories now occupied by general denekin, and their wives and families were scattered all over thecountry. As stated in his memorandum, the population in the territories over which General Denekin held sway numbered about60,000,000. General Briggs then explained, with the aid of a map, the area which might truly be said to be the Cossack area.General Denekin had now practically reached the limit of this area,and had gone beyond it in one case.The Chancellor of the Exchequer asked, if it was decided toassist General Denekin in everything except men, what wereGeneral Brig^s&apos; views as to his requirements.General Briggs was of opinion that General Denekin shouldbe given strong moral support, a loan of 2,000,000/. to developtrade, and a friendly guarantee that Great Britain would not leavethe people of South Russia in the lurch. He agreed with thePrime Minister that the country was a, very rich one. He would point out, however, that it was not possible to say whether theterritory in front of General Denekin. which might possibly be occupied by him, had been properly cultivated. When the Bol-sheviks occupied any territory the land was nationalised and the peasants refused to work. If this turned out to be the situationin the territories to the north of General Denekin, no doubt therewould be a shortage. On the other hand, it was possible that, if -the people expected an advance by General Denekin, they mighthave continued to cultivate the land, in which case there would beplenty. In the area occupied by General Denekin&apos;s army therewas, generally speaking, not a patch which was not cultivated, andthe country reminded one of Belgium. There was, however, one area in the hands of General Denekin of which only about one-fourth of the ground was cultivated. This was due to the factthat, during the Bolshevist occupation, all the oxen and horses hadbeen taken away, and General Denekin had now got to feed thepopulation in this district. In reply to a question by the PrimeMinister, General Briggs explained that he had discussed withGeneral Denekin&apos; the possibility of an advance against Astrakhan.
He thought it was General Deriekin&apos;s idea that, if he got on to theVolga, Astrakhan would fall automatically. It must be remem-bered that a civil war was being fought, and General Denekin was anxious that as few people as possible should be killed. GeneralBriggs further explained that the country to the south ofAstrakhan was very difficult for military operations.The Chancellor of the Exchequer asked if it was not the case that the further General Denekin advanced, the greater would be his requirements in food ?General Briggs thought that this might be so if, as he hadalready said, the country had not been cultivated by the peasants.It must be remembered, however, that if a Russian wanted a starhe asked for the moon, and he (General Briggs) suggested that itwas only necessary to say that Great Britain would not allow thesepoor people to be starved.Some discussion then ensued as to the financial position ofGeneral Denekin, during which General Briggs explained thatGeneral Denekin was in the position of a beggar, and was depen-dent on friends for gifts of money. Only that morning he had heard of one financial firm which had given to General Denekina gift of 1,000,000 roubles. General Denekin received no taxes,but existed partly on the surplus of rouble notes printed by the don press. General Denekin had asked General Briggs to getrouble notes printed for him in London, but he could not do this as he had no means of paying for the printing. If a loan of2,000,000Z. was made to General Denekin he would be able to pay for such services as this, and also buy commodities in England,and there would be no necessity for the money to go out ofEngland. He thought that with a loan of 2,000,OO0Z. most ofGeneral Denekin&apos;s financial troubles would diminish very con-si derably.The President of the Board of Trade pointed out that,000,000Z. would not be anything like sufficient to pay for thedemands already received.The Prime Minister was of opinion that the advance of2,000,000Z. would he analogous to putting water in a pump inorder to set it going.The Chancellor of the Exchequer referred to the insurancescheme which the Board of Trade had been operating.Mr. Bonar Law asked if the cheapest solution would not beto present General Denekin with some paper and a printing press for making rouble notes.General Briggs said that the Stavropol area had never aspiredto having local councils, and had given General Denekin all thecorn produced in the district, in return for which they had accepted I.O.U.&apos;s from General Denekin. These wretched people were not now in a position to buy any commodities.Some discussion then took place regarding the fact thatGeneral Denekin received no taxes, during which the PrimeMinister pointed out that it was possible to get any people on one&apos;s side if they were not taxed.Dr. Addison asked if the Bolsheviks were doing propagandawork behind General Denekin&apos;s line.General Briggs replied that this was so. They were spendingmillions of money for the purpose, not only in the territories occu-pied by General Denekin but also&apos; in other countries. By doing this in General Denekin&apos;s territory they were able to pay with theKerensky and Imperial rouble, which had a fictitious value.Mr. Barnes said he was convinced that we should not be wisein giving any permanent undertaking to help General Denekin.The Prime Minister pointed out that Mr. Barnes had pro-oosed a time-limit, and that the Secretary of State for War had himself suggested a limit of six months, when the whole question should again be reviewed. He did not think it was possible forthe Cabinet to discuss the matter further until Lord Curzon&apos;s[495]c
Paper was available. He was very glad that the Cabinet had hadan opportunity of consulting General Briggs and of obtaining somuch valuable information from him.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he would like to havea clear definition as to what was meant by continuing to assistGeneral Denekin for the time being on the same lines as hitherto;did it mean that the War Office was merely to give him surpluscstores, or were the War Office to buy extra stores if the necessarysurplus stores were not available ? .The Secretary of State for War said that he was getting, asit were, a renewal of his lease for six, months, and he would liketo have some petty cash which he could spend, if necessary. Asum of 100,000/. would quite satisfy him until the Cabinet hadLord Curzon&apos;s Paper and the question was further discussed.The Minister of Shipping pointed out that this sum wouldnothing like cover the shipping expenses.The Chancellor of the Exchequer called attention to the factthat, although the Secretary of State for War said surplus storeshad no. value, all these stores had been shown in the Estimates asa credit, the value being that. estimated by the Minister ofSupplies.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff, in reply to a ques-tion by the Prime Minister, explained that the stores which hadbeen given to General Denekin up to date included equipment,rifles, machine-guns, hospitals, travelling kitchens, and uniforms.Mr. Fisher asked if fighting would have to cease in south russia during the winter months.General Briggs was of opinion that this would not be so.The Bolsheviks numbered five times as many as General Denekin&apos;forces, and the latter would have to continue fighting for1 their lives throughout the winter. .Dr. Addison asked how it would alter the situation on general, Denekin&apos;s front if the Bolsheviks ^finally disposed of admiral Kolchak&apos;s forces.General Briggs did not think it would make very muchdifference, as General Denekin&apos;s army was rapidly swelling.Some discussion then ensued regarding the sending back toGermany of the German prisoners who were in England, and the. amount which could be saved by demobilising the men who were now guarding these prisoners, during which the Chief of theImperial General Staff explained that the War Office werewaiting for instructions from Paris.The War Cabinet decided  5(a.) To postpone the further consideration of the assistanceto be given to General Denekin until the Paper whichwas being prepared by the Acting Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs was available.(6.) That, pending the further consideration of the question,the War Office should be allowed to expend a sum notexceeding 100,000/. for the provision of stores andequipment which were not obtainable from surplusstocks.Price of Hay and 4. The War Cabinet had under consideration the followingTown Supplies.       (Papers on the subject of the Price of Hay and Town Supplies: Memorandum bv the President of the Board of Trade (Paper        &apos;VG.T.-7675). &quot; .      memorandum by the President of the Board of Agricultureand Fisheries (Paper G.T.-7704).Memorandum by the Shipping Controller (Paper G.T.-7719).Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Paper G.T.-7730).
Memorandum by the Minister of Munitions (paper g.T.-7772).The President of the Board of Trade said that the questionof the control of the 1919 hay crop had been under considerationnow for over four months, and a decision on the part of theGovernment was urgently necessary.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that the generalconsensus of opinion, as evidenced by the majority of PapersIbefore the Cabinet, was adverse to the President of the Board ofTrade&apos;s proposals.The Food Controller remarked that his department wasclosely concerned, as cattle and milk prices were involved.The Prime Minister stated that an important question ofprinciple was involved, and he thought that, in the first instance,it should be examined by the Home Affairs Committee and should only come to the Cabinet in case of disagreement.The War Cabinet decided &quot; To remit the question to the Home Affairs Committee, withthe request that, in view of the urgency of the matter, itshould receive the Committee&apos;s consideration at theearliest possible date.5. With reference to War Cabinet 569, Minute 1 (d), theWar Cabinet had before them the following Papers dealing withthe question of Housing after the War: Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, covering a memo-randum by the First Commissioner of Works (Paper G.T.-7432).Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (paper g.T.-7707).Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, covering Report of conference on Sale to Local Authorities of Temporary Huts andHostels (Paper G.T.-7824).Memorandum bv the Minister of Labour (Use of MilitaryHuts) (Paper G.T.-7780).The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the question arose from a memorandum which had been submitted to him by the first commissioner of Works (Paper G.T.-7432) proposing: (1.) That the Office of Works should take over and completeall outstanding housing schemes, it being open tofurther consideration as to whether those houses whichare only in an early stage of development should be proceeded with, either by Government, or by localauthorities, or abandoned entirely.(2.) That negotiations for the disposal of houses immediatelyshould be dealt with by the Local Government Board,or the sale of the houses effected by the DisposalsBoard.(3.) That a Conference be called between the Treasury,Ministry of Munitions, Local Government Board, andthe Office of Works, to discuss and decide the question.As large principles of public policy were raised, he had summoneda conference of representatives of the departments concerned toconsider the above proposals. The conclusions at which the con-ference arrived were given in his own memorandum (paper g.T.-7707) and were as follows: (1.) That the Office of Works should take over and completeall outstanding housing schemes, it being open tofurther consideration as to whether those houses whichare only in an early stage of development should be
proceeded with, either by Government, or by localauthorities, or abandoned entirely, but any new scheme&apos; or doubtful scheme should be referred to the Ministryof Health and the Treasury for their concurrencebefore action..(2.) That it is undesirable that the Government should itselfmanage houses, and that every effort should thereforebe made to transfer Government houses to localauthorities, or, failing them, to approved public utilitysocieties.(3.) That the Ministry of Health should undertake the required negotiations with local authorities and publicutility societies in conference with the department ordepartments concerned and the Treasury.(4.) That temporary buildings should be no exception to therules above stated in (2) and (3).(5.) That the terms on which temporary huts are to be soldshould be reconsidered by the Treasury, Ministry ofHealth, and the Ministry of Munitions in co-operation,the object being to find a fair price at which they canbe offered to and used by the local authorities to helpin solving the existing housing problem.It was agreed that the price for this purpose wouldhave to be less than the prices now secured by theDisposals Board for individual sales.(6.) That the Army Council be requested to expedite the handing over of hutments to the Ministry of Munitions.Mr. Chamberlain said that he had no hesitation in recommending the adoption of the above proposals by the War Cabinet, with thepossible exception of those which referred to temporary huts, and suggested that the question of these huts might be considered bythe Home Affairs Committee.The Minister of Health expressed agreement . with theChancellor of the Exchequer, and hoped that the above Committeewould also be asked to consider the question of the sale to localauthorities of hostels (Paper G.T.-7824).The Minister of Labour doubted whether the local authorities could be induced to take any interest in the question of the tem-porary huts.The War Cabinet decided  &apos; .(a.) To accept the recommendations made in the Chancellorof the Exchequer&apos;s memorandum of the 15th July, 1919(Paper G.T.-7707), except so far as temporary, hutswere concerned. ,(&amp;.) To refer the question of temporary, huts and hostels(Paper G.T.-7824), and also that of the use of mili-tary huts for housing civilian workers (paper g.T.-7780), to the Home Affairs Committee.Assistance to Local. Authorities in.carrying out PublicWorks other thanHousing.6. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary for Scotland (Paper G.T.-7545) on the.question ofAssistance to Local Authorities in Carrying out Public Worksother than Plousing.The Secretary for Scotland said that the EdinburghDivisional Office of the Ministry of Labour had issued a circularnotifying local authorities in Scotland to press on public works with a view to the relief of unemployment. A conference of localauthorities had recently been held to consider the question, repre-sentatives coming from, several counties as well as the principalcities of Scotland, and had passed resolutions urging the Govern-ment to grant to local authorities such financial assistance as would enable them to overcome the present high cost of materials
The Position of the 7  with  reference to War Cabinet  600,  Minute   1, thethe Bakers. Minister of Labour said that he thought it right that the WarCabinet should know of the position with regard to a possiblestrike of bakers on the following clay. There were demands bothby the employers and employees. The latter asked for 4Z. a week,together with the abolition of night-baking. The Committeewhich had been appointed to report on the question of night-baking had favoured its abolition after two years. As regardsthe employers, they would neither meet the men nor put the matter to arbitration. They said they had been promised in the pastadditions to the subsidy, on the ground of increased cost of labourand materials. The Ministry of Food held that the demands ofthe employers in this connection were unjustified. The employersnow said that, unless the Food Controller promised \d. increasein the price of the loaf, they would refuse to enter into negotia-tions with the men. That morning, however, the employers had informed him that they wanted Id. added to the price of the loaf.The Food Controller had told the employers that, if they would submit the matter to arbitration, the whole situation would be reviewed, and the question as to whether the price should beincreased would be considered. The Minister of Labour addedthat the position was somewhat alleviated by the fact that theco-operative bakers would not cease work,, and it was probable thatthe small bakers would carry on. Only the large bakeries would go out on strike, and, in his opinion, the strike could not last long.He thought no further concessions should be made.The Food Controller said that, some months ago, the master-bakers wanted either a decrease in the price of the flour sold tothem by the Government or an increase in the price of the loaf.He went into this matter personally, and came to the conclusion,after an examination by his costings experts, that the master-bakers had not made out a case. When the new demands on thepart of the men for an increase in wages and shorter hours hadbeen brought forward, the employers endeavoured to induce himto promise that, before going into the men&apos;s case, he would grant[495] Dand labour, and remitting to the Executive Committee the powerto take all necessary steps to obtain the above assistance.Mr. Munro said that on the 20th instant he had received a deputa-tion of the said Executive Committee, who stated that the localauthorities were sympathetic with the suggested acceleration ofpublic works, but financial considerations made it practically impossible to proceed with them at once; that the present cost was estimated at double the cost in 1914, and that local authorities were unwilling or unable to incur this increased expenditure at thepresent time, in view of the fact that in all probability at the endof another twelve months they would be able to do the work atconsiderably less cost. The conference suggested that grants should be made for such purposes as public health, roads, water-works, police stations, gas, electricity and tramway works,markets, parks, &amp;c, and that the amount of grant should be50 per cent, of the expenditure when a contract is placed within two months.Mr. Bonar Law urged that the request of the Scottish localauthorities was unreasonable, for if the Government stoppedpaying the unemployment donation the burden would fall on thelocal authorities themselves.The Minister of Health pointed out that, owing to theshortage of building labour, the encouragement of public works at this time was bound adversely to affect the housing programme.The War Cabinet decided To authorise the Secretary for Scotland to refuse the applica-tion of the local authorities for financial assistance.
them an increase in the price of the loaf, or a reduction in theprice of flour. After examining this question, he had come tothe conclusion that, if the employers conceded all the demands ofthe men, it would only be necessary to increase the price of theloaf by \d. The employers had asked to see his representativethat morning, and he had authorised his representative to make tothem the following statement: &quot; I am authorised to state that, when determining theamount of any necessary increase, the Food Controller willtake into account all the factors that govern the cost of pro-duction of bread at the present time.&quot;In order to carry out that undertaking, he was prepared to havethe whole question examined by the Costings Department of theMinistry of Food.   .The War Cabinet approved the action which had been takenby the Food Controller.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,August 1, 1919.
