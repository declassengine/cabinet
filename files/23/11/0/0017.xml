Thanks ofParliament to thePorces.1. With reference to a statement in the House of Commons onthe previous day, by the Leader of the House, that it was intended that a motion that the thanks of Parliament be accorded to the Forcesof the Crown for their services in the war should be proposed beforethe recess,The Minister of Education undertook, at the request of thePrime Minister, to prepare a draft motion for the PrimeMinisters consideration.Situation in Eussia.2. With reference to War Cabinet 601, Minute 4, draftdecision (j), Mr. Barnes drew the attention of the War Cabinet tothe fact that no limitati m of time was named in respect of theassistance which was to be continued to General Denekin on thesame lines as hitherto.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he also had intendedto raise this question, and asked for further information as to whatexactly was meant by this conclusion, i.e., was our assistance to belimited to surplus stores, and so on ?The War Cabinet decided that The question could not be discussed in fthe absence of theSecretary of State for War,and directed The Acting Secretary to place it on the Agenda for the following day.Post-war office accommodation.3. The First Commissioner of Works said that, before theWar Cabinet proceeded to discuss the questions on the agenda paper for the day, he wished to raise a small point arising out ofthe last Meeting, when Office Accommodation had been underconsideration (War Cabinet 597, Minute 4). He had understood atthat Meeting that it had been decided that he should be authorisedto evacuate the building now occupied by the Sugar Commissionand to arrange for accommodation for the Commission elsewhere.No such decision, however, had been recorded in the Minutes. TheStaff of the Commission numbered only sixty, whereas the occupiedpremises were sufficient for 400 persons.Mr. Bonar Law said that, according to his recollection, adecision to this effect would have been reached had it not been forthe very strong representations made by the Food Controller.At the suggestion of the Prime Minister, the War cabinet decided To ask Mr. Barnes to interview (a) the Food Controller on their behalf and explain to him that the War Cabinet were very strongly of opinion that the Sugar Commission shouldvacate the premises now occupied by them, and be accomodated elsewhere ; (6) the Chairman of the sugar commission, in regard to the new accommodation whichwould be provided by the First Commissioner of Works.The President of the Board of Trade referred to paragraph 19of the Report of Lord Cave&apos;s Committee (Paper G.-253), which, wasappointed to examine the question of Government machinery dealingwith trade and commerce, and quoted the. following extract: &quot; We are convinced that matters can never be placed upon asatisfactory footing until the Department of Overseas Tradeis housed in close contact, and, indeed, under the same roofwith the Foreign Office and the Board of Trade. We under-stand that .the question of accommodation has already been pressed upon the Cabinet, and we desire to lay stress upon thefact that it is, in our opinion, the most important factor in thewhole problem which has been referred to us.&quot;
In his paper of the 1st July, paragraph 4 (j), the First Commis-sioner of Works had made the following recommendation : &quot;To remove the Admiralty Controllers staffs from theNew Public Offices to accommodation elsewhere, and, a most urgent demand having been received from the Board of trade for headquarters accommodation in the building, to reallocatethe whole of the space in the building in the following propor-tions.: &quot; Staff.&quot; Board of Education...   1,100   (To return from Kensington).&quot;Ministry of Health ...   1,300   (Estimated headquarters staff).&quot; Board of Trade     ...   1,100   (Concentrated accommodation for headquarters staff, in lieu of present scatteredpremises).&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Officeof Works ...   1,200&quot;Total       &apos; ...   4,700&quot;The First Commissioner of Works expressed the view that his recommendation could be carried out without difficulty if Depart-ments would recognise that they must be content with less accom-modation per person than they had before the war. As he had stated at the previous meeting, his experience was that departments had extravagant ideas of the amount of accommodation that wasnecessary. Nothing, however, could be done to give effect to his recommendation until the Admiralty Controller could be induced tovacate&apos; the New Public Offices.The First Lord of the Admiralty remarked that the FirstCommissioners comments upon extravagant ideas certainly did notapply to his Department, which was very heavily congested. he pointed out that the work in the Controller^ Department washeavier now than during the war, as it was busily engaged in thework of demobilisation and cutting down expenses generally. Thestaff of the Admiralty was very much scattered as it was, and theController&apos;s branch could not be divided up without serious loss of efficiency.The Minister of Ways and Communications said that four months previously the First Commissioner had assured him that his department would be housed in the premises occupied by theShipping Controller, and that the Ministry of Ways and communications would move into those premises as the ShippingControllers Department demobilised. The Ministry of Shipping,however, had since then steadily increased in size.* He urged that,if the Board of Trade were to move from the present building, theMinistry of Ways and Communications should be permitted to take their place.The First Commissioner of Works proposed to Sir Eric Geddesthat, as an alternative, his new Department. should move intoSt. Ermin&apos;s Hotel, for the further lease of which he thought hewould be able without difficulty to negotiate.Sir Eric Geddes pointed out that the accommodation in theabove hotel was very bad and extravagant. He suggested that as this building would only be temporarily leased, it would be better to put in it a moribund Department,&apos; such as the Ministry ofShipping.* Note. A note has been received from the Shipping&apos; Controller that this state-ment is not in accordance -with the actual facts. These are that while the staff of theMinistry of Shipping has decreased very considerably the necessity has arisen for bringing into the building in St. James&apos; Park the large number of staff which had&apos;previously been in other buildings. The total headquarter staff of the Ministry on-the 28th February, 1919, was 1,799, and, on the 30th June, 1,641. Acting Secretary,War Cabinet.
The Minister of Labour said that the hotel was now occupied bythe Training and Appointments Branch of his Ministry. He hopedthat if the lease was to be extended, that Department might beallowed to remain. He pointed out that, in the course of the last few months, the Training and Appointments Department had beenshifted on no less than three occasions, which caused great delay inthe conduct of business and very considerable inconvenience to soldiers and sailors.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary for the Colonies stated thatthe Colonial Office was appallingly overcrowded at present, and very seriously under-staffed. Some of the staff would find, on their return from Paris, that there was no longer any room for them.Even the passages were crowded up with cubicles, which wereinconvenient and not healthy, but it had been found necessary toprovide extra accommodation as the work of the Department had grown, for various reasons, e.g., East Africa. Their demands were relatively small, but very urgent, and he hoped that the WarCabinet would not lose sight of them.The First Lord of the Admiralty confirmed Colonel Amery&apos;sstatement, and said that of late years there had been a great increasein the work of administering the Crown colonies.The First Commissioner of Works suggested that an additionalstorey might be placed on the Colonial Office.The Financial Secretary to the War Office said that it had beensuggested that two storeys should similarly be added to the WarOffice.Mr. Barnes said that one of the First Commissioner^ recom-mendations was that the War Cabinet should sanction theconstruction of a huge new building on the site at present occupiedhy Whitehall Gardens and the Board of Trade, which wouldaccommodate no less than 17,000 people. He was rather alarmedat the prospect, as there was the question of transport to beconsidered ; the tubes, trams, and omnibuses were already crowdedto suffocation.The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet, at the previous meeting, had decided that all sections of Departments whosepresence was not essential in the Whitehall area should be moved to the suburbs.The Minister of Education said that he was quite prepared toplant out certain sections of his Departments, e.g.. the pensionssection, and others. It was, however, absolutely necessary that his headquarters should be in Whitehall. Grave inconvenience was caused to the public by the fact that his technical, continuation, andother branches were in South Kensington.The President of the Board of Trade said that he was certainthat the headquarters only of Departments need be housed in whitehall, and the routine branches could quite well be accomodated elsewhere.The Minister of Ways and Communications thought that theWar Cabinet had to decide an important principle, viz., were wholeDepartments to be expropriated from the Whitehall area, or onlycertain sections of all Government Departments ?The Chancellor of the Exchequer did not understand why the WarOffice should require a bigger building than before the war, moreespecially as the Air Ministry must have absorbed some of thepre-war staff.The Financial Secretary to the War Office pointed out that allkinds of new Technical Services, Tanks, Gas, Anti-Gas, &amp;c, hadbeen formed during the war.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that at the previous meeting the War Cabinet had instructed the Secretary to see SirMalcolm Ramsay. Unfortunately, Sir Maurice Hankey was unableto be present to make his report. He himself felt that they shouldnot contemplate two extra storeys to the War Office and the Admiralty
unless clear proof were forthcoming that these were necessary.   Hequite understood that, so long as a large number of men remainedundemobilised, there were difficulties in demobilising the existing(A staff of the War Office.   As regards the Admiralty, spacious new buildings had been built for its accommodation in quite recentyears.The First Lord of the Admiralty pointed out that certain Depart-ments of the Admiralty were now working at a considerable distance from Whitehall. In his view, great economy would be effected byconstructing two additional storeys. It was also for consideration whether the house which was previously at the disposal of the FirstLord, and was now used as a temporary office, should not be converted into permanent office buildings, with the exception of two historicrooms. The first thing that he did on taking over his presentDepartment was to go carefully into the question of what reduction in staff was possible. Speaking from memory only, he thought thatthe staff before the war was about 2,000 ; during the.war, 10,000,and now 8,000. This latter figure had amazed him, and he at oncecalled for reasons. The Permanent Secretary of the Admiralty, whowas as anxious as himself to effect all possible reductions, had con-vinced him that any very material diminution was impossible atpresent. The staff generally were much overworked, and many ofthem were working in unhealthy conditions, i.e., in insanitarycubicles.The Chancellor of the Exchequer siiggested that the War cabinet should call for a return from every Department showing (a.) The pre-war staff.(o.) The maximum staff during the war.(c.) The staff at the present day.[d.) What work, with staff, had been transferred to or from it during or after the war.-New Departments would, of course, only submit returns of the staffsduring and after the war.The Financial Secretary to the War Office, in reply to a question from the Prime Minister, said the War Office staff at the time of theArmistice was 15,800, and at the present day 12,234. Before thewar it had been about 2,500.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that the establish-ment of certain new Departments, e.g., Labour, Pensions, &amp;c, hadmeant that a good deal of work that had previously been performed by the older Ministries had been transferred to the newer creations,and yet the older Departments had not been able to reduce their staffs.The President of the Board of Trade said that a certain amountof work had been taken from his Department, but, on the other hand,accommodation had had to be found for various new sections andtheir staffs, e.g:, railways, timber, and coal.The First Lord of the Admiralty, in reply to a question by theChancellor of the Exchequer, said that he was examining thepossibility of more use being made of the Greenwich Hospitalpremises.The Prime Minister remarked that the staff of the War Officemust largely consist of the men employed for liquidating purposes,clearing up the aftermath of war, and were, consequently, temporaryonly.The Financial Secretary to the War Office said that there was a, large staff in the Imperial Institute dealing with questions of gatuities, &amp;c, of an intricate nature, requiring highly-trained men.He hoped that the work would be concluded in another five months&apos;time.   It would be fatal, however, to shift an organisation of that[472]C
kind. In the course of a few months his Department anticipatedthat there would be a very considerable and rapid shrinkage. Moreespecially would this be the case, when the question of pay had been finally settled.The Chancellor of the Exchequer read the following figuresfrom a paper which he had before him, showing the amount of staffsat present on the establishment of the different Departments; thereturn was dated the 23rd July, 1919 : Ministry of MunitionsMinistry of PensionsAir MinistryWar OfficeAdmiraltyMinistry of Labour ...Ministry of Shipping13,00014,0003,000.12,0009,0006,0001,700The Minister of Health said that he knew from his own experience how great was the difficulty in overcoming the reluctance of staffs to demobilise.Mr. Barnes suggested that a monthly report should besubmitted by all Departments, showing what reductions had been effected.The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought that the question wasnot merely that there was a certain number of people who were not&apos;fully occupied, but that there must be many cases in which officials and clerks were doing work which could be dispensed with. It waspossible that in some Departments there was duplication andexcessive record-keeping.The Minister of Education said that his Department had, fromthe beginning of the war, greatly reduced the work of their statisticalsection, which had made it very difficult on occasions to reply to parliamentary questions.The Prime Minister thought that the figures quoted by theChancellor of the Exchequer were very sensational, and expressedthe opinion that those numbers ought, in the&apos; course of a fewmonths, to be capable of reduction by one-half.. He suggested thatsomeone with special qualifications and experience should beappointed to go into the whole question on behalf of the Cabinet.The gigantic work performed during the war must rapidly becoming to an end, and he confessed that he was surprised that so little reduction had been carried out.The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought that whoever wasappointed to conduct the investigation must be a man witha knowledge of departmental work and departmental responsibility.&quot;As he had already suggested, the main thing was to discover whatpeople were doing unnecessary work.The President of the Board of Trade stated that that wasexactly what he himself had tried to find out as Minister of Recon-struction. He had, however, come to the conclusion that no outsideman&apos; could get inside knowledge of the working of GovernmentDepartments in less than six months. No one but the minister himself was really competent to decide what reductions could beeffected. He suggested that whoever was appointed, whether he were head of a Department or an official or a business man from outside, might propose the staff.that he considered necessary, and itwould then be for the Minister in charge of the Department con-cerned to justify any establishment in excess of the same.The Minister of Ways and Communications thought that novery useful suggestions could be expected from a man who wasnot well acquainted with the Government system of preservingrecords, &amp;c. A purely business man would not understand thenecessity for such a system and might well make recommendations which it would be impossible to carry out. He himself thought thebest way to proceed would be to ask a Minister to submit returns
showing his present staff and making recommendations as to itsreduction in other words, to what extent he thought it possible to&quot; ration &quot; his Department. A Minister might then be appointed bythe War Cabinet to undertake a proper co-ordination of the statistics returned by Departments, and to suggest to what extent the &quot; rationing &quot; might be modified.The Financial Secretary to the War Office said while LordInverforth was at the War Office two of his business men assistantswere appointed to examine the work of various branches of the WarOffice and to make recommendations. After six weeks spent in the quartermaster Generabs Department they had submitted a report which had practically no useful result. In effect, the result of their examination was nugatory, as it had been impossible for them in thatshort space of time fully to understand the working of the branch.He thought that the &quot;ration system&quot; might be tried with great advantage, and he suggested that Departments should be instructedto reduce their present staffs by a given percentage-within a givenlength of time. The head of the Department would be left tojustify any failure to reach the required figure.The Minister of Education thought that the adoption of this method would pay in the case of Departments whose establishmentshad been greatly swollen for the purposes of the war. he submitted, however, that his own Department stood upon a different footing, as it had been necessary to increase it since the war.The Prime Minister thought that, the first thing to do wasto ask for returns as suggested by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,and to appoint somebody to examine and circulate these returnswith his own estimate of the reduction that might be achievedwithin the next three months.The First Lord of the Admiralty suggested that the period within which the reduction should be effected should be increased from three to six months. As regards war expenditure, theAdmiralty had in the last quarter spent more than they had in any similar period during the war. The reason of this was that theyhad to get rid of their outstanding commitments.The Chancellor of the Exchequer proposed that both datesshould be taken ; that the returns should be submitted within aweek, and that the London staffs only should.be included.The Minister of Health suggested that the Minister, or other person, appointed to conduct the enquiry, should consider whatSections of various Departments could be moved from the whithall area.Mr. Bonar Law reminded the AVar Cabinet that they hadalready decided that the Headquarters of Departments only shotddbe accommodated in Whitehall, and that the remainder should be housed in the suburbs and elsewhere.The First Commissioner of Works thought that it wouldbe difficult to separate, for instance, Finance and Contracts Branches.If these were kept apart, great delay must result.The First Lord of the Admiralty explained the function of theAdmiralty Controllers Department, which was really a NavalMinistry of Munitions. This branch was self-contained, and itcould not be split tip. without great loss of efficiency.The Prime Minister expressed his opinion that for the admiralty to continue building ships on an extensive scale was pure profligacy.The. German Fleet had been sunk, and there was nothing to justifysuch action.The Chancellor of the Exchequer urged that it was essentialthat real and substantial economies should be effected at once. in five years&apos; time the situation might be reviewed, and we might thenbe once more in a position to construct ships to meet futureeventualities.The President of the Board of Trade reminded the WarCabinet that the previous week they had accepted the Cave Report,
which had, as he had already stated, insisted on the necessity for providing proper accommodation for his own Department at once ;and this, as the First Commissioner had pointed out, involved theremoval of the Admiralty Controller^ Department.The First Commissioner of Works thought. that 600 membersof the Admiralty Controllers Stall: might be located in the Board ofTrade Offices, and the remainder accommodated in requisitionedpremises, the continued retention of which, however would causes considerable outcry.The President of the Board of Trade said that the question of the rehabilitation of our trade was one which was absolutely vital tothe country. The resumption of our trade was at present crippledowing to lack of suitable accommodation. The provision of thisaccommodation was held up owing to the inflation of the WarDepartments. AVhatever rearrangement was decided upon, some-body was bound to be inconvenienced ; but he submitted that atthis juncture the last Department to suffer was the Board of Trade,whose first and urgent business it was to get our overseas tradegoing once more.The Minister of Education said that it was essential that thebulk of his staff should be brought back to Whitehall.The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought that the First Lordmight move from the Admiralty offices all, except the heads of, hisPay and Pension branches.The First Lord of tbe Admiralty said that he had hadexperience of a divided office when he had been Chief Secretary for ireland. At that time the Irish Party formed a powerful section inthe Commons, and his difficulties had been extreme. He had suggested to the Admiralty Controller that it might be necessary tomove his staff, and the Controller had represented that if this werethe case serious delays were bound to ensue. That department was more concerned than any other in cutting down expenditure,but he did not see how he was to carry out his undertakings in thisrespect, if that Department were removed.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that his suggestion had been that the routine sections of the branch of the Accountant-General of the Admiralty might be accommodated elsewhere.The First Lord of the Admiralty promised that me would see hisheads of branches that afternoon and ascertain what could be done.The Prime Minister suggested that practically the whole of theAccountant-General&apos;s branch might be moved from the Admiralty,and that in the offices thus vacated 1,000 of the personnel of theControllers Department might be accommodated, while the remaining700 could be housed in the offices now occupied by the Board ofTrade.The Minister of Health enquired what provision would be madefor such sections of Departments as could be moved from the whithall area.Mr. Bonar Law said that he agreed with the point of view putforward by the President of the Board of Trade. During the warthe convenience of all civil Departments had had to be sacrificed forthe purposes of the expanded war Departments. Now, however,the reverse was the case, and in his view the civil Departments hada prior,claim to consideration. This was the case with the Boardof Trade.The Financial Secretary to the War Office hoped that nothingthat was done would be allowed to interfere with the smoothprogress of demobilisation.The President of the Board of Trade said that the Governmenthad decided that the Cave Report should be published. Directlythis was done increased pressure from every part of the country would be brought to bear upon his Department. At present both theDepartment of Overseas Trade and his own Department were dottedabout all over the place, which was having disastrous consequences.
Mr. Bonar Law suggested that all Departments should submit their own cases to the Prime Minister, who should have final powersof deciding which must give way.The President of the Board of Education said that if his Depart-ment, or any portion of it, was to be removed, the month of Augustwas the most convenient time.The First Commissioner of Works asked if the Prime Ministerssuggestion was to be adopted, how he was to provide accommodation for the Accountant Generafs branch at the Admiralty.The Prime Minister pointed out that the First Commissioner inhis own report had recommended the Admiralty Controllers Depart-ment should be removed from the new public offices to accommodationelsewhere, and he presumed that the First Commissioner had made provision accordingly.The Minister of Health thought that the First commissioner should be given Cabinet authority to provide outside accommodation.Mr. Barnes enquired whether the Crystal Palace premises couldnot be utilised.The First Commissioner of AVorks asked for authority to retain the Strand House premises, though of course not indefinitely.The Minister of Ways and Communications reminded the WarCabinet that the Admiralty Controller^ Department was not a per-manent one, and would rapidly be demobilised. He thought,therefore, that it was not entitled to equal consideration with otherDepartments of a more permanent character.The Prime Minister suggested that the Strand House might beretained until the end of the year, by which time a very considerablecompression would have been effected.The First Commissioner of Works said that he thought thataccommodation for the Ministry of Ways and Communications might,be found south of the river.Sir Arther Durrant said that accommodation existed in the head-quarters offices of the Board of Trade for some 600 or 700 officials and clerks, and that the remainder of the Controller of the Navy&apos;staff could be accommodated in Cornwall House if the Ministry ofLabour staff were not transferred thereto from St. Ermin&apos;s Hotel.The First Commissioner of Works suggested that theAdmiralty&apos;s Controllers Department might be split up into two, one part being located in the Strand House, and one south of the- river.This would not involve shifting the Accountant Generals departmentof the Admiralty, and would save unnecessary moves.The Prime Minister thought that the War Cabinet might decideprovisionally that the Admiralty Controller^ Department shouldvacate the new public offices and be provided with accommodationas suggested by the First Commissioner of Works, subject to anyrepresentation that might be made to him by the First Lord of theAdmiralty after consultation with the Admiralty Controller.The War Cabinet decided (a.) To accept provisionally Recommendation 7 of the first commissioner of Works in his memorandum of the&quot;1st July (Paper G.T.-7598)-&quot; To remove the Admiralty Controller^ staffs fromthe New Public Offices to accommodation elsewhere, andto re-allocate the whole of the space in the buildings inthe following proportions : Staff.&quot; Board of Education... ... ...   1,100&quot;Ministry of Health ... ... ...   1,300&quot; Board of Trade      ... ...   &apos;      ...   1,100&quot; His Majesty&apos;s Office of Works ...   1,200&quot;Total      ... ... ...   4,700,&quot;[472j - D
subject to any representation tbat migbt be made to thePrime Minister by the First Lord of the Admiralty, afterthe latter had consulted with the Admiralty Controller ;the offices vacated by the Board of Trade to be allocated to the Ministry of Transport.(b.) That every Department shordd submit, not later than the7th August, 1919, to the Secretary of the War Cabinet,a return showing -(i.) The size of the staff and establishment main-. tained before the war :(ii.) The maximum staff and establishment reached at any period during the war :(iii.) The staff and establishment maintained at thepresent date: -(iv.) What work, and accompanying staff and establishment, had been transferred to theDepartment concerned, during or after thewar : a statement of the extra staff and establishment, involved by the transference of the said work, to be included :(v.) What drastic reduction in staff and establish-ment the Department concerned believed it possible to effect (a.) within three months, and(b.) within six months of the present date :(vi.) The above returns and estimates to be confined,in the first instance, to the staff and establishments maintained in London only.(c.) That the question of an official, or other person, if any, to scrutinise and make recommendations in regard to theabove returns and estimates (vide (6) above), be reservedfor consideration at a later date.Ownership of 4. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the petroleum in the Minister of Munitions (Paper G.T.-7731) relating to the question ofUnited Kingdom.     ^e ownership of petroleum produced in the United Kingdom.The Minister of Munitions said that seven wells had been sunkin the Chesterfield area, one of which was producing at the rate of400 gallons a day. in three of the other wells the depth at whichpetroleum could be tapped had not yet been reached. The totalexpense of the operations up to date was 35O,000Z. He feared that,so far, the results from a commercial point of view had been disappointing.With regard to his memorandum now before the Cabinet, he wished for a decision regarding the question as to whether the oilshould belong entirely to the owner of the surface, to be disposedof as he pleased, or whether the latter should be allowed a limitedright of property, measured by a fixed royalty, or whether owner-ship of the oil should be vested solely in the State.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, as he understood the position, the Scottish shale oilfields had been worked fora number of years, and the owners were drawing royalties. Withregard to the oilfields now being exploited, no steps had been takento work them before, and the property had been bought and soldon the assumption that it did not contain oil. It was obvious thatthe rights of the Scottish oilfields should be recognised, but surelythe State was entitled to own oil which they obtained from fieldsnow being worked for the first time at the State&apos;s expense.
The Secretary for Scotland said that on the 31st July, 1918,Sir L. Worthington Evans laid before the Home Affairs Committeea draft of the Petroleum Production Bill, which embodied theproposal now brought forward by the Minister of Munitions. after a long discussion, the Home Affairs Committee had adopted thepolicy of the Bill, and authorised its introduction in the House ofCommons. That Bill and the present proposal were both in line with the advice given by the Lord Advocate more than a year ago.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he had been incharge of a Bill which gave the State the right to the ownership of the oil, but allowed the property owners a small royalty. this bill had not been passed, and the question of the ownership ofthe oil had never been decided. He himself doubted whether theState wotdd benefit if a small royalty to the owners was not given,as the owner would then be entitled to compensation for the injurydone to his property. For example, the oilfields on the Duke of devonshire&apos;s property between Matlock and Buxton, when in fullworking order might destroy the amenities of these towns, in which case the Duke would be entitled to a large sum for compensation.On the other hand, there was no doubt that the feeling in theHouse^ of Commons against the payment of a royalty was very strong, and was not confined to one party only, but was widespread.When in charge of the Bill in the House of Commons, he proposedthat the question of property rights should be left to be decided in the Law Courts, but the House would not hear of this course. he feared that, if a Bill was again introduced, it would meet with serious difficulties when it reached the House of Lords.Sir John Cadman . said that the work now in progress inDerbyshire and elsewhere was being carried out under the powersof the Defence of the Realm Act, and one action was pending andothers threatened by property owners to remove the government from the land. At one borehole there was a certain amount of oilwaiting to be removed, but, should the Government remove it, theywould be faced with an action brought by the property owner,claiming that the oil did not belong to the Government. Thequestion was whether cases of this nature should be allowed to go tothe Law Courts, or whether the Government should deal with thematter by means of a Bill. With regard to the prospects of theundertaking it was too early to say what the ultimate production would be, but the tests so far might fairly be described as promising.The Minister of Health said he was certain the House ofCommons would not listen to any proposal that royalties should bepaid to surface-owners. The question to be decided was whetherthis oil was vested in the State or the owner of the land. In hisopinion, there was no doubt that the State.shotdd own it, especiallyin view of the fact that the Sankey Commission recommendedthat the State should acquire all minerals. He hoped that thepolicy of the Government would be announced immediately. Toallow matters to drift into the Law Courts would place the Governmentin a humiliating position.The Minister of Pensions said that two Bills had been introduced into the House of Commons relating to this question, the first of whichhad provided for a 9d. per ton royalty to be paid to the property owners.This Bill had not passed through the House. The second bill which had, however, passed into law, only preserved everybody&apos;srights and settled nothing. The big question as to who was theowner of the oil had not been faced. His opinion was that theState should not recognise the right of the surface-owner to any oilfound on his ground. The owner should, however, be liberallycompensated for any damage to the surface and loss of amenitieswhich might result from the oilfields on his property being worked.The Minister of Labour concurred generally in the views expressed by the Minister of Pensions, and emphasized the practical difficulty of identifying the owner of any particular oil supply. Inthis respect oil contrasted with coal.
Mr. Bonar Law said that the existence of oil was an entirely new discovery, and did not enter into the calculations of thosebuying and selling the land. In his view, no royalty should bepaid.
