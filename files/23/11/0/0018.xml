The President of the Board of Trade stated that the railway situation. situation gave cause for anxiety.   The men&apos;s representatives had.refused to continue the negotiations which had been going on since february, and had declined to abide by the agreement then arrivedat. This decision had been brought about over a failure to agreeas to the rates of the new standard wage, and the amount to be deducted from the War Bonus and added to the permanent wage.The additional cost of the men&apos;s demands was being worked out byhis Department, but in the meantime the matter had been referredto the Railway Executive Committee.With regard to the announcement of the Railway Executivef( Committee (War Cabinet 002, Minute 8) to the effect that it wouldbe necessary for the guaranteed Week to be suspended in the caseof those men for whom work could not be found, in consequence ofthe falling off of traffic due to the miners&apos; strike, Sir auckland geddes stated that his action, directing the Committee to suspendthis instruction until the matter had been considered, had been followed by the threatened resignation of the Railway Executive[493] B
Committee. He had, however, now prevailed upon them to canceltheir resignation.Sir Eric Geddes said that the Railway Companies had neverbefore dismissed regular employees when work could not be found for them, but had only suspended them.The President of the Board of Trade said that he was seeingMr. J. H. Thomas on the following morning. The whole positionlooked to him as if the men were trying to bring about an industrialquarrel to coincide with the political quarrel on direct action.2. With reference to War Cabinet 598, Minute 2, the PrimeMinister said that, if there was going to be trouble with the triple alliance, it was necessary for the Cabinet to consider whether theywould fight on the basis of their whole industrial policy. It.was essential that this policy should be decided at the earliest possible moment. He would, therefore, be glad if Ministers would carefullyread the Reports of the Commission on the Nationalisation of mines. He had seen Lord Gainford, who was the spokesman of the mine-owners before the Commission, and Lord Gainford had senthim a report, which in some respects showed that the owners wereprepared to go some considerable distance towards the adoption ofthe Duckham Report.The President of the Board of Education said that he assumed that, if the Cabinet decided on adopting anything less than theSankey Report, the Triple Alliance would strike.The Prime Minister said that he doubted if the Triple Alliancewould strike if the Government went a long way towards meetingthe demands of the more moderate section of the men.The War Cabinet instructed-The Acting Secretary to prepare a dossier of the following documents, so that Ministers might peruse them over theweek-end :- -Second&apos;Report of the Coal Commission,Lord Gainfor.d&apos;s proposals,Sir Thomas Ratcliffe-Ellis&apos;s proposals,Sir H. Llewellyn Smith&apos;s proposals, andThe articles in the &quot; Times &quot;by Dr.&apos; Shadwell.3. Mr. Bonar Law stated that, in the Debate on the Address,the question had been raised by Mr. Adamson of the payment ofthe railway fares of Members of Parliament between London andtheir constituencies. In support of the proposal, Mr. Adamson had brought to him (Mr. Bonar Law) a petition signed by only a verysmall number of members, which included the names of none ofthe Independent Liberals. He had at the time pointed out to-Mr. Adamson that, since only the Labour Party appeared to be infavour of the proposition, it would not be advisable to press it then.Recently, Mr. Adamson had brought him another petition on thesame subject, and this was signed by members of the Labour Party,the Independent Liberals, and of the Coalition altogether therewere over 200 signatures. There might be a great deal to be saidagainst this concession, but a big argument in favour of grantingit was that it would tend to equalise the position as between, say,a Member of Parliament whose constituency was in the north ofScotland, and another whose constituency lay in the Home Counties.He (Mr. Bonar Law) was in favour of the proposal, the strongestargument against which was that it came at a time when theGovernment proposed to raise the status of several Ministerial offices,and would thus lay itself open to attacks in the Press of attempting to bribe Parliament to raise the salaries of Ministers by grantingthis concession to members.
The Secretary of State for War expressed the opinion that therewas really nothing to he said against the proposal. In the services a free warrant was issued to any officer or man travelling on duty,and there was no doubt in his mind that the same concession should be granted to Members of Parliament. The working-classeswould be in favour of it as reasonable and fair.Mr. Barnes said it was very important that, at the present time,when members of the Independent Labour Party were carrying on propaganda throughout the country, Members of Parliament shouldhave facilities for travelling to their constituencies.The Chancellor of the Exchequer expressed himself as entirely in favour of the proposal. Once the principle of the payment ofmembers had been accepted-and he thought that even those members who had voted against that principle when it was firstintroduced did not now desire to repeal it there was no reason for not conceding travelling expenses to and from their constituencies,so that all members might have equal facilities in attending to public duties, A point that should be considered, however, was whether the concession should be limited to journeys between.London and members&apos; constituencies. A number of members had their homes at some distance from their constituencies, and would naturally wish to spend some of their time at home.The Food Controller suggested that a Member of parliament should be given the option of going to his constituency or to his home each week.It was generally agreed, however, that the method of grantingan option would be difficult to defend in Parliament: the concession could then be interpreted as an addition to income.Mr. Bonar Law stated that, the principle having been accepted,it was then necessary to consider the method by which the conces-sion was to be made. He, with the President of the Board of Trade,had drawn up the following scheme : Any Member of Parliament, other than a member for a constituency within 10 miles of London, will, when the house is sitting, and at other times if he is serving on a Committeewhich is in session, be entitled to a voucher enabling him to travel by railway, free of charge, from London to any place inhis constituency and back to London. The number of suchvouchers not to exceed an average of one per week over theperiod during which the House is sitting.The voucher will be obtainable at the Vote Office at theHouse of Commons, and will be exchanged for a first-classreturn ticket at the booking-office on the main line station atwhich the journey- commences. Each voucher will be availablefor one week from the date of issue at the Vote Office.A record will be kept at the Vote Office of the vouchersissued. The vouchers to be returned by the railway companies to the Vote Office on the first, day of each month, and the full amount of the fares claimed to be paid to the company issuingthe return ticket and charged to the Vote for ............ ...These arrangements will apply to journeys partly by rail and partly by sea in cases in which return tickets are, in theordinary course, issued by railway companies for the whole^journey.Mr. Bonar Law, continuing, said that the main criticism that could be levelled against this scheme was a charge of meanness onthe part of the Government (1) in granting only one voucher perweek; (2) in granting vouchers only when the House was sitting.The reason for this, however, was that members living near Londonmight otherwise be inclined to use the vouchers instead of season tickets.The Food Controller said that it was not in keeping witb the[493] &apos; B 2
dignity of members of Parliament that they should be required toapply at the Vote Office every time they wanted a voucher to travel to their constituencies. His own feeling was that he would neverapply so long as he could afford to pay his own fare.The Prime Minister concurred in the views of the FoodController. There were a number of Labour members whosehomes lay just outside their constituencies, and who, while visitingtheir homes, did a great deal of the work connected with their constituencies. If a declaration was required from such memberseach time they applied for a voucher that they were going onduties connected with their constituencies, they might lay them-selves open to a charge of having made a false declaration. It wassurely not right to place any member in such a position. the concession would have much more value and would be muchmore appreciated if members were given a pass which they could use for journeys between London and their constituencies over awhole year, whether the House were sitting or not. In his opinionit should not be difficult, in view of the number of membersconcerned and the fact that the pass would be used on an averageperhaps not more than once a week, to come to some arrangement with the railway companies whereby these passes would be provided at a reduced, figure.   . -General agreement was expressed with the Prime Ministersviews. It was pointed out that a certain amount of criticism was inevitable, and that any increase in criticism, if the free pass for thewhole year were given, would be counterbalanced by the additionalappreciation of the concession on the part of members. It wasalso pointed out that the cost of a season ticket now was approximately equivalent to the cost of a return journey takenonce a week over the period of the season ticket.The President of the Board of Trade said that he had alreadybeen negotiating with the Railway Executive on the lines suggestedby the Prime Minister, but the railway companies refused to givethe passes for less than the price of the ordinary season ticket. a difficulty also arose from the fact that some members, in travellingto their constituencies, would have to travel over more than onerailway system, and he had failed to reach agreement with the &apos;companies to provide for such a contingency. Further, the position was complicated by the size of the constituencies of certain members, who might have to address a meeting in one part of the constituency in the morning, and be present at a function in adistant part of the constituency later in the same day. Was it proposed that a member should be allowed free travel insidehis constituency in cases of that kind ? There was also thequestion of alternative routes one part of a constituency might be served by one railway company and another part by a secondrailway company. Even if, as had been suggested, a rnember&apos;spass should be available from London to the main town of his constituency, there were often occasions when he had to visit partsof his constituency several miles away from this town, and when itwould be most inconvenient for him to travel first to this town inorder to obtain the full benefit of the concession. These were difficult points, upon which his negotiations with the railway executive had broken down. He thought that the voucher system would be much more acceptable than the system of a free pass tothe member with a constituency covering a wide area.After some further discussion, in the course of which it wassuggested, as a possible solution, that each member should be granted a book of passes with his name and constituency printed on eachpass, the member to fill up the&apos; name of the station to which he wished to travel on a particular occasion, the War Cabinet decided-(a.) To approve the principle-that the travelling expenses of-Members of Parliament who had taken the Oath, journey-ing between London and their constituencies, should becharged to the State.
2, Whitehall Gardens, 8.W.1,August 1, 1919.(6.) That the President of the Board of Trade should consultMembers of Parliament of all parties, and should then,in the light of the above discussion, negotiate with therailway companies the terms upon which they would beprepared to grant members the facilities desired.
