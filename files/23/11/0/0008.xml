The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidBrussels. that he desired the consent of the War Cabinet to raise the status of the British Legation at Brussels to that of an Embassy. TheBelgian Government had been pressing for this for some time,and he had. been in favour of such a change, but Mr. Balfour hadnot considered it desirable. The position now was that Franceand the United States had stepped in ahead of us and elevatedtheir Legations to Embassies. President Wilson had visitedBrussels and announced the change in person. It was probablethat Spain would follow the example of France and the UnitedStates, and Mr. Balfour had now agreed that it was desirable forthe British Government to conform.   Lord Curzon added that the[250]     4*&apos;&quot; B
2Chancellor of the Exchequer had sanctioned the increased expendi-ture such a change would involve.The War Cabinet agreed to the proposal of the ActingSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, that the BritishLegation in Brussels should be elevated to the status ofan Embassy.Internal Situation 2. With reference to War Cabinet 592, Minute 2, the Secre-in Bussia. tary of State for War said that, had he been present when theCabinet discussed the internal situation in Russia on Monday last,he could have given the Cabinet further information on thesubject. For instance, the reference to the treatment of Britishtroops was incorrect, and should have been &quot; British-trained &quot;troops. He would like the Cabinet to realise that the Govern-menfs decision to decline to treat with Lenin and Trotsky neces-sarily created a difficult position, and involved an alternative policy, for which the Cabinet was responsible.Mr. Barnes asked whether any credence was to be attachedto the despatch of Dr. Harold Williams in that morning&apos;s &quot; DailyChronicle,&quot; to the effect that Denekin was swiftly advancing intothe heart of Russia.The Secretary of State for War said that the War Office had warned Denekin of the condition of Admiral Kolchak&apos;s force, andof the danger of advancing too far, but Denekin had replied thathe knew of the dangers surrounding this force, but could notavoid his offensive. Denekin hoped by the 24th July to have takenSaratov, and anticipated that the capture of this place would puthim in touch with Kolchak. The latter hoped to resume the offensive by the 1st August. He had three divisions in reserve,and if even one of these divisions was capable of taking the offensive the retreat of Kolchak&apos;s force might be arrested; butthere was no doubt that the situation was critical. At the sametime he hoped the Cabinet would realise that practically the wholestrength of the Bolsheviks was directed against Denekin andKolchak, and if the forces of these two men were put out of action the Bolsheviks would have available some 600,000 men with which to spread their doctrines and ravages amongst smaller States,such as the Baltic Provinces, Czecho-Slovakia, and Roumania,with whose interests we were identified.Abolition of Con- 3. Mr. Barnes asked whether the Secretary of State for Warscription. could hold out any hope of making a statement that conscriptionwould soon be abolished.The Secretary of State for War replied that he proposed to,    , issue at once a statement to the press to the effect that all menwho had fought in the War would be out of the Army by next spring. He could not, however, at present say whether it wouldbe possible to demobilise the 80,000 boys who were recruitedrecently, but he had hopes of doing this. Should this not bepossible, he feared that a Conscription Act would be necessaryin order to retain them. Fie would like to add, for the Cabinefsinformation, that the War Office was recruiting 4,000 men everyweek for the Army, and that the previous week 2,000 men had signed on for seven years.Pay of the Navy 4- With reference to War Cabinet 593, Minute 2, the War&apos;Army, and Air Cabinet again considered the future rates of pay, allowances,Force.&apos; retired pay and half-pay for officers in the Navy, Army, and AirForce (Paper G.-252).
Mr. Bonar Law stated that the Board of Admiralty had considered the suggestion, thrown out at the previous meeting,that a certain proportion of the rates proposed should be regardedas a price bonus, to be varied according to the cost of living, andhe had now received a minute from the First Lord to the effectthat the Admiralty were prepared to agree that 20 per cent, ofthe new rates of pay should be considered as due to the present high cost of living, and should be subject, after five years, to change, either upwards or downwards, according as the cost ofliving rose or fell, the revision thereafter to take place, every threeyears, up or down, on the basis of the Board of Trade food prices. The Admiralty had agreed to this with the greatestreluctance, and had suggested that a general statement shouldbe made, somewhat to the following effect: In dealing with the emoluments of the Naval ratings, theGovernment decided that after the 31st December, 1919,the question of the future of Separation Allowancesshall be the subject of further consideration in the lightof the course of the cost of living.&apos; So, in fixing thenew rates of pay for Naval officers, it must be under-stood that 20 per cent, of the new scales of pay shall berecognised as due to the present high cost of living,&quot; andbe subject to increase or reduction, as the case may be,in accordance with fluctuations from time to time in thecost of living.The Secretary of State for War stated that, after considera-tion, the authorities at the War Office were prepared to agree toa statement such as the following being made in regard to theArmy: The grant of these rates is subject to the condition that theyare liable to revision at intervals of five years, inaccordance with the cost of living (and other conditions);but in no case will a rate of pay be reduced by more than20 per cent, of these rates.He was, however, prepared to accept the proposal put forward by the Admiralty. The case of the Air Force was entirely different, and under the proposed rates officers would be gettingless pay than they had received before the War, and it could not therefore be said that their pay was in any way due to the costof living. On the other hand, if during the next five years the flying risk diminished, that would be an argument for revising the rates of pay of the junior officers.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in the Air force the risks were mainly run by junior ranks. That was recognised in the rates of pay, but the pay of higher ranks where there were no such special risks closely approximated to the Army scale. if at the end of five years the risk was appreciably less, they could then reduce the pay of new entrants in the lower ranks. Thevariable 20 per cent., however, was quite apart from the extra paygiven for the risks of flying, and should apply to all ranks.The President of the Board of Education referred to thefollowing paragraph appearing in the Report of the Committee(Paper G.-252):-&quot; In assessing the emoluments of the Royal Air force the Committee have felt bound to take account of the risksattaching.to flying. It follows that if during the next fiveyears the progress of science should bring about a materialdiminution in flying risks, this circumstance should be takeninto consideration in the revision of the rates for futureentrants into the Air Force.&quot;The Secretary of State for War said that the Chief of the
Air Staff had offered three objections to the proposal to regard20 per cent, of the rates of pay as variable: (1.) If it were done for the officers and not for the men, thelatter would at once be encouraged to strike for morepay, as they would assume that the Government wereafraid of them and not of the officers.(2.) It was doubtful whether they would get sufficientofficers or men now at the rates of pay suggested forthe Air Force, and the added uncertainty of the pos-sible 20 per cent, decrease would undoubtedly mitigateagainst obtaining the men.(3.) Most of the officers in the Air Force would be on atemporary basis, and if their rates of pay were liableto be reduced by 20 per cent, it was very doubtful ifthey would obtain anything like a sufficient number.The Under-Secretary of State for Air said he would prefer that no possibility of a decrease in pay should be announced inthe case of the Air Force, but, if it were done at all, it was prefer-able that the decrease should be made dependent on the cost ofliving rather than on the flying risk.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that, as Mr. bonar law had stated, it was only with the greatest reluctance that theBoard of Admiralty had consented to the proposal. Their view was that the question of officers&apos; pay should be considered apart altogether from the cost of*living. Whether rightly or wrongly,before he went to the Admiralty, the information was conveyed to officers and men in the Navy that the long-standing injusticewhich they had suffered in regard to pay would be immediatelyredressed, and it was the general opinion that the pay of the navy would be considered on its own merits and not at all in relationto that for the Army and the Air Force. Anyone who knew Navalpay must recognise how different it was from the pay of the other two Services. In some cases the pay of Naval officers had notbeen reviewed since 1S16. As he had remarked on previous occasions, numbers of Naval officers were heavily in debt and werecounting upon the increases in pay to remove their burdens.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he presumed thenew rates of pensions, which the War Cabinet were also consider-ing, would be subject to the same condition as the rates of pay.In the case of the Civil Service he had given instructions to his department that retiring officers in receipt of pay and War Bonusshould have their pension assessed on the salary which they weredrawing, but that that part of the pension which was assessed onthe Bonus should be revised if and when the Bonus itself wasrevised. Actually, this instruction had been misunderstood, and what had happened was that a man who retired now had his pension for the rest of his life assessed on the pay and bonuswhich he was drawing on retirement. His own view was that aman retiring in 40 years&apos; time should not obtain a pension at separately which was fixed in relation to the cost of living to-day.Mr. Barnes drew attention to a question mentioned in theAdmiralty recommendations, which was not dealt with byMr. Fisher&apos;s Committee, namely, the question of making some provision for the widows of men who died on service. Thesewomen were in an entirely different position from that of the widows of officers, and he felt convinced that the Governmentwould, sooner or later, be met by a demand to treat the widows of both officers and men on the same basis, possibly on the linesof the Admiralty suggestion that provision should be made for both by means of some contributory scheme.The President of the Board of Education expressed hisgratification that the War Office and the Admiralty had acceptedthe principle that 20 per cent, of the pay and retired pay should
fluctuate with, prices. He had thrown out that suggestion in theCommittee when they were considering the rates of pay, but ithad not been well received, although he himself was firmly con-0 vinced that this was not the time to fix permanent rates of pay.He was being pressed to fix permanent rates for teachersthroughout the country, and the Cabinet decision that morningwould strengthen his hands in resisting this pressure.The Chancellor of the Exchequer desired to recognise grate-fully the manner in which the Service Departments had accepted,the War Cabinefs proposal. At the same time, he wished toplace, on record his own views as regards xthe general position.He had accepted the solution put forward by Mr. Bonar Lawbecause it was the only one which was acceptable to the Admiralty.His own opinion, however, was that the salaries proposed for the younger officers, who had no family obligations, were higher thanit was necessary to pay in order to obtain the requisite number of candidates, and higher than was good for those officers to receive.He regarded the rates of pay proposed for older officers as beinggenerally reasonable, though that of Admirals might perhaps havebeen subject to some deduction.Mr. Barnes drew attention to the proposal that, lieutenant-commanders in the Navy under the age of 40 should be allowedto retire voluntarily, at the discretion of the Admiralty, when thestate of the list permitted, and that such officers should be eligiblefor gratuities varying from 1,200Z. to 2,400Z., according to thelength of service. His own opinion was that officers should notbe allowed to retire under the age of 40 with such large sums ofmoney.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that there wasjustification for this, from the point of view of the Treasury, onaccount of the fact that the lists tended to become very over-crowded, and it would mean a considerable saving to the countryto allow the officers in question to retire than to retain them onhalf-pay.Mr. Bonar Law stated that the Prime Minister, having seen the Minutes of the previous meeting, had telephoned asking thatthe decision should be held up until his return, when he couldconsider what the proposals were likely to cost, and their relationto the Naval Estimates generally. He (Mr. Bonar Law) had asked the Prime Minister not to press the point, since the service departments had now agreed to&apos;the proposal for the variable20 per cent.(At this point Mr. Bonar Law left the room to telephone to thePrime Minister.)On returning, Mr. Bonar Law stated that he had given thePrime Minister an estimate of the cost of the proposals, and thelatter had now agreed to accept whatever the War cabinet decided.The War Cabinet decided that 20 per cent, of the rates of pay and retired pay for officersin the Navy, Army, and Air Force should be considered as due to the present high cost of living,&quot; and should besubject after five years to change, either upwards.ordownwards, according as the cost of living rose or fell,the revision thereafter to take place every three years,up or down, on the basis of the Board of Trade food prices index number.     - .&quot;Kept-on&quot; Officers ^ne First Lord of the Admiralty stated that there were still(%. Koyal Navy.     &apos;  two questions to be settled as regards the Navy.  In the first place,&apos; there was the question of the &quot; kept-on &quot; officer; that is to say,the officer whose time for compulsory retirement had come duringthe War but who had been retained in the Service. Officers whohad been retired before the War and were recalled to the Service[250] C
had been granted the pay of their rank plus 35 per cent., theirretired pay being suspended.    The Admiralty desired that thekept-on &quot; officer should be treated in the same way.The War Cabinet decided that Kept-on &quot; officers in the Royal Navy should receive the fullpay of their rank plus 25 per cent., retired pay beingsuspended during their period of continued service.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the second question was,the date from which the new rates of pay should take effect.It was absolutely essential that these rates should, in the case ofthe Navy, be antedated to the 1st February, the date from whichthe increases in the men&quot;s pay were granted.The Secretary of State for War said that it would be an extraordinary thing to antedate the new rates for one of theServices and not for the other two. Such action would be regarded-as a stigma on the Army and the Air Force, or as a special favourto the Navy.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that there hadbeen no expansion amongst Naval officers during the War corn-parable to that which had occurred in the Army, where many veryyoung officers had received high promotion. Besides, certainadvances in pay had been granted to Army officers during theWar, while nothing had been done for the Navy in that direction.It would be very difficult for him to oppose the suggestion thatthe new rates for Naval officers should be granted from the same date as the new rates for men in the Navy, but the case of theArmy was different. Mr. Chamberlain added that, although theArmy had been reduced to about a quarter of its War size, thenumber of general officers had not been proportionately reduced,and we were now paying over 8OO,0O0Z. a year for general officers.The Secretary of State for War agreed with the Chancellorsremarks, but suggested that all Mr. Chamberlain had said pointed to the hard case of Army officers. The result of the great expan-sion of the Army during the War, and its equally great contrac-tion now, was that officers were dropping considerably in rankor were being retired; majors who had been in command of divisions during the War were now reverting to the command ofbattalions, with a consequent decrease in pay of hundreds of pounds a year. In order to reduce the number of general officers,he intended to propose to the War Cabinet at a future date specialretiring terms, which he hoped would be accepted.Mr. Bonar Law enquired whether, if the increases were ante-dated for officers in the Army, it would be necessary to antedatethe new rates of pay for the men also.The Secretary of State for War replied that this would notbe necessary, as the new rates for men were in some cases lessbeneficial than the old rates.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that there were agreat number of Naval officers, too, who, during the war, had held flag rank at, say, 1,5G0Z. a year, and would now revert totheir retired pay of, say, 40GZ. or 500Z. a year. The real argument,however,1 for antedating the increases in the Navy, as comparedwith the Army, was that during the War substantial increaseshad been made in the pay of both officers and men in the Army,so that they were enabled to live and maintain their familieswithout serious hardship. In the Navy, on the other hand, therewere innumerable cases of officers who had had to do withoutservants and spend the whole of their savings in order to keep outof debt, and even then had not succeeded. In spite of this, theofficers and men had remained perfectly loyal, and had made nomovement until the Armistice was signed; then, however, they had asked that something should be done for them. The matter had come to a head at Christmas, when men in the Grand Fleet, on
taking their first leave for four years, had in many cases had toreturn to their ships before the expiration of their leave as thevcould not afford to remain at home. As a result of the discontentthat was aroused, the Commander-in-Chief had appointed two committees in the Grand Fleet to go into the question, and these committees had both advised that, in view of the serious financialcondition of both officers and men, any increases to he given shouldbe antedated the 1st October,. 1918. He (Mr. Long) had appointed two other Committees, who had taken a great deal off first-hand evidence and had gone carefully through the proposalsof the Grand Fleet Committees, and had greatly cut down some ofthe proposals. As a result of their recommendations, theAdmiralty proposed antedating the new rates to the 1st February.They felt, however, that that was the limit to which they could go,and that it was vital, for the sake both of the officers and the menof the Navy, that the War Cabinet should accept this date.The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained to the WarCabinet the amount of money which was involved in the questionof antedating the increases. In the case of the Navy, thedifference between the proposed future normal cost and the costthis year amounted roughly to 690,000/., of which 490,000/. was due to temporary and demobilisable officers. In the case of theArmy, estimating on an average strength of 60,000 officers forthe year, the difference between the proposed future normal costand the cost this year would be about 16,000,000/.The Secretary of State for War stated that, as under the new proposals some officers would be getting less pay than at present,he would not press that the new rates for the Army should beantedated to the 1st February.The War Cabinet decided that The new rates of pay and half-pay should take effect asfollows: (a.) For the Navy, from the 1st February, 1919.(b.) For the Army, from the 1st July, 1919.The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that he would liketo take that opportunity of pressing the Service Departments to speed up the demobilisation of officers. There were millions of pounds involved, and he did not think officers should be retainedany longer than was necessary.The Secretary of State for War pointed out that there werenumerous duties to be performed in France and Flanders, which necessitated the presence of officers there, and the same was thecase in other countries, such as the Baltic States and Boumania,where we had Military Missions. He would like to assure theChancellor of the Exchequer, however, that it was not the intentionof the War Office to retain any officer who was not performingdefinite important public work. Fie was announcing to the press that day that the War Office hoped to demobilise a further 600,000officers and men by the end of the year. . .The First Lord of the Admiralty stated that he wished theWar Cabinet to know that the Naval officers who had gone intothe question of pay with himself at the Admiralty hadcontinuously had in mind, and had often remarked to him uponthe necessity of bearing in mind, the enormous burden of taxationlaid upon the country, and the great demands which the treasury had to meet. -They had examined the pay of the officers fromthis point of view, and had cut down the proposals of the Jerramand Halsey Committees wherever they could.Lord Curzon suggested thati one direction in which the WarOffice migfit effect economies was in the number of officersattached to Military Missions. When he had seen GeneralGough, just before the departure of the latter for Helsingfors, hehad been given to understand that the number of officers attachedto his Staff would be three or four.     The number that actually
British  Troops  inIndia.went with General Gough was in the neighbourhood of twenty.He could quite understand the desire on the part of the heads ofthese Missions to have around them men in whom they hadconfidence, but he thought there was a tendency to take far moreofficers than were actually required.The Secretary of State for War pointed out that GeneralGough&apos;s duties embraced Helsingfors, Libau and Reval, to mention only a few places. He was performing very good work,and.a fairly large Staff was necessary.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, said that the British troopsin India would, of course, have their rates of pay changed inaccordance with the decision of the War Cabinet that morning.He was sorry the Secretary of State for India was unable to be present, but he presumed that officers and men retained in india would be paid by the Government of India at the new rates of pay.The War Cabinet concurred in Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s view.Mr. Barnes again referred to the anomaly in the treatmentaccorded to the widows of men and the widows of officers whodied other than in action or on duty, and said that the WarCabinet would, sooner or later, have to face the demand that officers and men should be placed on a similar footing in thisrespect.Subject to the decisions set out above, the War cabinet decided To approve the recommendations regarding the pay,allowances, retired pay and half-pay for officers of theNavy, Army and Air Force, set forth in Paper G.-252.Censorship.Post-war Pensions.5. With reference to War Cabinet 590, Minute 1, the WarCabinet had before them the opinion of the Law Officers of theCrown (Paper G.T.-7696) (Appendix) in regard to the powersof the Postmaster-General to compel, at the instance of a secretary of State, the submission to him, in certain circumstances,of all telegrams &quot;and cables received in or despatched from thiscountry.Mr. Bonar Law said that, in view of the opinion expressedby the Law Officers, it only remained for the War Cabinet to confirm their provisional decision, and to fix a date from whichthe abolition of the censorship should take effect.The First Lord of the Admiralty reminded the War Cabinetthat, at the last meeting when this question had been discussed,he had pressed in the strongest possible manner for the retentionof the powers now exercised. His Naval advisers still adhered to the view that the abolition of the censorship was most undesirable, as they regarded its retention of vital importance.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The censorship should be abolished as from midnightof the 23-24 July, 1919.(b.) The heads of the departments concerned should take thenecessary action to give effect to the above decision.(c.) The . subsequent   exercise of any emergency powersrequired  should be at the instance of the HomeSecretary.       .(The First Lord of the Admiralty desired that his dissent from this decision should be recorded in the Minutes ofthe Meeting.)6. The War Cabinet had under consideration a memorandumby the Minister of Pensions (Paper G-T.-7515), together with amemorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty (paper g.T.-7547).
WC 594The Minister of Pensions explained that he had now agreed with the First Lord of the Admiralty that the Ministry ofPensions   should   prepare  a  scheme for  post-war  disability(0 \ pensions in the Navy, and he hoped the War Office and AirMinistry would concur in a similar arrangement with regard tothe Army and Air Force respectively. He also desired theCabinet to approve (1.) That when the departments concerned had settled theretired pay and service pensions for officers and men,they should inform the Ministry of&apos; Pensionsaccordingly:(2.) That the scheme of pensions, &amp;c, should provide thatall officers and men discharged from service forwounds or disability should thereafter receive their pensions and gratuities solely from the Ministry ofPensions, notwithstanding that there was a serviceelement in the award:(3.) That any wound pension or gratuity to be given to anofficer or man intended to be retained in the service should be paid by the department in whose force hewas serving.Several months had elapsed since the matter had first been raised, and in any event it would probably be necessary to extend the existing&apos; Warrant until April 1920, when the Military service act expired. He doubted very much whether it would be possibleto put the post-war pensions upon a lower scale than the existingpensions. Certainly, so long as the fighting forces were all overthe world, they were liable to suffer disability, and it was very likely that they would claim that such disability arose out of this war.The First Lord and the Secretary of State for War concurred in the procedure now proposed by the Minister of Pensions.The Secretary of State for the Colonies suggested that existing rates should continue until April 1920, or any earlier date by which it was found possible to issue the new Warrant.Mr. Barnes said that the public understood that the end ofthe War would not be until the ratification of peace by all thePowers, and would expect pensions to be awarded at the present rates until then.The War Cabinet decided [a.) To approve the proposals of the Minister of Pensions:(b.) To authorise the continuance of the existing Warrantsuntil April 1920, or any earlier date,  after  the ratification of peace, by which it was possible to issue the new Warrant.7. The War Cabinet had under consideration a memorandumby the Minister of Pensions (Paper G.T.-7611) on the rates ofpensions to be received by men who had served in the ImperialArmy but were resident in the Dominions and United States.The Minister of Pensions stated that a very large numberof Canadian residents had enlisted in British regiments on theoutbreak of war, and many had done so in the United States.There were also reservists who rejoined. From these some 2,000to 4,000 pensioners would probably be created. The present systemof dealing with claims to pensions by disabled men and by widows and dependants who were resident in Canada and the UnitedStates was seriously defective in two respects: (1.) The existing arrangements of the Ministry did not secure them the same rights and advantages that weregiven to British pensioners or dependants resident inthis country:DBritish Pensionersin the Dominionsand the UnitedStatesofAmerica.[250]
(2.) The rates of pensions and allowances under the royal warrant were, for the most part, distinctly less favourable than those payable under the CanadianOrders in Council. Tor example, a British widowwould receive 16s. Qd., while a Canadian widow would receive 38s. 4*i., a disabled soldier from the ImperialArmy would receive 33s., while a Canadian soldierwould receive 4.7s. lid. -It was regarded as a scandal that ex-soldiers of the Imperial Armyliving side by side with ex-Canadian soldiers should be treated in this way. The Canadian Government had made representa-tions that it was the cause of much annoyance in Canada thatwidows of men who had gone out from Canada to enlist inEngland should be treated so much worse than the widows of menwho had joined the Canadian Army. In any circumstances, theMinistry of Pensions would have to provide some machinery fordealing with pensioners in Canada and the United States. Atpresent British consuls in the United States were attempting todo the work, but obviously had not the facilities. He proposedthat he should be authorised to enter into an agreement with theCanadian Government that, they should provide the necessary machinery, and that claimants to pensions in Canada and theUnited States should have the option of receiving the same pen-sions and allowances as were awarded to Canadians under theCanadian Orders in Council. His proposal was actually limitedto those who were resident in Canada or the United States before they joined the Army, but he suggested that the question of dis-abledmenVhb emigrated to Canada should also be considered, andhe.believed it might be wiser to extend the concession to them.: &quot;The&quot; Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the question wasone of extraordinary difficulty, and would open the way toapplications in respect of the other Overseas Dominions and theCrown ^oldnies., particularly South Africa, and possibly SouthAmerica. !&apos;..- -fTlie Minister of Pensions said that the rates of pensions inSouth Africa were practically the same as those in this country,tho^ghit1 Was not certain that they would remain so. He agreedth&apos;at his proposals would include Australia and New Zealand.the same considerations would not apply in the case of SouthAmerica, because it was only in one of His Majesty&apos;s dominions or Colonies that parallel cases would exist of soldiers receivinghigher rates of pensions than those existing in the Imperial Army.&quot;Mr. B6nar!Law said that he was a little alarmed at the effectof ther ^proposal &apos;on Labour, particularly in view of the fact thatthe Standard of living in America was now no higher than thatprevailing here. :;    &apos; -The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, if the proposal could be restricted to those who were resident in Canada or theUhited&apos; States hefore enlisting in the British Forces, : he thought there was a very strong case to be met, but he could not undertaketo extend the concession to every ex-soldier who left this countryto go to Canada or the United States.- The Under-Secretary of State for Air said he felt that therewas great force in the contention of the Minister of Pensions,that resentment would be caused if ex-soldiers of the ImperialArmy received a lower rate of pension than ex-soldiers in theCanadian&apos;Army resident in the same district, and he knew fromhis Experience when he was in command of a Canadian Brigadethat considerable feeling would he aroused.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) Pre-War British residents in Canada and the UnitedStates who enlisted in the Imperial Forces or Reservistswho rejoined from these countries should be allowed the option of taking pensions and allowances  and
medical treatment and training, and all other privi-leges, at the same rates and on the same terms as are provided by Canadian Orders in Council, in place ofthe rates of pensions, &amp;c, accorded under Royal&quot;Warrants:(&amp;.) The Canadian Pensions Adminstration (the Depart-ment of Civil Re-establishment) be asked to undertake the investigation of claims to pension and the medical examination of disabled men in accordance with theprinciple and practices of Canadian Orders in Councilrelating to pensions, and to award pension on behalfof the British Government, subject to confirmation by the Ministry of Pensions in each case. Provisionfor the necessary safeguards as to identification ofbeneficiaries required by the Appropriation Act; forthe preservation of the responsibility of the Ministerto Parliament; for the rendering of accounts by theCanadian authorities; and other details of thearrangement, to be agreed with the Treasury.(c,) Similar arrangements should  be sanctioned with otherself-governing Dominions.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,July 16, 1919.

Where, in the opinion of the Secretary of State an emergency has arisen inwhich it is expedient for the public service that the Government should have controlover the transmission of messages, by the Company&apos;s telegraphs, he may, undersection 52 of the Telegraph Act, 1863 (26 and 27 Vic, c. 112), by warrant (inter alia)direct and authorise such persons as he thinks lit to assume the control of the transmission of messages by any cable company&apos;s telegraphs, either wholly or partly,and in such manner as he directs. We think that this provision empowers him toassume control by requiring the Company to submit to a person or persons authorisedcopies of all messages received from abroad or despatched abroad by the Companyeither before or after transmission. No such Warrant has effect for a longer time than one week from the issuing thereof, but successive Warrants may be issued fromweek to week as long as, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, the emergencycontinues. The Company is entitled to compensation for any loss of profitsustained by reason of the exercise by the Secretary of State of any of his powers under the section, the amount, in default of agreement between the Secretary ofState and the Company, to be settled by arbitration.2. The power is limited to times when, in the opinion of the Secretary of State,an emergency has arisen in which it is expedient for the public service that theGovernment should have control over the transmission of messages by the Company&apos;stelegraphs.3. Yes, if in the opinion of the Secretary of State the periods in question oughtto be so regarded. In our opinion the discretion of the Secretary of State in thisrespect is absolute that is to say, that it could not be questioned in any court of law.4. Yes, we think so.
