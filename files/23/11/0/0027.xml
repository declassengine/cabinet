Land Settlement 1. The War Cabinet had before thern the Land Settlement(Scotland) Bill.        (Scotland) Bill, with a covering Memorandum by the Secretary forScotland (Paper G.T.-7902).The Lord Advocate, in reply to a question, stated that the Billgave effect to the Government policy, and only differed from theEnglish  Bill  in  matters  of machinery  consequent on  formerScottish land legislation.The War Cabinet gave their approval to the Bill.Policy in Eussia :Supplies toGeneral Denekin.2. The Chancellor of the Exchequer asked for the guidance ofthe Cabinet in regard to a request from the War Office that general denekin should be supplied with 4,000 additional mules. In thelight of the discussion which had taken place at the Cabinet on theprevious day (War Cabinet 612, Minute 2), he was inclined tocomply with the request, provided the necessarj7 shipping was available.The War Cabinet concurredthe Exchequer.in the view of the Chancellor of consideration of bills involvingCharges againstthe Treasury.3. In response to a request by the Chancellor of the Exchequer(Paper G.T.-7903), the War Cabinet agreed That no Bill involving a charge shall come up to the WarCabinet or Home Affairs Committee until the treasury have approved that charge, or, in the event of theTreasury having withheld sanction, until the minister responsible has expressed a desire to appeal.Dominion 4. The War Cabinet had before them the following documentsShipping.. dealing with Dominion shipping : Telegram from the Goveruor-General of Canada (paper g.T.-7965).Memorandum by Sir Robert Borden (Paper G.T.-7804).Note by Lord Milner (Paper G.T.-7850).Telegram from the Governor-General of Canada (paper g.T. 7956).The Secretary of State for the Colonies stated that there were two connected, but distinct, questions on which the views of theCabinet were desired. The first was the improvement of seacommunication between different parts of the Empire, the control ofocean freight rates, and the best disposition of available shipping.This was a matter which had been considered by the Imperial war conference, and had recently been pressed upon the attention ofMr. Lloyd George by the Prime Ministers of Canada and Australia.It had been agreed to set up a Committee to examine the matter,and some of the Dominions had already nominated their members.It was desirable that His Majesty&apos;s Government should nominatetheir representatives.The War Cabinet decided To leave the proposed nominations to be agreed by the Secretaryof State for the Colonies, the Shipping Controller, and thePresident of the Board of Trade, who should also draw upthe terms of reference to the Committee, such terms tobe shown to the Chancellor of the Exchequer before publication.
Exclusion of 0- The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theGermans from Secretary of State for the Colonies (Paper G.T.-7706) stating that,Colonies and at War Cabinet Meeting 559, Minute 3, it had been decided toProtectorates. suspend the draft despatch which had been prepared in the ColonialOffice inviting all colonies and protectorates to legislate withoutdelay with a view to prohibit Germans from entering, residing, ortrading locally in their territory for a period of five years from theend of the war, and to leave the matter in abeyance until the conclu-sion of peace. Peace with Germany having now been signed, it became necessary to consider what policy in the matter should befollowed. The reasons for a policy of exclusion had been set out ina former memorandum (Paper, G.T.-6563). Nothing had occurred since the Armistice to indicate that public opinion in the colonies and protectorates on the question had in any way altered. Localsentiment was very strong on the subject, and in Hong Kong the British community had threatened to. throw the Germans into the harbour if they returned. On the other hand, the reasons against apolicy of permanent exclusion were obvious, and as soon as German ywas admitted to the League of Nations it would, it was presumed, benecessary to give German nationals equal privileges with those ofother States.   The solution suggested by the Secretary of State forThe Secretary of State for the Colonies, continuing, said thesecond and most urgent matter was concerned with the dissatisfactionin Canada with regard to the action of our Ministry of Shipping, onwhich a number of very outspoken telegrams had been receivedfrom the Canadian Government. In view of the character of these telegrams, it had become absolutely necessary to send a consideredreply. The Canadians were in great difficulty with their own trade,and were unable to obtain ships for the conveyance, for example, ofcoal from Nova Scotia and Cape Breton to their own consumers.They also complained strongly that their trade with Europe wasbeing seriously hampered by our shipping policy. Lord Milnerthen read to the Cabinet a telegram received from the Governor-General of Canada dealing particularly with the case of thesteamship &quot; Bilbster,&quot; which had been requisitioned by theMinistry of Shipping to load a cargo of timber for Great Britain atthe very time when, it was alleged, a mixed cargo, including cattle and valued at about 2,500,000 dollars, was assembled at Montrealfor shipment to France by this vessel.The President of the Board of Trade said that the particular case of the &quot; Bilbster&quot; was creating a great public outcry in montreal, and demanded urgent attention.The Shipping Controller proceeded to deal in detail with thecase of the &quot; Bilbster,&quot; and characterised the telegram of theGovernor-General of Canada (dated the 9th August, 1919) as being-full of misstatements. The &quot;Bilbster&quot; was sold to a british company in April, 1919, and was still on the British register. The.present owners had purchased her with the full knowledge that shewas liable to be requisitioned, and that she would be completelyunder British control. The ship was perfectly designed to carrytimber, and the application for her was made as far back as the24th June last, and not, as stated, a week ago: It was thereforeknown, as far back as the 24th June, that the ship wrould not beavailable to carry cattle on the homeward voyage.Mr. Bonar Law stated that the matter was one involving somuch detail that it could not be satisfactorily discussed in a cabinet meeting.The War Cabinet decided To refer the matter for decision to Mr. Bonar Law, Lord Milner,and Sir Joseph Maclay, at a meeting to be held at11, Downing Street, on Friday next, the 15th August, at10-30 A.M.   v
the Colonies was that the colonies and protectorates should beinvited to pass legislation under which the local Government wouldhave a free hand in keeping out Germans, without laying down as a 1)principle that all Germans must be excluded. This might be attained by requiring any subject of a State lately at war with HisMajesty to have a permit, signed by the Colonial Secretary of thecolony or protectorate which he wished to enter, before he enteredsuch colony or protectorate. This legislation might be limited to a term of three years. There was nothing in the Treaty of Peacewhich prohibited such a solution. Lord Milner also proposed that asimilar policy should be applied to mandated territory of which thiscountry receives the mandate, and quoted article 122 of the Treatyof Peace in support of his proposal. The memorandum concluded by stating that the Dominions would of course follow their own policy in this matter, but whatever decision His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment reached should be communicated at once to the DominionGovernments.The War Cabinet had. also under consideration a memorandumby the President of the Board of Trade on the same subject (paper g.T.-7844), reminding them that such legislation as was proposedby the Secretary of State for the Colonies would only be free fromobjection if confined to persons who remained subjects of ex-enemy states ; that it would be obviously necessary to recognise any newly-acquired nationality ; and that it was not, therefore, possible to enact legislation which would enable all persons lately our enemiesto be excluded from our colonies and protectorates.The Secretary of State for the Colonies, in reply to a question by Mr. Bonar Law, said that he quite agreed with what had been pointed out by the President of the Board of Trade, and desired thathis proposals should be modified accordingly. If the War cabinet approved, he suggested that he should address a circular letter tothe several Dominion Governments stating the policy which HisMajesty&apos;s Government had decided to adopt in respect of the rightto exclude nationals of those countries which had lately been at warwith the British Empire. The Canadian government had already taken drastic steps to prohibit such nationals entering tiie Dominion,and he thought perhaps it was better that exclusion should berigorously enforced &apos; than that regrettable incidents should ocpur.His own proposals, however, left room for relaxation later.The War Cabinet decided To approve the proposals of the Secretary of State for theColonies, subject to such modification as might be necessaryin view of the point raised by the President of the Board ofTrade in his memorandum, in respect of both british colonies, protectorates, and such territories the mandate forwhich might be committed to Great Britain by the Leagueof Nations; and authorised him to inform the DominionGovernments of the policy decided upon by his Majesty&apos;sGovernment. -&apos;Titles for&quot; 6. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the canadians. Secretary of State for the Colonies (Paper G.T.-7S31) stating thatin March, 1918, the Governor-General of Canada had forwarded aReport of the Privy Council on the question of conferring titles of honour upon subjects of His Majesty ordinarily resident in Canada.The Pteport concluded by requesting that the necessary action mightbe taken to render effective the following proposals : (1.) No honour or titular distinction (saying those granted in recognition of military service during the present war,or ordinarily bestowed by the Sovereign proprio motu)shall be conferred upon the subjects of His Majestyordinarily resident in Canada except with the approvalor upon the advice of the Prime Minister of the Dominion.
(2.) The Government of the United Kingdom shall exercise the same authority as heretofore in determining thecharacter and number of titles or honours to be allocated to Canada from time to time.(3.) No hereditary title or honour shall hereafter be conferred upon a subject of His Majesty ordinarily resident inCanada.(4.) Appropriate action shall be taken, whether by legislation or otherwise to provide that, after a prescribed period,no title or honour held by a subject of His Majesty,now or hereafter ordinarily resident in Canada, shall berecognised as having hereditary effect.To the above Memorandum was annexed a copy of an address to the King from the House of Commons of Canada, asking forHis Majesty&apos;s approval of the above proposals. The Secretary ofState for the Colonies, in his Paper before the Cabinet, proposed,with His Majesty&apos;s concurrence, to reply that the Addresshad been laid before the King, who was pleased to receive it verygraciously ; that he would take it into his consideration, and would,.in due course, intimate his pleasure with regard to the subjects ofwhich it treats. As regards the first part of the Address, hethought that the assurance contained in Mr. Long&apos;s despatch of the9th August, 1918, should have been accepted as sufficiently meetingthe wish of the Canadian Government, and he did not think thatwe should go further. As regards paragraph (b), asking the king to take action, by legislation or otherwise, in regard to HisMajesty&apos;s prerogative, he thought it would be useless and imposed-operto ask the Imperial Parliament to pass an Act.for such a purpose.As the matter touched the privileges of the House of Lords, hethought it would be well, if the Lord Chancellor concurred, to refer it to the Committee of Privileges, and also to obtain the opinion ofthe Law Officers of the Crown.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he thought that lord Milners proposals were very sound, and presented a reasonable solution.Mr. Bonar Law enquired whether there was any particularneed for hurry, and whether anything more recent had been received on the subject from Canada.The Secretary of State for the Colonies replied that he did not contemplate any immediate answer, but thought that the WarCabinet ought to know of the representations that had been made.bythe Canadian Government. If the War Cabinet so desired, he was prepared to leave the matter alone for the present. He thought,however, it would be desirable to consult the Law ; Officers inregard to the latter part of the Address.After a brief discussion, the War Cabinet decided : (a.) To approve (subject to His Majesty&apos;s concurrence) theSecretary of State for the Colonies&apos; proposed reply, thatthe Address had been laid before the King, who waspleased to receive it very graciously, that His Majestywould take it into consideration.(6.) That the Secretary of State for the Colonies should beempowered to consult the Law Officers of the Crown inregard to the question&apos; raised in the second part of the address.Termination of thePresent War(Definition) Act,1918.7. The War Cabinet took note of a Memorandum by theFirst Commissioner of Works (Paper G.T.-7913) on the Terminationof the Present War (Definition) Act, 1918.   (Appendix.)
8. With, reference to War Cabinet 577, Minute 2, the WarCabinet had under consideration a Memorandum by the Minister ofLabour in regard to the emplojunent of disabled and demobilisedmen in Government Offices (Paper G.T.-7869), circulating copies ofthe Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee appointed toconsider, under Sir Malcolm Ramsay&apos;s chairmanship, the cpiestionof providing employment in Government Offices for disabled ex-Service men of all ranks, including officers.The Minister of Labour said that an urgent decision of the WarCabinet was required in regard to this question. representations were constantly being made to him by disabled officers and men,who were in a very discontented state. , He drew particular attentionto the fact that Sir Malcolm Ramsay&apos;s Committee had found that notless than 21,000 Government posts were occupied by women, manyof whom did not depend absolutely on their wages for their livelihood.The Committee estimated that, if their recommendations were actedupon, these posts would be liberated within six months from thedate upon which the process of substitution began.Briefly, the Committee recommended that (a.) During the period of three months from the date on whichinstructions on the Report are issued to disabled men,should be substituted in each Department (except on certain reserved occupations) a number representing not- less than 8- per cent, of the temporary staff, male and female, employed in the Department on the 30th June, 1919,irrespective of any reductions effected since that date.(b.) All future vacancies and temporary posts to be filled bydisabled men ; failing disabled men, demobilised men should be substituted or engaged, as far as qualifiedcandidates can be made available.(c.) The position to be reviewed on the 31st March, 1920.Mr, Barnes confirmed what had been said by the Minister ofLabour about the very strong feeling that existed generally inrespect to the continued employment of young women, when so many disabled officers and men were unemployed.Mr. Bonar Law enquired whether, in the event of the WarCabinet approving the Committee&apos;s -proposals, the officers would accept the employment offered. In any case, in giving effect to therecommendations of the Committee, much would depend upon the heads of: the various Departments concerned.The Minister of Labour pointed out that the recommendationsof the Committee made no mention of what had already been done.No less than .19,000 temporary or permanent posts were alreadyfilled by disabled men. He would like to be authorised by theCabinet to make an announcement to the House of Commons, beforethe Recess, stating what had been done and what it was proposed todo in regard to the employment&apos; of disabled men and officers.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he agreed with theMinister of Labour&apos;s proposals, but he hoped that, in making his announcement, he would utter a word of caution against exaggeratedhopes being entertained. There might be some difficulty incarrying out the proposals in very small departments.The War Cabinet decided (a.) To approve the proposals of Sir Malcolm Ramsay&apos;s Com-mittee, as set forth in the Memorandum of the Ministerof Labour.(b.) To authorise the Minister of Labour to make an announce-ment in the House of Commons, before the Recess, ofthe steps that had been taken by his Department toprovide employment for disabled officers and men, andof the lines upon which he proposed to proceed in regardto providing further employment.[employment ofDisabled andDemobilised Menin government offices.
7WG 613(c.) THe date of the above announcement to be arranged by theMinister of Labour, in consultation with the Leader ofthe House of Commons.9. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by thePresident of the&apos; Board of Trade regarding the position of the non-ferrous industry in the United Kingdom (Paper G.T.-7829).The President of the Board of Trade said that, in a previous memorandum on this subject (Paper G.T.-7364), which had beenconsidered by the Home Affairs Committee, he recommended that (1.) There should be an immediate enquiry into the whole position of the non-ferrous mining industry in theUnited Kingdom, with a view to deciding whether theindustry can be placed in a satisfactory commercialposition.(2.) In the meantime, in order to enable mining operations tocontinue, His Majesty&apos;s Government should undertaketo make advances to approved mines up to somethingless than the breaking-up value of their plant and machinery as established by an independent valuation,such loans to bear interest and be repayable in a shortterm of years.The Home Affairs Committee had approved these proposals,subject, in the case of the second, to the condition that the accept-ance of the advances should be at the market rates, and that thedetails of any particular scheme should be submitted to theTreasury for their examination and approval. Sir Auckland Geddessaid that the mines in Cornwall did not pay, and there was nodoubt that they had been managed inefficiently, owing to insufficientscientific investigation, but the position in the mining centres was almost entirely dependent on this industry. The Government were therefore faced with the situation that the mines were in debt, and unless something was done to help them keep going for the nestfew months there would be a large number of people out of work.A Committee was already at work investigating as to whether therewras any possibility of an industry of this sort existing in thiscountry. He suggested that advances should be paid to this industry, on the condition that mining operations were continued,until such time as the Committee reported. He thought a sum of75,000Z. would be sufficient for this purpose.In reply to a question by the Chancellor of the Exchequer asto when the present donation scheme ceased, the Minister of Labourreplied that it came to an end on the 21st November of this year, sofar as civilians were concerned, but that this did not apply to the policies issued to discharged members of His Majesty&apos;s forces.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he did not like making such an advance as was suggested by the President of the Boardof Trade, and the only excuse was to say the industry would be assisted by the State until the Report of the Committee was available. At the present moment there was a universal cry fromeveryone for the State to help them, although at the same time thegreatest objections were put forward by these same people to Statecontrol.The War Cabinet decided that The non-ferrous mining industry should receive State assistance on the lines suggested by the President of the Board ofTrade in his Memorandum (Paper G.T.-7829) to the extentof a sum not exceeding 75,O0OL ; but that such assistance should only be made until the Report of the Committeeenquiring into the future of this industry was received.[599]D
, 10. The War Cabinet had before&apos; them the following memoranda.regarding the future of the Liquor Trade :  -Draft Report of the Liquor Restrictions Committee (paper g.-246).Memorandum on the Sale of Intoxicants Bill (Paper G.-245).Memorandum by the Chairman of the Liquor Control Board(Paper G.T.-7822). .     !Memorandum by the Chairman of the Home Affairs Committee(Paper G.T.-7703)Memorandum by the Food Controller (Paper G.T.-7734).The President of the Board of Education said that all he required at the moment was two decisions by the Cabinet: 1. Whether they would approve on general lines the Sale of.     Intoxicants Bill (Paper G.-245) in order that this bill could be introduced in the Autumn Session ; and2. Whether the Liquor Control Board pould be instructed tocontinue   their   present  restrictions   until   the  new.. Commission, set up in the above Bill, was established.He would also like to make an announcement in the Housewith regard to (2). Mr. Fisher said that the Draft Bill was inan imperfect state, but that, if the Cabinet would accept it inprinciple, he would be able to work at it during the recess.Mr. Fisher added that the Bill did not prejudice the question ofState purchase or the system of local option.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he hoped thePresident of the Board of Education would consult with the Boardof Customs and Excise in regard to Clause 4 of the Bill.The War Cabinet decided (a.) To approve in principle the Sale of Intoxicants Bill:(h.) That the President of the Board of Education should beauthorised to state in the House, on the last day of the session, by means of Question and Answer, that theGovernment had instructed the Liquor Control Board totake no action which might prejudice the position of thenew authority which the Government proposed to set up; under the Sale of Intoxicants Bill.2, Whitehall Gardens, 3.W. 1.,Axiqust 13, 1919.
APPENDIX.G.T.-7913. .     :-Termination of the Present War (Definition) Act, 1918.Memorandum by the First Commissioner of Works.IN connection with the Declaration to be made by His Majesty in Council underthe provisions of this Act, as to the date which is to be treated as the date of thetermination of the present war, it appears that, in so far as any latitude is allowed tothe Government in settling this date, the various Government Departments whose work is affected by the Act may, owing to the different contractual obligations into whichthey have entered, have different wishes as to whether the date or dates declared inaccordance with Section I (1) or I (3) be early or late.2. It is presumed that before the date is definitely fixed this question &quot;will beconsidered by the War Cabinet, and that it is within the power of the Government to defer fixing the date until the ratification of the last Treaty is arranged. The con-siderations determining the Governments decision will, doubtless, be varied, and somemay be of such outstanding importance as to override others, but in so far as latitudeis possible and the contractual obligations of this Department in regard to accommo-dation maybe taken into account, the First Commissioner desires to emphasise thefact that the later the dates in question may be the greater will be the alleviationwhich will be afforded to this Department in overcoming the difficulties attendant onthe solution of accommodation questions. In addition to the fact that numerous tenantsremoved from requisitioned accommodation hold tenancies expiring several monthsafter the termination of the war, a considerable number of the premises hired by thisDepartment since the outbreak of hostilities are held on agreements terminating shortly after the end of the war, and as the reduction of the numbers of official staffs is coh-siderably less than the estimates (given formally and informally from time to time bythe various Departments) upon which this Departments schemes have been based, thedifficulties in the way of releasing important premises affected by the fixing of this dateor dates are thereby accentuated.3. The First Commissioner hopes that as far as possible effect may be given tothese considerations.(Signed) ALFRED MOND.His Majesty&apos;s Office of Works,August 5, 1919.An Act to make provision for determining the Date of the Termination of thePresent War, and for purposes connected therewith.[21st November, 1918.]Be it enacted by the King&apos;s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows : 1. -(1.) His Majesty in Council may declare what date is to be treated as the dateof the termination of the present war, and the present war shall be treated as havingcontinued to, and as having ended on, that date for the purposes of any provision in any act of Parliament, Order in Council, or Proclamation, and, except where the context otherwise requires, of any provision in any contract, deed, or other instrumentreferring, expressly or impliedly, and in whatever form of words, to the present war orthe present hostilities:Provided that in the case of any such Act conferring powers on any GovernmentDepartment, or any officer of any Government Department, exercisable during thecontinuance of the present war, if it appears to His Majesty that it is expedient that
the powers shall cease before the date so fixed as aforesaid, His Majesty in Council mayfix some earlier date for the termination of those powers.(2.) The date so declared shall be as nearly as may be the date of the exchange ordeposit of ratifications of the treaty or treaties of peace :Provided that, notwithstanding anything in this provision, the date declared as-aforesaid shall be conclusive for all purposes of this Act.(3.) His Majesty in Council may also similarly declare what date is to be treatedas the date of the termination of war between His Majesty and any particular State.2. This Act may be cited as the Termination of the Present War (Definition)&apos;Act, 1918.o
