Printed for the War Cabinet.   July 1919.SECRET.h J sWAR CABINET 595.Minutes of a Meeting of the War Cabinet held at 10, Downing Street, S.W., onFriday, July 18, 1919, at 1P30 a.m.Present :The Right Hon. A. Bonar Law, M.P. (in the Chair).The Right Hon. the  Earl  Curzon  of J The Right Hon. G. N. Barnes, M.P.Kedlbston, K.G., G.C.S.I., G.C.I.E.The Right Hon. A.

Mr. Bonar Law reminded the War Cabinet that, on theIncreased Price previous Monday, he had made an offer to the miners to the effectof Coal. that the Government would postpone the addition of the extra 6s.per ton on the price of coal for three months if the miners&apos; repre-sentatives would give a pledge that, during that period, there shouldbe no stoppages or strikes and that they would do all in their powerto increase the output of coal. The matter had been discussed bythe Miners&apos; Federation on the previous day, and, in effect, the offer of the Government had been refused. He desired therefore theopinion of his colleagues as to whether he should announce in theHouse of Commons that morning the decision of the Government toincrease the price of coal as from the following Monday. He had tried to speak to the Prime Minister on the matter that morning,but the latter had already started for London. His own belief wasthat it would be a mistake not to make the announcementimmediately.Mr. Barnes suggested that the Prime Minister might have something to say on the question. -Mr, Bonar Law said that he recognised this, and for that reasonhe had tried to get through to the Prime Minister on the telephonethat morning. In any case, the Prime Minister had been quitedecided on the question of putting the increased price on to theconsumer. The only alternative appeared to be that the Board ofTrade should prepare the necessary Order, but that the issue of thepress notice should be delayed until after the Prime Ministers returnthat evening.The Chancellor of the Exchequer expressed the opinion that[269]
any&apos; delay in making the announcement  would be regarded asweakness, and would be unwise in the broadest political sense.The War Cabinet decided that Mr. Bonar Law should make the announcement regarding theincreased price of coal in the House of Commons that afternoon.Diplomatic 2. The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said thatKepresentation at Great Britain had not had a diplomatic representative at the Vaticanthe Vatican. for many years previous to the outbreak of war.   Towards the endof 1914, however, the Government had sent a special envoy (sir henry Howard) to the Pope, in order to explain the objects withwhich Great Britain had entered the war, the reasons for the continuation of the war, and to conciliate, as far as possible, Catholicopinion throughout the world. After some time, Sir Henry Howardhad been replaced by Count de Salis. The duties had been quiteefficiently performed, but there was no proof that we had gainedconsiderably diplomatically, although certain good results hadaccrued. It was necessary to decide whether, after the conclusionof the war, we should continue to have a diplomatic representativethere. Even during the war the appointment had been severelyB i criticised by Protestants, and the Foreign Office held the view that,if it was continued at all, the representative should be a Protestantrather than a Catholic. The Department did not press for arepresentative, and he (Lord Curzon) was opposed to the idea, partly because he did not think there was sufficient justification for it, andpartly because the appointment would raise a storm in Parliament.The Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs concurred in his view. Lord Curzon added that,-with Mr. Balf&apos;our&apos;s authority, hehad been surveying the field of our diplomatic representation. Thewhole question of future appointments was being reviewed, and he had brought the question of representation at the Vatican to the WarCabinet that day (1) because the Foreign Office were being pressed to make an announcement on the subject immediately, and (2) inorder that, if the War Cabinet decided that a diplomatic repre-sentative was to be sent to the A^atican, it could be fitted in withthe new appointments. It seemed to him quite clear, from the letterof appointment which was sent to Sir Henry&apos;Howard by Sir EdwardGrey, that it was intended to be a war appointment only.Mr. Bonar Law suggested that, if the Government announcedimmediately that representation would cease, it might be inter-preted as pandering to Sir Edward Carson and the Protestants.Lord Curzon pointed out that the House of Commons was pressing for a statement on the matter, and there was a motion downin Committee to reduce the Foreign Office Vote in order to call attention to the salary attaching to this appointment. The motion should have been taken two days before, but had been postponed,as it was impossible to obtain a quorum. It would, however, betaken the following week, and it was imperative that the Govern-ment should make a statement on this question without delay.Lord Curzon added that the French Government, although aCatholic (kwernment, had no representative at the Vatican.- The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought that it might beusefui i o have a representative who would convey the opinions ofthe Government to the Pope.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that there wouldbe certain advantages if we had some direct method of bargainingwith the Catholic Church.Lord Curzon pointed out that the question should be considered from the point of view of the diplomatic advantages that might beexpected to accrue.   Although we now had a representative at the     OVatican   for five years we had gained very little.    Replying toa suggestion by Mr., Bonar Law, that it should be stated that the
3 * WC595Government could not announce a decision until the war was over,Lord Curzon pointed out that in Committee the. following week theGovernment would be pressed to state what their policy was to beonce &quot;ratifications had been exchanged. Before the war, France andGermany, as well as ourselves, had had no representatives at the vatican, while Austria and Spain had had representatives there.It would be a sharp departure from our pre-war policy for us to have arepresentative at the Vatican when the war was over.The War Cabinet decided that Subject to the Prime Ministers approval, we should, after the ratification of Peace, revert to our pre-war policy of having no diplomatic representative at the Vatican.Unalienated Landsin SouthernEhodesia.3. With reference to War Cabinet 592, Minute 4, the WarCabinet took note of a Memorandum by the Secretary of State forthe Colonies (Paper G.T.-7703), in which he stated that he hadconferred with the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the question ofcompensation due to the British South African Company, and thatthe opinion of the Lord Chancellor had been obtained on the point at issue. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, after&quot; reading theopinion of the Lord Chancellor, had concurred in the proposed Termsof Reference for the Commission. The opinion of the LordChancellor was as follows : -&quot; It is difficult to deal with this question as a matterof law. Dealing with it as a practical matter of business,it would appear that interest would naturally be payable.The power of the Crown indefinitely to postpone the date atwhich they will take over the administration, and become liableto reimburse the Company for their previous expenditure,would in effect frustrate the judgment, if interest, on that expenditure is not paid at the time of reimbursement. . LordDunedin in the course of argument three times stated the proposition to be reimbursement with interest, and the Solicitor-General in his reply took no objection to this statement ofprinciple.&quot; If the matter is to be dealt with as one of law it is to be observed that Lord Sumner states the principle upon whichthe Court bases the right to reimbursement as arising from thelegal incidents which both by the Common Law and the CivilLaw attach to the relationship existing between the Crown andthe Company. It appears, so far as the Civil Law is concerned,that that relationship would have carried the right to interestwith the right to reimbursement. So far as the Common Lawis concerned, the judgment has in effect found that the Companydid this work as agent for the Crown. , An agent in such circumstances is, as the Board has found, entitled to be reimbursed the moneys which he has properly expended. I can see no reason why he should not he paid the interest whichwould have been the fruit of his capital if otherwise employed.&quot;Application of the whitley Eeport tothe administrative and LegalDepartments ofthe Civil Service.4. With reference to War Cabinet 579, Minute 3 The War Cabinet took note of a Memorandum by the Treasury(Paper G.-256) giving a list of 26 out of 27 Civil Servantswho it was proposed should be official members of theNational Council.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,July 18, 1919.o
