2Distribution  of......    1. The War Cabinet had under consideration a memorandumWar Medals. by gir Frederick Ponsonby on the distribution of war medals(Paper G.T.-7686), in which it was stated that an Inter-Departmental Committee, of which&apos; he was Chairman, had putforward a scheme that there should be two War Medals, theBritish War Medal and the Victory Medal, and that the formershould be given to every gazetted officer and enlisted man in thethree Services, irrespective of where he had served; while the victory Medal should be restricted to men in the Navy who hadbeen afloat, and men in the Army who had entered a theatre ofwar. It was further stated that a medal for all war-workers hadbeen considered, and found to be impossible. It was recommendedthat there should be a medal for the Mercantile Marine.The Secretary of State for War said that the original proposal had been to give a War Medal to everybody who woreuniform, and to nobody else. Prom an administrative point ofview that was very convenient, but from any other point of view it produced absurdities in every direction, and would be impossibleto defend in Parliament. It involved giving War Medals to some,000,000 men who had never left this country, and were, for themost part C3 men the least fit men, mentally and physically, ofall the men in the Army, - being neither skilful enough formunition work nor strong enough to go to the Front. They had,no doubt, done their duty, but to extend the War Medal to menwho never went to the War would lower the value of the WarMedal in the eyes of all who received it. The fighting troops were very jealous of their rewards, and would greatly resent it.Moreover, once it was decided to give a reward for service athome, the different classes of war-workers must be judged ontheir merits. The proposal of the Committee singled out one class only of those who had stayed at home. Lord Kitchener had promised a medal to the munition workers, whose work was certainly of much greater value that the garrison duty performed by C3 men. The Government were obliged to break thatpromise, as it had not been found possible to devise a scheme tocarry it out; but if it was proposed to appraise the value ofservice at home, it. was absurd to select C3 men for reward. Itwas only necessary to consider the work which had been done in air raids by the police, by firemen, and special constables, or, onthe other hand, the dangerous duty undertaken by the workers in :filling factories, who were always liable to the risk of explosions,by those engaged in the manufacture of poison gas, or by thewomen in Woolwich Arsenal, who continued on night shiftsduring air raids. He had discussed the matter with the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff, who had agreed that it was impossibleto award the British War Medal to men who had not gone to theWar. He proposed that the British War Medal should be givento everybody who went abroad, and to nobody else, and the ArmyCouncil were strongly of that opinion.Some discussion took place as to whether the proposed scheme had not already been published in the press in the form of state-,  ments by representatives of the Dominions, or in questions in theHouse of Commons.The Secretary of State for War continued that he was quite sure that. the Government were not committed officially. TheFirst. Lord of the Admiralty had pointed out to him that theproposal to restrict the issue of the medal to those who wentabroad.would not cover the needs of the Navy, as, for example,the case of depot ships; nor would it extend to the merchant service. He- felt, however, that that need raise no difficulty, andwas capable of adjustment. The value of a medal necessarilyarose from some sort of association with danger. As he had told the First Lord, identical regulations were not essential as betweenthe two Services, in which the conditions were necessarilydifferent, provided that similar treatment was acorded in parallel
cases. He suggested that there should be two separate sets ofrules for the Army and the Navy. He was confident that he could agree with the First Lord in the matter, and had not intended to trouble the Cabinet.Mr. Bonar Law pointed out that the Dominions had agreedto give the War Medal to troops who had not left their own country, and it seemed to him important to secure uniformity inthe matter throughout the Empire. He thought it would be agreat advantage in the future that the medal should be given onthe same basis throughout the whole of the Empire. He suggestedthat Mr. Churchill&apos;s objections would be met by the issue of the victory Medal, which would be given only to tlie troops who hadbeen in the theatre of war, and by awarding some kind ofdistinction to home war-workers. It was not at all out of place to issue a medal to those who had worn uniform. It would be veryhard that men who had served for three years or more, and had inmany cases pressed their claims to be sent to the Front, shouldreceive no recognition. He suggested that the matter should bereferred back to the Committee for reconsideration.The Secretary of State for War said that he had no objectionto the Dominions doing as they liked in their own countries, buthe could see no advantage in securing uniformity throughout theEmpire if it could only be attained by glaring anomalies in thiscountry. He agreed that there was a strong case for issuing somedistinction to war-workers at home, but there was great difficultyin appraising the value of services rendered, and in getting exactregisters. He was not prepared to reject the proposal, but would first proceed with the War Medal for the troops who had goneabroad. Anomalies could not be avoided, but there Was not alarge number of fit men who had not been abroad at some time or another during the War. The unfit men had received their pay,pensions, and gratuity, and he did not see that they had any reason to complain; nor did he think they would. In the SouthAfrican War the War Medal had been awarded to a few battalionswho had done garrison duty at Gibraltar, but it had not beenissued for home service; nor had that been done in any other war,so far as he was aware.Sir Frederick Ponsonby stated that the reasons which had led the Committee to their decision to grant a medal to all menwho had worn uniform were: 1. That in many cases men serving in France had done thesame duty as, and bad been attended by no greaterrisk than, men serving at home;2. That London must be regarded, for practical purposes, asthe headquarters of the world-war;3. That when a man joined the Army he was under orders,and had no choice in determining where he was toserve;4. That it was not possible, in practice, to distinguish between those who had been under shell-fire and those who hadnot, and that therefore every man who entered a theatre of war would get two medals. If men whohad not been under fire received two medalSj it wouldseem only fair that those at home should get one.He pointed out, on the other hand, that if a medal forwar-work at home were given only to those who wore uniform,great anomalies were inevitable. Dockers would receive a medalfor wheeling beer-barrels across a wharf; women waitresses inofficers&apos; messes would receive it because they were in uniform,while munition workers, Y.M.C.A. workers and Red Cross workers at home would not be eligible. The Dominions had been consultedat every stage, and it would be necessary to telegraph to them thatthe matter was being reconsidered, so far as it applied to thiscountry, and to invite their views. We could restrict the issue ofthe medal, in the case of our own men, to those who had goneabroad.
The Under-Secretary of State for Air said that, in hisopinion, there would be great discontent if the medal were givento the men who had stayed at home. The issue of a medal to menwho had done garrison duty in Malta during the South AfricanWar had^in his recollection, caused considerable resentment. Theproposal in the Air Force was to issue the medal to anybody wholeft the ground to engage the enemy. That would include the squadrons who were kept in England for the purpose of defeatingair raids. It was quite true that skilful pilots had been kept athome for training purposes and for testing machines, but it was proposed to give them some other kind of reward.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he did not agreethat it was necessary to have precisely the same basis for issuingthe, medal in the Army and the Navy. The circumstances werenot the same, and he thought that an arrangement could easily be made by agreement with the War Office. In any event, there could not be greater dissatisfaction than existed at present.Rewards had been showered on some men, while others had receivednothing at all. Hundreds of men had gone to France, and had remained in Paris, where they had lived in great comfort. It wasimpossible to avoid anomalies of that kind. He was quite preparedto confer with the Secretary of State for War, and arrive at anagreement without troubling the Cabinet.Mr. Bonar Law said that he would be prepared to agree toleave the matter to the Admiralty and the War Office, but for thefact that the Dominion Governments had agreed to the scheme proposed by the Committee, and he feared the effect upon them ofdeparting from the Committee&apos;s decision.Sir Frederick Ponsonby suggested that the medal should beissued, in the first instance, only to those who had gone overseas,and might be extended on a larger scale later, the Dominions being consulted in the interval. If the Dominions objected to the restricted issue in this country, then it would be necessary toextend the scheme. The Australians were very keen about it, onthe ground that many men had been kept behind to train their troops, and were not allowed to go abroad.The Secretary of State for War objected to the suggestionthat an objection by one only of the Dominions should compel usto extend the scheme in a way which would produce irritation andanomalies in this country. He w*as quite in favour of issuing amedal for all war-work at home, if it could be done, but did not desire to press it.Mr. Barnes agreed that to give the medal to soldiers who had served only at home would bring them into marked contrast withother war-workers at home, and produce great ill-feeling.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that, in hisopinion, it was very hard to give no reward to the large numberof men who had volunteered in the early stages of the War, andhad not been &apos;allowed to go abroad. They had had four years of hard and disagreeable service, and would get nothing; while menwho had been conscripted during the last six months, and sent to light work in the Channel ports in France, would receive themedal. In his opinion, the fact that the medal would be issued to men in France who had not been exposed to danger would eventually force the hand of the Government and oblige them toextend it to all men who had been in the Army. He suggested thatthe medal should be given, in the first instance, to men who had served abroad, and that the Government should leave the questionof the extension to the remainder of the Army for further coii-sideration when it was seen how the scheme was received.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The British War Medal, so far as the United kingdom was concerned, should be issued, in the first instance,only to men and women who had gone overseas;

WC 593(6.) The First Lord of the Admiralty should confer with theSecretary of State for War as to the conditions uponwhich the medal should be issued in the Navy;(c.) This decision should be communicated to the DominionGovernments and their views invited.2. The War Cabinet had under consideration the first InterimReport (Paper G.-252) of the Committee on Naval, Military andAir Force Pay, which dealt with the pay, allowances, half-pay and retired pay of officers; and the second Interim Report (paper g.-254) of the Committee, dealing with the pay and pensions of.other ranks in the Army and Royal Air Force; together with anote from the Treasury (Paper G.-252a), and a letter from theCommittee of Naval Members of Parliament, on the question ofthe pay of Naval officers (Paper G.T.-7692).The President of the Board of Education said that theCommittee of which he had been Chairman had consisted of two representatives of each of the Service Departments and of theTreasury, and they had carefully examined the data which hadbeen put before them by the Admiralty, War Office !and AirMinistry. Their reference was to correlate the proposals of thethree Departments, and this, he thought, had been done. Theyhad not considered it part of their functions to examine how far the country was able to meet the cost of the proposals. Apartfrom the general proposals, two large questions emerged: (1) in considering the pay of officers, the Committee felt that the position was to Some extent prejudged by the high rates of pay at presentenjoyed by officers of the Royal Air Force, which it would bedifficult appreciably to diminish in view of the risks of attendingflying. The Committee could not, consequently, propose any reduction in the rates put forward for the Army and the Navy,although it was felt that these rates were on the liberal side. Ifthe War Cabinet felt that they  were too high, a percentagereduction could be made all round. The Treasury had felt that,in view of the high rates of pay, allowances should not be granted in addition, and in particular they had opposed the grant oflodging and ration allowances. In principle, he (Mr. Fisher)agreed with the Treasury, but he was. influenced by the representa-tions of the Service Departments that the removal of the allowances would create bad feeling, and the Government would subsequentlyhave to grant them. In view of the proposal to assimilate theduties and training of officers of the Royal Navy and royal marines, it was difficult to differentiate between the p&apos;ay of thesetwo, and this view was concurred in by the War Office. (2) Thesecond question arose with regard to the basic rate of a privatein the Army, and in that respect there was a possibility ofconsiderable economy. The Committee recommended that aprivate should be paid 2s. 9d. on entry, rising to 4ts. after twoyears,, when fully trained. These rates were consequent upon theacceptance by the Cabinet of the recommendations of the JerramCommittee in regard to the Navy,, and it had been urged by theWar Office that there was no reason, why a fully-trained privateshould not be paid at the same rate as an able seaman.Mr. Bbnar Law pointed out that, before the War, there had always been differentiation between the pay in the Navy and theArmy.The President of the Board of Education agreed, but pointedout that we were now met with the difficulty that the royal marines would be paid at. the same rates as men in the Navy, and,although the Marine officer would in future perform similar duties to those of officers in the Navy, the same, was not the case withprivates in the Royal Marines,, and it. was feared that there wouldbe discontent and unrest in the Army if men in that service,working alongside privates in the Royal Marines, received lower
rates of pay. Mr. Fisher went on to say that, if the proposalsfor men&apos;s pay were to be altered, a start should be made on the basic rate for a private in the Army. All the other rates, including those proposed for tradesmen, were based on that, and if the WarOffice would consent to a rate of 3s. 6d. for the fully-trainedprivate instead of the 4s. proposed, it would mean a considerablesaving to the Exchequer.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he hoped the WarCabinet would not accept the rates proposed for officers in theNavy without considering the effect upon the other two Services.It was seen to-day what effect the acceptance of the rates for men had had upon the proposals for the Army and the Air Force. Hewould like the War Cabinet to understand what was involved inthe present proposals. In the case of the Navy, estimating on abasis of 11,000 officers, the number in the Navy on the 1st May,the proposals meant an increase of about 1,700,000Z. over pre-warcost, which would be increased for the current year to about,400,000^., owing to the presence of demobilisable officers. Inthe case of the Army, estimating on the pre-war establishment ofabout 10,000, the increases in pay and allowances amounted toover 3,000,000^. annually. For the current year the cost would be22,8OO,000Z., on the basis of a total average strength of 60,000officers. The cost of the proposals for the Air Force was over ,000,000Z. annually on the basis of 5,000 officers. For the current year the cost would be not less than 5,000,000Z. Mr. Chamberlainadded that, whereas the Army and the Air Force had alreadydemobilised 88 per cent, and 75 per cent, respectively of thenumber of officers they regarded as demobilisable, the Navy haddemobilised only 40 per cent, of their demobilisable officers.*The Financial Secretary to the War Office said that, in viewof the rate of demobilisation which they expected to reach in thecoming months now that Peace had been signed, the Chancellor&apos;estimate of an average establishment for the year of 60,000officers was rather high. It was true that the War Office wouldlike to retain about 58,000 officers upon the Army of Occupationbasis, but that had not been agreed to by the War Cabinet.Mr. Bonar Law suggested that the moment the House ofCommons had the figures of the total amounts which the services were asking for, there would be an immediate agitation respecting the length of time during which we were going to keep such large forces.The First Lord of the Admiralty, referring to the Chancellor&apos;sstatement that only 40 per cent, of the officers regarded asdemobilisable had in fact been demobilised, pointed out that their plans had been hindered by the calls made upon the Navy in respectof the operations in North Russia and elsewhere, which had notbeen anticipated. The Admiralty were decreasing the Navy as rapidly as possible, having regard to our commitments. As regardsthe Naval officers, he felt they should have special consideration.They had been promised increases as far back as Christmas, andthere was undoubtedly considerable unrest caused by the delay,and a feeling of indignation was being aroused that the matter was being held up yet again on account of the Army and the AirForce. With the exception of the antedating of the increases andthe question&apos; of the kept-on officers, the Board of Admiralty had accepted the recommendations of Mr. Fisher&apos;s Committee. Themen&apos;s pay had been antedated to the 1st February, and in his view it was vital that the same thing should be done for the officer.The Financial Secretary to the Admiralty pointed out thatin February 1918 the Admiralty had put up for the Treasuryproposals which were turned down with regard to the pay of senior officers in the Navy. The Halsey Committee had reportedto the Board of Admiralty on the 12th May, and the Board&apos;s pro-posals, which had been carefully examined in the course of four-teen meetings, were sent to the War Cabinet and to the treasury on the 11th June.The First Lord of the Admiralty has since stated (17th July) that the percentage is 68.
The First Lord added that at present the Naval officer wasonly paying Service rates of income tax, and under the new pro-posals he would pay civilian rates; and if, in addition, theproposed rates were reduced by a certain percentage, he wouldenjoy no advantages over his present pay.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that theAdmiralty proposals of February 1918 had been turned downwhen Mr. Bonar Law was at the Treasury, and, instead of thequestion being referred to the War Cabinet for decision, a Com-mittee, composed entirely of Naval officers, had been set up todecide their own rates of pay in his view, a most unfortunateproceeding.The First Lord of the Admiralty pointed out that the JerramCommittee, which had considered the pay of the men, was certainlyappointed by his predecessor, but the Ffalsey Committee on the pay of officers was appointed by himself, and he had taken this step&apos; on account of the strength of the feeling in the-Navy.The President of the Board of Education said that he was quite convinced of the necessity for increasing the pay of officers,but the proposed rates were certainly very liberal. -A juniorcaptain in the Navy, who before the War had obtained 629Z. ayear, would, under the present proposal, obtain 1,314 .; and a senior captain, who before the War had obtained 930Z. a year,would obtain 1,697Z.Mr. Barnes pointed out that the present rates, on account ofthe War Bonus granted on the 1st February, were considerably in excess of the pre-war rates. Further, in comparing the old andthe new rates, account should be taken of the effect of payingcivilian rates of income tax. In view of the urgency of settling the rates of Naval officers, would it not be possible to decide thoseimmediately, leaving the rates for the Army and the Air Force tobe decided later ?The President of the Board of Education thought that therates for the Navy could not be accepted without considering their effect upon the rates for the Army and the Air Force.Mr. Bonar Law expressed the opinion that officers in theArmy and the Navy should not be paid more highly than Class civil Servants.The War Cabinet then had a discussion on the rates forClass I Civil Servants, as compared with the rates proposed foj-the Fighting Services. It was pointed out that the rates pro-visionally approved for the Civil Service in future were asfollows: On entering at the age of about 23, 300Z. rising to 6001.The next grade, which was reached occasionally at the age of 33,but generally not until the age of 38, was from 800Z. to 1,000Z.Assistant Secretaries received from 1,200Z. to 1,500Z., but a manwas very fortunate if he attained this grade at the age of 40.Generally speaking, the rates of pay alone suggested for theFighting Services were superior to those proposed for the CivilService in the junior and senior ranks. In the middle, however,at about the age of 35, the Civil Servant might have some advan-tage. It was urged, on the other hand, that it was not possibleto compare the Fighting Services with the Civil Service. In theformer, an officer, except when he was on leave, was liable to becalled upon at any time of the day or night, while Civil Servantsat the close of their day&apos;s work were free. Further, junior officersin the Navy, when in charge of a ship, had great responsibilitieson their hands, with which the responsibilities of a junior civil servant were not comparable. A Civil Servant served the whole time on full pay until he retired on his pension at the age of 60.In the Fighting Services, on the other hand, officers spent a con-siderable proportion of their service unemployed on half-pay, andwere liable to be compulsorily retired after a certain age.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he must ask theWar Cabinet to make a percentage reduction on all the rates of pay proposed, and to fix the basic rate of a private in the army at 3s. Qa1. .The Financial Secretary to the War Office said that the WarOffice would strongly resist the latter proposal. In the past the. pay of a soldier had been Is. a day, and they had obtained any-body. Now it was desired to reconstitute the Army on a betterbasis, and it would inevitably lead to discontent if the pay of aprivate was substantially less than in the other Services.The First Lord said that the Admiralty could not agree to.the proposal for a percentage reduction in all the suggested rates.The result would be that some officers would be receiving less thanat present.The Financial Secretary to the Admiralty added that someof the junior officers would be receiving less than a chief pettyofficer, which would be entirely contrary to all the traditions ofNaval service.The First Sea Lord said that they should look at the ratesproposed not only from the point of view of the demands made onyoung officers, but also the responsibilities which were laid upon them, which were very great and would not diminish in future.Taking into consideration the fact that a large number of these officers were in debt, any percentage decrease in the proposals would have a disastrous effect not only on the present officers buton future entrants. The Navy were very proud of their officers,but it was becoming increasingly difficult to obtain exactly theright type. Not only was there the danger of losing officersalready in the Service, but the sources to which they wereaccustomed to look for young officers were not responding as theyused to do.The First Lord said that they could not cut down theAdmiralty proposals in any way. They had considered thequestion very carefully already, and, although it was not for theAdmiralty to look closely into the question of the general expendi-ture of the Government, he thought it was bad economy to limit the pay of our officers. It might become very necessary to economise, and perhaps to cut down the Navy to half its size, butthe last thing the Cabinet should do was to economise on officers&apos;pay.Mr. Bonar Law pointed out that, if we returned to anything like normal conditions, the pay now proposed for a secondlieutenant at the age of 19 (about 2407., with free rations, lodging,fuel, light, &amp;c.) would be out of all proportion to the salaries ofany other profession in the world.The Secretary of State for War pointed out that before theWar the pay of an officer in the Army was never in proportion to that granted in other professions. Now, the purchasing powerof the sovereign was reduced by one-half. If this matter, and allother questions relating to fixed incomes, were approached fromthat point of view, an index figure for the cost of living beforethe War would yield a very different figure for the cost of livingnow; and the salaries throughout the whole of the Public service should be increased at one stroke. The prices of commodities hadbeen forced up by the working-classes, to the serious detriment ofall people on fixed salaries. On the whole, he thought that theproposals were reasonable.Mr. Bonar Law pointed out that a young doctor, having takenhis diploma after five years&apos; college training, would consider him&apos;-&apos;self very lucky if he obtained a salary of 400Z. as an assistant at24 years of age.The Secretary of State for War, continuing, said that anofficer who had to command men had a certain style and positionto keep up, which was not necessary in civil life.   Besides, other
classes had the opportunity of taking steps to get their salariesraised in accordance with increases in the cost of living. Wecould not place our officers in a worse position than they were before the War. He thought people were unnecessarily frightenedby the figures suggested, but it should be remembered that to corn-pare them with pre-war rates they should be divided by two.The President of the Board of Education drew attention to paragraph 7 of Paper G.-252, which stated that: &quot;In recommending the emoluments for the three Servicesset out in the Appendices, the Committee have borne in mind the present devaluation of currency. The scale of emolumentsproposed would certainly be too high if the cost of livingwere to fall to its pre-war standard. And, in view of the uncertainty which attaches to the economic conditions whichare likely to prevail a few years hence, the Committee feelthat these rates should be reconsidered after the expiration of five years, when it may be found necessary, should there be a marked rise in the purchasing power of the sovereign, to lower the rates for future entrants into the Services.&quot;The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that something of thiskind would have to be done. Unless the Government guarded against it a young officer would consider that he had a vestedright, on promotion, in the pay applicable to each rank on thedate on which he entered the Service.Mr. Bonar Law thought that the revision of rates in futurewould be very difficult, and suggested that the rates proposed atpresent should be divided into pay, and bonus to meet the cost ofliving. The future was very uncertain, and it was his opinionthat in a much shorter time than was commonly thought, economicdisturbances would bring down prices to such a level that the pro-posed rates of pay would be ridiculously high.The Secretary of State for War doubted if prices would soonfall. The War Office, however, would be glad to try and meetthe difficulties of the Treasury, but he thought that the Com-mittee&apos;s proposal to review the rates of pay in five years&apos; time was impracticable. He would suggest that of the rates now pro-posed a certain percentage, say 20 per cent., should be regardedas a price bonus variable with the cost of living.The First Lord said that the rates of pay for men in theNavy had been settled after careful consideration, and had been announced without any condition attached. He could not beresponsible for making such a condition in the case of officers.The Chief of the Air Staff pointed out that the rates of payproposed for the Air Force were lower than those now obtaining.The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed that the Air force was in a different position from the other two Services.&apos; The Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff said thatnobody was more anxious to reduce expenses in the Army thanthe officers themselves, but it was impossible to live on the present rates of pay. He was in a position to confirm for the Army what had already been put forward for the Navy, that most officers were in debt; and the rates of pay now suggested were the loweston which it was felt that an officer could live.The Under-Secretary of State for Air said that he did not agree that it would be impossible to reduce the rates of pay ifprices fell. He saw no difficulty in making the announcement that,if there was a general reduction in prices and wages, the pay ofofficers should be reconsidered also.The President of the Board of Education said that his pro-posal to review the rates of pay in five years&apos; time had been severely criticised that morning; but he was convinced that wewere heading straight for disaster unless we were prepared torecognise that prices might fall rapidly, as had happened after
the Napoleonic wars. Unless an announcement of the kind weremade, the country would not stand the rates of pay proposed,except with a greatly reduced Navy and Army. He did not thinkit was possible to reduce the pay of officers once they entered theService, but, in the case of new entrants, not only could it be done,but it was the duty of the Government to do it, whatever theadministrative difficulties in the way.The Financial Secretary to the Admiralty said he did not anticipate great difficulties in the proposal if it were meant to be confined only to new entrants.Mr. Bonar Law said that it was imperative for the Cabinetto view the question from the standpoint of the possible and evenprobable decrease in the cost of living in the very near future. he strongly supported the proposal that 20 per cent, of the pay nowproposed for each rank should be considered as a bonus, to be reviewed in future, in some definite relation to the cost of livingas revealed by an official index number. He was unwilling tocome to a decision that day, in the absence of the Prime Minister.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had discussed the sum to be allotted for the Fighting Services after the Warwith the Prime Minister when preparing the Budget, and thePrime Minister had insisted that the figure which he hadprovisionally suggested, viz., 150,000.000/., was far too high.After a prolonged discussion, the War Cabinet decided To adjourn the matter until the following day, and that inthe meantime the First Lord of the Admiralty and theSecretary of State for War and Air should consider further the question of regarding 20 per cent, of the payproposed for each rank as a price bonus, to be reviewedperiodically in relation to the cost of living.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.
