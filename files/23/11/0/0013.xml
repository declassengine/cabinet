2The Coal Strike. 1. With reference to War Cabinet 598, Minute 1, the PrimeMinister said that, in regard to the dispute on piece rates, he had met on the previous day the representatives of the Miners&apos; Federa-tion, and had put the Government&apos;s formula before them, whichwas the one on which we had been operating all through. It was assumed that the loss of output owing to the reduction of hours would be 10 per cent., and the Government was pledged that thehewer should get the same wages as before. The point was thatthe time-worker received the same wages as he did before thereduction in hours, and it was not desirable to discriminate between the time-worker and the piece-worker. The Miners&apos;Federation had come forward with a counter-proposal, which theyclaimed to be practically the same thing as the Governmentformula. The miners were meeting that morning to work out their proposal in figures. Their formula was based on a reduction of hours. In certain pits the reduction amounted to one hour; insome, to fifty minutes; and in other pits less. In Durham, andNorthumberland there was no reduction at all. He had said thatthe Government was not going to quarrel over a formula, and had asked them to work out their figure, showing what the increasein piece rates would be in each area. They said that Northumber-land and Durham would get no increase; Yorkshire would getsomething under 12 per cent.; South Wales, 143 per cent., and theaverage over the whole country would work out at the Govern-menfs own figure, i.e., 11 1 per cent. He had informed the Fedsra-tion that the Government must have a definite proposal from them,and they must stand by it. The Yorkshire Miners&apos; association had not been represented at the Conference, which showed thatthere was a split in the ranks of the miners. If the Governmenthad the Miners&apos; Federation behind them in fighting the YorkshireAssociation, it would be a very great advantage. Mr. Smillie wasin a difficult position, as he did not want to go down to Yorkshireand bully them into accepting the 12 per cent., as Yorkshire wasasking 24 per cent, above what they ought to get. The Miners&apos;Federation had admitted that the. Government was in the right.As he had said, the Miners&apos; Federation was meeting that morning to put into figures their own proposal, and what he now wantedwas to get in writing from the Federation the increase in piecerates which they considered should be given in the different mining areas. The Prime Minister added that he thought the Minister ofLabour should see the coalowners, who were still in London, andcheck the figures which Mr. Smillie had put forward. If neces-sary, he himself would see the owners later in the day.Sir Eric Geddes observed that he did not think the YorkshireAssociation would be able to continue the fight very long alone; asthey were only paying 9s. a week strike pay.The Bread Subsidy. 2. With reference to War Cabinet 582, Minute 4, the WarCabinet had under consideration a memorandum by the Food Con-troller (Paper G.T.-7782) regarding the Bread Subsidy.The Food Controller said that during last winter the masterbakers, made urgent representations that they could not, under p re-vailing conditions, produce the 9d. loaf with a reasonable margin of profit, and demanded an adjustment in the price either of flouror of bread. After full investigation, he informed the trade earlyin February last that they had not made out a good case for anygeneral adjustment in prices. The operative bakers had nowformulated, under threat of a general strike on the 2nd August,certain demands which, if granted, must result in a materialincrease in costs. The master bakers, as a protest against his-decision, had absented themselves from meetings of the joint industrial Council since February last, and would probably refuseto enter into negotiations of  any kind with regard to these
WC 599demands. With a view to safeguarding the bread supply, he had urged upon the master bakers that they should enter into negotia-tions. It was necessary for the Cabinet to give an immediate decision as to the action to be adopted if the result of these nego-tiations should lead to an increase in the cost of production neces-sitating either a reduction in the price of flour or an increasein the price of bread. By advancing the price of bread ratherthan reducing the price of flour, the adjustment necessitated bythe increased cost of production due to concessions to the oper-atives would be borne by the consumer. A reduction in the priceof flour, on the other hand, would result in the taxpayer having tobear an increase in the subsidy. He therefore recommended thatany further material increase in the cost of production of breadshould be met by increasing the price to the consumer rather thanby increasing the subsidy to the taxpayer.The War Cabinet decided that -Any further material increase in the price of bread should bemet by increasing the price to the consumer.The Situation in ^&apos; With reference to War Cabinet 598, Minute 5, the WarEussia.        1        Cabinet had under consideration a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for War (Paper G.T.-7785) on the military situation inEussia.The Prime Minister referred to a question which was to beasked that day in the House of Commons in connection with thesubject under consideration, and the proposed reply.The War Cabinet approved the following as the gist of astatement to be made by the Leader of the House: &quot; It is the fact that the mutiny referred to didtake place, but it was promptly dealt with. nothing which has happened has made any difference inregard to our policy in North Russia, which has beenclearly explained to the House. Let me add that the.Government have complete confidence in general ironside, who, in their opinion, has dealt with a diffi-cult situation with conspicuous ability.&quot;The Secretary of State for War said that the existing miitary-tary situation in Russia was set forth in Paper G.T.-7785, whichhad been circulated. Orders had been issued for the two british battalions in Siberia to continue their movement towards vladivostock-vostoiv. He was of opinion that every possible effort should bemade to get the United States and Japanese Governments to give further help in the Siberian theatre. There were indications thatthe Americans were now ready to do more than.they had done inthe past, and he believed that the Japanese were quite willing tohelp. If this could be arranged, we could concentrate all our efforts on helping General Denekin. For this purpose he wouldlike to get the Cabinet to agree to a fixed sum being spent. Hewas not, at the moment, in a position to say what sum would berequired, but, if it was agreed to in principle, estimates could beprepared. When Archangel and Murmansk were evacuated andour troops withdrawn from Siberia and the Caucasus, our Russianexpenses would be only about one-fifth of what they were at thepresent time. The only other point which he wished to raise wasthe question of a commercial loan. In his opinion, such a loan wrasindispensable to the success of General Denekin&apos;s operations, inorder to make independent the territory which he wasadministering and to start trade again. It was necessary to havearticles to barter for grain in the regions in question. The country was very big, and was really capable of paying for everything. he hoped the Prime Minister would bear in mind his letter of the8th March.   The policy of evacuating our troops in North Russia
had then been clearly laid down, and also that those of the civilpopulation who desired it were to be evacuated; and, further, that,if necessary, reinforcements were to be sent out in order to enablethe evacuation to be carried out. This policy had not beendeparted from. He regretted profoundly that it had not beenpossible to give the Bolsheviks a severe blow, and that now it wasnot possible to go on unless we embarked upon big operations; but,if we were going to do this, there were other theatres more suit-able than North Russia. We were consequently faced with thepainful duty, of having to withdraw without having firmly estafo-lished the Government at Archangel, and by doing so we would, nodoubt, lay ourselves open to considerable criticism and reproach.The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew atten-tion to paragraph 8 of the War Office memorandum in so far as itrelated to. the supply of food to the Russian troops and civil popu-lation being guaranteed throughout the winter.The Secretary of State for War explained that this memo-randum had been written before the mutiny of the Russian troopsoccurred. In view of the altered situation, it would not now bepossible to carry out the proposals for.landing supplies before theport of Archangel was closed, but we would still have to offer totake away any of the friendly civil population who desired toleave.The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs raised the question of a telegram which he had read that morning inconnection with the evacuation of the Caucasus, and called atten-tion to the extreme importance of someone being in control atBatum. He added, in reply to a question by the Prime Minister,that the population at Batum consisted of Georgians, Turks, andArmenians. The population in the country round Batum was alsovery mixed.The Prime Minister thought that it was very desirable thatthe War Office paper should be read in conjunction with a ForeignOffice paper on the same subject. He agreed with the views expressed, by the Secretary of State for War, and thought that theWar Office paper was a very moderate document and merely gavefacts without reference to any decision. He thought, however,that one very important point was raised in the loreign Officepaper, namely, that the failure of Admiral Kolchak was reallypartly political. Pie had no trained politicians to help him, andconsequently appeared to have antagonised a great many people who were friendly to him in the first instance. Attention hadbeen called to the fact that General Denekin had liberated terri-tory with a population of 60,000,000* people, and, whether hecould conquer the Bolsheviks or not, he could, if supported, keep them away from this territory, which was very important to us.Although he did not wish to raise this large question of policynow, the Prime Minister said that personally he was very muchafraid that a united Russia would be a great menace to us in theEast. As regards the situation in the territory now in the handsof General Denekin, he was very much afraid that the same thingmight happen as in the case of the officers with Admiral Kolchak,and that General Denekin&apos;s officers might begin to massacrewithout &apos; discrimination. Everything indicated, that general denekin was surrounded by persons of reactionary tendencies, andit was quite possible that he might be beaten not by the Bol-shevist army in front of him, but by the forces behind him. Itwas very desirable to have effective guarantees that general denekin and the officers with him were going to play the game.He did not think it was sufficient merely to have a military mission with General Denekin, and he would like to ask if theForeign Office could make any suggestions as regards imposingconditions so as to prevent General Denekin getting into the*Aocording- to G.T. 7805, 20,000,000 should be substituted for 60.000,000.
hands of the reactionary officers around him, some of whom,though very able soldiers, were bad politicians. One telegramwhicn he had seen had stated that some of these officers hadopenly said that they were not in favour of a National Assembly,and that, jas soon as they reached Moscow, stern measures wouldbe resorted to and a Czarist regime, though milder than the formerone, set up.The Secretary of State for War pointed out that everyonewith General Denekin was pledged to a Universal SuffrageAssembly in Russia.The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said thatthe Prime Minister&apos;s remarks raised a political question on whichhe himself had intended to ask for a decision, namely, as to thedesirability of having a Foreign Office representative with general denekin. He did not wish in any way to criticise the action taken in the past by the military officers on the spot, but there wasno question that at times there was a tendency on the part of these officers to interfere in political questions. Sir Charles Eliott, theForeign Office representative in Siberia, who was a very able man,had complained that he was being interfered with in his dealings with Admiral Kolchak, and he (Lord Curzon) did not want thesame thing to happen with General Denekin. The problem had its political side, and he was quite ready to find a suitable man,not necessarily a member of the Diplomatic Service, to be sent toGeneral Denekin. He thought that the reactionaries aroundAdmiral Kolchak were stronger than those around general denekin. Moreover, General Denekin was a strong man who heldwide views.The Secretary of State for War said he was strongly infavour of the appointment of a High Commissioner at general denekin&apos;s Headquarters, but great care would be necessary inthe selection of the proper man. He suggested that the mission should be primarily political, with military representatives on it,who would continue to communicate direct with the War office on military matters. There was also the question of trade, andhe saw no reason why we should not develop trade in the areaoccupied by general Denekin&apos;s forces.Some discussion then ensued regarding the expenditure on munitions and military stores, during which it was pointed outthat, under a decision already arrived at, only stores surplus tocur own requirements could be given to General Denekin.The Prime Minister asked why a large sum in connection with trade was required. He could understand money being requiredin order to charter ships, but, as regards the territory in question,it was one of the richest in Europe and had plenty of rawmaterial.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that the Secre-tary of State for War was asking for 2,000,000Z. in order todevelop trade in South Russia.The Secretary of State for War explained that the peasantswould not give up their raw materials unless they got something in return, and it was essential to be able to barter.The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that,before the financial side was discussed, he would like a decision from the political point of view. He would like to send a politicaladviser to General Denekin. We had done our best for the caucasian States, and we were just sending Mr. Wardrop on acm political mission to advise these States, which&quot; were on thesouth of what he might call the Caucasian Range. It was very desirable that this officer should be in close touch with a similarpolitical representative at General Denekin&apos;s&apos; headquarters. he wished to guard against General Denekin undertaking any opera-tions against the States to the south of the Caucasian Range.The President of the Board of Education asked if it would
be one of the duties of the political representative to see that supplies sent by us were not squandered.The Secretary of State for War explained that GeneralHolman, who was a very efficient officer with wide experience inFrance and a good knowledge of the Russian language, had alreadybeen sent to General Denekin for this very purpose.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he would like to know what sums of money were involved, and what were the prospects of General Denekin&apos;s operations being successful. He presumed that the result of these operations would depend to a great extentupon what happened to Admiral Kolchak; for, if admiral kolchak&apos;s army collapsed completely, presumably, additional forces would be sent against General Denekin. Further, he would liketo ask what chances there were of the Americans and Japanesehelping Admiral Kolchak, as he personally had no reason for believing that the Americans would be willing to do so; they werenot doing now as much as they might. We were already payingabout one-fourth or one-fifth of Admiral Kolchak&apos;s expenses, whichwas the share agreed upon for us, and we were now being asked todo more, as the French, Americans, and Italians were doing practi-cally nothing. He supposed that, if the Americans were not readyto help, Admiral Kolchak&apos;s army would collapse altogether. from paragraph 5 on page 9 of the War Office memorandum it appearedas if the General Staff contemplated the possibility of general denekin not being able to achieve any decisive result before thewinter, and that, in such a case, great masses of the Russian people would be faced with starvation, the results of which it was im-possible to calculate. We might therefore be faced with having to feed the population behind General Denekin, and in view of our other obligations he very much doubted our capacity in money and shipping to do so. It was not necessary for him to dwell on thequestion of the exchange with America, but, unless America was prepared to find the money and not add it to the debt which we already owed her, the position would be very difficult. If weassumed this liability, it was not possible to say to what extent wewould be involved. AH that was asked for at the moment was animmediate credit of 2,000,OOOL The War Office memorandumwent on further to say that, after this summer&apos;s campaign, it wouldbe necessary once more to review the situation and to decide on our policy for 1920, and it might be said with some confidence thatthe choice would have to be made between doing a great deal more than we had done in the past or terminating all military effort in Russia. In his opinion it was quite obvious that, what-ever liabilities we undertook now by entering into an obligation, atleast an equal sum, if not more, would be demanded from us nextyear, as we would be practically undertaking to support general denekin to the end. In the circumstances, he thought it would bea hopeless task for the United Kingdom to undertake, with all itsother vast responsibilities. Unless, therefore, America and other powers would co-operate, he was quite sure that the United King-clom could not by herself undertake to restore order in Russia.From the memorandum by the War Office-he understood that thiswas also the view of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff.The President of the Board of Education said he did not wishin any way to criticise the action which had already been taken and in which he had concurred. Great credit was due to the WarOffice for the way in which they had dealt with the matter. Wehad supplied guns and ammunition to the anti-Bolshevist forces and given them up to date the most loyal support, and he did notthink that we were now under any further moral obligation toassist them. It appeared to him that at the present time russia was in the beginning of a great transformation scene. From theinformation which had trickled through, and, taking into account the experiences of past revolutions, he would say that a greatrevulsion in society had taken place in Russia.     Men without
WC 599experience had seized the reins of Government. They had stainedtheir actions with crime and outraged the feelings of the world.Like the Jacobins in France, however, the Bolsheviks now sawthat they could not get along without men of ability, and therewere indications that they were gaining experience of govern-ment and were prepared to recognise capital and property.Everything tended to show that the peasants, having acquiredland by the Revolution, would adhere to the Bolshevik Govern-ment as against Admiral Kolchak or General Denekin. he believed that the situation would gradually develop into Russiabeing governed by a Bolshevist Government, but not by Bolshevism,as everything indicated that the Bolsheviks were now ready towork in as much of the old regime into their Government aspossible. The question wras : What was our attitude to be ? he doubted if our operations had done very much, as the Bolshevikshad been able to say that the sacred soil of Russia had beenpolluted by the English, Americans, and Japanese. Having begunas doctrinaire internationalists, they were now able to appeal tothe strong national sentiment which prevailed in Russia. In thecircumstances, he thought it would be more in our. interests towithdraw than to persist in actively helping the anti-Bolshevistforces. Moreover, we were also faced by the food situation, whichwas a very grave one. It was the scarcity of food which causedBolshevism. He thought, therefore, that the best offensive wouldbe the tackling of the food question, and that, when the wintercame, provided our Allies were prepared to co-operate, we should inform the Bolshevist Government that we were prepared to sendfood to Petrograd, provided that we controlled the administra-tion. He agreed that the choice would have to be made betweendoing a great deal more than we had done in the past or terminat-ing our military efforts altogether. In view of the attitude of thepeople in the United Kingdom and of the financial situation andof the quality of the anti-Bolshevist fighting material availablein Russia, he thought that by continuing active intervention wewould be trying to make bricks out of sawdust. To sum up, wehad tried to help the anti-Bolsheviks and they had failed us, atany rate in Siberia, and he was of opinion that it was desirableto terminate active intervention altogether unless we were pre-pared to do very much more than we had done in the past.Personally, he was opposed to the latter course.The President of the Board of Trade was of opinion that theeconomic side of the question was a very important one. He didnot believe that the United Kingdom was in a position to developtrade in the territories occupied by General Denekin. It was quite impracticable, in his opinion, to have trade all on the one side. Moreover, in all directions trade developments were saidto be impossible until British credit could be obtained. Thequestion of trade in South Russia had been considered by his department some weeks before, and then the conclusion arrivedat was that the best plan w7as to provide an insurance scheme.This was now in force. Even if the military operations were going well, trade was not; and he did not think that trade on abasis of bartering was possible upon a sufficiently great scale.Its development in South Russia was in any case going to be avery slow matter. An advance of two millions would not be asufficient sum immediately to re-establish the economic prosperity of the population. Possibly 51., even 101., per head of population would, he suggested, be necessary; and this meant, at 51. per headof population, a total sum of some 300 millions. So far as his information went, he understood that the population in the terri-tories occupied by General Denekin&apos;s troops were short of every-thing, and he doubted if there was any chance, on account of theshortness of time, of being able to prevent the whole socialorganisation of the territories from crumbling to pieces during next winter, apart altogether from the question of whether wecould find the money.   He did not think we were in a positionD
to develop a purely credit trade in the territories in question, and,from the economic point of view, he would urge the Cabinet care-fully to consider if it was desirable to throw good money after bad.The Minister of Health agreed generally with the Presidentof the Board of Education. If the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff was correct in recommending that General Denekin shouldbe supported, and if it was a fact that we might have to do stillmore in the next year, he was quite sure that the Governmentwould not be supported by the people of the United Kingdom.There was no getting away from the fact that they did not under-stand the reasons for our operations in Russia, and were veryantagonistic towards them. The Government would be asked why they were intervening in Russia. The correct answer would be,in order to establish a stable Government; but it would not bepossible to give this answer, as it would be at once said that wewere supporting a reactionary Government. He laid great&quot; stress on the popular feeling in this country against operations in Russia,the reasons for which were imperfectly understood. It was a verydifficult question, and he would be inclined to say definitely thelimit to which the Government were prepared to go, as had beendone in the case of Archangel. Practically it came to saying thatin a short time we would cease to lend our support to general denekin.The First Lord of the Admiralty said he was afraid that thediagnosis of the situation as given by the President of the Boardof Education and the President of the Board of Trade was correct.Personally he was profoundly moved by the suggestion that weshould desert the large number of the Russian population whowere practically dependent on us, and he could not help feelingreluctant to abandon a people who had such great calls upon us.It was very difficult, from the information available, to arrive atany estimate of what the ultimate cost might be if intervention was continued, and. moreover, he believed that the Minister ofHealth was quite correct in what he said about the antagonisticfeeling which prevailed in the United Kingdom regarding our operations in Russia. Every report on the subject which he had read confirmed this.Mr. Barnes reminded the Cabinet that he had always regarded the situation in Russia with great uneasiness. He had supported the policy decided on by the Cabinet as the Bolshevik Governmenthad pursued a policy of repression. He thought the time had now come to consider definitely what our policy should be, taking intoconsideration the resources of the country and the feeling of thepeople. He had no doubt that the feeling among Socialists andLabour men was that the Government were pursuing a capitalistpolicy. In fact, one Labour Member of Parliament had stated ina recent speech that certain Cabinet Ministers, having financial interests in Russia, were influenced in their Russian policythereby. It was difficult to believe that a Member of parliament could make such a statement, but unfortunately it was so, andthere were always people ready to believe such tales. He did not see how the Government could pursue any policy which the peopleof the United Kingdom thought was directed against a people&apos;representative Government. He asked if it was desirable to cometo any decision that morning, and suggested that it would be agood thing if the discussion were postponed in order to giveeveryone time for further consideration.The Prime Minister agreed that it was doubtful if the cabinet could come to a decision that morning, especially as the ActingSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs had had to leave. More-over, he wished to get the views of other Ministers.The Secretary of State for War, referring to a proposal tocontinue the discussion on the following day, did not consider thatan immediate decision was urgent. It was quite conceivable thatthe anti-Bolshevist movement might collapse within the next fewmonths, and then a Lenin or Trotsky &quot;empire would be complete.
During the next few months all British troops would be withdrawnfrom Russia, except some 400 officers and men on the siberian railway and some 1,400 or 1.500 people with General Denekin.The First Lord of the Admiralty asked if he was to assume that the Cabinet approved of a battalion of Marines being sent to archangel.The Prime Minister said that if the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff was of opinion that the battalion should be sentthere, there could be no question that it ought to go, as the sending of assistance to our own troops was of very much more importance than sending a battalion to Schleswig-Holstein.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the Cabinetthat he was of opinion that a battalion of Marines should be sentto Archangel.This was agreed to.The Chancellor of the Exchequer asked if the Secretary mightbe instructed to obtain, before the next meeting of the Cabinet, areport from the Food Controller as to the possibility of supplyingGeneral Denekin&apos;s food requirements, as stated in Appendix &quot;A&quot;to Paper G.T.-7785, as well as some particulars in connection withthe food situation in the territories occupied by General Denekin.This was agreed to.The Minister of Shipping informed the Cabinet that all work was stopped at Liverpool. He would like to ask if he was at liberty to say that any ships sent to the White Sea would be usedto bring back British troops from Archangel.This was agreed to.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) All British troops, both from Archangel and Murmansk,should be evacuated.(b.) No British Mission should be left at Archangel,(c.) The  9th  Battalion,  Hampshire  Regiment,  and 25thMiddlesex Regiment should be withdrawn from Siberiaas soon as transportation and shipping facilities allow.(d.) To take note of the fact that the War Office hoped to begin the evacuation of the British troops from theCaucasus on the 15th August.(e.) The Admiralty should send a battalion of Marines to archangel.(/.) The Minister of Shipping should be authorised to statethat the ships leaving Liverpool for the White Seawould be used for the purpose of bringing back Britishtroops from that theatre.(a.) Before the&apos; next meeting of the Cabinet the secretary should obtain as much information as possible in con-nection with the food situation in South Russia, andshould ask the Food Controller to report as to the praticability of supplying General Denekin&apos;s foodrequirements, as stated in Appendix &quot; A&quot; to paper g.T.-7785.The remainder of the proposals in the memorandum by theChief of the Imperial General Staff (Paper G.T.-7785) (exceptingthe proposal to send supplies for the Russian troops and civilpopulation at Archangel, which was withdrawn by the Secretaryof State for War owing to changes in the situation within the lastday or two), together with Lord Curzon&apos;s proposal that a political officer should be attached to General Denekin, were reserved forfurther consideration at an early meeting, when the largerquestions of policy towards Russia would be discussed.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,JuPy 25, 1919.o
