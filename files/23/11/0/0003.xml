2Visit   of  H.E.H. 1. With reference to War Cabinet 587, Minute 1, the Warthe Prince of Cabinet further considered the question of the forthcoming visitWales to Canada   of H.R.H. the Prince of Wales to Canada.After some discussion, the Cabinet unanimously recommendedthat the invitation of the American Government to the Prince of wales, to pay an official visit to the United States of America onthe occasion of his impending tour in Canada, should be accepted,and that, after an official visit to Washington, His Royal Highnessshould express his willingness to pay a brief visit to New York(but solely as the guest of the United States Government) priorto embarking from there for England.Imperial Preference 2. With reference to War Cabinet 567, Minute 1, the Secre-^and British Pro- tary of State for the Colonies said that he wished to raise a pointtectorates. m regard to Section 7 of the Finance Bill (Bill No. 74) of thepresent year, wherein it was stated that, for the purposes of thisSection, &quot;the British Empire&quot; meant any of His Majesty&apos;sDominions outside Great Britain and Ireland, and any territories under His Majesty&apos;s protection, and includes India: provided that,where any territory becomes a territory under His Majesty&apos;s pro-tection, His Majesty may by Order in Council direct that that territory shall be included within the definition of &quot; the BritishEmpire &apos;&apos; for the purposes of this Section, and this Section shouldhave effect accordingly. Lord Milner said that this clause seemedto him to be very unsatisfactory, so far as mandated territories were concerned. His Department had accordingly prepared twoamendments, the adoption of one of which he was prepared torecommend to the War Cabinet. It was at least doubtful whetherthe clause, as it stood, covered &quot;mandated territory,&quot; and hesuggested that after the word &quot; protection,&quot; in line 37 on page 4of the Finance Bill, the following words should be inserted: &quot;oris a territory in, respect of which a mandate by the League ofNations is exercised by the Government of any part of HisMajesty&apos;s Dominions.&quot; He pointed out that, whereas we wouldbe able to grant Preference in mandated territories to british goods over French goods, for instance, going to that country, itwould be within our power to grant Preference to the products ofany part of a mandated territory.The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said thathe interpreted the Cabinet decision in that sense.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that the decisionof the Cabinet (War Cabinet 567, Minute 1) had been thatImperial Preference should be extended to such territories as arenow included in His Majesty&apos;s Dominions or under His Majesty&apos;sprotection, and that there should be power, by Order in Council,to extend the system of Imperial Preference to any countries whichin future might come under British protection, or in respect ofAvhich a mandate was granted to any portion of the BritishEmpire, of such a nature that the mandated territory came withinthe Customs Union of the mandatory country.Mr. Bonar Law said that his idea had been that Preferencewas to be reciprocal.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that the inten-tion, as he understood, was to give Preference all over the Empire,and he thought it would be good policy to extend to mandated territories such Preference as might be granted within the Empire.In reply to a question as to the case of Egypt, he was sure that thePowers would never agree to Egypt granting Preference to theBritish Empire.Mr. Bonar Law agreed with Lord Milner as to the desirabilityof including mandated territories in any system of Preferencewhich might be established within the Empire, as, apart fromanything else, it might have the effect of reconciling the inhabi-tants of those territories to our rule.
The Coal Industry. 3. With reference to War Cabinet 577, Minute 4, the WarCabinet had before them a Memorandum covering the Coal Mines(Control) Bill (Paper G.T.-7405) and a Memorandum on theCoal Industry (Paper G.T.-7620), both by the President of theBoard of Trade.The President of the Board of Trade stated that on the 6thJune he circulated a draft Coal Mines (Control) Bill to the WarCabinet, which was designed to carry out the recommendations ofthe First Report of the Sankey Commission. He recommendedthat the Bill should not be introduced until the receipt of theSecond Sankey Report dealing with nationalisation. This report had now been received, and a decision was required as to whether. the Bill should be proceeded with. Pie would point out that theBoard of Trade possessed no statutory power to limit the coal-The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that there was one point which he wished to suggest for the consideration of the WarCabinet. Was it advisable, from the international point of viewto-day, to say anything about the position of mandated terri-tories ? He himself felt that it was desirable that this shouldwait until the allocation of the mandates had been definitelysettled. If any premature announcement were made, strong objections might be raised by the United States, for instance. Hethought it preferable that any announcement on the sub j ect shouldbe to the effect that the terms of the mandates were not yet settled,and that the question must stand over. He did not think it neces-sary, at the moment, for us to state our policy.The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said thathe did not agree with the Chancellor of the Exchequer. He felt it important to settle this matter now. The present parliament was sympathetic to the proposed policy of the Government, and itwould, be as well to take advantage of the fact. He reminded theCabinet that the Prime Minister had authorised him to say in theHouse of Lords that Great Britain was to be entrusted with amawidate for British South-West Africa and East Africa.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that he waspresiding this week over a Commission on Mandates, which was meeting in London, to go into the whole question. He was most anxious to come out into the open about this matter, and not tohave it shelved. However awkward, the problem had to be faced,and he was in favour of facing it now. He strongly urged, there-fore, the adoption of the amendment he had recommended for theCabinet&apos;s consideration.Mr. Barnes hoped that Lord Milner&apos;s Commission would not feel that we were trying to &quot; jump &quot; claims.Mr. Bonar Law thought difficulties might arise in more thanone quarter if the United States of America adopted Preferencein her mandated territories, e.g., Armenia, as she had done in thecase of the Philippines.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said he did not thinkthat there were any grounds for Mr. Barnes&apos; apprehensions. he therefore urged complete frankness in the matter.The War Cabinet decided that After the word &quot;protection,&quot; in line 37 of page 4 (Clause 7(1)), the following words should be inserted: &quot; or is a territory in respect of which a mandate bythe League of Nations is exercised by the Govern-ment of any part of His Majesty&apos;s Dominions &quot; ;and authorised The Chancellor  of  the  Exchequer to sive effect to thisdecision.
owners&apos; profits, and that the Treasury was bearing the cost of the extra wages which the miners received. It was possible, however,for the Government to recover this expenditure by introducing the draft Coal Mines (Control) Bill, which made the limitationof the owners&apos; profits (viz., Is. 2d. per ton) retrospective to the.20th March last. The longer the introduction of this Bill was delayed, however, the more difficult would it be to recoup from thecoal-owners the profits they were making over and above theIs. 2d. per ton.The Minister of Labour said that he feared the coal-owners would regard the present agreement as to profits as being in force until it was cancelled by Act of Parliament. It was essential, inhis opinion, that the owners should be notified (if this had not already been done) of the date from which the limitation of theirprofits would take effect.The Coal Controller said that the owners had been informedthat their profits would be limited, but that no date was mentionedexcept in a verbal communication by the President of the Boardof Trade to the effect that the limitation of profits would be ante-dated to the 1st January, which was the date to which the miners&apos;wages had been made retrospective.Mr. Bonar Law said that, in his speech in the House ofCommons on the 20th March, he had stated quite definitely thatthe profits of the masters would be limited to Is. 2d. per ton.There was no doubt that, whether the limitation of profits wasante-dated to the 1st January or the 20th March, the coal-owners would offer opposition. He doubted, however, the practicability of introducing a Bill dealing with one portion of the SankeyReport when the Government had not made up its mind regardingthe Second Report.Method of Dealing The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in the third para-with the Deficit   graph of the President of the Board  of Trade&apos;s Memorandumon the -Working   (Paper G.T.-7620) he had raised the question as to whether theof the Coal In-   additional cost due to reduced output and increased wages shouldUk be borne by the Exchequer or by the consumer.   He was of the strong opinion that the cost should be borne by the consumer. Itwas impossible for the nation to live by the various sections of thecommunity subsidising each other. The Government had made aseries of concessions to various industries, with the result that thenormal course of production and distribution had been entirelyupset. The solution was, in his opinion, to allow the public torealise what the increased costs of production meant to the Stateand therefore to themselves. He could not be a party to startinga further circle of subsidies. One would naturally have supposedthat the signing of the Armistice would have been followed by a considerably reduced expenditure, but, in fact, the Budget esti-mates would be greatly increased. Especially was this the case with the Navy, Army, and Air Force.The Coal Controller said that the additional cost due toreduced output and increased wages would result in a deficit atthe rate of approximately 47,000,OOOZ. a year. Unless this was- paid by the Exchequer it would be necessary to raise the price ofcoal at the pit-head by about 6s. per ton. It had at first been thought that the increase at the pit-head would only be 4s. Qd. perton on an output of 213,000,000 tons. But when this estimatewas made, no deduction had been made for the amount of coal which the collieries themselves consumed, the amount of coalexported, or the amount required for bunkering. Under all these three heads the increased price would not be effective, and theoutput figure had to be taken at 170,000,000 tons. Some time ago the Cabinet had agreed to remove the privileged prices of coalpurchased by the Allies, and the markets were thrown open. Ithad been assumed that our profits on exported coal would be main-tained, but unfortunately it had been found that the owners, whohad now little interest in making good bargains, owing to the
limitation of their profits, had been making advance agreements,as regards exported coal, at a price less than the market prices which had formerly been quoted. The effect of this was to reduce our average export profits. In some instances, however, they hadbeen able to nullify such action on the part of the owners by with-holding export licences.The President of the Board of Trade said that, if the priceof coal was raised to the consumer, we must give up all idea of starting a spelter industry in this country; also, there was grave danger of our iron and steel industries being gravely affected.We had to realise that raising the price of coal to the consumerwould check our export trade, or at any rate lessen our power to enlarge it. He had given this question considerable thought, andon the balance he was inclined to reconunend the Cabinet to raisethe price of coal to the consumer to the full amount necessary tocover the deficit. By administering such drastic medicine we might bring the community to a state of sanity.The Coal Controller said that in certain districts the price to the consumer would be more than 6s. a ton extra, as we shouldhave to carry 8,000,000 or 9,000,000 tons more coal by sea, anddistricts such as London and the South Coast, which were served- purely by coast-borne coal, would have to pay the addition of thecoastwise freights over the railway freights. In certain districtsthe charge on sea-borne coal might amount to as much as 11. perton extra.In reply to a question as to the feasibility of importing coal from Belgium or the United States, it was stated that the pricewas prohibitive, tonnage scarce, and, in the case of the States, theExchange was against us.It was suggested that the price of coal might be, increasedgradually, but the Coal Controller said that this would createenormous difficulties in distribution, and would result in such ascramble in an endeavour to get in stocks before the price of coalincreased that his Department could not&apos; handle it.The President of the Board of Trade thought that this mightnot be disadvantageous, as, in the event of a strike, it would be useful if such stocks were in possession of the consumers.Sir Eric Geddes said that he favoured putting up the price ofcoal to the full amount to the consumer immediately, as the soonerthe country knew what they were up against the better.The Minister of Labour agreed with Sir Eric Geddes, although he feared such a policy would create a certain amount ofunemployment.Export Poli e President of the Board of Trade said he would like the lcy&apos; decision of the Cabinet regarding the export policy.   The amountof coal to be exported must be drastically cut down, and it wasnecessary to settle to which countries the exports should be made.The Chancellor of the Exchequer hoped the coal would be exported only to countries that could pay for it. He feared thattraders were looking too much to the high prices offered by countries which could not pay, and he would rather they werecontent with a smaller assured profit from countries which werefinancially sound.The Minister of Labour said that the ironmasters complained that insufficient coal was being exported to Spain, and as a resultthey were unable to obtain all the iron ore they required.The Future Form The President of the Board of Trade said that the limitationof Control. of profits to the owners and the guarantee of their profits would necessitate a much wider and more detailed system of control thanthat now existing, which was improvised for war purposes only.He would be glad to proceed with the organisation of the CoalControl Department on the lines suggested in his Memorandum(Paper G:T.-7620) (Appendix) without prejudice to the question as to whether it should or should not ultimately be constituted asan independent Ministry of Mines.[154] C
Peace Celebrations. 4. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he wished toraise a point in connection with the decision of the War Cabinetin regard to Peace Celebrations taken at a meeting held on the4th instant. The decision had been that, subject to the approvalof the Chancellor of the Exchequer, a sum not exceeding 60,0007.,The Coal Controller said that he found great difficulty in&quot;keeping the staff of his Department together, owing to the uncertainty of its future. The Sankey Report recommended thatthe limitation of profits should be operated by the present controlmachinery. This limitation, in fact, involved such a degree ofcontrol as to be practically tantamount to nationalisation. Ithad all the vices and none of the advantages of nationalisation.The result of limiting profits was, that the owners had no furtherinterest in the cost of production or in the prices obtained for theircoal, and threw back problems of management on to the coal controller. If there was a three years&apos; probationary period of this limitation of profit control, the owners would do all in their powerto make it unworkable. It was all to their advantage to do this,as the purchase of the mines by the State after the three years&apos;probationary period depended on the success of this scheme, andsuph purchase they wish to hinder in every possible way.Sir Eric Geddes doubted whether it was a practicable proposi-tion for the Coal Controller to work such a colossal scheme fromhis office in London, and thought that a policy of decentralisationwas essential unless the scheme was to break down.Mr. Bonar Law said that he understood that the reorganisa-tion of the Coal Control Department now proposed was merelytemporary. The Coal Controllers organisation must clearly beretained, for, whether nationalisation was decided upon or not,some form of control, it was obvious, would be necessary. He was of opinion that the Board of Trade and the Ministry of labour should set to work to examine the proposals contained in theSankey Reports, so that the Government should have someguidance when they came to consider this question.The President of the Board of Trade said that an examinationof the Sankey Reports from the economic side was being prepared in his Department, and he hoped that this would be available forthe Cabinet at the end of the following week.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The Draft Coal Mines (Control) Bill should not beintroduced at present.(5.) The additional cost of coal, due to the reduced output and increased wages, should be borne by the consumerby increasing the price of coal by 6s. per ton.(c.) The President of the Board of Trade should arrange togive publicity to this decision, after it had receivedthe sanction of the Prime Minister, by Question and answer in the House of Commons on the following&apos; day.(d.) To take note that the President of the Board of Tradecontinued to exercise control over the export of coal.(e.) The President of the Board of Trade should beauthorised to proceed with the reorganisation of theCoal Control Department as an interim arrangement,without prejudice to the question whether it should or should not ultimately be constituted as an independentMinistry of Mines.Note.-.With regard to decision (b) above, the approval ofthe Prime Minister to this course was received towards the close of the meeting.
WC 589in the first instance, should be placed at the disposal of the first commissioner of Works to cover the cpst of decorations; &amp;c., theFirst Commissioner tp obtain tfie sanction of the War Cabinetto any further expenditure that he might find necessary.]\ir. Chamberlain said that he regretted that he had been unableto he present when the question had been discussed, as he had had to attend a meeting of bankers in connection with the VictoryLoan. It was at this meeting that the bankers had urged uponhiin the necessity of the Government setting an example in regardto economy. There was a disposition in certain quarters tocomplain that, while the Government urged economy, they werespending thousands in wasteful extravagance, e.g., illuminations,-and so on. The Minutes of the meeting of the War cabinet referred to showed that the First Commissioner proposed to erectlarge stands to enable Members of Parliament to view the cere-monial processions. This must surely involve a considerableamount of labour, timber, &amp;c., and he thought it would be a fineobject lesson to Parliament if Members were informed that, forpurposes of economy, special privileges in respect of accommoda-tion would not be accorded to them. In regard to fireworks, hewas glad to see that the Cabinet had decided that the expenditure should not be on an extravagant scale.The First Commissioner of Works stated that the original estimate for fireworks had been cut down by one-half, and notmore than 10,000Z. would be devoted to this purpose. The general feeling at the Cabinet on Friday last had been that, if there wasto be an official day for the celebration of Peace, the arrangements must be on an adequate scale. As regards stands for Members ofthe House of Commons, he wished to point out tha,t no timberwould be required, as arrangements had been made to use oldshell-boxes. Moreover, the Lord Chamberlain and the Speakerhad already been informed that the Cabinet had agreed to theerection of these stands. Pie hoped that the cost to the treasury for the stands would be comparatively small. It was proposedto charge a nominal sum of 10s. for each seat, which meant thatthe charge on the public purse would not exceed 2,000Z.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he felt bound,under present conditions, to protest against any unnecessaryextravagance. He himself had stated publicly, when pleading forcontributions to the Victory Loan, that the money subscribedwould not be devoted to any new expenditure. How could hejustify this pledge if the public became aware of the large sums which were to be devoted to illuminations and display? Hethought that it would be easy to have a question asked in theHouse of Commons, to which a reply might be given to the effectthat, in view of the shortage of coal, the Government had subse-quently decided to cancel their original project of illuminations.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that strong representa-tions had recently been made to him in respect of the entertainmentof Members of both Houses of Parliament on the occasion of their proposed visit to the Fleet at Southend. It was a rather excep-tional occasion, as the Fleet onlv came to the River Thames once in ten years. The cost of entertainment, however, was estimated,at about 10.QOOZ. He would be glad to receive the instructions ofthe War Cabinet on the subject.Lord Curzon said that, as Chairman of the Cabinet Committeeon Peace Celebrations, he had wished to cut down the estimates for decorations, &amp;c, to 25,000Z. Several Ministers, however,including the Prime Minister, had been of opinion that the celebra-tions should not be carried out in a niggardly spirit. Paris, ofcourse, was conducting her celebrations on a colossal scale, withwhich we had no intention of competing. After some discussion the Cabinet had decided that 60,000Z. was not an excessive sum.As regards illuminations,- a communique had alreadv been issued to the press deprecating the lighting of bonfires. He could not,however, agree with the Chancellor in regard to the cutting out
of illuminations, although he was himself in favour of reducing expenditure as much as possible. In fact, his Committee had originally contemplated a grant of some 10O,0O0Z. to 200,000Z.,which he himself had strongly discouraged. The 19th July,however, would be a day of universal rejoicing, to commemorateperhaps the greatest event in our history. Hundreds of thousands of people would be in the streets, and a certain amount ofillumination would be necessary to keep them moving. If the streets were inadequately lighted there might be confusion and.worse.The President of the Board of Education suggested that theGovernment might arrange for public buildings to be illuminatedon a moderate scale, but that clubs and private individuals mightbe discouraged from wasting gas and electricity.Lord Curzon said that he agreed with Mr. Fisher.The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought that if the Govern-ment set an example in the way of illumination, the rest of thepublic would surely follow.   Example was better than precept.The Minister of Labour said that he was in entire concurrencewith the views of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Secretary of State for the Colonies felt that, in spite ofthe coal shortage, as the Government had decided on a day ofrejoicing, the celebrations must be done properly. He understoodthat it had already been decided to spend 10,000Z. on fireworksin Hyde Park, and he thought it would be ridiculous to permit this and to have no illuminations elsewhere in the Metropolis.Nothing was worse than letting the celebrations tail off in the evening and end in a fiasco.The Secretary of State for India said that he would like to.agree with the Chancellor of the Exchequer in regard to his proposal that the illuminations should be dropped, as he attachedso much importance to the other proposal, mentioned by the FirstLord of the Admiralty, that Members of Parliament should visit the Fleet at Southend. Pie thought that Members of both houses were fully entitled to see the instruments by which the war hadbeen won. In his view, to refuse a grant of 10,O0OZ. for Members&apos;entertainment on that occasion would increase the acerbity of thepresent&apos;temper of the House of Commons, which would think thatthe Government was disturbed by recent criticism and taking-petty revenge in this way.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the feeling of theHouse of Commons, and. in the press, was very strong on thesubject, and the Government might have to give way to it.Lord Curzon reminded the Cabinet that Members of Parlia-ment had paid, their own expenses on the occasion of their visits to the Fleet at Spithead at both Jubilees of the late Queen Victoria.Mr. Bonar Law enquired whether the visits to the Fleet mightnot be made self-supporting, or practically so.The War Cabinet decided (a.) To adhere to their previous decision, that the Frst Com-missioner of Works was authorised to expend public money up to 60,000Z. in decorations, illuminations, &amp;c,in connection with the forthcoming Peace Celebrations.(5.) That the First Lord of the Admiralty should enquire,and report in due course, as to the possibility of ensuring that the suggested entertainment of Membersof Parliament visiting the Fleet at Southend should- - entail no charge upon the public funds.Persons in Govern- 5. With reference to War Cabinet 585; Minute 1, the Warment ^Service not Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (Paper G.T.-7600) on the retention in Govern-ment offices of established Civil Servants not being persons ofof British orAllied Parentage.
Supply of Grain to 6- With reference to War Cabinet 572, Minute 2, the Warthe Egyptian Ex-   Cabinet took note of a Memorandum by the Minister of ShippingpeditionaryForce.    (Paper G.T.-7582) on the question of the supply of grain to theEgyptian Expeditionary Force.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,July 8, 1919.[154]DBritish or Allied parentage. It was pointed out in the memo -randum that the question of continuing such persons in Govern-ment employment could not be properly considered by the purelyDepartmental Committee established by the Ministry of Labour,in accordance with War Cabinet 577, Minute 2, to determine towhat extent persons temporarily employed could be replaced bydisabled soldiers, and that the enquiry, if any, on the matter mustbe by a Committee of Ministers and not a Departmental Committeeof Civil Servants sitting in judgment on their fellows. TheChancellor of the Exchequer further expressed the opinion that,as the Civil Servants in question had served throughout the War,and no complaint had been made against any of them, he could give no support to the proposal to drive them out of the Service.Mr. Bonar Law said that the matter appeared to be one whichshould be considered by the Home Affairs Committee. In his view, the answer to be made to questions on this subject in theHouse of Commons should be that the British Government, in the days before the War, had made a bargain with people of alienextraction of the classes under consideration, and had invited themto join the Civil Service. In consequence, the War being nowover, the British Government were bound by their bargain withthese established Civil Servants, and could not expect to be released. As to the future the case was different, and the matter would be considered in all its bearings.The War Cabinet decided that The memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer(Paper G.T.-7600) on the position of persons in Govern-ment service not of, British or Allied parentage, shouldbe referred to the Home Affairs Committee for considera-tion in the light of the views expressed by Mr. Bonar Law.
Appendix.THE COAL INDUSTRY.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.IT is important that the Cabinet should give an early decision on several questions arising out of the acceptance by His Majesty&apos;s Government of the first Sankey Report.In view of the reduced output and increased cost of coal the matter has becomeurgent: 1. On the 6th June I circulated (G.T.-7405) a Draft Coal Mines (Control) Bill tocarry out the recommendations of the First Report of the Sankey Commission. Irecommended that the Bill should not be introduced until the receipt of the second report dealing with nationalisation. This has now been received, and a decision is desired whether the Bill should now proceed.2. The future form of Coal Control. The limitation of profits to the owners andthe guarantee of their profits will necessitate a much wider and more detailed system ofcontrol than that now existing, which was improvised for war purposes only. I attach a memorandum by the Coal Controller (Annex (A) i with which I am in generalagreement. I should be glad of authority to proceed with the reorganisation of theDepartment on the lines suggested, without prejudice to the question whether it should or should not ultimately be constituted as an independent Ministry of Mines.3. Method of dealing with the deficit on the working of the Coal Industry. Annex (B) contains a note by the Coal Controller with tables attached on the subject of output. The best estimate that can be given of the output of coal for the next twelvemonths is 215,000,000 tons. The additional cost due to the reduced output and increased wages will result in a deficit at the rate of approximately 47,000,000L a year.Unless this is paid by the Exchequer, it will be necessary to raise the price of coal atthe pit-head by about 4s. Qd. a ton. A decision is necessary whether the deficit on theworking of the coal industry shall be paid out of the Exchequer or the price of coalraised to the consumer.4. Export Policy. If the same amount of coal is to be provided for inlandconsumption and bunkers as in 1918, which was about 13,000,000 tons less than theaverage&apos; annual consumption of the five pre-war years, not only must the present restrictions on consumption be maintained, but exports must be reduced by about11,000,000 tons a year below the 1918 figure, which was considerably less than halfthe figure for the pre-war year 1913.. If it is decided to reduce exports, it is necessary to determine in what proportionthe reduction should apply to foreign countries. Having regard to the necessity for maintaining our imports of raw materials, exports to Spain and Scandinavian ports should not be materially reduced. Exports to Italy should remaiu at approximately the same quantities as in 1918, and the principal reduction should take place in thequantity exported to France.The following table has been prepared by the Coal Controller showing the quantities of coal exported to foreign countries in the years 1913 and 1918 and theamounts to which it is proposed that those exports should now be reduced in eachcase :  Country.	1913.	1918.

WC 5895. Carriage of Coal Coastwise.-The diversion to inland consumption of coalpreviously exported raises the question how far this will have to be met by the use ofcoastwise traffic. Unless this is done the strain on the railways must be intensified.Carriage by sea will, however, seriously increase the cost of coal to the consumer inthose districts which will be dependent on sea-borne coal, unless the control of shipping is maintained and shipping requisitioned for the purpose.July 3, 1919. &apos; A. C. GEDDES.ANNEX (A).Note by the Coal Controller.Permanent Organisation for Control of Coal Mines.The Coal Mines Department is at present a purely temporary organisation,attached to the Board of Trade, and the staff is comprised in the main of administrative officers and clerks borrowed from the railway companies and business houses, and of volunteers who have placed their services at the disposal of the Department during theperiod of the war. The Department is now going through a process of disintegration the volunteer officers cannot be expected to extend their services indefinitely, whilethe loaned officers are now required to be returned to the sources from which they were temporarily borrowed.It is, I submit, imperative that, in view of the new position created by the InteriinReport of the Coal Industry Commission, the Department should be reorganised on apermanent basis at once. Whether it be subsequently determined by the Governmentto purchase the mines or not, the measures of control necessary in any event will be,to all intents and purposes, almost equal in magnitude, and with the exception ofthe actual direct employment of labour, the control will in all other respects cover the whole of the working of the coal industry. Further, the reorganisation of theadministration of the control should be so arranged that the reconstituted department would, with slight readjustment, be in readiness if need be to take over the whole ofthe duties of a Ministry of Mines. In this connection it is particularly desirable thatthe future status of the Department should be definitely settled as soon as possible.A reorganisation of the Department on permanent lines as recommended willprovide an opportunity for improvement in the co-ordination of the work of theseveral divisions and in the internal administration of the office. I should recommend,in this connection, that the services of capable and experienced civil servants, with aknowledge of Government and Departmental procedure, should be obtained ; and nodoubt the Treasury &quot; Pool&quot; would be available, from which the permanent staffnecessary for building up of an efficient organisation could be drawn. While the CoalMines. Department remains on a temporary footing any excessive changes areimpracticable, but I most strongly urge the desirability of taking in hand withoutdelay the settlement of the future status of the Control Department and its establishment.upon a permanent basis. As soon&apos; as these questions are decided I shall be glad towork out a considered scheme for providing adequate machinery for the purposes ofthe control.E. D. J. .May 7, 1919.ANNEX (B).The following information is supplied as regards output, &amp;c, of coal based on thelatest information obtainable.The output for the first twenty weeks of 1919 was at the rate of 242,000,000 tons per annum as compared with 280,000,000 tons in 1913.The average number of men employed during the twenty weeks was 1,111,000,being exactly the same number as the average employed during the year 1913.The average weekly output for the four weeks ending the 24th May, 1919, duringwhich period there were no holidays and few stoppages, was&apos;4,813,000 tons, or at therate of, say, 238,000,000 tons per annum after allowing 5 per cent, for holidays and stoppages.
The average weekly output of the sis weeks ending the 15th March, during whichconditions were fairly normal (with no holidays and few strikes or stoppages) ; theaverage output for the four weeks ending the 24th May, when similar conditionsprevailed and the Sankey wage was in operation ; and the average number of personsemployed in the respective periods are as follows : 	Six weeks ending March 15.	Pour weeks ending May 24.Average number of persons employed Average output per week Output per man per week Output per actual man shift	1,081,000 4,852,000 4-5 -92	1,124,000 4,813,000 4-3 -90The percentage of absenteeism due to sickness, injury, and voluntary absence,shown as a percentage of the possible number of shifts which could have been worked,increased from an average of 10&quot;7 per cent, in 1913 to an average of 12 &quot;5 per cent, in.the first twenty weeks of 1919, and to an average of 13 per cent, in the four weeksending the 24th May.The average number of days per week on which pits raised coal decreased from5-58 in 1913 to 5&quot;2() in the first twenty weeks of 1919.The average output per man per period of four weeks decreased from 19&apos;0 tons in1913 to 16-8 tons in the first twenty weeks of 1919, and 17T tons in the four weeks ending the 24th May, during which period there were no holidays and fewstoppages.The average output per actual man shift worked was 1 ton for the year 1913, &quot;89 ofa ton for the first twenty weeks of 1919, and &quot;90 of a ton for the four weeks ending the 24th May.The estimated output for the year 1919 on the basis of the average weekly outputof the first twenty weeks, and allowing for the reduced hours after the 16th July is,say, 230,000,000 tons, or calculated on the weekly output for the first twenty weeks,the output for the remainder of the year being estimated on the average weekly output for the four weeks ending the 24th May, with an allowance of 5 per cent, for holidays and stoppages, say, 228,000,000 tons.The estimated output for twelve months from July 1919 after the reduced hourshave come into force is, say, 217,000,000 tons calculated on the output of the first twenty weeks, or, say, 214,000,000 tons calculated on the weekly output of the four weeks ending the 24th May, 1919, with an allowance of 5 per cent, for holidays andstoppages.The consumption of coal for inland purposes and bunkers was 210,000,000 tonsin the year 1913 (the average for the five pre-war years was 209,000,000 tons) and forthe year 1918 was 196,000,000 tons.The exports of coal in the year 1913 were 77,000,000 tons, and in the year 191834,000,000 tons. In order to provide approximately the same quantity of coal forinland consumption and bunkers for twelve months from July 1919 all present restrictions on consumption must be fully maintained, and in addition exports must bereduced from a rate of 34,000,000 tons per annum to a rate of 23,000,000 tons per annum.It is estimated that the deficiency on the working of the industry on the basis ofthe estimated outputs given for the period of twelve months from July next, afterproviding for the guaranteed profits to owners at the rate of Is. 2d. per ton, will beabout 46,600,000L, equal, to 4s. 3d. per ton of output. For the calendar year 1919 itis estimated that the deficiency will be 37,000,0002.Seven Schedules have been prepared setting out the details on which theconclusions contained in this memorandum are based. These Schedules are attached here to.* E. D. JONES.Coal Mines Department,June 3, 1919.
