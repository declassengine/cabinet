He had refused the request that the British treasury should (contrary to the February agreement) make further advances at the rate of 2,000,OOOZ. a month from september next till the 31-st December, 1920, and had expressed his surprise that, in view of the terms of the february agreement, such a request should have beenpreferred.(4.) On the other hand, he had told Signor Schanzer that hewould view favourably any arrangements which an italian consortium of banks, merchants and manufac-turers might make with English banks for openingcredits for the purchase of British Empire produce, buthe had stated definitely that the British Treasury couldneither give any guarantee of such credits nor ask theBank of England to give any special facilities in relationto them.The Chancellor of the Excheqer asked whether his action hadthe approval of the Cabinet, or whether the circulation of paper g.-T. 7846 and of Paper W.C.P.-1203 required any modification ofpolicy.The &quot;War Cabinet approved the action taken, and authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to proceed on these lines.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, ,August 5, 1919.0
