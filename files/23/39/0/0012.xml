ISS^fSWtosmT.    (I)    With reference to Cabinet 75 (21) Conclusion 1,the Conference considered the question of unemploy-ment.     The Minister of Labour gave detailed figuresregarding unemployment in London and other parts ofthe country, estimating that during the coming winterthe number of unemployed would amount to one and a quarter to one and a half million.    The Poor LawGuardians were now finding it difficult to render assistance and benefits from Trade Unions had entire--ly given out.    The Uheimployment Benefit would not come into force again until the 3rd November and immediate steps were necessary to meet the situationbetween now and that date.   Lr Macnamara said thathe did not think the amount of assistance rendered by the Government to alleviate unemployment was generally recognised.    Since the Armistice until31st March 1921, 62 millions had been paid out andfrom November until the present date  44 millions.Three-quarters of the latter sum had &quot;been contributed by employers and employed under the Act.    LrMacnamarai continuing, said that employing men onartificial work could really only touch the fringe ofthe problem.    To deal effectively with the questionwork must be found for unemployed in the branch oftrade in which they had been trained.   He was infavour of getting some of the leading employersround a table and Risking them in what way theGovernment could render assistance to them to absorbmore men in industry and restarting their works, e,g.,by enabling them to give long credit to customers.This suggestion by the Minister of Labour foundgeneral acceptance and it was generally agreed that,although the ijaimediate problem for solution was to&apos;  A, .-1-        -      ;
renda^assistance ^tance to the Poor Law auardiaja^^jpxrtrmig^ions such as tha^m&amp;de-4ry--l^ must be exploredin order to get at grips with the problem.The discussion then turned to the question of Treasuryassistance to poor Law Guardians.   Sir Alfred Mond saidthat a number of Guardians found it quite impossible to borrow money and that when pec-plo-^ert^-e^c4nzall^the State must come to the assistance of Local authorities.Mr Hilton Young said that hitherto it had not beenmade clear that local, Authorlilea were now unable tc borrowfrom the Banks.     Of course if people-wer^-eclrujall^the State must step in, but it must be remembered that such,a precedent was full of danger inasmuch as the Banks mightrefuse to loan money in future to Local Authorities and tell them to go to the State,   further there was no existingauthority under which the Treasury could borrow money forsuch a purpose,    parliamentary sanction would have to beobtained.Reference was the made to schemes of public utilitywhich had been put forward on which unemployed couldbe used and the Prime Minister requested the Minister ofHealth to prepare a statement shewing the number and natureof the schemes, the amount of expenditure they would involve,and the number of men they vmuld. employ.After further discussion the Conference agreed:-(i) That the Ministry of Health be entitled to assistPoor Law Guardians who cannot raise further financialassistance by informing the Banks that if a loan is granted the Government intend, when Parliament meets,to introduce legislation to enable the Treasury to repay these loans. Such legislation will include therendering of financial assistance to poor Lav/ Guardiansbe requested to&apos; advance a sum, up to a maximum of  \ 600,000, to the St.David&apos;s Committee to carry on the-&apos;work they are going, when their present funds are     \exhausted, but that before definite action is taken   \the consent of/ the Chancellor of the exchequer should be obtallied.
