It     The Conference had before them a telephone message from Loasd!. Curzon (c.P.4203) setting out the positions which, subject to the approval of tho Cabijiet.....^   Ihe proposed to take up in the discussion which wouldtake place on the following day, for the purpose of arriving at a preliminary understanding with Prance andItaly as to the conditions in which the Allies would enter the Peace Conference with Turkey/., THE SECRETARY ;0F STATE FOR A;AH read a telegram fromGeneral Harington (-No.2362 of September 20th.), in whichit was stated that the French and Italian Commanders, had^ordered to withdraw their detachments from Chanak andIsmid.,    Tho detachments consisted of one company eachtOn the other hand such French and Italian forces as   .remained on the European side would remain under his .command.,iA Conference had been called at Smyrna by Mustapha Kemalfor. the 21st September which&apos;was no doubt to decide whatpolicy should be followed in the light of the british attitude. .. He did&apos;-not think that Kemal would dare toattack, and hoped that firm action would prevent fightingsTHE FIRST LORD OP THE ADUIEA TY read a telegramfrom Sir H. Lamb at Smyrna, to w^which -it-appear^ thatNoureddin Pasha had strongly insisted in conversation onthe necessity of negotiations in ord.er to prevent a conflict,failing which&apos;tho Turks would certainly attempt to rushthe neutral zone.    He did not think-that the Turks would agree to w ait longer than September 30th.   Bodies ofTurks had been seen marching North on the morning ofSeptember 20th.TE3 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES stated thata thousand men of the Royal Air Force were on their wayto Mesopotamia      for the most part highly skilledmechanics and unarmed.   They&apos; would shortly be passing through tho Mediterranean.   No doubt if the situation were highly critical, they could be sent in as/reinforcements
 reinforcements, though having regard to their great skill and technical training, it would be very wasteful to use them for the purpose.

 The Conference then considered what answer should be sent to Lord Curzon&apos;s message (C.P.4203).

 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES stated that his only criticism was in regard to the permanent arrangements for Chanak, which for a certain zone would have to be the same as those in Gallipoli. So far as concerned the Bosphorus, he thought demilitarisation would be sufficient. But in the case of the Dardanelles, occupation by a force under the League of Nations on both sides of the Straits was essential. Inspection against fortification was not enough. The Powers must have free access.

 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said that no doubt Lord Curzon would make a fight against laying down conditions relating to Thrace ahead of the Peace Conference, but it would be Mustapha Kemal&apos;s great point that he would not enter a Conference without them. The question of the Maritza boundary and Adrianoplo were not vital to Great Britain.

 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES observed that any concession on that head must be in conjunction with the demilitarisation of the Straits.

 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR observed that we should require a zone under the protection of the League of Nations at Chanak just as at Gallipoli, whereas Kemal might object to any other Power but Turkey being in Asia minor.

 THE PRIME MINISTER summed up that all that was required was to strengthen the line that Lord Curzon had taken in respect of the Straits by insisting upon a zone at


at Chanak, For the rest he would, give- Lord-Curzon.,a^freshand.On the question of the admission of Russia to thePeace Conference, THE PRIMS MINISTER, thought tt would be unwise to object if thS Turks Insisted that they must brlhgtheir only Ally.     It was not for Great Britain to suggestit, but they should not appose it if the Turks asked for it,and it vo uld be interesting to see what attitude the french would adopt.THE SECRET-&apos;RY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES suggestedthat Bulgaria also had a right to be heard.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that he wished to indioatein the telegram to Lord Curzon that the policy of thaGovernment in regard to the Straits was confirmed by thediscussion with the Labour Deputation, and the country would strongly support the Government;   but the cabinet were also confirmed in their view that the oountry wouldnot be willing to make any military exertions in respeotof Thrace.     The Cabinet would, therefore, give Lord Curzonthe fullest latitude, but would not give him authority topledge Great Britain to military assistance to resist a turkish olaim to the Maritza boundary.     He should be fullyauthorised to make any arrangements which would secure peace.It was agreed:-(See Conclusion (a).)2. THE REIMS MINISTER enquired what answer should be.VEHTXONJ sent to Lord Balfour with relation to the. intervention ofUE OFthe League of Nations. The telegram sent on the previous day had merely stated that Great Britain had no objectionsto the/
0 (-j site tho resolution being passed by the 6th Concussion ofthe Assembly?     but he was of opinion that something moreemphatio was required.Some discussion then took place as to the form the reply to lord Balfour should take.TEE PRIME MINISTER thought it was desirable thatthe telegram should be so drafted that it could be readin the House of Commons.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL thon prepared a draft telegram to the effect that the Cabinet would cordially welcome theassistance of the League of Nations in securing a peaceful settlement and they therefore hoped Lord Balfour would support the resolution to be moved.TEE SECRETARY OP STATE POR THE COLONIES referred toa telegram from Lord Balfour to Lord Curzon, in which lord balfour suggested that Lord Curzon should go to Geneva, and expressed the opinion that it was most important that nothing should happen to delay Lord Curzon&apos;s immediate return toEngland so soon as hiE business in Paris was completed.It was agreed:-(see Conclusion (b).)3v TEE PRIME MINISTER informed his colleagues that.M. the King had written to him that he entirely agreed with the Government&apos;s decision, and approved of the firm-ness they had displayed.The Conference took note of the He tter from HisMajesty -- read by the Prime Minister - which gave muchpleasure to His Ministers.
CONCLUSIONS REACHED AT A CONFERENCE OFMINISTERS held&apos;&quot;on THURSDAY..21st September,:1922, at 12-45 p..ra.The Conference agreedThat in reply to -the telephone message of evendate from Lord Curaon (C.P.4203) giving his views as to the position he should take, up in regard tothe conference the Foreign Office should send a telegram which was drawn up and approved at themeeting and which was to the following effect the Cabinet tiould give Lord Curzon fulllatitude to approach the questions of Thraceand Constantinople on the lines of his- telegram,subject to the following considerations in regardto the Straits, - The Cabinet, considered the asiatic side of the Dardanelles to be an integral part of the problem of the maintenance, of thefreedom of the Straits..     The same.regime,therefore, as is adopted in the case of Gallipolishould also be adopted In the case of an agreedzone on the Asiatic side of the Straits.     TheCabinet did not consider sufficient demilitaris-ation combined with occasional visits.     The cabinet would not object to the presence.of Russia at theConference if desired by the Kemalists,That in reply to Lord Balfour&apos;s telegrams regardingthe proposed Intervention of the League of nations in the Eastern question, the Poreign ^fflae should send a telegram to Lord balfour to the effect thatBord Ourzon^s telegram the previous day approving the resolution to be moved at the Sixth commission was being sent in consultation with and with the.full approval of the Cabinet; that the Cabinet   -would cordially welcome the assistance of theLeague of Nations in securing a peaceful.settlement and that they therefore hoped that Lord Balfourwould Support the resolution to be moved.The Foreign Office should repeat this telegram toLord Curzon in ParisoTo take note of a letter from His Majesty TheKing tb the Prime Minister which gave much pleasureto hie Ministers.2.
