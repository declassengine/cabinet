POLITICAL SITUATION IN INDIA.

MR. MONTAGU referred to the telegram received from the Viceroy, dated 18th December, (Annexe I) emphasised the need for an immediate reply to Lord Reading as the Prince of Wales was due to arrive in Calcutta on the 24th instant, and the Viceroy who was to receive a deputation headed by Malaviya on the 21st instant, was to leave Calcutta on the 22nd instant.

He explained the nature of the volunteer movement in India. It consisted of the drilling of bodies armed with "lathis" which were used as a substitute for rifles for drill purposes. These volunteers had appeared in Bangalore, Delhi and Caunpore?. Their number was small but he had impressed upon the Viceroy that the drilling was an intolerable insult to Government. Up to now the movement had not become dangerous and it was not illegal but it was a dangerous movement and the Viceroy proposed to pas legislation at the next session making it illegal. The volunteers referred to in Lord Reading&apos;s telegram were of a different nature. They were an association of young men not of a military stamp organised to take part in the non-co-operation movement and to render social service. The movement had its commendable side, for one of its objects was to break down the barriers of caste and to give assistance to the untouchables. These volunteers in the present situation have become dangerous. They are now used by the non-co-operators to organise "hartals" and for purposes of 

 
intimidation. ,   The Viceroy&apos;s policy of Jcrde hadirrrnedlately been successful.     The non-co-operatorsbecame alarmed and at once made a movement for an accommodation with Government.     He read a draft ofhis proposed reply to the Viceroy as follows&quot;Private and personal.     Your private and personal telegram of the 18th Decemberreceived last night at a time when theGovernment is deeply preocotipied withan International Conference,     They aredesirous of sending you as helpful an answer as they possibly can, but timedoes not permit either of detailed examination of all the bearings of your proposals or of elucidation of certain aspects which would appear to require futher consideration.A.    HeMs!s Government would of courseoffer no objection to your agreeing toreceive in Conference anybody whom you would desire to receive,     A dismiss ionwould certainly have the obvleus advantages of leading to the formulation of the demands made by the different sections of indian opinion, and in the discussion the sincerity of your Government, and what it had already done and is doing could be forciblydemonstrated..     Therefore if you are askedto agree to a conference, H.M.*s Governmentwould concur in your agreeing, but theywould make two observationsa(1) You will of course not losesight of your duty to the Members ofyour legislature which must be fulfilledIn dealing with those who have failed tosecure or refused to attempt to secure,election to the legislature.      I say this although it appears to be obviousthat your legislature ^ould welcome such a conference.(2) I must not leave you in any doubt that it would be almost, if not entirely, impossible to get Parliamentafter one short year&apos;s trial, to extend the Government of India Act, 1919. andI notice that., as at present advised,you see no necessity or cause for suchan extension^     What is required i3that within the four walls of thestatute, Indians should take advantageof their new opportunities as theywould appear to have done in this lastyear, so that they can come in due course to Parliament, and base their claims, not on demands which were considered so recently, but on actual work done and actual conventions of political life established, and it may well bethat within the scope of the present act these opportunities could be-further extended3
B. In assenting to a Conference you cannot mean, I imagine, to make it conditional upon a welcome to the Prince of Wales,   any idea of such a bargain would, it seems to usbe most Improper and certain to have unfortunate-nate consequences in the future.     You can,of course, make it quite clear that a conference would be Impossible if. the Congress leaders and those who follow their lead were breaking the law and necessitating prosecutions or evenactively indulging in hostile demonstrationsand that a conference would only be possiblein an atmostphere of peace.   Any idea of using the Prince as the consideration for a bargainshould be eschewed and if necessary repudiated,C, I come now to the release of prisoners and the withdrawal of .the proclamation againstvolunteers.      I find it difficult to agreeto the release of prisoners except on an understanding that they will, on release,abstain from those activities which render them liable to prosecution, and with a clearlyexpressed determination that they will be prosecuted again if there is any repetition of the offences for which they are nowimprsioned, but bargains with individualprisoners are useless unless sxipplementedby undertakings from those who are in aposition to direct their actions.    Further,it seems to me impossible to say that becauseyou have assented to come into conference,institutions which you regardecb4s illegalyesterday you now regard as legal, whichwould be the result of the withdrawal of the proclamations.      The proclamations would onlybe withdrawn if it were shewn that the volun-teer associations had ceased to be dangerous to the public order, or if their members had ceased to commit breaches of the law.    Thatis to say, the proclamations could only be withdrawn on an undertaking that militarydrilling and interference vrith public order and with the liberty of the public or of individuals would cease; to be practised.I am sure I need not remind you to considerthe position of local Governments and protect their prestige In whatever action you may decide on.Subject to these observations, HisMajesty&apos;s Govern ent concur in your proposal.LORD curzon stated the Viceroy&apos;s telegram raised the most formidable and far reaching questions of policy,and the draft reply did not appear to him to meet thesituation.     The Viceroy appeared to be ready to(3)
 compromise the whole Indian policy of the Government and to endanger British rule in India in order to purchase the ephemeral advantage of a good reception for the Prines of Wales in Calcutta. In view of the Course of events in India during the past three months, he thought that Lord Reading&apos;s action in arresting large numbers of Indians, including prominent men, leaders of society and members of Council at the present time when the Prince was in India, to be most unfortunate. The idea of making a bargain with Malaviya&apos;s deputation, agreeing that the Government of India should withdraw the Proclamation against the volunteers and hold a conference with all the disloyal elements in India, if non-cooperators would consent to cancel the "hartal" arranged for Calcutta should never be agreed to. It must be clearly understood that the Conference suggested in January at Delhi was not an ordinary conference. It is based upon the analogy of the Irish Conference, and as pointed out by Lord Reading, it is certain that it inevitably means the discussion of Swaraj and the repeal of the Government of India Act of 1919. He strongly opposed the idea of any such Conference being sanctioned. There could be no concessions on the question of "swaraj" and if the conference had no results the consequences would be deplorable. As it had been known for some time that a "hartal" in Calcutta was probable, suitable measures should have been taken to meet the situation, and the Viceroy should have referred the question to His Majesty&apos;s Government at an earlier date. Lord Curzon added that he had discussed the question with the 

 
Lord-Chancellor, who had informed him thatprima facie he was opposed to the idea of thesiigge ate d 0onf erence  .MR. CHURCHILL entirely agreed with Lord Curzon&apos;remarks.    Ho was strongly opposed to consent being given to a Conference at twenty four hours&apos; notice. If aConference was agreed to, it would mean   an immediatedemand for the scrapping of the Montagu-Chslmsfordreforms snd the demand for the substitution of some form of self-government.     The idea of bargaining fora good reception for the Prince of Wales in Calcuttawas most ignominous.    It would be far better to cancel the visit of the Prince cf Wales to Calcutta, than to compromise the Government&apos;s policy in India in orderthat he might have a good reception there.   Hesuggested that the Viceroy should be informed that nodeparture in policy should be made by him in order tosecure a good reception for the Prince in Calcutta andthat the questian of whether the proposed conference should be held or not would be considered by his majesty s Government in the ensuing week,MR. MOBTJ.GU dissented from the views expressed byLord Curzon and Mr. Churchill.     He had always been ofopinion that a conference with the disloyal parties would ultimately be necessary.     If this view was correct, it would be unfortunate to refuse a conference to Malaviyals deputation, only to be forced into aconference at a later date, after disturbances and blood-shed.     He proposed to make it clear to the Viceroy that parliament would not now consent to any radicalamendment of the Government-of India   Act of 1919, butG
 he did not see why extensions might not be made within the limits of the existing law. It was difficult in India for the Government to get in touch with public opinion and he believed a Conference would be the best means by which the Viceroy could explain the point of view of the Government to the people generally. The Viceroy would thus be afforded an opportunity of informing the agitators that there was no chance of any immediate step being taken towards the establishment of "swaraj". He proposed that the Viceroy should be told

(1) that the holding of a Conference should in no way be made conditional upon a favourable reception being given to the Prince of Wales at Calcutta.

(2) that the proclamation against the Volunteer; should stand, and

(3) that His Majesty&apos;s Government will not at present sanction any change in the constitution of India.

If a Conference were held in January, it would mean a period of three or four months before the resulting instructions of His Majesty&apos;s Government could be forwarded to India, and during this period the forces of disorder in India might abate.

MR. FISHER, on the whole, agreed with Mr. Montagu&apos;s suggested reply, but considered that it should be strengthened in certain respects. He considered that if the Viceroy went into a Conference it should be made perfectly clear that no extension of the Government of India Act of 1919 could be approved 
His MajWtff^&quot;^V8rnlaaM &quot;at present /&quot;-&quot;after I9iat the^we should he no bargaining over the reception to the,prince of Wales.     He vms opposed to tho release ofprisoners unless a satisfantory and oolleotivaguarantee for their future good conduct was given tothe Indian Government.     Ee was of opinion that the proclamation against the volunteers should not hecancelled.        These conditions would be thought   besafeguards against tho evils to which Jiord Curzon had drawn attention,     The extremist party in India waspowerful and increasing in strength.   They would soonproduce a definite political programme, He thought itwould bo advantageous to bring them now into contact with the Government of India.   One of the greatestdifficulties of tho government of India was thepaucity of tSae means at its disposal for making its position known to the people.MB. CHAMBBRLAIH said that he was much disturbed by the Viceroy&apos;s telegram.    The Viceroy had placed theGovernment in an exceedingly difficult position in layingbefore them, proposals of a far reaching character, towhich he was apparently already half committed, and indemanding-a-reply within twenty-four hours.     he feared that the Government of India were losing controlover the situation and were losing confidence in themselves.He was opposed to a decision being given in ahurry as to the conference, and to the conference being in any way connected with the prince of.^ales&apos; visit.
He was inclined to reply to the Vioercy that if hewas doubtful of the success of the Prince.^   visit the Prince should net go to Calcutta.     That would be equivalent to a oeneuro of the people of Calcuttawhich they had merited..His Majesty&apos;s Sovernraent should not consent tothe Conferenoe until they had been informed of theresults of tho proceedings&apos; &quot;in Ccunoil on the 20thDecember and of. the meeting with the deputation on the21st.It was desirable that the Viceroy should- be askedfullyto inform His Majesty&apos;s Government/of the scope and nature of the Conference proposed by the deputation and who was to be present at it.The general sense of tho meeting appeared tobe that, Lord Heading should be instructed that when he received the deputation on-tho 2lst December, he should inform, them that His Majesty&apos;s Government hadnot been consulted with regard to tho proposal tohold a Conference In January, and that ho was thereforeunable to comply with their request.     He shouldrequest the deputation to submit their viows as totho scope and membership of the proposed Conferenoe,and that he should forward their proposals to HisMajesty&apos;s Government for their consideration.ThG Viceroy should also inform the Deputation that HisMojostyrs Govornment- could not entertain any suggestion for the radical amendment of the Government of india act of 1919, and that no bargain should be made with
regard to the Prince- cf&quot;Wales:&quot;visit to Calcutta.CONCLUSION.That Mr. Chamberlain and Mru Montagushould prepare a telegram for despatch to the Viceroy based upon the views expressed by the majority    cf theMembers, of the Commit tee * .X*MR. MONTAGU desired that his dissent from theopinion of the major^y of the Committee be recorded.906    The Telegram is printed as Annexe IIto these Minutes*, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,20th December, 1921.

Nevertheless, there is generally throughout India, even though in many respects vague and undefined, a desire for some form of responsible Government.

But yet I do-see that the pace is quickening ; my own view at the moment is that dominion status will have to come -by successive progressive stages.Proposals at present under discussion, and which must either succeed or fail within^the next two or three days, have been made by Malaviya, but require at present the-authority of Gandhi before they can be made effective.

He asks me to receive a
deputation on the 21st for the purpose of their preferring a request to me for aconference&apos;. Any proposal for conference inevitably means a proposal to discussSwaraj, and here lies ray real difficulty. I have told Malayiya that [ will not discussthe conference unless the boycott is called oil&apos; regarding the Prince of Wales&apos; visithere and elsewhere, and that, if Gandhi and his associates make a large gesture inthis direction in a broad and generous spirit, I would respond in the same way.. This,would mean the withdrawal of the Proclamation against Volunteers, and the releaseof as many of those persons, leaders and others, who have been imprisoned fordisloyalty to this Proclamation, or for other offences during the period since the proclamation of Volunteer Associations, and this would apply not only to Bengalbut to all Local Governments. Lord Ronaldshay is in complete agreement.He has to meet his Legislative Council to-morrow, when a motion will be moved foradjournment of the House. He will, however, make a statement indicating that, ifthe non-co-operators are prepared to stop the boycott and the unlawful acts for thepurpose of bringing it about, his Government will be prepared to take the course of withdrawing the Proclamation against Volunteers, and generally of meeting the new situation in the same spirit. He will also announce on my authority that 1 havecommunicated to Malaviya that I shall be prepared to receive his deputationon 21st Uecember. You will appreciate that there is so little time thatI must act to this extent, which is, I believe, in accordance Avith your views.Lord Ronaldshay was with me this evening at an interview with Malaviya.I again made clear, at this interview, what 1 had stated to Malaviya at an earlier discussion, namehy, that it must be distinctly understood that I muststate to the Deputation that, in arranging a Conference, I am not committingmyself, or my Government, or His Majesty&apos;s Government, to accepting any of thev/iews that may be presented, and that it may be that no results will follow from theConference. J. wished him clearly to understand this at the outset, as J. must guard-against possible suggestions in the future, should the Conference prove abortive, thatthe Nou-Co-opei waters or others had been misled by my attitude. I pointed out to him that it was not in my power, and indeed that 1 would be acting contrary to my duty,if 1 undertook to make specific recommendations to.His Majesty&apos;s Government, inasmuch as I should then have compromised them. 1 emphasised that the decision on allthese questions must rest with HisMajesty&apos;s Government and the Imperial Parliament,.and that I could not, and would not, take any step without their knowledge and assentwhich would prejudice the position. Moreover, I intimated to him that, at present,I did not see my way to make any recommendations for a change, and that he oughtto know that this was my view.He begged that I should nevertheless listen to the views presented, whichprobably would not all agree, and come to my own conclusion, and not shut my minddefinitely to any representations that might be made. I canswered that I would beprepared to listen and discuss, and would then consider all the arguments placed before me, and have to report to His Majesty&apos;s Government according to theconclusions I formed as the result of all my consideration. But I insisted that mycalling of the Conference must not be taken to commit us to any course save to hear the arguments and representations. He agreed, and admitted that this was theconstitutional course, and they could ask no more than that I should consider theirarguments sympathetically. I observed that this phrase had its danger, as it mightbe taken to imply my assent to some of suggestions made, but that, of course, at such-a conference, I should desire, if possible, if I could conscientiously do it, to arrive atsome better condition of affairs.The announcement has appeared in the newspapers that Malavi3ra has been to seems, and he has communicated to the Press that his object is to ask me to receive adeputation requesting a conference.I have called a meeting of my Council, which will meet here on the 20th, in orderthat 1. may cany them with me in my action. I have no doubt they will agree. TheIndian members particularly are pressing me very strongly to stop the prosecutions-and to call the conference.I am also sending telegrams to the Local Governors informing them that I shall receive the deputation and of the suggested course to be taken. I am not sure thatall will approve the release and withdrawal of proclamation on the conditionssuggested, but I am quite clear that some such step is inevitable, and particularlyhere in Bengal. Indeed, it would be absurd of Governments to continue to enforce a law which rouses such strong opposition when the immediate object of the proclamationcan be attained by agreement making for peace.
IllTelegram just received from Jamnadas Dwarkadas, who had been to Ahinedabad.&quot;to see Gandhi, that Gandhi agrees to attend Conference and makes no conditions. I-am still awaiting Gandhi&apos;s answer to Malaviya respecting the Priuce&apos;s visit, and as you will understand the present proposals centre upon the better conditions for the prince&apos;s visit.I am most anxious to receive His Majesty&apos;s Governments approval to this course.So far, I am committed only to receiving the deputation on the 21st, which will be-announced by Lord Ronaldshay to-morrow afternoon in his Council. But nothingcan happen and no arrangement can be made unless I agree to call a conference in answer to the deputation on the 21st. You will observe how short the time is,and how much will be left to be done between that date and the 24th, when the prince arrives ; and I beg, therefore, that you will most urgently send mean answer atonce, especially as I have many other arrangements to make in connection with thismatter. ,If you have difficulty in getting a Cabinet decision, I hope you will get that ofthe Prime Minister and others whom you think of greatest importance in Indian-affairs. Please remember that the Irish situation has given tremendous impetus tothe movement here for conference.   All parties of Indians seem to agree in desire for-conference as way out of present difficulty. I fear that, if I refused it, the effect would be to break down the whole Reform Scheme, for I think the various councils and the Legislative Assembly would undoubtedly pass resolutions to this effect.Please also bear in mind the position of my Indian colleagues in the Council. i cannot, myself, see any fserious objection to the course, I am proposing, provided weobtain the change of attitude regarding the Prince of Wales&apos; visit, which will quitealter the atmosphere and relieve the tension, and is an essential condition.Throughout, I have borne well in mind the position of the British here, as well as the indians.Of course yon may xise any parts of this telegram you choose, but do not make-any public announcement till you hear from me.
From Secretary of State to Viceroy, 20th December 1921.Clear the line.Private and personal. Most urgent. Your private and personal telegram of 18thDecember, received last night at a time when the Government is deeply pre-occupied with an International Conference. I am sure that you will realise the great difficultyin which the Cabinet is placed when it is consulted on so grave a question and requested to give an answer in 24 hours. We have no opportunity of seeking the further information or explanations from you which we should desire before giving our decision.In this case your telegram leaves us in some doubt how far you have already committed yourself by your conversations with Malaviya or others; but we assumesince you ask our opinion that at this stage, you are still free to assent or dissent from the summoning of the conference as may seem best to you after to-morrow&apos;sdeputation. On this assumption we proceed to state how the proposal for a conferencestrikes us.(1) We fear that it would be difficult to reconcile the reception in conference ofthose who have failed to secure, or refused to secure, election to the Legislature, withthe proper respect owing to the members of your Legislature. I say this although itappears that your Legislature would welcome such a conference.(2) More important still, we cannot see how it is possible to prevent such aconference from developing into a simple demand for swaraj, and for scrapping ascheme of Government approved by Parliament only two years ago and in operation for less than one year. My colleagues felt that mere formulation of such a demand bya conference summoned by you would be au act of grave moment, and would greatlyweaken your power of resistance and strengthen the dissatisfied and disaffectedelements. If the conference were of a kind likely to produce a settlement satisfactory to you and to us, much might be said for it, but failure to secure agreement or a formal demand for impossible terms would leave us in a worse position than now.The Cabinet held that a conference which fails is infinitely worse than no conferenceat all.I must not leave you in any doubt that it would be impossible to recommend toParliament, after one short year&apos;s trial, to extend the Government of India Act, 1919,and I notice that, as at present advised, you see no necessity or cause for such anextension. What is required is that within the four walls of the statute, Indiansshould take advautage of their new opportunities as they would appear to have donein this last year, so that they can come in due course to Parliament, and base their claims, not on demands which were considered so recently, but on actual work cloneand actual conventions of political life established, and it may well be that within thescope of the present Act these opportunities could be further extended.In discussing proposal for a conference you cannot mean, I imagine, to make itconditional upon a welcome to the Prince of Wales. Any idea of such a bargainwould, it seems to us, be most improper and certain to have unfortunate consequencesin the future. You can, of course, make it quite clear that a conference would beimpossible if the Congress leaders and those who follow their lead were breaking thelaw and necessitating prosecutions or even actively indulging in hostile demonstrations,and that a conference would only be possible in an atmosphere of peace. Even theappearance of using the Prince as the consideration for a bargain must be avoided.I come now to the release of prisoners and the withdrawal of the proclamationsagainst volunteers. I find it difficult to agree to the release of prisoners except on an understanding that they will, on release, abstain from those activities which render them liable to prosecution, and with a clearly expressed determination that they willbe prosecuted again if there is any repetition of the offences for which they are nowimprisoned, but bargains with individual prisoners are useless unless supplemented by undertakings from those who are in a position to direct their actions. Further, itseems to me impossible to say that because you have assented to come into aconference, institutions which you regarded as illegal yesterday you now regard aslegal, which would be the result of the withdrawal of the proclamations. the proclamations could only be withdrawn if it were shown that the volunteerassociations had ceased to be dangerous to the public order, or if their members had ceased to commit breaches of the law. That is to say, the proclamations could onlybe withdrawn on an undertaking that military drilling and interference with public order and with the liberty of the public or of individuals would cease to be practised.I am sure I need not remind you to consider the position of Local Governments andprotect their prestige in whatever action you may decide on.
