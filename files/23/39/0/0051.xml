1. The Secretary of state for foreign Affairs statedthat it was desiratio that we should secure the evacuation of the refugees at Smyrna he fore Septembor 30th;   If, as was stated in that morning1 a newspaper, the number leftwas only about 15,000, it Should be possible to do this.It was important to consider what would happen to these refugees on their arrival in Greece.   Mr. Lindley had suggested that an Inter-Allied commissioners si on should be setup at Athens to arrange for the relief of the refugees^and that this might be done through the League ofNations.It was agreed  That the Seoretary of State for ForeignAffairs should telegraph to Lord Balfour,asking him to Invite the League ofNations to set up maofa inory to deal withthe relief of tho refugeos in Greece.
THE GRECO- 2.   The Secretary of State for Poreign Affairs statedTURKISHSITUATION.     that that morning&apos;s telegrams contained no information which was not before the Conference on the previous evening.As to the Situation in Athens, it - was alleged that theCrown Prince had been accepted hy the revolutionaries asKing, but he (lord Gnrzon) had no knowledge of his policy or v/hether he intended to recall M. Venizelos .   It wasundesirablefor us to recognise the Crown Prince as Kingimmediately, as had b^en,.suggested by Mr bind ley.    It wasnecessary to receive further information as to the situation,and that we should act in concert with our Allies in thismatter.    It must be rememberod that the Crown.Prince was an unsatisfactory person &quot;and had,  on a previous occasion,been rejected in favour of his younger brother Alexander.
3. The Prime Minis-fcejjv remarked that the despatch ofM. Franklijn-Rouillon had made an atid^tloriaX complicationin the situation. -The Turks believed that he was bringing them offers of further concessions from tho French Govern-raent, and they were therefore delaying their answer to theAllies&apos; proposals until he arrived.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs statedthat the French Government had denied that Mi. Franklin-Bouillon was offering any concessions, and had said thatthe object of his visit was only to promote the executionof the Paris agreement.   While he (Lord Curzon) was in Parislast week,. M. Franklin-Bouillon had sent him a message tothe same effect, and he was disposed to believe him.   TheItalians viewed the Franklin-Bouillon mission to Kemal Pashawith suspicion, but he had raised no objection to it.The Prime Minister expressed doubt as to whether m.Franklin-Bouillon would loyally support the execution ofthe Paris agreement.    It was probable that   no might placevarious interpretations upon the terms of the agreement, and give undertakings as to what France would do in certain eventualities.   His previous proceedings in connection withthe agreement with kemal must be remembered.   At thatytimethe French Government said that his mission was of a purelyprivate character.   It was desirable that General Haringtonshould get into personal communication-with Kemal at theearliest possible moment.The Secretary of State for War read -arprivate tele-gram from General Harington to Lord Cavari (No,2485) regarding a proposal which ho vas laying before the Government in atelegram which was now being deciphered.   It was evidentthat he proposed to allow the Keraalist forces to enter Europeby crossing tho 3-e.a of Marmora.iThe Prime Minister pointed out that the situation had completely changed within the last few days.   Admiral deBrook had said that&quot; he would he unable to prevent the Keraalisto-5-
ti 9 jLfrom crossing into Europe if Constantinople wsre evarcuated.&apos;If the Ksmalist forcos crossed into Europe, that would meanwar between Pricey and Greece.   We had handicapped the greeks by preventing their transports from going to Rodosto.It waS important that we should be neutral spedtaters in anysuch war; and if the Kemalists crossed the neutral zone weshould not prevent the Greeks from crossing it.The Prime Minister then briefly reviewed our transao*-tions with Kemal Pasha.   We had repeatedly granted him eon-&quot;cessions, and had threatened him that if he violated theneutral z*ne his troops would be fired on.   When his forcesviolated the neutral zone they were not f tread on.   His troops were reinforced;   we gave him an ultimatum;   the time of the ultimatum was extended, and his troops now remained in theneutral zone and we had not taken any aotion against them *The Situation had completely changed since the agreement made by Lord Curzon in Paris on the previous Saturday,   Itmust be remembered that the Greek Navy and Army, which hadrevolted, had done so with the object of fighting for theretention of Eastern Thrace.The Secretary of State for the Colonies stated that ifKemalist forces entered the neutral zone It would be a viola- .tion of the Paris agreement, which would thereby come to anend.   It was true that we could not prevent Kemalist forces from entering Europe, but we must not acquiesce in such action.In the agreement we had consented - subject to certain conditions - to the peaceful establishment of Turkish rule in Eastern Thrace.   These conditions would be flagrantlyviolated if Kemal broke riotously into europe.   We had saidthat we should not assent to the free passage of the Turkish forces into Europe with the object of extending the area ofthe war, and we should adhere to that position.   A furtherImportant part of the agreement was the provision for theprotection of the minorities&quot;in Thrace.
The Secretary of State for Poreign Affairs suggest-ed.that too much was being read into Sir Horace SumboWstelegram No.469.   He pointed out that we had agreed inParis that we should endeavour to secure the withdrawal ofthe Greek troops behind a line to be agreed upon by theAllied Generals.    The Allied Generals had adopted the maritza line, which was originally suggested by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.    They now proposed that that line should beagreed to and a temporary administration should be set upto replace the Greek administration, pending the establish-ment of a new Turkish Government.It was agreed that the establishment of a temporarycivil administration in Thrace to replace the Greeks, ifthey consented to withdraw, was not practicable.The Lord Privy Seal pointed out that there were threecontingencies:-(l)  That Kemal accepted the Allied conditions and the Greeks  re fused thorn.:(ii) That the Greeks accepted the Allied condi-tions and Kemal r&quot;faced them:(iii) That both Kemal and the Greeks accepted theAllied conditions.Contingency (i) would place us in a difficult position inregard to Kemal.    If we asked the Greeks to withdraw to the maritza line and th**y declined to do so and proceeded openlyto organise resistance to a Kemal1st advance, Mustapha Kemalwould probably enquire if we were prepared to evict the greeks from Eastern Thrace.   We should refuse to do so, andhe would then request us to allow his troops to enter Thracein order that he might do so himself.   It would be difficultto refuse such a request.The Secretary of State for the Colonies pointed out thatif we allowed Kemalist forces to enter Thrace while theKemal 1st troops were infringeing the neutral zone, that wouldbe to enforce the- Paris agreement as against the Greeks, butnot to compel the Turks to comply with terms that were un-favourable to them.   He suggested that the proper answer to
Kemal would be that &quot;So long aa you are in conturaa-ciouaoccupation of tbe neutral zone we snail do nothing to carryout the Paris agreement&apos;&apos;.   On the withdrawal of the Kemalisttroops from the neutral zone, we should request the Greeksto withdraw behind the Maritza line in Thrace.   If they refused to withdraw we should inform the Kemalists that wewould open a path to them across the Sea of Marmora, andshould similarly allow the Greeks a free hand for the move-ment of their transports and warships in the Sea of Marmora. -The Prime Minister reminded the Conference that theBritish Pmpire had two interests in the Near Eastern question.Firstly, peace.   We did not propose to use force to establishpeace between the Turks and the Greeks^ but the whole of our influence would be direct-&apos;d towards securing peace.    Cursecond interest was the establishment and maintenance of thefreedom of the Dardanelles for the nations of the world,under the League of Nations;   To secure.that object we wereprepared to use force, and to occupy both sides of the Dar-dardanelles.    If necessary, we should defend the Dardanellesalone.   We had ma do a public announcement to that effect,and if we receded frot. that position we should humiliateourselves before tbe whole world, Eos tern and Western.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs suggestedthat a third British interest was the maintenance of ourrelations with our Allies, as it was clear that no peaceful solution of the Eastern question was possible unless England,Franco and Italy were in agreement.The Lord Chancellor expressed the opinion that we oughtto resist at Chanak as long as It was possible to do so.If driven from Chanak we should withdraw to Gallipoli.   Hewould have no hesitation in meeting Parliament on that issue.We had issued ultimata to the Kamalists, and our policy wasperfectly clear.-G-*
The Secretaryof State for War pointed out that if itwas decided to resist the Turks it must he realised thatmobilisation would be necessary, and. it was important thatmobilisation should not be-unduly delayed&apos;.:  A promptdecision must be taken when neeeesaryoIt was suggested that the following action should betaken:-   That Mustapha Kemal should be requested to Witb-draw his troops from the neutral sone.    When they had wih-drawn, the Greeks should be requested to withdraw behind the line of the Maritza in Eastern Thrace,    If the Greeksrefused to withdraw, we should inform Kemal that his troops would be allowed a passage into Thrace across the Sea of marmora.
(At this point the Chief of tho Naval Staff,the Chief of the Imperial Central Staff,and the Chief of the Air Staff entered theroom,)The Secretary of State for War read telegram No .2485from General Harington.The Prime Minister pointed out that it was evidentlyproposed to clear the Greek Fleet out of the Sea of Marmora.Admiral       Brock had ordered the withdrawal of Greek warshipsfrom Constantinople, and had stopped Greek transports fromlanding troops at Rodosto.    The &quot;Greeks were superior at sea and the Turks were superior on land.   Mr Lloyd George then,read telegram No.467 from the High Commissioner, in whichhe proposed that Greek ships should leave the Sea cf Marmora.The proposal in telegram No.2485 was in effect that theGreek ships, having been removed from the Sea of Marmora,the Turks should be allowed fr^n&amp;oia to cross it.It was pointed out that General Harington1 s proposalspostulated the refusal of the Breaks to retire behind the maritza line, and that it was probable that the Greeks, now that. King Constantino had abdicated, would resist the oecu-pa tion of Eastern Thrace hy the Turks.   Unless the GreekFleet could stop the passage of the Sea of Marmora, Kemalisttroops might he in Thrace within a few days.In r&quot;!ply to an enquiry hy the Prime Minister, the first sea Lord stated that the Greeks had sufficient naval forces to prevent the passage of the Marmora by transports.
A question was raised as to whether we could send General Harington independently to meet Kemal Pasha.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs stated that there was nothing in the Paris agreement to prevent us from arranging for General Harington to meet Kemal Pasha without the concurrence of France, but out of loyalty to our Allies he (Lord Curzon) would inform France and Italy if such a meeting was arranged.

The Prime Minister reminded the Conference that the new feature in the situation was the revolution of the Greeks, which had been carried out by men who would not take advice from us to withdraw from Thrace. It was certain that the Greeks would demand some better guarantee of the safety of the Greek population in Thrace than that offered by Kemalist gendarmerie. It was possible that they might ask for an Allied occupation. It was undesirable that anything should be discussed at the Conference at Mudania beyond the preliminary agreement for keeping the peace pending the assembly of the proposed Conference.

It was suggested that a telegram of encouragement should be sent to General Harington assuring him of the support of the Government and expressing appreciation of his remarkable, forbearance in the overwhelming difficulties that confronted him through the presence of a superior force against him and the tangle of the diplomatic situation.
