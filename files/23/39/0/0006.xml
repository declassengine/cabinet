*AN3)UM BY (1)   With reference to their discussion on the preceding-.:odesoi.day, the Conference met to consider a memorandum by Dr,Addison (13/B/9 (1)  ) on Housing Policy, and a draft of theannouncement to be made by the Minister of wealth, revised in accordance with the decisions of the Conference (13/B/9).,&quot;Jr. Addison explained that the formula proposed by him was given in the first paragraph on page 2 of his memorandum0He had examined $ in consultation with the officials of theMinistry of Health, those cases in which it could fairly be said the Government were committed.    The number of housesaffected was at least 35,000, the annual loss to the state in respect of these would depend on the course of prices for building - taking a figure of ;Md per notice as against 60 the present figure of annual loss, the annual charge wouldbe  1,4 00,000,     The figures given in his memorandum were supplied by the Ministry of Health.The Conference were informed that the Prime Minister .had this morning approved the revised draft answerprepared by the   Minister of Health (13/8/9), andhad expressed the view that no alteration should be madein the number of houses allowed by the i?i.aanoe Committee.It was therefore impossible for the Conference to go beyond the Prime Minister.1 s view and the decision both ofthe finance Committee and the Cabinet.V)r. Addison stated that although his view disagreedwith that of the finance Committee, ho wished itto be put forward.     The particular point on which he saw difficulty was, what would be done with.thoseundertakings which, were in excess of the figure of176,000 houses, but to the carrying out of which theGovernment were, in his opinion, pledged ?     To dealwith this point he had drafted the following paragraphwhich should, in his opinion, be included in the Ministerof : eolith1 a announcement-1-
&quot; The.. Government reoognjiaaac the rrtal. need--&apos;-for reduction of public expenditure in their reviewof departmental Estimates have given carefulconsideration to those relating to housing^ and tothe difficulty which attaches Jo adjusting asufficient effort to satisfy the vital need of thecommunity in this matter to the equally vital need&quot;of economy.It appears that in most districts, contracts for&quot; house building have been entered into, which..   will keep the industry fully employed for at least a year.       Further, in this time of falling pricesit is evident that great caution should be exercised in entering into additional commitments, so that- whilst all obligations to which the Government mayfairly be regarded as committed with LocalAuthorities must be honoured, it is proposed thatthe work, save in special cases in connection withsuch.obligations should be spread over a longer period, and unless other arrangements can be made inthe meantime, it is proposed that an additional twoyears should be allowed for this work.       Duringthis time every effort will be made in concert with ..those concerned, to limit the cost to the utmost possible extent, and to foster such&apos;conditions aswill encourage the resumption of house building by private enterprise.&quot;Objection was raised to the terms of the aboveparagraph as it was not considered to give a sufficiently clear indication of the Government&apos;s policy in regard to future building, Local Authorities, it was maintaaiw&quot;wished to know definitely whether they should continuebuilding.       They did.not wish to be left in suspensewith large staffs and plans for housing;operations.
They did not care -whether- they huali^Jhouses-or-not, but&apos; -if they were ultimately not allowed to &quot;build houses * they&apos;.wished to be toldxr.ow,.regards the woTd-^O.M^J^s^^^It was represented that the Government- were not committeo.to anything.     Local Authorities were merely. Government.,- ,       -in effectagents.     The land they had &quot;bought- belonged/to. the   -&apos; - &apos;. -&apos;Government, and the. loss arising -from re-sale-w^uld- fallon the Government. *     Ail that Local Authorities wbreresponsible, for was the penny rate. .It was pointed out that the -question was princij^vally one of form and not of substance, since the deci-sic&amp;of the Finance ^Committee would take no practical; effect until the middle of 1922.       It was therefore important-&apos; hat the proposed announcement should not indicate acomplete change of policy and give the impression that *the Government were, suddenly dropping the Housing policywhich they had so strongly supported- up-till- now-.     Itwas therefore urged that the form of the statement&apos;&quot;shouldbe recast, and that a new introduction should be draftedon the following lines:-(l)   A statement of the number of houses built andof the work effected under the Housing Schemes,(2)   A statement that at the-present time houses under contract were sufficient. to afford work forall available labour and a. considerable number of ex-service men for a period of at least one year,(3)   A statement that the Government had thereforeperformed at great cost, a work of national importance, which the private contractor was whollyunable to perform.
(4)   A statement that prices were now falling, andpossibly before a year had elapsed the privatecontractor might be able to resume normal work.The Government had therefore^ decided that for thetime being, at any rate, expenditure must belimited.       The rest of the statement would thenfollow on the lines suggested by the Minister ofHealth.It was        *-     pointed out that to omit allreferences to Fananoisij^onsiderations would be to concealthe real reason for the change of policy..     This- reasonwas well known to the public and to the Local Authorities.The policy would never have been changed but for thedecision to reduce Estimates by twenty per cent. &apos;   The profor 1922-23Visional Estimates of the Ministry of Health/had allowed for an increase of  3,000,000 or  4,000,000 in the housingexpenditureeit would be insincere and politically impossible to pretend that the announcement was causedby anything other than finanbial stringency.     Moreover,if a particular Authority claimed that it desired to erect additional houses and that it could provide thelabour and materials, there would be no adequateexplanation of a refusal of permission except on financial grounds.     It would be impossible to hide the true facts, from important Local Authorities.       It wasalsd urged that there was no breach of faith insuspending operations beyond the 176,000 houses,, sincethe loss fell on the Government, and compensation wouldbe paid for commitments entered into by LocalAuthorities with Government approval.     It would be a breach of faith to keep the Local Authorities insuspense, and instead of telling them to stop further operations at once, to advise them merely to proceedcautiously..
The Conference agreed:-(1)    That the announcement to be made by theMinister of Health should introduce in itspreamble the four points referred toJO-fi-pag-e 3   above, of this minute.(2)    That the announcement should not give any indication of a possibility of government assistance being afforded towards thecompletion of the 35,000 houses to which,, in -the opinion of Dr. Addison, the Governmentwere committed over and above the 176,000authorised by the Finance Committee.(3)    That the announcement should not attempt to conceal the fact that the country could, notface financially large schemes of expenditure-,and that it was impossible to go on with any expenditure which could be avoided.(4)    That the Conference would reassemble at.30 p.m. the same day in the room of the &apos;Minister of Health at the House of Commons,to consider the draft announcement after ithad been revised in accordance with theirpresent discussion..SLUM AREAS,   (2,)       Some discussion toox place in regard to the final paragraph of Dr. Addison&apos;s Memorandum of July 12th(13/1/9 (l) ).     It was urged that theproposal to allocate  200,000 for the redemption of slumareas was entirely inadequate, and that a contribution should be made starting with  200,000 a year in the firsttwc years and rising to a maximum cf  1,000,000 at the endof 10 years.The-opinion of the Conference was that it would beimpossible to allocate more than  200,000 per annum forthis purpose at the present time.     It was,however,suggested that in the announcement to the House of commons the Minister of-Health should refer to the government contribution as being  4,000,000, which is the capitalisedvalue of an annual contribution of  200,000,     In favour
of this view it was urged that a contribution of 4,000,000 would appear to be much more substantialthan one of  200,000 per annum and would thereforebe much more acceptable to labour.     On the otherhand the reference to a large sum such as  4,000,000would, it was thought, give rise to accusations ofwaste on the part of the Government.     It would,therefore, be preferable from a political point ofview to refer to this contribution towards slumclearances as a grant of  200,000 per annum/-The Conference agreed:*That in the, announcement to theHouse      Commons,-the Minister ofHealth .shsuld- describe the contri*bution towards slum clearances asan annual grant of  2^0,000.and should make no Reference to---the&quot;capitalised&apos;value of this sum.2 Whitehall hardens, S,Wvl.13th July, 1921.
