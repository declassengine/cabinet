The General Staff had advised that this wasunsafe unless tho communications&apos; of these troops by railway and river were secured, which would require twoAs the Colonial Office were unwilling to more battalions.pay for the latter troops/tf;.e War Office had been unable to. consent toleave either these tvtto battalions or any other unitssuch as armoured cars and machine gun units.     Theywerej however, ready to transfer to the Air Ministrysuch troops as might volunteer for this service.     Atpresent the Secretary of State continued, the War&apos; ,-. &apos;&apos;&apos;   .&quot;&apos;&apos;-- -   orOff ice assumed no responsibility, for reinforcing/ res-cuing     any forces of the Air Ministry which might become besieged in Baghdad or elsewhere in Mesopotamia,This he regarded as an unsound position, for if troubleoccurred the British Eat ion would- certainly insist on a relief expedition and there would, bo a repetitionsiege of Gordon inof the situation at the time of the   / Khartoum.
The latest request; from the Air Ministry, Sir L,Worthingtpn-^Evans continuedi had been for the retentionof an armoured car unit in the region *sf Mosul.     Aftersummarising the strategical situation in this region and the danger   of attack by the Turks in combination with   .    Tribal risings as set forth by the general for War -Staff in CP. 3708 the Secretary of State/urged thatthere should be a withdrawal to the area about Basrah,  rthereby effecting a saving of  ^0^0,000 per anrsms cada great, reduction in liabilities.The Secretary of State for the Colonies reminded his colleagues that^,000,000 per annum had alreadybeen saved on this year&apos;s estimates and that the oostdf the whole administration of Irt&amp;q had been reduced to 7,^00,000 for the ensuing year.     The country was notat present seriously disturbed, and the actual loss in white personnel during^the last   twelve months wasonly three officers!     The policy in regard to ourposition in Mesopotamia was to &quot;maintain order by meansof native levies supported by powerful Air Forcesconcentrated in a loop of the river close to Baghdad.,also &quot; order,where/then! or forces&apos;would maintain /    in the year1923-24- it was hoped to reduce the cost to  3 - 4,000,000a year.     By that time it was not unreasonable to anticipate that trade would begin to develop in these,regions.    &quot;Mr. Churchill made it perfectly clear thatthe permanent arrangements as described above were .insufficient&quot;; to resist an invasion by the Turks, butthere was no evidence that an   invasion was oon&amp;fcmplatedduring the&apos;next two months.     Ultimately it was hoped-      &apos; **
to maintain the position hy strengthening the Arabsystem against the Turkish system,.     The Arah levies rv/hieprovided a screen between Mosul and the Turkishfrontier, were not as yet a force to he relied on for serious resistance, though they had been engaged inminor operations.     After reference to the difficulties and delays in arranging with the War Office for the ancillary services required in Mesopotamia, by theRoyal Air Force the Secretary of State for the Coloniesstated that he was prepared,  If the Cabinet insisted,to come out of Mesopotamia, hut his Advisors were unanimous that- the situation might he maintained bythe policy summarised above.     As we had already spentso much in Mesopotamia he considered it,would be apity to:give it up at present when we were in sight ofestablishing an independent Arab State and of fulfillingour obligations, under the Mandate we had accepted.then .&apos;   . ...       -: ...It was/pointed out that an immediate withdrawal of thoforces from Mosul would Increase, the arrogatee of the kemalists-and.prejudice the position of the foreign secretary at the forthcoming Paris Conference where itwas hoped to arrange terms acceptable to both Turksand Greeks.;      If the result cf the Conference was satisfactory the danger of Turkish attacks on Northern^csopot ami a. would he renoved and ite time would be .given for &quot;the Arab Army and levies to develop.The Conference noted that the&apos; War Office objected to the Air Ministry raising ground troops since,unnecessary duplication of Army units would thereby/ be involved;    attention was however drawn to the fact
that the Colonial Office maintained forces in Africa ever -which they had. complete centrel end it was suggested thata solution, might be found by the Colonial Office raisingsome s;eecial units of gendarm-rib for the maintenanceof order in Baghdad.and ether places in the vicinity of aerodromes 9After seme further discussion the conference agreed that:(1)    Provision should be,made in the Iraqestimates for 1922/25 for two whitebattalions, or their equivalent  (inaddition to the four Indian battalions)*(2)    The Ear Office should render everyassistance to. the Air Ministry in the taking over by the Air Ministry of suchunits and individuals of the army ancillary services as might he required by theRoyal Air Eorce,(3)    Part of the existing garrison and armoured car Company should&quot; remain at Mosul and thetwo white battalions at Baghdad until theconclusion of the forthcoming Conference onthe Turco-Greek Peace,.
