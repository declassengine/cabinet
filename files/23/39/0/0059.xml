APPENDIX.3 tth - Hover&quot;! b er, 192 3 .Sir,I am directed by the Prime Minister to acknowledge the receipt Cf your letter of the 18th Instant in whiohyou again&quot;request that he should receive a deputation ofunemployed wha have come to London from the Provinces inorder to lay their grievances before the government.The Ministers primarily responsible bar dealing withthe alleviation of unemployment are the Ministers ofLabour and Health.    Both Ministers being if.ambers of theCabinet are fully empowered to act on behalf of theGovernment and have expressed their readiness to receive a deputation.   If their answer is deemed unsatisfactoryit can be challenged in the constitutional manner and place, namely, by raising the question in Parliament.In these circumstances the Prime Minister is unable to depart from the decision already communicated to you, andhe again suggests that you should place yourselves in communication with the Ministers concerned.I am to add that the Prime Minister is fully conscious of the hardships which the present economic situationinflicts en large numbers of men and women throughoutthe country, and the Government is addressing itself tothe consideration of every possible remedial measure.Yotirs truly,(Sde) RONALD WATERHOUSE.
