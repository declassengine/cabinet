(C.P.3463).Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor War.  (CP,3474).THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs informed the Conference that he had only that&apos;afternoon received a reply from the FrenchGovernment to the British Note on this subject.On the reply in question, which was very long,pacific and courteous, depended the future ofthe Entente and it -vsould require the most carefulconsideration.,     In the meantime and until this reply/
reply could ^ ^ he did not thinkany useful purpose would be served by discussing &quot;thesubject.It wss agreedTo postpone further consideration ofthe question until such time as ministers had had an opportunity of reading the reply from the French Government whichthe Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs undertook to have translatedand circulated..5.       With reference to Cabinet 86 (21), Conclusion 1.the SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS called attentionthe the urgent importance of considering further thequestion of the Situation in Egypt and the negotiations with had been taking place with the Egyptian Delegation.He reminded the Conference of the previous discussion which had taken place in&apos; the Cabinet on the two alternative proposals &quot;A&quot; and &quot;Bn when it had been decided to adoptthe former, although he, personally, had been in favourof going a little further than his colleagues andadopting proposal &apos;&apos;B&quot;.      In consequence of this decisionAdly Pasha had been informed of the reply of the BritishGovernment, and the Egyptian Prime Minister had two dayspreviously, handed him a written reply which amounted toan absolute refusal to agree to any of the Cabinet1sterms.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS then read to the Conference a note which he had prepared on the reply of the Egyptian Delegation to the proposals of His Majesty1Government, and which is given In Appendix 1*      Thesubstance of the cabinet proposals had appeared in the &apos;&apos;*&quot;Daily Herald&quot; and this had no doubt been communicatedto that paper by one of the Egyptian Delegation.     He wasto see Adly Pasha again on the following day and It wasthe present intention of the Delegation to leave london on Sunday., which would be tantamount to informing theworld/
world of the breakdown-of the negotiations.      this might, he thought, result in the creation of a veryserious situation in Egypt*     Lord Allenby took the viewthat he would be able to cope with any situation thatmight arise, unless the Egyptian Army were disaffected,in which case he would require considerable reinforcements..A telegram had been received from Lord Allenby(Appendix IT), giving the views of some of his Adviserson the Cabinet^ proposals,    and pointing out that theywere unanimously of opinion that these would be unacceptable and administrative chaos in Egypt wouldresult.      It might be said that the telegram conveyedthe frightened warning of people on the spot, but itappeared likely that we were on the vo;.rgQ of a seriousnew emergency in Egypt which might strain our-available resources to the utmost*      It remained to be seen what attitude the Press would take up, but it was doubtful if the Government&quot;s policy x?ould be supported.      ^t was essential that the Cabinet should realise the seriousness of the situationcIn the subsequent discussion which took place itwas suggested   that the only way of dealing with a serious situation such as&apos;that which had arisen   was by ensuring that departmental officials took great care when draftingtelegrams tc give in full the arguments which bad ledHis Majestyl8 Government to arrive at their decisions,.It was pointed out that the Sultan had wanted to adjourn the negotiations, and that possibly this would have been thebest way of softening the blow.      Moreover, if a finaldecision had been postponed Zaghlui might have beendeported in the meantime.     Attention was called to thefact that the Press had net been fully instructed inthe situation and that from the telegrams which had beenreceived it did not appear likely that the egyptians would accept proposal &quot;B&quot; any more than proposal ,:A,r,and that the only way of settling the matter was to adhere to/
to a policy of firmness^,and -adroitness.&apos;Ahe Secretary of State for India thought it extremely desirable that if possible something shouldbe done to gain time as the breakdown of the negotiations would be most unfortxmate.     Prom what had taken placehe thought it was evident that neither proposals wouldbe acceptable to the Egyptians.      It appeared to him that we were adhering to no clear principles and he thoughtthat it was necessary to draw a clear distinction betweenany action taken in the interests of the British empire which could not be abandoned gnd any action of abenevolent and paternal kind taken for the good of Egypt,e.g. Judicial nnd Financial Commissioners, which mightbe abandoned if the Egyptians desired.     He, suggested thatat the same time the solution might lie in the Egyptiansbeing given self-government and being told at the sametime that the Army must remain there for the protectionof British interests.     SuoAi a decision might be softenedby saying that the location of the garrisons would befurther considered in a few years&apos; time when it was possibleto see how the new arrangements worked.It was suggested that ^ord Allenby had failedto convey clearly to his Advisers the decision arrivedat by the Cabinet and the reasons which had led tothe decision being come to,  and It was asked whether there was not room for further explanation to those concerned of what had happened.Attention was called to some criticisms which hadbeen recently made of the treatment of Egyptians byEnglishmen in Egypt, and how an unfavourable compsrisonhad been drawn between the way in which the english and French treated the people in the territories whichthey administered^     Emphasis was laid on the fact thatif/
if the Government were weak in-deal ing with the Egyptiansituation, they were not fit to run a great Empire,and attention was called to the success with whichthe French administered Algeria and even Morocco,and kept the inhabitants contented without even goingso far as the Cabinet wore prepared to go in the caseof Egypt, and further,  that the French were ahleto raise in those territories large bodies of   troops to fight for Frances-Some discussion ensued as to the situationwhich might arise in the immediate future, and the atti-tude of the Press at home, pending such time as theCabinet*s explanation could reach Egypt.      It was argued that there was noreason to bo afraid of any criticismswhich might be made by the press on the Cabinet&apos;s proposals and that if anything they might bo criticised for goingtoo far.      It was pointed out that public opinion inEngland would veer round very considerably when it was known what the Cabinet had offered.Views were expressed as to the steps which shouldhe taken to interview representatives of the Pross orto issue a communique, and it was agreed  rAiat the   Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs in consultation with the prime minister should :-
(a) Prepare for. despatch to Lord Allenby, for communication to the Sultan a note containing afull explanation and defence of the position which,His Majesty&apos;s Government have assumed.(b) Prepare a communiqxie to the Press statingthat the publication of the proposals of HisMajesty&apos;s Government and the reply of the egyptian delegation will take place shortly and thatpremature or piecemeal disclosures in the interimshould be discredited,(c) Inform Lord Allenby by telegraph that a copyof proposed agreement has been forwarded to him and would no doubt be forwarded by Adly Pasha tothe Sultan, and that in the course of a day ortwo a note for communication to the Sultdn containing a full explanation and defence of the position whichHis Majesty&apos;s Government have assumed would be forwarded and that it was then proposed that thedraft agreement together with the note and the reply of the Egyptian Delegation should be publishedsimultaneously in both countries., Whitehall Gardens, S,W,19th November, 1921.

A P PE JSf D I X. I.EGYPTIAN   NEGOTIATIONS.NOTE *n the Reply of the Egyptian Delegation to the Proposalsof His Majesty&quot;s Government.ADLY PASHA called upon me yesterday at the foreign office in order to hand to mo the reply of the Egyptian delegation to tie proposals of His Majesty&apos;s Government with regard to&apos; thefuture of Egypt.As I had Warned the Cabinet, his reply, which was a typedpaper of several pages, was a categorical and uncompromisingrefusal, which he sooompanied by an expression of profoundregret that except in the single particular of foreign represent-sentation (a concession whioh was materially qualified by theconditions attached to it) His Majesty&apos;s Government had not,as he alleged, advancer! a single step towards ths acceptanceof the views whioh he and his colleagues had spent so many months in urging upon me at the Foreign Office.I expressed my sincere regret that our discussions, whichhad been conducted with so much good humour and good faith on both sides, had not had a more successful termination, and Iwas particularly sorry to read the words In the concluding paper of the Egyptian reply, which seemed to me of a need-lessly unqualified description.     But I did not attempt toreargue the case, nor did I suggest that in any way it should or oould now be reopened.- There were two questions, however,  of some importance onwhich, I said,i$ was desirable to be clear.     Was I,to regard the reply handed to me by the Minister as the provisionalrefusal of the delegation,  subject to confirmation by the sultan and the Egyptian Ministry, when Adly Pasha had returned
to Cairo, or was I to take this document as the final and definite refusal of the Egyptian Government as a whole?     I felt it neoessary to ask the question, because it was the sultan who had, I believed, originally suggested the delegation;it was to him that the pledge that it should be reoeived had -been given;   it was he who had selected its members; and I didnot quite see how the negotiations could be terminated without reference to him.     Accordingly, I asked whether the text ofthe reply had been communicated to the Sultan, whether he approved of it, and whether the aot of the delegation was alsothe act of the Sovereign.Adly Pasha was, I think, a little embarrassed by thesequestions, and had somewhat reluctantly to admit that, while the sultan was aware of What was being done, he had neither seen the text of the answer nor had expressed approval of its con-tents.     I more than once put the question &quot;Knowledge orapproval?&quot;   - to which the Pasha replied &quot;Knowledge, yes&quot;  but beyond that , silence.     He claimed, hov/ever, full powers for himself as Prime Minister and plenipotentiary to decide onhis own responsibility.Wanting to know vhat his Excellency proposed to do, I asked whether he would not esteem it a part of his duty toreturn and present the reply of the delegation to the Sultanpersonally.To this he replied in tjae affirmative, thus apparentlysettling the question of his return to Egypt- without immediateresignation.     He thought, he said, of leaving London at theend of the week, and of going to Paris, where he would pickup hie family, on his way back to Egypt.These considerations brought me to my second point, viz.,publication.     Both parties were, I thought,  concerned thatthere shojuld not be premature,  or piecemeal, or unofficialdivulgation./WB: -    2    -
189divulgation.     From the Egyptian point of view, I thought itwould &quot;be unfair and discourteous to publish without referenceto the Sultan       besides which publication in the absence ofAdly Pasha might prejudice his actions when he returned, andmight givo rise to Saghlul demonstrations, which he would notbe there to deal with.     Further, publication in Egypt of thefull text of both documents was impossible until the texts hadh&apos;\d time to arrive.     On the other hand, we in England were under a pledge to take no decision without previously sub-mitting our proposals to Parliament; and although this did not strictly apply to draft proposals whioh had been put forwardsubject to this condition, which had now been definitelyrejected, yet we must be careful as to the exact conditions under which publication in this country should take place.Could the Minister,  I asked, guarantee that his colleagues would not   communicate in the interim to the press, and would hesee them immediately on hitt return to his hotel, and pledgethem to secrecy, until a decision, upon which I should liketo consult the Prime Minister, was arrived at?This he undertook to do, stating that as there were only two copies of the draft agreement in existence,  both in his possession,  and both under lock and key, it    as impossible forthe text to be divulged.     Whether his colleagues will de;1stfrom talking is much more doubtful, and, I should say, from such knowledge as I possess of the Oriental character, most unlikely.     Nevertheless, he agreed that it would be best to defer publication until he had retxirnei to Cairo and presentedboth the draft proposals and his reply to the Sultan.I said that if that could be arranger., I though thatsimultaneous publication in this country and in Egypt was desirable, in order that neither partv might, so to speak,steal a march on the ether.      In publishing we should statoth t these were the proposals which; had been made by HisMajesty&apos;s/
Majesty&apos;s Government, subject to the approval of Parliament,if they had met with a favourable reception from the egyptian government.1 than satmdod the Minister on a third point.     I did not desire to press him, but oould ho tell me how the decisionarrived at would affect his  personal position when he returnedto Cairo, and whether we might hope for his continued co-operation       to which Kis Majesty&apos;s Government attaohed thehighest importance in carrying on the Egyptian Administration?His Excellency did not give an absolutely definite reply tothese quections, which were put with less precision than they appear to present in print;    but he left on me the very clearImpression that his present intention is to resign immediately upon returning to Egypt, an? that his position under any other&apos;conditions would beuntenable.     I said that I would consult thePrime Minister as to the desirability of deferring publicationuntil hia return, and then providing for a simultaneous issue,and would let him know oither personally or by letter beforethe end of the week.     There remains the further question ofwhat should be said in the press in the *Jfnterirn, in order toexplain the departure of the delegation.CHHZOW OF ZBDL33T0U.P OK SIGH OFFICE.November 16, 1921.
APPENDIX II.EGYPT.Deciphers   Lord Allenby (Cairo).17th November, 1921.D.    4.30 p,m, 17th November, 1921,R.    5.10 p.m. 17th November, 1921.No. 629.VERY URGENT.Following is memorandum referred to in my immediately preceding telegram.Begins,Adviser to Ministry of Interior, Acting financial adviser, Adviser to Ministry of Education, and ActingJudicial Adviser are unanimously of following view, thata decision which does not admit principle of EgyptianIndependence and which maintains protectorate must   entailserious risk of revolution throughout the country andin any case result in complete administrative chaos,rendering Government impossible.     It must be realizedthat the whole structure of Government Is Egyptianand that British officials are, almost exclusively,either in advisory, inspecting, or technical capacities.It ia therefore impossible to exercise any British controlwithout full- Egyptian co-operation in all branches 6fadministration,, as was shown in the spring of 1919, when an attempt   had been made to carry on Government withouta Ministry and with a considerable protion of Egyptian staffon strike./Unless
