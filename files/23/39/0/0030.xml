He had also shown it to Sir Cecil Hurst, andat&apos; his suggestion he had altered the last sentence toshow that the interval was&apos; &quot;usually&quot; and not &quot;invariably&quot;established.The Lord Privy Seal urged that the - Prime minister should include in his statement that the Soviet Relegateswould not be received at Court.     He himself was particu-larly anxious that there should be no ambiguity on thesubject, in order that difficulties might not arise1-
while tiie Prime Minister and hie colleagues were atGe noa oLord Birkenhead urged-that the Prime minister should not he asked to mention in his speech that theSoviet representative would not he received at Court. Ifthe question were raised in debate, Sir.Chamberlain wouldbe able to state this and could, no doubt, do so inoffea-aively by suggesting that the time would come when therepresentative could be received at Court.Mr * Chamber la ia said he thought the House of Commonsmight be very Insistent on this point and he ha^there-fore felt it would be bettor that it should come fromthe Prime Minister himself.Sir Cecil Hurst said that although the GermanCharge  affaires had not been received personally by theXing, he had, in fact, bean invited to Court functions.She Prime Minister said a slight -difference was contemplated ia the present case.Lord Birkenhead repeated his opposition to thePrime Minister&apos;s stating ia his original speech that theRussian Charge d* Affaires would not be received at Court.The Prime Minister thought it would be somewhatawkward to state it categorically in his statemeat-ia-ehief, when he had to meet the Soviet representatives so soon.   He did not waat to &quot;rub it in&quot; too much immedi&amp;te-ly before meeting them,   lie then read an extract from a recent speech by M.lenln, which he intended to quote iahis statement in the House of Commons the following after-noon, which was to the effect that there was no doubtthat the Communists had received a severe economic defeatand ia which the admission was made that, having set out to base their system on government by the proletariat, theexercise of Communism ia Russia had resulted from the disappearance of the proletariat ia the towns in orderto search for work and food ia the villages.
Tile extract from the. notes for the Prime Minister&apos;sspeech met with general approval.The Prime Minister asked Mr.Chamberlain and lordBlrkenhead to redraft the Cabinet Conclusion of Tuesday.March  8th - Cabinet 21 (B2), in accordance with &quot;the extract from his speech.
PROPOSED MEETING WITH M. POINCARE

2. The Prime Minister raised the question as to whether he should see M. Poincare in Paris on his way to Genoa. M. Giannini had represented to the Chancellor of the Exchequer that a meeting between the Prime Minister and M. Poincaré would arouse suspicion. He really had to chose between a meeting with the convening Powers at Genoa on April 9th and a meeting with M. Poincaré on April 8th.

 Sir Maurice Hankey pointed out that if the Prime Minister was to leave London by the early train on April 7th, he could see M. Poincaré that afternoon and yet arrive in Genoa on Saturday evening in time for a meeting of the convening Powers on Sunday, April 9th.

 Mr Lindsay saw no objection to this.

 The Prime Minister said this would appear to meet the case.

 The Prime Minister then withdrew.


GENOA CONFERENCE; CABINET CONCLUSION OF TUESDAY MARCH 28th.

3. Sir Maurice Hankey submitted a re-draft of Conclusion 3. (I) c. which was the outstanding portion on which agreement had not yet been reached. This re-draft was based on and incorporated the principal points made by the Prime Minister in reading his notes for his speech in Parliament the following day.

 Lord Birkenhead suggested adding at the end of the last sentence, a phrase to the effect that the Russian courts of justice would be reconstituted to enable foreigners to have access.

The draft as finally approved was as follows:-

"In the event of their accepting these conditions and of the British Delegates, in the course of the negotiations, concluding that the acceptance is bona fide, the British Government will, during a probationary period, receive a Chargé d&apos;affaires in London and will send a British Chargé d&apos;Affaires to Russia to facilitate the execution of the agreement. But the British Government will not grant full and ceremonial diplomatic representation to the Russia Government until experience has shown that the agreement has been loyally observed on the part of the Russian Government. The Russian Chargé d&apos;Affaires will not be received by the King nor invite to any Court function. Under the terms of this arrangement, Russian subjects will have access to British courts of justice, and British subject to Russian courts of Justice, which latter will be reconstituted for that purpose."
