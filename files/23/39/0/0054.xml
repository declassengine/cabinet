Promthis it would be seen that tha lin- behind .which the Greeks were to withdraw was to befixed by the Allied Generals in accord withthe Greek and Turkish military authorities.The High Commissioner&apos;s proposal would botantamount to a new concession to mustapha kemal atT-a time when he was flagrantly con-travening the condition in the Paris note that he should oboerve, the neutral line 4 andwould not be accepted.

He suggestedthat Admiral Brock should call the attention of theAdmirals of the other Allied PI---ts to the Paris Note and ask for their&apos; co-operation..The First Lord of the Admiralty thought- that the co-*operation of the Allied&apos; Admirals, though very valuable on.political grounds, - would he of little naval value *The Conference agreed  In regard to the proposal contained in sir horace Rumhold&apos; s telegram ITo . 479 (which, itwas noted, hid crossed Poreign Office tele-gram- No. 441) that the French and ItalianAdmirals should assist to prevent the passage in Europe of Mustapha Kar-al1 s troops, thatthe Secretary of?-State for Foreign affairs should instruct the British. High Commis-sioner formally to approach his French andItalian colleagues with a. request for assist-ance by the French, and Italian naval sauadrons .
10.    The lord ^rivy Seal stated that General Townshesiahad interviewed him that morning and had asked if heoould proceed to meet Mustapha Kemal.   GeneralTbwnshend had said that when he had recently been inParis M. Psanklin-Bouillon and M. Barthofc. had beggedhim to go   and that M. Poincare was also ih favourof his going and had urged him to go even if he received no mandate from the British Cabinet.   He(General Townohend) had said he was sure that his influence would be sufficient to restrain Mustaphafemali and that he proposed leaving for Paris that day.   The Lord Privy Seal had informed him that his previous visit to Turkey in breach of the promise that he had given verbally to Mr. Chamberlain and inwriting to the Poreign Office had placed Mr. Chamberlainin a very difficult position and without giving himany encouragement had promised to place the matter before his oolleagues.   He thought it an unsuitabletime for the British Government to send any unofficialemissary to Mustapha Kemal.The Secretary of State for Poreign Affairs saidthat M. Poincare had not mentioned General Townshendto him.The Conference agreed :-That General Townshendrs offer, made tothe Lord Privy Seal, to prooeed as anemissary of the British Government toMustapha Kemal should not be accepted.
*5 nirooM OPstraits&quot;11. The Secretary of State for Poreign Affairs suggested*tho advisability of bis preparing a Memorandum, for circula-tion to the Cabinet on what was ire ant by the &quot;freedom ofthe Straits&quot;.   This was a phrase which v/as used with differ-ent meaning by different people.    It was the intention ofthe British Government that ships should be able to go through to Constantinople without hindrance, but the deflni-tion would need very careful wording, fo^it must be rememberedthat however secure we might make the Dardanelles, no ships could get through to the Black Sea if the1 Bosphorus wascontrolled by Turkey ahd/or Soviet Russia.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that -there should be no fortifications of any kindon the Dardanelles or the Bosphoims, and that ships should always be able to get through from the Mediterranean to the black Sea.   In fact, even if 1st mandate    was. given to theLeague of Nations to guarantee the freedom of the Straits,they should not be in a position to block the Straits butshouldJ  be able to prevent any other Power from erecting fortifi-cations which oould close the Straits, and be able to de militaires-tarlse a zone of, say, 15 kilometres on each side.The Conference noted with/satisfaction thattho Secretary of State for Poreign affairs would shortly circulate to the Cabinet a comprehensive Memorandum dealing with thequestion of the freedom of the Straits and setting forth the meaning attached to this phrase by the British Government and by theAngora Government.

12. The question of the ne - d of holding a full cabinet meeting in the iranodiat? future was discussed, and it wasagreed -That the Seer eta xy should be ins true ted:-(i) To arrange for telegrams to be sent to allCabinet Ministers in the United Kingdom,asking the;.:; to be available in London, asa Cabinet Meeting might be necessary atany moment:(11) To notify tho Lord President of the Counciland the President of the Board of Educationat G-eneva that this was being done:(iii) To arrange for a private telegram to besent to the President of the Board ofTrade (in Prance) from the Lord privy seal, a3king him to return:(iv) To take corresponding action in regard toany other Cabinet Ministers who might beabroad.

The Lord Privy Seal referred to the Conclusions of,0 OONCLU-10S &quot;OP the Conference of Ministers held dn Wednesday, 3opte. her 27,7th sept em- . jfar, 1922, 1922, at 7.0 p^iru^ and requested that - a or retain alterationshould he made .The Conference agreedTo instruct the Secretary tc delete Conclusion(d) ifrom the Ophclusions o*&quot; a Conference ofMinisters held on Wednesday, 27th September,1920,^ at 7*0 p.m. (referring to the ChiefsOf Staff of the three Services a questionregarding the maintenance of communication    -or with Constantinople if Ghanak was not held).-13-
&apos;i si a).14, The Lord Privy Seal drew attention to the MinutesVjationC-:.NSTAH- of the Confer--nee of Ministers held on September 27, 1922,0VLF1.at 7 p.r     and suggested a correction.IponsibilityThe Conference took note of,  and approved,a correction to th \ draft Minutes of theConference o^ Ministers on the  7th September,1922, at 7.si p6nr., proposed by the Lord PrivySealv .uo the effect that in the event of^theevacuation of Constantinople it was for the army to provide transport and that the &quot;rar office should ascertain that the military authoritiesunderstood their responsibility in this respect.^ Trans port^ang^ent s .The attention of the Seoretary of State forWar was&quot; parti.oularly^lrw Itod tp,,, this&apos;&quot;., -

The Secretary informed the Conference that theBoard of Trade ^afe very desirous of having as muchwarning as possible   even 24 hours would be very valuable   in the event of it becoming necessary&apos; tocharter a larger quantity of shipping.The prime Minister considered that no advancewarning should be given at present to the Board ofTrade; there would be no necessity to requisitionany considerable amount of shipping unless it wasnecessary to mobilise, and after mobilisation notroops would be ready to move for a considerable numberof days.The Conference agreed  That, while at the moment no instructionscould be given to the Board of Trade inregard to any probable early demand for shipping transport, the Secretary of theCabinet should warn that Department thatduring the next two or three days officials should be in attendance, or else at hand,in case an emergency requiring the chartering of transports should arise.
JQUISTTIONING.p SHIPPING.^oposed3gram toe Dominions.16. &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;The ^Sexrretary drew attention to Paper CP.-4224,and Stated that the Colonial Office were asking for instructions as to whether- the draft telegram contauned,therein should be despatched.The Secretary of State for the Colonies was ofopinion that the time was ripe for the despatch of the telegram.The Prime Minister, who was out of the room duringthe discussion, but to whom the Secretary reported onhis return, considered that the telegram should not besent off at present.The Conference agreed  That the moment had not yet arrived for sending the draft &quot;telegram to the Domin-ions, attached to the Memorandum of theSecretary of State for the Colonies, inregard to tbe proposed draft Proclamationauthorising the requisitioning of shipping.(Paper C,P.-4224)
17.       The Secretary of State for war mentioned thevarious reports of the Near East situation which wereappearing in the daily press.-     He considered that the daily Mail Reports had been better during the last......three days.&apos;    With reference to the conclusion, atthe Conference of Ministers held on Wednesday, .27th September at 7 p.m* (Conclusion (c)  ), after consulting with his advisors he had decided thatit would be better not to write a.letter to the daily mail saying that the reports they were publishing were considered by General Harington as lifealy to havo an adverse effect on the morale cfthe troops.The&quot; Conference took note of the factthat the Secretary of State for War had decided, after consultation with hisadvisors, not to make the protest tothe Editor of the Daily Mail approvedby the Conference of Ministers at their meeting on Wednesday, 27th September,   .    :.1922 at 7 p.m. (Conclusion (c) ).(ffote..,     The Members of the Conference,discussing the matter in the absence ofthe prime Minister, rather inclined tothe view that representations should stillbe made, but the prime Minister and theSecretary of State for War discussed thematter more fully after the meeting and agreed that no action should be taken).
k 9 1&apos;1    t1 j18* The prime Minister referred, to General Harington&apos;proposal contained in telegram no.    S485   that Mustapha Kemal1 s troops should he allowed to cross the sea into Thrace outside theneutral zone and said that it would he mosthumiliating to grant such permission before Kemal had accepted any agreement of any sort.     He understood from Lord Beatty that if the Turkish nationalist forces were allowed to cross the Sea of Marmora itWould then he very doubtful if the fleet would beable to have liberty of action to pass up and. down the Straits unless the Bulair lines were adequatelydefended.The general view held -was that although no decision should be taken at present, 5^et it would, be inadvisable for the Turks   to be allowed to cross intoThrace.The Conference agreedThat in regard to General Harington&apos;proposal that Mustapha Kemal&apos;s troops should be allowed to cross the 3eainto Thrace outside the neutral zones(which had been discussed at all the meetings fen the previous day) while no final decision was taken pending a reply from Sir Horace Humbold toPoreign Office telegram Ho * 441,the general view was that theobjections, includdng the risk itwould entail to the Bulair linesunless this position was amplydefended, altogether outweighed theadvantages.(At this point the Pirst Sea Lord, the Chief of theImperial General Staff, Chief of the Air Staff,General Burnett Stuart and Colonel Bartholomew&apos;onterod,)
M POSITION AT 19The prime Minister said that Telegram Ho 4SOfrom Sir H. Rumbold disclosed a serious situation.The Turks were apparently- coming right up to the Bri.ti.iSi-position and inspecting the defences.     general harington, also suggested that hy giving way to 11&apos;emal&apos;sdemandb the neutral zone might he preserved.     This,however, was a political and not a military suggestion.The Secretary of State for War then read atelegram Ho. 3506    just received from General Haringtonwhich shewed that the Turkish cavalry were coming rightup to the British defences and that the position 6fthe British forces was becoming impossible.     It also stated that Kemal denied.knowledge of any neutral zone in the vicinity of Chan&amp;k.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff consideredthat the situation now disclosed dem-extended freshconsideration.     It was an impossible situation thatthe Turks should be allowed to remain right up to theBritish wire, and the General Staff did not think thatthe safety of Chanak could be guaranteed for a periodof three to.four weeks unless a new provisional line of safety were fixed.      This should be at least 8,000yards away, preferably 10,000 or more and if this line was adhered to the General Staff were of opinionthat the military situation could be dealt with.In the present situation if orders were given for theaTurks to be driven off, it would be/most difficult task.The prime Minister considered that the militaryauthorities on the spot had not acted up tothe orders which had been given to them.     Theyfullhad been given/authority and yet had allowed the Turkishforaes right up to their defences, and he had no- 19 -/knowledge
knowledge that any ultimatum had &quot;been issued to them.The Secretary of State for T7ar then read tothe Conference two telegrams, lbs. 2508 and 2514,which had just been received from Constantinople.These telegrams conveyed a.more hopeful view of thesituation.     General Liar don had inspected theChanak position and found it.well sited, well,wired and being extended to two further posts,Karade and &quot;vlran, which would be wired to the mainposition while two companies had been sent to Kum Kale.The Nationalist forces round Chanak were estimatedat 4,500 cavalryThey did not appear to bedesirous of fighting and were moving about with whiteflags.     The telegram,. No.2514, reported that Kemalannounced he had given orders to avoid incidents and hoped to meet General Harington who, however, was onlyproposing to meet him together with the Allied Generals.The prime Minister considered that the threeChiefs of the staff should consider the situationnow brought to light.      Kemal had moved, up nearly5,000 cavalry close up to the British wire, had occupied sites which overlooked the position andSras   in touch with the British outposts.     he considered the situation most unsatisfactory and thatKemal was prevaricating while he was bringing up ..his forces so as to be. in superior strength.     Hethought the three Chiefs of Staff should prepare a general appreciation before any definite action was taken./The Lord Chancellor
The lord. Chancellor desired to know what thethree Chiefs of Staff considered tas the meaning othe position being &quot;impossible&quot;.     He suggested,that it meant intolerable and not that it wasimpossible to maintain the militarjr situation.The Secreta.ry of State for the Coloniessuggested that the time had come for general harington to give a short ultimatum to theTurkish nationalist   troops to withdraw outsidethe neutral zone and to employ force if theydid not agree to the ultimatum.      Prom the increase,sin these forces which had. taken place it was obvious that it was an increase authorised byMustapha Kemal, ,( At this point the Conference adjournedwhile the three Chiefs of Staffprepared an appreciation of thesituation.)
When tho Conference resumed,  the First Sea lord gavetho appreciation of tho three Chiefs of Staff.$hen was no definite indication that any ultimatumhad been given- to Mustapha Kemal *    It was considered that2506in telegram No..        the word &quot;impossible&quot; meant that itwas impossible for th   existing situation to be allowed tocontinue from a military point of view, for if the Turksshould commence an offensive tho defences of Chanak wouldhe seriously menaced.   The moment had accordingly come forGeneral Harington to inform the local Turkish Commanderotitslde chanak that unless his forces wore withdrawn at a&apos;stated time fire would he opened by all.forces at the dis-Naval,Military and Air.posal of the British Commander,/ and that the British frontwould be cleared by force.    It was considered that the Turksshould be made to withdraw to such a distance that thoStraits would be safo.    Continuing, the First Sea Lord said91247.that telegram No. which had been sent to general harington the previous night, would have assured him thathe would he supported by the Cabinet if he used force to compel the Turks to retire, and it was possible that hamight have already taken the measures which the three Chiefsof        Staff now recommended.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto the fact that Mustapha Kemal said he difi not know whatthe boundary of the neutral zone was at Chanak.   It was granted that the neutral zone at Ismid had been demarcatedistwith the assistance of Turkish National- officers, but therewas nothing to show that any Turkish Nationalist of floorshad assisted to demarcate the Chanak zone.The Prime Minister was of opinion that any telegramdespatched to General Harington should express surprise thatthe Turks had been allowed to come up to the British lines in spite o- the warnings which had already been given.He considered, however, that it would be advisable for tho
First Sea Lord to draft a telegram of instructions to Genera Harington, embodying the joint appreciation which be had just given.

(At this point Mr Sylvester was called in and took down and reproduced a telegram dictated by the First Sea Lord, conveying instructions to General Harington on the lines of the appreciation by the three Chiefs of Staff.)

The Secretary of State for the Colonies considered that it would be most inadvisable for British forces to go out in pursuit of retreating Turks, and doubted the wisdom of using the words "cleared by force". He would like to see the British forces holding the hills which covered Chanak, but he thought if British Infantry moved out to clear away the Turks they might easily be entangled in a difficult position and suffer such losses as to be unable to sustain a long defence, of Chanak.

It was generally agreed that all reference to "clearing by force" should be omitted.

The Lord Chancellor suggested that the intimation to the Turkish commander should be that fire would be opened and that the order to use Naval, Air and all forces at the disposal of the British General should be conveyed only to General Haringon.

The First Sea Lord was of opinion that if the Turks thought that Naval guns and aeroplanes were likely to be used they would be more likely to retreat at to a greater distance.

In answer to a question, the Chief of the Air Staff said that he thought the Air Force would be able to stampede large numbers of the Turkish Cavalry. Unfortunatoly, there were actually present only a few aeroplanes. A large reinforcement to the Air Force from Egypt, with heavy bombers, would arrive either on the night of the 29th or the morning of the 30th September. He suggested that the air forces should be employed in following up the Turks and forcing them to evacuate the neutral zone.
It was gomTally-.. fl^pw*ed-th^ to beabort, jind that the air forces, should be used to follow-the Turks to the edge of the neutral zone.The Secretary of Stat^ for War suggested that a prefaceto the telegram-  was required, to the effect that it was obvious that Kemal was continuing to move up troops and sohem in the British forces.   He suggested various other amendments in drafting, and the telegram,with those amend-went a, was again read to the Confer-he a&apos;.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff enquired whether any instructions should be included to meet the followingsituation:    if the Turks started to withdraw when fire was opened, were they then to be allowed to withdraw unmolested,-or shotild fire be continued?    It would, he considered, bevery difficult to control the fire orce opened, except bythe man on the spot.    He suggested that if he were in commandhe would continue the1 fire until the Turks had withdrawn upa minimum of 10,000 yards.The Chief of the Air Staff drew attention to the factthat it -ticuld be very difficult for the air forces torecognise the exact moment when the Turkish forces reachedthe neutral zone.   He hoped, however,  that the air forces would be able to have considerable effect or any Turkish forces which re-entered the neutral zone.The Prime Minister considered   the action of the TurkishNationalists -       an insult to the British Empire, thatthey must be made to withdraw to such a distance that the that intelligence had been received from various sourcesstating that Kemal proposed to attack on September 30th.He suggested varioxis minor alterations in the draft telegram,Chanak position   ould be secured, ana that fresh. Turkishup into the Neutral Zonw attention to tho fact which was again read to the Conference.The Conference agreod..(see Conclusion (s).)A summary of conclusion is attached.

PROPOSED IMMEDIATE WITHDRAWAL OF GREEKS FROM EASTERN THRACE.

(f) In regard to the proposal contained in Sir Horace Rumbold&apos;s telegram no.474 of September 28th that the three Powers should inform Greece that Greek troops should immediately be drawn behind the maritza line - the proposal of the secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was approved that he should reply by drawing Sir Horace  Rumbold&apos;s attention to the sequence of events foreshadowed in the Paris note of invitation to the Conference. From this it would seem that the line behind which the Greeks were to withdraw was to be fixed by the Allied Generals in accord with the Greek were and Turkish military authorities. The High Commissioner&apos;s proposal would be tantamount to a new concession to Mustapha Kemal at a time when he was flagrantly contravening the condition in the Paris Note that he should observe the neutral line, and the moment for putting pressure on Greece would be after the line had been fixed.

GREEK WARSHIPS AND TRANSPORTS IN THE STRAITS.

PROPOSED FRENCH AND ITALIAN NAVAL CO-OPERATION IN THE STRAITS.

(i) In regard to the proposal contained in Sir Horace Rumbold&apos;s telegram No.479 (which, it was noted had crossed Foreign Office telegram No.441) that the French and Italian Admirals should assist to prevent the passage in Europe of Mustapha Kemal&apos;s troops, that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should instruct the British High Commissioner formally to approach his French and Italian colleagues with a request for assistance by the French and Italian navel squadrons.
