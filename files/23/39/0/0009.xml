th Meeting,Tj^fiTTJgSJA.    (1)    Witn- reference-to E 23^-and Cabinet 59 (21)-ConcriAiBion 3, the Conference had before them thefollowing documents relating to the position betweenthe British Empire and Prance in regard to UpperSilesiaA despatch from the Secretary of State forForeign Atfairs to Sir MiCheetham (Paris)dated 27th July 1921 (CP.3171)A translation of a Note delivered by theFrench Ambassador on July 27th 1921 (C.I,3172)The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsreviewed the communications which had recently passed between the two Governments and feave the conference a full account of his interview with the j?renohAmbassador on the previous day, in the course ofwhich lord Curzon had called attention to the serious-ness of the step threatened in the French Note and itsconsequences upon the Alliance.   He had in particularasked the Ambassador if the Note emanated from theFrench Cabinet and with the authority of theitf PrimeMinister and had received the reply that M.Briand wasin telephonic communication with his colleagues.   Afterthe interview the French Ambassador had later in theday addressed a letter to Lord Curzon in which heappeared to wish to modify the grave impression made bythe Note by indicating that the Note was intended toprevent misunderstanding and to oppose the attempt^being made at Berlin to separate the Allies..The Conference realised that the whole tone ofthe Frenah communications indicated a situagreat tension.     In particular comment was made oh, thestatement that&quot;For an ally.to oppose the despatch of reinforcements would he an act neither correctnor friendly&quot;&quot;and to the statement that&apos;v&apos;\&quot;the attitude of the British Government, ifadhered to, would lead directly to aFranco-British rupture .(&quot;conf lit&quot;) &quot;,
While, some doubt was expressed as to the precise meaning of the term &quot;coixflit&quot; it was agreed that the documentindicated at least an intention on the part of Prance toadopt in future a line practically independent of thiscountry.lord Curzon, proceeding, said that he was not without some hope from various indications which&apos;had reached him,that IvLBriand, in whose absence from Paris the presentposition of tension had developed, might        yet find someexcuse for easing the strain.    A telegram wnich had just been received from Sir M.Cheetham (Ho.538 dated July 27thhe1921) indicated that M.Briand, whom   had just interviewed,,.,had taken pains to impress on Sir M.Cheetham that it was a mistake to suppose that he had not always been in favour ofa meeting of the Supreme Council and he seemed to expect thatexpetrts would be able to meet to-day (Thursday).     The FrenchCabinet was also to meet to-day.     Lord Hardinge wasinterrupting hls: vacation and had left for Paris to-day.In Lord Hardinge&apos;s view the present situation is mainlyattributable to Li.BertheIot and it is probable that M.Briandwill adopt a more conciliatory attitude to this country.    Inthe meantime, Lord Curzoii continued, he was preparing for theconsideration of his colleagues a draft reply to the FrenchHote in the course of which he would correct the misstate-ments of fact in the French Hote, denounce its baselesscharge that we were in any way instigating the policy follow-ed In Berliffii  and contest the intolerable pretensions of theFrench Government that because certain troops were alleged tobe in peril it is entitled to send a Division to Silesiawithout not only the concurrence of the Allies, but withoutaffording the Allies an opportunity of discussing the situation-ion.     This Keply it was hoped to have ready to despatch to Paris tonight.
In the course of the discussion which followed thestatement of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairscorroboration was given of the Ambassador:s account of thochange in the attitude of the French towards the Alliancewhich in the opinion of many in France had servod its purpose, and attention was drawn to the position whichwould arise if France resumed hor indopondonco and. proceeded to send troops to Silesia   in defiance of Germany, This wouldmean the breakup of the Supreme Council and it was suggestedthat the proper course would then be to appeal to theCouncil of the league of nations as provided in the Treatyof Versailles.     In such an event it v/as not improbable that rather than face the issue France would withdraw from and break up the.league of Nations.    It was also suggested to be desirable to keep tho United States government informed of tho position as it developed, to secure thogoodwill and co-operation of Italy and Japan, and to beprepared if events moved unfavourably to make a statement in Parliament and to publish papers.The Conference agreed -(a) To adjourn until 5.30 that afternoon when lordihirzon would submit his Draft Reply tc the FrenchIToto.(b) That questions on the subject which had boonput down in Parliament should be postponed.
Conference of July 25th 1921PACIFIC (2)- With reference to E.25th Meeting and Cabinet  &apos;0OUFEREHCE.the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs statedthat he had that morning received from the JapaneseEmbassy copies of - despatches which had been exchanged between the Japanese Government and the Governmentof the United States in regard to the proposed conference on the Limitation of armaments atWashington     ^The Japanese Government emphasised the view that in the preparation of the Agenda care should be taken to avoid questions which were ofspecial interest to &quot;&quot;particular&apos; IJowers or questionswhich had already been decided.The Conference took note of the JapaneseReply and agreed that on the whole it was satisfactory.2 .7hitohall Gardens S..*,i.July 20th 1921
