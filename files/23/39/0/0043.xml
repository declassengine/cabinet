gjfJATION in  EAST.Curzon1 s3d messagejj6 cabinet.(1)The Conference had before them the message (CP, 4202 ) from Lord Curzon &apos;summarising the proceedings     which had taken place between himself, Count Sforsa and MoPoincare yesterdayafternoon, from which it appeared that as a resultof the representations made by Lord Curzon and admiral Beatty, the Prench Government were newwilling that a general Conference for the settlementof the Turkish question should now be held, andwere prepared to use their, influence with Liu s tap LaKemal to abstain from any military action whichmight imperil the success or even the meeting ofthe proposed Conference.     . Lord Curzon had made it quite clear that Great Britain was prepared, if-necessary, to act alone in the defence of theStraits and this knowledge, ,combined with the detailsgiven of the preparations which Great Britain was making with the vie?f to the successful carrying outof her policy, had profoundly influenced M.Poincareand had caused him to take up a much more conciliatory attitude. .The attention of the Conference was also drawn to a telegram from lord Hardinge (from which it appeared that the basis of the proposed conference was to be examined by the allied ministers in .?aris on Friday next.THE PRIME MINISTER thought that the newsconveyed by these messages, was of a profoundlysatisfactory character- and no doubt the delay untilFriday was due to the desire of HoPoincare andLord Curzon to consult their respective colleagues,. SIR WILLIAM TYRRELL remarked that ^ord Curzonproposed to send a further telegram giving his/views-1-
 views as to the basis of the proposed Conference but this telegram would not be received until Thursday, September 21st. (This telegram, is C.P.4203).

 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES thought that the most recent developments in no way dispensed with the necessity for sending a new appreciation of the situation to General Harington, or for pressing on in the most vigorous manner possible with the reinforcements.  It should be borne in mind that the Kamalists might refuse to accept the advice of the French and that in any case, apparently, Lord Curzon failed to persuade M. Poincare to countermand the order withdrawing the French troops from the Southern shore of the Straits.

 It was agreed:-

 (See Conclusions (a) &amp; (b)).                                                                    REINFORCEMENTS ?ansport ?ements. 

(2). (Mr. Payne and Mr. Ripwood entered the room).

 THE PRIME MINISTER informed Mr. Payne and Mr. Hipwood that the Government was very anxious to expedite as much as possible the arrival in Gallipoli of certain reinforcements which Lord Allenby had arranged to send from Egypt and it was most important to consider, without any delay, the steps to be taken to provide the necessary transport. The reinforcements, in question consisted of a regiment of cavalry, 2 battalions of infantry and a brigade of artillery and 2 pack batteries with animals for the latter. The horses for the cavalry an for the artillery could follow later but it was essential that the mules for the pack batteries should arrive in Gallipoli simultaneously with, or very shortly after, the personnel and material of the batteries.

 THE LORD PRIVY SEAL considered that suitable ships nearest to Alexandria should be requisitioned, the passenger evacuated and the ships used for transporting the troops.

 THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF enquired whether the ship


ship which was sailing on September- 24th, with ah airsquadron onboard could be expedited.    Iho squadron^ats-edfwould be ready to sail on September 22nd, hut not earlier.THE CHIEF CF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF said thatthe military details could be ready to sail on September22nd,It ws agreed(See Conclusions (c)&amp;)(d)  ).(3)     V.rith reference to the suggestion that had beenmade that General Harington should be at liberty toaccept offers made by trustworthy inhabitants of Constanttinople to assist in the defence of that City, THELORD PRIVY SEAL thought that General Harington should be advised that in accepting offers from Greeks he couldenrol the volunteers not as Greeks but a.s citizens ofConstantinople.    If this were done it would not bepossible for the Kemalists to represent that GreatBritain was giving indirect assistance to the Greekpopulation.(See Conclusion (e)  ).(4).   With reference to a Conference of Ministers onSeptember 20th, 1922, at 6,30 p.m. (Conclusion &quot;g&quot;),THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY explained by means of a map, the situation regarding the coast roads along theand the shores of the Dardanelles and Sea of Harma&apos;a.rGulf of Adramyti/ and in- particular pointed oat thatone of the roads was exposed to naval action inside theneutral area for a length of 12 miles, while the coastroad was exposed all the way.In those circumstances it seemed to him difficultto justify taking naval notion against Turkish troopsmarching along these roads outside the neutral area0The roads In question were particularly exposed to air force action.-3-       /THE LORD PRIVY SEAL
THE LORD PRIVY SEAL thought that the Naval OfficerCommanding in the Gulf of Adramyti should be instructedto give prompt information as to any movements of turkish troops but should take no overt action against suchtroops outside the neutral zone.It was agreed(See Conclusion (f)    ).
3, it5,       THE PRIMS- MINISTER read to the-Goafarreiixse^tlie^oaaowljis&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;Report, which had been drawn up that evening hy the-combinedNaval, Military and Air Staffs, and which seemed to him,to afford an excellent basis on which to proceedWe consider it essential to maintain a footing onthe Asiatic - shores both on Bosphobus end Bardan-elles until the threat materalises.The mer;i - effect of this will be of the greatest possible value.The Military force available is so small that asfar as Chenek is concerned the maintenance of thesmall force now there is all General Haringtoncan afford.We have several days in which, to decide the bestplaces to put reinforcements as they arrive, butwe consider that of the two positions Chanak isthe most important in the view of the CombinedStaffs.Meanwhile the force at Chanak will put up allthe resistance of which it is capable.THE SECRETARY OP STATE POP THE COLONIES enquired whatwould happen if on September  2nd. advaiicedHeraalist Forcescame into touch with the British SJroops at Chanak.LORE CAVAN thought that the British Troops would haveno difficulty in heating off any such attack.    A great dealwould depend, however, on the character of the attack andthe extent to which General Harington had been able tostrengthen the Chanak position, which would be much moreformidable if strongly wired.     The British could no doubthold the position for some days so long as the Turkish heavy guns did not arrive,     A resistance of the existing troops for five days would give time for the Egyptian?  re-re-inforcement,*to arrive.    Speaking purely from the military point of view he warned the Conference that the dangereusp-c&apos;r^?dwould be thetime when the Chanak Forces had been re-inforced by the Troopsnm rtv, u., , even so were too weeknow on the way and : . -   to resist the wholeTurkish Army, in which case a retirement to Gallipoli would benecessary.     The Army view was that the supports for the
Chanak Force should &quot;be retained.in Gallipoli. and.should&apos; onlyover to Ohanhkbe sent/when sufficiently strong tc hold that posxtxoarpor^-manently.     So far as he could ascertain it would appear thatthe British were holding a line of 15 alias at Ghanak, andif this was so it was clear that the vital points were being held in strength with a line of pickets over the rest of theFront,THE LORD PRIVY SEAL remarked that the substance of LordCurzonls two telegrams from Paris which ahf)y*i&apos;(3&apos; ^e cabled toSir Horace Rumbold would do much to reassure the latter andGeneral Harington,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR suggested that general harington should be told that the British Government had failed to persuade M. Poincare to assist in the defence of theSouthern shore of the Straits with French troops.At the request of the Prime Minister the Secretaryof State for the Colonies withdrew in order to draft a tele-gram to General Harington.It was agreed :-(See Conclusions (a), fb), (c), (d))6,      &apos; The Conference had before them telegrams from lord balfour Eos. 37R, 38 and 41R, respecting a proposal of Br.Hansenrs that the League of Rations should participate in relieving refugees from Asia Minor, and should appeal for -contributions to all Rations.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL reminded the Conference that whenthe Remalists had refused to allow Greek vessels to enter Smyrnafor the purpose of relieving the Greek refugees, Great britain had offered to provide British ships for this purpose, andthehad enquired whether/Greek Government would agree to the re-fugees being landed in Old Greece or on the Islands.sir WILLIAM TYREELL...
noSIR WILIIAM TYRRELL said that  &apos; * reply to&quot;that-enquiry-had so far been received.        , .THE PRIME MINISTER thought that having regard to Dr.Nansenrs appeal and the fact that the United States of Americawere finding money, Great Britain should associate herselfwith the relief measures.TBS CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER warned the conference that -unless strict precautions were taken the Greek Governmentwould repudiate any obligation to* provide for the refugees,and in the result the whole cost of maintenance might fall on great Britain.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL suggested that Lord Balfour ought tobe told that in no circumstances could any refugees be received at Constantinople.     That the British Government had alreadyenquired whether the refugees could be admitted to Old Greeceor to the Islands, and that if the Greek Government sent afavourable reply and if the kemalists still declined to allow the refugees to be transported in Greek ships,  then british shipping would be provided.     Lord Balf our should also beinformed that the British Government approved the action takenby him in agreeing at the Council of the league of Nations toa sum of 100,000 gold francs being placed at Dr. Hansen1sdisposal for necessary administrative measures, and that GreatBritain would be prepared to find a further sum for reliefpurposes provided other Powers made.appropriate contributions.Sir Horace Rumbold should be kept fully informed ofthe arrangements.  .THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER thought that  he-British contribution should not exceed  10,000.
THE ..REJ3 MINISTER felt -that Great britain could not usefully give so small a sum.   He thought that 50,000 would he a proper figure on the understanding that other nations contributed on the same basis.It was agreed See Conclusion (hi).7.       THE SECRETARY OR STATE POR THE COLONIES read totho Conference the draft of a telegram which it was proposedto send to General Harington relative to the defence ofChanak.After referring General Haringtchi to thesrimmry of the Paris di souss ions and to the revised programme of troop movements, the latter was reminded thatthe foundation, of Aritish policy is the Gallipoli.Peninsula and the l^eedom of the Straits for which it was&apos;of the highest importance that; Chanak should be effectivelyheld.   Chanok was, in the vie?; Of the 3ritish government,of more importance than Constantinople or Ismid.   TheGeneral was to have full discretion as to whether theBritish troops should becon/c*4trca  Chanak or not.   Ifhe decided to hold Chanak for two or three weeks the BritishGovernment would approve and support his decision, and inthis case he should notify        Mustapha Zemal of his intention and warn him against any violation of the neutralzones.Some discussion took place as to the desirabilityof inserting in the telegram some phrase about abstainingfrom any provocative action, but the General feeling wasin favour of inserting this warning in a telegram to besent to Sir Horace Rumbold.In
I315In tli i s eo nn ec t i on, :. Admiral ChatfieId on qu 1 re dwhether-the Conference thought that it would he provocativeaction for the Navy to present the Kemalists. from occupying the Islands in the Sea of Marmora..It was unanimously agreed that such action couldnot he con strued as p rovocat ive. .The view was expressed that General Haringtonshould take particular care that skirmishes should not takeplace between cavalry patrols.,  and that his cavalry should beused to observe the enemy without so far as possible becomingengaged.     On the other hand, it was pointed out-, that smallcavalry engagements of this kind might have the effect of stopping the Kemalist advance on the frontier of the neutral zone and avoid heavy fighting...    Mostapha Kemal had no intention of resisting the British Empire and.his, troops wouldprobably refrain from advancing if they were satisfied thatthe British were going to make a stand.It to.s agreed(See Conclusion ($) .aad Ik))8.        The Conference had under consideration a telegram fromthe Prime Minister of Australia, dated 20th September (CP..4200)Ho, 17, in which Inter alia Mr. Hughes- complained that full information as to the developments of the situation in the BearEast had not been supplied to the Australian Government.     TheConference was reminded, that the telegram in question had crosseda telegram sent by the Secretary of State for the Colonies tothe Governors-General of Canada, Australia, Hew   Zealand, SouthAfrica....
Africa, Newfoundland and the High Commissioner of Iraq (No,18 0fCP, 4200) in which the situation had he en clearly summarised,Emphasis was laid on the necessity for-affording adequateinformation to the Dominions with the least possible delay.It was agreed -&apos;(See Conclusion I)JThitehall Gardens.

CONCLUSIONS reached by a Conference of ministers held on Wednesday, September 20th, 1922at 9.30 p,ra.The Conference &quot;agreed: -..

(i) hat full information as to vtha developmentof the situation in the hear East must&quot; besent daily to the Dominions;        Shat theSecretary of State for the Colonies shouldorganise the necessary staff arrangementsfor ensuring this and that in&apos; particular,he should prepare a      suitable reply tothe telegram from the Prime Minister ofAustralia, dated 20th September, No. 17,CP. 4200.(j) That the war Office should send to General Haringtonas from the Cabinet, a telegram to the follow-lag.effect :-Informing him that a summary of thepolitical situation as disclosed by LordCar sonTs discussions at Paris was beingtelegraphed separately to Sir Horace Riunbold;that this would Indx cate the importance ofany action which might unnecessarily precipitatehostilities;    that a revised programme of troop movements, showing the earliest possi blcdate at which the reinforcements, which theGovernment were expediting,  could arrive,was being telegraphed;    that both these telegrams should be borne in mind in considering this message.      That the Cabinet thought itdesirable for General Harington1 a guidance,and subject to his better judgement, to actforth the relative importance that was attachedto the various positions committed to hischarge.     That the foundation of British policyin that region was the Gallipoli   Peninsulaand the freedom of the Straits.     It was of thehighest importance that Chanak should be heldeffectively   for this.     Apart from its military importance, Chanak had now become a point ofgreat moral significance to the prestige of theEmpire.     It would be regarded as a valuableachievement if it could be held.     A blow at &apos;Chanak would be a blow at Great Britain alone,whereas, Constantinople and Ismid were of inter-national consequence, affecting the whole of theAllies.     In comparison with Chanak, the Cabinetregarded Constantinople as second and Ismid asthird.     2he Kemalists would probably not attack the Ismid position.     Should they do so and reach the Bosphorus, the Admiralty had&quot; declared thatthey, could still prevent the transport into europe of the Nationalist army.     if they bombardedPera&quot;^ the Navy could retaliate on some convenientTurkish area.     The Ismid Peninsula v/as regarded by the Cabinet as at once the most difficult tohold   and if lost, as the least fatal.At the proper moment it might be well that GeneralEurington should withdraw his troops from Ismidand even from Constantinople to Chanak, thussecuring the latter position on an adequate front and in good tine.      She Cabinet had sufficientconfidence in the Gene-ral&apos;s jiidgment as -to vibetherand when such a concentration at Chanak should bemade.     Should he decide on -the above considerations
and in all the circumstances that there was agood chance of holding Chanak for two or threeweeks, the Cabinet would cordially approve sucha decision,      The decision in regard tomobilisation of the two Divisions at home wasbeing   deferred until the development of the nestphase in the situation.     General Harlngtan was authorised through the High Commissioner tomake to Mustapha JCeroal any notification thatmight, be necessary with the object of securingChanak.     Fotfexample-, he could warn him againstentering the neutral sone in this-region, andthat,  should he do so, he would be fired on if he used the roads along the sea coast to approach the positions held by General Harington^troops.    , The form and scope of such warning was left to the General.     General Harington was totake all the above as a guide rather than as an instruction as   the Cabinet had the utmost con-fiderce in his comprehension of the whole position.     He was instructed to show-a copy ofthe telegram to the Naval Commander--in-Chief.(Paraphrase of telegram actually sent).The Foreign Office were instructed to transmitthe above telegram immediately&apos; to Lord Curs on inParis,That the Admiralty should be authorised to notify the Naval Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean -that measures to prevent tho transport of Turkish&quot;Nationalist forces to tho Harmsra Islands or totha European Shores of tho straits and the sea of Marraars snould not be regarded gs provocative&quot;action.2, ^Whitehall Gardens,gist September.19223.W./1
