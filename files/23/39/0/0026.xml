Conference.     He had pointedout to the Ambassador that the French Note was susdeptibleto two possible interpretations.     First, it might-&quot;merely beregarded as expressing legitimate doubts as-to the meaning
 of the resolution adopted at Cannes on January 6th, and  second, it might be regarded, as an attempt to prevent the Genoa Conference taking place. The French Ambassador had unhesitatingly replied that the first interpretation was the correct one and that the French Government had every intention that the Conference, should take place. Moreover, he had insisted that as the two Governments were so closely concerned in calling the Conference together, it must not be allowed to fail. Consequently, adequate preparations must be made. Lord Curzon had then pointed out that the proposed postponement for three months would be regarded by the world as postponement sine die and he did not think the British Government could possibly entertain the suggestion. He had further pointed out that the actual fixing of the date rested with the Italian Government, which was convening the conference and that up to the present time, notwithstanding the fall of the Government and the failure to form a new Government the Italians had shown no disposition to postpone. He had admitted, however,  that if further delay occurred in the formation of an Italian Government, some slight postponement might become inevitable. On the French Ambassador&apos;s observing again that the French Government had every intention of participating in the Genoa Conference. Lord Curzon had suggested that perhaps the best plan would be for the French Government to send over experts to discuss details with the British Interdepartmental Committee which had been considering, the Agenda. (Lord Curzon&apos;s letter to Lord Hardinge, describing the above conversation, will be circulated).

THE PRIME MINISTER said he thought that Lord Curzon&apos;s plan to invite the French to send technical experts to London for a discussion, was an extraordinarily good one.
LORD CUR&amp;Ofl said that the views he had expressedwere-not merely his own, but those of his Office and the interdepartmental Committee, all of which had reached.theconclusion that the French criticisms of the resolution of January Sth were bona fide.     He repeated that LI. Sainte-Aulaire had insisted that M.Bo inoare&apos; did not wish to wreckthe Oonfereuoe.THIS EtiillB ItUlISBiSx agreed that it was unlikely thathe had any such desire.     He invited lord Curzon*s attentionto an interview with Radekf which had been published in several of the newspapers on the same morning, the gist ofwhich was to suggest a rapprochement between Eussia andFrance in order to avoid Russia failing into the hands ofthe Germans.     This was evidently directed tOwayda theFrench and it would obviously be to France&apos;s interest to respond to this ovtabure.LORD CURSdM undertook to read the acoount of the inter-view..     He thought it was not unreasonable that the french should wish very oarofully to examine the resolution ofJanuary 6th, which had only been drawn up in very general terms.  .  If the circumstances had been reversed and the drafthad been a Frenoh one, we should have subjected it to thesame scrutiny.     He proposed to see the French Ambassadoragain, and Confirm the invitation to the French Governmentto send experts to discuss with the british InterdepartmentalAgenda Committee.     The latter thought that it&apos; could givea satisfactory reply to the majority of the points raised in the French Bete.During the meeting the Prime Minister received a message fro m M.Erassin stating that he was leaving for russia next Monday and asking for an interview.thatTHiS LORD PRIVY SiiAL urged/the.

LORD CUREOH pointed out the difficulty that ivLJLr-a-ssinwas only a trade commissioner and was not accredited as a diplomatic representative.TEifl PRMfcl MLwiSTJ&amp;h said that his intention was tomake it clear to Mdtrassin that it was not much use the. Soviet Government sending representatives to Genoa unless they were prepared to accept the conditions of January 6th*   .* . LORD CURZON then agreed to accompany the PrimeMinister when he saw M,Erassin that afternoon.BOA THii LORD PRIVf SiiAL then raised the question as toINFERENCE.how the Italians should he treated in regard to the proposed conversations between the British interdepartmental committee and the French experts,SIR MAURICE HAJJIEiJiy said that M* Giannini had approachedhim, had stated that immediately the Italian Governmentwas formed he. was to proceed to Rome, and had begged to beinformed as to the general views of the British government towards the Conference;TRU PKIME MINISTER thought it advisable that theItalians should be kept closely informed.LORD question said that in the circumstances he.thoughtit would be as well that the Italians should be asked toparticipate in the conversations- with the French experts.The conclusions of the discussion may be summe^upas follows ;-(a]  The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should invite the French Government to sendexperts to London to discuss the- questions raised in M^Poincare1s Note with theBritish Interdepartmental Committee on theAgenda;
