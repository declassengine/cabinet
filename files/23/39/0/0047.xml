No to,.: This mooting was summoned at short noticeowing to the receipt, hy Sir Mauribe *.Hankey of. a personaltelephone message from tha.Prime Minister, who was inthe country.       Mr. Lloyd George had drawn attentionto the passage in General Harington&apos;s telegramNo. 2451 of 2 5th September,  stating that one of MustaphaSemal&apos;s conditions -foraccepting the invitation to thePeace Conference was likely tc bo that British reinforcements are to stop.       In these circumstances the Prime Minister wished the Committee to examinethe precise state of affairs as regards thetransport of reinforcements, and to So all possible-to hasten their, arrival,: .   &apos; &quot;  : &quot;

The Chief of the Air Staff considered, that of the total of 66 planes due by 11th October 75? could be counted on for regular operations. In view of the area of operation this force should be sufficient to have a considerable effect on any troops on the Asiatic shore within 80 miles radius of Chanak provided that good, aerodromes were available in Gallipoli there were also landing grounds at Galata and? /Helles. If the aerodromes in Galllpoli became congested the question of the use of Impros for this purpose became an urgent one. There was a possible further reinforcement of 2 squadrons from Ireland but as these could not be embarked before October 12th no steps had yet been taken in regard to them.

The Quarter-Master-General said that in the event of ? operations, a base would probably be required at Imbros Mudros (Le?nos) or Tenedos and that the Foreign Office had already been consulted as to the possibility of making use of these Islands if required.

Mr. Churchill referred to telegram Number 2451 from General Harington. It appeared that the meeting between General Harington and Kemal could not commence for another 48 hours; at this meeting no offer to suspend despatch of reinforcements should be made but Kemal was likely to demand that no further British reinforcements should be despatched to the Near East as a condition of his attending the projected Peace Conference. His demand could hardly arrive before 29th or 30th September and by this latter date practically all our available combatant reinforcements would be on the sea. We could accordingly offer that no further fighting units would be forwarded from British ports, except those already at sea, and the names of the ships conveying these reinforcements could be specified if desired. It would be difficult to give guarantees that these/


reinforcements would only be used for certain duties and this point would have to be considered after Kemalis demand had been received. He accordingly suggested that a private telegram should be sent to General Harington saying that any demand for cessation of despatch of reinforcements must come from Kemal and informing him  (General Harington) that the Cabinet favoured the proposal that cessation of despatch of reinforcements after 1st October might be agreed to but that the actual formula was now being considered by a Committee of Ministers.  In the meantime H.M. Ships conveying reinforcements should proceed with all possible despatch.

The Committee agreed :-

(1) That the C.I.G.S. should telegraph to general Harington on the lines suggested above: a paraphrase, of the telegram actually despatched is given in Appendix I.

(2) That Sir M. Hankey in consultation with the First Sea. Lord, Chief cf the Imperial General Staff and Chief of the Air Staff should prepare a draft formula covering the requirements of all three Services, including those of the Dominions, which might, if the Cabinet approved, be despatched to General Harington as the instructions of His Majesty is Government in the event of kemal demanding the cessation of despatch of reinforcements.

(3) That all transports conveying reinforcements to the near East should proceed with all possible despatch: the Board of Trade to take any requisite action. Particular attention was called to the importance of hastening the S.S."Hunnic" transporting 8" howitzers and tractors.

(4) That Sir M. Hankey should communicate with the Foreign Office with regard to the use of Imbres, Mudros and Tenedos by the 3 services if required.

?IEFS for INDIA.

2. The Quartermaster-General said that 5 ships conveying reliefs &amp;c. to India had been detained in the Mediterranean, the details carried being disembarked at Malta and Gibraltar. It was urgent for these details to be forwarded to India to fulfil War Office commitments with the Indian Government and further that certain time expired detachments now
now in India who  could not legally be retained, in theService should be brought back.      As it was impossible forany further troops to be moved from the Mediterranean tothe Near East no demand oould arise in the Mediterraneanfor ships for such a purpose.MR*  PAYNE pointed out that, if ships in the Mediterraneanwere intended to take those details on to India,, thereW3uld be no shipping available at once in the Mediterraneanfor use if required on an emevQen^y occurringsuch as a sudden evacuation from Cons ^aircinople;  it only meant thedelay of a week or so of the troops for India; by which timethe ships taking out reinforcements from England would beavailable,THE QUARTERMASTER-GENERAL replied that the Secretaryof State for War was most anxious for these details to besent on to India and the War Office accepted all responsibilityfor the absence from the Mediterranean of the 5 shipsrequired? - .THE COMMITTEE agreed :-That.the details for India should be sent;forward, from the Mediterranean.SITION-    30 MRo  PAYNE said that if it became necessary to despatchSHIPS. \1 or 2 divisions, Ships would have to. be requisitioned: inthis case much better arrangements could be made if the owners were communicated with in advance0THE C OMMtTTEE AGREED : -such that no/action could be taken for at least48 hours, after which the matter could be re-considered according to the development ofevents and in any case when hostilitiescommenced.TION 4, THE CHIEF OF THE TM PER LA L GENERAL STAFF Informed theCommittee that according to the latest information Hum Kalewas net held but that the troops on the Asiatic shore 6fthe Dardanelles were concentrated/in/
in Ghanak with a flying column to occupy - Hum kaleOr operate otherwise if required..    Personally he didnot fully understand the reason for the flying column:so far as he would judge the point of vital importancewith regard to the Ghanak position was the occupationof two hills to the North and North East of Chanak,...especially so if it should eventually become necessaryto mobilise two Divisions to defend Chanak.MR. CHURCHILL on the information available doubted the advisability- of utilising a. small flying columnand thought an entrenched position at kum kale mightbe more useful:- he considered however that this wasa point which might be left to General.
