THE CRISIS IN THE NEAR EAST.

The Secretary of State for War read the revised draft telegram which he had prepared for despatch to General Harrington, to the following effect:- Part I. That the General&apos;s desire for solution was fully appreciated, and that Sir Horace Rumbold&apos;s advice was being sought. The arguments used by Kemal took no account of the Allied Note of September 23rd. If Kemal accepted the General&apos;s invitation for a meeting, General Harington should inform the Allied and Greek Generals and arrange for their presence in accordance with the Allied Note. It was undesirable for General Harington to meet Kemal unaccompanied. Part II. No information at present had been received regarding the situation at Chanak. The forbearance shown by General Harington was warmly approved of, and he could rely on whole-hearted support if hostilities broke out in the Chanak zone. If necessary, two Divisions would be mobilised in order that reinforcements could be sent as early as possible. If necessary to reinforce Chanak, General Harington could evacuate Constantinople and Ismid. The Government&apos;s policy was to hold Gallipoli whatever happened, and to hold Chanak as long as possible without undue military risk.

The Prime Minister thought that the telegram did not quite cover the ground as regards the breaking out of hostilities. He suggested the addition of the words "if hostilities are forced upon you by attempts of the Kemalists to ? you in".

The Lord Chancellor suggested that General Harington would be well advised if he left the diplomatic discussions to Sir Horace Rumbold. He suggested an addition to the telegram as follows: "In fairness to you, having regard to your military responsibility of the defence of Chanak, you should leave further diplomatic discussions to Rumbold".

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read a revised draft telegram to Sir Horace Rumbold, giving a summary of the views expressed at the two previous meetings.
The Prime Minister concurred in th*--drsrft-sCs^e^-Tt^Legrtmr*&apos;No .441, Appendix II) .The Lord Privy Seal also concurred.   lie consideredthat the mention of the pos sihi lity of war in Europe being-started was very important, having regard to publicopinion.   He suggested that  the wording of the telegram should be made plainer, pointing out that if the war betweenthe Greeks  and Turks was restarted it would mean the trans-ferring of the theatre of tliat war to Europe, with conse-quences that could not be foreseen.The Secretary of State for Forelgh^Affairs said that.   . . -    - %one new point had arisen since the last meeting.   A telegram had been.received from Sir Horace Rumbold suggesting thata further prohibition on the movements of Greek ships shouldbe enforced.       .   -.-The Prime Minister hoped that, it would not be necessaryto send a reply until the next day.   lie pointed out thatMustapha Kemal was in the neutral zone, and general harington must be able to say that until Kemal left this,zone he would be Unable to erevent&quot; the Greeks going toRodosto. &apos; The Greeks were-well &quot;within their, right to remainin the Sea. of Marmora .The Lord Privy Seal said that there were Wo proposals in the telegram.    The first proposal was to turn out of theSea of Marmora the Greek ships that had already beenturned out of Constantinople.    The second proposal was that new Greek ships should be prwv anted from entering the Dar-dardanelles.    He differed from thr- first proposal, but thought we should agreo to  the second proposal at present, thusmaintaining the status  quo .The Chancellor of the. Exchequer pointed out that wecould not maintain the status quo owing to the fact thatthe Gr---eks were already advancing.The Prime Minister said that we had served a notice onKemal of which he had taken no notice. Under these condi-tions we could not say to the Greeks &quot;We will now deprive
you of the benefits &apos;of your sea power11.The Sechretrsry of State for ^crreign Affairs said.. %bart&quot;Trewould be charged with weighting the scales in favour of the greeks by ov^r-ruling the decision of the High commissioners and allowing the Greeks to come in.   He was afraid thiswould prejudice any chance of agreement.-The Lord Chancellor said that he did not understand why this obligation was being put upon us.    Kemal had treatedcf law or of Troatyour offer with  contempt.    On what grounds/could we preventthe Greek Fleet from- coming in?    If there was a possibility .of the Greeks being in a position to continue the fight against the Turks, he did not see how we could take awaytheir chief weapon, i.e., sea power.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs had no belief in,-the Greek fighting force reviving.   He pointed out tf&amp;atthe Generals were united as regards the Maritza line and thatwe were pledged .to let Turkey back into Eastern Thrace.-The Lord Chancellor pointed out that the Turks at presentwere breaking the conditions on which we-had pledged ourselves.By every criterion by which his intentions could be judgedIt was probable that the Turk would not accept the conditions.The Lord Privy Seal pointed out that Kemal might be ourenemy tomorrow.    If so,, we should let the Greeks loose.-   Atpresent we. were trying to persuade Kemal&apos; to accept our terms,and we w-cre not at war yet..    So far we had banned the entry of the Turks into Eastern Thrace, and at the same time wewere allowing the Greeks to enter.    This appeared to be unfair neutrality..The Prime Minister pointed out that this was not quitecorrect.   We had said that we would intervene to persuade the Greeks to withdraw from Thrace provided the Turks wouldrespect the neutral zones,, instead of which the Turks had entered the neutral zone and declined to go out.   He pointedout that&apos;, the- Kemalist; forces had been equipped by our Allies,
whilst at the same time the Greeks had. been--harT^e-dLJTrom.using their sea power to prevent the arrival of this equipment-^-&quot;When the Greeks proposed to attack Constantinople3 we hadforbidden them, stating that both French and British troops would fire on the Greek forces.     This-would have been done*i&apos;and General Harington weuld not have allowed the Greek forcesinside the Chatalja lines.     The Greeks had bowed to our decision^      In the present case we had said that we would use thewhole of our influence to clear the Greeks from Eastern Thrace?tut we had done nothing- against the Turks, who had entered theneutral zone..The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointed outthat, against international law, we had allowed the Greeks tomake their Naval base at Constantinople as a concession tocounterbalance the support given to the Kemalists by theRussian Sovietc      In view of this they could not complain ofharsh treatments      Now it was proposed that the British.Government should over-rule the action that had been taken bythe High Commissioners.The Chancellor of the Exchequer asked,  supposing theGreek men-of-war came up the Straits would they be sunk?The Prime Minister said that General Harington shouldbe told to give notice to the Turks that we had hithertoprevented the Greek  ships from entering the Sea of Marmora,but that we could not continue to do so unless the Kemalistforces withdrew from the neutral zone.The Secretary of State  for War suggested that these instructions should be given through Sir Horace RumboId andnot through General Harington.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggestedthat the wording of the telegram should be;  &quot;Onthe&apos; basis of the terms of the Allied Note we havehitherto prevented&quot; etc *It was agreed that the Secretary of Statefor Poreign Affairs, should despatch the telegram to Sir Horace Rumbold Im^ the above(Telegram Noc 442^ Appendix III). &apos; .The Secretary of State for War read the amended telegram.to General Harington; whichwas agreed to (Tel.

SECRET.

PARAPHRASE. Despatched 22O0 28.9.22.

From :- War Office.

To   :- General Harington.

Following from Cabinet.

Part I. Your 2485 cipher 27/9. Your desire for solution is fully appreciated here and we are seeking Sir H. Rumbold&apos;s advice upon your proposals which will receive careful consideration: they raise political considerations of most serious importance and can be discussed in telegrams between Foreign Office and Rumbold in view of your military pre-occupations. Meanwhile we point out that Kemal&apos;s argument which you think may be legally right takes no account of the specific conditions regarding the Straits and the ?armora in the Allied Paris note of 23rd September.

With reference to your No. 1223 and proposed meeting with Kemal, if he replies accepting the meeting, you should inform the Allied Generals and the representative of the Greek forces and arrange for their presence in accordance with the Allied Paris note. It is undesirable to meet him separately as this would be misunderstood by the Allies.

Part II. We are without information whether a clash has occurred at Chanak.

We warmly approve forbearance you have shown in face repeated provocation and the efforts you have made to avert hostilities.

You can rely upon our whole-hearted support if notwithstanding your efforts, fighting breaks out or has broken out in the Chanak zone or hostilities are forced upon you by attempts of the Kemalists to net you in. As
As Soon as It is clear that our troops are seriouslyengaged we shall-mobilise two - divisions and call, for extra-recruits so that reinforcements may be sent you at theearliest possible moment and-meanwhile, in order ioreinforce Chanak, you may, If necessary,, evacuateConstantinople and Ismid,Our policy is to hold Gallipoli at all costs and .-to hold on to Ghanak so long as this can be. done without undue military risk. -hpTE:       In view of the particularly secret character ofthis telegram, it has been given a strictly&apos;limited circulation&apos;and Members of Council are requested themselves to issue any neces-saryinstructions to their directorates,
APPENDIX II.

Cypher telegram to Sir H. Rumbold (Constantinople).

Foreign Office, 10.15 p.m. 28th September 1922. No. 441.

Cabinet have given prolonged and anxious consideration to proposals made by Harington in his telegram No. 2435. We should have been glad if his views, which he had apparently communicated to you, had been accompanied by an expression of your own opinion, the more so as the proposals made raise political issues of gravest importance, involving some departure from Paris agreement, and therefore necessitating communication with our allies. Harington&apos;s first proposal is for a personal meeting with Mustapha Kemal. War Office has telegraphed to him that an independent meeting is inconsistent with Paris agreement, but that we are entirely in favour of Mudania meeting taking place at once under conditions laid down at Paris and that if personal meeting be proposed it should be converted into Mudania conference.

Haringtcn&apos;s second proposal is to fix line to which Greek army are to be invited to retire at Maritsa River. Should the generals concur in this proposal at Mudania, and should the Greeks accept it, no question of a  military crossing by Kemalists into Europe will arise, though in that case we shall have to provide for provisional administration in evacuated areas, as contemplated in your telegram No. 469. It seems to us useless to assign this task to Constantinople government, because in the first place we doubt their ability to carry it out, and secondly we doubt if Kemal would agree. He will no doubt express his opinions on the/
the matter at Mudania, and final decision should notho made without reference to High Commissioners andto Allied Powers, since matter is evidently politicalrather than military.In the contrary event of the Greeks declining&apos;to accept Mudania decision, and. refusing to with-draw.,   anew situation Is created, and Har.ingtcnrsplan for meeting it.is not strictly in accordancewith Paris decisions.     He proposes  that passage of marmora should be permitted to Kemal because the waters and. coasts Of the Marmora are not includedin the neutral zones which the latter has been told to respect-,  . As to this it must be pointed, out(1) that tho crossing of tho- Marmora at present state is expressly prohibited in the Paris terrasand could only be permitted with, allied consent j(2) that it would involve consequences whichHarington lias not fully foreseen and which mustbe carefully considered before proposal is made.The liberty accorded to Kemal could not in logic-or.fairness bo unilateral.      If ho wore permitted to cross, into Europe to fight the Greeks andanticipate the decision of people.ee conference by establishing his rule in Eastern Thrace greek ships could not be prevented from usihg non-neutral waters of Marmora at same time,- in/
in order to resist his passage: and embargo placed onGreek ships and transports would have to be withdrawn.In this way proposed plan might have consequenceof not only re-opening war between Turkey and Greecebut of transferring theatre of that war to Europe withconsequences that oannot be foreseen.These are the important considerations to vihiohwe invite your attention and upon which we are reluct-ant to decide until we have heard your views.Broadly speaking our policy should be to adhereas closely as possible to Paris terms and only to contemplate departure from them where such departureis made subject of allied consultation and can bejustified in Interest s/bf peace.
Coda and Cypher telegram to Sir H* Rumbold (ConstantinoplcAForeign Office, 23th September 1922,    10*45 p,m^Ho. 442.o  &apos;&quot;H)Your telegram  !o*476.,Please make f oilowing intimation to Angorarepresentative at Constantinople.In accordance with spirit of Paris agreement wehave hitherto prevented and are still preventing entry of Greek transports and men-of-war into Marmora andDardanelles *If, however, Mustapha Kemal does not withdraw from neutral so no,  justification for &quot;this prohibition will nolonger exist, and it will be withdrawn.    (End of R) .(For yo ur inf orinat ion)..On tho other hand wo do not think that neutralityrequires us to compel withdrawal of Greek ships atpresent in Marmora.     Please infcim Harington and admiral of this decision.Repeated to Paris lib.327.     Rome Ho.287.
