1.,        frith reference to Cabinet--23(22) Conclusion3.     the Secretary of State for the Colonies informed the Conference that he ifould be obliged to ask for cabinet decisions in regard to Mesopotamia in the nearfuture.     He then explained the general politicalsituation in Iraq which was as follows -. King Feisal had been making groat difficulties and confusing the situation in Iraq.     He had madeobjections to the Mandate but had stated his willingness to agree to a Treaty.     He was not, however, preparedto recognise the mandatory basis as he thought thatthe mandatory system was a slur on Iraq.     No argumenthad been of any effect with him.     He had recently taken up the Extremists who now regarded him as theirpatrOn.     Various expedients had been tried with aview to smoothing away difficulties and the HighCommissioner had recently suggested that the BritishGovernment should refuse to sign the Treaty at present,should demand the holding of Elections and the consequent summoning of a Constituent&quot; Assemblyy andshould put the Treaty before that Assembly.     If theAssembly refused it the British Government shouldabandon the policy of remaining In Iraq and should withdraw hut still retain control ovesr Basra.     TheHigh Commissioner had expressed the vieU that Feisalwould not disagree with those proposals and that theConstituent Assembly would accept the Treaty on a mandatory basis.     HO had asked for a decision by august 23rd, hut the Secretary of State for theColonies had replied by telegram on August 22ndstating that a Cabinet decision would be taken earlyin September.     He authorised the High commissioner to inform Feisal that meanwhile ho (Feisal) was res-ponsible for preventing violence which would have most
disastrous cc^equehces to Iraq,The Secretary of State then read to theConference various telegrams which describedevents sinde the despatch of his telegram ofAugust 22*k&amp; to the High Commissioner.     (ITos.595, 594, 597, 598, 604, 605, 606 and 607).Prom those telegrams it appeared that inco-operatioh with the ExtremistaPcisal, whilst outwardly deferring to the HighCommissioner&apos;d view that the Iraq cabinet should remain until the Treaty was boncluded,had so behaved that all the Ministers, with one exception, had tendered their resignations.The result was that there was no Cabinet in iraq and Peisal, In a personal letter Yftiich the HighCommissioner had received on August 21st, had stated that owing to tho delay in the conclusionof tho Treaty the internal situatiois^aiad now reached a stage which gave great cause for anxiety.He accordingly asked the High Commissioner&apos; toinform the British Government that In the eventof any outbreak either the High commissioner should assume as British representative full responsibility for maintenance of security, or else he (Peisal) should be made responsiblehimself and be given a free hand.     He asked fora definite reply from the Secretary of State assoon as possible.     To this demand the HighCommissioner had replied that the delay insignature of the Treaty was due to the inability of the British Government to comply withPeisal1s wishes regarding the abrogation ofthe Mandate.    His Majesty&apos;s Government had
been asked bo bake a final decision and make afinal and public offer to Iraq, but as the decision could not be taken before a Cabinet meeting earlyin September it was the duty of Iraq to wait for it patiently.     As regards responsibility for security Feisal could not divest himself of hisshare of it, and it was for his Government and theHigh. Commissioner to consult together and to devise measures to meet the situation.     Thepersons principally responsible for tne unrest wereindividuals who enjoyed his support and sympathy and all that was needed to stop unrest was a clear indication from Feisal himself.     The HighCommissioner had added that in his opinion a gravepersonal responsibility for the present situationdevolved upon Feisal.     In any case the proper course w&amp;.s for the Government of Iraq to confer with him, and in the event of his advice beingneglected  ho proposed   to take such action as might be necessary after consulting with the GeneralOfficer Commanding.     He would be loath to do so,hut warned Feisal that the responsibility for sucha step and its consequences would rest on hisshoulders.     In communicating to the Secretary ofState the tenor   of his reply to Feisal the HighCommissioner added that he had arranged for regu-lar aerial patrols.     On August 23rd the HighCommissioner, whilst attending en official reception,found that Feisal had received tbs) Extremist partyimmediately before, andthat an anti-British speech was being delivered and received with applause In the courtyard of the palace.     The High Commissioner had demanded animmediate apology and the dismissal of the King-sChamberlain.
On August 24th, the High Commissioner had visitedFeisal and endeavoured to persuade him to arrest theleaders of the Extremists.     Having failed to d&amp; so he had himself acted, and had caused the arrest df four- , , extremists.of the most important/   Others were being searched for*The iiixtremist Party had been suppressed temporarilyand its office closed.     Two newspapers had been suppresaecland the Sditors had been or were about to be arrested.The -tiigh Commissioner was about to issue   an announcement that the final offer of Ms Majesty&apos;s Government would bemade early in September,        that the responsibility for maintaining order was a joint one between the Governmentof Iraq and himself^ $wing to the resignation of theCabinet and the illness of the King, the High Commissionerresponsibility forhad taken/action necessary to maintain security.    Ina subsequent telegram the High Commissioner had statedhis personal opinion of *&apos;feisal which was that he was quiteunfitted for his position and was directly responsiblefor Unrest in Iraq? and for bad administration.     Thelast news from the High Commissioner was that Feisalfrom his recent operation was convalescing        1  * &apos; and wou..c:. now have to choose between supporting the High Commissioner ana dissociatinghimself from the latter*s action.     The High Commissionerproposed, if he was obliged to intervie\v him beforereceiving any indication of the views of the BritishGovernment, to state that Feisal had now/l .et opportunityto change his attitude and to demand the clearance ofthe objectionable portion of his entourage and renewedassurances that Feisal would abstain from interferoncewith/-
appointmentswith regard to and details of internal administration.Some discussion took place on the situation disclosed by the telegrams from the High commissioner and the opinion was expressed that if it became necessary eventually to withdraw from Iraq, Peisalshould not be allowed to remain there in any case.The Conference agreed(l)    That the Secretary of state forthe Colonies should generally supportthe policy adopted by the HighCommissioner, and should approve the action which the High Commissionerproposed to take.(2)    To take note of the intention of theSecretary of State for the colonies to bring   the whole question ofBritish policy towards Iraq beforethe Cabinet at an early date,probably about the middle of September.
2.        The Secretary of State for the Colonies readjpEDISTAN.     to the Conference a telegram from tha High commissioner of Iraq, dated August 27th (see Appendix) regardingan incursion into Rania by a Turkish band of 200men under Eua Demlr.     The High Commissioner hadenquired whether it would not be possible toremonstrate with tha Angora Government regardingthe hostile activities of eliz DemirThe Conference took note of thecomrauiiicatione made to it by the see rotary of State for the Collates,but came to no decision in regard tothe suggestion made by the HighCommissioner of lz*aq.IIISHPCES AT0HA2ALJA3.        With reference to Cabinet 43/82 (4JofAugust 3rd, 19E2, the Conferenoe was informed thatif it was proposed to. retain the British forces atthe Ghatalja lines it would now be necessary toprovide hutting accommodation for the winter at an estimated cost of  120,000*     The Greek forces in thrace amounted to 25,000 rifles, and an abandonment of tho Chatalja lines by the British forces would be resented by the French who would be left to face the Greeks alone.It was pointed out that the recent reportsof large Greek reinforcements having proceeded toThrace had now bead found to have been muchexaggerated, as the reinforcements amounted onlyto two or three battalions;    that a force of25,000 rifles was not unduly large consideringthe disturbed state of the country, and that anattack on the Chat&amp;lja lines by the Greeks was extremely improbable.     large expenditure onhutting....
hutting for &quot;British troops ai tho--Chatalja JLinescould not therefore be justified.The Conference agreedThat, subject to the concurrence of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, it was no longerneoeasary to retain British troops at the Chatalja lineB, and that thaprovision of winter quarters forsuch troops was thereforeunnecessary.modifications.       4.        With reference to Cabinet 46(22) Conclusion 1 ofthe ConferenceAugust 14th, 1922,/was informed that Sir john bradbury had reported that the position in regardto the negotiations between tha Reparation Commissionand the German Government was very serious.   An offerhad been made by the Germans (Hsrr Stinnes being a party) to guarantee the delivery of reparations in kind by commercial contracts with industry, but theFrench representative on the Reparation commission was not disposed to accept this offer.     TheCommission had met yesterday and it was probablethat in view of the French casting vote, a majority in favour of a moratorium would not be obtained.Tho Commission had agreed to hear tho GermanGovernment on Wednesday, August 30th and would post-pone their final decision until Thursday August 31st.An, alternative suggestion had been made that if a moratorium were not granted the Belgian government might accept French Treasury bill  as collateralsecurity for their Reparations priority.Sir John Bradbury&apos;s view was that the onlychance of keeping Germany going was an unconditionalmoratorium with control of her finance by foreignadvisers appointed by the Reparation Commission,
from impartial sources, and he stated that there was a good deal of opinion in Germany in favour of such control.

Some discussion took place on tho situation disclosed by Sir John Bradbury&apos;s Report, and it was pointed out that unless that Reparation Commission declared Germany to be wilfully in default the French Government would be unable to take action against Germany without infringing the Treaty.

It was also pointed out that the proposal to hand over to the Belgian Government French Treasury Bills would probably be deeply resented in France that such action might be regarded as an affront; whereas Belgian Bills were a good asset to the United Kingdom. It was not possible to say what the decision of the Reparation Commission on August 31st would be; private negotiations between the delegates were continuing, but it was stated that M.Poincare was still intractable.

Sir John Bradbury hoped that if the situation was serious he would be able to secure an adjournment of the meeting of the Reparation Commission to be held on August 31st, and that he would be prepared to come to London to explain matters.

The Conference agreed -

That no action on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government was possible at the moment, and that Sir John Bradbury&apos;s offer to come to London if the situation was serious should be accepted.

APPENDIX.

The High Commissioner of Iraq to the secretary of State for the Colonies, dated 27th August.(Received Colonial Office, 2.0 a.m. 28th August, 1922).

No.606 of 27th August.

See my despatch Secret C. dated August 18th sent last Air Mail Situation in Rania area described in appreciation forwarded therewith is now developing somewhat seriously. Telegram from Rania dated August 25th stated that the whole of Naodasht area is now controlled by Euzdemir and his band, which has been halted twelve miles from Rania since August 16th and is now reported to have been reinforced. Trans frontier tribes are very threatening and it appears probable that deliberate attack will be made on Rania. All possible steps are being taken by General Officer Commanding to meet situation with slender resources at his command.

I notice that newspapers forwarded by last mail report that Fathi Bey now representing Angora Government speaks in conciliatory terms of Turks attitude towards Iraq. Would it not be possible to remonstrate with Angora Government through him regarding Euz Demir&apos;s hostile activities and to get orders sent for withdrawal of his party.
