THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said that Mr Chamberlain had agreed that the matter which he was about to put to the meeting was of sufficient importance to justify summoning the Ministers who normally attended the Conference dealing with the crisis in the Near East.

At 4 p.m. he had seen Nihad Rechad who was the Kemailst representative in Lohdon.

(Lord Birkenhead entered at this point.)

He had previously met Nihad Rechad in the Spring, when the latter had come to London with Yussuf Kemal Bey.   Nihad was a gentlemanly, friendly, outspoken man, friendly to this country, the more so as he aspired to be the future Turkish ambassador in London. Two days ago Nihad had asked if Lord Curzon would see him, and he had replied that he certainly would. Nihad began by remarks in praise of what had been decided in Paris, which he thought was a work in the interest of peace, and he had congratulated Lord Curzonon on the useful part he had played in reaching that agreement. Lord Curzon had then thanked Nihad, but took the occasion to tell him frankly that at the moment it hardly looked like peace and that we appeared to be on the brink of hostilities, Nihad replied by asking what on earth Lord Curzon meant? He replied that more than a week had elapsed since the invitation was spent to Muetapha Kemal to a Conference at Venice and Mudania. During this period no reply had been received, and the only communication had been to General Harington, and of a polemical character. If it was said that Mustapha Kemal was waiting for the arrival of M. Franklin-Bouillon, he would point out that the latter had reached Smyrna on Wednesday and that there had been plenty of time for an answer. In the meanwhile, what waa happening on the Chanak front? The Turkish forces had continued to advance to a point where they were in close contant with British troops. They had actually reached the barbed wire of our position and were making grimaces across it! This was in the nature of an
enveloping movement and would soon involve extreme militarydanger to our troop3,(Sir, I,. Worthington-^vans entered, at this point.)&apos;.lord Curzon had then described quit- frankly what had happenedat the Cabinet that morning.   The Government had been toldby the military&quot; y authorities that the position was inconsistent,with th^ security of our forces,    it had been tolerated upto &apos;&quot;he present in the interests of peace, but no-one could&apos;tolerate it any longer;        had then told Nihad the steps that were to be taken 6n the advice o^ the military author-ities.    On the following day the General would demand thewithdrawal of the Turkish forces, and if this was not complied with they would be fired on.   Nihad Rechad had replied,&quot;Butthat means v;arn.   Lord Curzon had pointed out that at anyrate it probably involved hostilities.   NihadjKad then saidthat he had not known that matters were so serious, and he asked permission to communicate this conversation to his chief.   Lord Curzon had replied t&amp;at he hop3d he would notonly tell him this but that he would say a good deal more to Mustapha Kemal,   He should point out that there had b-^en.no reply to the Paris invitation.   v?hy, asked Lord Curzon,was. Mustapha TCemal not at Mudania?   Where was he at thepresent -moment?   Nihad Rechad had than said that MustaphaFeral was at that moment in the train with T-T. Franklin-Bouillon on the way to Angora to consult the National Assembly^Lord Curzon replied that it was not his business to criticise the propriety of Muetapha Kemal&apos;s consulting his national assembly, but he recalled that the Nationalist Cabinet had- whymet at Smyrna and he had asked    /    Mustaoha Kemal should nothave gone //  to Mudania on hi s way to Angora?   His whole attitude was consistent with a dilatory and evasive procedure.    NihadRechad had then said that he was in contact with mustapha kemal, and that the latter was suffering under two greatapprehensions.   First, he believed that the British Governmentwas in communication with and in a conspiracy with Athens,-2-
and was organising Greek military aggression so as to render nugatory all the promises made at Paris in regard to Thrace Lord Curzon had met this by stating that we were not in communication with the new Government, for the reason, if for none other, that no new Government, so far as he knew, existed, and he had asked what authority Nihad had for making such a statement. Nihad had also said that the British were organising the Greeks in the Straits and in Thrace. Lord Gurzon had replied by pointing, out that we had actually stopped transports going into the Sea of Marmora and had insisted on the Greek warships leaving Constantinople. He had pointed out, however, that if events developed as they were doing at the present moment, this attitude of restraint on the Greeks would certainly not he continued, and the very situation which Mustapha Kemal appeared to apprehend to exist now would be produced. Nihad had replied that he was very glad to know this. His second apprehension had been that the Turkish Nationalists were going to he cheated out of the Paris decisions as regards Eastern Thrace, which would be rendered nugatory. He thought that some sort of Government would be set up there which would prevent the Turks coming into their own. Lord Curzon had replied that it was a curious thing that he should mention this today, because the question had only just been discussed at the Cabinet as to the fons of interim administration which should be set up during the Conference in Eastern Thrace, and he had telegraphed to Constantinople that this administration would have to be largely of a Turkish character. If Mustapha Kemal wanted to settle these questions, why did he not go to Mudania, where everything could be discussed Nihad Rechad had asked pemission to tell this to Mustapha Kemal, and he himself had agreed. Nihad had then said he could get in touch with Mustapha Kemal by the following morning, and asked Lord Curzon what he should say. Lord Curzon had replied that it was not for him to say what account Nihad should give of his  conversation, but as
regards the position of Chanak he hoped he would adviseKustapha Kemal that it was essential he should order thelocal Commander to withdrawl his forces at once, before-firingsstarted.   If, on the other hand, he was too late and firinghad commenced, he should admit that it was an error and giveand undertaking that this v/as an isolated incident which he regretted and that his troops would he withdrawn from theneutral zone,    Uihad had replied that he would do this.LORD CURZ01T then said he wished to tell his colleagues the conclusion he had since drawn*   On the supposition thatthere was anything in what Hxhad had said and that he didspeak the views of his Chief, he had said to himself, - was there not a possibility of escaping from the grave emergencythat would arise on the morrow?   Even though the case ofthe Government was irrefutable       and they had an admirablecase to make to parliament       nevertheless they had to remember that a renewal of the war with Turkey would, be a most d.eplora-*ble occurrence and very unpopular.   He asked, therefore, if itwould be possible to suspend the orders to General Harin,^ton fora short period, by one of two methods:    either by holding theorders in suspense for 24 hours, or, if that was impossible,whether it would be practicable to tell the Commander to   extend the time limit given to the Turks by 24 hours?   He felt that the answer to the question mainly rested with the military authorities.Would the delay of 24 hours involve military danger?   Would theTurks thereby be enabled to dig themselves in and envelope ourforce and bring up guns, and so forth, and was the danger of thisso great as to make it worth while to neglect this chance ofobtaining peace?    So many military considerations were involvedthat he hesitated to express an opinion, but, subject to this, he felt strorfgly that if military considerations permitted the attempt ought to be made, and, if it was made, that it wouldimmensely strengthen the Government&apos;s public position.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL added that just before Lord Curzonhad. come to see him on this subject at 7.30, his attention- 4 -
had been called to the headlines in the evening newspapers to the effect that Kemal accepted the Mudania Conference. "Better News", and so forth. All this was an ill preparation for the public reception of the decisions taken by the Cabinet that day. Then Lord Cursor, ? come to him and told him what he had just told the Conference. He had felt that it was too groat a responsibility for any two members of the Cabinet to take, to decide the question raised by Lord Curzon. He had asked Sir Maurice Hankey to obtain the Prime Minister&apos;s view upon the subject, and Sir Maurice would no doubt communicate it later. He himself had told Lord Curzon that he appreciated the reasons in support of the suggested delay in taking action, but that after hearing the report of the Naval. Military and Air Staffs that day he had felt very doubtful whether military considerations would  not render it impracticable. It might be that the additional time given would enable the enemy to dig himself in and bring up heavy guns and reinforoements. He had also asked Lord Curzon whether he believed Nihad Re?had   to be honest, and Lord Curzon had replied that he thought he was. He did not ask if Nihad Re?had carried weight with Mustapha Kemal, but he would ask him that question. He felt the extreme difficulties that any postponement would create for General Harington. It would  give the impression of hesitating and of the Government saying at one moment that he was to act, and at the next that he was to delay. Moreover,ho recalled that September 30th had several times been mentioned as a critical ate. What he did not say, though he felt sure it was principally what was in the Prime Minister&apos;s mind, was that any delay would destroy the confidence of our representatives at Constantinople, who on receiving the fresh instruction, would be much harrassed by the succeding orders and counter orders.

THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said that he had no doubt at all that Nihad Re?had was in Mustapha Kemal&apos;s confidence, as he had accompanied his representative to London last March and had obviously been in his confidence also.
YThaff ha had as Iced Nihad Tbs^hswT dbrh^w^-djrn^o^Mustapha Kemal he had replied that he was.   He could nottell, however, whether he exerted any great iniTrojeno^ with mustapha Kemal.   &quot;Nihad Rechad had said that he could &apos;&amp;awm*-.....-communicate by wireless, and hoped to be able to reach him at8 o5 clock the rte-rt morning.   He wished to point out thathe had not suggested a telegram of a discouraging character;all he had contemplated was that General Harington shouldbe told to allow an additional 24 hours to elapse before taking action.   Moreover, everything he had said was subjectto a military opinion, and if the military insisted that anadditional 24 hours would jeopardise the position it would greatly influence him.THE LORD CHANCELLOR agreed that the considerationsLord Curzon had mentioned required careful examination, but even larger considerations wore raised.   What new fact had arisen, he askdd, since the decision taken that afternoonwhich would justify a modification, of the policy then decided?    6ne of the conclusions reached that morning hadbeen that there should be a very short time limit locallyat Chanak.   The only question tonight was whether they oughtto modify that time limit.   He had heard nothing which ledhim to think it ought to be modified in the slightest degree.1-f the case had b^en made that Nihad Rechad had swifteraccess to Mustapha Ke^al than General Harington had, or that Mustapha Komal had not been in a position to reply totho communications addressed to him,. th-re might be somecase for delay.   As a matter of fact, however, mustapha kemal had had the Allied invitation for the last six days;it was known that he had received the invitation, and 3v* had given no answer whatsoever.   There was no reason why heshould not have replied that he was satisfied on this or that point but must make qualifications on another, and so forth.But he had done nothing at all.   He had received severalwarnings about the violation of the neutral zone, but he had done nothing &quot;but to equivocate, procrastinate and defy us.
TRTTT^RTrTRTv^^ to say that he haxL.beon...somewhat surprised that aftern^onr-^teerr-L^ saidthat Mustapha K^p-al had received no ultimathm.    Tha Cfficer. Commanding at chanak had intended to s-nd him an ultimatum,hut General Harington had stopped it, ard he hi/self had examined th^ telegrams and to his Surprise they confirmedLord Beatty*s statement.    On-&quot;-- of the telegrams from GeneralHaf inset on said that Mustapha Kemal would be given 48 hours&apos;the notice   had innotice, but there was no evidence that /fact been, givenHe thought, therefore, that Lord Beauty&apos; a statement was correct.THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that if that was the case hewas shockw-d      to hear- it.   This might slightly weaken the presentation of the case, but it. did not alter our funda-mental position, which rested on the non*-violation of tho.neutral zone.   What was the position today?   Mustapha Kemalknew perfectly well the conditions of the Paris offer so faras the neutral zones were concerned.   What had he done?    Hehad advanced his troops through the neutral zone right up toour lines, completely ignoring the Paris condition that  &quot;Inreturn for thife intervention th^ Government of Angora will undertake not to send troops either be-for a or during theConference into th^ zones which had provisionally beenneutral&quot;, etc.   After we had committed ourselves to the paris Note our troops were now being netted in and blanketed-so that when the time came that they ought to be able to make themselves felt thay would not be in a position to do so.    In$4-hours ne&quot; troops would be arriving.    He was by no meanssure, that if w* delayed PA hours the spirit of thetroops might not be affected by the insolence of the Turka....-Tre would not whittle down the decision --hicb had been taken,and he had no doubt that Parliament and the public would support the - Government if th*y precceded &quot;with their plan.He was deeply desirous of averting wan, and would gas to greatlengths for this purpose, but he did not think that war wouldbe avoided by weakness of this kind,-7-
THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said he had arrived at the opinion. He was impressed by the fact that Mustapha Kemal had received the Paris message are had given no reply to it. The impression he got from the account of Lord Curzon&apos;s interview with Nihad Rechad was that Nihad had been sent to "blind" London. All the information we had received was in accord with the secret information received that Fared. Pasha in Paris had advised Mustapha Kemal not to mind our threats and to bring his troops close alongside ours, in the certainty that he would not be fired at. All indications of Mustapha Kemal&apos;s real attitude were to this effect. As regards Mustapha Kemal&apos;s suggestion, for example, that the British Government was in collusion with the new Greek Government, he pointed out that there had been no revolution in Greece until two days ago, yet for six days no reply had been received.  The Paris Note provided for the non-violation of the neutral zone, yet all the time Mustapha Kemal was pushing up men into it.  He regarded Nihad Rechad&apos;s statement as probably being for the purpose of blinding us, when Kemal&apos;s real object was to get into Thrace. He was inclined to distrust Nihad&apos;s suggestions altogether.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said he was convinced that Nihad had not come with any instructions of this kind.

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said he might be an unconscious agent. For his part, he thought that if the Government indulged in any further delay Mustapha Kemal would get enough men into the neutral ? to blanket us so that our force would be masked from effective action if and when the tire came. He would be very sorry to postpone action.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS asked that the military view might now be heard.

THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that, as he conceived it, the soldiers could only tell them as to the effect of the 24 hours&apos; delay.
THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY added. "And how far the position and ?oral of the forces at ?harnal would be affected by delay".

THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF said that, as he read the situation, the ultimatum left the War Office at about 4 p.m. On an average of the time taken by these telegrams it should be reaching General Harington at that very moment (about 11 p.m.) The telegram was a definite, straight forward order. General Harington would at once issue orders to General Marden on the spot. He did not know how long communication with General Marden would take, but it would take General Marden three or four hours to communicate the orders to the troops and to the Turkish local Commander. That would bring the situation up to 4 or 5 a.m. In reply to  Lord Curzon, he said there was no day or night in carrying out military orders, and undoubtedly the communication would be made to the Turkish Commander the same night. General Marden could be relied upon to take the quickest possible steps, as the whole ton? of the telegram was in that order of ideas. However, it right be 5 or 6 o&apos;clock in the morning before he was ready. A counter order issued now could not, in his view, arrive in time to affect the situation. To issue a counter order after definite operation orders had been issued was fatal and most dangerous, As to the situation opposite the wire, he had not been able to determine whether the 

Turks were close up to the four miles perimeter of the main position or to the wire of the outpost line, the existence of which had only been learn ?d that morning. It might be that they were grimacing through the wire of this latter line. Every moment&apos;s delay meant a larger reinforcement to the energy, and after tomorrow, when a Battalion of Marines was due to arrive, no further reinforcements would arrived before October 3rd: that is to say, the British forces were at the maximum immediate strength on the Morrow.

 
This was not the ease with the Turks, arh. there might he5,000 or 6,000 Turks there hy this time-.    The immediaterisk, therefore, vras that the Turks, whether they were4,500 or 6,000, would ha engaged with 5,500 British juifantryIt was true that General lUarden might he able  to withdrew,the outposts tonight;    probably he would endeavour to do so.If there were a further 24 hours&apos; de-lay there was a grave danger that the rush, of the Turks after the capture of theoutpost line might enable the Turks to overwhelm us by forceof numbers.   In such a situation our own troops and the enemy would be inextricably mixed up, and artillery and machine-gunfire could do very little.   The only possible militaryargument he could think of in favour of delay was the factthat the air fighting squadron, on which a good deal ofreliance was placed, could not arrive until tonight ortomorrow.   If these aircraft were in action he would feelhappier as tp the situation.    H1b* opinion, however, was&apos; thatjto issue a counter Order now would be disastrous .THE SECRETARY OF STATE POR POREIGN AFFAIRS said he hadnot suggested a counter order, but merely a delay in givingexecution to the order.TB71 LORD PRIVY SEAL thought that Lord Cavan&apos;s opinion was decisive.   As Lord Curzon had said, both military andpolitical considerations were involved, and he himself had felt, with Lord Ourzon, that it would he right to do every-thing possible to preserve peace, provided that we did notendanger our &quot;troops, but Lord Cavan&apos;s statement seemed toleave no doubt of this.THE FIRST LORD OP &quot;HE ADMIRALTY said he had reserved hisopinion deliberately until he had heard Lord Cavan, because he thought that military opinion would he decisive on thispoint.    The Government might not be forgiven if it did not make every effort to preserve peace, but they would be still less forgiven if they put our troops in jeopardy,   He had
rather expected to hear tonight that there was a new com-municaticn from Ilustapha Kemal.. It transpired,ho&quot;&apos;ever,that the position was precisely what it had he en when thedecision was taken that afternoone    J:n the circumst? noes ,he felt sure the duty of the Government was to. adhere totheir decision.THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that though he had urged the opposite view to Lord Curzon, he was very glad that theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs -had given an opportunity-nity for this discussion.THE SECRETARY OE STATE EOR THE COLONIES said he sympathisedmost deeply ,with the Foreign Secretary, who was bound to assure himself,  like Sir Edward Grey in 1914,  that no stonehad been left unturned to preserve peace,  and he felt he hadthe full right to clear his conscience in the matter.    after all, it was his duty more than anyone els^ * s.    He agreed,however, in the opinions expressed that it was not physicallypossible to defer action without the gravest risk.    It mightupset the whole situation.    It would almost certainly makeGeneral Harington feel that he did noc know where he was.He would probably say to himself that the Government had&quot;cold feet&quot;.   Moreover, a counter order issued, at the last moment might prove only partially effective.    consequently the Cabinet could, not undo what had been done after very careful consideration.    He himself, however,  did not take atragic view of the situation, and had by no means lost hopethat there might still be a peaceful settlement.   He did notthink the action to be taken on the morrow would excludeconversations being reopened in a few days&apos; time.    The Turksmight scurry off with some loss.   He thought it quite possible, however, that this might not result in war.    It mustbe borne in mind that Mustapha Kemal was at war with the greeks, and his aim was to pursue them into Thrace.    So faras he was concerned, the British force at Chanak was an
jjrxrelevattce .   He oouldhardly iDOlieve that Mustapha Kemalwished to embroil himself with us.  That Mustrapha Kemalthought and what had been dinned into him was that theBritish could he trampled on and ignored.   He might -get government&amp;that  idea if a lesson were given him locally at Chanak.   Harecalled what had happened in similar circumstances some two and a half years ago, when there had been an operation ofthis kind.    The decision had then had to be taken without consulting the Cabinet.   The Nationalists had lost about 100and we about 15 men, and the incident had closed.    He thought,therefore, there was a danger of exaggerating the situation-After all, the Nationalists only had about 80,000 sabre3 -and bayonets in all, and they did not want to lose themfighting us.   Moreover, they did not want to waste ammunition.When Musstapha Kemal, found he was up against people who would stand up to him. he vight change his attitude, and Lord Curzoncould then again take up the threads of the peace settlement.$HE LCRD PRIVY SEAL agreed that it was quite possiblethis might he the way to avoid trouble,, hut it was impossibleto lot off guns without having in mind that greater eventsmi&apos;vht come out of it.THE LtfRD CHANCELLOR asked Lord Curzon if he differed froiithe general view?THE SECR^military OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS Said he hopedthat the decision would prove a might one.   He was glad ofthe reception that had been given to his action in takingwhat was, he thoughti  an obvious duty.    He still had hisappr?h-:-nsion^ hut he thought tho question was decided first  -by the physical impossibility of communicating, and, second,by Lord Caw an&apos;s strong belief that 24 hours, while addinglittle to our strength, might add considerably to that ofthe enemy.    The course he had proposed,  therefore, appearedimpracticable, and th*y could only hope for the. best.THE FIRST LORD OF mRT. ADMIRALTY, reverting to what Fa-Churchill had said as to Chanak being an irrelevance from
Kemal^a point of viowj, said lie hoped that tho,-Gro^ke- ^-cold-1also he regardedas an irrel^an^rt^w-our- Txrlnt of View,Ho felt it was--essential that wo should hot again back uptho Greeks.THE LORD IEIVY SEAL informed tho Conference that thePrime Ministor&apos;s view accorded with the conclusion whichhad been reached, namely, that the prospects of securingpeaoo hy tho proposed dolay wore not commensurate with the .military risks involved.NOTE.   While the Conference was assembling,the First Lord of the Admiralty hadroad some information rcoeived bytho Naval Intelligence Department asto the close association by the SovietGovernment with tho Turkish Nation&amp;l-ists, and with strong indications of support.The, Conference adjourned at 11.30 p*m*2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I.September 30, 19 g.
