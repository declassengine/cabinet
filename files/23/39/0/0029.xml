 the British Delegates would have freedom to go ahead to the extent he had indicated.

THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said there were three stages:-

(1) The Cannes Resolutions must be accepted by the Soviet Representatives.

(2) If they accepted, the Allied Representatives would have to judge from their demeanour and general attitude as to whether they were acting bona fide.

(3) If they came to the conclusions that they were acting bona fide, then they could go far as to agree to representation by a chargé d&apos;affaires.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said he understood the proposal, but he was not sure it would work out that way. It was true that after the ratification of the Treaty of Versailles the British Government had appointed a Chargé d&apos;affaires, Lord Kilmarnock, in Berlin, and the Germans had appointed one in London. This arrangement had lasted for five or six months. This was a lower phase of diplomatic recognition. His idea was not to give recognition. His main idea, however, was that on no account should the British Governement act alone in this matter.

THE PRIME MINISTER said he entirely agreed in this latter suggestion.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said it would be fatal if the British Governement acted alone. 

THE PRIME MINISTER said they would not recognise alone but it would not be advisable to say this in public at present.

THE 
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said that in Paris M. Poincaré had told him that him that he was not coming to Genoa at the outset but would send more other Minister. The reasons for not coming had been somewhat lame. He said he could not be absent from Paris when the President was on his tour in Africa. He himself and M. Schanzer had then pleaded with M. Poincare, A little later M. Poincare and again reverted to the question, and had asked what arrangement would be made if a Prime Minister turned up at some later stage in the Conference. Would it be necessary, he asked, to turn out some other Delegate? Lord Curzon had replied that there were no rules in such matters. In effect my Prime Minister of for the matter of that, any Foreign Minister, could always be brought into the Conference. This incident, however, showed that M. Poincaré was a little anxious last a bad impression  should be created in France by his absence from Genoa. As soon as he had satisfied the French chauvinists by not attending at the outset, he would probably repair to Genoa.

 M. Schanzer had said that it would be lucky if the Conference was completed in two months, M. Poincare had said six months, but had been talking in a derisory manner. M. Shanzer&apos;s idea of forming Committee at once did not appeal to him (Lord Curzon). The Russian and German Representatives would certainly wish to speak at the outset. Sir Maurice Hankey had told him that there was some idea of making speeches outlining the scope of the Conference on proposing the Chairman. In any speech he made the French Representative would at once ask if the Cannes conditions were accepted. There would probably then follow a long wrangle which would occupy some time. Dr. Benes and the Russian and German Representatives would certainly wish to      
to speak.   when would follow a discussion of fee&apos; CanoesResolutions.   Probably the Goraraittees would not start,work under a fortnight.   Then and not until then would the question ef recognition arise. &apos; -Then would be, themoment to. secure, if not unanimity, at any rate a general&apos; me asure of egreement on t he subi eo t.THE REIUE &amp;II$ISTSE and TEE LORD   EE IVY SEAD agreed.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL thought it was probable thatthe&apos;Russians would offer some sort of acceptance of the cannes Resolutions.The Conference of Ministers an the   previous, eveninghad been&apos; very firm on-the necessity for standing by thefull terms of the Cannes resolutions.   If these weresecured&apos; then &apos;they would have, to be worked out in detail-.-.*XHE PEIisE Mill3fEE said he agreed generally withthe Secretary of state for foreign affairs.   Supposingthe Russians were to say that they accepted the CannesResolutione in principle and were then to advance counterclaims, he himself would be inclined to suggest the questionfeeing referred to a Committee *   The plans worked out by theAllied Experts might then be handed to the Russians.   This ,  -Committee, he.thought, would have to be a&apos; political Committee,but the details were of vital importance.   It wauld benecessary to ascertain, for instance, exactly what theRussians meant when they accepted the payment of debts.Would they give bonds as- regards the Railways?   -Would theyrestore the factories?   All this would nave to be gone into in detail.   Possibly the Chancellor of the Exchequermight be the mast -suitable- person for such a Committee.THE SECRETARY OR STATE E3H i&quot;OREIG-K&apos; AEFAIRS said he didnot wish to be on such a Committee.1 THE/
THE LORD PRIVY SEAL again adverted to the impossibility of taking any isolated action.

 THE PRIME MINISTER agreed, but said it would be inadvisable to advertise the fact as the French would take advantage of it.

 THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that on the assumption that the Russians accepted the Cannes Resolutions the question would arise of some sort of recognition.

 THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that some status in the Courts of Law would be essential.

 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS pointed out that even a qualified recognition would amount to de jure recognition.

 THE LORD CHANCELLOR agreed that technically this was correct. The writers on international Law, however, always spoke of de jure recognition as the full admission to the comity of nations. A country which had in former circumstances had an Ambassador, would hardly be admitted to the comity of nations if only allowed to have a Charge d&apos;affaires.

 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS pointed out that the Representative would have access to the Foreign Office. The main difference would be that he would not go to Court.

 THE PRIME MINISTER read an extract from a letter which had been communicated to him by the Home Secretary, indicating that M. Lenin was abandoning his communistic principles. If this were the case by recognising him we should be supporting those in Russia who were in favour of moderation. He did not contemplate ceremonial recognition.

 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said that a Charge d&apos;affaires would go to Court, although he would not be received individually by the King.

THE/
THE PRIME MINISTER said that Sir Eyre Crowe on the previous say had spoken to him of an unofficial Charge d&apos;affairs.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS pointed out that at the present moment in Greece, the British Government had a Minister who did not go to Court because we did not recognise the King.

THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that the present arrangement under which M. Krassin, when dealing with matters which were outside the scope of the Board of Trade, referred not to the Foreign Office but to the Prime Minister himself, was very inconvenient.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS at this point received particulars of the precedent of the German Ambassador. The Treaty of Versailles had been ratified on January 10th, 1920. On the same day Lord Kilmarnock had been appointed Charge d&apos;affaires at Berlin. On June 29th he had been replaced by Lord d&apos;Abernon as Ambassador. On January 20th M. Sthamer had been appointed Charge d&apos;affaires, and on October 14th he had been appointed German Ambassador in London.

  
LORD CURZON then postulated the case where the Genoa Conference might last longer than was originally anticipated. He understood that the Prime Minister might be able to stay away for a month as a maximum. It was possible that at the time of the Prime Minister&apos;s return, the position might not be sufficiently clear to take final conclusions. On his return Parliament would probably ask to what extent he proposed to recognise the Bolshevists. In such an event would it not strengthen his hands to be able to state his position clearly to Parliament.

 THE PRIME MINISTER recalled that he had had to return from the Paris Peace Conference once or twice in order to explain the position to Parliament. He would have to judge what the position was in consultation with Lord Curzon and Sir Robert Horne. He hoped that the Lord Chancellor would also be there for consultation. He agreed that it was possible he might have to return as the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs had suggested, but he did not want the Delegation to be tied. The condition which would be asked of Russia were necessary, but somewhat humiliating. They might ask at the outset "If we do all this shall we have some sort of recognition?&apos; It might be necessary to give the Soviet representatives some idea of the extent of the recognition they might get before progress could be made. On the question of the time the Conference was likely to take, he agreed it might last longer than had been estimated. Such subjects as financial, economic, and transport questions might take some time, and during the technical phases of these perhaps the Chancellor of the Exchequer, or if he could not remain the Secretary of State for War, might take charge. He himself and the Foreign Secretary might then return at the later stage.

THE LORD PRIVY SEAL/    
THE LORD PRIVY SEAL asked that the situation at home should not be lost sight of. The Prime Minister, the Lord Chancellor, the Foreign Secretary, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer would all be away. It was indispensable that the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer should be back when the Budget was discussed.

THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that in that event the Secretary of State for War might carry on at Genoa for a week or ten days.

THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that this would depend on how far the Chancellor of the Exchequer felt he could hand over his responsibility at Genoa to the Secretary of State for War.

THE PRIME MINISTER said he thought Sit Philip Lloyd-Greame, (Director of the Department of Overseas Trade) should be at Genoa. He could assist the Secretary of State for War to carry on.

In reply to Lord Curzon he said the Budget would have to be taken by May 1st at latest.

THE LORD PRIVY SEAL pointed out that the Budget resolutions would have to be taken by the House of Commons before May 1st.

(At this point the Cabinet began to assemble, and the Meeting adjourned.)
