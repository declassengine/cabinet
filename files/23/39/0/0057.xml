1. As a matter of urgency the First Lord of the Admiralty said that the Admiralty had just received a telegram from the Naval Commander-in-Chief (despatched at 9.37 a.m. and received at 4.40 p.m) to the effect that he was still stopping Greek men-of-war and transports from entering the Sea of Marmora.

Greek transports and men-of-war into the Marmora andDardanelles.     If, however, Mustapha ICcmal did not withdraw from the neutral zone, the justification for this prohibitionwould no longer esist, and it would be withdrawn.She Minutes of September B8th., 11 a.m., Conference ofI ministers, Page 8, also did not help to clear up the sit-* -uation, and appeared to.require correction by the insertion of the word &quot;not&quot;.     The.
