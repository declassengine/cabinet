The Seoretary of State for War submitted a draft telegram to General Harington whioh had been prepared in accordance with Conclusion (d)(i) of the meeting held that morning.   He then informed the Conference that the telegram from General Harington referred to at the meetingthe previous evening had now been received,  giving the text of a telegram which had been despatched by general harington to Mustapha Kemal (Appendix).It was pointed out that there v/as some discrepancy Inbhe dating of this telegram.   It would appear1 to have been dispatched to Mustapha Kemal on September 27th.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs statedthat ha had prepared a draft telegram for despatch to sir horace Rumbold&apos;.   This telegram had been prepared before he.had seen the draft of. the Wai- Office telegram, but hewas of opinion that the two-would fit in together.    Hewould suggest&apos; a telegram on the following lines, -. that itwas &quot;realised that the situation had changed owing to theGreek revolution, but we must not act in opposition tothe Paris agreement;    General&apos; Harington was being in-s true ted to is su&apos;-1 an - invitation&apos; to a Greek General toattend the meeting:    the question of the evacuation of eastern Thra.ce would have to bo considered In conjunctionwith consideration-of ,the type of administration to be setup, whether this administration should ,be Kemalist orwhether attempts should be made&apos;to control the territorywith Allied gendarmerie.   Ho assumed that if Mustapha Kemaland. the Greeks refused to evacuate E.Thracehad agreed to respect the neutral zone,/then IJsm&amp;wcuM be at liberty to cross the Sea of Marmora.    At the same time the embargo on -the Greek Fleet shoal d b-s withdrawn, and they shouldbe at liberty- to resist the passage of the Turks.The. Prime Minister stated that he considered the telegraias-read by the Secretary of State &quot;for&apos;&apos;Foreign Affairs to bea very fair representation of the views expressed at themeeting held that morning.   There were one or two points -
to which ho would -like - to draw attention .in the draft- tele-gram prepared by the Secretary of State - for War.    First, he considered .the sentence in the second paragraph, referring to possible delay, should&apos; be omitted,,.    It would bo necessaryto wait a sufficient time- to enable a Greek General tocome from Athens,  if necessary.    He agreed that if the greeks refused to attend^ then the meeting could bo heldwithout them.   His second point was &quot;the&apos;question of the type of authority to be Set up in Thrace.    This point hadalready been raised by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs,   His third point was the suggestion of the evacua-tion of the Chanak zone.   He could hot agree to this sent-ence.The Secretary of State for War pointed out that the suggested evacuation of the Chanak zone had been meant tobe part of a bargain, in consideration of which Mustapha.&apos;Kemal might consent to respect the neutral zone.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs stated thathe was not anxious to suggest to Mustapha Kemal that the black Sea was open;    he would prefer-to leave it to themand not thrust it before them..   He would suggest our statingthat we would vary the Paris terms if the Greeks refused to evacuate the area in Fastem Thrace.-The Secretary of State for the Colonies hoped that wewere not again&apos;embarking on the disastrous policy of &quot;keeping the ring&quot;.    This policy was not in accordance with thecommuniques, that had b&quot;en published, and he was sure thatit was not in accord with the views of the British Empireor of the world.   We had stated that our aim. was to keepwar out of Furope&apos;.   This had been reaffirmed by the paris agreement and again by the suggested calling in. of theLeague of Nations.The Seer-:tar;/ of State for Foreign Affairs pointed outthat if a change were made from the Paris agreement it wouldbe-: because (l) it was now doxibtful if the - Greeks.-3-
would agree to withdraw from Thrace.    (S) We were trying to come to terms with Mustapha Kemal,, making concessions to secure the position in Gallipoli and Chanak.    He pointedout that  if Mustapha Kemal crossed into Europe hy forcehe would carry fire and sword into Thrace .   Ho considered ,it was worth while to pay a substantial price to have thematter settled peacefully.    (.3)  It wo\ild be necessary, toset up somn authority in the evacuated area.   What was that authority to he?    It was of no use to approach tho Sultan,and therefore that authority must bo Kemalist.   He suggestedthat   before taking General Harington&apos;s advice,it was very important to obtain Sir Horace Rurobold&apos;s opinion and also to comrjuni-cate with Prance and Italy,    In view of General Harington&apos;position as Allied Commander-in-Chieft he considered thatGeneral Harington should not meet Mustapha Kemal alone,Tho Prime Minister considered that we should stand hythe Paris agreement as far as the new conditions would allow.There would be two meetings, the first being purely a mili-tary meeting at which no political questions should be dis-cussed,   He was averse from any clandestine meetings with mustapha Kemal.   He would be surprised if, in a few weeks,the Greeks were not as formidable a force as that underMustapha Kemal&apos;.   We had never said that we would enforce theevacuation of Thrace &quot;by the Greeks.    He considered it essen-tial that we should stand by the terras of the Paris . agreement.The Lord Privy Seal stated that we had informed mustapha kemal that he could not be allowed to carry the sword into europe.   We were now contemplating the situation of thoGreeks snapping their fingers at us and not evacuating Thrace.If so, we could not carry out the Paris agreement..   It wasnot consistent now to say to Mustapha -Kemal that he must not attack the Greeks whils t tho Greeks were busily engaged in&quot;digging thewselves In&quot; in Thrace.   He agreed that it should
be made plain that we were not new proposd-nTg.bc^g^s^-per--mission to Mustapha Kemal to cross over into Europe as andwhen he pleased, hut only in the event of a Greek refusal.The Prime Minister pointed out that Mustapha Kemal, ata meeting&apos;with General Harington, was.bound to ask where hestood, supposing the Greeks refused to withdraw   fromEastern Thrace,    It was necessary to provide our represent-ativa with the answer to this question, - -The Secretary of State for the Colonies stated thatthe basis must remain the same, i,e,, the neutral.zone must be respected by Mustapha Kemal,     Mr Churchill then read a short statement, giving his views on the situation, point-ing out that his desire was to bring this war to a close and to avoid the state of equipoise and the policy of &quot;keep-ing the ring&quot; .The Secretary of State for Poreign Affairs considered *that General. Harington should not hold a private meeting with ?/ustapha Kemal, If a meeting had to take place theGeneral should endeavour to bring about the meeting arranged for Mudania, and he should invite the Allied and GreekGenerals to attend as well.    ...The Prime Minister enquired whether General Harington, onhis present instructions, was entitled to withdraw the constantinople troops to assist in the defence of. Chanakif he considered it necessary?The Socretary of State for War considered that general harington had already been given sufficient discretion toenable him to do this, in telegram No.91137, s-- -The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that if Prance wouldnot -eight side by side with us at Constantinople it wouldbecome necessary in tirar-&apos; :for us to withdraw.   .The Secretary of Stat^ for the Colonies considered thata telegram should.be sent to Paris, warning the Prench Govem-ment. that we might have- to withdraw our troops from Constan-tinople to assist in the. d &quot;fence of Chanak.   Mr Churchill,stated thatfc he was very anxious that we should not lose our
hold in Constantinople-.   Ho agreed that it might become amilitary necessity to withdraw our troops to Chanak, and hesuggested that the question of-withdrawal from Constantinopleshould he treated as such, and that General Harington should,warn his Allied &quot;Generals there that the necessity might arise.This would avoid sending a telegram to Paris.Tho Lord Privy Seal questioned whether we could count onthe French assisting to keep order in Constantinople.   he considered that they had already served us with notice thatthey would not help.The Secretary of State for the Colonies considered thatGeneral Harington would be more free to review the situation from the military point of view if he wereAot at Constantino-pie.   Whilst there he would be pre-occupied -vith keepingorder in Constantinople.Tha Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that he was con-cerned about the proposed opening of the Sea of Marmora toMustapha Kemal.    Ha reminded the Prime Minister of Ms stahe-ment to the Labour Deputation the previous week, in whichhe had emphasized that the main efforts of the Governmentwere being directed towards keeping war out of Europe.    Itwas important that nothing should be done which would appearto be giving way on this point.    They should make it quiteplain that any alteration of policy would be due to the refusal of the Greeks to accept the Paris agreement.The Prime Minister considered that more should be said in the telegram in order to make it plain to General Haringtonwhat was in the Government&apos;s mind.   The Government had twoobjects:-   (l) to maintain the fro1 dor; of the Straits,  (2) tokeep the war out of Europe.   They were very anxious to attainobject (2).    If the Gr-eks r-fused, it should be made plain that we would undertake no operation of war to force it, butat the same time we would not use our Fleet to prevent theTurks from, crossing.    General Harington should know that if
the Greeks and -Turks disagreed, we would take ho part in fighting it out. ,,- .   -   . .The lord- Privy Seal pointed out that there v/as one otherfactor in the changed -situation.   When the-. Gabinet instructedlord Curzon in Paris, they had bean advised that, it waspossible  for us to keep, the Turks out of Europe by means ofthe Fleet alone..   The Government were now advised that thiswas impossible.The Prime Minister stated that General Harington shouldnot go  and see Mustapha Kemal unaccompanied.    Such a proposed meeting ran counter to the Paris agreement4The Seoretary.of State for War suggested that if general harington met Mustapha Kemal-; he must confine himself to themilitary conditions round Chanak alone,  ...The Secretary, of State for the.. Colonies. stated- that. if general Harington informed the- Allied Generals before ameeting was arranged and they agreed-to accompany him, themeeting suggested in the Allied-Note would thus be obtained.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said he under-stood that he should.send a telegram to Sir Horace Rumboldcontaining a summary of the general considerations beforethe Cabinet,, and inviting his views.The Conference agreed..to re-assemble at 7 pbm. todiscuss the draft telegrams/vhich would be prepared.
CRISIS IN THE NEAR EAST.

The Conference agreed:-

(a) That the War Office should be authorised to make perfectly clear to General Harington, if it is not clear in his existing instructions, that he is at liberty to withdraw the British Forces from Constantinople, if they are required for the defence of Chanak or Gallipoli, and that they should suggest to General Harington that he should warn the General Officers Commanding the French and Italian Forces at Constantinople that this may be necessary in certain eventualities.

(b) That the War Office should send to General Harington a telegram expressing appreciation of his endeavours to avoid fighting at Chanak and of the forbearance displayed, and promising full support if he is compelled to fight as well as reinforcements. In addition the General should be told in the same telegram that the proposals contained in his telegram No.2485 (regarding the passage of Nationalist Forces outside the Neutral Zones) is receiving careful consideration, and that the Cabinet wish before taking a decision to learn Sir Horace Rumbold&apos;s views on the subject; and that it is deemed undesirable that General Harington unaccompanied should meet Mustapha Kemal. - If Mustapha Kemal should accept General Harington&apos;s invitation to meet him, the General should endeavour to utilise the opportunity to bring about the meeting at Mudania, to be attended by Greek as well as Allied and Turkish Generals, as proposed in the invitation sent from Paris on September 24, for the sole purpose of fixing the line behind which the Greek army is to retire.

(c) That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should send the British High Commissioner a telegram, containing a summary of the general considerations arising out of this day&apos;s meetings of the Conference of Ministers, and inviting Sir Horace Rumbold&apos;s views on General Harington&apos;s proposals.
