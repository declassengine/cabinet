MURDER OF FIELD-MARSHAL HENRY WILSON.

(1) The Conference met at short notice to discuss a number of questions arising out of the murder early in the afternoon, of Field-Marshal Sir Henry Wilson.

 At Intervals during the meeting details of the tragedy were received.

MEASURES OF POLICE PROTECTION.

(2) THE HOME SECRETARY informed his colleagues -

(1) That the measures of Police protection for Cabinet Ministers, which had lately been withdrawn on the easing of the Irish situation, had been re-instated;

(2) That it had been decided to close the Galleries of the House of Commons.

THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that protection should also be given to Lord Carson and Captain Charles Craig, M.P.

SEARCH OF SUSPECTS.

(3) GENERAL HORWOOD and COLONEL CHILDS, in reply to questions, stated that there were about thirty dangerous Irishmen under observation by the police in London. These persons were mainly connected with the Irish Self-Determination League, the activities of which were mainly of a propagandist order and were kept separate from the military activities of the Irish Republican Army. It was doubtful, therefore, whether search of these persons and their premises would throw any light on the murder. Search they said would present legal difficulties and they pointed out that the persons whose premises were searched could bring an action against the police for entering their premises without authority. On the other hand, the Conference were reminded that if the police had good reasons for suspicion, it was unlikely that an action 
would be brought and much less that the case would go against the police.During this discussion information from Secret Service sources was communicated byGeneral Horwood and read out to the Conference byMr. Churchill. .   Shis indicated the -probability of the renewal of activity and outrages by the extreme sectionof the I.R.A,The Conference felt that it was vital to follow up Sir Henry WilsonTs murder without a momentTs delay and that no steps should be neglected which might help to clear up the situation.It was therefore agreedThat the police should search thepremises of suspected and dangerouspersons and should effect arrests incase of discovery of weapons Or any-thing else specially suspicious.(General Horwocd and Colonel Childs left tomake the neoessary arrangements for thissearch,) CAUTIONS III (4) The Secret Service information referred toSfflD TO .    - - &quot;&apos; -   -M1SH TROOPS      above contained a warning as to the danger to british soldiers walking about In Dublin.In view of the situation which might be preclpi-tated by the murder of 3PI eld-Marshal Sir Henry Wilson,the Conference agreedThat the Secretary of State for war should be told that the Prime Ministerand the lord Privy Seal considered that every possible precaution should be taken and that it would be prudent to oowfineBritish soldiers in Dublin to barracks thesame evoningo(The Secretary was instructed to transmit this information,.to the Secretary of State for War by telephone, which he did.The SECRETARY OP STATE POR WAR drew thoon the telephoneSecretary1o attention/to the objections which the-8- - .
General Officer Commanding-in-Chief had toconfining troops to &quot;barracks, and asked whether an order   should he issued.THE PRIME MINISTER and the LORD PRIFY SEALadvised that in the circumstances an order should heissued to the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief.In transmitting this latter instruction, theSecretary understood, that troops should he confined to barracks in Belfast as well as in Dublin, andintimated this to the Secretary of State for War,confirming the information in a letter.Half-an-hour later, however, the Secretary ofState joined the Conference, and at once raised thepoint as to whether the Instructions had been intendedto apply to Belfast as well as to Dublin, and the reply was in the negative.)THE. SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR was present for thediscussion recorded in the following Conclusion.OP (5) Shortly after the withdrawal of General HorwoodEDand Colonel Childs, COLONEL CARTER, who had been sent by the police to view the documents taken on the caxoturedmen, and had been asked by telephone to attend theConference on his return, arrived in the Cabinet Room withthe documents and with the revolvers which had been used.General Horwood and Colonel Childs, having given their instructions as to the search of the premises of sus-;.ected persons, returned shortly after the arrival ofColonel Carter.COLONEL CARTER then produced the two following documents :-(1) A printed scheme of organisation of theIrish Republican Army, in which reference
was made to the necessity for an organisation in London;(s) A typewritten letter (Appendix: flwhich was read out.     She intention of this letterappeared to &quot;be to give to persons planningfurther outrages, particulars of the lessonsto &quot;be derived from a previous failure.     Theletter was annotated In a good manuscripthandwriting.The Conference learned &quot;by telephone that the signa-ture of orifk Of the prisoners to his finger-pfihts hadbeen made in an eduoated and good handwriting. *The Conference agreedThat the various documents produced in the aggregate provided prima facieevidence of the probability of a con-spiraoy in London whioh would justifythe arrest of the suspected persons,anary^ffstructed General Horwood and colonel Childs to take immediate steps for the arrest of suspected persons.(Colonel Childs, under instructionsfrcm General Horwood, withdrewto make the necessary arrangementsfor carrying out this instruction).-4^
(minister During the discuss ion of the various documentsreferred to above, attention was called to the situationin the Pour Courts in Dublin, from which are believed toin-C,      .emanate the&apos; principal plots in Southern Ireland, in0Northern Ireland and in the United Kingdom, and whereit is reported considerable armaments, including guns,are stored.The Conference felt it was intolerable that this situation should be allowed to continue, and that theProvisional Government of Ireland ought to be pressed todeal with the matter, ,It was also felt&apos; that the advice of the General Officer commanding-in-Chiaf would be parti-eularly useful in regard to this question.After considerable discussion, the conference agreed -(a) That the Secretary of State for War shouldbe asked to invite the General OfficerCommanding-in-Ohief to. come over to london the s awe day., .   (Sir Edward Grigg retired to communicate this information to the War Office,-t but returned to say thatthe General officer Commanding-in-Ohiefwas believed to b^ at Belleek, and itwas doubtful if he could arrive in london by the following morning.)(b) That the Secretary of State for the colonies should draft a letter to Mr Collins, statingthat information had been received connecting.  the assassins of Field Marshal Sir henry wilson with the I.R.A. and.revealing theexistence of a definite conspiracy;&apos; thatthere was reason to believe that prepara-tions were being made among the irregularelements of the I.P.A. to attack the lives and property of British subjects both inEngland and in Ulster;    that the ambiguousposition of the I.R.A. could no longer be ignored and that it was intolerable thatMr Rory 0* Connor.should he.permitted toremain with his followers in open rebellionin the heart of Dublin in possession of theCourts of Justice, acting as a centre of murder organisation and propaganda.   Theletter should contain a demand that thaIrish Provisional Government, which was nowsiipported by the declared will of the irish people, should bring this state of affairs to an end.
(Mr Churchill withdrew to draft-this letter.    The text of the letter was signed by the Prime Minister at about p,ra., and despatched by specialmessenger to Dublin the same evening.The letter is reproduced in      ; Appendix IE.l^jjG-EMENTS ( V ) The Secretary, of State for War said he had ascer-&apos; &quot;the FUNERAL &apos;   / &quot; &apos;;FIELD- MARSHAL tained that. Lady Wilson would like her&apos;late husband toHPNRY WILSON..&apos; - -    -. be burled in St.- Paul&apos; s Cathedral.   Field Marshal Sir henry wilson .was,, of course, -entitled to a Field Marshal&apos;sfuneral.    If this was agreed to, the Adjutant-general would approach the Dean of St. Paul&apos;s as soon -as possible.-.The Conference agreed   &apos;        &apos; -(a). That, Field Marshal Sir Henry Wilson shotildbe given a. State Funeral at St. Paul&apos;s......       Cathedral?- and- that the Secretary of Statefor War should make the necessary arrange-.... . merits:(b)  That as soon as the Dean of the Cathedralgave his consent, the Secretary of State-for War should.make public this arrangement.SEC I AT IONm SER-iS OF THEHOE.(^ ) The Conference agreed  -That-the Home Secretary should be authorisedto arrange for the Chief Commissioner ofPolice.to put in Police Orders, on behalfof the Prime.Minister and the Cabinet, their appreciation of the great courage and deter-urination shown by the Police in the arrest of the murderers of Field Marshal Sir henry wilson.(During the meeting, incorrect information was received to the effect that one ofthe Policemen who. had been shot had sub-: sequsntly died, and the Chief commissioner of Police was authorised to send to the-widow, on behalf of the Prime Ministerand. the Cabinet,, a suitable expression of condolence and appreciation of herhusbandf s bravery,    Later in the evening,. hovrever, it transpired that the informa-&apos; tion on which this decision was basedwas incorrect.)PR-CARS (o) At the conclusion, of the meetingv the Home SecretaryLISTERS.

Copy of Letter sent out of Prison by W. R.

After his Arrest.

A. Chara 21. L&apos;homme qui porte cette missive est une ?mie personnel de moi. Il m&apos;a oblige quelquefois j&apos;espere que ma mere le recevera bien. S&apos;il vous dit quelque chose d&apos;une mode de faire communication avec moi. Croyez vous a lui. Donnez-lui un Cead Mile Faillte. Donnez-lui un bon "pourboire".

Regarding my accident the misfortune of falling into an unreconnoitred trap was due (1) to circumstances which upset original plans - see No.44 - and - and (2) to lack of time to recover owing to H.Q. not having sent me address of Staff Meeting 11 days previously, and hence giving me notice only on Saturday previous to the stunt. I hope you&apos;ll tell the Boys and particularly those who were with me - I was covered like a rat in a trap. However on the road I put down my hand and drew. I had an old fashioned gun. You had to cook it and then fire. I had only a second. I thought I was cock-pressed - nothing went off. I pressed again and again. Meanwhile two Autos were blazing at me at 5 ........ yards away. I then saw what was wrong. I was 1/2 cocked. I just lifted my thumb to cock, and was struck. My hand was paralised and thumb lifeless. The others had to get out and were scattered. A bullet grazed my neck. A moment more and I was done. A third man was on my right and I bolted zigzagging. I put the gun which was damaged in a bush in the front garden. It&apos;s no loss to the Iads. I couldn&apos;t use it. By hiding in the fields I dodged motorbyke searching on road home and so got off. No.61 had the W. He got out and left it. I am afraid that he was

fuddled and no use for quick thoughtfirst instead of clearing,.&apos;    Then hethought. Young will took coverThen he bolted, but others had&apos;come up and he was done.     He&apos;told-me had&quot;overlooked that tilltoo late.     All of us- were quite cheerful. -  I didn&apos;t&apos; know that&apos;Aff was only 17.     He. is. a good kid.&apos; ,   You will see1, fromthis- that I didn1! first at all.     He has a good heart, but hisnerve was not quite quick enough. -   I hope he. has learntcaution.     T. would have got off but for the Cutters he had.Orders were to clear your house of all stuff and songs etc.when going out.     His slackness, meant his ruin.     He was in good, spirits, laughing all the time.      Point out the lessons of the accident to the lads.      I hope they donH blame me.There was no preparation of defence with us, but I suppose the solicitor was unable.     The jury were prejudiced or theywouIdnH have got H. guilty.      I saw several points thatought to have been put up for him and noted them down for the appeal.     He wouldn&apos;t &apos;t have appealed but&quot; that I made him.He didn*t care 2d.     He sang &quot;Eelly ox Milan&quot; every day,-Tell 44 somebody left a P.C. from me to a friend&quot;of mine namedByrne in a coat In my digs.     He shouldn1t have done,Nothing was found on or about my clothes or room.    A  P.C.lifted  1 or  2 I beleive.      I came here with only- two- as- an escort, on foot to the station.      I heard was going and sentword.      I suppose the Truce prevented a rescue. -   I left the others well and cheerful, but hungry.     However,&apos;&apos; hereyou get plenty of food B*G.      I got v/orse after arrest atfirst.      I have had permission to get J. down at my own expense.&apos;I am in the same health as I was at arrest, but a bitweaker. -   Am now in hospital waiting for.Bad to send J.Bather B. is in hospital.      There is trouble here over dis-t inert ions between us from Gt. 3r. - Barrett, who is an old/man
man,McCann and Harding from Manchester and myself - London -and the lads from home,      The latter have won separatetreatment.     We wanted it and struck.   . I am O.E. now in hospital, hut the others are having a rough time..     Getthe Irish Sovieties to send the solicitor, Mr. McD. to us.Toll him to ask for Mauride Crow, Rlordan, Barrett, McCann,Harding and myself.      Crow is O.C.here.     Riordan wants tosee about a petition about his health.     We all wantprisoners .of war treatment and inraediately,abolition of distinction between us of Gt,Br. and those from Eire-     The sooner he comes the better as McC. andHarding have had a rough time for A. weeks.     Let the Irishin London back us up.     Please tell the lads that if theycriticise my methods etc. I was really quite unfit physically.My debility caused by my nasal disease used to make my headache - and still does - and. I oouldnH carry on.      I gotabsent minded, and my energy was sapped.      I meant to resignin any case.     And the slackness of some fellows made my-Job more difficult.     Most of the lads were good and worthy of the Rorce.       But a few were washouts.      Only the day before my arrest, when I ought to have been free to do mywork, I had to hunt up a,washout who had deserted and dis-miss him.     He was Smith No,9.      I   can tell you howrotten I felt the week I was arrested.     3o I hope-the ladswill believe that had I been O.E. I would have done&apos; much better.     However, I think I can say that I didnH dobadly and that I left an organised and partly trained unitbehind.     My bike I left at 2, White-horse Lane.    E, Croy.  &apos;I sent word before about this, but I repeat it,- I had a punc-ture and put it in a private house - the 75 buses pass the door, now that bike is worth new outer covers.      It&apos;s a goodbike.   &apos; But sell the other - advertise - let it go at 35guineas.     Also hold another steapaca or two now whilst you/ can
can.     But      dosen more Wrs or preferably -Auto.    Ho moyeout of date.    Insist on a proper system..  &apos; You are entitledto meeting.     Now is the time to reorganise.    . If four ofyou go and see the Big Fellow he would arrange an election.And recruits - let 44 and I concentrate on the districtaround.     No.l and so on,     The pice Smith comes from needsattention.     Put .84 and 85 there permanently.     Of coursethese are suggestions only.     I now rank as Pr ivate-.

I2.iBPEHPIX II- &apos;,      .   . Downing Street,-     &quot;&apos; : .  2nd June, 1922Dear Mr. Collins, ........&apos;  I am desired by His Majesty Is Goye.rnm.ent to inform you that documents have been found upon the murderers ofField-Marshal Sir Henry Wilson which clearly connect tho .assassins with the Irish Republican Army:, and which furtherreveal tho existence of a definite conspiracy against thopeace and order of this country-.-.     Other information has reached His -&quot;&apos; a majesty s -Government show in,:: that active prepar-ations are&apos; - On&apos; foot - among the irregular elements of the I, R. A,to resume attacks upon.the- lives - and property-of Britishsubjects both in England and in Ulster..     She ambiguousposition of the Irish Republican Army can no .longer he-ignored by the British Government.      Still less can Mr. RoryO1Connor be permitted to remain with his followers andhis arsenal in open rebellion in the heart of Dublin inpossession of the Courts of Justice, organising and sending out from this centre enterprises of murder not only In thearea of your Government but- also in the six northern counties and in Great Britain.     His Majesty-s Government cannot con-sent to a continuance of this state of things, and they feelentitled to ash   you formally to bring it to an end forth-with.      Assistance has on various occasions been given to dominions of the Empire in cases where their authority waschallenged by rebellion on their soil;    and His MajestyxsGovernment arc prepared to place at your disposal the-necessary pieces of artillery which may be required,-, or/otherwise
otherwise to assist jou as may be arranged.   ButI am to inform you that they regard the continuedtoleration of this rebellious defiance of theprinciples of the Treaty as incompatible with itsfaithful execution.     They feel that now you are supported by the declared  ,       will of the Irish)?oopie in favour of the Jreaty, they have, a rightto expect that the necessary action will be takenby your government without delay.Yours etc.. .
