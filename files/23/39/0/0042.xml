JT&amp;TION IN TEEI Attitude ofloe.fery PolicyIbting the1. The Conference had before them the message from Lord Curzbn (CP.4201) j relative to his firstconversation with M, Poincare on 20th September;and also two telegrams, from General Harington(T.2323 and T2335.).,THE SECRETARY OP STATE P0.R WAR remarked that,it would appear from Lord CurzonTs message that theFrench had decided to concede all the essentialKemalist demands and were not prepared to give any-military assistance.     The secretary^et information indicated the greatest possible anxiety on the part of the FrenchGovernment.    If General Harington was, in the presentcircumstances, to maintain a bold front end hold; his;own at Ismid as well as at Chan ah and maintain controlover- Constantinople, further heavy re-infox-cements .&quot;would be necessary, and this would involve mobilisation.&apos;- - THE SECRETARY- OF STATE FOR-WAR informed the fee of Chanah... Conference that the Imperial General Staff .had been working all the afternoon on the problem of the militarydefence of Chanak and Ismid, and he suggested that Lord---  Cayan. should state the conclusions reached. .THE PRIME MINISTER enquired whether there hadbeen a Joint consultation with the Admiralty.   .Ravingregard to the fact that the problem was not solely a problem of land defence, he thought it most desirablethat before Ministers came to any decision they should&quot; have before them-the considered views of the Naval. . .    -  --&apos; A-&apos; -   &apos; v-  - - - - Military......:
Il297and AirMilitary/Experts,    In this connection it should he rememberedthat the Admiralty were disposed to take a somewhat, moresanguine view of the situation then the War Office.THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR WAR reminded the ConferenceGeneral Hardingtonrs telegramthat according to/T.2322 the Turkish cavalry might be intouch with British cavalry outposts on the neutral zone that day, and that therefore the problem was one of extreme urgency,JHfe SECRETARY OP STABE 2*0R THE COLORIES Urged thatthere could be no greater blow to British prestige than thfhurried evacuation of Chanak: in face of Turkish threats.It was Si his view, most desirable that Chenak should be held,even at the expense of British evacuation of Ismid and constantinople.THE PRIME MINISTER remarked that he would only be in^involvedfavour of evacuating Chanak if the alternative      /veryserious risk of a disaster, but on this question he wouldlike to hear the views of General Earington and Lord Plumer.It should be remembered that Lord Beatty was confident thatthe Navy Could prevent any crossing of the Straits by theTurks in force, and inasmuch as the threat to Chanak was ablow at Great Britain alone, he was in favbur of retaining the Chanak position even if we had to re-ihforce from Ismid.THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR THE COLONIES thought that either the French would endeavour t6 persuade Kemal frominterfering with the neutral zone at Ismid, 0* would withdraw their troops entirely from the Southern shore.     In thelatter case the Kemalists might cone up the BOsphorus andshell the European quarter of Constantinople.     la this case it would be open to the British Navy to retal into bybombarding some convenient Turkish area.    It seemed clear
 from every point of view that the Ismid position was not comparable in importance with the Chanak position.

?re-inforce- ?.

 Some discussion then ensued as to the dates on which the first re-inforcements could reach Gallipoli. It appeared that the guns of the batteries of 6" Howitzers now on their way could not reach the Straits until September 26th. The personnel for these batteries had already arrived.

 AIR MARSHAL TRENCHARD informed the Conference that the "Argus" with the first Air re-inforcements would reach Gallipoli on the 27th and that the Air re-inforcements from Egypt were expected there on the 29th September.

 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR stated that lord Allenby had arranged for the despatch of two Infantry Battalions with certain Artillery from Egypt, but there was a difficulty about the transport inasmuch as the ships would have to go out from England.

 THE SECRETARY 0F STATE FOR THE COLONIES thought that it was vital to get the major: part of these Egyptian re-inforcements to Gallipoli with the least possible delay. This was a matter in which it would be, in the long run, economical to incur additional expenditure if necessary by requisitioning and diverting ships at Alexandria.

 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR pointed out that at present no compulsory powers of requisitioning were available, but he undertook to look into the question in consultation with the Board of Trade.

 It was agreed :-

 (See Conclusions (a) and (b)).

ATTITUDE....


OF     2. THE SECRETARY OS1 STATE FOR THE COLONIES informed the Conference that he had received a telegram fi*om theGovernor-General of Hew Zealand stating that the HewZealand Parliament had passed a resolution by a very large majority supporting the attitude taken up by the BritishGovernment, and that although recruiting had not yetopened for the Hew Zealand Contingent, ov&amp;jb 5000 men hadvolunteered for service.The Conference took note of this highly satisfactoryc ommuni cat ion.3.        The Conference had before them a Memorandum (CP.4199)by the Board of Trade regarding the.-possible issue of a proclamation authorising the Board to requisition Shipping.It was agreed :-(See Conclusion (c)).ILIMY 4. THE SECRETARY OP STATE $OR WAR reminded the ConferenceH OP -ithat it was open to Great Britain to emphasise to the FrenchGovernment the fact that the Allies had solemnly agreed tohold the two neutral zones, and that their action in with-Shoredrawing the French, troops from the South *   &apos;    of the Straitswas in direct violation of this agreement.     He drew attentionHo.433to the wording of the message/sent by the Allied high commissioners at Constantinople to Mustapha Kernel, in whichthe latter was informed not that he must in any event avoid a violation of the neutral zones, but that &quot;It was not desirable*&apos;that the Turkish troops should enter those zones.     He suggestedthatthat the French Government should be informed/it was impossiblefor Great Britain   to hold both Ismid, Constantinople and Chanak.That we regarded the latterras the more important position,end that we proposed to hold it leaving Constantinople underFrench protection.THE PRIME MINISTER
THE PRIME MINISTER was very doubtful as to the wisdom of saying that Great Britain oould not holdConstantinople.     There wore large non-Turhlsh-^LementB,in that City whioh oould help in its defence, and General&apos; . (Tc 3fe3 Part 4) .Harington had already telegraphed/that 20,000 Greeks had offered their assistance, many of tfjbom no doubt would beex-soldiers.     It would be quite legitimate for Great&quot;Britain to srm trustworthy inhabitants of Constantinoplefor the purpose Of protecting their property.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL added that should there be an outbreak in Constantinople with which General Haringtonwas unable to cope, it was clear that he would have toaccept all offers of help of a trustworthy character.5.        With reference to Conclusion (k) of the Conferenceof Ministers held on Tuesday, 19th September, 1922, at11 a,m., the Conference dlsoussed the question of theaction to be taken relative to the roads on the Mediterraneanside of Chanak.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL thought that a warning shouldbe given to the Kemaiists if it was proposed to fire onTurkish troops advancing on Chanak by the roads outsidethe neutral zone on the Gulf of Adramyti., THE CHANCELLOR OP. TEE EXCHEQUER enquired who ther ornot any of. these particular roads were exposed to naval fire at points Inside the neirtral zpne.,   THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES thought thata very grave warning should be addressed to the Eemaliststelling them that Gree/b Britain could not in any cireum-stances allow the violation of the Chanak zone, and thatbodies of troops approaching that zone by the Adramyticoast roads would be stopped by Naval fire.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL pointed out&apos;that if such a warning was given, theAEemal1sts might come up to thefrontier of the zone and remain there with very embarrassing/
 embarrassing oonsequenoes. He thought that the essential thing was to prevent the passage of heavy guns Which could be used in an attack on Chanak. It was vital, however, to discover whether the Adramyti coast roads were exposed to naval action within the neutral zone.

 It was agreed:-

 (see Conclusion (g).)

6. THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY informed the Conference that the Naval Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean had asked for definite permission to sink the "Goeben" and other Turkish warships in the Golden Horn as soon as he received reliable information that the Komalists had violated the neutral zone, or had taken other hostile action against Great Britain.

 THE PRIME MINISTER thought that it would be premature to take this decision at the moment. These particular vessels should be kept under strict naval observation, and all arrangements should be made with a view to their destruction should this hereafter prove neoessary; but suoh extreme measures should only be adopted in the last resort.

 It was agreed:-

 (see Conclusion (e).)

7. The Conference had before them a telegram from Lord Balfour (Geveva No.37) enquiring as to the attitude to be adopted by the British Delegates at the League of Nations towards Dr. Nansen&apos;s proposal that the League should offer to mediate in the present Anglo-Turkish crisis. Referenoe was also made to the fact that in Mr. Hughes&apos;s telegram dated 20th September (C.P.4200 No.17) the suggestion had


 had been made that this particular difficulty was one which Australia considered should be referred to the League of Nations.

 The Conference were generally of opinion that Lord Balfour should raise no objection to Dr. Nansen&apos;s resolution, but that before a reply to Lord Balfour was sent Lord Curzon&apos;s views should be ascertained.

 It was agreed:-

 (see conclusion (d).)                                                                           ?ADICTION TURKISH ELEMENTS ?ECTING ?K OCCUPATION OF ?AK. 

8. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR drew attention to the terms of a telephone message which he had sent that day to Lord Curzon relative to the statement which had been widely published that the Greeks had been at some time or another in occupation of the Chanak neutral zone. The fact was that the Chahak zone had, by agreement with the Allies, been occupied by British troops immediately after the Armistice, and had been continuously in British occupation ever since. The neutrality of the Chanak zone had been maintained consistently against the Greeks, and permission had been refused to the Greeks to follow Turkish bands into the British area, and certain Greek ?trola which had crossed the neutral line on May  22nd, had withdrawn immediately on meeting British troops.

 THE PRIME MINISTER thought that it was most desirable that this information should be issued to the press. It was very important to make it clear to the world that Great Britain was not assisting Greek aspirations in any way.

 It was agreed:-

 (see Conclusion (f).)                                                                           ?ER ?ING. 

9. TEE PRIME MINISTER suggested that it would be most desirable to hold a further meeting of the Conference that same evening at 9.30 p.m., by which time it was hoped that a summary of Lord Curzon&apos;s second interview with M. Poincaré would


would have been roaedved^ and^tTia^ .Chiefs of Staffs would also be available.It was agreed:- ,&apos;(see Conclusion (h).)
