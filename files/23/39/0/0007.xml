The Secretary for Scotland stated that &quot;he^had:been unable until now to raise the Scottish aspect of the housing question, since he had been engaged on other business which he had undertaken at therequest of the cabinet     He agreed that it would beimpossible to have apolicy in Scotland different from,that in England, but there were special aspects &quot;ifthe. Scottish Housing problem which he ^ould have to&quot;deal with.   These were the fact that the problem-&apos;&quot;in Scotland was much rn^re acute than in England andthat a Bill&apos; affecting Housing in Scotland was stillbefore the House of Lords and had not yet become LawCTHe wished to know what line he should take inregard to this Bill-.    &apos;His - position was a difficult one because he would now be obliged to make a state-&apos;ment completely divergent from the policy which hehad advocated. -only three or four weeks ago.   1 At that.time he had been in complete i^ovj&amp;co-of the proposed&apos; change in housing policy, and he-had informed the House of Commons that tho measurewas an urgerA cne*       As regards one special point&quot;    &apos; - &apos;  &apos;  - ; he

APPENDIX.cabinet.&quot;Housing Policy.g 5155.      AMENDED DRAFT STATEMENT OP THE MINISTER OF^HEALTHN(As agreed at Conference of Ministers heldJuly 15th 1921 at 5o30 p.m.)I The number of houses built, building, and contained in approvedlenders under the housing scheme for local authorities and public utility^pieties is now about 176,000*     Under the scheme of subsidy to privateguilders the number of houses built or to be built is estimated at (tout25,000e    The annual cost to the State under the local authorities andpublic utility societies schemes is  out    10.,000,000 per annum and theamount required for payment af subsidies to private builders is about 5,000,000,In view of the immense difficulties confronting the nation during and after the war the Government think that they have no reason to bedissatisfied with the scale ef their contribution to the housing prob-lem - a contribution, notwithstanding the grave embarrassments of the warwithout precedent in our&apos; history.    The Government is under &apos;.ts housingschemes performing at great cost a work of supreme national importance which private enterprise could not cany onto    At the present time theiduses which are being built or are to be built under the Governmentlousing scheme will utilise all available labour for at least twelvenonths including a considerable number of ex-service men to be absorbed)/ II &quot;the industry,    By the end of twelve months conditions may have changed very greatly, prices may be stabilised and the considerationsUpon which Government action should be based may be fundamentallyjittered.   Reconsideration is moreover imperative when regard is paidto the present financial condition of the country.    Very grave finan-lal difficulties will confront the nation for the remainder of theffesent and throughout the next financial year owing to the unparalleled!fid world-wide depression in trade, and the unfortunate Industrialtroubles which have so seriously affected both expenditure and revenue,
&quot;&quot;Th^i^kmn^nme^^being at any rate, the following ljiiillart4.cn.v-nras.t_be placed on by local authorities and public utility societies with government assistance under the present scheme will be limited to 175,000,that being the number built, building, or for which tenders havebeen approved, and assistance will not be given under the schemeappear that on a final examination of the present approved tenderssome adjustments will be possible to meet cases of hardship with-All expenditure in connection with the housing schemes whichhas already been incurred by local authorities with the approvalof the Ministry of Health will rank for financial assistance underthe present scheme, which limits the liability of local authoritiesto the produce of a penny rate, and where work undertaken by localauthorities with the approval of the. Ministry of Health cannot for reasons outside the control of the authorities be completed by july 1922, the time for completion will tee extended   by theMinistry as may be necessary.As regards the scheme of subsidy to private builders, thepowers taken under the recent Act will be e xercised to the e xtentof making payment in full for houses completed within the four months after the expiration of the previous Act, i.e., by April23rd last, and additional houses will be subsidised only if begunbefore the 1st July under a certificate or the promise by a localauthority of a certificate.      There will be cases in whichcommitments have been entered into, although construction has not actually been begun, in anticipation of the continuance of thesubsidy.    In order to meet these cases I shall, in the exerciseof my di scretion, pay subsidy where commtma.it, s have bear, enteredinto if work is started within six-weeks of the present date.housing expendiiture.    The numner of houses to^be-&quot;-oon-tftruc*.edin respect of any houses in excess of thatat number.It wouldout exceeding this total.
The Government recognise the urgent necessity of making whatimprovements flare possible under present financial circumstances in slum areas.     To this end they are prepared to provide anannual contribution not exceeding  200,000 towards the deficiencyon local authorities&apos; accounts for the improvement of slum areas.This annual contribution will contimxe for the whole term ofsuch loans as may have to be raised by local authorities to defraythe necessary expenditure.It is the intention of the Government to keep the housingproblem closely under review.   They fully recognise the importanceof that problem from the point of view of the health and social conditions of the people but it is impossible to incur greatercommitments than our finances will allow.2, Whitehall Gardens.
