1. The Conference was arranged for the consideration of a message received shortly before by Sir Maurice Hankey from the Prime Minister. (Appendix I)

?UM ? ?LLERY.

2. THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF read and handed in a revised statement showing the programme of arrival of medium heavy artillery at Gallipoli. (Appendix II) He added that, beyond this programme, it would be imposssible to man any further heavy batteries without mobilisation.

Every available trained garrison gunner was absorbed in the manning of these guns. Moreover, the General Staff was doubtful whether sites for  larger numbers of heavy guns than these within a distance at which effective support could be given to the Chanak position, could be found on the Gallipoli Peninsula opposite Chanak. The proposed 9.2" howitzers were not considered by artillery experts to be suitable: 8" howitzers were much preferred.

The Conference agreed:-

That, the War Office should consult General Harington by telegram as to whether he would wish to have sent to him the 16.6" guns (the last item in Appendix II) which are being prepared.

?GUNS

3. THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY reported that 6.6" naval guns and mountings were available at Malta, and could be sent to Gallipoli if desired. They were heavy weapons and would require tractors.  There were some other naval guns and mountings available in England. Doubts were expressed as to the suitability of those high velocity, low trajectory weapons and their ammunition.

On the question of ammunition for naval guns generally, the First Lord gave some details of the rather small stocks of shrapnel shell still remaining from the war, which was being sent to the Mediterranean.

It was/
It was agreed:-

That the War Office should telegraph to General Harington to ascertain whether, after consideration of the revised programme of heavy ordnance to he sent him, he would be glad to have the naval guns from Malta.

AIRCRAFT.

4. AIR MARSHAL TRENCHARD handed in the attached programme for the arrival of Air Units. (Appendix III)

After some discussion it was agreed:-

(a) That the Air Ministry should make preliminary arrangements for sending to General Harington&apos;s Command a squadron of Bristol fighter aeroplanes at present located at Belfast, on the understanding that they should be replaced at Belfast, thought not necessarily by machines equal in number or fighting value;

(b) That Air Marshal Trenchard should consider the feasibility of forming a fresh bombing squadron for despatch to General Harington&apos;s Command;

(c) That the Chief-of-the-Imperial-General Staff should consult General Harington by telegram as to whether he could accommodate and would wish to have the two above squadrons.

TANKS.

5. The Conference were informed that no Tanks were being sent out to General Harington&apos;s Command. The French had some small tanks in Constantinople.

THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF stated that the Intelligence Division of the General Staff were making enquiries as to whether the Turks possessed tanks, and generally as to their equipment.

MACHINE GUNS. 

6. THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF stated that the battalions under General Harington&apos;s Command had 8 Vickers and 16 Lewis Machine guns per battalion.

?
He strongly deprecated any idea of strengthening the force in the Constantinople area in machine gunsby drawing machine gun sections from battalions athomoj as this would break up the nrgahisation and reducethe efficiency of any further divisions it might ultimately become necessary to mobilise.
?SIBLE ENFORCEMENT ?IR PERSONNEL.

7. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES drew attention to the fact that there were 1,000 mechanics, etc., of the Royal Air Force, without arms, on board a transport now approaching Port Said, on route for Mesopotamia, who could if necessary be diverted to Constantinople. Owing to the technical character, and the costly training involved, they ought not to be used as infantry, but they might be utilised for maintaining order at Constantinople, thus releasing other troops for the menaced position at Chanak.

THE AIR MARSHAL, though emphasising the need for this personnel in Mesopotamia, and entering a caveat that they were not specially trained for other than their technical duties, agreed with the Ministers and others present:-

That the War Office should telegraph to General Harington explaining the position and asking if he would like to receive this personnel pending the arrival of the military reinforcements en route.

??.

8. During the meeting attention was drawn to the position at Kum Kalo, guns at which had caused severe inconvenience and loss during the Gallipoli campaign, after the evacuation of their position by the French forces early in tho campaign.

The view was expressed that the available forces had probably been considered insufficient to justify its occupation.

MILITARY CONSIDERATIONS ?FECTING THE DATE OF THE PROPOSED CONFERENCE.

9. Attention was drawn to the persistent mention in reports of Mustapha Kemal&apos;s attitude of September 30th as the date when he would advance:-

It was agreed:-

That the Foreign Office, should ask Lord Curzon in Paris to consider the desirability, if practicable, of fixing a date for the Conference prior to September 30th.

NAVAL/
? POSITIONS PREVENTING PASSAGE OF STRAITS MARMORA NATIONALISTS

10. SIR WILLIAM TYRRELL stated that he had received a telephone message from Lord Curzon in Paris expressing  misgivings regarding the Orders which he understood had been sent to the Naval Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean, giving him authority to take such steps as he deemed necessary to prevent the Turkish Nationalist forces from crossing to Europe by the Straits, Marmora, or Black Sea, including stone to control, restrict the movement of, and impound shipping in their waters. Lord Curzon considered that those measures would be highly provocative. Lord Curzon had also expressed misgivings on similar grounds regarding a proclamation which sir Horace Rumbold had reported to him that the naval commander-in-Chief was about to issue restricting the movements of shipping.

THE SECRETARY gave a summary of the circumstances described in the following letter which, after communication with the Prime Minister he had written that afternoon to Admiral of the Fleet, Lord Beatty, copies of which had been sent to all the Ministers present:-

22nd September, 1922.

Dear Lord Beatty, 

After receiving your telephone message at the Colonial Office this morning, I returned to my Own office and  examined carefully my notes of the meeting on Wednesday evening at 9.30 p.m.

I felt satisfied that my notes would justify including the following additional conclusion:-

(l) That the Admiralty should be authorised to notify the Naval Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean that measures to prevent the transport of Turkish Nationalists forces to the Marmora Islands or to the European shores of the starits and the Sea of Marmora should not be regarded as provocative action.

I accordingly/
I accordingly rang up your Private Secretary, Paymaster Captain Spickernell, and told him that I would ask the Prime Minister&apos;s authority for this. I gatherred, however, from Spickernell that you desired a more exact into interpretation than this, and I did not foel justified on my own responsibility, in going further than the draft conclusion above.

I accordingly rang up Mr. J.T.Davies, the Prime Ministers Secretary, who was with the Prime Minister in the country and explained the position to him, asking for authority for tho above additional conclusion and adding that I had gathered from Spickernell that the Commander-in-Chief might want to take precautionary measures even to the extent of dealing with the small craft aid row-boats in the Bosphorus.

After consulting the Prime Minister, Mr. Davies told me that the Prime Minister&apos;s view is that no  Kemalist  forces must be allowed to cross the salt water. The moment a Kermalist gets afloat he must be dealt with. If he believes that there is danger of Kemalist forces crossing the Straits, the Admiral must use his discretion to take any action which he deems essential to prevent this.

(Sgd) M.P.A. HANKEY.


All the Ministers present stated that they had. under-,,stood that the decision of the Conference, of Ministers onthe previous Sa?e*day^evening at 9.30 p.m., had been toavoid fettering Admiral Brock *s discretion, in respect tothe moment when it should Become essential to take pre-cantibnary measures for-safeguarding against the possibilityof the transport to Europe of Mastapha &apos;Eemal1s forces.THE FIRST LORD OP THE ADMIRALTY then handed Sir WilliamTyrrell a copy of the actual instructions sent to Admiral,Brock by tho Pirot--&quot;Booed&quot;&apos;0&quot;  the Admiralty on 22nd September,1922 (at 1405).    He drew special attention to a passage atthe end in which the decision as to when these steps shouldbe taken was left to the.Naval   Commander-in-Chief with theHigh Commissioner5 and Military Commander-in-Chief.SIR WILLIAM TYRRELL- then left the meeting to consult his colleagues in the Poreign Office, but returned a few minutes later and informed Lord Lee that, after reading theinstructions., the Poreign Office were satisfied.: The-Conference agreed :.- -(a) To concur in the view of, the Prime Minister.: as expressed in Sir Maurice Hahkey^s letterto Lord.Beatty, ^and in the.- instructions issued &quot;by the Admiralty after Tuesday^-.meeting as correctly.reflecting the intentionof the Conference of Ministers &quot;at that meeting.(b) That the Foreign Office should immediatelytelephone to Lord Curson in Paris the pertinentpassages of the Admiralty1s instructions.(c) That the Poreign Office should telegraph to theHigh Commissioner at Constantinople that theNaval Commandor-iii**Chief is authorised to take this action when he thinks necessary.TiRY   11. Some brief consideration was given to the militaryoutlook at Chvnak in the unfortunate event of an advance byMustapha Kemal.-6- THE...
THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF was inclined to think that Mustapha Kemal had by delay lost the advantages that at one time had appeared open to him, and was confident that, except in the unlikely event of the Turks being able to bring up heavy guns, there was every prospect of their first attack being beaten off.

With the arrival of the reinforcements in men and guns now on their way he thought that General Harington might expect to hold his Own for 4 or 5 weeks. Long before the expiration of that period the despatch of further reinforcements (involving mobilisation) would have to be decided on. If a second division were mobilised and sent, the General Staff estimated that the last man of the second division could arrive at Gallipoli on the 38th day after the order was given.

Ultimately, however, it was difficult to see how Mustapha Kemal&apos;s pretensions could be disposed of if our troops remained on the defensive. For this it would be necessary  sooner  or later to defeat his army, and perhaps seven to advance to and occupy his capital, for which very large forces would, be required.

The suggestion was made that in the hypothetical circumstances contemplated, it might suffice to defeat the Turks in the vicinity of the Dardanelles, and the advantages of a crushing superiority in aircraft as exemplified by Lord Allenby&apos;s decisive victory in Palestine, were emphasised.

REPORT TO PRIME MINISTER.

12. The Secretary was instructed to report immediately to the Prime Minister on all the above matters.

APPEND DC   I..Telephone Message receivei fromihe Prime minister by Sir Maurice Hankey at 4.30 p,m, on 22nd September1922.I think we have net yet exhausted the possibilities ofmaking up by a mechanical superiority for our weakness in landpower and that this ought to be further examined immediately with aview to strengthening (1) our gun power 6n Gallipoli (6&quot;, 6M,9.2M howitzers) in order to overwhelm any concentration  whichKemal could possibly bring to bear and to put his guns outof action.      We have at our disposal large numbers of gunsand ammunition and if we&apos;had them concentrated on GallipoliKeraal could not make any impression upon our defences at chanak,    (2) More might be done in the way of strengtheningair power by bombing,  and - machine-guns from the air.      i cannot help thinking that by a combination of naval guns,  andhowitzers on Gallipoli, machine-guns bombing and firing&apos;we couldmoke it impossible for the Turks to approach Chanak and asall one hears about them leads one to believe.thrt. they areinferior certainly out of trenches to European troops theymight be effected with panic and disperse.      It would be agreat triumph if we could defeat a heavy Turkish attack alonewithout any assistance from the French and demonstrate tothe world that even from a military point of view we are not as helpless as our enemies of every description imagine usto be..      I would therefore be glad if you would communicate this message to the Secretary of State for War, First lord and the Colonial Secretary and ask them to consider it immediately.      The Kemalists indicate September 3Oth beyond which they will not wait,      I cannot help thinking that agood
good deal could be done In the few days at our disposal to hurry up material of this  kind.     The Turks abe rarely up tbdate and they codld not In any event bring heavy g\ms up for weeks and we could amass unmistnkeable superiority inmaterial before that happened, but no time should be lost.
