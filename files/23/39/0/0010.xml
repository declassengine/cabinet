UPPER SILESIA.

With reference to the Conference held the same morning (E.31-C), the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reported the latest developments in regard to the situation which has arisen in connection with affairs in Upper Silesia. 

Since the morning meeting, Lord Curzon had received a communication from the French Ambassador confirming that the previous Note (Paper C.P.-3172) had emanated from M. Briand himself, and adding a hope that the present conflict would result in a rupture of Anglo-French relations. This communication had been made by M. Briand in the belief that the Prime Minister was to make a statement in Parliament the same afternoon.

Lord Curzon had also heard from Berlin (Foreign Office telegram No.397, dated July 27, 1921)that the French Ambassador there had issued an ultimatum to the German Government to the effect that unless a categorical ? was given by midday on July 28th and facilities provided for the transport of a French Division to Upper Silesia, the French Ambassador would at once advise his Government to take the necessary steps against Germany.

He had also received a second communication from the British Ambassador at Berlin (Foreign Office telegram No. 398, dated July 27, 1921) to the effect that the German Government would not give way to these continual menaces and would accept all the consequences.

Information had also been received from Paris to the effect that neither Marshal Foch nor General Weygand had been consulted as to the need of an additional French Division in Upper Silesia. This indicated that the motives of the French policy were political rather than military.

Finally, information had been received that the Italian Foreign Minister had privately expressed the view that the despatch of the additional French Division to Upper Silesia ought not to be approved.


Raving read in full the eormunications on which theabove summary is based, the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs read the draft he had prepared of a Reply to the note of the French Government.Lord Curzon&apos;s draft was generally accepted as a firm and dignified statement of the British case.   The followingdrafting alteration was agreed to:-The word &quot;conflict&quot; should be placed ininverted conoras, or else the  French word&quot;conflit&quot; should be given in brackets.The general view of the Conference was that the trend of events was leading in the direction of isolated Frenchaction for the occupation of the Ruhr.The Conference were inclined to entertain favourablya suggestion made at the morning meeting that if France can-celled her invitation to a meeting of the Supreme Council on french soil we should consider the desirability of summoninga meeting in London,The suggestion made by the Prime Minister of Australia,that the dispute should be referred to the League of Nationsunder Article 11 of the Covenant, was reserved until a reply had been received to the Briti h Reply about to be sent.The suggestion was renewed that the Government of theUnited States of America should be kept an oourant with thecourse of events..Subject to the minor alteration referred to above,the Conference  (a) approved the terms of the Reply to the French note prepared by the Secretary of State forForeign A ffairs:
Cb* Invited the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs to notify the British Ambassador in washington of the geneitel position, and authorised him to ihfbira the American secretary of State that, if he were interested, we should he glad to furnishhim with detailed infoimation.The Prime Minister intimated that he must defer hi astatement on the subject in Parliament until a reply had beenreio^i^ejd to thw British communication.* * * *Whitehall frardens, S.1,July 28. 1921,a
