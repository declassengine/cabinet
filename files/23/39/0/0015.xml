STATUS It was explained to the Committee that the question forofMvKRASSIN. consideration was what reply should be returned to an enquiryfrom the Court of Appeal as to the status of M* Krassin.There had already been a base before the Courts,, which involved the ownership of Russian geld in this countryeThe case had turned on a letter to the Court from theForeign Office which had been written before the conclusionof the Trade Agreement with Russia,     The Court haddecidesd then that the Russian representative did not possess the requisite standing and that the Russian gold was, there-fore liable to be attached,&apos;    This decision was to a great extent modified in. a later case when further enquiry hadbeen made of the Foreign Office^     The present question arose in relation to the case of Fenton which was an action for the price of goods.     The plaintiffs had sought to joinMe Krassin a3 a defendant and the Master in Chambers had refused on the ground that M. Krassin had an ambassadorialatatus*   The plaintiffs took the case to a Justice inChambers who had sent it on to the Court of Appeale   before proceeding further the Court had asked the Foreign Officeto reply to the t^ro following questions:-(1)   Whether H,M* Government had had any dealings with Mo Krassin other than those on questions relating to trade;(2) Whether he had been received as Representativeof(the Soviet Government in any eapacity otherthan head of the Russian Trade DelegationsThe question was whether the Foreign Office should intheir reply state directly whether or not M0 Krassin was regarded by HtM, Government as a full representative of theSoviet Government, or whether an answer should be givensetting out the facts and leaving the decision as to M,    &apos;
Krassin1s status to the Court of Appeal.General agreement was expressed with the view that no direct statement of opinion should toe made by H.M*government as to the status of M, Krassln^ but that the facts should beplaced before the Court and the decision left to them.The proposed draft reply by the Foreign Office was read to the Committee, the effect of which was that Ms Krassin hadbeen received by H.M. Government solely in his capacity as chief Official Agent in connection   with the Trade Agreementalthough the opportunity had, been taken of his presence inthis country to disouss the question of the famine in Russiaand the exchange of prisoners.     The draft reply went on tostate that M, Krassin had never been received as Ambassadorby H.M, Government.     This reply, It was stated, represented the facts as known to the Foreign Office,     It would beimpossible to recognise M, Krassin as Ambassador because suchrecognition would carry with it recognition of the SovietGovernment as a de jure Government, Whereas the recognitionso far accorded to that Government had been more or lessthat of a de faoto Government.It was pointed out that in a case   of this Importance,the decision of which might involve the suspension of tradewith Russia since British traders would certainly refuseto do further business with a trading agent who had been declared by the Courts to possess diplomatic immunity from being sued, it &quot;was essential that the Court should have before it the full fact3 of the case.     As a matter of faot1,1, Krassin had on certain occasions been treated informallyas the representative of tho Soviet Government,       Discussions,for instance, had been held with him regarding Poland, and theWar Office had put forward in June 1920 various proposals fordiscussion with him regarding military matters.     The PrimeMinister had himself seen M,Krassin at the time of the discussions/ on
the subject of Poland when there had been a question ofa general European Conference,     The assent of theFrench Government had been obtained at Boulogne by thePrime Minister and Lord Curzon to the calling of 3uch aConference and definite proposals had been put beforeM. Krassin and H, Kameneff by the Prime Minister,The Committee agreedThat the Cabinet Secretariat should examine the records of the discussions with Ms Krassin and communicatedetails of them to the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs for inclusion ,of such as are relevant, in the replyto the enquiry from the Court of Appeal,2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.2nd November, 1921,
