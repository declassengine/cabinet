PEROR (l) The Secretary--or&quot;-State-for Foreign Affairs reported.tbatr-the-^^x^45I^peror Oarl&apos;s attempt to regain the throne of hungary had failed, and he was now imprisoned in an abbeyin Hungary.It was essential that he should be removed elsewhereat once from Hungary, where he was in a centre of intrigue.There w**r* strong political objections to his internmentin Italy, partly owing to the propinquity of Jugo-Slavia.A suggestion had been made that he shotild be takendown the Danube by Admiral Troubridge on board a british ship to Galatz.   By a coincidence,a British ship would short-ly bft calling at Galatz and could take him on to Constanti-nople, whence he could be transported to a temporary resi-dence pending the selection of a permanent home.As regards the temporary residence, one suggestion had been Malta.   This, however, would be peculiarly incon-venient at a moment when the Prince of Wales was about to visit that Island.   A better suggestion would be to remove himto Gibraltar pending the decision as to his permanent home.As regards this permanent home, the Allied powers had already been in communication with the Spanish Governmentwith a view to an asylum in Spain.   Spain, with the approvalof the Powers, had accepted in principle, but the negotiations were still proceeding in regard to details.   Gibraltar wouldbe a peculiarly suitable place as a temporary residence ifthe ex-Fmparor was likely to find permanent asylum in aSpanish possession.   In the Balearic Islands one of theAustrian archdukes possessed an estate, which might provesuitable as the ex-Emperorfs home.   The Canary Islands were a possible alternative.   In any case an island was desirable.Thftre was a short discussion in regard to the desira-inviolability or otherwise of the ex-Fmperor*s internment in aBritish possession, and the majority of those present were opposed to Great Britain becoming his gaoler.
After some further discussion the Conferenoe agreedThat the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should have discretion to arrangefor the removal of the ex-Tfeperor fromHungary.
