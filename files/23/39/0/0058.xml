1* With reference to Cabinet      ; (22)y GcTVJlhiei^n^ipthe-^Secretary of State for War raised the question of thefVossibility of reducing the &apos;number of troops in the near east pending the forthcoming Peace Conference.;   He explain-ed that one of the Battalions sent to the ConstantinopleCommand had boon proceeding to India on relief, and that ofthe Battalions now In the Near East four had their secondBattalions also abroad.   He was arikious  that those Battalionsshould, if possible,, be relieved, in order that he mightresume tho trooping programme:    otherwise there would soon&quot;bo a shortage of troops&apos;in India;If it was decided that the troops were to be main-talned at their present strength, it would be necessaryimmediately to make arrangements for hutting.   He did netpropose to provide for the hutting of the.troops in Constan-tinople, Ismid, Thrace, or chanak.Hutting accommodation had already been ordered for7,600 men on the. Gallipoli Peninsula, and ho now sought authority to order huts for 6i;000 more men, at a cost of 840,000,There were approximately 20,000 troops now in the near east, including 1^000 Marines.   There were three Battalionsat Constantinople, three Battalions in the Ismid Peninsula,three Battalions in.Thrace, three Battalions in Gallipoli,and three at Chanak.   Under his proposals, hutting accoramo-dation would be provided for 13,600 men at Gallipoli, and7,000 troops in Constantinople and Thrace would be leftunprovided for,   The huts already ordered would be ready atthe beginning of December at the earliest, and if a furtherox&quot;der was now placed those huts would be ready about threeweeks later,The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested that,, unless it was assumed that we- should be Ut war- with Turkey, thetroops in Thrace and in the Ismid Peninsula could be with-&apos;drawn and accommodated in Constantinople.    He agreed that
the correct policy was to maintain the strength of thetroops in the Hoar Fast until the Peace Conference hadtaken place, but he desired to urge the importance of notexpending money in tho erection of huts on the gallipoli peninsula that might never be used.   He understood thatthe military expenditure up to date v/as under  2,500,000,and the naval expenditure about  150,000.The Secretary of State for &quot;&apos;ar explained that the Britishtroops in Thrace wore taking over the Rodosto section ofthe line.   He had received a telegram from Sir CharlesHarington reporting that Rodosto was now full of refugees,that typhus was prevalent, and that the troops could not therefore be put in billets in Rodosto.   It was not, how-ever, proposed to provide huts for the troops in Thrace;they world be under canvas.    Sir Charles Harington was opposed to any reduction of the troops at.the present time,as he mistrusted the Turks!   His proposals included provi-sion for 1,000 men of the Air Force and 1,000 Marines atGallipoli, as well as for certain troops which would haveto bo moved fromChanak, where they were now under canvas .IHe considered that the provision for hutting 13,500 men was the minimum that could be agreed to with safety.A suggestion for tho appointment of a Sub-Committee toconsider th&apos; question of hutting was discussed, but theSecretary of State for &apos;-7ar did not press for it.It was agreed  (a) That no important reductions should bo madeIn the strength of the troops in the NearFast before the Peace Conference is con-eluded:.(b) That the provision of new huts should bereduced to a minimum.       The Secretary ofState for &quot;&quot;ar gave tho Chancellor of theExchequer a personal undertaking to securethai;, no unnecessary expenditure should be:5$fctfrred.
?DOM OF 2.. With reference to -Cabinet -52^-22)^^ppend.ix V (ll) ,STRAITS.Conclusion (K), in the course of the discussicn-cr^c-ordedin the preceding Minute, the Secretary of State for Foreign^Affairs raised the question as to what exactly wore thefunctions of the troops in the Near East.   He suggested-that,. firstly 9 they were there to prevent an infringementof the IVhidania Agreement, and it was clear that all theexisting forces were required for.that purpose.... He men-.,tioned that it was repbrted that there had been an infringe1-rnent of the neutral sorie by the Turkish troops on the IsmidPeninsula.Secondly, we required to have sufficient forces avail-able to resist such military pressure as the Turks might attempt to bring to bear upon us during the Peace Confer-enco.    It was quite possible that they might endoavotir,by a treacherous coup, to overthrow the Conference.Thirdly,.the view seemed to be held that by retainingour troops in Chanak and Ismid we&apos;, could ensure the decisionof tho question of the freedom of the Straits in the sensedesired by us.. It was neoessary to consider what exactlywas meant by &quot;the freedom of the &quot;straits&quot;.   If freedom of-passage for all mercantile ships was meant, no difficulty would arise in time of peace;    but if it was proposed to:ensure freedom of access for ships of war at all times^.soas to enable us to threaten Constantinople by naval actionin time of crisis,, he believed there was.not the remotestchance of our securing a decision in that sense at theConference, although it was desirable that we should en-.,d^favour by every diplomatic means to obtain such a decision.At the Conference, the issue would be between Great Britainand the rest of Europe.   The other nations would endeavourto prevent an arrangement which would secure to us theadvantage we gained by the possession of sea power.   Franceand Italy, would be opposed to,us, as would Russia and hersatellite States,, and&apos; other nations such as Serbia and
Rourcania.    No support was to be looked for from tbe otberPowers .    If we were now holding Chanak. with the objectof forcing a solution of the Straits question in accord-ance with our wishes, wo were suffering under an Illusion.Such -freedom of the Straits could only be ensured by large forces maintained on both sides of the Straits.    It wouldbe quite impossible for the league o^ Nations to ensuresuch a fre-dom.The Secretary of Statr for the Colonies suggested that  :hat we wanted, was to ensure that no batteries should- be erected on the shores of the Straits in time of peace.    he believed that the League of Nations could ensure ouch ademilitarisation of the Straits .    It was important thatthere should be&apos; no physical means of stopping our Fleetfrom entering the Dardanelles if a sudden crisis aroseand we 6/ eir d to bring pressure to bear upon the Turks 4
3. With reference to Cabinet 63 (SO), Conclusion 4,  theSecretary of State for War pointed out that, on i ay 17,1920, Mr Bonar Law, in the.House of Commons, had referredto a promise of a free gift of munitions of war to Poland.The Foreign Office were now&apos;urging that this premise shouldbe oarri -d out,Tho Lord President of tho Council observed that that&apos;promise must have been given before Poland and Russia were at war with one another, and he considered that the promiseshould bo regarded as having lapsede    He was not disposed to five free gifts of munitions of war to the Poles, whohad always been recalcitrant.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs disclaimedknowledge of the Foreign Office wish &apos;ror the free gift ofmunitions to Poland.It was agreed  That no decision should be taken onthe question.
O -finppLY OF WAR      4. With reference to Cabinet 58 (38), Conclusion 3,WftlAL TO : .JOUT-IAKIA. the Secretary of State for V;ar stated that at Genoathe Roumanian Government had ashed us to suppljr them withmunitions of war.    We had not complied with their request,and they had subsequently obtained some munitions fromFranco.    The Roumanian Government had recently sent overM. Diamandy to this country with a list of the arms andequipment&apos; which they-desired to obtain.   We-had consider-able stocks of surplus  stores, and ho  (Sir laming worthington Evans)  had, at the request of the Cabinet,seen M. Diamandy, who, had handed- in a list showing which of the requirements of the Roumanian Government we could provide from our surplus,    If we complied with their request so far as wo wore able, a sum of  500,000 in cashwould be involved.    He put forward the question purelyfrom the military point of view,  and he had not considered it from the Foreign Office or financial aspects.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that itwould be impossible to&apos; ask the House of Commons to vote 500,000 to provide munitions of war to Roumania,The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs statedthat the Foreign Office had up to now had no part in thediscussions with&apos;the Roumanian Government on this subject.The Roumanian Government had sent a Minister over toEngland while ha was absent in the country.   He had been seen by tha Prime Minister, who had made a suggestion-about the;provision of arms, and had forwarded to him an account of his conversation.    M* Diamandy had come tosee/him&apos; (Lord Ourzon) later, and he had replied that heiknew nothing of the arrangement that had been made .   Hehad dis cu s sed with M. Diamandy the Conference in Paris,and had informed him that, though his good offices, theRoumanian representative would be present at tha PeaceConference.    He had pointed out to       Diamandy that tha
Roumanian interests were the game as ours, and M. Diamandyhad undertaken to discuss the attitude that Roumania shouldtake at the Conference :&apos;ith his Prime Minister on returning to Roumania.He (Lord Curzon) had had no opportunity of considering this question, and he would like to consider it from theForeign Office point of view.    It was possible that itmight be worth while to spend some money to get Roumaniaon our side at the Peace Conference.   M, Diamandy haddenied that Roumania had undertaken any obligation to -Franc e.It was agreedThat the discussion of this question should be adjourned in order that theForeign Office might present theirViews on it.
5.    With reference to Cabinet 52 (22), Appendix V (5),Conclusion (e), the Lord President of the Council read aletter addressed by the Poreign Office to Sir maurice hankey, dated October 12, 1922, which is attached as anAooendix.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs explainedthat it was most urgent that we should provide the sumasked for. The lives of millions c* people were at stake,and we were under obligations to the Greek refugees, whosemisfortunes were in part due to the encouragement they hadreceived from us. He urged that the request conveyed inthe letter should be complied with.The Chancellor of the Exchequer observed that our offer of assistance was conditional upon contributions beingmade by other nations ,   His experience was that in such arrangements we were always left in the lurch by other nations, who seldom fulfilled their promises.   He was opposed to a continuation of the practice of making contri-butions on those terms.    The stores asked for had. a cashvalue.    Large surplus stocks were in existence, but theywere gradually being sold as the market could absorb them.It would be easier to contribute stores than cash, and if other nations contributed their quota,, as promised, he was quite willing to agree to the request? but on the condition that the  .10,000 was not in addition to the conditionalmaximum contribution of  506000 to the Nansen fund.   he pointed out, however, that the grant of money to the Greekr-fugees would have a repercussion as regards the treatmentof the refugees from Southern Ireland, many of whom weredestitute.    There was no Parliamentary answer to the charge that the Greek refugees were being given more favourable treatment than the loyalists from the South of Ireland.The Secretary of the Cabinet ask d if he should makea formal communication to the Secretary-General of the Leagueof Nations notifying the League that the total British
contribution would now not exceed  40,000.   As there appeared little prospect of the total amount of  50.000being subscribed by other nations, It wad consider-:! that&apos;it would suffice if the Secretary explained the positionprivately to Sir Eric Drurirond.It was agreed -- ..(a) That the grant of  10,000 worth of medicalstores to the various British relief organ-.&apos;isations combined under&apos; the name of the&quot;All British Appealtt should be sanctioned,this amount being deducted from the totalof  50,00.0. promised conditionally by his majesty&apos;s Government to the League ofnations for the relief of refugees in theHear Fast:(b) That the Secretary&quot; should write privately to the Secretary-General of the&apos; League ofNations, explaining, the position to him.
ARMISTICE 6* With reference to Cabinet 79 (21), Conclusion 10,^ &apos; at 12-45 p.m., after some Ministers   had l^ft, the PrimeMinister arrived from Buckingham Palace and said thatHis Majesty the King had spoken to him on the question ofthe observance of Armistice Day,   His Majesty had asked the views of the Cahinet as to whether he himself should attend a Service at Westminster Abbey.   The Prime minister had replied that Lord Curzon had in previous years under-taken the organisation of the Armistice Day Observance,and he would ask for his views.Lord Curzon said he would gladly consider thematter and&apos;advise the Cahinet,After a short discussion it was agreed to recommend to the Cabinet:-&quot;(a) That Lord Curzon should again undertake,on behalf of the Cabinet, the organisa-tion of the Armistice Day Observance:(b) That h- shoiild advise the Cabinet as towhether it was expedient to introduce into this observance a Service at westminster Abbey to be attended by theKing and his Ministers.lord Birkenhead, Mr Churchill, Mr Baldwin and captain Guest had left.     Lord Balfour, lord curzon, Lord Lee, Sir Robert Home and SirLaming Worthington Evan3 were present.
