(1)    THE SECRETARY OP ST/tTS FOR THIS COLOITIZiS informed the Conference that since his memorandum (CP.3515).was written he had had the opportunity of discusoinwthe situation with the Secretaries of State for War,India and Air.    They had no objection to the proposalput forward in the memorandum: unless, therefore,the Cabinet disagreed with the proposals, he - su,igep**ithat they should take note of the agreement reached between the three Departments.MR. FISHER pointed out that .it was desirablethat an attempt should be made to secure acceptance -the Palestine mandate by the League of Nations atnext meeting.    The   High Commissioner was much embarrassed by the absence of that approval.    Two obstacleswere in the way:    the negotiations with America onthe subject were not yet complete, and Italy had notyet been brought into agreement.It was pointed out that it was not likely that italy would give her consent until after the meeting with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs at paris on January 9 th.    If that meet in-; resulted in  paccommodation with Italy it was possible that she would agree to the mandate.The Conference:-Took note and approved of the proposalfor the garrisoning of palestine^nade by theSecretary of State for the Colonies, andconcurred   in by the Secretaries of Statefor War, India and Air.(2)    cabinet? SECRETARY OP. STATS POR THE C 0102-03 Sexplained that the question raised in CP.-3565was whether consent should be given to a suggest!oithat Pelsal should get into communication withNaji Bey and ascertain from him privately whatMustapha Kemal1s intentions were in regard to Iraq,
The Conference- agreed:-That there was no objection to Felsalcommunieating with ITaji Bey. provided itwas clearly understo-od that it was notwith the&apos; object of entering into negotia-tions with Kemal. but of discovering his attitude to Iraq,(3)    THE SECRETARY OP STATE PGR FOREIGB affairs explained that he wished to have the instructions ofthe Cabinet on this matter before proceeding to paris, where he had arranged to mee$ the foreign ministers of France and Italy on January 9th.   Hehad informed Mb Briand that he would send him inadvance the outlines of the proposals that he would labefore the Conference.   His proposals are set forth in CP.3671.   He explained that the situation had improved of late in two respects.   The relations ofthe Allies with one another were better, as were therelations between the Allies and the Angora government. Briand had. been severely criticised in Prance for making the Franklins-Bouillon treaty which it was generally reoognised was both unfriendly to Englandand was, in effect, a betrayal of the Armenians.   M.Briand had assured him that he believed that theAllies could now come to an agreement with Kemal,,The Greeks had placed themselves entirely in our hands oIt had become clear that the only terms of peaceacceptable to the Turk3 would be the total withdrawalof the Greeks from Asia Minor.   It was, hovrever,necessary tc secure the safety of the Greek population and Greek interests in.that region.   The alternative proposals set forth in column-4 of Cop. 3571 were explained.   Alternative forms of Government were&apos;proposed.   Either that set up In the Saar Basin wherethere is a governing commission appointed by theLeague/
League,.-of&quot;Nat.i.cm3j&apos;^he-Glaairman being appointed bythe League, or that set up in Lebanon where there isa Christian Governor   chosen by Turkey, with theconsent of the powers and immovable without thatconsent.     The Saar precedent was regarded as preferableas It brought in the League of Nations. -   It was thoughtthat the League of Nations would readily accept theresponsibility that vxmld be thrown upon it underthe Saar arrangement, provided that a satisfactorypolice force was established and paid for by the Turks,and provided no serious financial responsibility wasthrown upon the LeaguedIt was suggested that if the Saar system were adopted., the appointment of an American Chairman to theCommission would be advantageous in order to associateAmerica with the arrangement .made0As regards the areas, it was thought that theproposed arrangement that the area should Includethe Sanjak of Smyrna and the Kaza of Aivali was onthe whole preferable and that it was inexpedient tomade any reference to the arrangement proposed under(c) in the document communicated to 1:L Briand whowould probably communicate Britain^ proposals tothe Turks * .The Conference agreed  (a) As regards area, the third alternativein (c) should be omittedP(b) That ,the form of Government to be preferred should be that established in the Saar Basim(c) That the Greek forces should be vdthdrawnfrom Asia Miner., and that a localgendarmerie. the cost of which. should be-borne by Turkey should be established.for the maintenance cf internal order,(ID/
Western Thrace.

It was agreed that the question of Western Thrace should not be opened.

Eastern Thrace.

LORD CURZON explained his proposals for re-adjusting the Turkish frontier in Europe in order to allay the apprehensions of the Turks.

The Conference were reminded that the attitude of the Turks as regards Eastern Thrace had been coloured by their anxiety as to the safety of Constantinople from a Greek attack. If England and France would give a guarantee to secure Constantinople from attack by Greece, small concessions as regards territory would probably satisfy the Turks.

Several suggestions were made for a new frontier, including one that the frontier should run north from Rodosto to the Maritsa River and should follow the line of that river so as to hand over the territory on its left bank including Adrianople to the Turks. The general view was that such an arrangement would be unfair to Greece which was to be asked to make considerable sacrifices as regards Smyrna. Another objection to the proposal was that it would at once raise the Bulgarian question.

The Conference agreed:-

That the Turco-Greek frontier should be amended so as to run approximately from Rodosto to Malatra Burnu as proposed by Lord Curzon.

Constantinople and Straits.

LORD CURZON explained his proposals for the return of Constantinople to the Turks, for the reduction of the demilitarised zone, and the international occupation of the Straits.

The Conference approved Lord Curzon&apos;s proposals subject to the observations of the General Staff on their military aspects.


Armenia. LORD-TTTOZOl^xplajLned his. proposals0     Theywere briefly that an enclave should be created inthe South near the sea where, under guarantees ofprotection all the remaining Armenians should becongregated.     He admitted that it was possible1that this suggestion might not be practicable; but Itwas worth trying to do something for the Armeniansas to whose fate public opinion in England was much exercised.&apos; - -        -Lord Curzon&apos;s suggestions were approved.) Minorities. It was potnted out that as provisions hadbeen made in the Treaty of &apos;Sevres for the protectionOf the Mussulman minorities in Thrace, it was desirable that similar provisions should be-included in the new Treaty.) Tripartite It was pointed out that the Powers nowAgreement.realised that the Angora Government would neverconsent to a partition of Asia Miner into zones of special interest-      It was agreed that thisshould not be pressed, but that we should give assurances tc Italy and France that, so far as weare concerned, we would adhere to the policy laid down in the Tripartite Agreement0li)financial LORD CURZON explained his proposals as setCTausescforth in Column 4 of C?o3571.It was pointed out that it was very undesirable that we should incur the odium of imposing rigorousfinancial conditions on Turkey.      If we make no proposals both France and Italy will insist upon conditions more severe than thosewhich/
whi-ch&quot;&quot;TTOuld-satisfy ys *    In these circumstances we might with advantage leave it to Prance to put&quot;forward financial proposals.th3 PRIM?? MINISTER informed the Conference that from recent conversations with Bakhf-Sami Bey and with.the Indian Mahomme-dan deputation,, he realised thatthe financial clauses were regarded &quot;by the Turks asa matter of the first importancea   He thought our policy should be to leave the Turks independent in what remains to them of their dismembered empire.He was disposed not to put forward financial pro-posals *The Conference agreed:*That, we should not put forwardfinancial proposaia and that theInitiative in the matter should beleft to Prance6(4)    THE SECRETLY OP STATE FOR FOREIGK affairs undertook to revise his Memorandum in the light ofthe ahove discussion before circulating it to the prench and Italian Governments.(5)    The question was discussed as to hov/ the Treatyof Sevres in its amended form would affect publioopinion in India.   It was pointed out that thesituation in India would he greatly eased if india were allowed to he represented at the proposed conference in Paris.It was suggested that Aga Khan, who was nowin Paris, should be invited to be a member of theBritish Delegation,   It was not necessary that heshould be present at the meetings of the Conference;but it was suggested   that he should be taken intothe- confidence of Lord Curzon and consulted duringthe negotiations.   It was pointed out on tho otherhand/
 hand that Aga Khan was not representative of the main body of Mahommedans in India. He represented only a small section of the Indian  Mahommedan community.

The general feeling of the Conference was that the appointment of an Indian Mahommedan as a member of the British Delegation at the Conference in Paris would conciliate Indian opinion, Lord Curzon undertook to give the matter further consideration.

PROPOSED LOAN TO GREECE.

(6) MR FISHER informed the Conference that he had information that the Greek army was in a very bad state, desertions were numerous and the army would soon cease to exist as a fighting machine unless steps were taken to stop the process of deterioration. It was most desirable in the interests of the Allies that the Greek army should be kept in being until the negotiations with the Turks were completed.

It was stated that the question whether the Treasury should sanction the raising of a Greek loan in the City was now being considered. The Treasury desired to impose a condition that a certain proportion of any loan raised in Great Britain must be spent in England. It was understood that the Greeks had agreed to this condition as to four-tenths of the loan raised.

The Conference agreed:-

(a) It is desirable that the Greek army should be kept in being pending the completion of the negotiations with Turkey.

(b) That the Government wished to offer no objection to the raising of loans in the City by the Greek and Turkish Governments.

PROPOSED ANGLO-FRENCH ALLIANCE.

(7) A short discussion took place on a suggestion thrown out by M. Briand in a conversation with the Prime Minister and more formally in a conversation with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on

the/
