1.    In reply to an enquiry by the prime Minister, theCHIRP OP THE IMPERIAL GPHPRAL STAFF stated that one battalion had arrived in Gallipoli to-day and a secondbattalion would arrive on the 21st instant.    In addition there was now one British battalion at Chanak, ,togetherwith a quarter battalion of Italian troops. -THS; FIRST 3LA LORD reported that the Raval, Militaryand Air Staff had had a preliminary conference on thesituation that afternoon.    Before arriving at definite conclusions which they could submit to the Cabinet, itwas necessary for them to ask for certain information from the General-Offleer Commanding Constantinople.    Thetwo most important points to be considered were Chanakand the I amid Peninsula.    If Chanak could be held-, weshould thereby keep control of the   Dardanelles; andfrom a naval point of view the maintenance of our linesof communication and. a free waterway would not bedifficult.    In 10 days&apos;  time three more battalions willhave arrived, at Chanak.    That force ought to be able tohold Chanak pending the arrival of further reinforcements.It, of course,  lay with the Commander-in-Chief atConstantinople to decide as to tiie disposition of there reinforcements which were being sent to him.   He wouldprobably regard the retention of Chanak as most important,as it would enable him to   keep open the line of retreat.For that reason also it was likely to be one of thefirst objectives of the Turks.    If, however, the S.O.C.decided that the troops were required at Istrcid and thatChanak should not be held, the situation would be.  moredifficult.    He was of the opinion that the Ravy wouldhe able to keep open the Dardanelles even if the Turkswere at Chanak, although it would not be possible todislodge the Turks from that position- without a &quot;majormilitary/
military operation.    It would be possible to pass thesupply ships necessary for the force in Constantinople by sending them through the Dardanelles by night.    Asregards Ismid, it is unfortunate that we had constructeda good military road along the central line of the peninsula,    This road will be available to and of great value to the Turks;    It would however be exposed to thegun-fire of ships lying to the north and south of the peninsula which would make any position upon it untenable.Even if ^hanak were occupied by the Turks, he did not anticipate that there would be difficulty in wit.hdre.wingthe troops from Constantinople.    If necessary, they couldbe placed on board battleships for conveyance through theDardanelles.    The 6-inch howitzers from Malta would not reach Gallipoli before the 28th September *    Certain     delayoccurred through the necessity of fitting the ships forhorses.    The four battalions could not hold Chanak for any length of time against the force the Kemalists could bringagainst them.    For a prolonged resistance, two divisions would be necessary.    A force of 1;000 Marines fully equipped with ammunition and supplies would reach Chanakon the 29th September.TUB PRIME MINISTER enquired if it was absolutely necessary that the howitzers should be horsed.   He suggestedthat It was only necessary that they should be draggedup the hills to the position!? they were to occupy.THE CHIEF OP THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF was doubtful if it would be possible to get the 6-inch howitzers upto the Gallipoli peninsula.    Admiral De Robeck&apos;s reportseemed to show that nothing larger than 4-^-inoh howitzerscould operate on the peninsula.THE PRIME MINISTER/
Ireinforce-Is.THE PRIMES MINISTER requested that an enquiry shouldhe irfa;de as to the practicability of; getting the 5-inchhowitzers up the hills in Gallipoli.THE LORD CHANCELLOR enquired what was the earliest date at which a force of Turks equipped with heavy artillery could reach Chanak.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAPF stated thatsuch a force could reach Chanak in eight days from now,but a force of 7,000 Turks could reach Chanak within24 hours.2.      THE CHIRP OP THE AIR STAFF stated that the &quot;Argus&quot;had left for the East this morning and would reach theDardanelles in 10 days.   A squadron from Egypt would bethere by the 28th.    One squadron would leave Englandwithin 10 days and a second would, be ready to leave in 11days.    The &quot;pegasus&quot; Was now at Chanak and he had requested the C.I.G.S. to Ask General Harington forinformation as to the aerodrome accommodation available.There was an aerodrome at Constantinople which was occupied by the Prench and there were three aerodromes onthe Gallipoli peninsula which had been used by the Turks.He was making enquiries as to whether these aerodromeswere available.It was agreed:-(See Conclusion (e),.THE 3PCRETAPY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES stated thatit was very desirable that General Harington should bekept fully informed as to the reinforcements which it was proposed to send to him and as to the dates of their probable arrival--in. order , that he :might make plans fortheir employment.It was agreed:-(See Conclusion (a)).THE CHANCELLOR/
THE CHANCELLOR OE THE EXCHEQUER raised the questionSB- to whether hostile action should he taken against the kemalists as soon as they infringe the neutral zone.. The French had agreed with us that the neutral zone shouldhe preserved,    if the Kemalist fdrces advanced into the zone, it was an act of war.WARNING 3.    THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR raised the questionVIOLATIONHBUTRAL as to whether the High Commissioner at Constantinoplehad actually communicated to Kemal the views of theGovernment as to the maintenance of the neutral zone, whichit was decided should he communicated to Kemal by theAllied High Commissioners.    From the information that had &quot;been received, the French High Commissioner had.proceeded to Smyrna and It would seem that he hadreceived instructions from his Government.THE PRIME MINISTER read a telegram from constantinople which seemed, to imply that our High Com-missioner had. not received instructions -to - communicate with Kemal the views of the Government that the neutral zone must be maintained.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR, read a telegram which he had just received from General Harington, inwhich he stated that he was confident that Kemal wouldbe deterred from advancing on Constantinople by the promp action that had been taken to reinforce our troops.   his telegram gave details of his requirements which included a field company R.E. and some additions to the medicalestabli shme nt.THE LORD CHANCELLOR urged that the medical personnelshould be sent.It was agreed:-(See Conclusion (d)) ;
i ll03bciation 01&apos;jBAL(rIKGTONIS4.    The Conference expressed warm appreciation of the telegram and the prime Minister suggested that a personal telegram of appreciation should be sent toGeneral Harington, with which should also be sent afull explanation of what had been done, including astatement as to the assistance, that the Pleet wouldgive in keeping open the Straits and opposing an advanceof the Turkso    There was some reason to suspect thatthe French believed that we were bluffing, but it was desirable that it should be made clear that we were serious and it would be a good thing if it becamegenerally known in Constantinople of the action we were taking to send troops, aeroplanes and ships to demonstrate in Eastern Waters.It was agfeed:-(See Conclusion (b)).ITICNALMS SKIPSBE SENT5,.      THE, FIRST SEA LORD stated, that another cruiser squadron and another flotilla of Destroyers was proceeding to the East.    The Naval Commander-in-Chiefwas aware of this and as he was at Constantinople hewould no doubt have informed the General OfficerCommanding.THE PRIME MINISTER stated that a demonstration was of the highest importance as by a show of force and.,firmness it -was possible that fighting might be pre-vented.   He therefore suggested that more battleshipsshould be sent out to the East.It was agreed:*(See Conclusion (c)).THE SECRETARY/
WARNING TO MUSTAPHA KEMAL NEUTRAL ?E.

6. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES pointed out that our present forces at Chanak could only hold a small area of ground and even when reinforcements had arrived our front would be only three or four miles from the shore of the Dardanelles. There would, however, be no collision with the Kemalist troops when they crossed the zone but only when they came into contact with the force at Chanak. It was important that Kemal should be informed that the advance of his troops into the neutral zone would be regarded as an hostile act, so that our serial forces could act against the Kemalist troops the moment they infringed the zone.

It was agreed :-

(See Conclusion (g)).

?SIBLE ?SHEVIST MARINES. ---- ?SH ?ARINES ? SENT.

7. THE FIRST SEA LORD informed the Conference that he had received information that the Bolsheviks were giving naval assistance to the Kemalists by providing them with submarines, submarine chasers and minelayers in the Black Sea, and be enquired what action should be taken as regards these ships. For some time subsequent to the armistice, our naval forces had fired on all Bolshevik warships in the Black Sea. These orders had however been cancelled two years ago.

These craft would be a source of danger to our ships operating in these waters. He also asked for authority to send cut British submarines.

It was agreed: -

(See Conclusions (c) and (f) ).
8. THE SECRETARY OF STATS FOR 7JAR read a further telegram he had received from General Harington asregards the composition of reinforcements;   He also informed the Conferenoe that he had received a telegramfrom Lord Allenby to the effect that two cavalryrsgimehts and two pack batteries could be spared from egypt.9.       The GH1EF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF desired, toemphasise the fact that General Harington&apos;s plans were based upon tho assumption that he would have theoo-operation of tho Allied military forces in that region.(The First Sea Lord and the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff and the Chief of the Air Staffhere withdraw.)10.       LORD CDRZON pointed out that the attitude of theFrench at Constantinople was very different from thatof the attitude adopted by the French Government inParis.     Ho stated that tho jFrenoh Char go d&apos;Affaireshad called upon him that afternoon at 4.30 In orderto make a statement regarding M. Poincare&apos;s views.He adopted a curious procedure.   He explained that hewas not responsible for language used In the communication-tlon which he made as he was using the language conveyedin the instructions which had been given to him.He then produced two documents, the first was an instruction to him which he read rapidly In French.He then produced a second document which he Intimatedhe was instructed to read on similar lines.     As hewas reading the second document, Lord Curzon asked him for a copy which he refused to give.   He wa.s
apparently nervous as to the nature of hiscommunication and the language used.   He had jotteddown the following points from the second statement.Firstly, tho French Government were gravely surprisedhy the announcement of British policy which had; appeared in tha Press en Sunday.   Secondly, the French-Government took grave objection to the fact that thatannouncement had not been communicated to them inadvanoe and had not been prepared in consultation withthemv     The French anticipated the gravest difficultyfor themselves and for us as the result cf our policyin various parts of the world.   He then read a statementfrom his first paper to the effect that the french navy would tako no part in naval operations againstthe Turk and that the French Commander cad no authorityto oo-operate with us.     K. Poincare then proceeded iojustify the attitude which he had taken up by sayingthat he had told Lord Cur son in March that he wasunder an illusion as to the relative strength of theGreek and Turkish forces a    Thirdly, there was nofear for aggressive action on the part of Kemal andthat therefore the pre cautionary measures taken bythe British Government were not required.   Fourthly,the announcement of our policy was wounding to theTurks and to the Turkish Armyc    There then followedtha positive contribution of France towards&apos; thesolution of the orisi3 as follows.     Firstly, theFrench Government were prepared to agree to theprinciple of the freedom of the Straits and they agreeto accept the authority of the League&apos; of Nations orany other combination accep-table to the Turks1/Secondly, they ragarded it as irapoeedUhle in future
to refuse Turkish sovereignty over (a) the Gallipoli Peninsula,(b) Adrianople,(c) Smyrna,(d) they, adhered to the line of the Maritza as a frontier (that is, the national pact of Kemal). If these terms were offered to them, the Kemalists would accept them, but if we adopted a minatory attitude towards the Turks there would be a Turkish war throughout the world. Thirdly, they regarded our approach of Serbia as most unfortunate. The introduction of that volcanic element in a conference on a matter which was not of European interest would not facilitate an agreement. Fourthly, they considered it would bring the Greeks into military action against the Turks which would be fatal.   The French would not in any circumstances take part in any military operation with Greek troops. Fifthly, the French Government hoped that no irrevocable step had been taken by the British Government and that no further announcement of British policy would be made.

LORD CURZON added that he had expressed astonishment as to the nature of the language used in the communications read to him.  He read to the Charge d&apos;Affairs a courteous telegram which he had addressed to M. Poincare and added that he had not only telegraphed courteously to M. Poincare but had consented to go over to France to-morrow when he would pursue the discussion in Paris. It would be seen that the position as described by General Harington in Constantinople was very different from the political position in Paris. The French have abandoned the March agreement and refused naval co-operation and showed
a general reluctance to embark upon a policy whichwould involve them in hostilities, with the Turks andhad refused absolutely.to take military action inco-operation with the Greeks.MR. dHAMESRLAlB stated that it was clear that the .French did not desire the Balkan Powers to be consultedupon tho question of Constantinople and the Straits onaccount of tha pledges she has given to Turkey.    by her action she is in danger of losing her friendship with Roumania and had placed herself in a difficult position.   M- poincare found himself confronted witha unanimous British Empire *nd she foared that therewa3 a danger of her establishing a, now Gibraltar atGallipoli.THE PRIME MINISTER stated that it was clear thatM. Poincaro objected to our approaching the balkan states on the question because he desired to do sohimself to get them to come to the Conference on his ownterms.The question whether a formal communication shouldbe made to/the press as to tho action taken was discussed,     It --as agreed that no formal writtencommunication should bo made but that Sir Edward Griggshould see the representatlves of the press and makea verbal communication to thorn.tehall Gardens, S.W.1.September 18th, 1922.
inCOiaCLUSIOfcS OP A COMFBRBECE Cheld on Monday, 18th September, 1922at 5.0 p.a, in. regard to the position at Constantinople.The Conference agreed    :-(a) That the Secretary of State for &apos;7ar should notify to General Harington particulars of the various reinforcements - naval,military, and aerial - which are beingsentj together with the dates on whichthey should arrive.(b) That the Secretary of State for ^ar shouldsand a personal telegram (whether as partof the telegram referred to in (a) or asa separate telegram) to General Plarington,expressing high appreciation of the GeneralTsconduct and attitude in his present situationheartening him by reference to the reinforcementsbeing sent out by the Government, and giving him discretion to make such propagandaat Constantinople as he thinks expedientregarding the anticipated reinforcements to the fleet, army and air force, bearing inmind the importance at the present moment of a, demonstration designed to prevent-fighting no les3 than of tho actual increasein power.(c) That the Admiralty should reinforce thefleet in the Mediterranean by : -(i)    three capital ships*(ii)    submarines.(d) That the War Office should send a FieldCompany R.B., and additional medical personnel in addition to the reinforcements already approved.

Bnvt in view of r-- \forts roocivcdat the .idniiv.lty that&apos; Bolshevistsubmarines and submarine chasersand   mine-..laycrs arc to ho placed at tho disposal of tho TurkishNationalists,  the Admiralty should:inform the Nh,val Conmivndcr-ln-Chiofin the Mediterranean that any such.craft ap&quot;-&quot;c arinr  in tho Straitsshould ho attacked;    that any suchcraft approachin  the Straits ontho surface from&apos;the Black Sea under the Jhissian .flag,, should hp warnedoff;    and tiiat, in -the event of risk to any--.Allied ship from the approach of any,, such craft encountered in the black. Sea or Straits, It  should bosunk.      It was not deemed cspo&amp;icntto warn the Soviet. Government at.&quot;:!rcser.t of these intentions.
(g) That in order to ensure that there is no ambiguity regarding the right of the Allied Military Commander-in-Chief at Constantinople to take action in the event of the violation of the neutral xono by Mustapha Kemal&apos;s forces,  so that the delaying action of the Navy and Air Forces on a force approaching the Allied positions at Chanak and Mal Tope may be utilised to the full, the following measures should be taken :-

(i) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should telegraph to the British High Commissioner at Constantinople to enquire as to whether and when and in what terms the joint declaration was made by the Allied Hign Commissioner warning Mustapha Kemal that the neutral zone of the Straits must be respected by his troops (Cabinet 49 (22) (j)),

(ii) That the High Commissioner should also be instructed to confer with General Harington as to whether any further communication is necessary.

(iii) That the War Office should inform General Harington of the above communications to Sir Horace Rumbold and should give him corresponding instructions to confer with the High Commissioner as to what further communication is necessary in order to warn Mustapha Kemal that his forces will be liable to attack if they cross the neutral zone. The War Office should explain to General Harington that the First Sea Lord has advised the Cabinet that the Navy in conjunction with the Air Force, can probably deter and delay, though not prevent, the approach to the Allied positions of heavy artillery along roads within reach of the coast, and that it is desired that there should be no ambiguity as to the circumstances in which this power can be utilised.
