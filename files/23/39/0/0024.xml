THE LQRD PRIVY SEAL stated that he had ashed for a    -meeting of Ministers because he was gravely concerned-. .about the situation in India.    The telegram   from theGovernment of India as to the dangers and difficultieswhich confronted tham was so wholly out of accord.withthe suggestions now made by them for the reduction of thetroops in India that he considered it desirable that theposition should be discussed by Ministers before theIndian Military Requirements Committee went further into these questions.    The difficulties of the Government ofIndia were in a, large measure &quot;financial.    To enable themto balance their budget it would be necessary to increasetaxation, and every increase of taxation would make thepolitical situation more difficult.   The Viceroy, was anxious to make large reductions in the Military Estimates,In order to induce his Legislative Council to vote thebudget he was anxious to be able to announce to them areduction of the British troops and acceptance of thepolicy of the Indianisation of the Indian Army, &apos; He askedfor permission to notify a reduction of the British troopswithin a year, with a reservation that the Government ofIndia might be allowed to- retain the troops- temporarilyif the situation made it necessary.    Such a promise of reduction, subject to reservations, was of no use to theWar Office.   As regards the Indianisation of the Indian Array,the Government of India desired to be allowed to announce the scheme set forth in his telegram No. 113 of January ?.4,1922, (Paper CP,-3709), which provided for the total Indian-isation of the Indian Army in three stages of 14 years each.He regarded such a proposal as v*ry dangerous.    It was im-possible to foreshadow a military programme extending overa period of SO to 40 years.    It was impossible to foreseeevents more than onc; or two years ahead.   The proposals ofthe Viceroy were of a very formidable character;    and theyhad been approved by the Commander-in-Chief in India.
 Indians had been afforded opportunities to rise to any position in the Civil Government, but it must be  remembered that it was to the fighting classes of India to which we owed most. Till recently they were not eligible for King&apos;s Commissions. He had been anxious to remove that racial bar by granting King&apos;s Commissions to the few Indians who were competent to hold them. But the experiment of admitting Indian cadets through Sandhurst was not proving a success, as it was not easy to find candidates capable of passing the Sandhurst or Woolwich examinations, or of attaining the standard required from British cadets, and he saw no justification in our experience to warrant this large new programme.

At the time they were recommending reductions of the Indian Army, the Government of India had sent a telegram (Paper C.P.3713) foreshadowing various military situations they might have to meet. These included, firstly, a war with Afghanistan; secondly, serious and widespeard conflagration amongst the frontier Tribes; thirdly, sedition and disloyalty in the Indian Army, involving mutiny in portions of that Army; and, fourthly, internal rebellion, consisting of simultaneous co-ordinated outbreaks in several places. They had stated what their requirements in reinforcements from England would be in those contingencies. They had also expressed the opinion that a mutiny of the Indian Army was not anticipated so long as the present proportion of British officers was maintained.

The Government of Indian&apos;s proposals for reductions of the Army were not justified in view of their telegrams describing the general situation in India. He considered it desirable that the Secretary of State for India should send a despatch to the Viceroy setting forth the views of the Cabinet on the situation, and stating that in view of the telegrams they had received regarding the situation in India they considered it impossible to approve any further reduction of the white troops, or contemplate any such scheme of Indianisation as that put  forward by the Government of India at the present time.
In the discussions of the Indian Military Requirements Cam-       130mittee it appeared that in ths event of a war with Afghanistanthe first step would be for the British Army to advance toJalabad and the Government of India expected reinforcements to be sent from England to enable an advance to Kabul andKandahar to be undertaken..     At the present time the necessaryreinforcements from England were not availablet and the plans of the Government of India should be based upon that fact.     Itwas undesirable, thereforei that they should contemplate theoccupation of Jalabad or Kabul*      It had bean suggested thatoffensive action against Afghanistan should be taken by means-of aerial bombing, but the views of the General Staff and theAir Staff on that question were irreconcilable.     Opinion In theIndian Military Requirements Committee was tending to the viewthat military expenditure might be lessened by making full useof the Air Forcef but the Government of India, without waiting to learn the views 6f the Indian Military Requirements Committee,had announced their desire to reduce one of the two bombingSquadrons in India,     The whole position filled him with the, gravestanxiety;   and he felt that the Government of India were asking HisMajesty:s Government to take risks which they had no right to take.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA explained that the pol&amp;of the Government of India was that, having at least satisfied themselves that they had brought the thinking part of the popu--lation and the Councils to their side by a policy of patience^they now proposed to take stern measures against the extremists^  .They hoped that these measured would greatly ameliorate thepolitical situation in India within the next few months *     Thepresent financial position of India was appalling.     The nextBudget would cause a great sensation.     If the Government rejected the Viceroy&apos;s palliatives, it was certain that the Budget wouldbe thrown out, and that the Government of India would have touse the powers reserved to it to meet the financial situation , 50,000,000 of new taxation/
taxation would have to be raised.    It was proposed to       13(raise the Income Tax, Salt Tax, and Customs and Excise,but these increases would all be opposed by the Council.mhe view expressed by the Indian Members of Council wasthat British troops were too expensive for India, and that under existing conditions an expensive organisation and. ahigh standard of efficiency were not necessary.    In 1920Lord Ch.alms.ford had proposed to reduce the British troopsby 5 Battalions of Infantry and 3 Cavalry Regiments;lord Rawlinson, however, had dissented, and the reduction was not made.    In 1921 the Viceroy had appointed a committee under the Chairmanship of Lord Rawlinson, to report uponIndian military requirements.    In the Report of that Com-mittee Lord Rawlinson recommended the reduction to whichhe had in the preceding year refused to assent.    Owing totheir unsatisfactory relations with Afghanistan duringlast year, the Government of India had refused to assent tothat reduction, but stated that they would do so when condi-tions were more satisfactory.   The Government of India nowsought permission to inform the Council that the reduction could take place in a year&apos;s time. &apos; As Lord Rawlinson hadnot dissented, he himself would&apos;be justified in informingParliament that the proposal for that reduction had theapproval of the Oommandfir-in-Ghief in India.   There was,further,.a proposal from the Government of India for thereduction of one Bombing Squadron.    Owing to the difficult position in which Lord Rawlinson was placed as Member ofthe Executive Council, the Government of India did not receive from hi?&quot; purely military advice.    His militaryadvice was inevitably tempered by political and financial considerations.    He therefore discounted lord Rawlinson&apos;military advice- in assenting to these reductions,   Mr MONTAG&apos;was anxious, however, to be able to assist the Viceroy byassenting to part of his proposals, but he felt that to allo&apos;the Viceroy to announce a reduction of British troops, as
proposed, by him, would be - t^r hcro&amp;wlrik&quot;^^Council, because there was no reason to believe that thesituation in a year&apos;s time would be such as to enable thatreduction to be carried out.   He therefore suggested theViceroy should be informed that he could not be authorisedto announce the proposed reductions of British troops.&apos;Aa regards Indianisation, he reminded the Conference thatwe had promised Indians to assist them to establish self-government in Indian   He would not be a party to any newpolitical development until the Indians had shown that they,knew how to make use of a Constitution that had been grantedto them.    The view expressed by many thoughtful Indians wasthat they could never hope to govern themselves until theywere able to defend themselves.   They therefore asked us togive them opportunities of undergoing military training soas to render them capable of defending themselves.   Thescheme of giving Commissions to Indians through Sandhursthad not proved a success.   That scheme aimed at providingofficers fit to take their place alongside British officers for service ih all parts of the world.   Another difficultyof the present scheme was that it would result in Indiansbeing placed in command of Europeans.   The proposals now put forward by the Government of India avoided the difficultties of the Sandhurst training and the command of Europeansby Indians.If we announced that no further Indianisation of the IndiarArmy would be made^ the political situation in India would b:greatly aggravated.   The scheme now put forward by theGovernment of India had been worked out by the General Staffin India^ and was approved in principle by Sir Claud Jac-ob-the himself did not think the Cabinet could safely approveeven the first stage of the scheme?   but he thought theymight tell the Viceroy that he might announce that th&quot;. schon-was going to tp further considered.   He suggested that theSelect Committee of the House of Lords and House of Commons-5-
\- on Indian - Af fadrsriright - examdn-e^-that- scheme . and make recom-mendations in regard to it in due course,THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN.AFFAIRS stated that although the strength of the Army .in India should be fixed on nilitary grounds,- th* proposals now put forward by theViceroy arcs- out of the financial situation,  and their object was to enable him to pass the budget.   The real testwas what was the best machinery by which the safety of Indiacoxxla be assured.    The experiment of training Indian officers,to hold the King&apos;s Cotmission had not so far been a success.The broad fact could not be disputed that the Indian raceshad. not, as a rule, shown aptitude for leadership or ambition,for a ir.ilits.ry career.    The Viceroy contemplated a scheme under which 1,139 Indian- officers would be required in 11years, and nearly 7,COO in40 years&apos; time.    No such numbers,could be obtained.    He did not believe that the demand forIndianisation represented a real desire on the part of thefighting races of India.    Ha believed that it was a political,agitetion.    He was opposed to the scheme put forward by theGov.e,.-nr.v-nt of India, apparently as a sop to the Councils tosecure.the passage of the budget.   A more serious aspect ofthe question was that the Army in India was essential to thasecurity ,and the good adv inistration of the country.   Up to now the Indian Army was a highly efficient Instrument   aridits efficiency was due solely to the British officers serving&quot;in it.   The young British officers in the Indian Army had shown extraordinary &quot;capacity for inspiring the affection andrespect of their men.    He believed that the loyalty and theefficiency o*&quot; the Indian Army were bound up in the maintenanceof the British officers at their present strength.    In^a recent telegram the Viceroy had admitted that this was so.There was much disloyalty in India at the present time.   an indian Army officered by Indians might be a very grave dangerif if turned against us.   He urged that a suggestion that hadbeen put forward by previous Viceroys should now be adopted,
of the British officers, a few Regiments wholly officeredby Indians should be created.    The Indian officers enteringfrom the bottom would.gradually displace the British officers..Such Regime tit s might be formed in selected localities inBritish India, and the experiment could be extended if it proved successful.    He was opposed to reductions of theBritish troops in India at the present time.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES stated that inhis view the most urgent question in India was. the financialone.    India could not afford an expensive army or an expens-.ive administration.    Owing-to new developments and the rise of prices, the Army in India cost now two-and-a-half times as much as it did before thdWar.    This was a heavy burdento impose upon India.    He believed that the cost of theIndian Army night be reduced.    Before the ear the indian army was organised to meet an invasion by a formidable russian army.    That contingency need not at the present time be takeninto consideration.    The military view at present, was thatthe Indian Army should now be so organised as to enable it to invade Afghanistan and to advance to Kabul and Kandahar.He held the view that it&quot;would be madness to attempt to invade Afghanistan with, land forces.    He considered that pressure should be brought to&quot; bear upon Afghanistan byaerial bombing.    If our Army were entangled in the mountainousregions of our frontier, tbe troops would&apos; not   be availableto keep order in India.    At tho present time the first essential was the mintenance of internal order in India.Great changes had recently.taken place, and nothing in thepast afforded a guide as to the.present situation.    The indian army need not now be organised or equipped (1)  to meet a russian invasion:    or (3) to invade Afghanistan;    or (.3) toundertake military operations in the mountain regions beyond our borders.   The main object of the Army in India today wasto maintain British supremacy in India.    If the organisationof the Arm&quot;- was studied or, that b%dis, ho believed that
substantial economies could be effected by-reducing the A %ancillary services.As regards Indianisation, he pointed out that indian states now possessed State forces 20,000 to 30,000 strong,which were loyal and efficient, and it was significant thatthe Native States had at the present time a more encouragingaspect than the Provinces of British India, with theirelected Legislatures.   Personal loyalty to their Princeswas traditional in India, and he believed that the Stateforces would be much more likely to be loyal to their Rajahs&apos;than a regiment officered by Indians in British India to bsloyal to a Legislative Assembly..    He believed it would be a mistake to officer Indian Army regiments in British india by Indians.He raised the question as to the position of british rule in India.   An idea was prevalent among many people,both in India and at home, that we were fighting a rearguaidaction in India,       &quot; that the British raj, was doomed, andthat India would gradually be handed over to Indians.   Hewas strongly opposed to that view of the situation.   On thecontrary, we must strengthen our position in India.   Up to now the fruits of a policy of introducing democratic insti-tutions into India was that the Indians had turned against us at every stage, and they continued to make demands forfurther concessions.   He had supported the constitutional reforms in India, but he felt that they had received a greatsetback.   He believed that opinion would change soon as tothe expediency of granting democratic institutions to backwardraces which had no capacity for self-government.   He believedthat a way out of our difficulties might be found by extending the system of Native States, with their in-fluential&apos;&quot;aristocra--cies and landed proprietors.    That system would be in harmony with the ideas of Indians to whom Etiropean democratic inati-tutions were generally repugnant.THE LORD CHANCELLOR stated that he was astonished atthe inconsistency of the messages which the Viceroy had-8-
recently addressed to His Majesty&apos;s Government,   For-dnstaj^o-a,in one message, in discussing- the dangere&quot; &quot;In^Lndi^, he haddismissed the possibility of mutiny in the Indian Army pro-vided the establishment of British officers was maintained and sedition did not develop throughout the country, and in another message ha proposed that the British officers^ theguarantee of the loyalty of the Indian Army, should be. with-drawri, although the political situation was becoming worse.The inconsistency appeared to him to be quite incomprehensible.iTHE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR pointed out that the pro-posed reduction of 5 Battalions in India, subject to the reservation that they might be retained, was likely to place the War Office in a difficult position.   It would mean thatthe cost of 5 Battalions would be suddenly thrown on to theImperial Treasury.   If these Battalions and their 5 linkedBattalions at home were reduced, the Government would be unable to provide extra troops for India if the Government ofIndia asked for them in a few years&apos; time,THE LORD PRIVY SEAL stated that his Committee on indian military Requirevents was now enquiring into the question ofthe organisation of the troops in India,   He dia not believethat much saving could be effected by abolishing the divisionalorganisation, which was administratively economicy-l;   but he considered that some of the ancillary units of the divisionsmight be reduced.   He suggested that In place of the 5 worth-less Battalions which it was proposed to disband, 2 new Battat-ions officered by Indians, as proposed by Lord Curzon, mightbe formed as an experiment.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF EDUCATION expressed theopinion that the economic situation was the principal factor in the Indian situation.   There was also a widely diffusedsense of grievance among Indians that they were not given equalopportunities for advancement.   He.agreed that the opportunities of taking up a military career would not be widely availed of,but he considered that opportunities should be given,   Indianswould prefer to enter the Service through an Indian College,
as they were placed at a serious disadvantage at Sandhurstand Woolwiclu     He believed that the Establishment cf an indian military College., with British Officers and Staffs would goa long way towards meeting the discontent under this head0LORD LYTTOH stated that there appeared to be two mainpropositions: firstly, the question of authorising the viceroy to announce further reductions of British troops. andrsecondly, the question of Indianisation of the Indian ArmycHe was strongly cf opinion that it would be- inconsistent withour responsibilities to Parliament to authorise the viceroy to announce that further reductions of the Army in India were contemplated;,     Such reductions would only be justifiable Ifthe Government of India could show that the internal situation had substantially improved.     All their recent telegrams were.in the opposite sense.;Turning to Indianisation, he considered that the Governmentwould be taking a very serious step if they were to inform theViceroy that there was no hope of further progress as regardsIndian! sat ion a     There were two matters about which Indians feiitdeeply,?     These wero their political status and racial di scrim.-ination0     The number of Indians who cared greatly aboutdemocratic forms of Government might be comparatively small but the racial question affacted every Indian, and it would be inconsistent with the promises that we had made to Indiato announce that no further progress towards Indianisationof the Indian Army could he made,     He trusted that theGovernment would allow some more definite announcement to bemade than the bald statement that the matter was under ccnsid-eration.     He believed it would be safor to reduce the indian army In numbers while retaining Its present high standard of efficiency than to retain the present numbers and weaken theArmy by a measure of Indianisation applied to the whole of itoHe was opposed to Indianisation by a process of leavening.He preferred Lord Cursors suggestion that Indian Regiments,officered by Indians, should be formed outside the Indian Army.If the experiment were successful it might be extended.He was opposed to the reference of the question oflndianl-
sation to a Joint CcamaiJttree -of-^th^^ was a mat-ter--of policy for which tho Cabinet must &quot;be.....responsdhl^^-^They &apos;could not delegate the decision on a matter of policy to a.Committee, but there would be no objection to the Coimtdtteediscussing the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government.    He sug-gested that the Committee of Imperial Defence might considerthe policy of Indianisation in connection with their enquiry into the Indian military requirements.THE PRIME MINISTER read the following note by Sir maurice hankey of conversations which he had had with two experts whoaccompanied Mr Sastri to Washington;    one a soldier,  and the-.other a Civil Servant:- &apos;&quot;They gave me the impression that these militarychanges are essential if we are to hold India atall.    India, I gathered,  does not at present askfor separation,, but will very soon be led by agi-&apos;tators to demand it if we do not give a definitelead in the direction of Dominion Home Rule, in-oluding Indianisation of the Army.   The night I discussed these matters there was present a 7erybrilliant xoan named Rose, a former member of theBritish. Consular Service In China, who had lately been all throughlndia on business, and he assuredme that this was the view of the younger and keenerCivil Servants and soldiers.    I don&apos;1&apos;t profess toknowledge of this question, but I was profoundlyimpressed by these &quot;men.&quot;THE PRIME MINISTER said that the drift of opinion of the Minis-ters present appeared to be clear.   Firstly, they were opposedto the reduction of British troops In India until the situation onin India became more favourable.   The outlook in India was nowgrave.   The information he had by every channel confirmed that view.   The question was whether the discontent was likely tocome to a head and to need the application o^ military force,or whether discontent would continue to smoulder subject tosporadic outbursts like the recent riots,    If an outburst was likely in the near future it would obviously be a mistake toreduce the military forces now.    If a trial of strength came within the nert few months and tha Indians were shown that anattempt&apos; to overthrow the British Government in India was doomedto failure, a reduction might then be possible.    He had been impressed by the demoralisation of opinion among the CivilServants and the members of the European community.    This heattributed to a general doubt as to what was the policy of His
Majesty&apos;s Government *    The view that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentcontemplated withdrawal from India seamed to permeate theCivil Service, and there was a general feeling that opinion in a contrary sense could not he expressed from f&apos;--vr of dis-encouragement -from above.    That was a very unsatisfactory situa-tion.    A reduction of troops at the present tire could not fail to deepen that impression and-have a bad moral effect.    Thesame impression was to a certain extent prevalent in England,where there was a general feeling that we were weakening ourgrip upon India,   As regards Indianisation, it was clear thatthe scheme sanctioned during the War was not- proving success-ful.    An Indian Army officered by Indians would be a muchgraver danger in the event of a mutiny than the present indian army.    He was desirous o &quot; b^ing helpful to the Viceroy, butfound it difficult to n.ake alternative proposals,The trend of. opinion of the Conference was  (a) That no announcement of a reduction of theBritish troops in India, immediately or inthe future,  should he made;(b) That the Government of India&apos;s scheme for theInd.ip.nis at ion o &quot; the Indian Army could not be sanctioned at present in the light of informa-tion received from the Government o,? India asto conditions in Infli..1,  and in view of the factthat the Viceroy had stated that the loyalty ofthe Indian Army dep^nd^d upon the retention ofthe present proportion of British officers.THE SECTARY OE STATE FOR INDIA requested that ther- righthe a further consideration of th*&quot;state of India by the Confer----nce before Tuesday next, when there will he a discussion on india in Parliament.    Fe proposed to lay before the conference the draft- 0:&quot;* a telegram which he proposed to send to theViceroy.ball &apos;Gardens, S .-&apos;*.!,ehruary 9,  1922.
