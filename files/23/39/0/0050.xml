1. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES informed the Committee that before the Dail rose on the previous evening the clerk had read a Resolution, for the terms of which see Appendix I which gave to the Provisional Goernment and the Nationalist Forces very large powers to enforce public orders, and to punish crime. In effect the forces of the Provisional Government would in future be responsible for the maintenance of order; Military Courts, on which there would be legal representatives, would be set up to deal with all kinds of offenses committed by the Irregulars, and these Courts would have power to inflict penalties of fine, imprisonment and in extreme cases, death. In short the action of the Provisional Governement amounted to a proclamation of Martial Law of a most sweeping and far-reaching character. The Dail had approved the Resoultion in principle and would consider it in detail to-day.

The Conference took note of this satisfactory evidence of the intention of the Provisional Government to act in a resolute manner in regard to the maintenance of public order in Ireland, and the suppression of crime.

2. THE LORD PRIVY SEAL informed the ? that that afternoon he had been present at a meeting of Ministers at the Colonial Office at which the secrtary of State for Foreign ? Affairs the First Sea Lord, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and the Chief of the Air Staff had also been present. This meeting had been before them General Harington&apos;s telegram Nos. 2468 &amp; 2469 (C.P.4234) (his personal telegram to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff).

In addition there was a telegram from Sir H. Rumbold No. 466 indicating that the reply of Mustapha


Mustapha Kemal was unsatisfactory, and General Harington telegram No.2479 stating that he was in touch with Mustapha Kemal. Lord Caven had informed the meeting that the position held at Chanak by the British forces had a perimeter of four miles only and was so situated as to give no elbow room for deploying reinforcements as and when the latter arrived. Moreover, it was uncertain whether it would be safe to land the reinforcements at Chanak in face of Turkish opposition, and it might be found necessary to land the troops on the North shore of the Gallipoli Peninsula, or outside Gallipoli altogether. There was no doubt however that a landing at Chanak itself in force presented very considerable difficulties. The British forces could hold out at Chanak for three or four weeks and it was held by Lord Beatty that the troops could be reinforced, evacuated or relieved at the expiration of that time, but undoubtedly the position was a very cramped one and from the military point of view it would be difficult to hold if the Kemalist forces occupied certain high ground in the immediate neighbourhood of Chanak.

THE LORD PRIVY SEAL continuing, said that Lord Beatty would deplore a British Withdrawal from Chanak as this would make the Naval work in the Dardanelles and the Sea of Marmora very much more difficult. The Navy could assure the landing of reinforcements at Chanak though no doubt some losses would be incurred. Lord Beatty had added that the artillery fire of the Turks on the high ground could be kept down by British artillery reinforced by Naval fire. On hearing this view Lord Cavan had said that the troops at Chanak would be in a hollow commanded by surrounding high groud, and that it would be very difficult to deploy the reinforcements so as to drive the Turks out of the commanding


commend in   positions.    As there- appeared&quot;&quot; to- be&quot;&quot;-a. -dirver-gence-of views between the Military and Naval Staffs, the lord privy Seal bad requested Lord Beatty, Lord Cavan and SirHugh Trenchard to consult together and report&apos; to thepresent meeting on the questions at issue.     The Britishtroops at Charak numbered 5,500 sabres and bayonets, twopack batteries would arrive to-morrow (September 28th),one 6&quot; Howitzer Battery and. 1,000 Marines would arrivenext Saturday;    a Battalion would arrive on the 3rd October,and three other Pattolions on the 9th October.   The Turkswere reported to have 23,000 rifles and sabres in theneighbourhood..   A telegram had been dispatched to general harington asking him whether the hills in the neighbour-hood of Chanak had boon in fact occupied by the British,and if not, whether it would riot be possible for him tcoccupy them now,TFT ^IPST LOPD OP THE ADMIRALTY pointed out that effective air reinforcements had arrived.   The &quot;Argus&quot;and the &quot;Pegasus&quot; were On the spot and 15 aeroplanes atleast were available.T^ip. PRIME MINISTER did not consider that MustaphaKernel&apos;s telep-ram was very disconcerting,    It seemed to him the complaints In It were mainly directed towards the greeks.   No doubt he was very bitter against the British,and certain of the statements made by him such as, thatthe British had fired upon Nationalist Forces, were obvious-mis-statements.    He was not so much disturbed at the idea that the C^anak position was commanded by the neighbouringhilla, and-in this connection he instanced our experiencesin France and Gallipoli where we had often had to holdpositions commanded by the enemy on neighbouring highgroundsrprn? SECRETARY OF staff ^OR r&apos;AR assured the. Committee/
Goni3x.on.eothat there was abundance of ammunitionavailable--on the- spot or on the way for the British.SECRETARYiSTATE FOR&quot; co toriesIfffativeIn.3, THTT SECRETARY O1&quot; STATV &quot;OR TUP COLONIES saidthat he was very uncomfortable at the restricted posit3.0:0held at Chanak.    It was only on receipt of GeneralRarington&apos;s telegram No, 2415 that he had realisedfor the first time that the perimeter of this position was only four miles a-   He then read some notes which heas a basis of discussion had drafted of a purely tentative character/the generaltenure of which was as follows:-  .The British Governmenthad never taken up the position that Chanak was to beheld at all costs,    -bat had been decided upon was thatGallipoli was. of prime importance, then Chanak as anoutpost of Gallipoli, then Constantinople, and lastlythe Ismid. Peninsula,
In the event of serious fighting taking place it would be necessary to mobilise, and in this event two Divisions would be despatched from Hagland, and the first units of these Divisions would begin to arrive in the Dardanelles in 3 week&apos;s time. It was only if the hills surrounding Chanak were seized and held that the Chanak position would become a true bridge head. Merely to hold the low ground of Chanak would serve no very useful purpose. 

In the deplorable event of it being necessary to evaucate Chanak the Government should be seized of an alternative policy. A possible policy would be to withdraw the troops, except those required to hold to Gallipoli Peninsula to Constantinople. The British being in possession of the interior lines of communication could bring the troops round to Constantinople very much more quickly than the Nationalist Forces could get there by land. If it became necessary to evacuate Constantinople, the whole of the British forces could then be withdrawn from that city and concentrated on the Gallipoli Peninsula. This plan involved no serious risk, and had the very great merit that it would mystify, confuse, and hold up the enemy. He was advised that the troops from Constantinople could regain the Gallipoli Peninsula, either by sea or by landing at Rodosto, and then marching through the Isthmus into Gallipoli.

As regards the Fleet, he was in favour of maintaining a squadron in the Black Sea as long as possible. In the last resort it was a matter for consideration whether the squadron might not be left in the Black Sea, being based for the time being on the Roumanian ports.

THE LORD PRIVY SEAL

The above is only a very bare summary of the first part of a careful appreciation, the text of which is not at the moment available


THE LORD PRIVY SEAL pointed out that the First Sea Lord had absolutely declined even to consider the possibility of leaving the British squadron in the Black Sea after Constantinople had been evacuated.

 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES, continuing said that he was still of the opinion that the successful defence of Chanak was the best policy that could be adopted. Finally, he thought that General Harington should be informed that if the Turks attacked seriously at Chanak, it was the intention of the British Government to mobilise and call for volunteers, and in this connection undoubtedly Australia and New Zealand would provide a very considerable help. Moreover, the Greeks would be a factor to be taken into account. If Great Britain was forced to fight she must obtain help from every quarter, and in the event of Veniselos returning to power in Greece, public opinion in this country might be much more favourable to the Greek cause than it was at present.

 THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY expressed the personal opinion that it would not be practicable to move the British troops from Chanak to Constantinople, and from Constantinople to Gallipoli, in the expeditious manner comtemplated by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.

 THE PRIME MINISTER hoped that the Conference would not too readily accept the theory that a 4 mile perimeter was indefensible. The advantages of a short perimeter were obvious. It would enable the British heavy artillery to be kept on the Gallipoli Peninsula, and this would in itself very much facilitate the evacuation if hereafter this became necessary. If, however, the perimeter at Chanak was to extend to 15 miles, it would be necessary for the heavy artillery to be stationed in the Chanak area. Moreover, to hold/ 
 to hold a 15 mile perimeter would require very large forces. After repeating that our experiences in the late war did not bear out the theory that it was essential to hold high ground commanding British positions, he said he thought that before any further instructions were sent to General Harington, further detailed discussion would be necessary. 

 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR remarked that a small perimeter was being held at Chanak, because before reinforcements arrived only a single battalion was available. As the reinforcements arrived it was essential that the officer commanding Chanak should have sufficient elbow room. Colonel Shuttleworth was not in favour of enlarging the perimeter so as to include the high ground because of the height of the hills and the difficulty of victualling and maintaining an increased number of troops.

 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES thought that the ? should hear the Chief of the Imperial General Staff on the subject. The view of the army staff was that General Harington could hold a 4 mile position at Chanak, but the position so held would be of no real use as a bridge head, since reinforcements when landed could not be deployed. In these circumstances it might be preferable to land the reinforcements at some other place, and bring them up to attack the Turkish positions in the rear. Moreover, it should be remembered that by only holding the 4 mile perimeter, the whole of the rest of the shore of the Neutral Zone would be in Kemalist hands.

 THE PRIME MINISTER remarked that the Navy had said that it could make the coast roads unusable.

 THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that Admiral Beatty had not gone quite so far as this. Naval action could delay/
could delay the approach of Turkish troops along the road, and with Air Force assistance could make it very difficult for the Turks to bring up heavy artillery.

THE LORD PRIVY SEAL reminded the Conference that Lord Beatty had said that the Navy could cover the evacuation of Constantinople, but that it was for the Army to provide transport. He asked that the War Office should ascertain that the Military Authorities understood their responsibility in this respect.

??? 4. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES drew attention to Lord Hardinge&apos;s telegram (No.482) suggesting that Great Britain should offer to evacuate the Neutral Zones if Mustapha Kemal would give an assurance that the Kemalist troops would refrain from entering the zones.

THE PRIME MINISTER thought that the evacuation of Chanak, having regard to all that had happened, would be the greatest loss of prestige which could possibly be inflicted upon the British Empire. World public opinion was disposed as it was to regard our agreement with France as a defeat for Britain, and if in addition we had to scuttle from Chanak, our credit would entirely disappear.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES agreed, adding that there could be only one more disastrous event, namely, a British defeat at Chanak involving compulsory abandonment of that position. THE POLITICAL/
RaX       5. THE SECRETARY OR STATE POR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said thatfis OF?R0BLEJi. he proposed to speak oh the political aspects of the sit-iuation.   He agreed that until the Government were in posd-ess ion of Mustapha Remains reply that it Would &quot;be premature to come to any definite decisions.     On the whole he (lord curzon) was hopeful that the reply would not he altogether un-satisfactory.     While, no doubt, Mustapha kemal did not loveGreat Britain, he was wise enough to refrain from attacking the British Empire in his own interests.   Moreover, theFrench and Italians vrere undoubtedly doing everything theycould to prevent a breach.     Here again their action $wasdictated in the interests of France and Italy, and not.be-sympathy ; hr..cause of any with the British point of view.     As&quot;regards the policy of holding Chanak, he was in.-favour ofthe retention of that position so long as there was areasonable chance of success.     He did not, however, holdquite such strong views on the necessity for the retentionof Chanak as some of his colleagues.     In the first placehe was very much alarmed at the possibility of a war breakingout on account of our refusing to evacuate the neutral zonesouth cf the Dardanelles.   - This would involve mobilisationand the calling out of volunteers, and he wa3 very doubtfuAwhether, in the long run. Great Britain would obtain posi-tive advantages from an outbreak of war.     It was necessaryto bear in mind the repercussions of such an event through-out the V/orld, and the Government would,. he feared, get*    very little support for a war, either in the Country or inParliament....9. . *   -
parliament.     No reliance could be pladed oir:tJre*lrToJ4 ieu^assistance, while the political-consciences of acceptingGreek help would he disastrous.     No doubt the dominions would be prepared to put up tens of thousands of men inthe defence of Gallipoli, but he was doubtful whether theyWould be so ready to help to defend the Chanak position.The Secretary of State for! the Colonies had made a suggest-&apos;ion involving a retirement irT^eertaih eventualities to constantinople.     He (Lord Curzon) was much attracted bythe idea of retiring to Constantinople rather than to^Gallipoli.     Prom the political point cf view he would be&apos;very sorry indeed to see Constantinople evacuated.THE PRIME MINISTER, intervening, said that he had always assumed that General Harington would hold bothConstantinople and Chanak.LORD CURSON, continuing, said that the evacuation ofConstantinople would mean the breaking down in that partof the world of the Alliance.  General Harington was not onlyin command of the British troops, but he was tho AlliedCommands r-in-Chief at Constantinople and he could not with-draw the British forces without prior consultation with hisPrench and Italian colleagues.     In Paris he (Lord Curzon)had argued on the basis of allied unity on the -Europeanshores of the Dardanelles and Bosphorus.     Great Britainxsdeparture from Constantinople would bring such unity to theground.     If Mustapha Kemal got to Constantinople all chanceof a Conference would be at an end, the Sultan would bedeposed, his son would succeed him with Mustapha Kemal asGrand Yizier, and the Kemalists would then undertake a campaign in Thrace.     All the work of the proposed conference would....
would be done in advance. Thrace would be occupied by a Turkish Army which might not, of course, stop at the limits even of Western Thrace. Great Britain would be left at the Gallipoli Peninsula holding a kind of second Gibraltar.

The evacuation of Constantinople would have serious repercussions on our Eastern Allies.

The Roumanian Minister in London had seen him (Lord Curzon) that day and had thanked him for the efforts made by Great Britain to obtain Roumanian representation at the Conference. He (Lord Curzon) had told the Minister that Constantinople might be in danger, and the Minister had replied that this information would profoundly modify the views of Roumania as he appreciated that with the Turks in Constantinople no Conference could be held, and Roumania would have no opportunity of submitting her case. In these circumstances he urged that Great Britain would be in a hopeless position if she retired at Constantinople.

THE PRIME MINISTER expressed himself as inclined to agree with the views held by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.

THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that he was very doubtful as to the possibility of holding Constantinople if Chanak had to be evacuated.

(At this point the First Sea Lord and the Chief of the Air Staff entered the room. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff entered a few moments later.)

?-? CHANAK OF THE MILITARY AND AIR ?

LORD BEATTY informed the Conference that the Naval, Military and Air Experts had met and had discussed the question of...
of the retention of Chanak in the light of the most recent telegrams from General. Harington, and particularly general harington&apos;s statement that the evacuation of Constantinoplewould he necessary if Chsnak was to he securely held.The Committee should remember that General Harington had never aoubted his capacity to hold Chanak.     The Naval,Military end Air Staffs agreed that Chanak could be held forthree of four weeks (after Constantinople had been evacuated)with the forces at present available.     With the assistanceof the Air forces, the British artillery, on land and sea could;&apos;prevent the Turks from bringing up and working heavy guns.    Inthis matter the Navy could render very effective help, as theground at Chanak lent itself to such an operation.     AdmiralBrock had, in fact, so advised. /On purely military grounds there were no reasons^for theevacuation of Chanak, but the Turks must not be allowed tobring artillery into the neutral zone     Up to the present, A.there had been natural reluctance on the part of the MilitaryAuthorities on the spot to interfere with the Turkish Cavalry,but it would bo most dangerous if the same latitude was extended to Turkish artillery. The Naval,. Military and AirStaffs were in agreement that the reply to General Harlngtonshould say that the determination of the British Government tohold the Chanak position necessarily involved the evacuation of Constantinople.     If it was decided ^o hold, both Chanak andGallipoli against any attack, two Divisions would be required,.and the first Units of these Divisions&apos;&apos;would begin to arrive inP-,  ,from, the day- the order was given to mobilise *days time;    there was no doubt that the first Turkishattacks on Chanak would be repulsed, probably with heavyb looserWhether..
Whether British r e in   orcements should, land at Chanak or- else---where would depend- very much on the nature of the Turkishattacks, and on the character of the Turkish repulse.     Itshould he home in mind that the forces now. available couldonly hold Gallipoli and Chanak, and could not control the rest o:neutral a one on the so^athern shore of the Dardanelles.THE PRIMS MINISTER enquired when the contemplated evacuated-ation of Constantinople would take place.LORD BEATTY replied that this would have to he done on aserious attack by the Turks on Chanak developing.THE PRIME- MINISTER enquired when such an attack was likely to develop.lord CAVAH thought it was very difficult to say.     The ,Air reconnaisance reports were not sufficiently definite togive precise information,, but the Zemalists might be so elatedwith their recent successes as to contemplate rushing theChanak ttosition without proper artillery preparation.     Ifthey did so they. would meet with a very serious repulse, andthe British forces could then seize the two commanding hillsand enlarge the perimeter of the position.In reply to the Prime Minister &amp;ORD BEATTY said that he assumed that the coast roads to Ch&amp;nak were subjected to navalsearch lights at night,,SIR H. THEN CHARD, informed the  Conference that the aircraft were ana or the command of the locil Naval and Army Commanders,-and it iu probable that, they have not ordered them to proceedouts id o tho noutx-il. zono., ,!13.. &apos; ^ M*
No doubt on dark nights it would not be possible &quot;to detectthe movements of Turkish troops, &quot;but the movements of suchtroops could be readily ascertained by daylight reconnaissance-.THE LORE PRIVY SEAL said that he would like to askLord Beatty a question on a a basis opposite to that which theNaval; Military and Air Experts had just been considering. .Assuming that the British Government decided to evacuate Ghanak.&apos;and retire to Constantinoplo^ could the Naval commands-in-   1 -Chief at Constantinople guarantee the transport through v-the Dardanelles and the Sea of Marmora of the necessary supplies,reinforcements, otc. for the Army at Constantinople.   In thisconnection it should be borne in mind that the transports wouldbe manned by civilian crews, and that Constantinople-wouldprobably be a centre of Turkish disturbance^LORD BEATTY said that he would assume that the southernshore of the Dardanelles was held in forate by the Turks.   Ifthis was the case very considerable risks would attend thetransport of supplies, reinforcements, etc. to the Army in constantinople.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL then enquired whether it would be &apos;practicable to hold Constantinople and Gallipoli but not Chanak,victualling, etc. the force at Constantinople possibly bylanding supplies in the Gulf tff Saros      transporting themacross the Bulair Peninsula and shipping them to Constantinopleacross the Sea of Marmora.LORD BEATTY thought that no doubt this would bepossibjto,but that the process would, be very slow  and extremely
difficult.   we. hiivo &quot;no v&amp;ana of diaonb Marking or ofrr-ombirking o-\:xgdc8*TIE&quot;&quot;SECRETARY OR STATE I?OR WAR Reminded the ^onfcr^ricothat the main reason the Government had decided to hold theChanak position was that the &quot;Naval Authorities had advised that unless this was d,one it would not be possible to getunarmoured ships through the Straits.15,

He suggested that the reply shou 1 d i^ake^he&apos;form of promising a further telegram on the next day,and should ask his views as to Lord HardingeTs proposalfor the mutual evacuation by the British and Turks ofthe neutral zone.THE PRIME MINISTER was very doubtful as to this  &apos;proposal.     The Dardanelles could not be held unlessGreat Britain commanded both shores.     If we were to retire from Chanak we should be In a very weak positionand should have made a concession which would render it very difficult for the Secretary of State for foreign affairs to maintain the British position at the forth-coming Conference.     Mustapha Kemal&apos;s assurances on amatter of this kind would be worthless.     He might behere to-day and gone to-morrow.     Lord Hardingersproposal no doubt emanated from Prench sources.     let the Prench put the suggestion to Mustapha Kemal and let the latter, if he thought fit, submit it to GreatBritain.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES thought itwas feost ijSgeaErehle at the present juncture to send anytelegram which might have the effect of discouragingGeneral Harington.It was agreed(See Conclusion (a)).8,     THE PRIME MINISTER said he would very much like toknow what the military position of Greece v/as and how many Greek troops there were in Thrace..   THE SECRETARY OF STAT? FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat in Paris he had been told by the War Office that in r-16-Thrace/
Thrace the--Greeks had -54^GW*:r^^ ButIt must he remembered that recent events had v^ry^Tnu^tu.shaken the morale of the troops.THE PR IMS MINISTER- thought that as regards moralethe revolution would have made  a substantial difference.He would like to see an appreciation of the position by the War Office.     The Greeks had fought well a &amp;earago but thOy could not be expected to fight under their recent military coimnanders.     He would also like toknow how many Greeks there were at Mitylene and whataeroplane resources the Greeks had-.The Committee agreed(See Conclusion (B)).9,      THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR drew attention tothe terras of a telegram No. 2466 from General Haringtoncomplaining that the recent articles in the &quot;BallyMail&quot; might have a very prejudicial effect on the minds of the rank and file.It was agreed(See Conclusion (c)).10..   LORD BEATTY read to the Committee a telegram, fromthe Naval Commander-in-Chief dated Sop^bembor 26th, No.415 stating that in view of tho altered position GeneralatHarington did not propose to resist/Ismid but to evacuate if attacked in force and return to Gallipolisince it is impracticable to conduct war from theenemy&apos;s capital.  Ii  the absence of land forces, naval action by gun-firo would have little effect and would only delay if the Nationalists advanced, while unsup-ported naval attack would cause reprisals to be madeon the Christian population of Constantinople.,    AdmiralBrock thought that Natlonalist penetrationinto/
into Enropefen-ould. not be prevented once tbe military&apos;&apos;loavo Ismid and he did not recommend leaving a squadron in the Black Sea.     The only sound policy was to retireto the Dardanelles and to conduct military operations from there.     Prom this telegram it was clear that bothGeneral Harington and Admiral Brock had given.up allidea of holding Constantinople against Turkish attack in force.,Whitehall Gardens, S.F,88th September 1922.
