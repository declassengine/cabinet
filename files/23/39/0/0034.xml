$ORDER 0?       (l) The Conference met to give &quot;further c^neJLd^ratrionMARSHALHENRY        to the Questions discussed at the Conference of Ministers.100 THEUSED A07ERNMENT&quot;7ANT.ITUDE OPROUSECOMMONS .held on the previous day, together &quot;with certain other questions dealt with below.(2) The Conference were informed that one of the accusedmen was a Government servant, a Messenger in the Ministryof Labour.    He had served in the War and had lost a leg..In July, 1918, with very strong recommendations from hisColonel and a letter from a clergyman, he had been taken on as a Messenger in the Ministry of Munitions.   When theLabour Department of the Ministry of Munitions was trans-ferred to the Ministry of Labour he had passed to thelatter Department with it,   Hi3 record was unexceptionable.All the evidence in regard to him was that ha was a quiet,respectable man.   He had given the name of &quot;0&apos;Brian&quot; whenarrested, but his real name was &quot;0*Sullivan&quot;.    He had been on duty on the day of the crime from 8 a .m. and had beenaboutreliftvediat / 1 p.m., after which he had not been heard of.In discussing this question the view was expressed that Departments should make enquiries as to Irish door--keepers.(55) THE LORD PRIVY SEAL and THE HOME SECRETARY, return-ing from, the House of Commons after the meeting had beenin progress half an hour, reported on the general trend of Questions in the House of Commons.   At first the Househad pressed for an immediate discussion.    The Lord privy seal had pointed out the difficulties of a discussionbefore all the&apos; facts were available, and the House had accepted his proposal to have a discussion on Mondayins toad of the discussion of Irish affairs which had previously been arranged.    The Lord.Privy Seal had under-taken to put down the Irish Vote, or whatever Vote seemedmost suitable., and if the Chairman was unable to permit
the Debate to cover all the ground desired by the House,he had agreed that the Government would move the adjourn-ment.Questions had been asked as to why the. Police were notarmed, and whether they would be armed in the future.The Home Secretary had informed the Rouse that the Police.   -did hot care to he armed, but they.were permitted to beararms if they wished, and the Lord Privy Seal had undertakenthat the question :of arming the Police should be re-examined.Questions had also been asked as to whether the weaponsused for the murder of the Field Marshal had been weapons,handed Over to the Provisional Government\ to which no reply had been given.   Various suggestions had been made that warnings had been given to Scotland Yard by Members -of Parliament and- others and had not been acted on, as tothe danger to Field Marshal Sir Henry Wilson and others.-Certain particulars had been comrmmicated privately toMr Chamberlain afterwards, which are dealt with in a &apos;separate Conclusion,    The general trend of the discussionindicated that the criticism in the forthcoming debate would he directed mainly in regard to the degree of pro-tection provided in the past -and to he provided in thefuture, - -(4) Some discussion took place as to the arrangements to be made for stating the Government ease in the debate on Monday,     (All officials, .except the Secretary, withdrewduring&apos; the. discussions on this -subject.)   -Towards the endof the meeting the Lord Privy Seal received a transcriptof the Questions and Answers in the House., which he. handed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies..
\ The Conference agreed  v(a) That the Secretary of State for theColonies should be.the first speaker. fbr the -Government:(b) That he should not.confine his statement to this-particular outrage, but -should review the situation as a whole, aceentu-jating the importance of the recent voteby the Irish people in favour of -the- Treaty;. Setting forth how much the British Govern-fnent had done to enable the. Northern Govern-- ment to protect,itself;    describing the representations made to the ProvisionalGovernment, either by reading the PrimeMinisters letter to Mr Collins (seeConference of Ministers of June  2nd)  orotherwise;    and generally emphasisingthat the root of the trouble was the irish republican Army, and that now the Provision-al Government has received its vote ofConfidence, from, tho Irish people the BritishGovernment is entitled to insist that theambiguous position of-the-I.R.A. must cometo -an -end;(c) That at an early stage of his speech theSecretary of State for the Colonies should include a statement on the question of theprotection now being offered:(d) That Colonel..Childs should communicate to -the Secretary of State for the Colonies full information in, regard to the information at. &quot;Scotland Yard of threats, warnings and protection generally ( See Cone conclusion: 7 below)&apos;.GED WARN-       (5)  (The Officials of the Home Office and the police to THE - . .. v.;Force were present during this part of tho discussion..)THE LORD PRIVY SEAL stated that after Questions in, Colonel archer-SheeParliament he had asked / to cor-;o to his. roomSolohel Are her-Sheein - the&apos; House of Commons . / had given him variousinstances of warnings alleged, to have been given to Scotland. Yard as to the&apos; danger to certain persons.    In particular,it was alleged that --I.,a&apos;jor . Arbuth.not had&apos;received&quot; informa-tion and had notified. Scotland Yard that on Juno 14th alarge gang: of gunmen had come over&apos;to this&apos; country viaFishguard,- and that Colonel Sanderson had either forwardedor brought.-to Scotland Yard a typewritten warning some; three weeks., ago indicating the existence of special danger to Field Marshal Sir Henry Wilson,- Colonel Grot ton, LordFarnham and Col onfL Archo r-She e .-:cb.
1 20 9Colonel-Carter was asked to enquire at ScotlandTard TThether this information had been received.Later in the meeting COLONEL CARTER returned and stated that he had not been able to discover the type-written document referred to, although it was possibleit might still be found..  He thought it not improbable,however, that the document might have been destroyedafter being incorporated with., other similar information in the records of the Department.    This course was oftentaken for the safety of persons -who gave information.He read a document, dated March and, indicating theintention of the Irish extremists to  &quot;do for&quot; Judge Wilsonand Sir Henry Wilson.    The enquiries were still being pursued.COLONEL CHILDS was very sceptical about the informa-tion supposed to have been given by major     Arbuthnot,whom he knew intimately.    He.recalled an incident threeweeks before, when information had been received to theeffect that certain Cabinet Ministers were threatened, andhe had taken immediate steps for their protection.    Thedifficulty, however, was that no information was everreceived from Ireland as to when Irish gunmen were comingover to this country.    One statement whidh had been broughtto the attention of Scotland Yard to the effect that agreat number of Irish gunmen were coming over, had beentraced to some remarks made by an R.I.C. man who was drunkat the time.    Another difficulty, was that Scotland Yardhad very little knowledge.of what persons in Ireland were sufficiently important - to be protected when on a visit tothd3 &apos; country .The Conference were informed that some time ago the Ulster Government had been asked to furnish informationas to what Ulstermen should be protected vhen visiting thiscountry, and persons who were notified by them were in. fact
put. under protectrLonr when. Irr Oreart Brd-bairu   That- ^morninga letter had -been received by Scotland Yard from Mr LionelCurtis undertaking to give information &quot;/hen persons -from ireland of sufficient importance to be protected were to visit this country\COLONEL CHILDS - informed the Conference that sometime ago he had received from&apos; Field Marshal Sir henry wilson a number of threatening, postcards which had beensent to him.    On investigation .those had been- proved toemanate from a person of weak intellect in the suburbswho was in -the habit of sending such missives to leadingpublic men.   No subsequent notification had been receivedfrom Field Marshal Sir Henry Wilson.The Conference agreed  . as(a) That Scotland Yard should keep in^close touch as possible.&apos; with the Ulster/-Govern-ment in order to ensure that protection wasgiven to persons visiting this country fromUlster who were deemed to be.likely to be threatened:&apos;(b).That Colonel Childs should communicate thefacts in regard to such warnings.iFD (6) In connection with, the subject referred to in the)rtt TO previous Conclusion    some discussion took place as to theiff). .expediency of establishing a passport systern between Ire-land and the British Isle-s .   The view met with considerable support that some system of passports ought.,, in presentcircumstances, to be provided.The Conference were reminded, -however, of the essen-tial difference between the establishment of a passportsystem between Ireland and Great Britain and between theContinent and the United Kingdom,   In the latter case thoforeign Governments were concerned to assist as much aspossible    The Irish Government, on the other hand, wouldnot have the same interest.   To make it effective it wouldbe necessary that the passports sys ten; in Southern Ireland
2iifshould he in the hands of the military authorities.There was the further difficulty of Ulster.GENERAL HORWOOD, on the has is of great experienceduring the War, expressed his opinion  hat the passportsystem across the land frontier could net be made effec-tive.   This would therefore involve passports betweenUlster&apos;and&quot;Great Britain.   Moreover, the passport system with, the Continent had only been made effective by reduc-ing the passenger traffic- to a mere trickle.The Conference were reminded that in the present case one of the accused was a Government serrant and hadlived in London for years.   There was some evidence thatthe other man was also a Londoner.   If both were Londoners,therefore, no passport   system would have availed.SURF.S OF (7) The Conference were informed that the moasures6fTEOTION.protection initiated during the acute stages of the Irishcrisis had been brought to an end shortly after January13th.   Subject to a few-exceptions, protection had then been withdrawn from Cabinet Ministers and from certain other persons who had up to. then been protected.   In thecase of Field Marshal Sir Henry Wilson, protection hadbeen given so long as he was Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff, and a letter from the&apos; War Office to Scotland Yardwas read to the Conference thanking them for the steps taken and asking that in the case of necessity the sameprotection might be given to Lord Cavan, the new Chiefof the Imperial General Staff.At the present moment, in accordance with tha decision taken at the Conference of Ministers on the previous day,,,,protection was being given to all Cabinet Ministers, aswell as to Load. Carson and Captain Charle s &apos; Craig.j After some discussion, the Conference agreed  ^a) That;.protection should, in addition, bearranged for the following:-
The Viceroy,Colonel Archer-Shee, M.P.,Lord ParnharijColpnel Gretton, M.P,,r Mr Ronald HcNoill, M.P,That protection should he given&apos; toGeneral Sir Kevil Macready, tho GeneralOfficer Commanding in Ireland,, when on- :a visit to this country:That protection should he given to sir james: Craig and Lord Londonderry -whenever they visited this country, as well. as,,.tosuch other;persons as. might he notified bythe Government of Northern Ireland or bythe Co1&apos;oni&apos;al Office&apos;-.
-  (8)&apos;,     -Towards the end of the meeting,the Polioe. Report was received of -the resultsof. the searches.- made :of irish suspects duringthe previous evening,:; .. One. revolver had he en-found but the suspect in question had been lodgingwith his brother, who had a licence for a revolver.A .number of documents ..had,, been fotind and. werebeing examined&apos;, -but at a &apos;cursory glance they-appeared to deal mainly with propaganda and tohave.no connection with the murder.      In the house-*f one of the women.-suspects had been found anumber of incendiary tubes similar to those whichhad been discovered after an incendiary outrageat a garage a year ago.       The name of the authorof the letter road at the Conference on the pre-vious day had also been discovered.(9) The Conference discussed the questionOf speeding up the trial or at any rate, the magistrate-rs Investigation, first- with Sir ArchibaldBodkin - Birector of Public Prosecutions - and towards the end of the meeting, with the Attorney-General.SIB ARCHIBALD BODHIH stated that the prisoners- had heen f urmslly charged that &quot;moraine and.had been remanded until Saturday, July 1st.The Conference felt strongly that if possiblethe second appearance of the prisoners   beforethe magistrate should be expedited.A number of objections were raised tothis course.     The Coronerxs inquest could not take: place before Monday and a day or two-wouldhave to elapse after that;   -the Director of/Public
&quot;Public Pro-.Beourta.ons-had not yet before him a singlestatement on the case, although-there was no.doubt ao to the    evidence being available?    some of the.most import-,ant witnesses, who had been engaged in the pursuit,would be too ill to appear for some days:    certain work-men engaged on the road who had been eye-witnesses, worevery nervous about giving evidence although in thisconnection It was mentioned that tho names of witnesses   -should not be given.nor should photographs be taken ofthem;    it had been felt that it would be better to marshal and have available, all the evidence before thecase for the prosecution was opened;    It had been thought that it would he undesirable to draw special pro-minence to this case, whioh the Irish extremists woinlclwish to represent as a great political trial, by depart-ing from the usual practice which was to give a weekTsremand;    there was a precedent for the course now pro-posed in the caso of the Gurzon - Wyllie murder;    in anycase the trial could not come before the Assizes before july 18th unless special Assizes were arranged;    specialAssizes could only be arranged on a demand from fourjudges;    eight days would have to elapse after the judges had made their demand before the Grand Jurycould be summoned;    the judges might refuse, as only aweekrs advance of the Assizes would be obtained.Against this, a number of disadvantages of delaybewere pointed out.     At the first stage   the public would /greatly incensed at the outrage;    by.keeping the matter before the public, however, for some time,  the prisonersmight become in a sense, heroes with the dangeroussection of the population;    word pictures would be Crawnof the fortitude of the prisoners and with the extremiststhey might become, heroes;    the object of the extremists/would be&apos;
would &quot;be- to- represent this as a political trial, whereas it ought to be kept ia the position of an ordinary   hlood-thirsty murder;    the longer the case lasts, the greaterwould be the risk of bloodshed in Ireland;    the defenoewould almost certainly Seek to draw out the preliminaryenquiry and if it did not begin before Saturday,  July 1st,it might be prolonged for two or three days;    there wasample evidence available without Waiting for the woundedgadbsmsEsa-witnossos and. ifae latter evidence, to.      be brought up at the trial,  could be communicated to the defence betweenthe committal for trial and the actual trial,Shere was general agreement that the Government had two objects in view -(a) &quot;To bring the prisoners to trial and to convict them as soon aspossible;(b) To avoid anything which would givethe appearance of a groat politicaltrial.After   this subject     had been adjourned until the arrival of the Attorneys-General, the Conference were informedthat it would be possible to hold the magistrate^ enquiry on an earlier day, if it were expedient.     This, however,would involve a great deal of inconvenience to the principalsand witnesses in other cases, which would have to be dis-placed on the day selected.     It was suggested that arrange-meats could be made for the magistrateTs court to sit at10 a.m. instead of the usualj. hour of ll*a.m., on Saturday,and for what are called the&apos; &quot;night cases&apos;1 to be dealt within another court, and for. the court to sit later than theusual hour of 5,0 p.m, in order to ensure conviction in asinelo day;     Moreover, probably sufficient evidence couldbe produced by 5P0 or 6.0 p...work to ensure a conviction and theremaining evidence could stand over until the trial,its    &apos;nature being communicated, in the, interval to the defence.-10**. /After
After considerable discussion, the conference agreed isThat the Attorney-General should consider the matter during the day and should consult with anyone hethought fit, and should adviselater in the day as to what course should be adopted.2, Whitehall Gardens,  -3.&apos;7,/l23rd June, 1922

been ordered to supply armoured cars if asked for and if he was able to do so. These instructions had been sent by telegram, telephone and wireless telegraphy, as the possibility of interruption of communications by one or other route had to be considered.

(Lord Cavan entered at this point).

Lord Cavan reported that the fighting in Dublin was at present suspended and the latest news from General Macready was that he did not think the Provisional Government would ask for the employment of British troops. He then read a telegram which had been sent to General Macready telling him to give all support provided it was asked for by the Provisional Government. He was also authorised to lend troops to the Provisional Government if they were asked for as well as guns, ammunition, tanks and aircraft. He thought it was a great pity the Provisional Government had not asked the Imperial Troops to carry out the task for them. General Macready&apos;s plan had been carefully worked out and would probably have succeeded.

After some further short discussion it was agreed:-

That the Secretary of State for the Colonies should send the message to Mr. Cope for Mr. Michael Collins urging that the task must not be left half completed and that it was imperative to complete the part that had been undertaken.

The Secretary of State for Colonies then left to prepare his telegram and the meeting come to an end.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR reported that the despatch of ammunition was being expedited from several quarters. There was ammunition at Carrickfergus and elsewhere. General Macready also had some 5-inch Howitzers and 4-inch guns which could be used. The arrival of fresh supplies of ammunition from Great Britain could not be counted on much under 24 hours, though this did not apply to quantities that might be sent from other parts of Ireland by safe routes, if this were possible. The danger of delay was that reinforcements might arrive from other parts of Ireland for the Republican forces.

Some discussion took place as to whether, if the Provisional Government was unable to complete the operation by force of arms, the British Government should complete the task. Some stress was laid on the very serious blow which would be dealt to the Provisional Government and the Treaty if Rory O&apos;Connor and his men held out, were successful in their resistance, and came to be regarded as national heroes. One tentative suggestion was the military authorities should be ordered to capture the Four Courts unless they were convinced that the result of this would be to combine the forces of the Provisional Government with the rebels in opposition to them.

On consideration, however, it was felt that it would not be right to place on the military authorities a decision of the highest political importance. It would place them in a very difficult position and probably confuse them as to the real intentions of the Government. It was generally agreed, however, that if the Provisional Government abandoned the task, a very serious decision would have to be taken.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR then left to proceed to the War Office to discuss the expediting of ammunition, and this conversation came to an end.

The Secretary of state for Air wasalso eiasBsrened to meet the  rlsse Minis tea?, and, togetherwith the Secretary of State for War, was with Mm - for seiset-iiaa &quot;Wfere the isaetim?.   The Secret&amp;rv of state for Airhad sent for Genera! trenchard, v?ho arrived at about 10-30.
During the Meeting both Ministers and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and the Chief of the Air Staff were constantly leaving the room to receive further information which kept arriving from Dublin.

THE GENERAL SITUATION IN DUBLIN.

During the meeting a message was received from Dublin to the effect that the capture of the Four Courts could be completed within six hours of the receipt of the ammunition asked for.

The gist of the information at the time the Meeting was held was to the effect that the rebels had been bombarded out of the front part of the Four Courts and had retired to the rear, that is to say, the half of the Four Courts most distant from the Liffey. Several gaps appeared to have been made in the outer defences, but the Provisional Government&apos;s troops had not attempted to close. The attack was still held up, and fighting was of a desultory kind, confined mainly to sniping. 

The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that an officer of the Royal Artillery had, at the request of the Provisional Government, been giving their forces such as information as they required in regard to the use of the 18-pdr. guns, which the troops of the Provisional Government were manning themselves. So far these forces had not made a determined effort to storm the building, and the impression was that the Provisional Government was unwilling to lose life in so doing. He agreed with the Prime Minister that 18-pdr, guns were not of much value for this kind of fighting. Against such solid buildings heavier Ordnance was required. So far, however, the Provisional Government had not been willing to employ it, apparently because the use of such material would require the employment of the regular troops. The attack had not
been made in the way professional soldiers would undertake it; in fact, it had not been pressed home, and this compelled a certain amount of distrust. If the British troops had to undertake the task in the end, it would now be much harder, and a new plan would have to be formed.

In connection with the failure of the Provisional Government&apos;s troops to press the attack, the Conference were reminded that they had no trained and disciplined troops at all, and were inexperienced in this sort of fighting.

Information was received just before the Meeting that the Provisional Government were willing to employ British gunners and to utilise a 60-pdr. guns.

Information was also received that 4 persons had been killed and 10 wounded.

During the evening news was also received that the Liaison Officer of the forces of the Provisional Government was in conference with the Cabinet of that Government on the question of employing British troops. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff thought that if British troops were to be used, the garrisons of Belfast and Dublin ought both to be reinfored.

There was general agreement that the Provisional Government must be supported in every way, and that the operation must not be allowed to fail. The position was similar to that which had arisen in the past in several of the Dominions, including Canada and South Africa, when it had been necessary to support the Dominion Governments.

? USE ?

Some discussion took place as to the desirability of sending further supplies of 18-pdr. ammunition by aeroplane. In view, however, of the information received during the meeting that supplies of 18-pdr.ammunition were on their way from Belfast, which should suffice for immediate purposes, and these would be increased in the afternoon by the arrival of the Destroyer from Pembroke and in the evening by the arrival of the Cruiser, this course was felt to be unnecessary.

Further, it was felt that if aeroplanes were to be used at all  it would be better to employ them for dropping bombs, but only, course, If the Provisional Government of Ireland desired this course.

The Conference were informed that there were four aeroplanes at Dublin, and a Squadron at Belfast, which could arrive at Dublin within a very short period. The ordinary equipment of bombs had been sent to Dublin.

Air-Marshal Trenchard stated, however, that the machines at Dublin were only capable of dropping light bombs of 20 lbs. These would knock about the upper stories of the buildinge, but could not be counted on to penetrate. It would be better to employ heavier bombs of 380 or 500 lbs.  112-1b. bombs could be sent, and these would blow the upper floors to pieces, and perhaps blow the outer walls down. With delay-action fuses some of these might penetrate to the bottom of the buildings, although in the case of a certain number the shell, would he broken before the penetration was affected. An expert would have to be sent to Dublin for the adjustment of the delay-action fuses
