IRELAND. 1. In the course of a discussion primarily concernedDebate on with the line to be adopted in regard to Ireland by spokes-the Address .men for the Government in both Houses of Parliament in theforthcoming Debates, it Was agreed --(a) That the Secretary of State for theColonies should be authorised tocommunicate copies of the Irish bills to Sir James Craig, the Prime Ministerof Northern Ireland, and to Mr Cosgrave,the Prime Minister cf Southern Ireland.,for confidential information: &apos;(b) That the general attitude of the Govern-ment towards the Bills should be deter-mined by the consideration that theIrish Treaty had not only been givenstatutory force by Act of Parliament,but had been before the country at aGeneral Election, when no responsibleopposition to it had been raised.Consequently the Government had no alternative but to carry through thepolicy of ratification, and would do sonot only in the letter but in the spirit:(c) That Government speakers should adopta sympathetic attitude towards thosewho had suffered from events in Ireland.In regard to compensation, for which theIrish Government is responsible, theyshould be guided by the following passage from a recent speech by the Prime Minister:-&quot;I know what the financial position ofthis country is, and I know thatthese claims, ought to be met from ireland itself;    but I do say this,that in considering, these claims we will look at them with a sympatheticmind and determined to do anything to help which we reasonably can doin that dir -ction&quot;..&apos;&quot;To take note of the following legal -^pii,isonv3a?epaR8e^:for the Information of tho Cabinet:-&quot;In our opinion there is nothing inthe Constitution of the Irish FreeState as enacted by the Irish Parlia-ment^which violates the Treaty betweenGreat Britain and Ireland.    Even ifexpressions can be found in.some articles which., taken by themselves.,, might seem:,inconsistent with the Treaty., the defectis cured by Clause S -of the Irish Act,which gives to the Treaty the forceof law and invalidates any provisionof the Constitution in so far as it isrepugnant to the Treaty..(-Signed)  CAVE.DOUGLAS McGAREL HOGG-. &quot;j*lh.e Attorney-General points but that the term-   Is an abbreviation   vof,ho longer phrase used in the King&apos;-s Speech, viz.. &quot;the House of the P&amp;rllamaentis cfblichca. under tho Irish Free.
