A .ahip was,however, being sent out which carried a 12-ton crane tofacilitate the debarkation of the heavy guns.    It would henecdssary to establish a base on the Dardanelles if further largo quantities of ammunition and stores were sent out.   Brigadier-General McRardy.had left that day forConstantinople as Major-General in charge of Administration.It was not yet known what landing facilities were available at Chanak.IK    2.        LORD LEE pointed out that the Havy could not under-ITOPLE    -ARE   take the responsibility of preventing the Turks fromcrossing the Bosphorus, if the troops were \*rithdrawn from constantinople, unless counter batteries were established on European shore.   He enquired if it was proposer toestablish such batteries.MR. CHURCHILL replied that if the troops were withdrawnfrom Constantinople it was quite certain that general harington would not mount guns on the Bosphorus whichwould be quite unprotected.   If the Turks advanced along the Ismid peninsula the probable sequence of events wasthat we should first withdraw our military forces fromthe peninsula.    The Admiralty would then remove all craftfrom the Bosphorus.    The Turks would then advance along the peninsula and their artillery would come into action.We should prevent the movement of shipping in the. black sea and the Sea of Marmora.    If peace were not then,established it might he necessary for our ships in the black Sea to run the gauntlet through the Bosphorusinto the Sea of Marmora.
3,&apos;     MR. CHURCHILL stated that he was anxious as to the position at Kum Kale and enquired if the militaryauthorities had any information as to the movement of turkish troops in that region.THE CHIEF OF - THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF stated that enquiries had been made but -no reply had yet beenrece ive d from. General Harington..llFlQAHOE OFJPAIICJH of hire,4.     LORD LEE stated that it had been suggested at theCabinet that/ was neoessary to instruct the public as tothe significance of the Chanak position to secure thefreedom of the Straits,    several newspapers which hadnot been unfriendly to the policy of the Government, were now urging the abandonment of the chanak position.    Itwas clear that they did not understand the need for themilitary occupation of Chanak to ensure the freedom of navigation, of thef Straits,     hey seemed to think that naval action would be sufficient to keep the Straitsopen, -&quot;MR. CHURCHILL remarkd that there&apos;was now generalagreement that although the loss of Ghanak would notclose the Straits to ships of war, it would fatallycompromise the use of the Straits: by merchant shipping.The freedom of navigation of the Straits cannot existwith the Turks in military possession of the Asiaticshore of the Dardanelles,    He requested that the Navaland Military authorities should confer and draw up a brief communique, 400 to 500 words,&apos; explaining themilitary need for holding Ghanak.-. -I2. wtetehall Gardens-,- &apos;fi;W;l. ,.25th Leptember; -1922.
