IRELAND

(1) With reference to Cabinet 74 (21) Conclusions 1 and 2, the Conference met to consider the reply to be sent to Mr de Valere&apos;s telegram of the 19th September (C.P.3331)

The Prime Minister said that, having regard to the fact that Parliament was not sitting, he did not feel justified in summoning Ministers together for the purpose of considering a reply to Mr de Valera everytime he sent a letter or a telegram and he had therefore taken the decision arrived at Inverness (Cabinet 74) as instructions to himself. The reply which he (the Prime Minister) had sent to Mr de Valera on the 18th inst (C.P.3331) had produced for the first time quite a different tone of answer from the Sinn Fein leader and it would appear that de Valera was losing his public and dividing his followers. He (the Prime Minister) had talked very plainly to the two Sinn Fein couriers who came to Gairloch one of whom was an out and out extremist. and they had both shewed great alarm when it was suggested to them there would be no conference.

The Prime Minister, continuing, said that it was a mistake to assume, supposing a conference did take place, that it would settle the question. He therefore urged that the Government should not put itself into a false position. On de Valera&apos;s present claim it was impossible to proceed without grave danger. It was stated by some that de Valera had got himself into a tangle by inserting in his reply the unwise paragraph about a sovereign and independent state, and that he should be helped out of his position. He (the Prime Minister) was all in favour of doing this if it was merely a question of saving de Valera&apos;s face, but if the sovereign and independent state claim was a reality it was better to fight the matter out now.




The Conf erence then considered jgeveral draftreplies which had been put forward.It was urged that if it was possible to enter aconference without the risk of recognising an irish republic all would be well, and if the conference failedthe Republio would never have been recognised by us.It was to be remembered however that the publio had setthMr heart on a conference and if there was a breakwithout any meeting having taken place it would be saidthat a conference might have saved the situation.General support might not be given to the Government ifit was to break with the Sinn Peiners because they wouldnot say they accepted the Crown and membership of theEmpire, as a preliminary to a Conference.Some discussion then followed on the suggested aban-donment of the Inverness conference and the proposed meeting to be held in London on October 4th.    The PrimeMinister said this course would have the advantage of starting negotiations on a new basis.   The correspondencewhich had taken place with de Valera since the InvernessCabinet did not form a suitable basis for negotiations.Further, the suggestion of a new conference would be ofundoubted assistance to de Valera, Inasmuch as it wouldfree him from the position he had taken up during thelast fortnightsAftei* further discussion the Conference agreedprovisionally^ on the draft set out Ih Annex I.The Conference then adjourned until thefollowing mOrhlng.GairlochSeptember 21st 1921,
