ij 157With reference ?to Conference of Ministers held onthe 9th February, 1922, the SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIAredd a draft of a Telegram which he proposed to sandto the Government of IndiacTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS suggestedthat some sentences should be added to the telegramtreating the matter from the wider point of view^ that isto say, pointing out that the Government of Indiansproposals for Indianisation were not consistent with themaintenance of British asoendanoy in Indiac      If theseproposals were given effect to, our military positionin India would be permanently impaired.     The establishmentof an Indian Army officered by Indians would  . be a challenge to our rule in India; and we had no intention cf surrender-ing it.THE PRIME MINISTER^concurred.     He said that he felt the Viceroy was in a very difficult position^     It wasnecessary that they should take steps to strengthen theGovernment of India by sending out to the Viceroy three orfour first rate men to take a place cn his Council0     Hewould like a Committee formed cf Members of the Cabinetto consider that question and to make recommendations for strengthening the Government of India*     Their proposals should be sent to the ViceroyPTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA stated that he had written in that sense to the Vicerc^ two weeks agoB     Hey had suggested to him that it would probably be useless fcr himto seek for suitable men in India, and that any proposals he might make for strengthening his Council would have thesupport of His Majesty*3 governments the SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES expressed theopinion that the Viceroy/ ought to have by him four cr fivemen of the calibre of Cabinet Ministers n&amp;io would constitute an Indian Cabinet.      It would not be necessary for them tohave Indian experience.THE PRIME MINISTER/
THE PRIME MINISTER   expressed a wish that a CabinetCommittee consisting of the Secretary of State for India9the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the Secretaryof State for the   Colonies, the President of the Board ofEducation and Lord Lytton should advise as to the stepsto be taken to strengthen the   Government of India0THE PRIME MINISTER referred to the remarks madeby Sir Claud Jacob before the Indian Military requirements committee on the 10th February,,     Sir Claud&apos;s statement that he understood the policy of His Majesty:s Governmentwas ultimately to hand over India to the Indians and surrender British rule in India w.s evidently made in allsincerityc     It was necessary that that false impressionshould at once be dissipated,     A conviction that his majesty&apos;s Government intended ultimately to withdraw from India had now permeated through the whole of theBritish community in India, commercial as well as official,who viewed proposals for the Indianisation of the indian army with resignation as necessary steps in giving effectto the policy of ultimate withdrawals     It must be made clear that the Government had no intention cf   leavingIndia or of allowing British supremacy there to be challenged,A considerable measure of self-government had been grantedto india but- any further extension in that^direction must depend on whether the Indians showed that they were capableof making proper use of the constitution that had beengranted to them.. There must be a master in India,   Withouta master Indie would relapse into anarchy and chaos,     Wewere now masters In India, and we should let it be under-stood that we mean to remain so.
He thought it was desirable that a sentence should be added to the telegram to the Viceroystating with all possible emphasis that HisIvisijesty&apos;s Government had no intention of allowingBritish ascendancy in India to be challengedbIt was agreed that the Secretary of Statefor India and the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should confer as to the drafting of the telegram to the Viceroy.21 Whitehall Gardens, S.W.11th February, 1922,
