The Conference haft been called to consider replies to be sent to a telegram from&quot; General Haringtcn (lioc-222:5 dated 9th Sept.- 1922). and telegrams from the Commander-- in-Chief, Mediterranean,  (HoS.293,;&quot; 294, 295, dated 11thSeptember, 1922),.    In the&apos; course of the meeting a draftitelegram which the Secretary of State fc-r Foreign&apos;affairs proposed to send to Sir Horace Thunbold was received and read.    (Appendix&apos; X.)THE SECRETARY OF ST &apos;\TF F^R WAR pointed out that. inview of the successes of Femal it was probable that he would soon threaten Chanak with troops or make a public demand that our troops should be withdrawn.    It was the policyof the Cabinet to withdraw from Chanak and this ought tobe done before Kenal demanded it.    Such withdrawal should beto. Gallipoli.    On the other hand should the&apos; French andAllies agree to show their flag with&apos; ours at Chanakevacuation could be postponed.    If they- refused we shouldbe justified in withdrawing..In the course of the- dis cuss ion&apos; GENERAL CHETWODEinformed the Conference that in the view of the War Officeand Admiralty Kemal could not for some time bring heavy guns to Chanak but -that if later on he brought up 6&quot; guns- it would be difficult if-not impossible for destroyers,cruisers; or store ships, to pass up the straits.   Battle-ships could, but they would have to return to the opensea to refurnish.    He thought there might - &quot;still be someTurkish guns on the Chanak side,./-THE1 -PRIME MINISTER stated that In the eventuality ofa war In the future in which the Turks were on the side ofour enemies it was vital that we should retain the controlof the Straits and b^ able to cover Constantinople toplant guns on Gallipbli which could destroy Turkishbatteries on the Asiatic side.   That was the permanentpolicy to be borne in mind.    There was no; present Interrtiono  defending Chanak by land reinforcements and general harington should see before evacuating that-airy-guns in the Chanak area were dismantled.
&quot; OP .   The Conference next considered how best to giveFROM     effect to tlie policy of the Cabinet of maintaining thel TO &apos;position reached in the Paris agreement.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that the Greeks had been  forced to evacuate Anatolia and we did not propose to stand on the Ismid Peninsula.     It was. essential that weshould prevent troops being transferred by Eemalists toThrace to attack Gallipoli from the North.     In the recentcase when Constantinople was alleged to b. e threatened bythe Greeks we intervened and prevented the Greeks dealinga blow at the Turks where they were most vulnerable.      Ineffect we forced the Creeks to fight where they were at a disadvantage.     It was now our duty to refuse to allow the turk to cross into Europe and upset the arrangement con-eluded by Lord Curzon in March last in Paris.THE FIRST LORD OP THE ADMIRALTY, after explaining that, in the view of the naval Staff, the problem was mainly one of denying transport, by se.a to the EemaliBtforces, read the following proposals of the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean:-(a)   Kemallsts should be informed that,. .failingsatisfactory guarantees that they will make no attempt to land in Gallipoli,, all fl&amp;at-ing transport will be destroyed;fb)   Pending reply as precautionary measure alltransport in Dardanelles and Bosphorous to-&apos;   be stoppod from proceeding to Asiatic-Marmora ports..   .The Conference expressed a preference for the secondproposal over the first,, but considered that the action ofthe fleet should be directed to prevent the transport of theEemalists, at any. point, from Asia Minor to the Europeanside.MALTA/
The Conference were informed that tho battalion now available in Malta dould be conveyed to Constantinopio by september 17thoSOL. The Conference were informed by the SECRETARY OFSTATE FOR WAR that even if Kemal did not follow up hisvictories rapidly in Thrace we should feel his preoenoo Inthe Mosul area Send in Irak generally.     There are two to three thousand Turkish troops North and North-West of Mosultand with ihe help of tho Tribes Kemal could put us out ofMosul in a fortnight.     As the result of a recent skirmishwe had been driven from Rania by a band of Turks and Kurds.The conclusions of the Conferenoe may be summarisedas follows;-(1)       The draft telegram from the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs to Sir HbfaoeRumtfold (Appendix I) was approved and the acting Secretary wsb requested to arrange with the Foreign Office that Sir HoraceBumboId should shetf the tClegtam to AdmiralBrock as well as to General Harington.(2)       She Secretary of State for Foreign Affaireshould inform the French and Italian Governmentsof the Cabinet&quot;s policy sb set out in the afore-mentioned telegram, should invite their co-operation, but should make plain that shouldtheir co-operation not be forthcoming H.M.Government would proceed alone.(3)       The draft telegram prepared by the Secretaryof State for War l.j General Harlngton was approved.     (Appendix II)(4)       The First Lord should instruot the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, to take every actionneoessary to prevent Kemalist troops beingconveyed to the European shore.(5)       Tha Secretary of State for War should instruct the Commander-in-Chief, Constantinople, to destroyany guns in the Chanak area before evacuating.ltehall Gardens, S.W.I.September 12th. 1982*TALIOH.
To Sir. Horace^iBurnbold^ffrom,.fX*or&amp;. Curzon.We are doubtful from his telegrams whether:rTyejaexalUIarijigt^^is fully aware of policy which was approved by Cabinet onThursday.    It -was, while liquidating the situation in Anatoliato maintain the position in Europe which was taken up winter Paris in March and which can only be altered by bonferencoof Powers concerned.Thfes, as it Was not contemplated to hold Chanak in March,so it is thought undesirable to hold it how unless, which is most unlikely, the French and Italiahw were prepared to join in its defence.     H.M.Government do hot contemplate holding italono and War Office have authorised Commander-in-Chief to With-draw British forces. -On the other hand, ELM. Government,have not the slightestintention of abandoning Gallipoli position and are prepared tosend reinforcements toKaringtc$ to enable him to hold it.   Itwill of course be better that this occupation should;be allied occupation, and we are addressing the French and Italian Govern--ments in this sense.    If however they refuse we-should act alone,and British fleet would assist the operations.As regards the Ismid line H*M.Government did not think it likely that French and Italian troops would co-operate in their defence and therefore they propose to authorise Karington towithdraw British force sooner than incur defeat. -In pursuance of principle previously laid down Constantinople-should be held at all costs with assistance if necessary of fleet.It was deemed incredible that French and Italians would not ^oinin this defence.This statement of policy may be useful to you in present emergency and you should communicate it to Harington.
From V/ar OfficeTo General Harington, Oonstantinorjle.       11.9.22.See telegram Bo.374 of to-day1 s date from curzon to Humbold.As Cabinet do not intend to hold Chanak wo do not propose to reinforce there; you oan evacuate at your discretion, afterinforming Allied Generals.   Evacuation might be postponed ifFrench and Italian troops are also placed in Chanak, but we donot wish the position to arise of British troops above being inGhanak and forced to evacuate, either after some public declaration by Ii-emal calling upon them to do so, or after amilitary threat on their part-.    Before evacuation any Turkishguns left in Chanak area should be destroyed..As we do not intend to defend the Ismind Peninsula you may,at your discretion, also withdraw these troops.-J% shall endeavour to secure a declaration by the Allies thatthey will not allow ICemaMsts to- transfer troops from Asia tothe European side and the navy have instructions to preventdotransport from being used for that purpose; if our Allies/not co-operate we shall act alone in that -respect.We are not satisfied that Gallipoli shall be held .by French and italians alone;  therefore we suggest that troops at Chanakshould be evacuated to Gallipoli.Bo you require the additional battalion from Halt a in the abovecircumstances?
