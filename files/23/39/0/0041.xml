(1) TIE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR ...THE... CGLCinh^r*ead^-a,reply that had been received from the Government of-Newfoundland&quot;in which&quot;they-indlcated their , support&apos;ofthe attitude taken up by the British governments the LORD CHANCELLOR suggested that this reply should be issued to the Press and the Secretary ofState for the Colonies requested the Secretary to make thenecessary arrangements for this to be done *It was . agreed;(See Conclusion (a) j)(2) THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS read a telegram received from Lord Hardinge in Paris outlining the attitude of the French Press,    He also read aletter from Lord. Hardinge who said, that public-opinion in France v/as hardening against any. opposition to , theTurks.    It was unlikely that any French ships ortroops would be sent Unless Mustapha Kemal took overtaction against the French^(3). THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLO BIBS statedthat lie had ascertained that the Cabinet instructionsto Sir H,Rumbold were sent on Friday night (TelegramNo.393K    He had received a reply from Sir H,Rumbold thatthe notification to the Nationalists Forces would be madeto-day*    He did not know why the instructions had notbeen acted on before.THE PRIME MINISTER remarked that this was hardlyfair to Mustapha Kemal,TILE SECRETARY CF STATE FOR V.V.R pointed out thatKernel was still without any defined zone.It v/as agreed:-(See Conclusion (d) )(4) - THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs stated that he had sent a private telegram to Sir H. Rumboldpointing out that during&apos;his visit to Paris the questionof a-Peace Conference was sure to arise aiid asking Sib
H.Rumbold1 s opinion whether he should urge a PeaceConferonce on a large scale or .hether it he preferable for a ?reli]&quot;;iino.rjy Conference to be held on the lines ofthe proposed Conference, of Venice.    His own view was thatif this proposed Conference was held there was a dangerof a dead-loch due to the Kenalist putting forward extremeterms at the Preliminary Meeting.   He considered that Itwould be better- to arrange for the main Conference as soonas possible..       However; Sir H.Rumbold, did not share his views and considered that a pi^oliminary conference to beheld at the same place as the main conference would havethe following advantages(l)    Time Would be gained inorder to&apos; consolidate the position in the neutral zone;(2) a Preliminary Conference could be arranged more quicklyj(3)    Ho inclined towards the Conference being held atVenice in order to avoid the appearance of our having been compelled to change our plans owing to the Kemalistvictory.    (4)    The preliminary Conference would define thescope of the large Conference!.THE PRIME MINISTER questioned the value of a preliminary Conferences    It seemed certain that theTurks would, raise the terms of t he final peace.     In realitythere would only be one Conference..It was agreed:-(See Conclusion (e).)ICY (5)       THE LORD PRIVY SEAL referred to the Serbian MinistersIHRACEcinterview with M,Poincaro, in which M.Poincare spoke as ifthe British Fleet played no part in the world.    It appearedto- him to be of importance that the Serbian Minister had stated that once contact had been established between turkey and Serbia he did not mind how broad the boundary might be.This.would profoundly affect our policy in Thrace,/THE SECRETARY OF STATS-
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSconsidered that this was only looking at it from theSerbian point of view.    The Turks, once back in Constantinoplewould obey no law or regulations as to the size of theirArmies and   astern Thrace would become to all intents and purposes a Turkish possession-.   Bulgaria and Turkey would,then be certain to cause conflict In the Balkans.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL stated that the complete defeat of the Greeks really wiped them off.    We could not undertakewithout French help to maintain the Greeks in Ihrace.    Itwould only be possible if backed by the European Powers *&apos; THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS suggested the possibility of reverting to the idea of the formationof a League of Nations state     This might be extended andso constitute a &quot;buffer&quot;0    He pointed out that in practiceno Treaty lasts more than ten or fifteen years, and onlydeals with the situation at the moment *     He did not proposeto make a fight for the Greeks in Thrace unless support byEurope was assured.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that in his view we wereprepared not to surrender Constantinople until the turks had made a proper pea36 with us and our Allies.    If theFrench did not give us support we would not hold Constantinoplebut we wore determined to hold Gallipoli if necessary aloneaANCE       6. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR pointed out that allIED : &quot; &apos;&apos;/  .   .the telegrams from Sir H9 Rumbold and General Haringtonhad been based on the expectation of allied supports    he considered that it was essential that we should ascertainat once whether the French were actually withdrawing from/Chanak
Chanak. If the reply was in the affirmative we should withdraw from Constantinople and concentrate at Gallipoli. He had not yet consulted the C.I.G.S. but he believed we had sufficient force including the reinforcements already on their way with which to hold Gallipoli.

IMPORTANCE GALLIPOLI. (7) THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES considered that the French attitude would be that their troops would remain guarding Ismid and that the Turks would not attack them there but would concentrate against Chanak held by us alone. If the French had really withdrawn from Chanak we should reinforce our troops there by those from Constantinople, making it plain to the French that they would thus be responsible for Ismid and Constantinople while we were responsible for Gallipoli. This would place the French in the difficult position of being left to compete with the Turks at Constantinople while we were gaining complete command of Gallipoli.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was necessary for them to know General Harington&apos;s views. He was not sure that the suggested withdrawal to Gallipoli would place the French in so difficult a position as suggested. Would not the French inform Kemal that they would hold Constantinople for the Turks and keep the Greeks out? General Harington would have been deposed from his dominant position and the French would be supreme.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said that France would then have attained the pivot of her ambition. She would be in control of the centre of the Mohammedan world.

THE PRIME MINISTER agreed and considered that General Harington should first give his military appreciation of the situation. He was the best judge and would know whether the French were really retiring from Chanak.

/THE FIRST LORD
THE FIRST LORD OF THui ^ADMIRALTY hoped that vrewould not rotiro from Constantinople unl-se absolutely,necessary a    France had long been striving for the dominant position at Constantinople.    One of the reasonsadduced against our closing the Naval Dockyard atConstantinople had been that the.French would immediatelytake charge and gain importances .   .THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES statedthat all our misfortunes had arisen in the past fromtrying to do that fov which we had not got the strength,By trying to hold both places with insufficient troopsit might lead, to a military disaster which would bo stillmore disastrous for our prestiges   The Turks would always hate whatever European power was dominant atConstantinople.  .THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS pointed outthat we had just thanked the French for their telegramannouncing co-operations    Ho considered that weshould use no threats,, at any rate until our reinforcingtroops had arrived,THE LORD PRIVY SEAL thought our policy should be one of co-oporation with Franceo   We should not leaveConstantinople unless the French stated that they were going to leave.   We should make it plain that we werehot prepared to take on our own shoulders the sole defenceof Europe against the Turk- but that we wore determined tohold Gallipolio5 OF NAVY     &apos; (8)     THE PRIME MINISTER asked the First Sea Lord whether,-iEVIKT:8iS OF if our troops wore withdrawn from Ismid, the BritishPloet could prevent the passage of the Turks into Europe./THE FIRST  SEA LORD
THE FIRST SEA LORD.replied in the affirmativeprovided the Naval G0 in C. was given carte -blanchein sufficient tineo    The Kemalist troops mustcross the sea and. the British Fleet could controlall transport., including, if necessary, Bolshevist-transports c    If this was done the Fleet couldcommand absolutely the Black Sea, the BosphortcaySea of Marmora and the Straits cf Gallipoli*THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIESdrew attention to the danger which our small forces might, be placed in if the French withdrew their forces oTHE PRILIE MINISTER pointed out that general harington had full authority to withdraw our troops if he considered that they were in dangerof isolation!.Vx
IS OF,IUDE OFjDDS ofPEA9.. THE LORD PRIVY SEAL suggested that a telephonemeasage should be sent to Lord Eardinge in Paris,  in orderto confirm the reports that had appeared In the Press.  ;.It was agreed:-t see Conclusion (f).)KGEKTHAU^LOo       THE FRIIvIE MINIS PER stated that he had seen Mr.Morgeipihau that mornings.    Mr. Morgenthau considered thattho British action during the last few days was the best possible as regards the Mohammedan world-      The fact thatthe British Empire had taken a firm stand in spite of apossibility of their receiving no help from France endItaly , would have a very good effect on all Mohammedans..The effect would be infinitely better than a retreat frombefore Remal and would prevent the Turk boasting that hewas a better man than the Christian.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER pointed out that thisview was confirmed by the Article in to--dayl s &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; by Mr, Clayton.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR stated that the telegramfrom Mr, Clayton had been censored by the WarOffice owing to astatement at the end of it.JAISSANCE * 11.,ROACHESUK.THE SECRETARY OF STASH FOR THE COLONIES drew attentionto the two roads by which tho Turks oould bring up guns tov. -. - - -Chanak.     He suggested these roads should be watched. Warshipslying within range of these roads would make the Turk pausebefore attempting to send heavy guns or large columns of troopalong these roads.     It was possible that this had already beeidone, but he suggested, that the Naval C.-in-.0.. in theMediterranean should be reminded of the importance of theseroads.THE FIRST SEA LORD stated that the.Naval CR-in-C. inthe Mediterranean had already detailed HRM.Ships &quot;Stewart&quot;,&quot;Diligence&quot;/
"Diligence", and four Destroyers to watch the Panderma Coast road. He added that H.M.S. "Stewart" carried 4.7 gaus and that they could easily be reinforced in a few hours by a light cruiser or heavy ship.

12. THE FIRST LORD read a telegram received from the Naval C.-in-C. to the effect that the Captain (D) 7th Destroyer Flotilla considered the Turks were likely to land on the orders not to allow the Turks to cross to Thrace, should instructions be given to prevent the Turks leading in these islands.

 THE FIRST LORD pointed out that this telegram must have crossed the telegram despatched last night which gave the Novel C.-in-C. full authority not to allow the Turks to embark in any vessels whatsoever.

13. THE FIRST LORD then read a telegram from the Naval G.-in-C. requesting instructions as to whether a control of shipping proceeding to Asia Minor should be instituted in order to prevent the supply of wanlike stores to the Turkish Nationalists.

It was agreed:-

 (see Conclusion (j).)

14. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES read a telegram received from the Government of the Dominion of Canada pointing out that in their view public opinion would require parliamentary approval before definite assistance could be sent. They also requested that the fullest information should be sent to them pending this decision.

 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES suggested that he should prepare a draft reply for the approval of the Prime Minister pointing out that it had not been considered necessary in London to summon Parliament, and that it was hoped the necessity for this would be averted. If the


If the necessity arose immediate information would be sontto the Canadian Government.     He would give t bo. Canadian-Government full information as to the present situation andWould suggest that, they should in tho meantime issue a statement associating themselves with the- Imperial Government butnot committing themselves to any definite support.It was agreed(see Conclusion ( b) .)15.        THE SECRETARY OR STATE FOR THE COLONIES read atelegram received from the -Gove mmen t of Hew Zealand in whic)-they offered Forces for Gallipoli and in which  hey requestedinformation as to the best position for this Force^It was agreed:-: (see Conclusion (cK)16.&apos;   .   THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS read &amp;personal telegram received from Sir H. Rumbold, describing ameeting of the High Commissioners,  in. which he stated that &apos;his colleagues were very depressed.     Ftahoe appeared to boirritated by the statements that had appeared in the british press.      The Italians were gloomy and considered that theAllies Would have to deal not only with Remal and a Revolu-tion in Thrace, but that trouble with .demobilised bo Idlersmight be expeoted.     Sir Hex aee Rumbold also stated that he considered it,&quot;unwise to count on support by our Allies.   Hewas unable to say what the French High Commissioner would say to Kemal, but he considered that Prance and Italy wouldadvocate the return of Adrianeple to Turkey.-     He also oon-sidered that the British Empire if it adhered to its present attitude must be prepared to see the matter throughalone.     He suggested that tho British Government might make an announcement concerning Eastern &apos;Thrace and Adrianoplestating that this question would bo considered in a benevolenspirit.ATTITUDE/
17.       TEE SECRETARY 01&apos; STATE for FOREIGN AFFAIRS alsoread a telegram received from Sir R. Graham at Romareporting s semi-official communication that appeared in the &quot;Tribuna&quot;, which suggested that Italy would not participate in military operations should these heextended to European territory, although Italy defendedthe principle of :the &quot;liberty of the Straits&quot;.18.        THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS suggeststhat it might bo&apos;wall for him in Paris to indicate at anearly stage&apos; that&apos;on some , questions on which the National! sTurks thought we were against them, in reality we had&apos;an open mind.THE PRIME-MINISTER said that our attitude towardsConstantinople had been defined in the statement of policyissued on the previous TuesdaysTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS pointedoub that anything he said in Paris would be communicatedto Feridd     He would suggest that the question of Thracawould, have to bo discussed, and on this he was inclined to say that the views of Serbia and Roumania&apos;Would haveto be taken into account.     As regards Turkish sovereignty,over.Gallipoli,- ho would say that we did attach importanceto this, what wo insisted on was security for the freedomof the Straits-,19.       THE .SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR. read a draft telegram that he proposed should be sent to general harington, -asking for his appreciation of the situation.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES recalledGeneral&apos;Haringtonrs programme as follows:-     First of allthat We should try and,hold both Ismid and Chanak&apos;; thenif - necessary &apos; that we should withdraw from Chanak-; next,withdrawal should take place from Ismid, and., finally,that we should hold Gallipoli.    Ho said that if the Frenchwithdrew/- 10 - &apos;1
,  i . 2.81; !jwithdrew from Chanak we should reinforce.or-qe&apos;&quot;our-t&apos;.troops-at chanak by. moving units from -Ismid.     He. enquired whether we were only holding a small position in. Chanak, if so,there would not be. room to employ a larger foroo there later-on.TUB CHI SB OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF stated thatpresuming wd&apos; intended to hold both Constantinople andChanak;  at present we:wore concentrating 7 battalions andone thousand marines at Chanak, with which we would be ableto hold a front, of Eg miles in length.     This length could be held wo11 and strongly.       According to tho latest: &apos;     information that he, had, the Turkish heavy guns would be some200 to 250 miles away.     He pointed out. that tho turkish nationalist forces were  thoroughly well equipped with thelatest French equipment,  and must be considered a seriousenemy.      The Turk was a very fine soldier when it came to- the question of making, an attack.     The Turks were wellsupplied with ammunition, though -perhaps not on the scale of the Western Front,.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL stated that the telegram fromSir H. Rumbold was .ominous.     It was necessary to know whatGeneral Harington --proposed. &apos;THE PRIME MINISTER agreed that it was necessary toobtain from General Harington his. military -appreciation,but we should avoid asking him a loading question as regardsthe evacuation of Constantinople,  as this would onlyembarrass him.THE LOAD PRIVY SEEL suggested the wording&apos; &quot;bearing in- mind that our vital interest is maintenance of the command of the Straits of Gallipoli&apos;?.   -It was agreed: -(see Conclusion (h).)^I?0L1: 20.       THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES said thatfusibility   supposing we concentrated all our troops on Gallipoli with sufficient guns and the Turks held &quot;Chanak,. with tho troops. ,    &apos; and/- 11 -
 and artillery would we be in any danger of being attacked? Could we remain in possession of Gallipoli for a year or more?

 THE FIRST SEA LORD replied: "As long as you like".

 THE PRIME MINISTER said that suppose we held Gallipoli and did not hold the Bosphorus and the Turks crossed into Thrace, could we then defend Gallipoli against the Bulair lines, using the fleet to sweep the Bulair Peninsula with their guns.

 THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF stated that the Bulair front was six miles inland.

 THE FIRST SEA LORD said that guns from the fleet could fire across this front from both sides.

 THE PRIME MINISTER asked whether we could held the six mile front?

 THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF said it would require a division.

? BEATY TO ACCOMPANY LORD CURZON TO PARIS

21. THE PRIME MINISTER thought that it was of importance for a naval officer to accompany Lord Curzon to Paris. He pointed out that Marshal Foch and the French generally had no "sea sense"; The British navy was an important factor to which the French did not give sufficient value. He suggested tha the First Sea Lord should accompany Lord Curzon.

 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES agreed, and pointed out that this would give tho impression that the Navy was the weapon we intended to use.

 It was agreed:-

 (see Conclusion (m).)
