GRECO-     1.    THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR read a telegram whichIHKISHCITATION.     he had received from General Harington, reporting that hehad informed the Kemaligjbs *that the neutral zone of theStrai&amp;s must be observed.     General Harington feared that unless immediate steps were taken to strengthen our forces Kemal might act precipitately and advance on Con-stantinqple, but he was hopeful that prompt action by usmight have a deterrent effect upon him,     General Haringtonestimated that if the French were sincere in their prom-ises of support, he could hold Out in Constantinople for &apos;three or four weeks,,THE PRIME MINISTER read telegrams from the  avalCommander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean &amp;jjs0 339 and 340)referring to the naval action proposed to be taken to dealwith any attempt of the Kemalists to transfer troops tothe European side of the Straits&amp;     He read a further tele-gram from the Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean (Ho.342) forwarding a report from the Senior Officer of the3rd Light Cruiser Sq.uaa.ron, as to the resolution passed at a conference of the Allied Admirals and Consulsat Smyrna regarding the action to he taken to deal with thesituations     A further telegram from the Senior Officer ofthe Light Cruiser Squadron to the Admiralty (No. 499) onthe same subject which was also readoTHE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY drew attention to&apos;the opinion expressed by the Naval Commander-in-chief thatsurveillance would not be sufficient to deter the Kemalistsfrom attempting to cross the Straits^     We might thereforehear at any moment that &quot;he had been compelled to use force andso commit an act of war against the Kemalists,,It
It was agreed:-(See Conclusion (a)).rtsTANCE FOE   2.     LORD CUR2OH raised the ouestion as to whether it wasK REFUGEESiYRHiU possible to do more to assist the Greek refugees inSmyrna.     The situation there was deplorable.      Therewere from 100,000 to 200,000 Greeks in Smyrna who couldnot be removed, as Greek shipping- was not allowed to enter the port.     He reminded the Conference that when thequestion of the assistance of British ships was raisedbefore it was agreed that, no assistance should be givenunless the whole of the Greek shipping was made availablefor the removal of refugees.     He suggested thatthe  . oard of Trade might be asked as to whether british shipping could easily be made available in case ox need.THE PRIIIEj LTKISTBli read a telegram from Mr. Bentinckat Athens (Ho. 447) in which reference was made to themassacres at Smyrna and in which it was stated that theGreek Press was criticising adversely the inaction of theBritish warships at Smyrna.MR. CHiMBSRL^ISi reminded the Conference that at ourinstance the Italian -admiral was approaching Kemal to en-quire whether he would allow Grbek ships to enter Smyrnaand remove refugees.     If that request is not grantedwe must ask Kemal if he v. ill allow British ships to enterSmyrna with that object.     If necessary,, the xiavalOommander-in-Chief should be authorised to divert british ships to that service.THE
THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER pointed out that the requisitioning of British ships had previously been objected to on account of the expense and legal difficulties that would be created if the ships were compelled to break their contracts. He suggested that if it became necessary to charter ships, the work had better be done through the Board of trade, who could do it more cheaply and easily than the Minister at Athens, as they were accustomed to such transactions and they could easily get into touch with the managers of the leading shipping companies operating in those waters.

(THE PRIME MINISTER here gave instructions for the representatives of the Shipping Department of the Board of Trade to be summoned to discuss this question).

THE PRIME MINISTER stated that the  Americans had consented to assist the refugees and he considered that it was desirable that we should vote a certain sum for that purpose.

It was agreed:-

3. THE PRIME MINISTER stated that according to press repute Marshals Foch and Petain took an altogether  different view from President Poincare as to the situation. They shared the views of the British Government as to the necessity for action to prevent the Turks from crossing the Straits.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR informed the Conference that it would be possible to put the Experimental Brigade at Aldershot on board transports in a few days. The numbers of the brigade could be made up by transfers from other battalions without interfering with our mobilisation arrangements. The brigade would have a strength of about
General Staffabout 3,000.*   He added .-that the/attached the great-est importance to the retention of Chanak in order to en-sure the free passage of the Straits,THE 0 Ht.li&quot; OP THE TMPZEDiL GENERAL ST API? stated that according to. the reports received, the Jlemalists have a force of 52,000 rifles within -50j miles of Chanak.     To that force we could only oppose one battalione     The  emalistscould push that small force into the sea within a fort-night.      If we lost Chanak the troops in Constantinoplewould be cut off.   -  If we are driven out of Chanak, and ElsMajesty^ Government decide to re-conquer the SouthernSide of the Straits., it meant a big war and the employmentof a force of 20 divisions..     The  emailst Army was esti-mated to have a  ration strength of 250,000 to 300,000 men0THE PR MS MIEISTSF: remarked that the C,I.G.Slsestimate of the strength of the ICemalist army was far inexcess of the estimate he had seen in the reports fromGeneral Harington*     General Haringtonxs estimates had beenthat the army numbered about 70,000 bayonets and sabres,.He believed that if it was seen that we were taking immediate action to reinforce our troops on the Dardanelles, ICemalwould probably be deterred from attacking us.     He enquired asto the nature of the support that our naval forces could givethe event of an attack om Chanak by the Zemalists.THE FIRST SEA LORD explained that the naval guns werehigh velocity guns with low trajectory *     They were, there-fore unable to search out the country near Chanak by shortrange fire.-,     The ships could, now ever, take up positions on both flanks and -bring an effective fire to bear with the aid of aex&apos;ial observation-,     They could keep the coasts clear.&apos;-4w THE
, 2 ^) 7THE CHIEF OF THE BiPBRIAl GENERAL .3TAPF expressed theopinion that the Turkish guns at Chanak could not be des-troyed by such long range naval gun fireQ     To deal withthe guns mounted at Chanak, it would be necessary to mounthowitzers on the Gallipoli Peninsula.-.LORD CURZON pointed out that the force on the gallipoli peninsula was composed of Prench troops and the force at chanak.was British.     He raised the question as to what action should be taken in the event of the Prench refusing to take military action against the Turks,     If we decidedto mount howitzers on the Gallipoli Peninsula, it wasnecessary that we should make sure of having sufficienttroops to enable us to protect them*THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR v/AR pointed out that thewhole of our plans had, up to now, been based upon theassumption that the French troops would co-operate in thedefence of the Gallipoli Peninsula,,     If the Prench with-drew,  the Situation would be completely revolutionised and policy andour /plans would have to be recons Id credoTHE SECRETARY OF STASB FOR THE COLONIES urged that cheSecretary of State for bar should be givon authority atonce to make the necessary arrangements for the early des-patch of the Experimental Brigade from Aldershot.      It was desirable that the situation should be reviewed in orderthat we should be clear as to what force we could send to the Straits in a short time.     In this connection heremarked that it might be assumed that there would be nodemand for reinforcements from Iraq,      If we were pressedin that region, the British forces would be v/ithdrawnaltogether.     He suggested that a telegram should be sentto Lord Allenby asking if he could send two or three battal-ions from Egypt to the Dardanelles on condition that theywere V-a-
were replaced in a short time by two or three un-mobilised battalions from England. He considered it essential that our forces should be increased at the earliest possible moment so as to prevent their being rushed by the Kemalists. It was also desirable that heavy howitzers should be mounted on the Gallipoli Peninsula at once.

THE PRIME MINISTER concurred and expressed the opinion that the mounting of heavy howitzers on the Gallipoli Peninsula would be very important from a diplomatic point of view.  The French were afraid of our establishing a second Gibraltar on the Gallipoli Peninsula and that consideration would make them more inclined to co-operate with us.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE WAR stated that a telegram had been sent to Egypt enquiring whether a brigade of medium artillery and two cavalry regiments could be spared and a reply to that telegram was still awaited.

It was agreed :-

(See Conclusions (b) (i,)(ii,)(iii),(iv),  (v) &amp; (vi).

THE PRIME MINISTER asked the First Sea Lord for his views as to the nature of the assistance that could be given by the Admiralty.

THE FIRST SEA LORD read an appreciation of the situation prepared by the late Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean in June, 1921, the sense of which was that the Navy, could keep open, the Dardanelles in the face of any action that could be taken by the Kemalist forces. The Navy could ensure the withdrawal of the forces at Constantinople in case of need. If the risk of the passage of the Dardanelles by troopships was too great, the troops could be put on board battleships. It would also be possible to evacuate them by conveying them by sea to the Bulair Peninsula across which they could march and be reambarked
Ire-embarked oh tha ^4 ^irlraaaBeaji aJLde-*THE CHIEF OP TBS AIR STAFF repcrttui fchat, asregards Air Force re infer cements, tbe &quot;Argus&quot; Vaa*. duo toleave .England today with a flight cf seaplanes and sjirp-fighters, that is, 10 seaplanes and 6 aeroplanes, witha reserve of 150 per cent.     The &quot;Pegasus&quot; was already inthe Mediterranean,.     In anticipation of eventualitiesorders had been sent to Egypt to prepare a squadron for transfer to Constantinople.     That squadron would be readyto sail, the first part on Wednesday and the second parton Saturday, if shipping were available; and would be ableto fly in 10 days.     There was no other squadron inEgypt suitable for transfer to the Dardanelles.     The nextsquadron must therefore go from England.  . It was proposedto ask the Admiralty if the &quot;Ark Royal&quot; could be spared,appeal it would probably be found more convenient to send asquadran cf Brls*oQL fighters.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY observed that the&quot;Ark Royal&quot; would be available by Saturday, if it were decided that she should be sent.THE CHIEF OF TBE AIR STAFF said that in view of the statements that had been made as to the situation, hesuggested that a further squadron of bombers should be dea-patched.     He was of the opinion that the fighting machinescould disorganise the traffic on the roads and that the bombers would be of great assistance in stopping themovement of the heavy guns on the road and interferingalso        squadron of with their fire.     It was necessary /bo procide  fir/    singleseater fighters, as the Turks are reported to possess someFrench &quot;Spads&quot;.     He was doubtful if many of them were fit to fly, but in any case it was necessary that we should beable to destroy them at once.It was agreed :-(See Conclusions (d) &amp; (e)).(The Chief of the Imperial General Staff and Air MarshalTreuchard left at this point).-7-
ijgH SHIPPINGjHB REMOVALgjTjGSESSlOTA *4.    (Representatives of the Shipping Department of theBoard Of Trade were here called in).Mr . H .A . PayneMr. C. Hipwood andMr. A .E. Paulkner.THE PRIME! MI BISTER explained Briefly the situation.If the Kemalisfa refused permission to the Greek shipping to enter Smyrna in order to remove refugees,  it might be necessary to send Allied shipping to Smyrna fcir thatpurpose.    He enquired what steps could he taken to expedite the arrangements if that need arose.MR, FAULKNER explained that the Board of Trade could make arrangements with three leading shipping Companies,the Cunard, Ellerman and the Khedival Mail Line, subjectto a settlement at a later date.    It was probablethat there were 15 ships within 48 hours of Smyrna..The cost would be considerable, owing to the commit-ments of the ships.    The taking up of two or three ships for a week would cost several thousand pounds.    Theships were of about 3jOOO tons and could each carryabout 1,500 persons for the short voyage involved,(about 18 hours).MR. PAYNE added that before the refugees wereembarked at Smyrna, it would be necessary to ebtain an assurance from the Greek Government that the refugeeswould be allowed to land in Greek territory, either onthe mainland or on the island..THE FIRST SEA LORD stated that he would telegraph to the Commander-in-Chief to enquire what the reply ofthe Turks had been to the request of the Italian Admiralfor permission for Greek ships to enter Smyrna,, and alsoif he knew of any British ships in the vicinity that could be. made available in ca.se of need.    He would passon the information that he obtained to the Board of Trade 0MR. CHAMBERLAIN suggested that the Admiralty shouldalso be instructed to enquire whether Kemal pasha would allow British ships to enter Smyrna&apos;if Greek ships were refused admission.8THE/
THE PRIME .MINISTER was of opinion that, a telsgrant-should be sent to the Greek&quot; Tkrvernraer^assistance and informing them of what we had decidedto do in the event of Greek shipping not being allowedto enter Smyrna.It was agreed .(See Conclusions (f), (g), &amp; (h),(The First Sea Lord and the representativesof the Board of Trade left at this point )e
