February 9, 1922, the PRIME MINISTER .stated that the debate, on India in the House of Commons on the following day. was of great importance. ,   He proposed that the Secretaryof :State for India should open the discussion by a full-statement of the general position in India,   and that he himself should intervene later in order to affirm emphatic-ally the determination of the British Government to maintainBritish rule in India and to meet any challenge to oursupremacy with all the forces at our disposal:. ^THE LORD PRIVY SEAL stated that he was struck with- --the unfairness of the criticisms directed against theSecretary, of State  for India, which were mainly due toignorance..    . An /Idea was prevalent that.,, as joint authorwith Lord Che1msford of the rrcent reforms, he was an expon-ent of an anti-British . policy /In India...     -He -thought it essential that Mr. Montagu should make clear exactly what his intentions were and how far he-intended to go in Intro-.  duclng&apos;those reforms..THE -PRIME MINISTER suggested, that M&apos;r. Montagu shoujread to the Conference .the important passages.,from his speech regarding our policy in&apos; India.THE., SECRETARY OF STATE FOR itJDLA explained thedifficulties -that-had been created by the Government ofIndia/
 India owing to their handling of the Gandhi affair. He had obtained the authority of the Cabinet to authorise the Viceroy to arrest Gandhi and break up his organisation, and had telegraphed the Viceroy in that sense. The Viceroy had replied to the effect that his telegram appeared to express doubt as to his (the Viceroy&apos;s) realisation of his responsibilities in regard to Gandhi, and resenting that imputation. The Viceroy stated that he had given orders to the Governor of Bombay to arrest Gandhi and prosecute him for his last manifesto to the Government of India. That was a week ago. On Saturday last he had sent a telegram to the Viceroy expressing surprise that he had received no further information as to the arrest of Gandhi. The Viceroy replied on Sunday that the Governor of Bombay was reluctant to prosecute Gandhi on the grounds of his manifesto but preferred to prosecute him on account of the series of speeches that he had recently delivered. The Viceroy had agreed to that procedure. Another telegram had been received from the Viceroy quoting a manifesto from Gandhi, in which abominable charges were made against the Government on account of its treatment of prisoners. There was further telegram in which was stated that Gandhi undertook to abandon his campaign of civil disobedience, and was adopting a more amenable attitude. The Governor of Bombay had announced that Gandhi would be arrested to-day (Monday) on account of his speeches, but the Viceroy had requested him to postpone the arrest till to-morrow, on account of the arrival of the Price of Wales at Delhi to-day. The Viceroy had stated that he might make an announcement to that effect in the House of Commons. He wished to say in the House to-morrow that the abandonment by Gandhi of his campaign of civil disobedience did not exempt him from arrest. He proposed to say in the House that His Majesty&apos;s Government had long


 long held the view that the arrest of Gandhi was necessary. They had, however, left it to the Viceroy to decide on the date of his arrest. He considered the choice of date was an unfortunate one, as it would naturally be stated that the arrest had been made now in order to avoid a difficult situation in Parliament.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS suggested that Mr. Montagu should state in his speech that as far back as October last His Majesty&apos;s Government had explicitly authorised the Viceroy to arrest Gandhi.

THE LORD PRIVY SEAL suggested that he might say that after a careful review of the situation His Majesty&apos;s Government had told the Viceroy in advance, in a formal communication, that he would have their support if and when he arrested Gandhi.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA stated that he desired to continue his speech in the sense of the statement the Prime Minister had made to Sir Claud Jacob at the meeting of the Indian Military Requirements Committee on February 10th, namely, that it was the fixed and irrevocable decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government to maintain British rule in India, and that if there was an attempt to challenge our position in India the whole strength of British would be put forward to meet it. He would go on to say that India was not one country, that it was not certain that democratic institutions were applicable to Indian conditions, and that Indian genius must work out the system of self-government best suited to India. He also desired to give a stern and solemn warning to the Indians and to remind them that when we made the pronouncement of August, 1917, and the Governement of India Act was passed, we were proceeding upon a definite plan and that we should not be


be coerced into departing from it.     He proposed to add,that the analogy of the Irish Conference was wholly wrongand ridiculous.      India had never been promised self-government,  and the Government of. India Act and. its Pre -amble stated that further steps in the direction of self-government would be taken only when Parliament waft convincedthat the Indians had shown, by their good conducti that they knew how to make use of the Constitution that had been,granted them.      By &quot;good conduct&quot; he meant more than good conduct of Ministers and good speeches by Members&apos;.    the constituencies, too, must shbrc capacity for self-government,which included loyalty to the British Empire.     He also proposed to&apos; refer to the disrespect shown to the Prince of wales during his visit.THE PRIME -MINISTER suggested that it was notexpedient to make any statement which might be construed asan admission that His Royal Highness&apos;3 visit had been a failure,     He was inclined the other way.THE LORD CHANCELLOR suggested that reference mightbe made to the attempts by disaffected persons to mar thesuccess of the Trince! s visit.- THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA said that he proposed to continue that the Government&apos;s proclamation had promised gw0ra3   dthin the Empire, and that tendencies of aseparatist character and insults to other parts of the Empirewould inevitably result in the postponement of further steps,.Ho also proposed to say that loyalty to the King-Emperor wasa vital condition of further progress.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL deprecated the introduction of.a reference to Ireland,      There was no doubt that the casesof Ireland and India were entirely different, but he con-sidered that it would be dangerous to develop that Idea inview/.
view of the forthcoming Debate on Friday next.This view was generally concurred in.. THE SECRETARY  OF STATE FOR INDIA pointed out thatgreat difficulty was caused by the attitude of the LabourParty in regard to India.,      They were completely ignorantof India and lost no opportunity of expressing sympathy withthe most outrageous demands of the extremists, and so caused a false impression as to opinion in this country.At the request of the Prime Minister, Mr. Montaguread an extract from his speech declaring the policy of his majesty&apos;s Government.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that Mr, Montagu shouldlay emphasis on the fact that any measure of ,self-governmentgranted to India must be under the supreme and unalterable&apos;authority of the King-Emperor*The Conferenoe generally approved cfMr. M on t a gu 5 s&apos; s .t a t e m en t o f th e gen e r a policy of His Majesty!s Government inIndla .THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA informed the Confer-ence, with, reference to a decision of the Conference held onFebruary 9, 1922, that he and the secretary of State forForeign Affairs had agreed upon the draft of a telegram, tobe despatched to the Viceroy..iENT (3)    THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA stated that thereMANSOffiN        was another point in his speech which might give rise toTTJQcontroversy,     He felt that he was bound to give the Houseof Commons a full statement of all tho &quot;caxises of Indianunrest. -  There was,no doubt that one cause of dissatisfactionwas uncertainty as to the treatment of Indians in the crown colonies,     He asked for authority to say, in tentativelanguage, that that question was now under consideration bythe Cabinet.THE SECRETARY/- -p- Y,
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES stated thatif anything was said that in any way modified the announce-ment he had made in regard to British East Africa, he must ask for.leave to intervene.      The demands of Indiana asregards  their treatment in East Africa were unreasonable)and if they were conceded they would, throw the whole ofBritish East Africa into confusion.     We had no force thereto coerce the white population, who felt strongly on thisquestion^ and any repudiation of the&apos;statement he had made   .might lead to them ejecting the Indians from&apos; East &quot;Africa..The Indian population of East Africa mainly consisted&apos;oflabourers-, about 20,000 in number., who had been brought to east Africa for the construction of the Uganda Railway,They had been offered, and had -declined.,  special represent--atidn In the Council-.   &quot;They claimed that they must be treated.as ordinary voters.     This, was quite Impossible in Africa,,If &quot;hot carefully handled the question might lead-to a rebelliIt was a formidable issue-, and he thought it would be wiser to leave &quot;It alone-.     If this matter was referred to,-he; ..suggested &quot;that Mr,. Montagu1s statement should not be limited.to the -Crown Colonies, which were not mentioned, at the ...Imperial Meetings last year.     He suggested the - expression-&quot;other parts of &quot;the Empire&quot;.;might be used,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA replied that :it;was-impossible to &quot;refer * to the Dominions., as he had agreed.   that the-Indian claims&apos;for equal treatment in the Dominionscould&apos;not be granted-.     All &quot;that he desired-to be&apos;allowed toSay was&quot;that a -Cabinet decision,on this-question was awaited.It was aj-reed--^- \    ..-The the Soc ret a ry of St n t e . f o r.
