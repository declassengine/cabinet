ARABIA. 1.     mhe Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsHostilities reported that the conflict between Ibn Saud and thebetween TbnSaud and the Imam of the Yemen was of some importance as affectingImam of the .Yemen. our relations with Italy.   Up to now Italy had tackedItalian the Imam of the Yemen, who was at present gettingAttitude.the worst in the war.   ^he Italians were reported(Previous to be landing troops at various ports.     From HodeidaReference:Cabinet 62 they had. been withdrawn, and it had been occupied(38), Con-elusion 4.) by Ibn Saudrs troops.   How they were reported toprg  /^ s^W-have landed forces at Mocha, where there was said to-be an Italian hospital.    Our own attitude had been strictly neutral between the two parties.   A suggestion had now been made from Rome for Anglo-Italianmedoation.    On the whole, he inclined to the conclu-sion that he should send a polite reply that we didnot think the moment had come for mediation.   he recalled that the Anglo-Italian relations in theRed Sea had been defined at the Rome Conference, theReport of which Included an undertaking not to intervene in the event of a conflict between thevarious Rulers ,The Secretary of State for the Colonies supported the view of the Foreign Secretary.   Any intervention was bound, to be ineffective at- this moment, and. theItalians would probably interpret intervention as meaning the landing of troops .    If Ibn Saud should,capture Sanaa and. get possession of the Yemen weshould have to tell him that he must carry on the satisfactory Treaty we had just concluded with the imam,The Secretary of State for India said theIm Government of India also took the same view.The Prime Minister recalled the case of Q,atar,which had lately been under consideration.    Althoughthat was in the Persian Gulf, it was a matter in which&apos;
we were dealing with Thn Sand, and ought not to be lost sight of.   He also drew attention to telegram no-. 145-to Rome, dated. May 8th, reporting inter aliathat H..-M.S, PENZANCE had been withdrawn from Hodeidaand that the party of signallers landed from the ship had been re-embarked.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat the Italians also had withdrawn from Hodeida.The Cabinet agreed  To accept the view of the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs thathe should inform the Italian Govern-ment politely that he did not think the moment had yet come for mediationin the hostilities between ibn  Saudand the Imam of the Yemen.
REDUCTION ANDfciM.ITA&quot;ION OPAiMAMENTS .P  -The Questionof Security.I Previous. Reference:Cabinet 12I(54), 0 on-1 c lus i on 1.)2. In pursuance of their decision at the meeting referred to in the margin, the Cabinet had beforethem a Report by the Ministerial Committee on Disarm-ament (C,P.-132 (34)) on the question of security and. the attitude to be adopted by the representativesof His MajestyTs Government at the forthcoming meetingof the General Commission of the Disarmament Conferenceat Geneva on May 29th.The Chancellor of the Exchequer asked for the omission of a few words on page 2, lines 7 and. 8,of the Report, which was agreed to (See Conclusion II)below.)Some discussion took place on the subject of thealternative proposal in paragraph 5 for an undertaking by European States not to drop bombs on each other&apos;sterritory in Europe and for sanctions against any power violating the Convention.The Secretary of State for Air reserved his position on the merits of this proposal, while calling attentionto an apparent leakage of the proposal in the Press(See foilowing Minute).The Prime Minister recalled that the Lord Presidentof the Council had stated in Parliament, on behalf ofthe Government, that if the Disarmament Conferencebroke down we should aim at an Air Convention.    that proposal would have to be followed up if the Disarma-ment Conference broke down at the forthcoming meetings.The Cabinet were reminded, however, that, as statedin paragraph 5 of the Report, this proposal, like theChancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s proposal, referred, to inparagraph 3, required further investigation.On the&apos; suggestion of the President of the Hoard ofEducation a modification to Conclusion (2) was agreedto (See below) .
The Cabinet agreed  I.   To approve the recommendations contained in the Report of the ministerial Committee on Disarm-ament (C.P.-13S (34)), modified to read as follows:-(l) That the United Kingdom delegates at the forthcoming meeting of theGeneral Commission of the Disarm-ament Conference at Geneva should work on the following lines:-(a) They should recall our own efforts in the cause    of disarmament,emphasising the importance ofthe British Draft convention and the British Memorandum ofJanuary 89th.(We are not in a position atpresent to offer any furtherconstructive proposals whichthe United Kingdom Delegationcould put forward at Geneva.)(b) If the French Delegation takethe line that, owing to theattitude of Germany, the British draft Convention, with itsproposed amendments, cannotform the basis of a DisarmamentAgreement, and suggest Insteada discussion on Security ingeneral, this country should agree to take part, though the delegates might call attentionto the difficulties that havebeen met with in the past.    Theyshould also.take such action asmay be appropriate to encourage the French Delegation to takethe lead:(c) They should also make clear, in whatever manner may be most convenient, that Germany must bedrawn into such discussions ifany fruitful results are to beobtained.   Consequently, if a discussion on Security shouldbe. proposed, it should, not takeplace at the Disarmament Confer-ence, but outside, the Conference.(S) If it is found that France attachesimportance to our reaffirmation ofour obligations under the Treaty of locarno, a suitable opportunity mightbe sought, whether at Geneva or else-where, to make a statement to this effect, adding that we are unable toenter into any further commitments of that character.   The possibility should be borne in mind of obtaining,in return for such a declaration, aquid.pro quo from France in the form
of the admission of Germanrepresentatives to any dis-c-us s ions on Security .II. On page 2, lines 7 and 8, of the Report,to omit the words  &quot;by one or possiblymore groups&quot;.(NOTE:    A revised edition of theReport, incorporatingthese alterations, willbe issued.)
LEAKAGE OPINFORMAmTON.(previous reference:Cabinet 14(34), Con-clusion 1.)3.    In the course of the discussion referred toin the preceding Conclusion., attention was drawn towhat appeared to be a leakage from paragraph 5 ofC.P.-132 (34)  in the leading article in the ,,rnim.es&quot;of the same date.    It was recalled that this was by no means the first instance of leakage of disarmamentproposals affecting air forces and bomb in,??.   TheCabinet were informed, however, that the suggestionreferred to in paragraph 5 had occurred to a good many people and was being discussed privately among members of the Fou.se of Commons and. in various circlesAttention was also called to a statement in the&quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; of Monday, May 7th, purporting togive the position in the Cabinet&apos;on the subject of disarmament.    Though the report was not accurate, thearticle was more or less well-informed.    It had teenfollowed by similar statements in other newspaperson the next day.Attention was also drawn to the fact that the newspapers had formed the habit of reporting the dates of, and attendance of Ministers at, meetingsof the. Ministerial Committee on Disarmament.   Thiswas a breach of all custom, as the only officialcommuniques were those of the Cabinet Meetings.The Prime Minister undertook to ens tire that no information as to Cabinet Committees was issued fromNo. 10, Downing Street.The Cabinet agreed.  -That, except by decision of theCommittee itself, no communicationsshould be made to the Press fromany official quarter before or aftermeetings of Cabinet Committees,
imperial defence policy .Report- ofthe DefenceRequirementsCommittee .(previous reference reference e:Cabinet 18(34), Con-clusions 2,3 and 4.)(314,   The Cabinet were informed that the ministerial committee on Disarmament was making good progress with their examination of the Report of the defence requirements Committee.The subject was continued on theAgenda Paper.
KENYA,Land commissioners-,ion ReportFinance.(previous reference:Cabinet 19(34), Gon-clusions 3and 4,)5. The Cabinet had before them the following documents on the subject of the Kenya Land Coramis-s i on Report:-A Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies  (CP.-Ill (34)),covering the Report, which had beenapproved, at the Meeting referred toin the margin, with the exception ofthe question of finance raised inParagraph 28:A Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies (CP.-125 (34))adducing arguments in support of the kenya Land Commission^ view that the kenya claim for the payment of theunclaimed balances  of pay due tonative porters of the Military LabourCorps in the Fast African Campaignshould, be granted:A Joint Memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the Secretary ofState for War (0 .P.-128 (34)) givingtheir reasons for opposing stronglyany such payment, which could not be confined, to Kenya,   mhey consideredthat the Land Commission had nomandate to refer to the question atall, and had pronounced, judgment ona problem outside their terms ofreference after taking evidence fromonly one of the parties to the caseat issue,    ^hey  suggested, that if theCabinet considered that some ex gratiapayment should be made, Kenya and theother territories concerned, should find, the amounts agreed upon, and weshould set them off against their war debts and treat them as instalmentstowards their payment.After the Cabinet had heard, statements by theSecretary of State for the Colonies, the Chancelloro:the Fxcheouer and, the Secretary of State for War,a discussion took place.    mhe Prime Minister summed up the general feeling of the Cabinet as in favour oidoing something for the Kenya claim,   They had no desire to cast reflections on anyone in the past.They wished to make the natives of Kenya feel thatthe United Kingdom was a country in the justice ofwhich they could have the fullest confidence, and.thus to close the whole chapter.
The Lord President of the Cotmcil supported thePrime minister&apos;s view,    Tn his opinion the arguments of the Treasury and the War Office were unassailable.He also thought we could not go back on the attitudeof past Colonial Secretaries,    The Chancellor of theExchequer had said that he might have considered someex gratia&quot; payment but for the forthcoming publicationof the Report.   He suggested that perhaps, in view ofthe sentiments of his colleagues, the Chancellor wouldbe willing to make an ex gratia payment, in which case it would be necessary to discuss to whom it was to bemade .The Chancellor of the Exchequer consented to make an ex gratii: payment and to discuss the details withthe Secretary of State for the Colonies and theSecretary of State for War,   He must insist, however,that there should be no accusations against theGovernment&apos;s predecessors, and he would like to repudiate the charge of callous indifference.   He wouldrecapitulate the history of the question, giving thereasons for inaction in the    past, and adding that theGovernment realised that there was a very definitegrievance on this subject in Kenya and that for thisreason the Government had decided to make an ex gratitpayment,The Secretary of State for the Colonies thanked, theChancellor of the Exchequer for his statement, and.asked (i) that the ex gratia payment should take theform of a fixed sum, and (ii) that nothing should besaid in the published statement about deserters fromthe native Labour Corps.   &quot;&quot;his was agreed to.Considerable discussion took place as to the arrange-ments for the annou.ncem.ent. There was general agreement that a few days were required to enable the details of-8-
this arrangement to he worked out.   There was alsogeneral agreement that the publication in London ofthe Report of the Kenya Land Commission should be postponed until Monday next, May 14th, but theSecretary of State for the Colonies was unable tomake a further postponement of publication in Kenya.At the end of the Meeting the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies made a suggestion that instead ofhis making an announcement in the House of commons on Monday next, May 14th, as had earlier beenarranged, he should issue a White Paper announcingall the Governments decisions on the Report, includingthe financial question in paragraph 28.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That an ex gratia payment should bemade in respect of the Kenya claim for the payment of the unclaimed,balances of pay due to native portersof the Military Labour Corps in theEast African Campaign:(b) That in any announcement it shouldbe made clear that this involves no reflection on previous governments or those which had been concerned inthe question in the past.    Since,however, the Government are aware that a very definite grievance existson the subject among the natives of kenya,  they have decided, to make an ex gratia payment:(c) That the details both of the payment and of the announcement should bearranged between the Secretary ofState for the Colonies, the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the Secretary ofState for War:(d) That the publication of the Kenya land commission Report should be postponed,until Monday, May 14th, in London, butnot in Kenya:(e) That the whole of the Government&apos;decisions on the Report of the KenyaLand Commission, including those relating to paragraph 28,&quot;should bej issued in the form of a White Paper,published simultaneously with theExport.
0 1zj the INTER- 6.. The Cabinet, had before them a Memorandum byTCiWloNAL WHEAT ,;AGREEMENT . the President of the Board of Trade (CP.-126 (34))Proposals for       relating to a difficult situation arising under theLondon Wheat Agreement of last August, by which thechief exporting countries had agreed to limit theirmks t ab 1 ishme ntof Minimum London Wheat Agreement of last August, by which the; Prices -ty\$k)b, exports during the two crop years 1933-34 and 1934-35,on certain assumptions as to the magnitude of theworld demand.    From various causes those assumptionshad been falsified by events, and so far as could beseen at present the surplus stocks in Canada and theUnited States of America, which the Agreement was designed to liquidate, would, if nothing further were done, be actually larger at the end of the period than at the beginning.   The price of wheat, which, itwas also the object of the London Agreement to raise,had, on tbe whole, been sagging ever since the agreement was signed.    In these circumstances the international wheat Advisory Committee, which was set up to watch the operation of the Agreement, had worked, out a schemefor stabilising and, if possible, raising pricespending a more effective control of production, andhad asked the signatory Governments to say definitelywhether they were prepared to accept it or not.   Thisscheme appeared to be supported by the majority of thesixteen countries represented on the Committee, butit presented peculiar difficulties for the UnitedKingdom, and. the President of the Board of Trade hadserious doubts of its practical, workability.    Inparticular, he felt that it was far from certain thatthe producing countries would be able and willing totake the necessary steps to control internal prices,and. that the intentions of the exporting countries withregard to reduction of acreage must be much more clearly and. definitely stated.    It might be that some arrangement between the exporting countries as to prices-10-
was the only means at the moment which would save the Agreement, and refusal by the United Kingdom tocountenance such an arrangement would undoubtedly beregarded as a very serious matter.   The Presidentof the Board of Trade summed up the question a tissue as follows:-   Whether we should -(a) inform the other countries parties tothe Wheat Agreement that we are ore-pared to accept a scheme for minImumexport prices if all the other countriesregard it as the only remedy for theexisting, situation,or(b) state that, having regard, to our special interests as importers and traders, we cannot become partiesto a scheme which is in our viewunworkable and open to serious economic objection.After hearing a statement by the Presidentof the Board of Trade, the Cabinet agreed -That for the present our attitude shouldbe to hold our hand;    to express no views;to leave Canada, Australia and the ArgentineRepublic to arrange matters together;    and generally to adopt an attitude of benevolentneutrality.-11-
THE GOALINDUSTRY. .Organise.-tion of.Coal Royal-ties .(previous reference:Cabinet 5(34), Con-clusion 11.7. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe President of the Board of Trade (CP.-189 (34))covering an Interim Report by the Inter-DepartmentalCommittee on the Organisation of the Coal MiningIndustry, which invited the Cabinet to decide -(i) to adopt the policy of unification ofroyalties as a -useful progressive step which should increase efficiency in theindustry and facilitate gradual concen-tration;    and(ii) to utilise the Coal Mines ReorganisationCommission, (whose duties are to &quot;further the reorganisation of the coal miningindustry&quot;) as the body to which shouldbe entrusted the administration of theroyalties when acquired.This was the method favoured by the Committee to dealwith the difficulties which had arisen in the working out of the policy laid down in Part II of the CoalMines Act, 1980, and the President of the Board ofTrade hoped that his colleagues would approve inprinciple and authorise him to tell the Committee toproceed with the question of method, in consultationwith the Departments concerned.   He thought it shouldbe possible to frame a scheme of purchase that wouldbe self-supporting, involving no charge upon theExchequer .After a statement by the President of the Board ofTrade, followed, by a discussion, the Cabinet agreed -(a) While taking no decision on anyquestion, of principle raised, in cp.-129 (34), to request thePresident of the Board of Tradeto refer the question back to theInter-Departmental Committee on theOrganisation of the Coal MiningIndustry and. invite them to work out their proposals in detail, includingthe question of how the transfer fromthe old position to the one proposed would be effected:(b) That a representative of the treasury should be added to the Committee.
m p, tithe Bill.       8, The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries (CP,-124iPrevious&apos; Reference:        (.34)..).., furnished in accordance with their request-Cabinet 19(34), Con-       at the previous Meeting, on the position relative tothe Tithe Bill, now awaiting discussion in Committeeelusion 8.)5/(31*)6- in the House of Lords, which he summarised at theend of his .Memorandum as follows:&quot;The demand for a general enquiry into tithe rentcharge has so intensifiedsince the introduction of the Tithe bill that, in my view, it will prove to be extremely difficult to resist, whetherthe Bill is proceeded with or not.Opposition to the Tithe Bill inParliament is likely to be considerably reduced by the announcement of an enquiry.The withdrawal of the Bill, whetheraccompanied by an announcement of an enquiry or not, would lead to inte.intensification.fi-catipn and spread of the agitation.I strongly recommend that theGovernment, should, on Committee stage of the Bill in the House of Lords,announce its decision to set up an.enquiry with wide terms of reference,and proceed with the Bill.&quot; .The Parliamentary Secretary of the Ministryof Agriculture and Fisheries reported that he had beenin touch with representatives of Queen Anne&apos;s Bountyand other representative tithe owners who took theview that it would be inadvisable to withdraw theBill as this would give too much encouragement to itscritics.The subject with which the Cabinet wasprincipally concerned was as to whether the Bill shouldhave a time limit, and, if so, what that time limit should be.The Parliamentary Secretary of the Ministry ofAgriculture and Fisheries said that he and his department were opposed to a time limit which would givethe impression that the enquiry was going to drag on fora long time.      If a time limit were inserted there was-13-
a risk that on tne expiry of the Bill the Governmentwould he in the same position as to-day.      It had tohe remembered that the enquiry would be on a much wider issue than what was included in the Bill andwould have to include such matters as the principleof stabilisation and the working out of the schemefor the permanent redemption of tithe.     He preferreda plan that had been mentioned by the Prime Minister,namely, that it should be made clear that theprinciples of the Bill would be subject to reconsider a-tion when the Commission had reported and would bedealt with by means of fresh legislation if necessary.He had been in conference with the parliamentary secretary to the Treasury and they were agreed thatwhile the granting of an enquiry would not meet allthe requirements of the opposition, the concession would probably be sufficient to enable the Bill to be passed through the House of Lords and the House ofCommons.      The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury,however, had made a reservation that when the Billcame before the House of Commons the question of atime limit might have to be reconsidered.The First Commissioner of Works pointed outthe difficulty of fixing the amount of the time limit.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said the proposal was one to change the law and then to submit to an enquiry the very question for whichthe law had provided.      It would be represented as acase of verdict first and evidence after.The First Commissioner of Works pointed outthat that would be correct if the enquiry were limitedto the contents of the Bill, but in fact it would bemuch wider.The Postmaster-General thought that the oppositioncould only be mitigated by providing for a time limit of say two years and making it clear that it was a-14-
q atemporary solution for that period only.The Secretary of State for War thoughtit would &quot;be possible to make a good case for the Billwithout a time limit.      The Government spokesmancould point out that the Government had come to theconclusion that it would be right to investigate the whole question of tithe.      That, however, must take some time.      In the meantime, a number of hardcases would remain untouched, so, without prejudice to the report of the Commission, the Government had thought it right to give some relief in those hardcases.      In the meanwhile, experience was showing that the present law could not be worked.      Theywere proposing, therefore,  for the time being, toestablish a fair method for collecting tithe.These were temporary measures and without prejudice to the Report of the Royal Commission.The President of the Board of Education wasfrankly apprehensive about this Bill.      No doubt itwas very desirable to tidy up the law in this matter.He could not look back, however, without apprehensionto the resistance of 1903-4 when people had gone to prison rather than pay education rates.  He thought the troubles had been under-estimated.      His anxietieswere not soothed either by proposals for a time limitor the terms of reference of the Commission.      Ifthe Cabinet had known the true state of public feeling in the matter they would not have introduced this bill which, as he saw it, was a compromise, clause 1being for the benefit of the. tithe payer and clause 2for the benefit of the tithe owner.       He suggested for consideration the possibility of not proceedingeither with the Bill or the enquiry.      The Governmentcould announce that they had hoped the Bill would provean acceptable compromise but that it was no good-15- &apos;
proceeding with it unless there was some basisof agreement which at present did not exist.That might compel the interests that had something to gain from the Bill to become more active in its support.The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministryof Agriculture and Fisheries said that this coursehad been considered both in the Ministry and in conversations with representative tithe owners.All were agreed, however, that the Government wouldbe driven into holding an enquiry.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he wasnot closely acquainted with this subject.      Therewas apparently trouble in either course and theGovernment were liable to lose respect by droppingthe Bill.      He was inclined to proceed withthe Bill and hold an enquiry,  but he agreed with thePostmaster-General as to the desirability of including a time limit,  the length of which couldawait the return of the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries.        His experience showed that everyCommission that encountered difficulties was inclined to find a solution at the cost of the tax-payer.      Consequently,  if the Cabinet agreed hewould like to be consulted both as to the membership and terms of reference of the Commission.The Secretary of State for War said he was prepared to postpone discussion of the Tithe Billin the House of Lords until after Whitsuntide.The Cabinet agreed -To take no decision in the absence ofthe Minister of Agriculture andFisheries.
