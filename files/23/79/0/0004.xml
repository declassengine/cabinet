elusion 5.)June 4th,   He asked his colleagues to take note of^.v. this date.The Cabinet were informed that the Secretary   ofState for Dominion Affairs, who was unable to be present at the Cabinet, wished to give an OfficialDinner on the same date to the High Commissioners ofthe Dominions, and. had expressed, the hope that some members of the Cabinet would be able to attend thatDinner.It was recalled that in former days, before the regime of severe economy, most of the Secretaries ofState and some other Ministers had been in the habit of giving Official Dinners, and it was suggested thatif a Dinner were given by the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs other Ministers could hardly avoidreviving the precedent.A. suggestion was made that the Dinner to theDominions High Commissioners might be given on EmpireDay, but the Cabinet were reminded that there was already another annual fixture on that date which wasnormally attended by the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs and the High 0ommissioners .The Prime Minister thought it was important to watch the precedents.    If every Minister were to start an Official Dinner at the expense of theGovernment Hospitality Fund the numbers would be veryconsiderable.   He recalled that in former days therehad also been a Government Reception held at theForeign Office, to which the Dinner had been, as itwere, a prelude,THE KING.&apos;S 1.   ?he Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,BIRTHDAY._ in accordance with the precedent of recent years,GovernmentDinners. asked his colleagues to agree, subject to the KingVsapproval, that the usual Official Dinner should be(PreviovisReference: given at the Foreign Office to the Diplomatic CorpsCabinet 31(33), Con-        on the occasion of the Fing*s Birthday on Monday,
Another suggestion was that the Secretaries ofState for Dominion Affairs, Colonies and India shouldcombine in. a Dinner, but the Secretary of State forIndia demurred to this as the issue of invitations,so far as India was concerned, would involve complies-tions, and both he and his staff at the present time were already over-loaded.A further suggestion was that the High commissioners of the Dominions and of India should be invited, to theForeign Office Dinner:    but this, it was pointed out,would have an implication that might be undesirable.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should be authorisedto make arrangements, subject to theKingTs approval, for a Dinner at theForeign Office to the Diplomatic Corpson the Kingfs Birthday, Monday, June4th, and members of the Cabinet were asked to take note o1&quot;&apos; this date:(b) That the question of any other government Dinners should beconsidered by the following Ministers:-&apos;The Prime Minister,The Secretary of State forForeign Affairs,The Secretary of State forDominion Affairs,The First Commissioner of Works.
S32.   The Prime Minister reported that the questionof Disarmament was being proceeded with by the ministerial Committee on Disarmament, and he hopedthat they would be able to report a definiterecommendation at the next weekly Meeting   of theCabinet,At a later stage of the Meeting the Prime minister pointed out that there were two most urgent questions to be declded:-(i) What was to be done about the Reportof the Defence Requirements Committee?(ii) What line was to be taken at Geneva onthe re-assembly of the General Commissionof the Disarmament Conference on May28th ?The latter question would   be dealt %vith at thenext Meeting of the Cabinet, to which he had justreferred, but meastires ought to be taken to proceedmore rapidly with the Report of the Defence Require-ments Committee.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Report of the defence requirements Committee should bereferred to the Ministerial Com-mittee on Disarmament:(b) That during the absence of thePrime Minister and the lord president of the Council, theFirst Commissioner of Works shouldbe added to the Ministerial Com-mittee:(c) That the Committee should meeton the following dates:-Thursday, May 3rd, at 11 sum.Friday,     May 4th, at 11 a.m.
KENYA, 5, The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by,and Commission the Secretary of State for the Colonies (CP,-111 (54))Report.covering the Report of the Kenya Land Commission, onPreviotis which he must make an early pronouncement.   He had reference:Cabinet 38 discussed the Report with the Governor of Kenya, and(33), Con-clusion 9.) they were both in general agreement with all therecommendations   which the Secretary of Statep. (jk)&amp; summarised in his Memorandum   with the exceptionof a suggestion, made under a misconception of thefunctions of the Privy Council, that the present LandTrust Board in Kenya should be abolished and superseded a Board, appointed by Order in Council, to sit inLondon.    He was convinced that this proposal wasunsound in principle and unworkable in practice, andthat the ultimate authority must be the Secretary ofState, responsible to Parliament.   He thought, however,that the Board, as at present constituted, was over-weighted, with Government representatives and membersof the Legislative Council, and he had suggested tothe Governor the constitution of a new Board.   TheGovernor had asked for further time to consider thissuggestion, and unless the Secretary of State obtainedhis concurrence before making a pronouncement on theReport he proposed to announce that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment do not accept the proposal to establish aBoard in London, for the reasons given in his Memoran-dum, and that the constitution of the Board in Kenyais under consideration.After hearing from the Secretary of state for theColonies a statement amplifying the information in cp.-Ill (34), and. after discussing with him a numberof points of major detail, the Cabinet agreed -(a) To reserve for the moment the questionof finance raised in Paragraph 28 of cp.-Ill (34).    (See Note below.)(b) Subject to (a), to approve all theremaining recommendations in CP.-111(34) .
For the cabinet provisional conclusions on the questions offinance and of publication and procedure generally, see conclusion 4.)
KENYA&apos;-; 4. The Chancellor of the Exchequer took exceptioniand Commission to the publication of paragraphs 2048-2068 of theteport.  Report of the Kenya Land Commission, on the groundfinance,blication that it was a purely ex parte statement on a question2d procedure of long controversy between the Colonial Office, on previous the one hand, and the Treasury and War Office on reference:Cabinet 19 the other, namely, the retention of money claimed(34), Con-clusion 3.) to be owing to dead native porters killed in the War.-JCitei*)b&apos; This matter, he pointed out, lay outside the Terms ofReference to the Kenya Land Commission, who had not taken any evidence from the Departments in Londonwhich took the other view of the controversy.  .He&apos;drew attention in particular to the following quota-tion from the Report contained in Paragraph 28 of cp.-Ill (34) :-&quot;We consider that if such treatment(i,e., the retention of the moneyowing to dead porters killed in theWar) were meted out, it would constitute a much more callous viola-tion of the principles of trusteeshipto the natives than any of the injurieswhich the natives have suffered bythe alienation of their land.&quot;There was no justification, he suggested, for this -attack on British Governments of recent years .   Hesuggested that the Secretary of State for theColonies should try and persuade the Commission tomodify or withdraw such passages.   Without suchalterations publication would prejtidice the decisionto be taken on the controversy to which he had referred.The Secretary of State for War supported theChancellor of the Exchequer.    Although Kenya was onlyconcerned to the extent of  50,000 in this claim.; thetotal amount when Tanganyika and Uganda were considered^ was  150,000.    He recalled that the claim had first been made in 1921, and then again in 1925.   TheSecretary of State concerned at that time (Mr Amery),
though by no means lacking in pertinacity, hadeventually decided, not to pursue the claim.    In 1928the question had been reopened and the claim had been rejected by the Cabinet. In 1931 the question hadonce more been raised and was referred to theParliamentary Under-Secretaries of the Treasury,Colonial Office and War Office, but the ColonialOffice had again decided not to press the matter.Now, in 1934, without taking any account of theprevious history of this question, the Kenya land commission made the accusation of &quot;callous violation of the principles of trusteeship to the natives&quot;, towhich the Chancellor of the Exchequer had demurred,and which really amounted, to an attack on the Govern-ment of this &quot;Country over a series of years, notwith-standing that the matter lay outside the Terms ofReference to the Commission,.   He asked that publication should be postponed until the Cabinet had had anopportunity of considering Paragraphs 204-8-2068 ofthe Report.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said hewould have a good deal to say, at the right moment, onthe merits of this question, on which he, like all his predecessors, felt very strongly.    For the moment,however, he contented himself with drawing attentionto the impossibility of getting the Commission to alter the Report or of postponing its publication forlong.   As to the former proposal, the Chairman of theCommission, he believed, was still in London, though he was about to leave for Kenya;   but other members were in Kenya.    In the circumstances it would not be physically possible for them to meet at the presenttime to alter their Report,.even if they were willingto do so.   As a matter of fact, however, he was - aware that they attached great importance to this matter.
and he was convinced that they would never agree to alter their Report.Apart from that, there was the fact that theReport, according to present arrangements, was to hepublished both in this country and in Kenya in two days&apos; time:    that was to say, on May 4th.   The copieswere all ready for publication, and it would be physically impossible, without great delay and expense, to re-print a number of pages of the Report,more especially as it was a Kenya document.    Suchdelay, however, would be extremely embarrassing, for adminsitrative reasons.   Certain new mining leaseswere to be issued shortly in Kenya, and prior to this it was necessary to obtain the issue of a MiningOrdinance in that Colony,   This could not be doneuntil the Report was published.   He would find itdifficult to suggest any reason for holding tip afterMay 4th the publication of the Report, which had been promised both at home and in Kenya.The Cabinet then turned to the question of whetherit would be possible to take a decision on thefinancial point at issue before publication.    Thetime available was limited by the facts, firstly, that before the Whitsuntide Recess the Secretary ofState for the Colonies would have to make a statement in the House of Commons, and., secondly, that it wouldnot be fair to the House of Commons for him to make that statement before Members had had the Reportin their possession for a few days.    It was appre-ciated,   however, that if a decision could bereached on the financial point, it might be announcedeither in writing with the Report or by the Secretaryof State in making his statement.
A suggestion was made to the Chancellor of theExchequer that possibly the difficulty might be surmounted by an ex gratia payment, which would be smaller than the total claim:   but the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer pointed out that this solution, even ifacceptable, would be very much harder after publicationof the Report, as it would look like yielding to oxits idepressure from persons who had heard only one side ofthe case.In this connection the Cabinet were reminded thatone of the difficulties of this matter was that noreasoned case had been issued by the Government for refusing the grants.The First Commissioner of Works reported that during his visit to Kenya in 1924 these claims had beenbrought up in practically every native village he   had visited,    Fe thought it probable that the commission had. met with the same experiencee and that they hadregarded the claims as part of the land grievance ofthe natives, for the reason that the natives were inthe habit of asking how they could trust the BritishGovernment in the matter of land when the claims inrespect of the porters had never been met.A suggestion was made that there should be aconsultation between the Chancellor of the Exchequer,the Gecr6rtary of State for War and the Secretary ofState for the Colonies with a view to reaching an accommodation, but the Chancellor of the Exchequerfelt that no useful purpose would be served by such consultation and that it would be better that each side should submit their case to the Cabinet *The Cabinet agreed on the following procedure:-(a) That the Cabinet should, consider thequestion at their next weekly Meetingon Wednesday, May 9th:(b) That for this Meeting Memoranda shouldbe prepared and. circulated -
By the Secretary of State forthe Colonies:(ii)By the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Secretary of State for Warin co-operation if possible.(&quot;he Prime Minister particv-larly ashed that not morethan two Papers should be circulated.)(c) That publication of the Report shouldbe postponed until Thursday, May 10th,and that when issued the Report might&apos;perhaps be accompanied by a statement ofthe Government&apos;s decision on the financialpoint dealt with in Paragraphs 2048-206fi;(d.) That the Secretary of State for theColonies should telegraph to Kenyain order, if possible, to securepostponement of publication untilThursday, May 10th:(e) ^hat the Secretary of State for theColonies should make his statement inParliament on Monday, May 14th,  inorder that the Opposition might havean opportunity,  if they so desired, toraise the question in the &quot;Debate onthe Whitsuntide Adjournment.
THE COTTONMANUFACTURING^INDUSTRY&quot;^temporary provisions)RILL.(previous reference:Cabinet IS(34), C on-elus ion 5 .)5.      The Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumby the Minister of labour (H.A.-29 (34)) covering thedraft Cotton Manufacturing Industry (Temporary Provi-sions) Bill, which was designed to give power to theMinister of Labour to give effect to agreed wage rates,and the conditions surrounding them, if forming partof an agreement voluntarily reached by the organisations of the employers and the employed in the Cotton Manu-facturing Industry:    together with the following recommendation of the Committee of Home Affairs thereon(H.A.0. 9 th C onelusions (34)):-&quot;To authorise the introduction forthwith in the House of Commons of the CottonManufacturing Industry (Temporary Pro-visions) Bill, in the form of the draft annexed to H.A.-29 (34), subject to any drafting or other minor alterations that might be found necessary or desirable irable .&quot;The Cabinet agreed -(a) To approve the recommendation ofthe Committee of Home Affairs asset forth above.(b) That the following names should beplaced on the back of the Bill -Sir Henry Betterton,Mr. Hudson,Mr. Runciman.
THE LICENSING(&apos; STANDARD ISA-TION OP HOURS)BILL.(previous reference:Cabinet 17(34), Con-elusion IS.)6. The Cabinet had under consideration again the Licensing (standardisation of Hours) Bill,introduced in the House of Commons by a private member and down for Report and Third Reading onFriday, May 4th.The PIoine Secretary thought that it was probablethat this Bill would be talked out, and that no action would be necessary on behalf of the Govern-ment.(See also following Conclusion.)
HOTELS AND 7.      In connection with the short discussion onRESTAURANTSBILL. the preceding Conclusion,  the Home Secretary said.   .  *that he was to receive a deputation that afternoonJ^Lcensing andBummer Time. on the Hotels and Restaurants Bill.      He did notthink that the sponsors of this Bill had any hope(previous reference: in the present session though they were likely to cabinet 3 (34)Conclusion 18).      ask whether the Government would give facilities in the next session of Parliament,      One aspect ofthe question which they were likely to raise was therecent judicial decision now subject to an appealthat allowance should not be made for summer timein granting licences.      The deputation would want toknow whether the Government contemplated legislation in the event of the failure of the appeal.      such legislation would only involve a one-clause bill.The Cabinet agreed -(a) That on the question of the Hotels and restaurants Bill the Home Secretary shouldcontent himself with listening to whatthe deputation had to say and promise to report their views to the Cabinet.(b) That on the question of licensing appealhe should say that the attitude of theGovernment was to wait and see what wasthe result of the appeal which appearedto him to deal with a rather technicalmatter.
8.      The Secretary of State for War, as Leader ofthe House of Lords, called the attention of theCabinet as a matter of urgency to the present positionof the Tithe Bill.      This Bill, it will he recalled,contained two operative Clauses, namely, Clause 1,dealing with remission of Tithe Rent Charge, andClause 2, with an alternative mode of recoveringTithe Rent Charge, etc.        He recalled that when thematter was considered at the Cabinet they had been told that the Opposition would clamour for a public enquirybut the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries had thought at the time that there was no case for suchan enquiry, and that the relief afforded to hardcases by this Bill would meet the present situation.The forecast of a demand for an enquiry had provedcorrect and a very strong opposition to the Bill had developed.      In the House of Lords Earl de la Warr andLord Stanhope had succeeded in obtaining a second read-ing by 48 to 17 but since then the opposition had developed further against the principle of makingtithe a personal debt.      He also understood that theMinister of Agriculture and Fisheries was less strongly opposed than before to an enquiry.      He gathered thatwhichthe suggestion/had commended itself to the Minister ofAgriculture was that the Government should insist on a third reading of the Tithe Bill and should then promisean enquiry.      He himself felt, however,  that thatwas not a wise way in which to approach the House ofLords.      He thought that the question of an enquiryought to be settled before the Bill was taken.      Theposition at the moment was that a proposal was to bemade in the House of Lords to refer the Bill to a select Committee.      Tomorrow he would have to decidewhen this resolution would be considered, and at themoment he was contemplating Monday next, May 7th.      He-14-
brought the question before the Cabinet, however, for a decision as to whether the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries was satisfied that the third reading could be secured and as to whether an enquiry was to be granted, and,  if so, at what stage.

The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries who attended this meeting in the absence of the Minister who was still indisposed, said that the Ministry did not welcome an enquiry and thought that it might be possible to force the Bill through the House of Lords and by the personal intervention of the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, through the House of Commons also. To such a policy, however,  considerable political and social reactions in the countryside must be expected. Before the Bill was introduced the Ministry had consulted representatives of a number of agricultural bodies  but though these representatives had received the proposals in the Bill in a friendly way, they had not been able in every case to convince the bodies they represented and consequently had to take up a stiffer attitude than they would have adopted as individuals. The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries had been consulted and had left it to himself and the Permanent Secretary to give advice but he was prepared to agree to an enquiry. There had been some consultation with Queen Anne&apos;s Bounty and the Archbishop of Canterbury whose reaction to an enquiry had not been so hostile as before.

It has been Eug? that if an enquiry were decided on it would be ? to ? its arrangement united the Third Reading of the Bill. He agreed ? that for the ?  the Committee staff would be ? 

The Ministry were now prepared to agree to an enquiry the terms of which would be as wide as possible so as to include the means by which ultimately tithes would be extinguished and converted into ordinary debts. His idea was that 
notwithstanding the announcement of an enquirythe Bill should f ira-t he passed in order to avoidloss of prestige to the Government and to saveClause 2.        The grant of an enquiry would he used the,as an opportunity to secure/withdrawal of theopposition to the Bill and to exercise a favourableinfluence on the countryside.      He thought that thiscourse would he acceptable.      In confirmation of this he recalled that the critics of the Bill had askedfor some relief in hard cases as well as an enquiry,which would probably have to taice the form of a royal Commission.In the course of the discussion on thisproposal doubts were expressed as to the resultof this policy.      History might repeat itself and assurances of support might fail.      The lav/on tithe would be changed by this Bill which wouldmake tithe a personal charge.      People might notbe willing to accept that as the basis of an enquiry which of course would have to be madeunder the existing law.      On the other hand, it was recognised that without the Bill nothing would bedone for the existing situation which would evenget worse owing to the fact of the enquiry.One suggestion wae that the proposalfor a Select Committee should be adopted and theSelect Committee procedure should be turned intoa general enquiry.The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministryof Agriculture and Fisheries pointed out, however,that the title of the Bill would narrow the enquirytoo much for this to be possible.The Secretary of State for War agreed withthis view.
The Lord Chancellor said that if an enquiry  3was to be held it would he a pity to alienatethe Governments friends, some of whom had nowturned against the Bill.        The Archbishop of canterbury had been himself very lukewarm aboutClause 2.        He thought the best plan would be totake advantage of the proposal to refer the Billto a Select Committee.        This would give theGovernment time although in the end it might benecessary to hold a wider enquiry.The Prime Minister thought it might bepossible to accept the referring of the Bill to a select Committee.      At a later stage the Governmentcould announce a Royal Commission and the SelectCommittee could then be dropped.The Secretary of State for War suggestedthat the Bill should be sent to a Select Committeein order to see what evidence was obtained before making final decision.The Prime Minister thought this might be agood plan and the appointment of a Royal commission could,  if desirable, be announced later.      If theopposition to the Bill continued and grew the bill could be dropped, otherwise the Bill might be passed.The Secretary of State for War said that hewas prepared, if necessary, to announce that thebusiness of the House of Lords did not enable theTithe Bill to be taken up next week.      Possibly evenit might be impossible to take it before Whitsuntide.The Cabinet agreed -(a) That the Secretary of State for War,as Leader of the House of Lords, should arrange that the Tithe Bill should not come up for consideration on Monday,May 7th.(b) That the Ministry of Agriculture andFisheries should circulate a memorandum containing definite proposals forconsiderati on by the cabinet at their next meeting on Wednesday,May 9th.-17-
