mPRANCE.Bar thou&apos;ssit .l**he ProposedlEas tern Loc arno](previous( Reference:! Cabinet 23(34), Con-1 elusion 1.)1. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that M, Barthou, the french foreign Minister, had been visiting various countriesin Central and Eastern Europe, and had. upset a good many people by his speeches against revision of thePeace Treaties .    In connection with his forthcoming visit to this country M. Barthou had asked for alist of the subjects to be discussed.    In reply hehad been reminded of the cirexmstances in which the visit had. been arranged, and had. been informed, thatwe had. no long list of subjects for discussion.   Thepossible reception in Syria of Assyrians from Iraqhad been mentioned, and it was anticipated that something would be said about Naval questions. TheSecretary. of State/ thought it, probable that M, Barthou would wish toknow our views  on the proposal for an Eastern LocarnoSo far he himself had rather steered clear of expressing any view on this proposal, more especially as an Eastern Locarno pre-supposed the co-operationof Germany, and. there was every evidence thatGermany did not mean to take part.   He was inclined to adhere to this view.
REDUCTION ANDIMITATION of armaments.(previous reference:Cabinet 83(34), Con-elusion 1.)2. No discussion took place on the question ofthe- Reduction and Limitation of Armaments, hut theSecretary to the Cabinet was instructed to keep itpermanently on the Agenda Paper.

BELGIUM 4. The Cabinet had before them the Most SecretSuggested Minutes of a Meeting of the Ministerial Committee onDeclarationregarding. Disarmament held on June 21st  (D.C.(m) 49th Meeting)on the subject of   a    proposed Declaration regarding(Previous BelgianReference: /Independence, at which the following conclusions wereCabinet 33 7(34), Con- reached:-elusion 2,)(i) To recommend to the Cabinet that weF$.4y . should accept in principle -(a) That the defence of Belgian terri-tory against foreign aggression isa vital British interest which wemust in ease of need activelysustain, and(b) &quot;&quot;hat this fact should be publiclyplaced on record, at the presenttime:(ii) That before a final decision can be takenit is necessary to ensure that there are no practical objections to the proposal, andfor this purpose the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs would, circulate to the three defence Departments, for their consideration and concurrence, a note as to the essentialmatters which would, condition our proposed- &apos;   declaration in respect of Belgian independ-ence. (See paragraph 4 of D.C.(m)(32) 119)%-  (iii) That while it is not desired to lay downdefinitely any procedure at the presentmoment, the question of early communica-tion with the Dominions and the methodof such communication is one of primary importance:    in any event the Dominionswill be communicated with before any communication is made to Belgium:- (iv) ^o remit the CommitteeTs recommendations for consideration by the Cabinet at its next Meeting.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reportedthat he had consulted the Ministers at the head of theDefence Departments on the matters referred to in (ii)above.   The Secretary of State for War had. suggestedthat, before a public Declaration could be made, the strategical implications of the proposed declaration should be investigated by the Chiefs of Staff committee it was true that what was proposed was only a clarifies,tion of the Locarno engagement, making clear that ifwe did have to help&apos;Belgium we woxjld come to her assistance with all our power, and letting it be known
in advance that we would take action.   mhe Secretaryof State for War had pointed out, however, that theTreaty of Locarno also provided a guarantee for Germany,and that a Declaration on the lines proposed, applying to Belgium only, would fit in rather oddly with aTreaty which provided a guarantee to both parties *The Secretaries of State both for War and Air had pointed out that it was very necessary, in our own interest and protection, to know what steps Belgiumwas taking for her own defence, lest she should trustherself entirely to our P/eclarstio1 and make no adequatepreparation.   He therefore invited the Cabinet -(l) To accept in principle the first-Conclusion of the Ministerial Committee,(2) To invite the Chiefs of Staff Committeeto examine the military implications ofthe Treatjr.(S) To keep the subject on the Agenda.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs askedwhether that meant suspending any communication to theDominions?     He recalled that when the Dominions hadbeen consulted about the Locarno Treaty General smuts had pointed out the danger to the Empire if one partof the Empire became involved in a war and. was assisted by some Dominions but not by all.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thoughtthat consultation with the Dominions should stand over until the Cabinet had taken a decision.The Secretary of State for India suggested, thatthese kinds of aspects ought, to be cleared up as soonas possible, in order that a statement might/be made before the Parliamentary Recess.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reportedthat there had already been some approach by Germanyto Belgium, and the Belgians had reacted badly to it.
There &quot;appeared every possibility of Germany sayingthat she did approve of our proposed Declaration,but if the Germans themselves offered a non-aggressionperiodpact to Belgium for a limited y   it seemed possiblethat Belgium would refuse, on the ground that shealready had the Locarno Treaty, for which no time limit was fixed.The Secretary of State for War said his suggestion had been to refer to the Chiefs of Staff Committee the strategical implications of the proposed Declarationof our attitude towards Belgium as set forth inConclusion (i)(a) of the Paper before the Cabinet.He had contemplated, however, that preliminaryconversations would be entered on without waiting fortheir Report.    He had mentioned also certain points that ought to be borne in mind:-(l) that the Declaration was not of muchvalue to Belgium unless it was followed up by military conversations and weequipped ourselves with the means to implement it I(S) that we ought to be informed of theBelgian conceptions of their own defence,e.g&quot;., the nature of their plan of defence.He had also raised the point that under the Treaty of locarno we might, in theory, be called upon to assistGermany against Belgium, and it would therefore be rather awkward to ask the Belgians to tell us their plans.   He had added, other points:    for example, thatwe must have some conversations with the Belgians onthe question of their plans and preparations, in orderto ensure that they did not lie back, and do nothingafter we had made our Declaration:    and. that we musthave some guarantee that Belgian foreign policy was soconducted that they could not get into a war without consulting us.    A further point arose as to how anarmy was to reach Belgium.    It might be necessary toobtain the use of French ports, and. this might be a
matter for the Belgians to arrange rather than ourselves.    Finally, there was the consultationwith the Dominionsj but he was not suggesting that&apos;all this should, wait until the Report of the Chiefsof Staff was received.Comment was made on the formidable list of questions mentioned by the Secretary of State forWar, and it was suggested that for the moment onlya short Report on them was required...The Prime Minister wished to avoid any unnecessarydelay, but wanted the Cabinet to be perfectly clearas to what was involved, in this proposal.   Therewere three points on which we ought to be very careful:    first, we must be clear what were thepossible consequences of the proposed Declaration.In this connection he had in mind such points asCm- ka/uA- frailt-trt-i Cd+UaMthe guarantee to Germany involved in Locarno, which/Government in taking its decision to make theDeclaration.    The Government would certainly beasked about this .    Second, were the Cabinet quite sure that the political situation in Europe was sofixed, that we could forecast the political effectof the Declaration?,  What, for example, would be theeffect on Germany?   Was the Germany of today the sameas the Germany of a fortnight ago, and. what would bethe Germany of two months hence?    It was necessarynot to overlook the significance of M* Barthou&apos;visit to Eastern Europe, which might be a move ina policy of forcing Germany to become an aggressor.mhird, ought we not to know the French attitude?He himself felt that we ought to let the world know that if Belgium were invaded we would not berightc ould be us ed t o /(s-h-e*?state of mind of the
was absolutely essential.    If M. Barthou&apos;s foreignpolicy was the same a-e it appeared to be, Prancemight say, after our Declaration,  west are now safe: -if we can only get Germany to invade Belgium, England.is behind us and we can settle it as in 1914&quot;.The Cabinet ought to decide, first, what would bethe commitment *,    secondly, what would be the position.in Europe after the Declaration^ which depended onCothe French attitude:    and, thirdly, what w-ould be.tVttX&quot; lucU 9its - effect in Europe.    Instead of a Declarationproving a tranquillising process it might merelyLiubring about a re-orientation of a- -new militarysituation in Europe.   He himself felt that there wasno y-ery- great hurry in the matter.The Chancellor of the Exchequer emphasised thatthe point of paramount importance was the first partof Conclusion (i):-&quot;(a) That the defence of Belgian territory-against foreign aggression is a vitalBritish interest which we must, in caseof need, actively sustain&quot;.If that were true, nothing in the policy of any other country could alter the fact.   Whatever M. Barthoumight do, that would remain the vital british interests, and he thox?ght that should be made clear.He was rather apprehensive of missing the rightmoment for a Declaration.   We might get into aposition (e .g., if some country was threatening&apos;Belgium) when the Declaration could not be made without appearing provocative.   The present moment was rather favourable.    He hoped the Cabinet wouldnot confuse a unilateral Declaration with anAgreement in which Belgium offered us something inreturn.   What was now proposed was a purely unilateral declaration made entirely in our own interests.
We had no right to say to Belgium &quot;If we make this declaration, you in return roust do so-and-so&quot;, for itwas not a Treaty.   What we- could do was to give the belgians an intimation, before we made the Declaration,that we should not be able to defend Belgium unlesstoshe took steps to defend herself, and/tell her thatwe should expect to be informed as to what effortsshe was making.    Before making the Declaration,however, he would not do more than let the Belgiansknow that we should expect to have this information.The Postmaster-General ins is ted on the need forthe proper preparation of public opinion.    Prom that point of view he would like to see some preliminarydeclaration by Germany *   At the present time any declaration as to our Interest- in Belgian integrity,coming without preliminary warning, would cause greatpublic perturbation.The Prime Minister said that ideally, and on paper,he was prepared to say that if Germany could be persuaded to announce that she never had any intentionof invading Belgian territory, and wished that to be known among the nations of Europe, we might then makea statement recalling that throughout history we had insisted on the independence of Belgium as essentialto our national safety, and that we wished, it to be publicly known/   that, this attitude was permanent in our history.That was his actual view, but he saw that it wasdangerous to make a Declaration to which each nation-  Belgium, Prance   Germany  ,etc.   might give aCM AtQCvih Xu,f\CM(vi-u&apos;ui^different interpretation/.   He thought that no voicewould, be lifted in the Cabinet\against the statement in Conclusion (i)(a), but he thought that the words&quot;at the present time&quot; should be deleted from (i)(b). &apos;
The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat the Belgians had sent a high permanent officialover to London, who had reported to the Foreign office that the Belgian Government had been rather embarrassedat the German Government having intimated that if they made a declaration of non-aggression our Governmentwould welcome it.    It was quite true that we should welcome such a declaration, and he himself had giventhe German Ambassador a hint to this effect.    TheBelgian attitude was that they rather complained ofthis, and intimated that what they wanted was aDeclaration, not from Germany, but from the UnitedKingdom.    He would probably be asked about our attitudeby the German Ambassador, and he intended to say -unless his colleagues dissented. - that we shouldfavour such a declaration because of our own Interestin the integrity of Belgium.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that thatwould be done by a unilateral declaration.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thought the best way might be -(l) a Declaration of our attitude as setforth in Conclusion (i)(a)t    and(3) a simultaneous statement that we- had informed, the Germans that we proposedto make this Declaration, that theywelcomed it and had no intention of re-opening the question of Belgianboundaries.fj,lal defence The First Commissioner of Works reminded the--my.cessation,a . Cabinet that the Ministerial Committee had alsop&apos;1 evxous^Hn-tCo- contemplated a statement on the re-armament programmeHue Ion?&quot;) which, so far as the Army and the Royal Air force were concerned, was closely linked up with the proposed declaration to Belgium.   Was the statement of our attitude to Belgium to precede the statement on re-armament , or vice versa?
The Postmaster-General thought that if there wasto be a statement on re-armament the matter becameworse from the point of view of public opinion.The Secretary of State for India recalled that atthe Ministerial Committee there had been an idea ofa Debate on the subject of Imperial Defence,  in which,the whole programme, both on armaments and policy,might be put into perspective.The Lord President of the Council said that forthe moment all that it was necessary to announcewas what we were going to do in the matter ofthe Royal Air Force.   The less that was said aboutother matters the better.   When, however, the provisionof air forces came to be discussed, an opportunitymight arise for explaining the importance of preventingany other country from establishing aerodromes withinstriking distance of this country.   that might arise in the first Debate, or in some later Debate.   At themoment, however, he only contemplated an announcementof what we intended to do in the air.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs suggestedin Conclusion fi)(b) to substitute for the phrase&quot;at the present time&quot; the words &quot;at an early and.suitable opportunity&quot;.(This was agreed to.)The Postmaster-General was glad, to hear the lord president&apos;s ideas on the subject.   He thought it mostimportant not to spring the whole proposal without-adequate preparation.The Prime Minister pointed out that the proposed statement- to Belgium was only part of a much largersubject. The question was not at all a simple one.If it remained on the Agenda Paper of the Cabinetall sorts of new contributions would be made to thesubject and, a decision would never be reached.

He uttered a warning about enteringprematurely on conversations with the Belgians, asthe news would be almost certain to leak out in Europe.The Foreign Office, however, should, consider thesoundings to be taken with the Belgian, French,German, etc . Governments ,   The matter should thencome before the Cabinet again on a Report by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To accept in principle the following recommendations of the ministerial committee on Disarmament, as amended by the Cabinet, viz.:-(i) That the defence of Belgian terri-tory against foreign aggression isa vital British interest which wemust,  in.case of need, activelysustain;    and(ii) That this fact should be placed on record at an early and suitable opportunity:(b) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should take up with the MinistersH*l&apos;U dUMcL i H the he*d ?f * j Defence Departments&apos; - the essential matters which. ---^ A * A

GOVERNMENTINDUSTRIALESTAB IISHMENT SHours ofEmp 1 oym ent in.Proposed 40-Pour Week.(previous reference:Cabinet 10(30), Con-elusion 5.)6.      The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by. the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C.P.-157 (34))stating that the Trade Union Side o-F&apos; the Joint Co-ordinating Committee for Government industrial establishments had asked for a meeting of theCommittee to consider a claim for the reduction ofthe hours of Government Industrial Employeesgenerally to 40 per week without reduction in wages.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that a concession of this order to industrial staff could,not. fail to react upon Post Office ManipulativeWorkers and. probably also on certain Civil Serviceoffice staffs:    also that so large a discrepancybetween Government Industrial Establishments and outside industry would give rise to many practicaldifficulties and would be very hard, to justify.   he therefore proposed, to instrvict the Government repre-sentatives on the Joint Co-ordinating Committee toinform the Trade Unions that the Government could not accept the claim, for reasons set out in   his Memorandum.The Prime Minister, while agreeing with theproposals of the Chancellor of the Exchequer,pointed out that the idea of a 40 hour week wasattractive to many people of a theoretical habit of mind.      The&quot;real question was how the advantageof the increased output per man under modern conditions could he shared with the mass of thepeople without lowering the prices of commodities.The Cabinet approved the proposals of theChancellor of the Exchequer set forthinC P.  157 (34),
UNEMPLOYMENT 7.    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bySSIS^ANCE)ARD. the Minister of Labour (CP.-166 (34)) entitledDate of the &quot;Unemployment Assistance Board: Date of the FirstFirst Appoint-5,3 Day. Appointed Day&quot;.    Since the matter was last beforethe Cabinet he had discussed it with the Chancell -r(previous reference: of the Exchequer, who had. satisfied him that, in cabinet 21(34), Con- spite of the difficulties stated in his previouselusion 5.)Memorandum   CP.-134 (34)), they must aim at fixing the First Appointed Day early in November.   TheMinister of Labour then set out a time-table whichwould have to be adhered to if this object was to beachieved.   He pointed out that it would be necessaryfor the Cabinet to approve the Board.&apos;s draft fegula-tions before they were submitted, to Parliament, forwhich purpose the draft must first be examined by aCabinet Committee, which would have to be ready to sit in the first week in October.    In view of the factthat the time required for the consideration of theregulations by the Board, and. subsequently by theMinister of Labour and the Cabinet, might prove longer than contemplated in his time-table, and that the mechanical difficulties of setting up such a largeorganisation might make the start of the scheme atthe beginning of November impossible, the Ministerof Labour felt it important that no announcement should be made at present or promise given that theFirst Appointed Day would be as early as November.The Minister of Labour reported that the more closely he examined this question the moreimpressed was he with the amount of preparatory work that had to be done.      He did not feel thatit would be fair to ask the officials of the Depart-ments concerned to work right through the holiday
season which was likely to he entailed in order to fix &quot;&amp;he Appointed Day early in November.      He,therefore,  suggested that the Chairman of theUnemployment Assistance Board should acquaintthe Minister of Labour with the position sometimein September and advise him as to whether November 1stwas a possible date.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, while fullyrecognising the difficulties of the Minister ofLabour, emphasised that unless the new arrangements could be put in operation before the winter, he would find it difficult to resist the strong pressure of Local Authorities for more assistance from theExchequer.      He might be able to stave them off ifthe Appointed Day could be not later than January 1st,though his officials had not abandoned hope of theearlier date.        In any event,  it was mostimportant to get the scheme in operation before thewinter was over.      Otherwise every kind of grievancethat arose from the continuance of the old scheme would be exaggerated and create political difficulties for the Government.The Cabinet agreed -(a) That no definite decision should betaken at the present stage.(b) That the Minister of Labour should ascertain progress in September witha view to a decision in the early autumn.(c) That some information as to the datemust be given to the Local Authoritiesin September when they make up their estimates.(d) That before the end of the present session a statement should be made inthe House of Commons to the following effect -&quot;Every effort will be made tocomplete the - necessary arrangements
at the earliest possible date,so that the First Appointed Daymay be fixed shortly after theregulations have been approved byParliament after its reassemblesin the autumn.&quot;That arrangements must be made for cabinet consideration of theregulations not later than thebeginning of October.That the question of the SecondAppointed Day and the Minister ofHealth&apos;s desire that it should beon Quarter Day should be discussed between the Ministers concerned.
loAL MINES. 8.    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theInternational   Minister of Labour (C .P.-164 (34)) containing proposedConventionlimiting Hours instructions to the British Government Delegates to%f Work.  the International Labour Conference, Geneva, on the;proposed In-Itruetions to   subject of the Coal Mines Hours Convention.   A Tri-Britishgovernment partite Conference of the seven countries principallydelegates.concerned was to meet at Geneva on June 26th to discussfiPrevious the possibilities of ratification, and it was suggestedReference:Cabinet 30       that the British Government representative should(33), Con-elusion 7.)     maintain the general line of policy of benevolencet JF*  &apos;        &apos; towards the Convention, subject to the two conditionsOf simultaneous ratification by the other principalEuropean countries and of the adjustment of certain technical difficulties of application, such adjustmentpresumably requiring a revision of the Convention.To meet certain difficulties that might arise in thecourse of the discussions (e.g., whether the convention should necessarily be adopted also by some of. the extra-European countries before coming into force,, and whetherthe relative wages in different countries.should be -considered before ratification), the Minister of laboursubmitted that the British Government representative should be allowed to use his discretion to modify thepolicy hitherto laid down in matters of detail, whileadhering to it.  in principle.The following comment on this Memorandum bythe Prime Minister had been forwarded to the Ministerof Labour -&quot;Do not allow ourselves to get into a.positionof hostility.      Favour fairly but insist onequality and practicality.&quot;The Minister of Labour reported that a message to this effect had been forwarded to the british representatives at Geneva.The Cabinet approved the instructions inthe Memorandum by the Minister of Labour,CP,  164 (34).
IE BRITISH 9.     The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum byIrCANTILEJrINE, .  the President of the Board of Trade (C.P.-161 (34))on the Position of the British Mercantile Marine,which had been under consideration by a CabinetCommittee appointed at the Meeting referred to in the margin.    At the end of his Memorandum the Presidentof the Board of Trade summed up the points  on which adecision was required as follows :-(i) The proposal that a fighting subsidy, to cost not more than  2,000,00C and aimed atbringing, about the discontinuance of foreignsubsidies,  should, be granted for a year toBritish ships carrying tramp cargoes, pro-vided. a satisfactory scheme for applying thesubsidy is produced by the shipowners incor-porating the conditions laid down in para-graph 6 (See paragraphs 5 to 7).(ii) The proposal that consideration should begiven to the grant of subsidies in special cases to British liners prejudiced bysubsidised foreign competition in parti-cular trades if the grant of financialassistance appears to be the best methodof assistance (See paragraph 14).(iii) mhe proposal that financial assistance on lines contemplated by the Cabinet Committeeshould be made available by the Governmentfor a scrapping and building scheme if andwhen it appears that such a scheme would beused by the shipping industry (See paragraph(iv) The preparation in due course of legislation to sanction the grant of a fighting subsidy,the grant of subsidies to liners in special cases, the grant of financial assistance for building and modernising on conditionof scrapping (should, this be found, desirable)and. the concession as to fees referred toin paragraph 18, and to deal with any other relevant matters .Is it ion of.previous reference:cabinet 69(;?*), Con-elusion 5.)Comment was made on the short notice at whichthe Cabinet were asked to decide this very largequestion of policy.The President of the Board of Trade reportedthat he had been under great pressure during the whole year by representatives of the shipping organisations and lately by the Press to announce the Government&apos;policy.      He had not been able to press the Governmentfor a decision earlier owing to the lack of agreement
among the shipping organisations.      ^-m&apos;-r-^e^^r-&amp;-ry      JGiCpMWuui&apos; Ua cLi LuCla*li^j       So fatal&apos;, Oi IS Lin fi^iMcWaUmeet w (Mtrtoy-ffere moru jop leoo in agraement-w4^-^wilf^^ ,Jua*\&apos;Ult*lftcncuUi OffVMv\r^l&apos;awiSFajueA, lUil&apos;Ut did no.&quot; fed Ukcd&apos; U.quest-i-oa any long-ag-.-     The subject had been underconsideration for a long time by a Cabinet Committeeto -which a great deal of material had been circulated.The Cabinet Committee supported his recommendationsunanimously.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs asked if when this policy was announced Australia andNew Zealand would be relieved from the request thatthey should not take retaliatory action against theMatson Line.The President of the Board of Trade said thattelegrams would be sent to the Governments of Australiaand New Zealand which would leave them free fromany persuasion on our part/to take any action they thought fit/&apos;and -witfr full knowledge of the risks involved.The Secretary of State for the Colonies pointedout that action would not be taken on the Government&apos;decision until the shipping organisations had themselvesworked out details.The Secretary of State for War reminded theCabinet that a debate would take place on thissubject in the House of Lords in a week&apos;s time andfrom that point of view it would be a great advantage if the President of the Board of Trade could make his announcement as proposed on Tuesday next, July 3rd,The Secretary of State for India, while agreeingwith the proposals of the President of the Board ofTrade, asked that consideration should be given totheir possible reaction on the proposals for shippingincluded in the Indian &quot;White Paper at the request ofthe Board of Trade,

11.    The Secretary of State for the Colonies raised the question of legislation to enforce a quota in ceylon.    He reminded the Cabinet that on the 18th ofApril the decision had been t aken that legislation for this purpose should, if necessary, be carried by certification under the paramount power.      It was realised then that the exercise of this power might lead to a constitutional crisis in Ceylon.      It had appeared that Ministers were prepared to introduce the necessary legislation, and they had telegraphedon the 17th of May assuring him of their desire to respond;    stating that they were willing to introduce the necessary legislation, but expressing the hopethat an increased preference might be given on Ceylonplumbago and that a duty might be imposed on foreignsoya beans.      After consultation with the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the President of the Board ofTrade,  the Secretary of State had replied on the18th of June expressing appreciation of Ministers&apos;willingness to introduce a system of quota restrictions and explaining the position with regard to plumbagoand soya beans.      With regard to plumbago, thePresident of the Board of Trade considered that anincrease in the duty would be ineffective, as british manufacturers, for technical reasons, insisted onusing Madagascar plumbago.      Soya beans raiseddifficult questions, both administrative and agricultural.      It would be impossible in the laststages of the Finance Bill to arrive at a decision and legislate on  this subject, but His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would review the matter further in orderto assess the benefit of a duty to Colonial products,and to see whether action is practicable.      TheSecretary of State had also emphasised in his telegram the great advantage which Ceylon enjoyed under the
tea and rubber control schemes.      On the 26th ofJune Ministers telegraphed that there was no prospect of the Council accepting the quota proposals;that they were unwilling to introduce such legislation,hut th, t they proposed as an alternative a removalof existing duties on Empire textiles,  thus affordinga preference of 10 per cent., combined with a cashbounty of 10 per cant,  to importers of UnitedKingdom textiles.      The Governor reported thatinsistence on quota legislation would lead to a constitutional crisis, and that there was aconsiderable risk that the Council would adopt apolicy of non-co-operation.      The Secretary of Statefor the Colonies had consulted the President of theBoard of Trade , who inf oiasd him that the proposedpreference and oounty would be quite ineffective;    andthat a very much larger duty would be necessaryin order to give an effective preference.Legislation to give effect to the quota had been passed or was passing in practically every Colony,including the Straits Settlements and the malay states.      This legislation had been carried in somecases including the Straits Settlements, by anofficial majority,    /^Sxs felt, therefore,  that there could be no question of altering the original decision of the Cabinet.      He thought, however,that as Ministers had proposed an alternative systemof duties,  there would be some advantage in giving them the opportunity of proposing an effective rateof duty,  and he suggested that he should agree&quot;with the President of the Board of Trade what rateof duty -would be effective, and should inform theGovernor that if that rate was introduced and carried,  that could be accepted as a satisfactory alternative for the present,  though it would have-
to be subject to reconsideration if the dutysystem proved ineffective for its purpose.      TheSecretary of State for the Colonies asked that he,together with the Lord President,  the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the President of the Board ofTrade,  should have discretion to proceed either byway of a preference on a scale satisfactory to thePresident of the Board of Trade, or by wayof a quota.The Cabinet approved the above proposal.
