1.   The Prime Minister said that he had spoken by telephone to the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, at Geneva, that morning.   He gathered that not much had happened as yet.   The Secretary of state had had a conversation with M. Barthou and had formed the impression that the French Foreign Minister didnot want a Convention at all and would much prefernot to have to speak.   M. Barthou, however, would be bound to speak today, and would probably take a linejustifying the French position.    The Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs would also speak.     ThePrime Minister had begged him, more particularly inview of M* Litvinoffs speech, to make clear that wewould only enter on embargoes and security arrangements of that kind on the basis of an international Agreement:that is to say, we would, in no circumstances act alone, leaving other countries to make profits out ofthe situation.   The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs had spoken of Mr Norman Davisf s speech as mosthelpful.   Mr Davis had referred in glowing terms to.the attitude of this country, and had made clear thatthe United States of America were prepared, to co-operate in any sort of way short of giving commitments to usearmed forces for the settlement of disputes.   he reported that M. Litvinoffs speech had been innocxxousand he had. given no information as to the mutual guarantee arrangement discussed recently betweenFranc e and Rus s ia .
&apos;    GERMANY.Desire for colonies .(previous reference:Cabinet 13(29) , C on-c lus i on 3 .)2.   The attention of the Cabinet was drawn toPress reports of a ceremony which had taken placeon the previous day at the barracks of the GoeringPolice, at which General Goering had made a somewhataggressive speech on the subject of the recovery ofGermany&apos;s former colonies.The Secretary of State for the Colonies thought the effect of this speech in Africa would not be serious.   He himself had recently repeated, in a wireless broadcast what he had said in Parliament onthe subject, and. this had had. a good effect in africa.   He thought the German Government had been somewhat embarrassed by Lord RothermereTs articleson the subject.   He gathered that Herr Hitler himself was not keen on the return of the German colonies.He thought that no action was necessary.The Cabinet accepted this view.
3* The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP.-146 ( 34)),which had been circulated late on the previous evening, covering the draft of a Note to theGovernment of the United States on the subject ofthe War Debt.    If the Cabinet approved the draft note, the Chancellor proposed that it should besent to Washington at once.The Chancellor of the Exchequer asked, members ofthe Cabinet to make the following small amendments in their copies of C.P.-146 (34):-Page 2, Line 2:     Omit the words &quot;more than&quot;.Page 5, Line 9:     Before the words &quot;the mora-sanatorium&quot; insert the word &quot;But&quot;., *       Line 13:    For &quot;inclusion&quot; substitute&quot;conclusion&quot;.Page 6, Line 14:    For &quot;airmails assistance &quot; put&quot;o ire urns tances&quot;.The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed theCabinet that the general line taken in the Note wasthat we could not carry the burden of paying thewhole of our own debt without receiving anythingfrom our debtors .   We would, have been glad todiscuss a settlement with President Roosevelt, butit was generally agreed that the time for this hadnot yet come.   We should &quot;also have been, prepared tocontinue &quot;token&quot; payments, but Congress had made that impossible by providing that this would not enable us to avoid technical default.   Consequentlywe must pay the whole of the debt with, the arrearsas claimed, if we wished to avoid being designated adefaulter.   The only alternative was to state thatwe coutld not accept responsibility for reopeningthe whole of the War Debt question in Europe, so we proposed to suspend all interim payments untilagreements for a permanent settlement had beenreached... That was the course he proposed to adopt.
He would like to send the Note to Washington beforePresident Roosevelt made his statement on War Debts.Some discussion took place as to whether discretionshould, be given to the British Ambassador atWashington to show the Note privately and confidential -tially to President Roosevelt before its delivery,with the understanding that if he did so he should ask President Roosevelt to reciprocate by showingthe British Ambassador the draft of his reply.The general view of the Cabinet was that theChancellor of the Exchequers draft was so eompre-hensive and so close-knit that it would not bepossible to agree to any material omissions.    Inthese circumstances It was felt that it would bebetter not to run the risk of President Rooseveltasking for omissions or alterations of substanceto which we should find it difficult to as s ent. TW, Ux*-jThe Cabinet agreed -        &apos;     v 0  Cc^i^uMiaUd.(a) To approve the draft Note to theGovernment of the United States onthe subject of the War Debt,enclosed with CP.-146 (34), subjectto the Chancellor of the Exchequerssmall corrections mentioned above:(b) That the Note should be communicatedat once to the British Ambassador in washington, who should, be given anopportunity to make his own comments ,
4. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet thatthere were no further developments on this question,which therefore need, not be discussed.
5. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Home Secretary (C,P.-139 (34)) pointing out thaton May 6, 1935, the &quot;King will have reigned for 25years and that there was an Empire-wide desire tocelebrate the occasion in a becoming manner.Enquiries had already been received from some of theDominions as to the form which the celebrations inthe United Kingdom were likely to take, and to these enquiries it was not possible to give any reply untilat least the main features of the programme were decided on.   He therefore suggested the setting upof a Committee (whose meetings the Lord Chamberlainshould be invited to attend) consisting of -The Home secretary the Secretary of State for India,The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs,The Secretary of State for the Colonies,The First Commissioner of Works -to formulate a scheme for consideration by the Cabinet.The King&apos;s Pleasure would then be taken, and if themain proposals were approved by His Majesty theymight be communicated to the Dominions before the recess.In the course of a discussion suggestions weremade for consideration that the celebrations should include a Naval Review or a Joint Demonstration bythe three Defence Services, in which oversea contin-gents might take part.The Prime Minister informed, the Cabinet that theKing had indicated a desire to avoid excessivedisplay or extravagance of any kind.   What His Majestycontemplated was rather a spontaneous demonstrationfrom one end. of the country to the other.   All theseproposals, however, would be kept in mind by theproposed Cabinet Committee.
The Cabinet were reminded that the Secretary ofState for India was likely to be very busy, and thathe should therefore be allowed to send a representa-tive to the Coromittee.The Cabinet agreed(a) That a Committee, composed as follows:-The Home Secreta-ry (in the Chair),The Secretary of State for India(or representative),The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs,The Secretary of State for theColonies,The Secretary of State for Scotland,The First Commissioner of Works,A Representative of the Chancellorof the Exchequer -should formulate, for consideration bythe Cabinet, a scheme for the eelebra-tion of the 25th anniversary of theKing&apos;s Accession:    the Lord chamberlain and Ministers of other Departments to beinvited to attend meetings as required:(b) That no announcement should be made ofthis Cabinet Committee.
UNITED KINGDOMCOAL TRADE with italy.(Previous^   Reference:1*  Cabinet 70(35), Con-clusion 5.)6. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade (CP.-145 (34))on the subject of the United Kingdom Coal ^rade with italy, in which he gave   particulars of negotiationswith the Italian Commercial Counsellor in London, whohad outlined certain specific reductions in UnitedKingdom duties desired by his Government in returnfor an increased purchase of United Kingdom coal forthe Italian State Railways to 1,000,000 tons a year,the present purchases being practically nil.    Suchan increase of British exports of coal would be ofgreat benefit to the coal industry, particularly inSouth Wales, and would lead, to additional, employment for docks and shipping.    On the other hand, the Italiandesiderata involved, negotiation covering a much wider field than was contemplated at the Meeting referredto in the margin, the Italians having imported intothe discussions the general question of the balanceof trade and other details affecting a number of manufactured articles as well as certain agricultural products.   After reviewing the implications of meeting the Italian wishes, the President of the Board.of Trade felt that advantage should, be taken of this opportunity to help South Wales, but asked hiscolleagues for a decision on the following issue:-Whether he should now proceed to enterinto negotiations with the Italians ona limited basis, endeavouring to restrictour concessions to a narrow field andbearing in mind, the desirability ofobtaining additional exports of SouthWales coal to Italy (if possible up toan amount of 1,000,000 tons) and possibly also certain duty concessions;orWhether, in view of the criticism, whichmight be raised, in Parliament of any furthertariff concessions to foreign countries on industrial products, the discussions shotildbe abandoned, no settlement being reached as to the treatment to be accorded by italy to our coal trade, and endeavours by theItalians to readjust the balance in theirfavoxur being met so far as this is possible by a threat of retaliatory action by this c ountry.- r-
The items on which the Italian commercial counsellor had made specific requests for considera-tion (C143 (34), Para ,3) were examined in some detail.    It was pointed out that to reduce theduty on silk and artificial silk at a time when wewere asking the Colonies to impose a quota on foreignartificial silk would expose us to criticisms from,the Colonies, which were at present responding well to- our appeal.    So far as dairy products were concerned, no objection was taken to the inclusionof gorgonzola cheese, and it was stated, thatpreserved milk was not important so far as Italy was concerned, but was likely to arise again in negotia-tions with Holland.   No strong objection, either, wastaken to possible Marketing Schemes, though it was mentioned that 85 per cent . of our imports of plumsand cherries came from Italy.The Cabinet felt, however, that, in view of theimportance of the glasshouse indue try, carnationsshould, be left out of the agreement, if possible.In this connection it was pointed out that if aremission were made of the duty on carnations theDutch would be the principal beneficiaries.The President of the Board of Trade said that ifthe Cabinet would, give him negotiating powers hewould do his best to see what could be got withoutcarnations.The Cabinet recognised that small centres of grievance would be created by the adoption   ofthese proposals, the cumulative effect of which, from,a political point of view, was by no means negligible.In the national interest, &quot;however, it was felt thatthis disadvantage was more than compensated by theprospect of giving employment to 4,000 men In theMonmouthshire district, a distressed area where itis almost impossible to find any. other form of work.
The President of the Board of Trade said thathe would &quot;he careful to ensure that the ItalianState Railways* purchases of South Wales coal werenot offset by reductions in other orders (by PublicUtility Companies, etc.) forming the tbtal volumeof British coal exports to Italy.   He was asked, ifpossible, to increase the amount of 1,000,000 tons to be purchased by the Italian State Railways, butin view of the great fall in the amount of coal now-exported to Italy from South Wales he did notencourage much hope of this.   He would, of course,make the best use he could, of the superior quality of Welsh as compared with foreign coal.Subject to an undertaking by the President ofthe Board of Trade to drive the best bargain hecould, and to a general desire that carnationsshould, if possible, be omitted from the list of concessions to be made to Italy, the Cabinet agreedThat the President of the Board ofTrade should be authorised to enterinto negotiations with the Italianson the 1imited basis proposed in cp.-143 (34), endeavouring to restrict our concessions to a narrowfield and bearing in mind, the desir-ability of obtaining additionalexports  of South Wales coal to Italy(if possible, up to an amount of1,000,000 tons or more) and possibly also cert ain duty concess ions.
7.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theHome Secretary (C.P.-144 (54)) asking the views ofhis colleagues on the question whether any steps should, be taken by legislation to restrict the wearingof what had. come to be called &quot;Political Uniforms&quot;.Although any legislation would have to be of general application, it would primarily be directed againstthe British Union of Fascists, the only organisation in relation to which any immediate practical problemexisted.   Apart from political considerations, it was clear that from the purely Police point of view theFascists were responsible for a substantial amount of disorder, and. there could be no doubt that the wearingof uniform was an important factor in the problem.The Home Secretary was confident that if some restric-tion were placed on the wearing of uniforms in public by considerable bodies of persons it would be of great assistance to the Police.    He had not thotight fit tosubmit any proposals to the Cabinet as it appeared,doubtful whether the House of Commons in present-circumstances would support the impos it ion of any restrictions.   He suggested, however, that the question should stand over for the present and that in themeantime he should continue to keep a careful watchon developments, with a view to bringing the matter before the Cabinet again if necessary.   If hiscolleagu.es approved this policy the Home secretary proposed to arrange a Question in the House of Commons,in reply to which he would make it clear that, whilethe Government do not propose to take any action atpresent, they do not intend to allow any political organisation, whether of the Right or the Left, to actin such a way as to be a menace to public order, and.that if future developments should make it necessarythey would submit to Parliament such proposals as they thought appropriate.-11-
The Home Secretary informed, the Cabinet thathe now had a question down in Parliament for the same afternoon to which he would have to make a reply.The Government Whips had been making enquiries as tothe feeling of the House of Commons on the subject and he gathered that the main deduction was that ifthe question was dealt with at all it must be doneby the Government.      The Bill, however, was a verydifficult one to draft. -After considerable discussion the cabinet agreed -(a) To approve generally the policy proposedby the Home Secretary in CP.  144 (34).(b) That in replying to questions in the Houseof Commons the Home Secretary, after statingthat the matter had been under considerationby the Government, should lay emphasis on the law and order aspects of the problem and the additional duties that are being placed on the police, rather than on theactual wearing of political uniforms,and should make clear that the government intend to maintain law and order and, if their present powers prove insufficient,will not hesitate to ask Parliament toincrease them.
COMMITTEE ON 8. The Cabinet had before them the following ministers&apos;POWERS. documents on the subject of Ministers&apos; Powers,Report of. consideration of which had been postponed, at theMeeting referred to in the margin:-A Memorandum by the Lord Chancellor(CP .-44 (35)), covering the Reportof   a   Committee (Cmd .4060).   TheLord Chancellor hoped that a CabinetCommittee would be appointed toconsider the Report and advise theCabinet on its recommendations:A Memorandum by the Minister of Health(C.P.-43 (S3)), to which was appendeda Note dealing with some of the moreimportant issues at stake.     TheMinister raised no objection tothe Lord Chancellor&apos;s proposal fora Cabinet Committee.The Cabinet agreed -That the Prime Minister,  if questionedagain in the House of Commons on the subject,should be authorised to state that theGovernment had repeatedly had the Reportof the Committee on Ministers&apos; Powers(Cmd. 4060) under consideration and didnot propose to pursue the subject as awhole.(previous reference:Cabinet 13(33), Con-c lus ion 3 .)
THE MERCHANDISEMARKS (TRADEDESCRIPTIONS)BILL.(previous reference:Cabinet 21(34), Con-elusion 8.)9,    In pursuance of the Conclusion mentioned inthe margin, when it had been agreed that the subject should be placed on the Agenda of the next Meeting,the Cabinet again had under consideration a Memorandumby the President of the Board of Trade (H.A.-30 (34))covering the draft Merchandise Marks (Trade Descrip-tions) Bill, which was designed to amend theMerchandise Marks Act, 1887, so as to enable orders in Council to be made assigning statutory meanings totrade terms in relation to any class or description of goods:    together with the following recommendationof the Committee of Home Affairs thereon (H..A.C. 10thConclusions (34), Minute 1):-&quot;To authorise the introduction forth-with in the House of Commons of theMerchandise Marks (Trade Descriptions)Bill in the form of the draft annexed to H.A.-30 (34), subject to any drafting or other minor alterations that, might be found necessary or desirable, on the understanding thatit might not be possible, owing tothe state of Parliamentary business,to proceed beyond the First ReadingStage of the Bill in the present Session&quot;.At the previous Meeting some doubts were expressed about this Bill, and it had been agreed that thePresident of the Board of Trade should consult theParliamentary Secretary to the Treasury about itsprospects in the House of Commons and report to thePrime Minister.The President of the Board of Trade statedthat his only object in introducing the Bill was inorder that the various interests concerned mighthave an opportunity of considering it.The Cabinet agreed -(a) To approve the recommendation of theCommittee of Home Affairs as set forth above subject to -(b) A question and answer to be arranged bythe President of the Board of Trade inwhich he should explain that the onlyobject in introducing the Bill was thatthe various interests concerned might havean opportunity of considering it and making representations.

[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government, and should bereturned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.]0)Ctode^and^C7pbe^telegT-am to Sir R. Lindsay, (Washington) foreign Office, 30th May, 1934, 5.50 p.m.No.141.-0-O-O-O-0-O-O-0-EBDIATEoFollowing is draft of Note to United. States Government.1.     In their Note of the 1st December, 1932, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment gave a fall statement of the reasons which convincedthem that,the existing system of inter-governmental war debtobligations had &quot;broken down.      They pointed out the difference&quot;between these war debt obligations and normal credit operations for development purposes:   they showed the economic impossibil-ity of making transfers on the scale required by these obligatiorand the disastrous effect which any further attempt to do so would have on trade and prices:   they emphasised the sacrificeswhich the British nation had made in this matter and theinjustice of the difference between their funding settlement andthose accorded to other debtors.     They concluded that a revision of the existing settlements was essential in theinterests of world revival and they urged that further payments should be postponed pending such a revision.     Nothing that has since occurred has led His Majesty1s Government to change theviews they then expressed.2m     That the present settlement imposes upon the peopleof this country a burden which is both unreasonable in itself and inequitable in relation to the treatment accorded to othercountries may be clearly seen from the following figures.In respect of war advances totalling $4,277,000,000,payments totalling $2,025,000,-000 have been made up to date byHis Majesty^ Government to the- United States Government.      Yetdespite
despite these payments, the nominal&apos; amount of the debt still outstanding as at the 15th June, 1954: amounts to$4,715,785,000.Meanwhile, in respect of v/ar advances totalling$5,572^500,000 made &quot;by the United States Government to other european Governments, the aggregate payments made up to dateamount to only $678,500,000o     Thus though the war advances to these other Governments exceed &quot;by one-quarter the advances made to the United Kingdom, the payments by the United Kingdomamount to three times what the United States Government hasreceived from those other Powers*On the other hand, His Majesty&apos;s Government are &quot;both aCreditor and a Debtor in regard to these inter-governmentalobligations. -   They themselves made war advances to the AlliedGovernments totalling $7,800,-000,-000:   &quot;but they have paid overall receipts obtained in respect of these loans, as well as in-respect of war reparations, to the United States Government-andhave paid nearly as much again out of their own resources,.Convinced that any resumption of payments on the pastscale could not hut intensify the world crisis and might provoke--..finanaial-and-economic- chaos, His Majesty1 s Government have-Suspended their claims on their debtors, in the hope that ageneral revision of these inter^governmentaX.;-obligations mightbe effected in the interests of world, recovery^     But it wouldhe impossible for them to contemplate a situation in which theywould he called upon to honour in full their war obligations to others while continuing to suspend all demands for thepayment of the war obligations due to theme5o     The improvement which has taken place in the budgetary situation of the United Kingdom in no way invalidatesthis conclusion..     This improvement is due entirely to theunprecedented sacrifices made by the people of this countrycSince
Since the war they have been carrying a burden of indebtednessamounting to approximately  8,O0CV00Q^0O or  170 per head of theirpopulation, about one-fifth of which represents the war loansmade to the Allied Governments.     vo balance their Budget, theyhave for the past fifteen years been paying taxation on a scalefor which ii would he hard to find a parallel elsewhere.    Burinthe discussions which took place last October, the british representatives pointed out that in 1929 (the last year for whic.statistics were available) the total burden of taxation in theUnited Kingdom in relation to national wealth was approximatelytwice as heavy as that in the United States, and this statement was not contested by the representatives of the United states treasury.     This taxation, amounting to close on one-quarter ofthe national income, has involved a prolonged period ofindustrial depression and the maintenance ever since the V/ar ofan army of unemployed.     Yet in order to restore the nationalcredit ah 1931, the people of this country accepted further and heavy increases in taxation, accompanied by rigorous control ofexpenditure and cuts in salaries and allowances of all kinds:and despite all these measures the Budget would have again showea deficit last year had it not been&apos; possible to secure, by the conversion operation carried through in 1932, a reduction in therate of interest paid on a large proportion of the public debt.This reduction has enabled His Majesty&apos;s Government to remit apart of the emergency sacrifices imposed in 1931 and to restorea part of the cuts on salaries, and the whole of the cut in umemployment allowances, the continuance of which was imposing a severe strain on the national conscience.     It would have beena gross act of social injustice to have denied this relief tothe people of this country in order to pay war debts to theUnited States while suspending the war debt payments due to theUnited Kingdom.
4-o     But, although it is desirable that the internal-budgetary position of this country should not be misunderstood^it is really irrelevant to the question of intergovernmentaldebt, the payment of which has to be related to the balance oftrade and not to the volume of internal revenue0     The revenues of this country are sterling revenues, whereas the debt payments to America have to be made in dollars or in goldr,     In order tosecure the means of payment, therefore, any sums available in sterling would have to be transferred across the exchangee     Thaattempt to transfer amounts of this magnitude would, as their immediate effect, cause a sharp depreciation of sterling againstthe dollar which, as His Majesty1s Government understand, wouldnot be consistent with the monetary policy of the United StatesGovernment.     And in the long run such international transferswould be impossible without a radical alteration in the economic policies of the United States of Americao     Payment of debtsimplies the willingness of the creditor to accept goods and services sufficient to cover the debts due to him, over and abovethe goods and services required to cover his exports:   and to makeit possible for the United States to receive payment of their claims, it would be necessary to effect a complete reversal ofthe existing favourable balance of trade between their countryand the rest of the world.     In the case of the United Kingdomthe balance of trade is heavily unfavourable and the balance of accounts is not such that His Majesty&apos;s Government could con-template the transfer of any substantial sum across the exchangeunless it was compensated by equivalent receipts from theforeign debtors of this country,,     If this were done, sterling would not be affected by the payments to America but the burden would
5 ewould he thrown on the currencies of the European debtoicsmntrj/es; therehy aggravating the present crisis which it isttm object both of the United States and of His Majesty^sGovernment to alleviate,,. 5s     Thus the question of the British War Debt is only par?,of the wider question of the inter-governmental obligationsresulting from the World War.    As has already been pointed out,,the United Kingdom while it was a debtor to the United Statesof America was itself a creditor for larger amounts from FranceyItaly and other ex-Allied Powers in respect of war debts5 andthese in turn are co-creditors with the United Kingdom of germany in respect of reparations^.     These inter-governmental debtsf as stated in the British Note of 1st December,, 1932, are radically -different from the Commercial loans raised by foreign Govern-ments on the markets for productive purposes0   War debts are neither productive nor self-liquidating and the unnaturaltransfers required for their payment would involve a generalcollapse of normal international exchange and credit operations *The Administration of the United States under President Hooverrecognised this fact and initiated the moratorium on intersgovernmental payments in 1931 in order to avert an immediatecollapse.,     But the moratorium of 1931 caused another change inthe situation^     it made any resumption of the pre-existingreparation and War debt settlements impossible, and the revisionof reparations embodied in the Lausanne Agreement was made subject to the conclusion of a subsequent Agreement for the revision of War Debtso6.     It was with these facts in mind that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment approached the United States Government in December1932 and the United States Government in their Note of the 7th.    ,December welcomed their suggestion for a close examination&quot;be twee 7i
between the two countries of the whole subject.      After thisexchange of notes His Majesty&apos;s Government paid the instalmentdue on the 1st December, 1952, in gold, explaining that thispayment was not to be regarded as a resumption of the annual payments contemplated by the existing Agreement and that it wasmade because there had not been time for the discussion withregard to that Agreement to take place and because the UnitedStates Government had stated that in their opinion such a pay-ment would greatly increase the prospects of a satisfactoryapproach to the whole problem.     In accordance with the arrange-nent then made, discussions took place, first, in the spring,and later in the autumn, of last year between representatives ofthe two countries and His Majesty1s Government appreciate thesympathetic manner in which their representatives were listenedto.    But on both ocoasions it was found impossible to arriveat a settlement acceptable to the two Governments in the face of the unprecedented state of world economic and financial conditions.     Accordingly the discussions were adjourned and on june 15th and December 15th, 1953, His Majesty&apos;s government made token payments in acknowledgement of its debt, and thePresident expressed the personal view that he would not regardHis Majesty1s Government as in default.7.     In their Note of the 6th November last His Majesty&apos;sGovernment expressed their readiness to resume negotiations onthe general question whenever after eonsultation with thePresident it might appear that this could usefully be done.Unfortunately recent events have shown that discussions on thewhole question with a view to a final settlement cannot atpresent usefully be renewed.     In these circumstances his majesty&apos;s Government would have been quite prepared to make afurther
7ofurther payment on the 15th June next in acknowledgement ofthe Debt and without prejudice to their right again to presentthe case for its readjustment, on the assumption that they would again have received the Presidents declaration that he would notconsider them in defaults     They understand, hov/ever, that inconsequence of recent legislation no such declaration would now he possible and if this be the case, the procedure adopted by common agreement in 1953 is no longer practicable;.End of &quot;R&quot;88o    His Majesty5s Government are in fact faced with a choice between only two alternatives, viz:   to pay in full thesum of $262s000,000 as set forth in the communication from theUnited States^ Treasury, dated 25th May5 or to suspend allinterim payments pending the final revision of the settlement which has been delayed by events beyond the control of the twoGovernments,.    Deeply as they regret the circumstances whichhave forced them to take such a decision. His majesty&apos;s Govern-ment feel that they could not assume the responsibility of adopting a course which would revive the whole system of inter-Governmental War Debts paymentsa      As already pointed out the resumption of full payments to the United States of america would necessitate a corresponding demand by His Majesty&apos;1&apos;s Govern-ment from their own War D eh tors *     It would recreate the con-ditions which existed prior to the world crisis and were in large measure, responsible for it.     Such a procedure would throwa bombshell into the European arena which would have financialand economic repercussions over all the five continents andwould postpone indefinitely the chances of world recovery..
8;9o     Accordingly His Majesty&apos;s Government are reluctantlycompelled to take the only other course open to theme     Butthey wish to reiterate that while suspending further paymentsuntil it becomes possible to discuss the ultimate settlementof inter-Governmental War Debts with a reasonable prospect ofagreement, then have no intention of repudiating their obligations and will be prepared to enter upon further discussionof the subject at any time when in the opinion of the President-such discussion would be likely to produce results of value.
