The Lord President of the Council informed the Cabinet that arrangements had been made for theHouse of Commons to re-assemble on Tuesday, October30th, but the usual powers were being taken to summonit earlier in case of necessity.   The present inten-tion was that Parliament should be prorogued, onNovember 16th and. that the new Session should openon November 20th.    It was possible, however, that both these dates might have to be postponed for aweek.piNBTloGEDURE.previous reference:Satinet 13J34), Con-Blus ion 1.)2. In connection with the previous conclusion the Lord President of the Council announced that aMeeting of the Cabinet would be held, at a date to bedecided, later, in the week beginning September 23rd,though he would not press for members to attend thisMeeting who had to come from a great distance and towhom, it would be Inconvenient to attend.Et Wednesday, September 26th, wasinconvenient to some members, as thenew Cunarder was to be launched atGlasgow on that date.)The Lord President asked, however, that his colleagues should be ready for regular work, including the weekly Meetings of the Cabinet, from October 1stonwards .   There would be a number of important-subjects to be dealt with, including the question ofDistressed Areas,At the end of the Cabinet the Lord Presidentasked that the chief Bills of the next Session ofParliament might be ready as early as convenient,-in order that as many Second.

L BOLIVIA-Is Arms&apos; naf.eo.Previousfeeferene e:fabinet 21134), Con-ihis ion 3.)/:/?.3, The CaM.net had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs fO,P.-196(34)) on the subject, of the Bolivia-Paraguay arms embargo.   The Secretary of State recalled that on june 4th it had been announced in the House ofCommons that we were pressing at Geneva that theinternational embargo, which we had suggested, should.be imposed at once unconditionally by all countries,and that in the meantime we were holding up licences.The United States, Switzerland and Denmark had takensimilar action.    Italy, on the other hand, had madeher acceptance conditional on acceptance by JTapany cuuLJapan, however, had declined to&quot;co-operate in whatshe regarded as a League of Nations matter.Unsuccessful efforts had been made to induce theItalians to change their attitude, and representationsat Tokyo had also failed.   These representations were now being renewed, and France and the United states were being pressed to take similar action at Rome.The question for dec is ion was as to what should bedone in the event of the failure of these representa-tions,   The Secretary of State suggested that astatement should be made in Parliament dealing franklywith the facts, recording our new representations toItaly and our invitation to France and the UnitedStates, but adding that It was impossible to exposeour manufacturers to prejudice when most foreign rivalswere free to accept orders, and that we therefore gavepublic notice that we should have to abandon our effort and renew the granting of licences very shortly unlessgeneral agreement was reached.   His idea would be toset a time limit, such as the Meeting of the league council in September, with some saving provision inthe event of matters getting worse in the interval.-3-
The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reportedthat since his Memorandum had been circulated thedifficulty had been cleared up.   The Italian Government,which had. presented the main difficulty, had changedits view and had undertaken to enact the necessary measures to prevent the export from Italian territory of war material destined for Bolivia and. Paraguay, andhad stated that such measures would contain no exceptionin favour of current contracts.   In these circumstances the other objectors were collapsing, and there was every reason to believe that we could carry our policy and.make it effective.   Meanwhile he proposed to watch thesituation carefully and, if there was any evasion of the embargo, to see that our interests were not prejudiced.For the moment he asked approval of the communicationhe had. made on the 23rd July to the Secretary-Generalof the League of Nations, urging that a telegram shouldbe despatched, to all the Governments concerned, informing them of the foregoing facts and enquiring whether theywere now willing to put the embargo into force without.reservations without delay and, if possible, before theend. of the month.The President of the Board, of Trade pointed outthat the telegram to the Secretary-General stated thatHis Majesty*s Government &quot;formally accept the embargoproposal and will immediately enforce a complete suspension-sion of all exports of arms and war material,- including any consignments for which licences have been Issued.before May 9th, the date.....on which the issue of newlicences was, suspended&quot;.   Two licences had been issued,one to. Messrs Vickers of  1,900, and one to imperial chemical Industries of  16,500 outstanding value, whichhad. been issued before May 9th.   The telegram to theSecretary-General had. been sent without consultation
with the Board of Trade, and in all the circumstances it would be very awkward to cancel these two licences,which had. been issued with the concurrence of theForeign Office.A good deal of discussion took place on thesubject of these two licences.   There was generalagreement that the Government certainly had the right in law to cancel licences, particularly in cases suchas a war emergency, where it was contrary to thenational interest to allow the licence to continue,but that to cancel it. without warning, on groundssuch as those existing in the present case, would bevery hard on the firms concerned.   The firms affectedmight ask for compensation.   Probably they could notdemand, it as a matter of law, but in the circumstancesof the case the payment of some compensation might bea moral obligation.The question, however, was recognised, to depend to some extent on the form of the licences and thenature of the orderst    e.g.   whether they were genuine!new contracts, and. the matter was decided as In0onelus ion (c ) be 1 ow .In the course of the discussion the First lord ofthe Admiralty pointed out that we had imposed a uni-lateral embargo which, if he was correctly informed,had. inflicted on our industry a loss of orders to thevalue of  55,000 which had gone elsewhere.   He asked that there might be some agreement that in futureembargoes should, not be imposed before other nations had agreed to take the same action as ourselves fromthe same day.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was unable to agree that the Foreign Office should exerciseno &quot;future check on licences.    In the present case their action, had. been public and known to other Government
Departments.   He agreed, however, to a proposal ofthe Chancellor of the Exchequer that in future casesthe Foreign Office should consider their decision in the light of what had happened on the presentoccas ion.The question was also raised as to whether Americanaction was likely to prove effective.   The americans had been unable, for Treaty reasons, to impose an embargo on &quot;shipments&quot;, and the United States embargowas limited to &quot;sales&quot;.    There appeared nothing toprevent orders being given in America by some thirdnation, which would then transfer the arms and ammu.nl-tion to one of the two belligerents.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat, he also had raised the same point.    It was, ofcourse, possible that the same thing might happen here.Some nation other than a belligerent might buy thegoods and re-sell them, after exportation, to Boliviaor Paraguay.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve generally the telegram sent by the Secretary of&quot; State for ForeignAffairs on the 23rd. July, 1934, to the secretary-General of the League o^ Nations,asking him to despatch a telegram to allthe Governments which had received theleague*s Circular letter of 14th Juneenquiring whether they were now willingto put the embargo into.force withoutreservations without delay and, ifpossible, before the end - of the present month:(b) That the President of the Board of trade should instruct his Department at once to get into touch, with the firms concernedin the two licences issued, before 9th May,and should ascertain all the facts concern-ing the orders and the exact position:(c) That the question of&apos;suspending these twolicences should be considered by theSecretary of State for Foreign affairs and the President of the Board of Trade,who should consult the Chancellor of theExchequer if any question of compensation was involved:
(d) &quot;hat on any -future occasion when thequestion of an embargo on the export-at ion of war material, might be raised the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should consider the matter inthe light of what had happened on thepresent occasion.

Mayors&apos; Association ofLondon asking for instructions in the matter of air raids Precautions .The suggestion was made that this letter might be useful to the Lord President if he proposed to make astatement In the House of Commons, but possiblepolitical objections were pointed out.The Postmaster-General suggested that if anannouncement were made it should not be left to stand,by itself.   ^he minds of the public required to be approached gradually on this question.   The statementmight be followed up, for example, by a broadcast,The Cabinet asreed  (a) That in the eoxrrsehis si in the debate on Air Defence Policy on Monday next, July 30th, the Lord President ofthe Council should make a statement onthe subject of Air Raids Precautions:(b) &quot;hat the Home Secretary should considerthe desirability of following up thestatement by a broadcast,

Kingdom Governmentwhile they would merely make contribu-tions to the United Kingdom exchequer for the cost of mail services, it was essential that the scheme outlined in cp.-190 (34) should be presented tothe Dominions not as- the only   possibleone, but as the one which, from theUnited Kingdom point of view, wouldseem the most efficient and economical,and that our negotiators should havea wide latitude in conducting thediscussions with the Dominions:A Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Air (CP,-204 (34)), commenting onthe speed of the new aircraft by whichthe services would be operated underthe scheme, and Informing the cabinet of the delicate and difficult situation arising out of the obstructive attitudeof the French authorities,   He was apprehensive that if a public announce-ment were made of the present schemeFrench jealousy might be still furtheraroused and their attitude harden.In the circumstances he asked theadvice of his colleagues on the besttactics to pursue.In the course of the discussion the Chancellorof the Exchequer demurred to the proposal in para-graph 6 of the Report that, in the event of theDominions, India and the Colonies not being preparedto contribute on the scale proposed, the UnitedKingdom Exchequer should make good any deficiency,....

The Cabinet had. before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs (C.P.-199(34)) entitled &quot;mhe Economic Situation and Inter-Imperial Relations&quot;, urging in particular that theGovernment should have a clearer idea than at present of the extent to which it was proposed, to develop thevarious branches of agriculture in this country.Recent discussions with the Dominion High Commissionershad confirmed him in this view, and he felt that a survey of the -whole position on a still wider basiswas very desirable.   &quot;The Government were faced withthe need for reconciling and adjusting a whole seriesof interests, and he therefore suggested that, as a first step, representatives of the various Departmentsconcerned, should be instructed, to make a preliminarysurvey during the Recess of the various aspects ofthe problem. .The Cabinet were informed that the Prime minister had already established, a Committee of the economic advisory Council, presided over by Sir Josiah Stamp,to enquire into the questions referred to in the-Memorandum by the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the President of the Board, of trade should ask Sir Josiah Stamp, if possibleto present the Report of the Committeeof the Economic Advisory Council by theend. of September:(b) That an inter-Departmental Committee,composed as followsSir Frederick Leith-Ross (In the Chair),Sir Horace Wilson,A Representative of the Dominions Office,The Permanent Secretary to the Ministry ofAgriculture and.

(c) That the Minister of Agricultureand.

Gandhi7.      The Secretary of State for India recalled that twelve months ago Mr. Gandhi had been sentenced to twelve months civil imprisonment for civilevious&quot;erence: disobedience.      His sentence would expire in August.cabinet 17 (34)conclusion 6).       After a hunger strike Mr. Gandhi had been releasedbut said that during the term of his sentence hewould not commit any new offence.      There were signs that on the expiration of his sentence in Augusthe would do so and if he were to break the law hewould have to be convicted and sentenced under theLaw.      Probably, however, he would give I-en-g* noticeof what he intended to do.      In that event, thequestion arose as to whether the Government oughtto take any precautionary steps.      Their object would be to prevent Mr. Gandhi from becoming a martyrand recovering his popularity while placing noobstacles in the way of his campaign in favour of theUntouchables.      The Government of India&apos;s view wasthat they should at once issue a restriction orderimposing certain restrictive conditions from the start.      The Secretary of State and his advisers,however, and the Government of Bombay, who were mainly concerned, thought that Mr. Gandhi would atonce break any such restrictions thus compellingthe Government to take action.      He would thenprobably starve himself to death.     An alternative proposal which was preferred both in the India Officeand in Bombay was to intern Mr. Gandhi in a house in such a way as to give him considerable latitudesubject to his remaining in a particular district.In that event he might not adopt a hunger strike andwould be free to continue his work on behalf of theUntouchables.      By adopting that method conviction ina Court of Justice would be avoided, whereas if theother course were adopted and he went to prison all
sorts of difficulties at once arose in connectionwith such matters as what visitors he should beallowed to see and the gatherings of interested peoplearound the prison and so forth.The Cabinet agreed -That the Secretary of State for India shouldhave authority to arrange for the internmentof Mr. Gandhi in a house in preference toany restrictive conditions which might resultin his being convicted in a Court of Law andimprisoned.

He assumed that the Foreign office would send the Notice to His Majesty&apos;s representativesabroad and that steps would be taken to informmembers of the Diplomatic Corps in London of HisMajesty&apos;s decision - see below Conclusion (e).The President of the Board of Education asked that he might be consulted in any further considerationof the question of the proposed children&apos;s fete.The Home Secretary said that,if the cabinet approved the arrangements, he proposed to informthe ecclesiastical authorities in confidence of thedecision to hold a thanksgiving service in St. Paul&apos; cathedral.      This confidential information would begiven in advance of the publication of the Press Notice.The Home Secretary mentioned that he had-22-15.    The Home Secretary reported, that the King,while agreeahle in principle to the general outline of the programme prepared for the twenty-fifthanniversary of His Majesty&apos;s accession, was disinclinedto approve either the river progress or the drive throughnorthern London to Wembley to a children&apos;s fete in theStadium, though willing that these two items should heexamined in further detail.

received, a proposal from a colleague that one of the    ^Nonconformist ministers present at St. Paul&apos;s might be asked to read one of the lessons.      In a discussion on this proposal it was mentioned that there were agood many precedents for Nonconformist ministerstaking part and even preaching at services in church of England Cathedrals, hut certain difficulties werepointed out to the adoption of the proposal at a Statethanksgiving.      The question was recognised to require futher exploration and no decision was taken.The Cabinet were informed that the list ofNonconformist bodies included among the privilegedbodies was completely out of date.      It was suggestedthat the chief Nonconformist bodies might come to-gether on some appropriate occasion and make ajoint address to the King.        It was stated that alarge proportion of His Majesty&apos;s subjects are membersof Nonconformist bodies, and that some special provision shouldbe made for them.      No decision wastaken on this point which was felt to require further exploration.The Secretary of State for India reported thatthe position as regards representation of India was rather indefinite.        He did not yet know what kind of assembly would be elected.     As regards the Princes,he was working on the line that one or two should behere officially but that for the rest the celebrationshould take place in their respective States.Some discussion took place on a proposal thatthe more important legislatures of the Empire should beinvited to send two representatives apiece and theless important legislatures one representative apieceto the celebration.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said thatthe first proposal had been that invitations should besent to these parliamentary representatives and that
they and their wives should &quot;be the guests of HisMajesty&apos;s Government.      It had been pointed out, however,that this would be out of proportion to the scale onwhich the Silver Jubilee was being organised.      Therepresentatives of the Empire Parliamentary association had then pointed out that the Association in theordinary course wished to invite parliamentaryrepresentatives of the Dominions to London in thecoming   year.      Such an invitation was long overdue.The present suggest j. on was that since the delegates.would be here for the meeting of the Empire ParliamentaryAssociation a month or so before the Jubilee celebrations,they should be invited to take part in any functions to which members of Parliament were invited.      Thisproposal, however,  raised the question of payment.The Empire Parliamentary Association reported that inother parts of the Empire the expenses of delegates aswell as their transport had been paid for by theGovernments that were the hosts.      To make such paymentshere would raise a new precedent.      One suggestion wasthat the Empire Parliamentary association might raise a fund to which the Exchequer might make a contribution.The Cabinet were informed that the King&apos;s silver jubilee was also the Silver Jubilee of the EmpireParliamentary Association.      Mr. Amery had estimated thecost of his proposals to the Government as  10,000, butthis was thought to be totally inadequate.The Secretary of State for India pointed outthat the proposal would open the flood-gates so far as india was concerned, and once the door was openedto official guests on any considerable scale, it would bedifficult to resist the pressure of Indian Princes tocome in large numbers.
The Cabinet agreed -(a) That the question of entertaining therepresentatives of the Empire ParliamentaryAssociation should be considered by a committee composed as follows -The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Home Secretary,The Secretary of State forDominion Affairs,The Secretary of State for theColonies,The Secretary of State for India.(b) That instead of issuing a Press Communiqueas proposed, an announcement on the linesof the draft Press Notice attached to cp.  168 (34)   (as amended)  should b e madeby the Lord President of the Council in theHouse of Commons on the afternoon of Monday,July 30th.(c) That the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs should make arrangements for publica-tion in the Parliaments (or otherwise)in the Dominions as near as possiblesimultaneously with the announcement here,and that the Secretary of State for theColonies should make corresponding arrangements.(d) That arrangements should be made between theHome Secretary and the Postmaster-General to broadcast the announcement.(e) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should make an appropriate communica-tion to His Majesty&apos;s representatives abroad and to members of the Diplomatic Corps inLondon of His Majesty&apos;s decision that noforeign missions of any xind are to be invitedto participate in the celebrations, and of the&apos;suggestion that the representation of foreigncountries at the ceremonies should be confined to the diplomatic representatives in london of those countries.Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.I.,25th July, 1934.
