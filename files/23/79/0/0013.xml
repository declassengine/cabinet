1, The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (C.P.-188(34)) summarising the main results of discussions withM. Barthou, the French Foreign Minister, at the ForeignOffice on July 9th and 10th, on a proposal for an Eastern Locarno Pact.   The question for the Cabinetnow was whether they would approve proceeding on thelines of the provisional agreement attached as an annex to the Memorandum, which was as follows:-&quot;On the clear understanding that theydo not intend as far as they are concerned to assume any new commitments in the matterof regional pacts. His Majesty*s Government-would be prepared to recommend the schemefor an Eastern Mutual Guarantee Pact tothe German, Polish and Italian Governments,provided, that they are authorised to informthese Governments as follows:-(l) In the view of the French GovernmentRussia ought, to be prepared to give to Germany as well as to France thesame guarantees against non-provokedaggression as those which she wouldbe bound, to give if she were asignatory of the Treaty of Locarno&apos;:(S) In regard to the proposed EasternPact France would be prepared togive the same guarantees to both germany and Russia.(3) The French Government agree with His&apos;Ma,jestyfs Government in holding thatthe conclusion of such a Pact andGermany&apos;s participation in the systemof reciprocal guarantees now contem-plated would afford the best ground for the resumption of negotiationsfor the conclusion of a conventionsuch as would provide for a reasonableapplication of the principle of- Germanequality of rights in a regime of security for all nations*wAs his Memorandum had necessarily been circulatedto members of the Cabinet at rather short notice, theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs made a statementexplaining the course of events as set forth therein.In the course of this statement he mentioned that a debate on Foreign Policy was to take place in theHouse of Commons on Friday, July 13th^ when he wouldhave to make a statement on these conversations.
The Lord President of the Council expressed theview that the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs had shown great skill in these negotiations.   Theresult was more satisfactory than that of any recentconversations with the French Government.   He supported the proposal.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, inreply to a request for information as to how much hewould propose to announce in the forthcoming Debate inthe House of Commons, said that he contemplateddescribing in general terras M. Barthou&apos;s original proposal and explaining the difficulties which HisMajesty&apos;s Government had felt in accepting it in itsoriginal form of a Franco-Russian Guarantee providingno corresponding assurances to Germany if Germany was attacked by France or Russia, as the case might be.He would continue that in the new form of a Treaty ofthe Locarno type, His Majesty&apos;s Government thoughtthat it would contribute to peace and. stability inEurope.   He would explain that M. Barthou had beeninformed that this was our view and that we had thoughtit right to notify our view to certain other nationsconcerned, and to make clear that the proposal had. our good will.   He proposed also, subject to the agreementof the French Government, to announce in general terms the third paragraph of the agreement and. to point outthat this was an attempt to make a start in opening up Disarmament negotiations with Germany once more.Before making a statement on these lines, however,the Secretary of State proposed to inform the FrenchGovernment of the general line he intended to take.In the course of a short discussion, very general satisfaction was displayed at the result of these conversations.   While the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs was not too sanguine   of its leading-2-
to the desired results at any early date,  owing tosuch factors as the attitude of Poland and. Germanyand the objections the latter might entertain to theinclusion of the Baltic States, some of his colleaguestook the view that at any rate it gave the GermanGovernment an opportunity of which they might beglad to avail themselves in their present difficultiesThe Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the provisional Agreementattached to C.P.-188 (34) and repro-reproduced at the head of this Conclusion:(b) To authorise the- Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs to take immediate action to recommend the scheme for an Eastern Mutual Guarantee Pact to theGerman, Polish and Italian Governments:(c) To approve the general line which the&apos;  Secretary of State for Foreign affairs proposed to take in the forthcoming debate in the House of Commons ohFriday, July 13th, and to leave to his discretion both the previous commuhlca-tion to the French Government and theconduct of the Debate.(NOTE: As regards a reference to bemade to Belgium in the statement by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs&quot;, see Conclusion 2.)
&apos;JSuaees tedKeeiaratlon-Warding.(previous reference:Cabinet 27(34), Con-cIns ion 4.)3. The Cabinet had before them the following documents on the subject of a suggested declaration on Belgian Independence:-A Report by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs, submitted inaccordance with Cabinet 25 (34),Conclusion 4, and the Minutes of aMeeting held on June 29th, 19 34(CP.-174 (34)) :A Report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee on the Strategical implications-tions of a Declaration concerningBelgian Security (C.P.-175 (34))submitted in accordance with Cabinet26 (34) Conclusion 4 (b) and circulatedby direction of the Lord President ofthe Council for consideration inconnection with CP.-174 (34):The record of a Conversation betweenthe Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs and the German ambassador on July 3, 1934 (C.P.-177 (34)).The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Invited.the attention of the Cabinet to paragraph 10 of cp.-188 (34) (under consideration in connectionwith Item T of these Conclusions) where it was pointed.out that Belgium was not mentioned in the arrangementsfor an Eastern Mutual Guarantee Pact which had been-discussed with M, Barthoti on the previous day.M, Barthou had opposed the inclusion of that country on the ground, that Belgium could not in any circumstances-stances lend effective aid in respect of the Easternfrontiers of Germany and that the plan was based onour own principle of mutuality.   The omission ofBelgium was certain to be noted, if not in the debate in the House of Commons, at any rate by the BelgianGovernment.   He had come to the conclusion that for anumber of reasons the time was not opportune for making any Important statement on our willingness todefend Belgian integrity in case of need.   He thought,however, that in the course of his statement in theHouse of Commons he might explain incidentally thereasons why Belgium had not been included, adding that this was a small country in which the United
Kingdom had a great Interest since its integrity was of vital importance to us.The Lord. President of the Council said that, aftermuch thought, he had come to the conclusion that therewere considerable objections to any ex. cathedrastatement being made on the subject of Belgiansecurity at the present time.   Any Declaration on thesubject must lead, by the logic of facts, to a tripartite Alliance with Prance, which would be very dangerous.   It might be that in the event of war weshould be forced into that position, but it would, notbe prudent to announce it at the present time..   some people held the view that Germany would, like to picka quarrel with this country and attack us withoutbringing Prance into the struggle.    If we were tomake a Declaration to Belgium to which Prance wasnot a party, these people would say that it gaveGermany the opportunity to carry out this design.In his view our policy should be pursued gradually.Before the end of the present Session he anticipatedthat the Government would be announcing a considerableAir Programme, and. it was impossible to conceal thatwe were also considering a rectification of the deficiencies of the other Defence Services.    If, on top of that statement4 we were to make a formalDeclaration of our intention to use force, ifnecessary, for the preservation of Belgian independ-ence, the political effect might very well be veryserious .   He agreed, however, with the proposal ofthe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to include some incidental reference to Belgium on the lines hehad suggested.The Secretary of State for India had reached thesame conclusion, but on different grounds. But forthe events of the last few weeks he himself would have-5-
supported a Declaration being made on our attitudetowards Belgium.   Now, however, there were two new factors:    first, the recent sinister events in Germany,which indicated a weakening of the present regime&apos;and, second, the successful result of the conversa-tions with M. Barthou.   It would be, a contradictionin terms, just after we had insisted on Prance droppingher plans for uni-lateral or bi-lateral measures t-e-g-sa train feeaaaaa^ to announce a/policy -of- giv-ing-gj*4-^eh-aid - to-Belgi-um.   He agreed, !wwe^, with theForeign Secretary&apos;s proposal to work into his statement on the Barthou conversations a reference to Belgium.The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed generally with the Secretary of State for India.   One of thereasons why he had supported a Declaration of our policy towards Belgium had been the need for instructingptiblie opinion on the situation.   Another reason hadbeen to give a warning to Germany.   He agreed, however,that Germany showed symptoms of weakness and was unlikely to embark on aggressive action in the nearfuture.   Consequently the need for an immediatedeterrent was rather less, and it would be inappropriateto make a resounding Declaration.   Nevertheless, theneed for educating public opinion remained, and hewould therefore like the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs to mention that Belgian integrity was vital .to this country,   whatever was said now, he thought the Cabinet might before long have to consider holdingconversations with the Belgian and. possibly the french governments on this matter, for, as the Chiefs of staff committee had remarked, whether we made a Declarationor not, the commitment existedwThe Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs saidthat the Prime Minister had been rather disturbed atthe proposed Declaration to Belgium, and had been much
reassured on learning from him on the telephone that morning that the tendency was now rather against any major Declaration.   He himself agreed with theSecretary of State for India,The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs mentioned at the end of this discussion thatM. Jaspar, the new Belgian Foreign Minister, wishedto come to London to see him.    He, however, hadrefuoed, as he felt that for M. Jaspar to come so.soon after M. Hymans would, attract undue attention.(a) That, for reasons given in the courseof the discussion summarised above,the time was inopportune for a resoundingDeclaration of our concern in the integrity of Belgian territory on thelines approved in principle by theCabinet on June 87th (Cabinet 86 (34),Conclusion 4) ;(b) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, in making his statement inParliament on his conversations withM. Barthou, should be authorised to mention why Belgium had been left outof the French proposals for an EasternLocarno, adding incidentally some wordsto the effect, that this was a smallcountry in which the United kingdom had. a great interest and whose integritywas of vital importance to us:(c) To approve the action of the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs in avoiding a vis it t o London by M. Jas par at thepresent time.
3. The Lord President of the Council informed the Cabinet that the Ministerial Committee on disarmament had been working hard for some time on the Report of the Defence Requirements Committee,At the end of the previous week they had delegatedsome of the work to a small Sub-Committee, whichhad devoted six hours to the formulation of pro-posals ,    These were now ready for consideration.He proposed, therefore, that the ministerial committee should meet again on the following day.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Ministerial Committee on disarmament should meet at 10 downing street at 11 a,m. on Thursday, July12th, to consider the Report of itsSub-Committ ee on Air Defenc e proposaIs:(b) That the Meeting of the Sub-Committeeof the Committee of Imperial defence which had been arranged for the same day and hour should, be postponed toa more convenient hour or date.
! a RAIDSI^AUTIONS.publicity.LeviousLf reference e:lafcinet 11(34), Con-aegis ion 1.74, The Cabinet had. before them the following documents on the subject of the Importance of air raids Precautions :*-A Memorandum by the Chiefs of StaffSub-Committee, together with an extract from the Draft Minutes ofthe 265th Meeting of the Committeeof Imperial Defence, circulated forthe consideration of the Cabinet by direction of the Lord. President ofthe Council (CP.-179 (34)):A Note by the Home Secretary (CP.-180(34)), circulating for the considera-tion of the Cabinet a Report submittedby the Air Raids Precautions (Organisa-tion) Sub-Committee dealing withthequestion of Publicity on mattersappertaining to passive Air Defence.The Cabinet discussed the question under two main headings:-    (l) whether it was desirable that publicopinion should be educated to the danger of air bombing attacks in general, and chemical warfare in particular:and (2) if this was agreed, what would be the best method, of pursuing the matter.Some doubts were expressed as to the&apos;politicalexpediency of making an announcement at the presenttime, and it was suggested that if, at the very moment when we were announcing an increase in the Air Force,thepublic were asked to take precautions against air raids, an unnecessarily alarmist view of the inter-national situation would be created.   From this pointof view it was suggested that if it was necessary toInform the public it would be better to entrust theduty in the first Instance to well-informed private individuals rather than to Government representatives.Strong reasons, however, were given in favour offurther publicity at an early date.   Without greaterpublicity the Government*s plans could not be advancedmuch further, since a stage had. been reached when it-was necessary to take the matter up with LocalAuthorities on a considerable scale.   Unless there
was further publicity the public would remain inignorance of these risks and of the precautionswhich they could take to alleviate them.    If ever thedanger matured there would be the gravest danger ofpanic in an uninstructed civilian population.   Foreignna t x one had realised this, and throughout theContinent of Europe public opinion was being educatedby means of instructions, air raids tests, and so forth.The Government was already being criticised for itsapparent apathy on this question, and the subject hadalready been debated in the House of Lords.   A question was being asked on the matter in the House of commons the same afternoon.   It was strongly urged, therefore,that an early statement should be made, either by theLord President of the Council or the Home Secretary.The desirability was also suggested of broadcastannouncements.    It was pointed out that public opinion was already considerably concerned in this question,and that if an announcement was not made by theGovernment in the near future they were liable to bestampeded, by a newspaper campaign.In the course of the discussion the Secretary ofState for War read a Resolution passed by the ChemicalDefence Committee, a highly expert body composed of civilian specialists, which met in the War Office at intervals to consider questions of chemical warfare,and which urged the taking of proper precautions andthe education of the public.The Lord President of the Council thought that itwould fall, upon him to make a statement before longabout our Air Defence Policy, which was likely to befollowed by a day&apos;s Debate before the House of Commonsrose.   That would be a very important Debate and would afford an opportunity for a statement to be made on
the risks to the civilian population, in the courseof which it could be explained what was being doneabroad and what it was desired, to do in this country.The responsibility of the Government to take precautionsfor the preservation of life and property against this possible risk might be emphasised.    Re invited hiscolleagues to think over this proposal, and instructed the Secretary to place the subject on the Agenda paper for the. next weekly Meeting of the Cabinet,^he Cabinet agreed  (a) To postpone further consideration ofthe question of greater publicity on air Raids Precautions until the nextweekly Meeting of the Cabinet:(b) That the Home Secretary, in reply toa Question on the subject down for thesame afternoon, should state that hewas not in a position to add. anything to the statement by the Lord Presidentof the Council on March 21st.
CIVILAVIATION.I Control ofI PrivateI Plying, etc .f Report ofI Committee.I (previous reference:Cabinet 48I  (55), Con-1 elusion 8.)5.    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Air (CP.-178 (34)) brieflyoutlining the major featxires of the Report of a Committeshe had appointed last summer on the Control of PrivatePlying and other Aviation Questions, which he would shortly be presenting to Parliament, and his own proposals in regard to them.The Secretary of State for Air drew the attentionof the Cabinet particularly to the proposal to entrust the control of airworthiness of civil aircraft tothe Joint Aviation Advisory Committee of Lloyd&apos;sRegister and the British Corporation Registerreconstituted as a statutory autonomous and executive authority and renamed &quot;The Air Registration Board&quot;.In approving this the Air Ministry intended toretain, for the present at all events, control overthe larger passenger-carrying aircraft at least inso far as concerned the issue of &quot;type&quot; certificates of airworthiness.This proposal would require legislationbut not before the recess.       He intended to presenta Report to Parliament shortly and at the same timeto announce the decisions of the Air Ministry thereon.The Cabinet approved the proposals of theSecretary of State for Air as set forth in cp, 178 (34).
JAPANESETRADE COM-PETITION.repositionof TextileQuotas in ceylon.(previous reference:Cabinet 27(34), Con-clusion 7.) *. ^6.     The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for the Colonies (C.P.-184(34)) In continuation of his previous Paper on thesubject of &quot;Japanese Competition - Imposition of textile Quotas in Ceylon&quot;(C.P.-172 (34)), circulatingfor the information of his colleagues a copy offurther telegraphic correspondence with the governor of Ceylon.The Secretary of State for the colonies reported that the Ministers concerned had all agreed that the proposed offer must be made to ministers in Ceylon.        The offer had now been made and he hoped to have an answer before the discussion on the Colonial Office Vote on the following afternoon.The Cabinet took note of this statement.-13-
mjrg MEATProposedEmergencyLegislation.(previous reference:Cabinet 25(34), Con-olxxsion 6.)n.7.      The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Lord President of the Council, as Chairman of&apos;the Produce Markets Supply Committee (CP.-182 (34))on the subject of the Meat Situation, in which he pointed out that if action was to be taken to relieve the serious position of the United. Kingdom beefproducer any legislation which might be necessarymust be introduced forthwith.   While, therefore, thenegotiations with the Dominions and. the Argentinewere being conducted as rapidly as possible, the produce Markets Supply Committee had. thought itnecessary to press forward with, the examination of measures which, could, be brought into operation during september next, whether the negotiations were thenconcluded or not.   They had therefore come unanimouslyto the conclusion that an interim scheme (the detailsof which were outlined in the Memorandum) providingfor direct payments to producers, should be broughtinto operation as soon as practicable, to cover aperiod to the end of March, 1935, the Treasuryadvances to amount to abo\it  3,000,000,In addition to the above the Cabinet had beforethem a Mote by the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries (CP.-187 (34)) covering the draft of aBill embodying the emergency proposals outlined bythe Lord President of the Council in C.P.-182 (.34).The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs gave a detailed account of a meeting he had held with the High Commissioners of the Dominions thesame morning.      The result had been that theDominions had indicated that they could not agreeto the proposed imposition of a duty of Id. per lb.on imported beef with a 50$ perference to theDominions.      Without their consent no duty could be
imposed on their produce until after the expiration    11of the Ottawa Agreement on the subject in NoA^mfee-a?-It would be possible, however, to imposeIa 10f&amp; cut in the amount of the importation fromthe Dominions.      The negotiations with the Argentine  1had not oeen unsatisfactory, and it seemed possible,   j;that agreement might be reached with them if the1attitude of the Dominions were more accommodating.The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought it possible that later on the Dominions might see thatIit was in their interest tocome to an agreement.fThey were faced with two alternative possibilities,the latter of which, namely the imposition of theIquota, would be much worse for them than theacceptance of the proposed duty. He thoughtalso that the Dominions did not perhaps realiseithat the scheme was one for a general limitationof production which-a-pgl-i-e-d- to this country just asmuch as to the Dominions themselves and to theArgentine Republic.        In any event, it was mostimportant to discuss the question of our long-term policy with the Dominions.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs said that had been agreed the same morningsThe Chancellor of the Exchequer thoughtthat whatever the Dominions might say now it was totheir interest to put up with a levy rather than to be subjected to a restriction of their qu-e^ta-s-?and that in due course it should be possible toget them to agree.      If they did not agree theTreasury advances might in the end not be recoverable.This was not a pleasant prospect, but he was preparedto take the risk in the hope that between now and thetime when the proposed Bill expired agreement mightbe reached with the Dominions.

The Cabinet had before them a Joint Memorandumby the Home Secretary and the Postmaster-General(CP.-181 (34)) asking the views of their colleagues on the question whether the Government should take any steps to secure the adoption of the 34-hour system inthis country, in view of the recent experiment by theBritish Broadcasting Corporation.    This experiment,which had been in operation for nearly three months,the Corporation regarded as successful, and represented that the question of extending the system In public use should be considered by the Government.   mhe Memorandumpreviousstated that a number of/Governments had consideredthe 24-hour notation since its adoption was urged byLord Stonehaven&apos; s Committee in 1919, but had. decided against it.    A number of public bodies, however, aswell as the War Office, Admiralty, Royal Air Force,and a majority of the Post Office Advisory Council, had expressed themselves in favour of adopting the new method, and the House of Lords had recently passed a motion in favour of   its adoption by the Post Office.If the matter was to be pursued with the expressedapproval of the Government, the 24-hour notation wouldhave to be adopted sooner or later for pillar-boxes,postmarks, time-tables and. other media in common use,at a total cost to the Post Office of the order of 20,000.   A preliminary conference of the variousinterested parties would be necessary, but action would have to be initiated by the responsible GovernmentDepartmentsf but legislation would not be necessary.The proposal for a 24-hour clock did not commend itself to the Cabinet and the Postmaster-General was authorised to communicate a decision tothis effect to the British Broadcasting corporation in the manner he thought most suitable.
