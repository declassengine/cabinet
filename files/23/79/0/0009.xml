if)/apLIO ORDER,PoliticalMif ottos .[fearing of.previousJ^p f A^opp e *Cabinet 22(34) , Con-ft 1 its ion 7 .)1. The Home Secretary read to the Cabinet aNote on the preservation of public order, which hehad prepared after consideration of the disturbancesthat had arisen in connection with a recent FascistMeeting at Olympia (Appendix&apos;I). The principal points on which he asked for the advice of the Cabinet were as to the desirability of legislation for the followingpurposes(i) To strengthen the powers of thePolice as to entry to a publicmeeting where disturbances wereanticipated:(ii) tq deal with the wearing of uniformby political bodies.The Attorney-General, who attended for this item,made clear that any Clause in the proposed Bill wouldhave to be so drawn as to exclude from its provisionssuch bodies as Boy Scouts and the Salvation Army, andto confine it to   political bodies .   It would prohibitmembers of such bodies from drilling and marching in uniform.    In the course of the disc vis si on he mentioned that drilling could actually be prevented under theMilitary Drilling Act, 1819, but he was reluctant totake action under so old a Statute.It was pointed out that under these proposalspeople would apparently be allowed, to drill so long asthey did not wear uniform, or to walk about the streetsin uniform so long as they did not drill or marchtogether.   They might even march under a banner, headed by a band, with all the men wearing badges, so long asit was not a uniform.    Attention was drawn also to thedifficulty of defining &quot;uniform&quot;.   For example, was asash or badge, such as was often worn by Trade Unionistsor a cockade as worn in the French Revolution, or greyflannel trousers and a white shirt, or an armlet with aswastika on it, a uniform?
The Attorney-General thought that a Clause eonIdhe drawn which would, enable a Magistrate to decide whether there had been a breach of the law or not,more especially as prosecutions would be initiated bythe Director of Public Prosecutions, who would, consider in any particular case whether it was one for action.He said that the Police attached, the greatest  importanceto prohibiting the wearing of uniform.    Politicaluniforms added not a little to their difficulties,since men in uniform were able to recognise each otherat. once, and it was much more difficult to break them up.There was general agreement that it was desirable for the Police to have all the powers that, were necessaryfor the preservation of public order.   There was alsogeneral agreement in the Cabinet that it would, bedesirable to give the Police greater powers for enter-ing buildings  on occasions when they had reason tobelieve that turbulent meetings were to be held,&quot;&quot;he question of legislation to deal with the wearing ofuniforms, however, was felt to require further consider-at ion, more particularly as doubt was felt as towhether public opinion was ripe for Immediate action.&quot;&quot;he Cabinet asreed -(a) That the Home Secretary,  in. his speech in the Parliamentary Debate arranged forthe following day, should confine himself as far as possible to a description ofwhat had happened at the meeting atOlympia, pointing out the limitationsin the present powers of the Police,making clear that the Government are anxious to avoid any infringement ofthe liberty of the subject, but convey-ing a hint that the desirability ofobtaining further powers is being carefullyexamine d:fb) That the Home Secretary shJmld circulate aMemorandum to the Cabinet on all aspectsof his proposals, for consideration attheir next weekly Meeting,(^he. Att. orney-General withdrew .)-2-
2, At the request of the Prime Minister, theParliamentary Secretary to the Treasury (who had been summoned for this item.) made a statement to the Cabineton the present business of the House of Commons, theprincipal points of which are contained in Appendix 7.1.This showed that if Parliament was to rise, as hitherto contemplated, on Friday July 27th, the arrears of workremaining would amount to 9 Sittings.    By means of possible savings and by sitting until Friday Angust 3rdthe arrears could be reduced to 1 Sitting, but even this estimate did not provide any time for amendments toStanding Orders or for the minor Bills referred to onthe last page of Appendix TT,In the course of the discussion the Cabinet were reminded that when the Electricity Supply Bill had beendiscussed, at the Cabinet a good deal, of doubt had been expressed as to whether it would be possible to carrylegislation in the present Session of Parliament.Doubts were again expressed as to whether it would bepossible to find time for the Bill.&quot;&quot;-he Cabinet were also informed that the Voluntary)Hospitals (Paying Patients) Bill was likely to be dropped..The Prime Minister said he was most reluctant tocarry over business until after the Adjournment, as there would be a heavy programme for the Autumn.    Inthe past he had succeeded in avoiding dropping bills which had been included, in the Government&apos;s programme.This year, however, he thought, this would probably be unavoidable.   He. made a strong appeal to his colleagues -( i) to try and. avoid prod.vicing any moreBills:(ii) to consider which Bills could be dropped,and instructed.the Parliamentary Secretary to theTreasury not to make any time allowance for new Bills
that were likely to be contentious and doubtful.(See., also Conclusions 6t  7t 10 and II.)

The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet thatCOMMOWS.  he had arranged that the Government Whips should, beReport ofCommittee of put on in support of the Resolution he was moving inPrivileges.the House of Commons the same afternoon,(Previous &quot;That this House doth agree with the reference: Report of the Committee of Privileges %Cabinet 15(34), Con-   and against any additions to this Motion,elusion 1.)The Cabinet agreed.tl
4. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for the Colonies (0 ,P.-14P (34))containing proposals for the reform of the MalteseCourts.   Annexed to the Memorandum were a despatch from the Governor of Malta and a Report by Sir AlisonRussell, Legal Adviser.   The latter had made an exhaustive examination of the whole legal system, andhis Report disclosed a state of affairs so scandalousas to call for immediate and drastic action.   Thedefect of the present judicial system was a double one:-(i) The procedure of the Courts entailsdelays, which, in a large proportionof cases, amount to a denial of justice.(ii) The proceedings are, with negligibleexceptions, conducted in the Italianlanguage, a language which hardly anyof the litigants are able to understand.With reference to procedure, the Secretary of state proposed to adopt the recommendations of Sir AlisonRussell.    On the language question the Governor of malta submitted, the following specific recommendations.:-I.(a) That Maltese should be the language ofall Courts, both Superior and. inferior,for all criminal cases:    Provided that where an English-speaking person is beingtried the language of the Court shall beEnglish.(b) That Maltese should, be the language ofcivil cases in the Magisterial Courts:Provided, that where all parties areEnglish-speaking persons the languageshall be English.(c) That in the Superior Courts the languageshould, be Maltese er English as may bedirected by the presiding Judge:    Providedthat where all parties are English-speakingpersons the language of the Court shall beEnglish.II. That laws be enacted and published in Malteseand. English only,III. That the translation into Maltese of suchlaws as have not been translated into Malteseshould forthwith be undertaken.The Secretary of State asked authority of the Cabinetto inform the Governor that his proposals were approved in principle, subject to the modification %i

He added that it wouldbe necessary to give legislative effect to the decision in due course, which could be done by an amendment ofthe Malta Constitution Letters Patent.The Secretary of State for the Colonies read an extract from a letter he had received from theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, who was unableto attend the Cabinet owing to formalities in connectionwith the arrival of a Belgian Special Mission.    In this letter the Secretary of State said:-&quot;I am very sorry not to be present when this Paper is discussed, but Ihave thought a good deal about it and,so far as I am concerned,  I should  subject to any considerations which mayemerge durin.Gr the discussion   be preparedto accept your proposals .    In saying thisI do not ignore the fact that we shall certainly be in for a row with theItalians on the subject and that practicaldifficulties may  occur on a number of points.   But on the whole it seems to methat one could hardly justify the contin-continuance of a system which has led to sucha situation as is described in theenclosures to your Paper.&quot;The Cabinet approved, the proposals of theSecretary of State for the Colonies as setforth in CP.-148 (54).

THE POOR LAW(SCOTLAND)BILL.Treatment ofWounds and.DisabilityPens ions,0 * The Cabinet had before them, the following documents on the subject of the Poor Law (Scotland)Bill. Treatment-Wounds and Disability Pensions(previous reference e:Cabinet. 4(34). Con-c Ins i. on 15A Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Scotland. (C.P.-155 (34)) pointing out that Clause 38 (3)(b) of theUnemployment Bill required that,  in determining the need of an applicantfor an allowance under Part ii of theBill, the first one pound of any woundsor disability pension should be disre-gar ded:    that a Bill to amend theScottish Poor law was at present underdiscussion in Committee, with referenceto which an amendment had been put downby a number of the Government supportersto make it obligatory upon Poor LawAuthorities in Scotland to adopt- asimilar course when affording out-doorrelief to a poor person (whether able-bodied or not):    and asking authorityto accept in principle the above amend-ment., which would, not involve anycharge upon Exchequer funds:A Memorandum by the Minister of HealthfC.P.-156 (34)) requesting approval tothe introduction this Session&quot; of a one-Clause Bill to establish the same position in England and Wales if theSecretary of State for Scotlandfs proposal was approved.The Cabinet agreed  (a) ^o approve the proposal of the Secretaryof State for Scotland set forth inC , P .-155 ( 34) and s ximmar is e d above:(b) To take note that the Secretary of Statefor Scotland, would arrange that the new proposal would, not, take effect until after the Appointed Day under Part ii of the Unemployment Act, whatever thatdate might be:(c) That the Minister of Health should beauthorised, during the Autumn, to intro-duce a Bill to establish the same positionin England, and Wales as was now approved,for Scotland.

Fisheries (H.A.-36(34)) covering the dra^t Whaling Industry (Regulation)Bill, which had been approved in principle by theCabinet at the Meeting referred to in the margin,the object of the Bill being to enable Great britain to ratify a Convention for the Regulation of Whalingconcluded in September, 1931:    together with thefollowing recommendation of the Committee of HomeAffairs thereon (H.A.C. 12th Conclusions (34)):-,,rT1o authorise the introduction forth-with in the House of Lords of theWhaling Industry (Regulation) Billin the form of the draft annexed to H.A.-36 (34), subject to the deletion of Section 10 (2) (b) unlessthe Minister of Agriculture andFisheries saw serious  objection tosuch deletion, and subject also toany drafting or other minor aIt era-tions that might be found necessary or desirable.&quot;The Prime Minister pointed, out that the passingof this Bill was necessary as a matter of internationalhonour, and. he would feel found to make a seriouseffort, to secure it, notwithstanding the difficultiesof the Parliamentary position.It was pointed out that some satisfaction wouldbe given to Norway by the passing of the Bill throughthe House of Lords.The Cabinet approved the recommendations  -tion of the Committee of Home affairs as set forth above.

The Cabinet again had before them aMemorandum by the Secretary of State for theColonies  (CP.  145 (34)) on the subject of theIndustrial Development of the Colonial Empire,consideration of which had been postponed at theMeeting referred to in the margin.The subject was adjourned until theChancellor of the Exchequer and theSecretary of State for the colonies had discussed the question.

The Cabinet took note of a Memorandum by theROSIER.itvtafe+on in Secretary of State for India (0 .P.-158 (34)), informing the Wa States .his colleagues of a situation in the Wa States,  onthe ^urmo-Chinese frontier, which was giving cause for some anxiety vis-a-vis China, and indicating the policy he proposed to pursue.The Secretary of State for Indiaundertook to report at once to theCabinet if anything of an untowardnature happened in this part of theworld.-IS-
THE COLONIALSTOCK ACTS.Trustee status of DominionSecurities.(previous reference:Cabinet 32 (33)Conclusion 3).10.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer drew the attention of the Cabinet to a memorandum which he had circulated and which was not onthe Agenda Paper on the subject of proposed legislation to amend the Colonial Stock Acts.(CP.  160 (34).The Cabinet agreed -That the Chancellor of the exchequer should have authority to refer theBill giving effect to his memorandum to the Committee of Home Affairs.
11.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer reportedto the Cabinet that the German Government were now refusing to provide transfer for the interestowing on the Dawes and Young Loans.      We had made the continuance of these payments a conditionof the funding of other debts and had intimated that if the Germans did not carry out their obligations we should be compelled to set up a clearing house in London.      The Germans were notplaying straight in this matter and their policyappeared to be to depreciate the Dawes and YoungLoans with a view to buying up the bonds at a lowprice.     We were therefore approaching a positionwhen we might be compelled i-*i-e-e-e-p^a4ri^n-w4-thf-^^i-gn-Haa-ti-eH.-&amp; to .set up a clearing house forall German payments^.      The Germans at present hada favourable trade balance of  13 million withthis country which would provide an amplemargin both for the service of the Loans inquestion and for the purchase of what Britishiffi-]SK3*a?te^-^ja It wasnecessary to bring the position home to theGermans, and he proposed to inform the GermanGovernment that we intended to introduce legisla-tion to enable us to set up a clearing house.First, however, he vvished to be sure that theCabinet v/ere prepared to support the proposal.The question of whether in the event of legislationbeing introduced it should be confined to germany or made more general was under consideration bythe Treasury in consultation with the Board ofTrade,The President of the Board of Trade said he had reluctantly come to the conclusion that
the course proposed, &quot;by the Chancellor of theExchequer was necessary.      The setting up of a clearing house was a difficult and troublesomematter but he saw no alternative.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he was not hopeful that even this step would bringthe Germans to terms as the Nazis were veryheadstrong.The Cabinet agreed -To authorise the Chancellor of theExchequer and the President of the Boardof Trade whenever they thought fit to notify the Germans of the Government&apos;intention to introduce legislation toenable it to set up in London a clearinghouse for German payments.
THE betting and LOTTERIESBILL.(previous reference:Cabinet 17 (34)Conclusion 13).12,    The Secretary of State for V/ar paid a tribute to the skilful manner in which theSecretary of State for Air had conducted theBetting Bill in the House of Lords with theresult that the Bill had emerged in a form likelyto prove much less contentious when it came before the House of Commons than had originally been apprehended.The Prime Minister on behalf of theCabinet congratulated and thanked the Secretaryof State for Air who paid a tribute to theassistance he had received from colleagues and the Departments concerned.

APPENDIX I.PRESERVATION OF PUBLIC ORDER.Note read by the Home Secretary.In the debate on Thursday I shall be asked what isthe policy of the Government on three questions.(1) the question of preserving &quot;free speech&quot; by preventingor checking the practice which is common in certain areas of organising interruption and disorder at public meetings for the pur-pose of preventing the speaker from getting a hearing.(2) the question of preventing bodily assaults at public meetings, whether the persons most to blame areinterrupters who resist   ejection or stewards who useunnecessary violence in ejecting interrupters.(3) the question of preventing the formation of privatearmies or defence corps and stopping any unofficialorganisation - whatever may be its political complexionfrom arrogating to itself functions which belong tothe police.While there is general agreement that unofficial bodiesought not to be allowed to usurp the powers of the police,it will be represented that, if the police are unable todeal effectively with people who organise disorder for thepurpose of preventing speakers at public meetings fromgetting a hearing, then it is inevitable that bodies likethe Fascists will take the law into  their own hands and will use excessive violence, claiming that they have in view the object of securing the right of free speech.The position of the police in regard to public meetingsheld on private premises is that they have no right toenter such meetings unless either they are invited by the promoters of the meeting   or unless they know that a
breach of the peace is being committed.      If the Policeknow that disorder has broken out and that assaults aretaking place, it is their duty to go in for the purposeof preserving the peace and apprehending offenders.      Theyhave, howevers no right to enter the building - without the permission or invitation of the promoters - merely becausethey apprehend that disorder may; occur.Hitherto the policy of the Police has been based onthe assumption that the promoters of meetings? whendisorder is apprehended;, will usually invite the assistanceof the police.The position has now changed by the growth of the fascist and Communist organisations, who are both of... themunwilling to have police assistance, and this new develop-ment makes it necessary to consider whether the existing; law should not be strengthened by giving the Police power togo into a meeting. - without invitation from the promoters -if the Chief Constable has reasonable ground, for apprehendingthat disorder - as distinct from mere heckling - may occur.The difficulties of the Police at a meeting, whenthey have no invitation from the organisers to be present andwhen they are exposed to the antagonism of both the supportersand their interrupters, will no doubt be substantial, but these difficulties must be faced.      The Government cannotdefend the present position.      The Fascists will continue toorganise big meetings both in London and the Provinces, andto assert their claim to maintain order without Policeintervention.      If the Police have to wait outside such meetings until they have definite information that assaultsare being committed, they can take no effective action to .prevent violence or brutality because in the first placethey cannot intervene till a breach of the peace has arisen,
and secondly because if they only go in after the meetinghas started, they will often be unable to reach the strategic points for taking effective action.I therefore recommend legislation enabling the Police,when there is reasonable ground for apprehending seriousdisturbance, to make arrangements for the posting ofuniformed officers in the building - whether the promoters of the meeting do or do not ask for police assistance.If I can indicate on Thursday that the government recognise that the existing law as regards police inter-vention at public meetings requires strengthening this willenable me to deal with questions (1) and (S) and to meetthe argument that, unless the Police take effective action?it is inevitable that private persons will claim the rightof maintaining and securing order and will often make use of illegal methods.(3)    The strengthening of Police powers of entry into meetings will not, however, deal with the main evilwhich is the formation of private armies or bodies of people who, by the adoption of a uniform and by thepractice of drilling, are trained to act in    concertand to enforce their purposes by methods of force orintimidation.       The existence of such bodies is, inprinciple,  inconsistent with our free institutions, and isin practice - as has already been pointed out to the Cabinetthe source of repeated and serious outbreaks of disorder.I have again thought over the possible methods ofdealing with this problem and I am convinced that there isno method of striking at the heart of the evil except by legislation making it an offence, in connection with any political organisation, for persons wearing a uniform to march about or drill in definite formation or to assemble
in streets or public places.      The exact form which such legislation should take is a matter for careful considera-tion, but something ought to be said on Thursday to indicatewhat is to be the Government1s policy on the question ofprivate armies.      I have repeatedly said in reply to questions that the matter is being carefully watched, andthe House will want to know what is the result of theattention which has been given to the subject.The Fascists claim that they propose to effect theirobjects by constitutional methods.      There is no satisfactoryreply to the question whether the existing law providesadequate measures for dealing with these uniformed publicarmies and the existence of such private armies is thefeature of the present situation which is causing thegreatest amount of disquiet in the country amongstenlightened opinion.      The Attorney General has kindlyoffered to advise on the exact form which this legislation should take, if the Cabinet agree that legislation onthese lines is desirable in the public interest.A Bill dealing with the points&apos;mentioned (viz.(1) strengthening the police powers as regards entry tomeetings and (2) powers to enable effective action to betaken against the organisation of private armies) would, Ibelieve, command widespread   support.     Such a Bill wouldnot be aimed at any particular organisation.      It would bea Bill for the preservation of public order and would, bebased, not on the mere suppression of political uniforms,but on the necessity of preventing the usurpation byprivately organised bodies of functions which properlybelong to the Executive.      To allow private and responsiblebodies to exercise those functions is tantamount to theabdication of authority by the Central Government.      There
is the further substantial risk that the existence ofone private army will lead to the formation of counterarmies.Unless I can announce during the debate that theGovernment recognise that the existing law needsstrengthening along the lines which I have suggested,I see no adequate answer to the very grave criticismswhich will no doubt be raised against the very ineffectivemeasures which, under the existing law, alone are avail-able for dealing with the disorders which we have wit-nessed and which are bound to recur, perhaps on an in-tensified scale.June 13th,  1954.
