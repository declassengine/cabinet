JAPAN. 1. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs invited the attention of the Cabinet to an &quot;informal(previous reference:    statement&quot; given to the Japanese Press on Aor11 ISthCabinet 16(34)    Con-   by the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign AffairscIns ion 4 ,)regarding Japan&apos;s policy towards China and foreignM3Z*)/S? - assistance to that, country, the tenor of which implieda challenge to the principle of equal rights for allPowers in China.    On April 23rd he had accordinglyinstructed His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in ^okyo to speakin the most friendly spirit to the Japanese Ministerfor Foreign Affairs and point out to him that theprinciple of equal rights in China is guaranteed, veryexplicitly by the Nine-Power Treaty, to which japan is a party, and emphasising the rights of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in China.    As yet he had received no message from the Ambassador.The Secretary of State added that the situation was most disturbing,    Japan appeared, to be following the German model.   In both cases there was a treaty in existence which, if carried out, would prevent thenation concerned doing what it wanted to do.   Japanappeared to be acting In breach   of the Nine-PowerTreaty.   Press information, to which he drew attention,was also disturbing.He had received from his Department some comments......on the Japanese action.   It was not believed thattheir motive was derived from events in this country,but from, elsewhere:    e.g., the German Ambassador inWooMington thought that the Japanese did not like theMilitary Mission of General von Seeckt to China:the French Ambassador there connected, the statement with the proposed International Loan to China, which m. Monet, one of the financial advisers to the ChineseGovernment, is said to be negotiating and from which
the Japanese are to &quot;be excluded:    the American Ambassata?in Tokyo thought it was intended to prepare Japanesepublic opinion for a firm Japanese stand over the navalnegotiations:    another theory connected their attitudewith a Report about to be issued by Dr. Ranchman andSir Arthur Salter.The Secretary of State added that he had notcommunicated on the subject with any Government exceptthat of Japan, as he was anxious not to give theimpression of creating an anti-rJapanese bloc.The President of the Board of Trade asked whetherthis information would have any effect on the conversa-tions he was to hold with the Japanese Ambassador.mhe Cabinet agreed  (a) t0 approve the attitude of the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs in makingno present communication to any Govern-ment except that of Japan on the subjectof the Japanese &quot;informal statement&quot;:(b) That the President of the Board of trade should proceed with his conversations with the Japanese Ambassador in ascordial, friendly and helpful a spiritas possible.
reduction and^imitation of armaments .(previous reference:Cabinet 16(34), Con-elusion 1.)2. The Prime Minister reported that the ministerial committee was making progress on the subject of reduction and. Limitation of Armaments.
imperial defence policy,(previous reference:Cabinet 11( 34) , 0 on-clusion 4.)F.R.3, The Cabinet had before them a Joint Memorandumby the Secretaries of State for War and Air, and theFirst Lord of the Admiralty (CP.-113 (34)) urgingresumption of the consideration of the Report of theDefence Requirements Committee (C.P.-64 (34)) in viewof cireurostances which had arisen since it was last discussed, and giving their reasons for pressing for decisions to be taken which would, enable theirrespective Departments to make progress forthwithwith the programmes approved by the Government.The Prime Minister said that owing to great pressure on his time, due to the Committee of Privilegeshe would like a da;/ or two longer to   look into theposition of the Report of the Defence requirements committee.    In a discussion on another subject thequestion had arisen as to whether the Report of theDefence Requirements Committee should be sent to theGovernments of the Dominions.The Secretary of State for War urged that theCabinet should take the Report referred to intoconsideration and, after taking their decisions,should also decide how much should, be communicatedto the Dominions and, as mentioned in CP.-113 (34),to the Parliamentary Opposition.   When, the Report was discussed he would also raise the question of theeducation of public opinion.The Prime Minister agreed with his colleagues that the Report, ought to be c ons considered at a very earlydate.    If agreements were reached in connection withdisarmament it would always be possible to readjustthe decisions on Defence Expenditure thereto.
The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Report of the defence requirements Committee (CP.-64(34)) should be considered at aSpecial Meeting on Monday next,April 30th, at &apos;4-30 p,m., in thePrime Minister&apos;s Room at the Houseof Commons:(b) That besides &apos; &apos;    &apos;      the report and the Prime Minister&apos;s Note thereon(CP .-70 (34)) the Cabinet should consider the question of whether itshould be sent to the Dominions:(c) That a Meeting of the CabinetCommittee on the Naval Conference,which had been arranged for the same afternoon, should, be postponed.-5-
THE NEXT a    The Cabinet had before than the Report b-fIMPERIALCONFERENCE. the Cabinet Committee (C .P.-118 (54)) which hadbeen set -up at the Meeting referred to in the margin(previous reference: to consider the question of the date of the next-Cabinet 16(34), Con- Imperial Conference.   The recommendations made toelusion 2.)the Cabinet- by the Committee were as follows:-(l) That it would be inadvisable to contemplate a formal ImperialConference in the year 19 35.(S) ^hat when the Prime Ministers of theDominions are invited to participate in the Anniversary Celebrations ofHis Majesty&apos;s accession to the Throne-^to be held in London next year, theopportunity should be taken to inform them, that their presence in Englandwould enable informal discussions totake place with United Kingdom ministers on certain important matters.    One ofthese would naturally be the questionof the. date for the holding of the nextImperial Conference.(3) That at these informal discussionsit could be explained why it wouldbe very inconvenient, so far as theUnited Kingdom is concerned, thatan Imperial Conference should beheld, in 19 36, and that we should therefore favour postponement ofthe Conference until 1937.(4) That there is no reason why thisarrangement, should interfere withthe proposed ad hoc Informal discus-8ions between the United Kingdom, andthe Dominions concerned, on meat anddairy products,The Cabinet approved theabove recommendations.
THE INDIANLEGISLATIVEASSEMBLY .Question of holding Elec-tions in theAutumn orExtendineits Life. &apos;(previous reference:Cabinet 16(34), Con-conclusion 5.)5. The Cabinet had. before them a Note by theSecretary of State for India (CP.-115 (34)) circulatingcopies of the telegram he had sent to the Viceroyafter the discussion at the previous Meeting of theCabinet on the subject of holding an Election of theIndian Legislative Assembly in the Autumn or extendingits life, and. of the Viceroy *s reply.At the end. of a statement in which he drew attention to the strong objections urged by theViceroy to prolongation of the life of the IndianLegislative Assembly, the Secretary of State proposedto send a further Private and Personal telegram, ofwhich he read a draft.    After setting out the whole position and contrasting the view of the Cabinet infavour of prolonging the life of the Assembly, and thatof the Viceroy in favour of an early election, thedraft telegram presented the Viceroy with one further questions, namely, as to whether, accepting the viewthat the provisions in the Bill for responsibility atthe centre would be thrown out if there were a violentattack on the White Paper in India, the viceroy was-** *        - \fprepared to accept the risk of this happening ratherthan face the immediate difficulties and bitterness of postponement of the election.In this connection the Cabinet were reminded that responsibility at the centre had been, largely adopted,owing to pressure from the Viceroy.The President of the Board of Education, as an ex-Viceroy, thought it possible to exaggerate the riskin India.   There was a difference between a Congressmajority in the Legislative Assembly and what was likely to result from an election at a time whenCongress was rather discredited.    A good many of thesolid elements in the Legislative Assembly would be
re-elected.   No doubt during the election there wouldbe criticisms to obtain votes, but that need not betaken too seriously.   That was the Indian method ofelectioneering.   The &quot;die-hard&quot; opponents of the bill would do their utmost anyhow, and would make use    ofthe fact that the election had been postponed.   mo thatmight be added resignations.    If, as he understood, itwas believed in India that the Government of Indiawanted, an election and we were standing out, that was serious.    The conclusion he drew was that if the Viceroytook a very decided view the Cabinet would, not bejustified in over-riding him.   Assuming the worst, andthat an attack were made in Parliament on the provisions for responsibility at the centre, accompanied by the worst concatenation of events in India, it might become a question whether the Cabinet might not have to makeit a question of confidence in order to avoid defeat.He did not dissent, however, from, the Secretary ofState&apos;? proposal, but stiggested modifications on the emphasis, in order to avoid any suggestion of coercingthe Viceroy.&quot;he Secretary of State for India mentioned thatit had leaked out that the Government of India favoured an election.The Prime Minister pointed out that the Viceroyfavoured, the holding of an election and was preparedwhileto face the consequences,y the Secretary of State forIndia advocated no general election, owing to there actions it. would have on the Parliamentary positionhere.    If his plan were adopted., however, we should only be postponing the difficulty.    If the Bill wassooner or later to become a millstone round the neckof the Government, with opposition both in India andat home, was it not better to let India face it now?
The Secretary of State for India said that ifonce the Bill were on the Statute-Book a new chapterwould open and he thought that large bodies of indian opinion v/ould accept an established fact.There was general agreement with the Secretaryof State for India that if events developed badly inIndia and there was a raging campaign against theWhite Paper,   the reaction on the Parliamentary positionhere would be very serious.In the end the Secretary of State for Indiaundertook to redraft his telegram in the light of thediscussion.      k copy of the final draft is attached in the Appendix,
INDIA. 6. The Cabinet   took note of     a Memorandum by political the Secretary of State for India (CP.-114 (34))Situationin. circulating further information regarding a statementCivil Dis-        issued by Mr Gandhi on April 7th   in which heobedience.F.ft itofas)!!. advised all Congressmen to suspend, civil disobedience(Previous for Swaraj as distinguished from specific grievancesReference:Cabinet 46      and desired that civil resistance should, be left to(33), Con-clusion 3.)     him alone and not resumed by others in his lifetimeexcept under his direction   and also as to theline of policy which it was proposed to adopt in thesituation now existing.
falkland islands de-pendf.no iesresearch anddevelopmentfund .(previous reference:Cabinet 70(33),  Con-clusion 8.)7,   The Cabinet again bad before them a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for the Colonies (C.P.-295(33)) on the subject of the Falkland Islands Depend-encies Research and Development Fund.   At the meeting mentioned in the margin the Cabinet had taken note that it was proposed to allot (l) a sum of . 125,000for the completion of the &quot;DISCOVERY&quot; investigation,and had postponed consideration of the following additional proposals by the Secretary of State, viz.:-(2)  135,000 for the future needs ofthe Dependencies:(3)  100,000 for a new reserve fund.A good deal of support was lent to the view ofthe Secretary of State for the Colonies that furtherresearch into the whaling industry was not    likely toproduce results which would justify the expenditureof any further considerable sums.    For example, it wasnot likely to lead to a successful international conference for the Preservation of the Whale.    It wasalso recognised that the whaling industry exercisedInjurious economic effects on some of the tropicalColonies by producing a competing raw material forthe manufacture of margarine.   There was some comment on the somewhat barbarous methods of the whalingindustry.It was suggested that proposals (2) and (3) were,strictly speaking, both breaches of trust.The Secretary of State for the Colonies drew a distinction between (2) and (3),    In the case of theformer there was very strong justification for theproposed allotment of  135,000 to the future needs ofthe Dependencies, since for several years the budgetarysurpluses of the administrations concerned had beendevoted to the Falkland Islands Dependencies research and Development Fund,   To allot part of the remaining
funds to the future needs of the Dependencies was justified both for this reason and because the Depend-encies themselves, which now had. a deficit, were maintained in the interests of the whale fisheries.He did not indicate how far the sum of  135,000 was infact balanced by surpluses from past budgets of the dependencies.   He admitted the truth of the Chancellorof the Exchequer&apos;s contention that the  100,000 for anew reserve fund, proposed in (3), was legally a breach of trust and less justified than in the case of (2) .After considerable discussion the Cabinet agreed -That the Secretary of State for theColonies and the Chancellor of theExchequer should consult as tothe allocation of the  235,000 referredto above in (2) and (3),
MALTA.Constitution of.(Previous. - Referene e :$&quot;Cabinet 64(33), Con-c ins 1on 8,)8.      The Cabinet had before then, a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for the Colonies (CP.-110 (34))covering Despatches from the Governor of Malta onthe subject of the Constitutional Future of thatIsland.    In his Memorandum the Secretary of Stateexplained that the present position was that,  inpursuance of the decision taken by the Cabinet atthe Meeting referred to in the margin. parliamentary government was temporarily suspended under a provision in the Constitution itself which enabled Great britain to take over the administration provided that theSecretary of State was satisfied that a grave emergenc;existed.   The Governor of Malta argued that at thepresent time there was no emergency in any reasonablesense of the term, and suggested that an AdvisoryCouncil should be set up, composed of five official and eight unofficial members, appointed by him.   Theproposed Council would have no executive and legisla-tive powers, and for the time being at any rate wouldnot be established by law as a part of the regular   -c ons t itutional machinery . -?*9*hin.........proo-eduro would entai-L------------.---JtoeOiithe abolition of the Constitution, which could, only be,effected, by an Act of the Imperial Parliament, andit had been suggested to the Secretary of State thatthe Bill might simply take the form of providing thatthe King should have in Malta the same power and juris-diction as though the Malta Constitution Act of 1932had not been passed, and. the Malta Constitution letters patent of 1921 had contained a clause reserving toHis Majesty the power to revoke, alter or amend the letters Patent.   Thus on the face of it the Bill couldbe presented as a technical measure and would not interms provide for the &quot;abolition of the Constitution&quot; -phraseology which would be somewhat out of place inthe case of Malta, which had enjoyed-with considerable-13-
interruptions its limited form of self-governmentonly since 1921,   While the Secretary of Stateappreciated the Governor&apos;s difficulties and acceptedhis view that the abolition of the Constitution by imperial Act would be convenient and beneficial in malta, he admitted that the situation at home made such a course very difficult at the present timein view of the legislative programme and especially the India Bill, though he considered it conceivable that circumstances might arise which would make an act imperative:    for example,  if the Malta Courtsshould give a Judgment which impeded Crown ColonyGovernment.    He agreed with Sir David Campbellthat an Advisory Council should, be added to theGovernmental machinery, and proposed to authorisethe Governor to sound privately certain gentlemen,whom   he had named, as to their willingness to serve.In the course of statements made to the Cabinetthe Secretary of State for the Colonies, in additionto various points mentioned in the above summary,informed the Cabinet that if the Governor of Maltafound that he could not obtain suitable members of an advisory Council owing to uncertainty in the Islandas to the future of Crown Colony Government he himselfmight have to come back to the Cabinet and ask for authority to introduce a Bill.After some discussion the Cabinet agreed -To approve the policy proposed by theSecretary of State for the Colonies asset forth in CP. 110 (34) and summarised above.
&quot;Iegotiationswith FOREIGNcountries.Esthonia.(previous reference:Cabinet 48(33), Con-clusion 9 .)9.    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe President of the Board of Trade (0 .P.-112 (.34))submitting a summary of the results of the negotia-tions for a Commercial Agreement with Esthonia, andashing authority to conclude an Agreement on thelines indicated in his Memorandum and its Annex, theAgreement to run until the end of 1936 - the datealready adopted for similar Agreements recentlynegotiated with other countries.The President of the Board of Trade said theonly addition he wished to make to his Memorandum wasthe information that the exchange necessary for thepayment of herrings purchased by Esthonia from theUnited Kingdom had not so far been produced but wasto be found in the early future,The Secretary of State for the Colonies thankedthe President of the Board of Trade for some help to the Colonies.The Cabinet approved the proposals ofthe President of the Board of Tradeand authorised him to conclude anagreement with Esthonia on the lines indicated in CP.  112 (34),
^pHE LAW REFORM       10*    The Cabinet had. under consideration a Memorandum(miscellaneous provisions) by the Lord Chancellor (H.A.-88 (34)) covering theBILL.draft Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill,which dealt with two subjects and carried out therecommendations thereon of the First and Second InterimReports of the Law Revision Committee, set up thisyear under the Chairmanship of the Master of the Rolls:together with the following recommendation by theCommittee of Home Affairs thereon (H..A.C. 8th Oonclu-s ions  (34)):-&quot;To authorise the introduction forthwith,in the House of Lords of the Law Reform(Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill in theform of the draft annexed to H.A.-38 (34),subject to any amendment that might benecessary in Clauses 1 (3) and 3, and toany drafting or other minor alterations that might be found, necessary or desir-able.&quot;The Cabinet approved the recommendation ofthe Committee of Home Affairs as set forth above.-16-
nrgr ELECT.RIOITYfP;PPLY) BILL.(previous reference:Cabinet 11(54).  Con-elusion 11.)11.    The Cabinet had under consideration theElectricity (Supply) Bill, which had been introduced in the House of Commons by a Private Member and wasdown for Report and Third Reading on &apos;Friday, May 4th.No observations were made on this Bill,j2 cw(-17-
I LICENSINGIXSTANDARDISATIONWF HOURS) BILL.(previous reference:i Cabinet 11 (34)Conclusion 18),tR. .12.    The Home Seoretary informed, the Cabinetthat another Bill, the Licensing (Standardisation of hours) Bill, had been passed out of Committee andwould be put down for third rsading on Friday.    Hethought it was unlikely   hat it would be reached.The Bill had been a good deal altered in Committeeand was popular in the House of Commons.The Prime Minister said that if the Bill wasnot reached there would be strong pressure on theGovernment to find parliamentary time for it.
THE BETTING 13.    The Secretary of State for Air, who hadAND LOTTERIESBILL. charge of the Betting and Lotteries Bill in the HottsePrevious of Lords,  said he was impressed by a meeting he had reference:Ijbinet 11 (34) had a few days before in company with the Home Secretaryinclusion 9.with a number of members of Parliament.      Prom apolitical point of view the Bill was opposed on twogrounds;    (l) that it was foolish of the Governmentto take up this matter and so to court unpopularity;(2)  the objections raised by constituents.      The bill was not one that necessarily had to be accepted as awhole.      Some of its provisions he thought would beaccepted.        There was, however,  one question, namelyfootball pools, which was very unpopular and could be dropped on the ground that even though it opened upopportunities for swindlers it was not demoralising.If it was decided to drop the provision for footballpools, it would render tenable the establishment of thepari mutuel which would compete with the racingtotalisator and might ruin its finances.      He was inclined to think that the best parliamentary strategywould be to shape the Bill in the House of Lords into a form which could be passed through the House ofCommons without too much difficulty.      If a concessionwas to be made on t he matter of football pools themoment would have to be carefully chosen.The Home Secretary also reported on themeeting he and the Secretary of State for Air had had with a fully attended meeting of the 1922 Committee,It was clear that the vested interests opposed to theBill had been very busy and on the matter of footballpools public opinion had caught fire.      He agreed!0 that it was possible without raising any very difficult problems to drop the feotball peels- provision of theBill on the ground that it was &quot;off-the-course&quot; betting,I but this would leave loopholes affecting the Tote
Clubs.      If the Secretary of State for Air was to beallowed to make a concession which would be agreed to,he should make a point of explaining that this would leave some loopholes but if anybody took advantageof the position he had better look out for trouble.From the tactical point of view to drop thefootball pools might stimulate the opposition to other provisions of the Bill.      One way out would be toindicate on second reading that the Government were considering the objections raised to the Bill, and might perhaps even go so far as to drop the provision forthe football pools.      Honest people interested in thetotalisator might be met by an alteration inpercentages.In the course of the discussion comment wasmade on the unpopularity of the Bill as a whole and more particularly the provisions for lotteriesas well as for football pools.The Home Secretary thought that, if appropriateconcessions were made during debates in the House ofLords on the lines he had suggested, the Bill would come down to the Commons in a form which would be welcome to a large part of the House.      Moreover,if the Bill were dropped he as Home Secretary wouldhave to administer the existing law and this would bemore unpopular than the Bill itself.The Secretary of State for War, as Leader ofthe House of Lords, informed the Cabinet that thethird,   reading of the Bill could not be obtained in the House of Lords before Whitsuntide,The Cabinet agreed -To authorise the Secretary ef State for Airduring the second reading debate in theHouse of Lords to withdraw the provisionfor football peels.      In doing so he shouldbe asked to explain that this left certainloopholes in the Bill and if people tookadvantage of them it would be at their risk.-20-
14.    The Secretary of State for the colonies informed the Cabinet that the Rubber Agreement was now finally settled.      It was essential that nothing should come out until there was a formal announcement.The Rubber Association would sign the Agreement nextSaturday.    It would be given to the Press on Sundayfor publication on Monday.    He proposed to make his announcement in Parliament on Monday afternoon.M.  Colijn, whose Parliament did not meet until Tuesday,would make his announcement on that day.      Thearrangement would operate from June 1st.      The rubberproducers had accepted the method by which the dutch government proposed to give effect to the scheme.The terms of the letter to the United States of Americawere agreed and would be despatched now;    and theUnited States Embassy should be informed on Mondaymorning of the statement which it was intended shouldbe made in the House of Commons.The Chancellor of the Exchequer congratulatedthe Secretary of State for the Colonies on thesuccessful termination of his negotiations.
UNEMPLOYMENTBENEFIT.Restorationof Cuts,(previous reference:Cabinet 1 (34)Conclusion 6).15,    The Minister of Labour said that for theinformation of colleagues who might be making speeches in public, he intended, after consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, to circulate a papergiving the exact position of the question of therestoration of unemployment cuts.
GERMAN RE-ARMAMENT .(previous reference:Cabinet 14(34), Con-conclusion 3.)fit- ,16.   The Cabinet took note of a Memorandum by thePermanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs(C.P.-116 (34)), circulated, by the Secretary of State,supplementing the information contained in his previouMemorandum (C .P.-104 (34)), oh the subject, of GermanRe-armament, with particular reference to the construetion by Germany of bombing planes on a considerable scale.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.7/.1. ,25th April,  1934*
APPENDIX.Telegram from the Secretary of State for India to theViceroy, dated 25th April, 1934.m------------------------------- IMMEDIATE.First of 2 Parts.1054. P. &amp; P.      Your P.  and P.  telegram of 24th&quot;April271 S.     Assembly Elections.      Cabinet reviewed this very difficult question in light of your telegrams.It comes to this.      On the one hand, if we postponeelection, we must face strong criticism in India,with worsening of situation which you apprehend;    andcriticism will not be confined to India.      On theother side there is risk, approaching certainty that a violent reaction in an election and a new assembly would result in rejection or withdrawal of centralresponsibility part of Bill and would endanger thewhole Bill.     We have to weigh these two considerations.I note your opinion that, owing to disagreements withinCongress, that party will not sweep the countrythough they may win a few seats.      If it should soturn out difficulty here would be pro tanto lessened.Second and last Part.On the other hand our view is that agitationand resentment arising from postponement of electionwould be neither so deep nor so lasting as theconsequences of rejection of central responsibility and possibly the whole scheme, which would immediatelyunite political India against us in a new and bitter&amp; campaign.&apos;we are each now fully apprised of the othersdifficulties and I hesitate to put further question to
4 5you.      But the decision is so critical that I cannotask Cabinet to reach final decision until I have yeuranswer to following question.     Accepting the viewthat central responsibility will almost certainly and provincial autonomy probably, be thrown out if there isa general and unmeasured abuse of Report in theelection campaign and in a new Assembly, would youaccept risk of this happening rather than face more %immediate bitterness and difficulties of postponement of election?
