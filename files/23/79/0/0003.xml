INDIAN LEG IS-LAT3VE ASSEMBLYQuestion of holding El.ee-tions in theAutumn orextending itsLife.(previous reference:Cabinet 17(34), Con-clusion 5.)1..The Cabinet had. before them, a Note by theSecretary of State for India (CP.-120 (34)) circulatingfor the information of his colleagues the Viceroy*reply to the telegram sent as a result of the cabinet discussion at the Meeting referred to in the margin.The Viceroy had. consulted his colleagues, and their view remained unaltered that on broad grounds the wiserand right cotirse was. to hold the elections now.The Secretary of State for India Informed theCabinet that, as the Viceroyrs views were unaltered,he would not feel justified in pressing further hisown view that the life of the present LegislativeAssembly should be prolonged.    Re had prepared adraft telegram authorising the Viceroy to hold thegeneral election:    stating that he himself was stillapprehensive of the reactions of this course on the fate of the Government of India Bill:    and asking that the election might be postponed until the lastpossible moment, namely, December, 1934, or January,1935, by which time the Government of India Billshould have passed its second reading and explanationswould, have been made in the House of Commons.   He also reported that the President of the Board of Educationshared his view.The Cabinet approved the holding ofthe election for the LegislativeAssembly in India on the lines proposedby the Secretary of State for India.-r-
imperial defence policy.(previous reference:Cabinet 17(34), Con-elusion 3.)2. In accordance with the Conclusion mentionedin the margin, the Cabinet held a Special meeting to consider further the following documents on thesvibject of Imperial Defence Policy:-The Report of the Defence requirements committee (C.P..-64 (34)):A Note by the Prime Minister, covering a list of subjects for Cabinet consid-eration (C.P.-70 (34)):A Memorandum, by the Secretaries ofState for War and Air, and the FirstLord of the Admiralty (C.P.-113 (34)):and also to discuss the question whether the above-mentioned Report of the Defence Requirements Committeeshould be communicated to the Prime Ministers of theDominions .The Prime Minister asked what was the decisiondesired that day by the Ministers of the defence services .The First Lord of the Admiralty said his mainanxiety was lest the Report of the Defence Require-ments Committee should be overlooked by the Cabinet,The Secretary of State for War expressed doubt as to whether the Cabinet realised that what theReport of the Defence Requirements Committee providedfor was not     new defensive programmes but merely thecompletion of existing programmes and measures torender existing forces efficient.   The unanimous viewof the Committee was that the forces provided, by the taxpayer were not efficient for the purpose for whichthey existed, owing to the operation of the ten-yearsrule.   That rule was now gone, but it had left us ina position in which it was no longer possible for theforces to take the field in a state of readiness if anemergency arose.    Consequently the decisions for whichhe asked were:-
(l) A decision in principle that, our armamentsmust be rendered efficient:(2) A decision that the education of the public as to the urgency of making good our worst-deficiencies &quot;must be taken in hand:(3) A decision enabling the Departmentsconcerned to work out in detail themeasures required to render the forcesfit to fulfil their respective responsi-bilities.In addition, he would like a decision on one or two points of principle: e,g., the composition of the expeditionary Eorce (D.R,C4 14, para.26), and theprovision of the necessary reserves of ammunition to enable it to take and keep the field until ourmanufacturing resources were able to give the outputnecessary for current expenditure (paras. 87 to 92).Also, in connection with (2) above he would like adecision on the qtrestion of whether the government ought not to take the Opposition into their confidenceas part of the process of educating the public, who,without proper preparation, would be taken by surprisewhen the new defensive programmes were announced.The Secretary of State for Air asked for a decisionon the completion of the 52-squadron programme- forthe Royal Air Force, which had been adopted more than ten years ago.   Even that programme, which was far from complete, fell short of our needs, and we ought to havean additional 25 squadrons .   The proposals in theDefenoe Requirements Committee&apos;s Report were a bareminimum.   He would like to tell the public franklydefic ienc iesthat   our/resulted from the ten-years rule,   Therewas strong public pressure to increase our air force,and. it was time that the Cabinet made up its minddefinitely and told, the country the truth.   He wouldlike a five-year programme.   The reason why he askedfor an early decision was not, that he wanted anycapital expenditure In 1934 (as the Prime Minister had pointed out by reference to Table Al), but that, before
ttOUSE OPOMMONS.ommittee ofrivileges .J^sviousReference:Cabinet 15(54), Con-elusion 1.)any policy would be implemented, detailed plans hadto be worked out for the provision of the necessarybuildings (requiring four years to complete) and personnel, who required three years to train.    He wasdaily subjected to criticism, and he had no replybecause the critics presented an unanswerable case.For example, we were only the fifth Power in the air;England r-Jorth of the Trent, and Scotland, were whollyundefended against air attack.    So he hoped that theCabinet would adopt a policy on the lines of theDefence Requirements Committee&apos;s Report, the reeom-mendations of which were purely for defensive purposes.The Cabinet were reminded of the position that had been reached on this Report,    Tt had first come before the Cabinet on March 7th.   After this thePrime Minister had circulated a questionnaire (CP.-70(34)), which had been discussed at meetings on March14th, 19th and Slst.   A.t the latter meeting thepolitical assumptions on which the Report was foundedwere found to involve the question of &quot;security1,which had also been raised in connection with Disarma-ment.   On March 32nd the Cabinet discussed &quot;security &quot;,which was referred to the Ministerial Committee on disarmament.The Prime Minister reported that the subject of&quot;security&quot; was being systematically examined by the ministerial^ Committee, which, he hoped, would report before long.The principal obstacle to progress at present was thathe himself and the lord President of the Council, as members of the House of Commons Committee of Privileges,found themselves obliged to devote much of their timeto the meetings of that Committee on the mattersraised, by   Mr Winston Churchill.    In order to expeditematters he proposed at the meeting of the ministerial committee on Disarmament arranged for the next day
to make arrangements for the inquiry to be pursued in the absence of the Lord President and himself.In the course of the discussion the suggestion was made that a beginning ought to be made in thedirection of completing our air forces, which shouldbe proceeded with rapidly.    It was recalled that theThree-Party Committee   on Disarmament in 1931 had done a good deal to bring home to the three political parties the extent of our deficiencies, and it wassuggested that this experiment ought to be repeated.But it was recognised that before any communicationcould be made to the Opposition the Cabinet would haveto make   up its own mind as to what was necessary.Some discussion took place as to when the Govern-roent*s policy ought to be announced;    e.g., whether before or after the meeting of the General Commissionof the Disarmament Conference on May 28th.    In favourof making the announcement before that meeting itwas suggested that an early announcement of our intentions would probably have a useful effect- inter-nationally and on Germany in particular.    In favour ofan announcement after the meeting of the GeneralCommission it was represented that the breakdown ofthe Conference, if it took place, would provide aunique opportunity to bring home to the nation that,as all our efforts to bring about disarmament had failed, we could no longer postpone making good ourown. armaments deficiencies.   The Cabinet were reminded,however, that every effort would, be made at Genevato keep the Disarmament Conference alive, and thatthe expected opportunity might not present itself.It was also recognised that the deficiencies asdisclosed in the Report of the Defence requirements committee were of such a character that for themost part     they ought to be proceeded with independ-ently of the results of the Disarmament Conference.
On examination of the time-table it was found, thatif the Ministerial Committee had first to complete. its inquiry on &quot;Security&quot;, most of the time up toWhitsuntide would be needed before final decisions could be reached on Defence Requirements.The Cabinet&apos; agreed  (a) That they should aim at reaching decisions on Defence Requirements within the next three weeks:fb) That the first step was for the ministerial committee on Disarmament to complete itsReport on &quot;Security&quot;:(c) That, as the Prime Minister and the lord president of the Council would be obligedto give much time to the Committee of privileges during the next week or two,arrangements should be made for the ministerial Comsn.ittee to continue its work in their absence:(d) That the Report of the ministerial committee on &quot;Security&quot; should be presented to the Cabinet as soon aspossible.
imperial defence policy....Report of DefenceOecjquirementsCommittee,...The Test of theGerman Menace.3.      The Cabinet then turned to the PrimeMinister&apos;s Questionnaire, CP. 70 (34), on theReport of the Defence Requirements Committee.The Prime Minister read Paragraph 7 asfollows:-&apos;&apos;The Test of the German Menace.      Does theCabinet endorse the suggestion that we ought to provide within five years: fordefensive requirements against attack by Germany?&quot;The question was raised as to whether attack by Germany meant attack on this country or whether it also involved the Low Countries.The Prime Minister said the real point todecide was as to whether we ought to have regardto Germany in our defensive preparations.      It mightbe possible, for example, to take Germany intoaccount for military purposes without taking herpolitically.The Secretary of State for the Coloniesthought it important to consider whether within fiveyears Germany would be in a position to take suchaction as might compel us to operate in the low countries.      He recalled that in discussions at the ministerial Committee on Disarmament the Chiefs ofStaff had expressed the view that in order toprovide a sufficient threat to German industrial and munitions centres it would be necessary roughlyfor an international force to have a superiority inthe air of three to one against Germany.    Nothingshort of this would in their view present a sufficientdeterrent.       He wondered how this affected thequestion of attack by Germany on this country.Even if Germany could acquire aeroplanes it would takea few years to train up and consolidate an air force.He thought the Cabinet ought to know how many aeroplanesGermany would need to attack this country.-7-
The Secretary of State for Air said -thatthe idea of the Air Staff was that Germany couldnot provide an effective air force for about fiveyears.The Cabinet were reminded that air forces had been created in very much less time during theGreat War, but it was pointed out that progress could never be made at the same rate in time of peace,and that under modern conditions inexperienced pilotswould be at the mercy of trained men.      It was also pointed out that the Committee had weighed theseandconsiderations/that their views were summarised in Paragraphs 11 to 14 of CP. 64 (34) as well asin later paragraphs of the Report.The Secretary of State for India suggestedthat the question ought to be approached rather asthe Cabinet had approached the question of the TenYear Rule.      He would take an arbitrary term, forexample, five years within which we were not liableto attack and keep it under constant review at theCommittee of Imperial Defence.      In that way ifEurope became more peaceable  our own arrangements could be slowed down as had happened in the case ofthe original 52 squadron scheme for the Royal AirForce,The Secretary of State for Air pointed outthat the difference to-day was that the world was-arming whereas from 1923-1930 other countries had been disarming.The Prime Minister pointed out that the RoyalAir Force deficiencies dealt with in the Reportof the Defence Requirements Committee were in thenature of expansion.      Consequently, it was necessaryto take some period like five years during which wecould be secure from attack by Germany and keep it under constant review.
The Secretary of State for Air pointed outthat in 1933 it was assumed that we required 53squadrons as a hare minimum taking all commitmentsinto consideration.      That force was still a hareminimum.On the suggestion of the Prime Minister theCabinet adopted the following formula -(a) The assumption should he made that fiveyears would he required to complete ourdeficiencies, and, if completed, thiswould enable us  to deal with attack byGermany.(b) In the meantime, the question should bekept under constant review.
4.      The Cabinet then reverted to the questionof future procedure on this question.The Secretary of State for Air insisted onthe importance of an early decision on therequirements of the Royal Air Force owing to thetime required for making plans for implementingwhatever policy was adopted.      This involved arrange-ments for taking in more men for building, training,etc.The Prime Minister pointed out that theproposal in the British Draft Convention forequality in aircraft between the principal Powerson the basis of 500 aircraft was still open.      TheGovernment could not announce a new programmeuntil that question was settled.The Secretary of State for Air said thatthe question might not be settled for a long time.The Prime Minister recalled that the lord president had said that if the Disarmament Conferencedid not succeed we should try for some kind ofair agreement.    - In view of that statement we could hardly come out in public and say that we were now working towards a much larger air force.The Secretary of State for Air pointed outthat the Germans had practically done so.The Prime Minister agreed that as soon as theright point was reached we ought to develop our programme.     Although the Air Ministry was being pressed hard by interested parties, these proposals were not going to be popular.The Secretary of State for War said hehad never been under the delusion that the proposals would be popular.      He urged, however, that whatever decision was reached it was essential to announce it,as the responsibility of the National Governmentfor the safety of the country was involved.-10-
The Cabinet would have to consider the right wayof taking the public into their confidence.The Prime Minister agreed.The Cabinet agreed -That the Secretary should be instructedto place the subject of defence requirements on the Agenda Paper everyweek in order that the Cabinet might beapprised of exactly how the questionstood.(See also Conclusion 2,page 6).2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I.,let May, 1934.
