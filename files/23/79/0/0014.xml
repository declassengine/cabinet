The date, of there-assembly of Parliament was not yet settled, but hehad hopes of a more convenient date than the one originally contemplated.

ppLlC ORDER,fLes ervat ion&quot;evidusJeferenc e:cabinet 28KM), 0on-plus ion 8,)31) 32. The Cabinet had before them a Most Secret    * C &quot;Memorandum by the Home Secretary (CP.-189 (34)) onthe subject of the Preservation of Public Order,stating that since the Meeting of the Cabinet on june 13th (Cabinet 24 (34), Conclusion 1) he had hadan opportunity of consulting representative and experienced Chief Officers of the Police, whose viewshe mentioned in the course of his Paper, and attachinga Memorandum by the Commissioner of Police of the metropolis, giving the latter&apos;s views on the generalsituation and indicating the steps which, in his judgment, should be taken.   After discussing theseveral different aspects of the problem the HomeSecretary gave the following stimmarised. statement ofthe proposals he: recommended for adoption:-(i) That the police should be given powerof entry to public meetings held on private premises where the Chief Constablehas reason to believe that disorder islikely to occur.(ii) If the Cabinet decide that steps must betaken to prevent a repetition of UnemployedMarches, that the Secretary of State shouldbe empowered to prohibit by order eoncentra-tion of persons outside the areas in whichthey reside if he is satisfied, that the concentration is likely to lead to seriousdisorder or the derangement of the publicassistance administration.(iii) That Chief Constables be empowered to prohibit open air meetings and processionswhich are likely either (a) to interferewith the transaction of business by public authorities, or (b) to result in clasheswith rival meetings, whether held indooror outdoor.(iv) That Chief Constables should be empoweredto prescribe the route of processions.(v)&apos;That it should be an offence to be inpossession of offensive weapons whentaking part in a meeting or procession.(vi) That it should be an offence for any person,in pursuit of a political object, to formany body of persons into an organisationof a military character, by drill, or bythe use of uniforms, or by the use ofother military methods.   Persons who aid and abet the organisers and persons who take part in such an organisation shouldalso be liable to criminal proceedings.
The Home Secretary proposed, if the Cabinet concurred in these recommendations, that opportunity should be-taken before the Summer Recess fbr discussing them withthe leaders of the Opposition Parties with a view to seeing whether it was possible to reach some measureof agreement before legislation was proposed.The Home Secretary made a statement on each ofhis recommendations as set forth above.   Recommendation(vi), he pointed out, raised the problem of privatearmies .   Belgium had now followed the Swedish exampleand had passed a law on the subject.   The example ofthe British Black Shirts was already being followed byother bodies:    e,g., the Communists had held a meeting in khaki shirts and. flannel trousers.   The issue was whether to let the question drift or to tackle it.He thought that public opinion was prepared for theview that the wearing of uniforms was a matter for theGox^ernment, the Police and the local Authorities,and that, while the utmost freedom of speech shouldbe permitted, the challenge to Government by movementssimilar to the Black Shirts, with their elaborateorganisation with its Chief of Staff, O.C, defence force, Section to correspond with foreign Fascists,and so forth, would not be tolerated.   He had under-taken to see representatives of other Parties (including mr. Maxton, M.P.) before the Recess, and he proposed, togive them the heads of such proposals as the cabinet might agree.   This would probably involve somepublicity.   After the Recess he hoped to see theleaders again, after which he would present his proposals to the Cabinet.It was suggested that the second recommendation,namely, to take steps to prevent a repetition ofunemployed marches, would not be popular owing to thegeneral sympathy with the plight of the unemployed.
To include it might endanger the remainder of theproposals.The third recommendation, namely, to empowerChief Constables to prohibit open air meetings andprocessions, was also strongly criticised.    It waspointed, out that open air meetings were resorted tomainly by poor people who could not afford the hireof halls for public meetings.   Moreover, the number ofprocessions in different parts of the country everySunday was very large in the aggregate.   These powers,it was suggested, were much too wide to be placed inthe hands of Chief Constables, who would probably failfor example to realise/that the route .of many processions wasdevised rather from the point of view of filling thesubscription-boxes than of political considerations.The Minister of Labour pointed, out that under thenew Unemployment Act a doubt arose as to how far aPublic Assistance Committee would be able to give assistance to hunger-marchers.   Relief authorities might be able to do something, but the unemployment assistance Board had no powers to give relief in kind.Be would like to look into that with the Minister ofHealth.   He admitted that Relieving Officers hadpowers to relieve the distress of an individual, buthe doubted if those powers could be exercisedcontinuously for a period of, say, ten days.The suggestion was made that the Home Secretary,in framing any legislation, should not base himself on any foreign precedents, but on the establishedprinciple of the British Constitution that there isonly one authority for the maintenance of law andorder in this country, and that was the Government.Emphasis was also laid, on the consideration that ifthe Black Shirts were allowed to have their own army the creation of other armies would inevitably follow in due c ours e .
The Secretary of State for Scotland urged that inScotland the powers under recommendations (ii) and(in) should not he conferred on the Secretary ofState, but should be exercised by a Magistrate.The Secretary of state for War recalled that the fascist Movement in this country had, come into beingbecause the maintenance of order was left to the organisers of a public meeting.   Unless means were provided by the Government for the maintenance of order it would be difficult to ask Fascists to abandon their organisation for this purpose.   He agreed thatfreedom o* speech was essentially a British institution,but. at the present time in many districts Communistaction was preventinct it.   Unless that was put rightby Government action there would be a legitimategrievance on the part of those who had organised theirown system for securing freedom of speech.The Home Secretary pointed, out that anyone was. at liberty to provide for the maintenance of order at ameeting by organising stewards.   What he objected towas that, while maintaining order by means of uniformedFascis fsmen, the -/refused admission to the Police.     his proposals were aimed at the Communists no less thanthe Fasc is ts .A suggestion was made that, power should be taken for the Police present at meetings to take the names and. addresses of interrupters, and to proceed against them.Another suggestion was to delete from, recommendation(ii) the. final words,  &quot;or the derangement of thepublic assistance administration&quot;.A suggestion affecting recommendation (vi) was thatthe words  &quot;a military character&quot; might be rather toolimited in their scope.
The Attorney-General said, his idea was to fix on certain characteristics of these private armies which^he scope ofwould avoid the inclusion in/the proposed legislation of such bodies as the Salvation Army, Boy Scouts, etc.In reply to a question he said, that technically muchof the action taken by the political organisationsunder consideration was    breaches of ancient Statutes,sometimes passed, for emergency purposes:    but this was true also of the Boy Scouts movement.The Home Secretary mentioned in the course of thediscussion that the meetings at the White City and,so far as he knew, in Hyde Park arranged for Augusthad been abandoned, but that a later meeting of Fascistswas to take place in Hyde Park in September.The Cabinet agreed  (a) mo approve the proposal of the HomeSecretary that before the end. of theParliamentary Session he should meetthe leaders of the Opposition and handthem for consideration the heads of theproposals he wished to discuss with them,but without suggesting that the cabinet had reached any decision on those pro-posals :(b) That a-C-a%4ftet--S^rolrfe^e-e-,--e^mp-os^d--as-- o44rOws  The lord President of the Council,The lord Chancellor,The Secretary of State for Home Affairs,The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs,The Secretary of State for Scotland  should meet       assist the Home secretary in drawing up the heads to be presented&quot;to the Opposition Leaders, with full authority to approve them&apos;without referenceback to the Cabinet.
IMPERIAL 3. The Cabinet had before them an Interim ReportIfJpFNCF.POLICY. by the Ministerial Committee on Disarmament on theDefence. subject of Air Defence (C,P.-193 (34)), the recommend-terim Report    at ions of which are included in the Cabinet *s decisionsthe Minis-rial 0ornmi11eeras stiinmarised below,Disarmament.The First Lord of the Admiralty asked to be satisfiedpreviousReference:Cabinet 28(34), Con-f his ion 3.)as to the provision to be made for aircraft for theFleet Air Arm.    He had already raised this point as amember of the Ministerial Committee at the time whenthe Report of the Sub-Committee on this question ofQ^l^&amp;L.-   Air defence was under consideration, and had receivedassurances that all the aircraft, including more especial-ly the seaplanes for the Cruiser Programmes for 1933-4,19 34-5 and 19 35-6, would be provided out of the totalallotment of  20,000,000 to the Air Ministry.   Now,however, in the third line from the end of paragraph 12of CP.-193 (34) and again In the footnote to paragraph19 (l)(a), he found it stated, that &quot;There may, inaddition, be a small requirement for the CruiserProgramme 1934-35-36&quot; .   He did not know how this word&quot;may&quot; had come to be introduced, for it certainly shouldbe &quot;will&quot;.    Referring to the Appendix, he criticisedthe annual instalments for the provision of aircraft for the Fleet Air Arm, which did not fall in with theAdmiralty&quot;s views.   The Admiralty, he pointed out, hadnot been consulted in regard to this Appendix.The Secretary to the Cabinet, however, explainedthat the Chief of the Air Staff had produced, it at his request at very short notice and. under great pressure,and it had. not been possible to consult the Admiraltywithout holding up the circulation of the Report to theCabinet.The Cabinet were informed that the ministerial committee had received, assurances that, the Air ministry had. every intention of providing the aircraft required
both for the Carrier and. for the Cruiser programme by the proper date, though they had not found it possible in the time available to go into this question in detail with the Chief of the Naval Staff.The Secretary of State for Air pointed out thatsome time must elapse before the Cruisers would beready, and there was ample time for the Admiralty andthe Air Ministry to adjust this question.The Chancellor of the Exchequer drew attention to paragraph 17, in which it was made clear that theprogramme was not a rigid one and would have to be adapted to the needs of the future situation.   this appeared to give the First Lord of the Admiralty every-safeguard.The Lord President of the Council agreed with theChancellor of the Exchequer and said that the rate ofthe provision of the aircraft must be adjusted betweenthe Admiralty and the Air Ministry, subject to theapproval of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs called attention to the recommendation in paragraph 16 that,apart from the needs of Singapore, one additionalR.A.F. Squadron should be provided for the Far Bast.He wondered whether this was the best value to beobtained for the expenditure involved:    would it notbe better to devote the same sum to the provision of aerodromes at the various ports in the Far East?    Inthis way, if aeroplanes could, be spared from elsewhere,some provision could be made in time of war for thedefence of the ports concerned.The Secretary of State for India supported, theproposal generally, but urged that the additionalSquadron should be provided, and. that an attempt should be made,  in addition, to provide the landing-grounds out of the  30,000,000,
The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested, thatwhen the Committee of Imperial Defence was lookinginto the question of the location of the Squadronrecommended, for the Far East apart from. Singapore,in accordance with recommendation (4), they shouldalso consider the possibility of providing landing-grounds at the various ports in the Far East (Hong-Kong, Penang, Ceylon ports and Aden) with a view toreinforcing these ports on emergency if the circum-stances of the time enabled aircraft to be madeavailable for the purpose..The First lord of the Admiralty and the Secretaryof State for War&apos;asked that it might be placed on record that they had accepted, the proposals for air defence    in 0 .P..-193 (34) on the understanding, whichhad been given them at the Ministerial Committee, thatthe defence requirements of the Navy and Armyrespectively would, not be prejudiced by this decision.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the Interim Report by the ministerial Committee on Disarmamentdealing with Air Defence (CP.-193 (34)),the recommendations of which are summarised in the last paragraph as follows:-(l) The provision of 4Cg new Squadrons ofthe Royal A,ir Force&apos;&quot;&quot;for the followings ervic es:-(a) 33 Squadrons for Home Defence,making, with, the existing 42Squadrons, a total of 75 Squadrons.(b) 3-^ Squadrons for the Fleet Air Arm.(o) 3 Squadrons for Singapore,(d)  1 Squadron for the Far East,exclusive of Singapore.(2) The above forces to be provided within five, years from 1934, at a total costestimated at  20,000,000.   The suggestedannual instalments of the programme and.their approximate cost are shown inthe Appendix,(3) In order to test the suitability of theFleet air Arm to co-operate directly in home Defence, and of Home Defence units to co-operate with the Fleet Air Arm, incase of necessity, the Admiralty and Air
itMinistry should concert experiments intraining one or two Squadrons from theFleet Air Arm. and the Home Defence AirForce respectively to undertake the dualrole, and should report on the result tothe Committee of Imperial Defence withina period not exceeding two years.   Inaddition, the two Departments should examine the question of interchangeabilityin all its aspects, including that of design of aircraft.(4) The decision as to the final destination of the Squadron recommended for the far east apart from Singapore should be postponed, until, the Committee of ImperialDefence, advised by the Chiefs of StaffSub-Committee, has been consulted.(5) Our Defence position ought to be keptconstantly under review, and the programmerecommended should, be adjusted from timeto time in the light of new factors- inthe situation.    In particular, theChancellor of the Exchequer does notbind himself or his successors to find the additional sums mentioned in thisReport within five years or in theparticular years to which they areallotted.(b) That the intention of the Cabinet is toprovide the aircraft required for the/ tj Ik j$ 1 e\ is!L      Cruisers of the -^I-9-g4-g -36- pr ogramme, aswell as for the Carrier, and that the datesat which they are to be furnished shouldbe settled by arrangement between the FirstLord of the Admiralty and. the Secretary ofState for Air, subject to the agreement ofthe Chancellor of the Exchequer.(c) That, in considering the final destination of the Squadron to be sent to the Far Eastapart from Singapore (Conclusion (a)(4)above), the Committee of Imperial defence should also examine the possibility and.advisability of providing landing-groundsat some or all of the ports concerned(Hong-Kong, Penang, Ceylon ports, Aden),with a view to a possible scheme of-  emergency reinforcement if, when theemergency arises, aircraft can be madeavailable from elsewhere.(d) That a statement of the Government&apos;s proposals,as set forth above, should, be made both inthe House of Commons and. in the House ofLords on Thursday, July 19th.(e) That the preparation of this statement should be in the hands of the lord president of the Council, who would consult the Chancellor of the Exchequer,the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs and the Secretary of State for Air.
Itr raidsPrecautionsK previous reference:Cabinet 88(34), Con-elusion 4.)totem.4.     The Cabinet again had before them the following documents on the subject of Air Raids Precautions,further consideration of which had been postponedat the Meeting referred to in the margin:-A Memorandum by the Chiefs of StaffSub-Committee, together with draftRecommendations of the Committee ofImperial &quot;&quot;defence thereon (C.P.-179 (34)):A Report by the Air Raids Precautions(Organisation) Sub-Committee (C.P.-180 (34)).After a short discussion the Cabinet agreed -(a) That no statement on Air Raids Precautionsshould be made as part of the general statement on Air Defence referred toin the previous conclusion.(b) That at their next meeting the cabinet should consider the advisability of makinga statement in the course of the debatewhich was likely to result from thestatement on policy.-11-
ipANESE 5*     Tlie Cabinet had before them a Note by theIoaDE COM-KlTlON. Secretary of State for the Colonies (CP.-191 (34))os it ion circulating for the information of his colleagues,$Vex tileIptas in in continuation of CP.-172 (34)  and C.P.-184 (34),copies of further telegraphic correspondence with the-previous Governor of Ceylon on the subject of &quot;Japanese TradeReference:Cabinet 28 Competition - Imposition of Textile Quotas in Ceylon&quot;,1(34), Con-conclusion   6.) The Secretary of State for the Coloniesf.R.said that he and the President of the Board of trade were now agreed that if the Ceylon Ministers were notprepared to back the compromise solution, the only possible course would be the imposition of a quota.The procedure would be to pass an Order in Councilin London empowering the Governor of Ceylon to impose a quota by regulation.      He hoped to know theattitude of the Ministers not later than the following day.The President of the Board of Trade confirmedhis attitude as stated above.In reply to a question the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies said he was not particularlyapprehensive of a constitutional crisis in Ceylon^If, as the Governor had suggested, the local Chamberrefused to pass the Budget,this/could be certified ashad happened before now.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,while appreciating the action in this matter whichwas contemplated by the Secretary of State for theColonies, and while accepting his share of Cabinetresponsibility in the decision, felt bound to warnhis colleagues that from an international point ofview the action now being taken was rather significant.The Colony of Ceylon was being compelled to impose a quota on Japanese goods and thus to restrict the&apos;   -12-
market on which Japan counted.     What the ultimateresult would he he could not say.        Other nationsmight follow our example and it might happenthat Japan would make out an exclusive zone forher own trade in China.      It was true that thiswould involve &quot;breaking existing treaties, hut japan had broken treaties before and if she did so againno one could suggest how to s top her.The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggestedthat this indicated the desirability of coming toan agreement with Japan on trade in China.The President of the Board of Trade said LLul&apos;that thrirS-w-as-^-ow-being a4vteap4f-e-d-, and he-jstas-giad-te-nsay that.&apos;his efforts had not! been interruptedThe Secretary of State for the Coloniespointed out that in Ceylon he was only doing what he had been compelled to do in some otherColonies which v/ere perhaps worse placed than Ceylonfrom a commercial point of view.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsappreciated this and that the action taken wasin the interests of the United Kingdom and perhapsof the Colonies themselves.      He thought, however,that the Cabinet had not by any means heard the jlast of this question.The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed withthis last observation, and pointed out that it.wasonly an incident in a conflict between western andjeastern standards...... ;jThe President of the Board of Trade said thequestion in large was as to whether we were to comedown to eastern or Japan was to rise to westernstandards.
The Cabinet approved the course proposedby the Secretary of State for theColonies, namely, that if Ministers in ceylon did not adopt the compromiseagreement, the only course was to impose a quota and to proceed by Order in Council.
JP   RATIONAL        6.    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum byiSv^BSFAS the First Commissioner of Works (CP.-183 (34)) askingBANS) BILL,   ai,tll0rity t0 re-introduce the National Gallery (Overseastrevious Loans) Bill, giving power to the National and TateppferencetCatinet 37     Galleries   but excluding the British Museum, who(31).

The Boards ofthe National Portrait Gallery and of the national gallery of Scotland, and the Board of Education asauthority over the Victoria and Albert Museum, alreadypossessed the general powers it was now proposed, toconfer on the National and Tate Galleries.   The first commissioner added that the actual draft of the Billshould be examined by the Committee of Home Affairsbefore introduction.The First Commissioner of Works said he didnot expect to pass the Bill in the first part of thepresent session of Parliament and he was doubtfuleven about its passing in the autumn part of the session.      He had, however,promised the Prime Ministerto bring the Bill before the Cabinet as soon aspossible.      He thought it would not be met with muchopposition in the House of Commons but he anticipatedopposition in the House of Lords.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs asked whether the houses of British High commissioners in the Dominions could not be brought within the scopeof the scheme.The First Commissioner of Works pointed outthat the number of pictures available was not verygreat.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs suggested that a beginning should be made with the-15-
Embassies and if the resources were found to be larger than had been anticipated its extensionmight be considered.The Secretary ofvnState for War hoped that no attempt would b e made to push the Bill throughduring the present session even in the autumn.The Cabinet agreed -(a) That the First Commissioner of works should complete the drafting of the bill and submit it to the Committee ofHome Affairs.(b) That the date of its introduction shouldbe left open.

iEMPIOYMENTSSISTANCE.Minis tra-.pon oftransitionalPayments atIsrns ley,previous reference:Cabinet 26(34), Con-clusion 7.)8.    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Labour (CP.-192 (34)) on thesubject of the administration of Transitional Paymentsat Barns ley,  in which he pointed out that ever sincethe inception of&apos; the transitional Payments SchemeBarnsley had been a source of anxiety to his Depart-ment.   At the present time the Public assistance committee in that town were in fact issuing determina-tions of Transitional Payments at the full UnemploymentBenefit rates in all cases, irrespective of theresources of the applicants,   This action renderednugatory in Barns ley the whole Transitional PaymentsScheme, and could only be construed as a direct and.deliberate defiance of the law.   He was satisfiedthat the movement in Barnsley was political anddesigned to discredit the Unemployment assistance board and. to make its work more difficult.    In thesecircumstances the Minister of Labour proposed, withthe concurrence of his colleagues, to give theBarnsley Authority immediate warning that he wouldappoint a Commissioner to administer the transitional payments in Barnsley unless within a fortnight theCouncil brought their administration into comformitywith, the law.After a short discussion, the Cabinet -approved the action proposed by theMinister of Labour as set forth above.2* Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,,18th July, 1934.
