378  I!(HJSTRIA.porms of^gistaneeto.I (previous reference cabinet 5(34), Con-elusion 18.)1. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs invited the attention and advice of the Cabinet inregard to the immediate situation of Austria, concerningwhich there had been a considerable discussion atGeneva.    At the moment Austria was the foous ofanxiety in Europe, and our part in the forthcomingdevelopments should be carefully thought out in advance and skilfully played.In February last, at the time of the proposedJoint Declaration by France, Italy and ours elves, wehad. stated that the integrity and independence ofAustria were an object of British policy.   this declaration had had a steadying effect up to the timeof the murder of Dr. Doll fuss and. the outbreak un austria in July .When in Geneva in Aiigust,.    the Secretary of state had seen the new Austrian Chancellor and. the newAustrian Foreign Minister, who were anxious to know what assistance we could render in certain events.They were satisfied, that they could maintain internal order in Austria without foreign help, but that ifthey were subjected to any form of external pressurethey must have foreign assistance.   By this they didnot mean financial assistance, but some form of guarantee to be given by the Great Powers,     The Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs said that he had replied inthe most definite manner that it was quite out of thequestion for the United. Kingdom to enter into any new commitments of any kind, and that our policy remainedas stated in the Aide-memoire handed to the AustrianMinister on February 9th last.   The Austrian ministers had. accepted this reply.Since then Italy had been very active, the latestposition being summarised in the three telegrams from
the Lord Privy Seal at Geneva, dated September 24th.Mussolini /was most anxious for a guarantee to be givenby Prance, Italy and the United. Kingdom, and had.submitted the terms of his proposed, document.   mheLord Privy Seal and the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs had declined to take any part in the discus-sions at Geneva between France and. Italy.   These twocountries&apos; were in fact very far from agreement on theterms of the document, while the objections of other interested parties would no doubt be forthcoming.Italy wanted the proposed guarantee in order that she might have a free hand, when the moment arrived, to go into Austria.    She had hithert o refused to allowYugo-Slavia to part icipate in the discussions, andill-feeling between the two countries was being fannedby violent articles in their respective Presses.It was necessary to face the fact that if anotherrevolt occurred in Austria, Italy might march in,Yugo-Slavia would do the same, and this might well bethe start of a general conflagration.   The question was,hew best could we maintain our influence withMussolini and. prevent him from seeking other friends-Germany, for example.   The Secretary of Staterecommended the Cabinet to adopt a policy on thefollowing lines:-&quot;(l) We stand by our declaration of February17th.(2) We confirm that there can be no newengagement or commitment by Great-Britain in respect of Austria.(?) If discussions continue between france and  Italy as to a new pact of guarantee to secure the independence of Austriawe should., on the above grounds, and toavoid misunderstanding, take no part inthe discussions.   We could, however,indicate at the proper time that theJoint Declaration of February, to whichwe are parties and. by which we stand,naturally implies and actually contem-plates that the parties to the declara-tion should keep in touch on the Austriansituation and. should not take action without consulting one another.
(4) Sir- e. Druroreond will shortly be returning to Rome and M. Barthou. intends to pay a visit there in the middle of next month.It Is desirable to relegate further discussion on the subject  of Austria, sofar as we are concerned, to the time ofthat visit and not to come out now witha new declaration which is likely to beregarded in some quarters as insufficientand in other quarters as implying, though not expressing, some sort of new commitment&quot;.In the course of discuss j. on general agreement was expressed with the proposals of the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs, and the Cabinet were informed bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer that It was not&apos;improbable that Austria would be able to overcomeher financial difficulties by means of certainConversion operations and other expedients.The view was expressed that every effort shouldbe made to bring about better relations between themembers of the Little Entente, particularly Yugo-Slaviaand Italy.    Could it not be pointed out that, if Austriacollapsed, the whole Danubian settlement would be inthe melting-pot?The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thoughtthat it was difficult to say whether Italy or Yugo-Slavia was most to blame for their present bad relations.He was satisfied that it was most Important for us tomaintain close contact with Mussolini, and the problem was how to keep him in such a frame of mind that hewould be prepared to consult us before taking action and in any case do nothing violent on his own account.The Cabinet agreed -(a) To approve the line taken at Genevaby the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs and the lord Privy Seal in refusing to enter into any new engage-roe nt In respect of Austria:(b) To approve generally the line of policy recommended, by the secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs and quoted above in(l). (2), &apos; (3) and (-4) .
-proposals forform of theurts .previous ousHeferenc e:cabinet 2434), Con-Ins i on 4.)2. With reference to the Conclusion mentioned inthe roarsin, the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs raised as a matter of urgency a proposal that theGovernor of Malta should bring into effect, as from october 1st next, a change in the existing law in malta, under which instruction in Law in the MaltaUniversity is at present given in the Italian language.The proposal was that Law should, in future be taughtnot in Italian but in English.    In view of the decisionto make Maltese and English the languages of the MalteseCourts it was perhaps not illogical to substituteEnglish for Italian in the Law School:   but it wouldhave been much more logical to have substitutedMaltese or English for&apos;Italian in that School.The Permanent Under-Seeretary of State for theColonies, who was present at the Cabinet owing to theabsence at Balmoral, in attendance on His Majesty,of the Secretary of State, observed that in fact theproposal was that legal instruction should be giveneither in English or in Maltese.&quot;&quot;&quot;he Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat, in view of the very delicate situation vis-a-visItaly, this was a very inopportune moment for a pin-prick of this kind.    Moreover, in July last, in replyto an enquiry by the Counsellor of the Italian Embassywhether changes  in the Secondary Schools and Universitywere contemplated in connection with rumours which had.reached him for reducing the use of the Italian languagein the Law Courts, after consultation with the ColonialOffice S. Vitetti had been informed that &quot;rumoursregarding changes in the Secondary Schools and. Universitywere baseless&quot;.    It would not be easy to explain awaythis reversal of the assurance given in July.   mussolini had always treated Malta as a problem of secondary
importance, and he (the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs) hoped that it would be possible to postpone the proposed change for at any rate twelve months.The Permanent Under-Secretary of State for theColonies reminded, the Cabinet that under the recentchange in the law, Maltese had become the language ofthe Maltese Courts, with English as a second string.It was a logical and necessary consequence that the instruction in Law at the University should be giveneither in Maltese or in English.    It was generally .recognised in Malta that this change of language inthe teaching of Law at the University would necessarily follow the change of language in the Courts.    In reply-to enquiries he assured the Cabinet that under the newlaw English had a preference over Italian in the Courts.The change should be made now, and it would be muchmore difficult, to make it if it was postponed, as theForeign Office suggested.   Moreover,  postponement wouldgive Italian sympathisers in Malta endless opportunityfor intrigue.    In this connection Sir John Maffey read to the Cabinet a letter which he had just received fromthe Governor of Malta, stating, inter alia, that theRector of the University feigns elf... a n.... It a Xiajaju favoured the proposed change.In the course of discussion it was pointed outarethat at present all the legal textbooks wou.44-fee in italian, and that there would be a practical difficultyin giving instruction in Maltese or English untilsuitable textbooks in those languages were available.It was also pointed out that the Legal Course in theUniversity was probably one of three years, and thatwhile there was much to be said for giving instruction to new entrants in Maltese or English, -it would, be reasonable to allow the present students to complete
mtheir Course in the language in which they had hitherto been taught.   The suggestion was also made that itmight he desirable for the Governor to authorise theGoverning Body of the University to make the changeif and when that Body thought desirable.While, on merits, the Cabinet thought that thecase of the Secretary of State for the Colonies wasvery strong, it. appeared to them that, having regard.to the delicate nature of our relations with Italyand. to practical considerations such as the probableabsence of suitable textbooks, it would not in anycase be practicable to give effect to the proposed change as from   October 1st next.    In the circumstances,and in view of the absence of the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies, the Cabinet agreed.  mo invite the Lord President of theCounci1 to confer with the Secretaryof State for the Colonies on his returnto London, and with the Secretary ofState for&apos;Foreign Affairs, with a viewto arriving at some compromise such ashad been suggested in the course of thediscus sion.
s land OP 3.      The Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsAMB.informed the Cabinet that there was an Island calledTamb in the middle of the Persian Gulf which the Persianshad always claimed as part of Persia but which infact belonged to an Arab ruler under British protection.In August and again in September a Persian sloopvisited the territorial waters of Tamb without givingnotice;    on the first occasion the Persian vesseloverhauled an Arab dhow in the roadstead.Standing instructions to the senior naval officerare to the effect that if the Persians attempt to occupy the Island they should be warned away and if necessaryrestrained by force.      These recent incidents seem toshow the intention on the part of Persia to build upa case for the Persian sovereignty over Tamb which we are bound to resist.Consequently, it was decided between the ForeignOffice, India Office and Admiralty:(a) to reaffirm and expand instructions toBritish ships in the Gulf so that they would givewarnings and if necessary take action if Persian vesselsattempt to exercise any jurisdictional act in theterritorial waters of Tamb;    and(b) to warn the Persian Government that these orders had been issued.Recently, however, both at Geneva and in london the Persian Government had been very emphatic in itsexpressions of a desire to settle all outstandingdifficulties with this country.      It had been thought,therefore,  better somewhat to revise the procedure and it was now agreed between the Departments that our minister at Tehran should read to the Persian PrimeMinister the draft note, informing him that this note -would have been delivered at once if it had not been for
recent Persian expressions of a great desire to reach agreement on all points, but that conversationscannot be undertaken if this sort of thing goes on.Sir R. Hoare would then warn the Persian Governmentthat, should such an event recur, instructionswould be issued and a note sent in.      A similarcommunication will be made to the Persian minister in London.The Cabinet approved the line proposedto be taken  by the Departments concerned as explained to them by the Secretaryof State Lor Foreign Affairs and summarised above.
9 Q Mit J %JAPAN. 4.    The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs drew the attention of the Cabinet to the factRelationswith, that in his first despatch after reachingPrevious Tokio, dated July 5th, Sir E. Clive, our newReference:Cabinet 10 (34)    Ambassador, had reported that in a conversationConclusion 2).with the Japanese Foreign Minister, Mr. Hirota3lt(3k)l, had said &quot;that Japan would be ready to conclude35 W].a non-aggression pact with Great Britain&quot;.      TheChancellor of the Exchequer had drawn attentionto this offer and the question was whether it wouldbe advisable to make any enquiry as to what Mr.Hirota may have meant.      In the view of the ForeignOffice it was very improbable that Japan would put forward any proposals which we could entertain,Slott )M^&quot; I   but/that it would be a very great mistake to refrain from making any further enquiries.      It must ofcourse be realised that the difficulties of reaching a bilateral agreement between Japan and GreatBritain were very great, but if these difficultiescould be surmounted the advantages to Great britain could hardly be overestimated.      He, the Secretaryof State, proposed,after such further consultationwitn the Chancellor of the Exchequer and other ministers concerned as might be necessary,  to instruct His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Tokioto ask Mr.  Hirota to develop nis proposal.&apos;The Chancellor of the Exchequer thoughtthat this proposal was so important both as regardsthe whole future policy of Great Britain and also of the Dominions that the Cabinet might, before reaching any final conclusion, like to have a detailed review of the whole problem.      This perhapsmight take the form of a  joint memorandum by himself and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,
9 Q rr*s .5 JsThe matter was urgent because we were about to engage on preliminary conversations with theJapanese in anticipation of the forthcoming naval conference.      The possibility of a bilateral pactsuch as Mr.  Hirota nad hinted at might have a very important bearing on the line which we were to t akein these preliminary discussions.      In view of thegreat advantages both to ourselves and to theDominions which would accrue from such a pact,it would in his view be undesirable to reach any final conclusions as to the line to be taken inthe naval discussions until the Cabinet had hadan opportunity of exhaustively examining the majorpoint.No useful purpose would be served oy limiting the proposed pact to an agreement not to r4sort to force.      Both ourselves and Japan were already bound by multilateral agreements of this kind.      A bilateralpact would of course be much more effective, and itw^uld be necessary to consider the circumstances which might fall to be dealt with under it.Clearly we could not contemplate giving Japan a freehand in China or in Shanghai or in the Dutch east indies or to do vihat she thought fit by way of aggression against the Soviet.        In the future wewere bound to be much concerned with the position ofChina.        It might be doubtful what the designs of japan on China were, but it was clear that if we areto preserve our own position in China we ought toact now.        He,  -ohe Chancellor of the Exchequer,assumed that if His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador spoke asproposed to Mr. Hirota he would have to indicatethat in any such pact we must have assurances thatour important interests will not be prejudiciallyaffected.
In the course of discussion     reference wasmade to the recent mission of Mr.  Lathamto Japan and to the probability that Australia andNew Zealand might be expected to be sympathetic towards a pact of the kind in contemplation.        It was also suggested that regard must be haa to the changed circumstances arising out of the entry of the Sovietinto the League of Nations and the approaching retire-men t of Japan from the League.The Cabinet agreed -(l)    To approve the proposal of the Secretaryof State tor Foreign Affairs that HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador in Japan should be instructed to invite the JapaneseForeign Minister to explain further his proposal that Japan would be ready to conclude a non-aggression pact withGreat Britain.(2)    To take note that the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs would circulate tothe Cabinet a memorandum on the Japanesesituation with reference to the questionof a non-aggressive pact.

The Cabinet were informed that Mr. NormanDavis    proposed to be present in London duringthe forthcoming discussions between the Britishand Japanese Delegations and that if necessaryhe could arrange to arrive in London before theJapanese.      It was pointed out that the Japanese had only agreed to these discussions on thedistinct understanding that they would be of a technical character and that politics would be excluded.        There was no more justification for the presence of a representative of the UnitedStates of America at the discussions than therewould have been for the presence of a Japaneseat the similar discussions between ourselves and the Americans.K,wgs agreed that an intimation should begiven to the Amerfe&amp;as to the effect that in viewof Japanese susceptibilitTes^^^wo^uld be necessary -that our conversations with the Japanese^dCLegation1
EGYPT .i-eviousef reference e:cabinet 4.54). Con-conclusion  6.)ft ft.6.    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP.-215(34)) on the subject of Egypt, in which he drew attention to the serious state of King Fuad&apos;s health and. the critical situation which might arise if hesuddenly died.    The Secretary of State&apos;s main point was that if King Fuad died and internal, trouble inEgypt was threatened, a great opportunity would be afforded for vindicating the claim to maintain ourpresence in Egypt.   He therefore submitted that instructions should be given, both to the necessaryDepartments at home and to the Acting High Commissionersuch as would, make ourselves ready for the eventualitywhich might occur.   In his Memorandum   the Secretaryof State formulated, for the consideration of the Gab-ineconclusions on the following lines:-(1) The abandonment for the time being of anyattempt to negotiate a political settlement in Egypt.   We should   pursue a policy ofbenevolent but not inactive opportunism,and,  in doing so,   ...(.2) Concentrate on the development of economic relations between the two countries with aview to bringing it home to the Egyptianpeople that their unescapable connexion withthe United Kingdom is of valuable materialbenefit.   As a concomitant of this, it isproposed to investigate carefully the possi-bility of concluding an Anglo-EgyptianCommercial Treaty .....(3) Authorise the High Commissioner to use his influence to bring about a betterment ofinternal political conditions in Egypt, withspecial reference to a more efficient administration of the country in the interestsof the people as a whole rather than of theprivileged few  .....(4) Authorise the High Commissioner to discuss with the Egyptian Government, as they arise,matters to&quot;which they attach importance,and particularly such immediate problemsas the reform of the Mixed Courts......(5) Accept the principle that, in the event ofthe death of the King of Egypt (or someother internal political crisis), it willbe the duty of the High Commissioner to .use his influence to secure a regency
(and/or Cabinet) acceptable both to thecountry and to His Majesty&apos;? Government,This would mean approval of the proposed,action outlined in the Acting High .Commissioner&apos;s despatch dealing with the developments which may be expected to occur on the death of King Fuad, with theadditional understanding that he may find it necessary to secure the immediateadjournment of Parliament after the reading of &quot;the King&apos;s nominees for the regency,and  .....(6) Authorise the High Commissioner to endeavourto ensure the maintenance of internal orderin the event of a political crisis causedby King Fuad&apos;s death by letting it be knownamong the political leaders that theDepartment of Public Security will, ifnecessary, be supported by British forces.Attached to CP.-215 (34) was a Memorandum by thePermanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsgiving a connected account of the recent course of anglo-Egyptian relations, and recent despatches onthe subject addressed to the Secretary of State bythe wigh Commissioner and the Acting High Commissioner.The Secretary of State for V/ar informed theCabinet that the War Office were in full agreementwith the proposals of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs.In reply to the Secretary of State for india the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs assured theCabinet that it was not contemplated that the HighCommissioner would use the authority under paragraph above to intervene in internal affairs in Egypt save in cases of major importance such as would justifythe intervention of the Government of India in the affairs of a important Indian State.The Cabinet agreed -To approve the proposals of the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs in regard to future policy in Egypt as summarised in conclusions 1 to 6 inclusive of CP. 215 (34),which Conclusions are for convenience ofreference set out above.

CHILDREN TOtt-INDUSTRIAL   by the Home Secretary, the Secretary of State forP10YMENTScotland and the Minister of Labour (CP.-S14 (34))entitled &quot;Age for Admission of Children to non-industrial employment&quot;.   The Memorandum stated that a decision was required as to the action to be taken regardingthe draft Convention and. Recommendation on this subjectadopted in April, 1932, at the Sixteenth Session ofthe International labour Conference.   After discussing the effect of the provisions of the Convention (0md,41l5)and the Recommendation, the above Ministers suggestedthat the best course to pursue in the circumstances would be to lay a White Paper stating that theproposals in the Convention in certain material pointsgo beyond, the law relating to the employment of schoolchildren in this country, which was reviewed by Par11a-ment as recently as 1938;    that the new law only came into operation on November 1,    19 33, and it is too soon to form any opinion as to how it will work in practice:and that the Government does not propose to take a finaldecision on the question of the ratification of theConvention, and of the enabling legislation which wouldbe required, but intends to keep the matter underconsideration for the time being.    As to the Recommenda-tion, the Ministers suggested, that the same action should, be followed as in the case of the Convention.The Cabinet approved the proposals ofthe Home Secretary,  the Secretary of Statefor Scotland and the Minister of Labouras set out in paragraphs 12 and 13 of cp.  214 (34) and summarised above.
GERMAN DEBTNEGOTIATIONS.[previous reference:Cabinet 27( 34), C on-concluslon 3.)9. The Cabinet had.before them the following documents on the subject of the German debt negotia-tions:-A Memorandum by the President of theBoard of Trade (CP.-216 (34))informing his colleagues of recent developments in Germany in connection- with the general exchange position andthe control of imports:Telegram No. 203 SAVING from Sir E, Phipps(Berlin) containing a.summary by sir frederick Leith-Ross of the positionreached to date (See.Appendix).   Atthe end of the summary Sir Fredericksaid that he proposed&quot; to continue thediscussions in Berlin until about Fridaynight and - then return to London toreport the whole situation and obtaininstructions as to policy.The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed theCabinet that since the receipt of telegram No.203from Sir Eric Phipps a telephone message had beenreceived from Sir Frederick Leith-Ross to the effectthat he had pressed the question of the frozen debtsand the Germans were maintaining that whatever was done in regard to these debts must be done inside and not outside the proposed clearing arrangement.The German officials seemed to regard clearing asthe only possible means of meeting these requirementswithout getting them into difficulties with othercountries, and were ready to explore the line of a clearing agreement .   The Sondermark Agreement had not hitherto worked successfully because the Britishimporter, who had always been accustomed to makingpayment in sterling, was proving reluctant to payingin Reichsmarks.    It seemed, therefore, that we mighthave to consider a clearing agreement,   There were,of course, several difficulties.   Such an agreementprobably could not properly operate for some months,during which fresh arrears of debts would, accumulate.
Secondly, it was doubtful if the Germans would accept an allocation which we would, regard as reasonable without much pressure.   As our hands were tieduntil January, such pressure could not immediately be brought to bear,&apos;and meanwhile frozen debts dueto British traders were bound to accumulate andBritish non-essential exports, such as coal andherrings, might be cut down, while Germany continuedto receive sterling counter-value of her importantChristmas export to us.Sir Prederich Leith-Ross was expected to returnto England on Friday, after which he (the Chancellorof the Exchequer) would probably ask the Cabinet toreach some decisions..   The Cabinet took note of this c omrounic a t i on.

The Minister - of Labour informed the Cabinetthat on the previous evening he had received, a communication from the Chairman of the unemployment assistance Board stating that it would be quite impossible for the Board to submit their draft regulations to the Cabinet before the end. of October.Accordingly the earliest date at which the draft regulations would be ready to lay before parliament would be the end of November.    Tn these   circumstances it was proposed that the First Appointed Day should,be the 7th.

Policy is to restrictnon-essential imports and Schacht refused any permanentassurance about coal or herrings.     By press declarationagreed today Germans undertake that until the end of Octoberpermits shall be issued for import of normal quantities ofall classes of United Kingdom goods with right to paythrough special account for goods covered by exchangeagreement.     This will (? apply to) coal for free ports andbunkers as well as quota-ed coal and herrings.     To this extent new exchange restriction will not affect british trade pending negotiations02.     The value of this arrangement to British tradedepends on possibility of liquidating special account.   Upto present Germans have used account to pay for british goods in reichsmarks while British importers have paid for much larger imports of German goods in sterling so thatthere is a constantly increasing balance of reichsmarksto ...
to be liquidated.     The special account itself hoIds fivemillion marks which under the agreement can. he liquidatedgradually by Bank of England:    a further ten million markshas since been tendered to Reichshank and represents atpresent book debt in blocked marks but will be transferredto-special account as and when existing balance in the account is disposed of.   Payment is not to be special accountthough it involves, as appears in present circumstances, best means of obtaining settlement for goods delivered and only means of obtaining settlement for non essential goods.Alternative would have been to leave United Kingdom trade tothe mercy of new German exchange plan which we think meanseliminating all except goods essential to Germany.     our objective must be to use account and render it liquid.   this can only be done by inducing British importers to settletheir debts for goods purchased from Germany in reichsmarks.If persuasion fails alternative will be to compel Britishimporters to pay sterling value of their purchases fromGermany to Bank of England which would then pay over reichS&quot;marks, equivalent to German exporters.     But as the Treasuryis advised this can only be done by action under debtsclearing offices act.3.     On frozen debts generally the German representativ-stake the line that their foreign exchange resources do not permit of any immediate settlement.     Schacht admits the justice of claim to payment and hopes that after a few weeks the new exchange regulations will give him larger freeforeign exchange resources out of which he can makeallocation for gradual liquidation of frozen debts.   But he made no commitment and the German officials have no suggestion beyond gradual liquidation through clearing.  .
5a4c     As regards permanent trade regime the German policyis to restrict all non-essential imports but they are readyto negotiate with us and other countries arrangements underwhich non-essential imports would continue to he admittedif thereby they are enabled to obtain facilities for ad-ditional exports.     On this basis they are prepared to con-template continuance British quota of coal imports (but notcontinuance of British bunkers and free port coal) inorder to retain benefits of last year&apos;s tariff concessions..Assuming that we are not prepared to give up exportinggoods which Germany considers non-essential and that weare not prepared to export them without payment wo musttry as*&amp; negotiate with Germany an arrangement which willsafeguard such exports.     As yet the Germans are not ready for such discussion but their general attitudedoes not encourage the hopes of agreement and I fear wehave little chance of protecting herrings and other exportsnon-essential to Germany except by threatening to shut outimportant German exports to the United Kingdom*     As wehave not the same controls as Germany this pressure canmost effectively be exerted through a clearing or any anyrate a threat of a clearing, whatever difficulties itentails seems the only means of forcing Germany to takeexports not essential to her and to pay for them.5o     The German officials seem to regard clearing asonly possible means of meeting these requirements withoutgetting them into difficulties with other countries and are ready to explore line of Cologne clearing agreements     Upto present I have not gone very far in this discussion butit does not appear that there will be much difference as   -to items which should be covered by a clearing.     The main difficulty
difficulty in negotiations will probably be that germans will want to be guaranteed, a substantial surplus fromclearing and to reduction of amount available for UnitedKingdom exports.     They would like to keep British re-export trade out of clearing and in return for a guaranteedsurplus they would undertake not to divert orders for rawmaterial from existing channels. - They value greatlyfacilities given by London market.6.     Apart from difficulty in harmonising German andBritish claims as to allocation of a clearing account thepractical difficulties of its administration must be care-fully considered,.     In my view the clearing ought to workall right after three months.     But at first payment intoaccount by Germany will almost certainly much exceed pay-ments into account by British importers.   From date of clearing every German importer will use account to purchasegoods from England paying in reichsmarks.     But every Germanexporter will do his utmost to secure payment in sterlingfrom British importers before clearing comes into force andwill no doubt offer liberal discount for direct sterlingpayment.     As most of the trade is conducted on basis of up to- three months&apos; credit there will be similar period of delay before clearing receives sterling lor current deliveriesand meanwhile sterling receipts will be wholly inadequate to meet British financial and trade claims.     Difficulty willbe increased if advance notice has to be given of intro-duction of clearing as will be almost inevitable.     question must be examined whether there is any way round this difficulty.Only
Only alternatives 1 can see are:-A. To get German agreement that no surplus at all should he paid to them during first few months and thatthey should continue to meet financial obligations out oftheir own resources.     It will obviously be difficult toget them to agree to thiSoB. To tell our exporters to restrict export toGermany till clearing collects sterling in normal amounts.Co     To advance sterling to clearing during first fewmonths and recoup the advance later on.7.     If His Majesty&apos;s Government accept principle ofa clearing detailed negotiations will take some time and Iam doubtful if Germans will accept.allocation which wewould regard as&apos; reasonable without much pressure.   As our hands are tied till January such pressure cannot be im-mediately brought to hear and meanwhile frozen debts dueto British traders are bound to accumulate and British nonessential exports such as coal and herrings may be cut downwhile Germany continues to receive sterling counter-valueof her important Christmas export to uso     I propose to con-tinue discussions until about Friday night and then returnto London to report the whole situation and obtain instruct-ions as to policy
