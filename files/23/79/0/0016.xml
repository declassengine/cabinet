imperial defence policy.[Defence Re-quirements ,Draft Reportof ministerial committee on disarmament.(previous reference:Cabinet 29(34), C on-c Ins ion 3.)tit. flu neural1.   The Cabinet had before them, a Most secret draft Report by the Ministerial Committee on Disarma-ment on the subject of Defence Requirements (C.P.-205(34)). circulated, by instructions of the Lord Presidentof the Council, in advance of approval by the ministerial Committee, owing to the length of theReport and the short time available for its consider-at ion.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he agreed with many of the premises in the Report as affecting the Navy, but the Conclusions appeared tohim inconsistent with those premises, more especiallyConclusion (16).    He himself had proposed to the ministerial Committee that the Naval ReplacementProgramme should be put forward/ but he had not intended his proposal to apply to deficiencies:    infact, the Deficiency Programme had. nothing to do withthe Naval Construction Programme.   The Admiralty feltthat they could, not postpone their deficiencies untilvthe normal time at which the Estimates were discussed.He recalled that the deficiencies had. arisen becausethe Navy Estimates had, year by year ever since theWar, been cut by the Treasury, who no doubt felt bound, to do so for reasons of public economy.   the consequence was that the Naval Construction programme had been carried out at the expense of other headings of the Estimates on which deficiencies had accumulated.The pos it ion had been bad enough, in the days of theTen-year Rule.    Since then the Cabinet had receivedthe somewhat alarming Report of the&apos; Defence Require-rcents Committee fC.P.-64 (34))&quot;.    the prospects of theNaval Disarmament Conference did not appear favourable:and the position as regards. Japan was disturbing,in view of the economic difficulties between the
two countries.   Moreover, the amount of money beingspent effectively (that is to say, excludingpensions) on their respective Navies by the twocountries was calculated to be  47,000,000 in thecase of Great Britain and  49,000,-000 in the caseof Japan.    Further, he gathered that Japan had10,000 more men in her Navy than the United Kingdom.All this greatly increased, the responsibilities ofthe First lord of the Admiralty,   As the result ofthe present Inquiry the Royal Air Force had. beengiven a greater increase in aircraft than it had asked, for,   The Army had had its deficiencies recog-nised in the Report,   The deficiencies of the Navy,however, were not recognised in the Report and were left to be agreed between the Chancellor of theExchequer and himself.    In some ways the situation had deteriorated, as the Treasury had challenged, the bases of our sea-power and the Admiralty programmesfounded on the results of the Naval Conferences.All this had happened without any discussion with thetechnical advisers of the Admiralty,   The Treasuryproposed, apparently, to alter the whole basis ofImperial Defence, in which the Dominion?, were closely concerned.   The defence of our Empire necessitatedas a minimum the maintenance of a one-Power standard.Our annual building programmes were formulated, andour existing deficiencies had. been calculated, withstrict reference to that standard.    If our building programmes could not be carried out, and. equallyif our deficiencies could not be made good, theone-Power standard could not be maintained.    If thatstandard were to be abandoned we could, not defend, theEmpire and we might as well, have no Navy at all.
Short of that standard the Admiralty would not know what to ask for, and the Chancellor&apos;of the exchequer could, not know what to give.   Consequently his intention was to put forward Estimates based on a one-Power standard, together with the deficienciesfor the existing Fleet as stated in paragraph 56 ofthe Draft Report of the Ministerial Committee.    If he/hip&apos; &apos;       ---were/to put forward his deficiencies/it might happenthat he would not know until perhaps January whetherthe Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed with him.That would be very late for him to come to theCabinet, especially as by that time the naval conference might at least be in its preliminarystages.   It was only fair, therefore, that he should -have some direction from the Cabinet giving him some basis before he put forward, his Estimates.   He pro-posed to try and negotiate with the Chancellor of theExchequer about deficiencies in October and, if theycould not. agree, to come to the Cabinet by the end ofOctober, so that if the Admiralty*s firmly-establishedbasis was to be altered, a new one could be laid downby the Cabinet, who would have to bear the responsi-bility for the risk.The Lord President of the Council agreed that less time had been devoted, to the discussion of theNavy than of the other Services .   In the circumstances he thought the First Lord. &apos;s proposal was a fair one.The Chancellor of the Exchequer had. not the slightest objection, but wished, to include theNaval Construction Programme as well as the NavalDeficiency Programme in the conversations.The First Lord agreed..The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested, that afurther sentence should be added to Conclusion (.16)to carry out this agreement (See Conclusion (a)below) .- -3-
The Cabinet then discussed the Draft Report indetail, and certain amendments were made which are recorded in the Conclusions below.   Apart fromthese amendments the following points were raised:-Paragraph 52.    The Secretary of State for Airdrew attention to the fact that arrangements werebeing made by the Air Ministry to provide aircraft for the defence of the Midlands and Northern Englandwithin eight years, but the Army *s share in air defence was not provided, for within that period.It would be much more satisfactory if this were done.    The point was not, perhaps, very importantat the moment, but he mentioned the matter in orderthat it need not be lost sight of.The Secretary of State for War did not dissent from the statement that the Army1s scheme was not complete in this respect.   He took this opportunityto warn the Cabinet that the Army was not in acondition to fight at the present time, and that under the programme now proposed it would not bein readiness until some unspecified date after 1938,when the deficiencies had been made good.   The reasonfor this was that the Chancellor of the exchequer could, not provide the money, so that the five-year programme had had to be cut down from . 40,000,000to  20,000,000.    The Cabinet would have to takethe responsibility for that, though of course he tookhis share.   He was anxious that his colleagues shouldbe under no misapprehension on the subject.Page 14, lines. I. and 2.   The First Lord of theAdmiralty suggested that the words &quot;at a total costestimated at  20,000,000&quot; should read &quot;at a totalcost on Air Votes estimated at  20,000,000&quot;.The Chancellor of the Exchequer asked theFirst Lord of the Admiralty not to press this point.
He understood that the question raised was whether some-expenditure in connection with the Fleet Air Arm should fallon Wavy v&quot;otes or Royal Air Force Votes.   The subject wasvery technical and he would prefer to discuss it direct withthe First Lord of the Admiralty.&quot;he First Lord of the Admiralty agreed, to this .Towards the end of the discussion the President of theBoard of Trade said that he had watched with growing alarm theposition of the Navy in this Inquiry.    In particular, hethought it would be inadvisable to communicate the Report tothe Prime Ministers of the Dominions, who were especiallyinterested, in the Navy and. who might form the impression that naval requirements were being overlooked.mhe Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs recalled,that the present Inquiry had originated at a Meeting of theCommittee of Imperial Defence on-November 9, 1933, whenrepresentatives of some of the Dominions had been present.At a later- Meeting, on May 31, 1934, the Prime Minister had told representatives of the Dominions that as soon as theCabinet- had reached their conclusions the Dominions would be .informed:    tut he and his colleagues had. felt that it was only right that representatives of the Dominions should be told,quite informally, what was happening, and that they should, be assured that before any big decisions were made they would, becalled into consultation.    Sir Maurice Fankey had already seenrepresentatives of the High Commissioners and, by authority ofthe Acting Prime Minister and himself, had made an advancecommunication to them about the Air Defence proposals.   Hethought that the Cabinet were bound to make some communication to the Dominions, and. probably to send both the defence requirements Committee&apos;s Report- and the Report -of the Ministerial 10ommittee,Some discussion took place on this proposal,and it was felt that if would be liable to causemisunderstanding to send, the Report now about to be
approved, for the reason that it did not deal withthe Navy, in which the Dominions were principallyinterested.    In the c ire-urns tances , a suggestion wasadopted that Sir Maurice Hankey, on the occasion ofhis forthcoming visit to the Dominions, should take with him copies of the two Reports and make a state-ment to the Prime Ministers about the general resultsof the Inquiry up to date and its present position,bearing in mind the discussion at the Cabinet andmore especially the extreme importance of secrecy.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the Most Secret Draft Reportof the Ministerial Committee (CP,-205(34-)), subject to the following altera-tions:-Paragraph 5 to read as follows:-&quot;We are of opinion that theCabinetTs decision of the 14thMarch, as interpreted by the explanations quoted above, stillholds good, in respect of our long-range defence policy, and.in this Report we have not over-looked, this aspect of the case&quot;.Paragraph 21, line 10: Delete fromthe words &quot;detailed examination&quot;to the end. of the paragraph, and substitute the following:-&quot;The Committee were attracted by this proposal and examined,it in detail, but in existing international conditions it wasnot found possible to proceed,with it-&quot;Paragraph 30.. line 2: For &quot;anti-aircraft defence&quot; put &quot;air defence&quot;.Paragraph 39. line 8: For &quot;Belgium&quot;put &quot;France or Belgium&quot;.Paragraph 4.7: The second sentence should read as follows:-&quot;His proposal was to bring downadditional     the total/expenditure on the deficiency programmes in thefive-year period from  76.8millions involved, in the defence requirements Committee&apos;s programme to  50.3 millions&quot;.Paragraph 56, penultimate line:  &quot;1940&quot;should, read &quot;1942&quot; .
Paragraph 57: The opening words,&quot;The latest Adm ir a It ys s t ima t e&quot;should read &quot;The Admiraltyforecast&quot;.Page 9. Conclusion 16:    Add thefoilowing s entence:-&quot;Both the Naval construction programme and the NavalDeficiencies Programme w111be considered by the FirstLord of the Admiralty andthe Chancellor of the exchequer in the early Autumn, and theresults will be reported tothe Cabi.net not later than theend of October.&quot;(b) That the communication of the Reportto the Prime Ministers of the dominions should be postponed until decisions have been taken as to the Naval Defici-ency Programme:(c) That the Secretary to the Cabinet, onhis forthcoming visit to South Africa,Australia, New Zealand and Canada,should take with him copies of thetwo Reports and make a statement tothe Prime Ministers about the generalresults of the Inquiry up to date andits present position, bearing in mind the discussion at the Cabinet and moreespecially the extreme importance of secrecy.(NOTE:    A copy of the Summary of conclusions and Recommendations as approved bythe Cabinet is attached in theAppendix.)The Lord President of the Council appealed..tohis colleagues, to use the utmost discretion, inregard to the discussion that had just taken place,as itt was vitally important that no leakage should,occur in this very secret matter.
REDUCTION AND IMITATION OFARMAMENTS .(previous reference&apos;Cabinet 27(34), Con-elusion 5.)33(?lt)l.2.   The Secretary of Stats for Foreign affairs said that he and the Lord Privy Seal would, before long, be entering again on discussions on Disarmament,[put he did not ask for any decisions from the Cabinetthat da;;.
METROPOLITANPOLICE.Housing and.Building.(previous reference:Cabinet 22(53), Con-clusion 1.)1+3(31*)/**3.      Tlie Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Home Secretary (C.P.-207 (34)) summarisingproposals by the Commissioner of Police of the metropolis in his Annual Report, 1933, for thegeneral re-housing of the Force in order thatLondon&apos;s police buildings should be brought up to modern standards and be made worthy of the capital of the Empire and. of the position occupied by theMetropolitan Police, while at the same time promotingcontentment and efficiency among the men and facili-tating the transaction of business with the public.The expenditure involved, in the whole building programme was estimated at between  4,000,000 and 5,000,000, of which  4,000,000 would have to beprovided for on a loan basis.    The Commissioner had.urged that the scheme should, be planned as one to becompleted in six or seven years, and the HomeSecretary agreed that this should be the aim..    Forthis purpose a Bill conferring fresh borrowing powerson the Receiver for the Metropolitan Police Districtwould, be necessary, and the Home Secretary asked theapproval of the Cabinet to the introduction of sucha Bill in the Autumn.   A Bill on the lines he proposed would give general publicity to the matterand enable objections, whether to the policy of borrowing or on any other grounds, to be heard and considered before the whole scheme was actuallyembarked upon.The Chancellor of the Exchequer askedfor an assurance that the improvements would onlybe allowed out of capital which were of a permanentcharacter.The Home Secretary gave this assurance.The Chancellor of the Exchequer then asked that the improvements should not be on such a scale
as would invite demands for a higher standard fromother Government Departments.The Home Secretary thought he could give this undertaking also.The Lord President of the Council suggestedthat the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s points werecovered by the fact that a Bill would have to toeDrought before the Cabinet when details could toeconsidered.The First Commissioner of Works referred toa suggestion on page 5 of the Memorandum on the subjectof the extension of Hew Scotland Yard.      He gathered that the extension might affect Richmond Terrace.There were difficulties about the removal of thepresent occupants of Nos. % and U Richmond Terrace,but in addition it was very undesirable to mutilatethis Terrace which as a whole formed an object ofarchitectural interest.The Home Secretary agreed to discuss the matter&apos;with the First Commissioner of &quot;forks, but he was underthe impression that the proposed extension would bringHew Scotland Yard close to Richmond Terrace but wouldnot involve pulling it down.Subject to the undertakings given by theHome Secretary to the Chancellor of the Exchequer,the Cabinet agreed -(a) That the Home Secretary should have authority to prepare a Bill.(d) That the plans for the proposed extensionof Hew Scotland Yard should be agreed between the Secretary of State for HomeAffairs, the First Commissioner of works and the Commissioners of Crown Lands.
(fOTTSTM? POLICY,glum Clearanceand Housing.I (previous reference:Cabinet 8(34), Con-elusion 7.)4.    The Cabinet had before them a IKemorarrfhain&quot;toythe Minister of Health (CP,-208 (34)) bringingdirect to the Cabinet, after consultation with theLord President of the Council, instead of to theHousing Policy Committee, a matter affecting negotia-tions with the Housing Authorities on the new housing bill.    One of the recommendations contained in theReport of the Cabinet Committee (CP.-46 (34)) was as follows:-&quot;That as regards * overcrowding and re-development&apos; the offer of financialassistance from the Exchequer shouldbe strictly limited to cases where therehousing is effected on or near thecentral site by means of blocks offlats and should not be given in caseswhere the rehousing is effected, bymeans of ordinary small houses erectedon undeveloped, land on the outskirts of the area of the local authority&quot;.In subsequent discussions the Local Authorities laidspecial emphasis on the claim that there should befinancial assistance for rehousing in cottages, andthe Minister of Health felt that assistance should begiven in special cases, of which he gave examples.He proposed, to deal with the matter on the following basis, in which the Chancellor of the Exchequer hadconeurred:-That no general subsidy will be givenfor cottage building.That in the special cases referred to,it will be open to the authority inrespect of a. particular scheme, toproduce evidence that, for such reasonsas those stated, a subsidy is necessary.It would, then be for the Minister todecide, subject to Treasury approvalas to conditions, whether the claimhad been made out. or not, and. to allowsubsidy if necessary, subject to areasonable maximum, and. to a rate contribution.
The Secretary of State for Scotlandwarned the Cabinet that the proposals did not meetthe needs of Scotland which were somewhat different.He was in correspondence with the Chancellor of theExchequer on the subject.      He gave particulars.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recognisedthat conditions in Scotland differed from those inEngland in this matter.The Minister of Health said his Bill wouldbe in draft by the middle of September.The Cabinet agreed -(a) To approve for England the proposals ofthe Minister of Health as set forth in cp.  208 (34)  and summarised above.(b) To take note that the arrangements forScotland were under consideration be-tween the Secretary of State for Scotlandand the Chancellor of the Exchequer.-12-
$3 MEATITUATION.egotiations.th . theIjominions.reviousef erence:cabinet 28 (34)conclusion 7).Of Mo,5.    The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs reported that he and the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries had seen the Dominion High Commissionerson the 27th July and informed them of the programmeof meat shipments to the United Kingdom from theDominions which the United Kingdom Government considered to be necessary during the six months July to December,1934, i.e.  the first two-thirds of the period in whicha subsidy is &quot;being paid out of the United kingdom excequer to the United Kingdom producers of beef.He had made it plain to the High Commissioners thatthis programme was one which the United Kingdom Govern-jment had decided to adopt and that it was not a-I;suggested programme for discussion.The High Commissioners had shown no disposition to challenge the figures which they evidently regardedas prima facie satisfactory to them.        They pressed,however, that rather than present all Dominions with ajoint programme covering all Dominions, separatecommunications should be addressed to each Dominionin the form of inviting the Dominion Government toco-operate by regulating their exports of meat to theUnited Kingdom on the scale which we had laid down for each case.      He made it clear that he had noobjection to putting the matter in this form or in anyother form that was desired so long as it was clearly understood that we expected that the arrangements setout would in fact be accepted by Dominion Governments.After the meeting with the High Commissioners,a Committee of departmental officers, including representatives of the Dominions, at once met in orderto draw up the actual texts of separate communications to each Dominion.     As a result, telegrams wereJ
despatched on the evening of the 27th July to each dominion with the exception of Australia, the telegram to which was deferred until the 28th Julyat the request of Mr. Bruce.      (In the case ofCanada, a telegram was sent from the Canadian HighCommissioner to his Government).Copies of these telegrams have teen circulatedand also copies of supplementary telegrams toour representatives in Canada, Australia and theUnion of South Africa.Telegrams received that morning from Australiaand New Zealand indicate that these dominions were not in favour of any restrictions.      TheGovernment at Ottawa were greatly concerned overthe situation and anxious that if possiblepublication of the despatch should be deferred until they had had an opportunity of making representations.        South Africa had adopted afavourable attitude.      It appeared possible thatwhen the Governments of the Dominions receivedthe messages from their High Commissioners theymight see the desirability of modifying theirattitude.      After March permanent arrangements would have to come into operation.      In the meantime,officials were to meet on the subject.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheriespaid a tribute to the skill with which theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs had handledthis question.
THE SOUTHAFRICAN HIGHCOMMISSIONTERRITORIES .Transfer tothe Union ofSouth Africa,(previous reference:Cabinet 62(33), Con-clusion 8.)106.      The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs (C .P.-197(34)) covering further correspondence with general hertzog on the question of the transfer of SouthAfrican High Commission Territories (Easutoland,the&apos;-Bechuanaland Protectorate and Swaziland) to theUnion of South Africa.    In summing tip the presentposition the Secretary of State had written that theGovernment still maintained the view that the moment was not opportune for raising this question, butthat the closest association and oo-operation,particularly on economic matters, would be welcomed.At the suggestion of the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs the Cabinet only took: note ofthe above Memorandum.-15-

These approaches had not led to very muchresult.      The main point of interest was that his suggestions had awakened no    violent reaction againstthe proposal that the Police should be permitted toenter meetings on the decision of the Chief Constable.The Opposition Liberals had adopted a somev/hat nervousattitude towards the proposals, and Sir Herbert Samuelhad suggested that those relating to private armiescould not be applied in practice.      The Labour party had been r ather shy of dealing with meetings in thevicinity of offices of public authority and labour exchanges, but had rather welcomed proposals fordealing with private armies.      In fact, Sir StaffordOripps had asked if he could assure people in public speeches that the Government had decided to act.The Home Secretary had replied that this was only aconsultation and that no decision had been taken.Some of the Opposition Liberals had been in favour ofdealing with private armies and interference withmeetings.      Mr.  Lloyd George had sent a message to theeffect that the Government were making rather too muchof private armies which would in due course die a natural death.The Lord President of the Council said that the gist of the report was that nothing much had come ofthese conversations and that the Government would haveto make up its own mind on the matter.

APPENDIX.Defence Requirements.Report by Ministerial Committee.SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS.Our Conclusions and recommendations may be summarised as follows :  hong-Range Policy.(i) Subject to the explanations in paragraph 4, our long-range defence policycannot be founded exclusively on a basis that may prove temporary and shifting and must be susceptible to adaptation to meet changes^   in the international situation.   (Paragraph 5.)Immediate Policy.(2) Our foreign policy must continue to be directed towards the promotion of a stable peace throughout the world and the reduction and limitation of armaments. But, at the moment, no developments ofthis nature can be foreseen which would enable us to avoid there-equipment of our defence forces.   (Paragraphs 8 and 49.)(3) For the present, the expenditure of the Defence Departments should be governed by the defence of our possessions and interests in the far east; European commitments; and the defence of India. Noi expenditure need be incurred on measures of defence requiredexclusively against attack by the United States of America, france or Italy, provided that defences are not allowed to fall so far behindthat it will be impossible to bring them up to a suitable standardin time to meet changes in the political situation. (Paragraphs 4and 6.)Imperial Defence-The Far East.(4) In the Far East we should continue our efforts to secure a permanentfriendship with Japan. Pending the fruition of this policy, and inany case steps must be taken to remedy the very serious weakness of our defensive position in this region (paragraph 11): This is amatter of the first importance from the point of view of ImperialDefence policy and is essential to the security of the British empire in&apos; the Far East.   (Paragraph 13.)(5) On merits, therefore, so far as financial exigencies allow, we ought to aim at the following :-(i) The completion of our worst naval deficiencies;(ii) Proceeding with the approved programme for the completion ofthe Singapore naval base and the first stage of the defences;(iii) Completion of the defence of Hong Kong;&apos;(iv) Completion of the defence of other fuelling stations in the far east.   (Paragraph 17.)&apos;Measures for securing Peace in Europe.(6) Whatever may be the result of the efforts now in progress to promotesecurity in Europe, His Majesty&apos;s Government should not be deterred from seeking fresh opportunities to promote peace and bring aboutthe reduction or at least the limitation of armaments.   In the mean-[10354a]
time, in view of the accumulating evidence that Germany has started to rearm in earnest, it would be unsafe to delay the initiation of stepsto provide for the safety of the country.   (Paragraph 26.)Home Defence: Europe.(7) The Low Countries (Belgium and Holland) are vital to our security fromthe point of view of both naval and air defence, and in the opinion ofthe Governments technical advisers can only be defended by theprovision of military forges to co-operate with other countries concerned. Of the two, Belgium is. the, more liable to attack in any-future Franco-German war., Holland also, however, cannot be excluded from . liability to attack, particularly as the French and belgian frontier defences are developed, though there are strong reasons which might deter Germany, as in the late war, from violatingDutch territory.   (Paragraph 34, and Appendix III, paragraph 2.)(a) .4 rmy Requirements.(8) On merits, we should aim at a reorganisation of the existing ArmyExpeditionary Force, on the lines proposed by the Defence Require-ments Committee; that is to say, it should be equipped for war indifferent parts of the world, including, if necessary, the continent of Europe. Together with the appropriate Air Forces this wouldprovide an essential element in a plan of co-operation with other nations for the defence of the Low Countries, but we should have to contemplate reinforcement from the Territorial Army as soon aspracticable.   (Paragraphs 31 and 35.)(b) Air Requirements.(9) On merits, Air Forces considerably in excess of those recommended by theDefence Requirements Committee are required. For details, see conclusion (14) below, which covers the Fleet Air Arm and oversearequirements, as well as Home Defence.*(c) Political Requirements.(10) Arising out of Conclusion (7) above, the requirements of the defence services for Home Defence rendered desirable the Declaration madeby the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in the House ofCommons on the 13th July on the subject of the vital importance ofBelgium to the interests and safety of this country. In order to givepractical effect to a policy of giving assistance to Belgium, it wouldbe necessary to concert arrangements beforehand with other powers concerned. This, however, is not proposed at present. (Para-graphs 39-44.)Defence of India.(11) If the deficiencies to meet our European commitments are made good, therequirements of the Defence of India can be met.(12) The Government of India should be urged to expedite the work ofcorrecting their worst deficiencies as a complement to our own efforts.This should include bringing up to date the defences of Indian ports in accordance with plans already drawn up, which is essential tocomplete our defensive arrangements in the Far East. (Para-graph 45.)The Programme.(13) Our Defence position ought to be kept constantly under review, and theprovisional and tentative programme recommended should be adjustedfrom time to time in the light of new factors in the situation. Inparticular, the Chancellor of the Exchequer will not bind himself or his successors to find the additional sums mentioned in this Reportwithin five years or in the particular years to which they are allotted.(Paragraph 50 (a) (5).)
The Royal Air Force.(14) Parliamentary considerations necessitated our submitting an InterimReport on Air Defence requirements (Schedule 1). The decision ofthe Cabinet, the substance of which was announced in the House ofCommons on the 19th July, may be summed up as follows :  Subject to the provisions of Conclusion (13) 41^* new Squadrons of the Royal Air Force, including 33  Squadrons for Home Defence, - ----   -4^* Squadrons for the Fleet Air Arm.       -     -.-&apos;--&quot;        3  Squadrons for Singapore, - ...1  Squadron for the Far East, exclusive of Singapore,the above to be provided in 1934, and the four ensuing years at a totalcost estimated at  20,000,000.The Admiralty and Air Ministry to concert experiments intraining one or two Squadrons from the Fleet Air Arm and the HomeDefence Air Force respectively to undertake a dual role, and to reporton the result to the Committee of Imperial Defence within two years;the two Departments also to examine the question of inter-changeability in all its aspects, including that of design of aircraft.The aircraft required for the Cruisers of 1933 to 1936Programmes to be provided at dates which should be settled by arrangement between the First Lord of the Admiralty and theSecretary of State for Air, subject to the agreement of the Chancellorof the Exchequer.The decision as to the destination of the Squadron for the far east, apart from Singapore, to be postponed until the Committee ofImperial Defence, advised by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee, hasbeen consulted.The Committee of Imperial Defence will also examine thepossibility and advisability of providing landing grounds at HongKong, Penang, Ceylon ports and Aden, with a view to a possiblescheme of emergency reinforcements if, when the emergency arises,aircraft can be made available from elsewhere.   (Paragraph 50.)The Army.(15) Subject to the provisions of Conclusion (13) above a sum of  20,000,000should be allotted to the Army to be spread over 1934 and the foursubsequent years in accordance with the programme submitted by theSecretary of State for War (Schedule 2). This programme makes provision for completing the first stage of the Singapore defence scheme and for progress being made on the defence of other ports east of Suez by the year 1938-39; for a relatively small expenditure onMediterranean and Home ports; for the completion of the existing scheme of air defence, so far as the War Office are concerned, by1939-40, but not for the expansion of the existing scheme to cover theMidlands and Northern England.  12,000,000 is provided for theRegular Expeditionary Force, leaving  15,500,000 to be providedafter 1938-39 in order to complete requirements on the scale proposedby the Defence Requirements Committee. For the Territorial Armyit has only been found possible to provide a very small sum. (Para-graphs 51-53.)The Navy.(16) While recognising the paramount importance of the Navy as the shieldof the whole Empire and of its vital seaborne communications, we find it impossible, in present circumstances, to recommend a long-range* See footnote to paragraph 50.
naval replacement programme, owing to the uncertainties introduced by the forthcoming International Naval Conference.   In the circum-stahces we recommehu that both the Naval&apos; Construction programme and the Naval Deficiencies Programme for next year should be putforward and considered in the normal1 way between the Admiralty andthe Treasury (with reference to the Cabinet in case of difference), andthat subsequent programmes should be left undecided pending theimportant decisions which will have to be made, in the forthcomingInternational Naval Conference.   (Paragraphs 55-62.)   Both theNaval Construction programme and the Naval Deficienc-ies Programme will he considered by the First Lord ofthe Admiralty and the Chancellor of the Exchequer inthe early Autumn, and the results will be reported tothe Cabinet not later than the end of   October.o
