REDUCTION ANDLIMIT AT ION - of armaments.(previous reference:Cabinet 14( 34) , C on-clusion 2.)1. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that the French Note had arrived that morning.All the inspired accounts in the Press, though theyvaried considerably, had proved right, that the reply was not satisfactory.   He recalled that the BritishMemorandum on Disarmament had been dated January 29th.This had been followed by Mr Edenfs visits to Berlin,Rome and Paris, &quot;between February 17th and March 1st.The first French Note had been received on March 17th.That led us to put two questions to the FrenchGovernment: -(l) Supposing it were found possible for agreement to be reached on guarantees of execution of the proposed A:Convention,whether the French Government would beprepared to accept as the basis of suchConvention the United Kingdom Memorandumof January 29th as modified by certain proposals&quot; made by Herr Hitler?(2)  If so, what is the nature of the guarantees of execution which theFrench Government would propose?Lord Tyrrell at first reported his impression that we were going to get a helpful answer.    In fact,we received an interim Note so obscure that theSecretary of State had agreed with the french ambassador that it should not be published and thatwe should await the final Note.   Lord Tyrrell, recog-recognising the obscurity, asked us to exercise patienceand still hoped for a useful outcome.   Now that theFrench Note had arrived it proved the reverse ofhelpfi.il.   What had happened evidently was that thepublication of the German Estimates for re-armamenthad hardened opinion in the French Government, or at any rate was   being used by the &quot;die-hards&quot; to resist the invitation we made to them.    In thisconnection the Secretary of State drew attention toSir Eric Phipps&apos;  telegram No.88 of April 16th, report--ing the experiences in Paris of the French ambassador in Berlin.
The French Note, the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs continued, declined to contemplatere-armament of Germany accompanied by guarantees of execution of an agreement.   The Note contends thatthe behaviour of Germany in announcing re-armamentwhether there is agreement or not renders impossiblenegotiations on such a basis.   He then read thefollowing translation of an extract from the Note:-&quot;Before even enquiring whether anagreement could be reached on asystem of guarantees of executionfor a convention legalising Germanre-armament, France must put in the forefront of its preoccupations theconditions of her own security from,which, moreover, she does not separate,the security of other interested Powers.The return of Germany to the league ofNations was a condition insisted upon by both Prance and Britain and wouldbe indispensable to realise a satis-factory system of guarantees of execution&quot;, yet Hitler is not preparedto promise this .    It is an essential and necessary condition.   consequently the French Note regrets that thenegotiations pursued by France andE r 11 a in ha, ve been so r ought ly br ok e nby German action.    There is nothing to be done but to invite the Disarma-ment Conference to take up its workaRain.&quot;Continuing, the Secretary of State commented thathis first question was answered in the negative.The undercurrent of the Note was that guarantees for the Convention were not sufficient, and that theonly way in which progress might be made was bymeans of provision for security in the wider sense of the term.    That was what the French Governmentprobably meant by taking the question up again atGeneva.    It was not true, however, as stated in someorgans of the Press, that the French Note asked, interms for military guarantees.    The general form andargument of the Note was much superior to that ofrecent French Notes.   He proposed to announce inParliament the same day that the Note had beenreceived and that he hoped to issue a White Paper
possibly in the course of the evening.   He foresawno difficulty in obtaining French approval to publication. (See Paris telegram No.75, of April17th.)    The White Paper would contain a Note handed,by the American Government to the Secretary-Generalof the League of Nations:    the French Memorandum toGermany:    the Italian Memorandum:    the German answer to France:    the French Memorandum of March 17th:a Memorandum by the Small Powers:    a statement ofthe German view:    his own Note to the French Ambassadorasking the two questions mentioned above:    and. thefinal French Note received that morning.Some discussion took place as to the advisability of including the French Note of December 15th to thePresident of the Disarmament Conference on the subjectof guarantees .    On the whole, it was felt better notto inslude that Note.   The new White Paper would forma very complete sequence of documents built up on,     .      ^ , ., Memorandum,the basis of the British y        of January 29th, andit was suggested that if the earlier French Notewere included it would expose the Government to questions as to whether they agreed with the french proposal.   The French Note to Mr Henderson might,however, be used in Debate, when it could be pointedout that the Memorandum of January 29th had. beenput forward with that in mind.The Cabinet agreed  -(a) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should be authorised to publish a White Paper, on the lines indicated above,as soon as possible:(b) That the White Paper should not includethe French Government&apos;s Note of December15th, 1933, addressed to the Presidentof the Disarmament Conference:(c) That the Ministerial Committee on disarmament should meet on Thursday,April 19th, at 11-30 a.m.,, in thePrime Minister&apos;s Room at the Houseof Commons, primarily to cons ideu
the latest French Note on Disarmament.If time permitted, the Committee couldresume discussion on the Prime Minister&apos;sMemorandum (D.0.(m)(32) 98),-4-
2. The Cabinet had before them the following documents on the subject of the next Imperial Con-ferenceA Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs (0 .P.-105 (34)).at the end of which he suggested that,the Prime Minister might send an informalmessage to the Dominion Prime Ministersproposing a meeting of the ImperialConference next year and inviting theirviews as to the most convenient time of year for its assembling.   Concurrentlythe Secretary of State for India mightsound the Government of India.     He-thought the wisest course would be toinclude also the Irish Free State inany general approach made to theDominions:A Memorandum by the President of theHoard of Trade (CP.-108 (34)) in whichhe stated that from a commercial pointof view he found it difficult to think of an agenda for such a Conference whichwas not fraught with considerable danger to British interests.   He proposed 19 37as the date to be aimed at, when in anycase there must be some discussion withthe Dominions as the Ottawa agreements would then expire,In the course of the discussion the followingarguments were adduced in favour of the holding   of an imperial Conference next year.    1935 would be the 25th. anniversary of King George V&apos;s Accession to the &quot;Tirone.The Prime Ministers of the Dominions would in all probability be Invited to take part in any celebrationsheld to express public thankfulness for the King&apos;sreign, and discussion of Imperial matters could hardly be avoided.   There had. never been a period exceeding three or four years between Imperial Conferences.The European position, and especially the position ofthe League of Nations, would in the near futurenecessitate full and frank discussion with representa-tives of the Dominions,    On such matters discussionwith the High Commissioners was less satisfactorythan with the Prime Ministers.   There was a good deal to be said from our aide as to the way the dominions had. executed the Ottawa Agreements, and in any eventquestions relating to meat and dairy produce had to be
considered in the near  nature.   The life of thepresent Parliament would, come to an end in 1936,which seemed to indicate a General Election in thatyear.    If the Conference were not held, in 1935 itcould not be held until 1937.    The National Government.......ought not to allow so long an interval betweenImperial Conferences.The arguments against a Conference in 19 35 were that the political questions referred to above couldnot be discussed, without economic questions being raised.    On the whole, however, time was on our side in these matters, and the discussion of economic questions was undesirable.   The Conference wouldprovide an opportunity for extremists in this countryand in the Dominions to work up agitation for theirviews,    Prom the point of view of the Indian ottawa agreement, a Conference in 1935 was undesirable.We had twice done better with India than we had hoped,namely, at Ottawa and in the Legislative Assembly.It would, be better to leave the situation where   itwas, in order to give time for vested interests to grow up in India which would be strong enough to resist a change.   Moreover, next year the Secretaryof State for India,ami the India Office and theGovernment of India would be deeply involved, inConstitutional problems and would not have time tomake proper preparation for the Conference,The Cabinet agreed  That a Cabinet Committee, composed as follows-The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs (in the Chair),The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Secret-airy of State for India,The Secretary of State for the Colonies,The Secretary of State for War,The President of the Board of Trade,The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries(each Minister having the right tosend a representative if unable
to be present in person) -should consider the question of thedate of the next Imperial Conferenceand report to the Cabinet.-7-
I HE INDIANLEG IS LAT TV!ASSEMBLY.[Question of holding Blec-ftions in theAutumn orExtend ingjits Life.;(Pr previous- Reference:I Cabinet 4(54), Con-clusion 22.)3. The Secretary of State for India raised as amatter of urgency the question of whether the lifetime of the Central Assembly in India should be endedthis yead (namely, in November or December) or extended for another year.    He recalled that lastvear its lifetime had been extended for a, year andthat the problem was somewhat similar today, withthe difference that he took an opposite view fromthat of the Government of India on the question.The Government of India thought that a further postponement would be a mistake.   They consideredthat it would give the impression that the Governmentwas afraid lest- Congress, who were about- to returnto co-operation, would win too great a success .There was little doubt that Congress would do wellin a General Election this year, which would be agood moment from their point of view.   The Governmentof India was strongly pressing that an Elect ion-should be held.    mhe Secretary of State himself took the other view.    He had impressed, on the Governmentof India that if the Elections in India went badlyit would greatly embarrass the PTome Government in introducing the Indian Bill and would provide the opponents of that measure with very strong arguments&apos;in fact, it might react seriously on the prospects of passing the Bill.    In the previous year the decisionhad been taken to postpone the Elections both in thecentre and in the Provinces for a year owing to the uncertainty of the. situation.   No objection had been raised to this course.    That case was now stronger than ever.   The Government of India maintained,however, that if the Elections were postponed, itwould strengthen Congress .   In reply to the PrimeMinister the Secretary of State said that an announce-ment on the subject mustyjbe made within a fortnight.
The situation next year ought to be rather easier,as by April, 1955, the Government would know the fate of the Indian&apos;Bill.    Further announcementswould then have to be made.The President of the Board of Education, as a former Viceroy, pointed out that even a year hencewe should be a long way from reaching the positionwhen federation could be put in operation in India,as a great deal would still remain to be done afterthe passage of the Bill.   Consequently there would still be a considerable gap, and difficult questionsmight arise as to whether that was to be filled by further prolongation of the life of the Assembly or bya new Election.   At the end of the Meeting, however,he accepted the view of the Secretary of State forIndia in favour of postponing the Elections.The Secretary of State for India agreed, that itwould take a considerable time after the&apos; passage ofthe Bill before federation was put in operation.There would first have to be negotiations with theIndian Princes, which might take a long time,   he agreed that from this point of view it would be quite possible to have Elections now.   The realpoints at issue were the Government of India&apos;s viewthat postponement would strengthen Congress:    thefact that in the course of the Elections there wouldbe a great deal of criticism of the Government&apos;scheme:    and the reaction of those criticisms onthe    fate of the Bill in England.The Prime Minister pointed out that oppositionto the Bill in Elections taking place in India ayear hence might be embarrassing and dangerous.The Secretary of State for India thought that once the Bill was passed the Indian Princes andthe^Indians would try and work it.   An Election in
the Autumn, however, would result in increasingthe opposition to the Bill at home.The Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary of State forIndia should telegraph to theGovernment of India the strongview of the Cabinet that in theinterests o&quot;p the legislation tobe passed in this country it was essential that the Elections tothe Indian Central Legislative Assemblyshou.ld. not take place during thepresent year.-10-
JAPANESE 4. The Cabinet had before them the Report of theTRADE CON-PET TTTON.        Cabinet Committee on Japanese Trade CompetitionReport of        (C.P.-106 (54)), which had been set tip at the MeetingCabinet-Committee,       referred to in the margin to consider from all points of view the economic and political consequences(previous reference: involved in the breakdown of the negotiations betweenCabinet 10(54), Con-    united Kingdom and Japanese cotton and rayon indus-clusion 6.)trial is-&quot;s.    After surveying the question in all its aspects the Committee submitted the following con-clusions and recommendations to the Cabinet:-(1) We doubt whether, in their present frame of mind, the Japanese are prepared tomake any concessions of substance, andwe do not think, therefore, that any useful purpose would be served in makinga proposal to the Japanese Governmentwith a view to seeking an agreed basis for subsequent negotiations.(2) We recommend the Cabinet to adopt theonly alternative policy, namely, thatthe Japanese Government should be informedthat there- has been no indication, eitherduring the industrial di.scti.ssions or now,that they or their industries are pre-pared to make concessions of a kind whichwould make it possible to conclude anagreement;    His Maiestyfs Governmenthave therefore come reluctantly to theconclusion that no useful purpose willbe served by pursuing the discussionsfurther, and they are therefore obligedto resume liberty of action.(5)  If the Cabinet adopt the proposal in (2)above, we recommend that the Secretaryof State for the Colonies should beauthorised confidentially to arrangeforthwith with the various Colonialauthorities concerned for the institu-tion of a quota system which will notin form be discriminatory against Japan,except in the West African Colonies, andthat at the appropriate moment the JapaneseGovernment should be notified as in (2)above.(4) That the Secretary of State for the colonies should be authorised to secure the adoptionof a quota, system in Ceylon by the use ofthe Governor&apos;s power to legislate in mattersof &quot;paramount importance&quot; if this should prove necessary owing to the refusal of theLegislative Council to accept such a system.(5) To take note that the Treaty position inregard to East Africa is being examined bythe Departments concerned, and that theCommittee propose to submit a further Reporton the subject in due course.
In the course of the discussion the cabinet were reminded that in considering the question ofImperial Defence the trend of their opinion had beenin favour of doing everything possible to improve our political relations with Japan.      From this pointof view it was necessary to avoid as far as possibleany action that could be construed as unduly brusque.In this connection the last sentence of recommendation(2) of CP,  106  (34) was submitted to careful examination, viz:&quot;We recommend .......  that the JapaneseGovernment should be informed that ......His Majesty&apos;s Government have thereforecome reluctantly to the conclusion thatno useful purpose will be served bypursuing the discussions further, andthey are therefore obliged to resumeliberty of action.&quot;It was suggested that the Japanese ambassador should be informed with all possible courtesy andwith the accompaniment of every expression of goodwillthat the Government feel it impossible to delay any longer in taking action:    that as the Japanese Governmenthave not found it possible to make any suggestions ^       &apos;they have decided to instruct the Import duties advisory Committee to,proceed with its Report wh4rsfe.on fUdh. ctud cutiptircU filh .ui:tdiute4^^Ly-4iiA^ the ambassador should also be informed that the Governmentwere taking steps to protect our interests by measures   .to restrict Japanese imports in the Colonies.The Cabinet agreed subject to above -(a) To accept   generally the policy setforth in the Report of the CabinetCommittee on Japanese Trade Competition,CP,  106 (34):(b) That the President of the Board of trade should see the Japanese Ambassador again and in the most friendly way make a communication to him on the lines suggested at the Cabinet and summarised above.
