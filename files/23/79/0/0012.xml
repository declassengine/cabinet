Ed 2MTHE NEW MINISTER     1,   The Lord. President of the Council welcomed, to of LABOUR.the Cabinet the new Minister    of Labour.   As thelatter was not a Privy Counsellor he was not, strictlyspeaking, entitled to sit in Cabinet, but in accordancewith the usual practice the Lord President had tie n&apos; the responsibility of inviting his attendance.
pIRMANYPoliticalSituationin.previous reference:gbinet 25(34),Conclusion 1,)2.      The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat,  in consultation with the Officials of the ForeignOffice, he had been trying to form an opinion on therecent events in Germany.      He had come to the conclusionthat there was no evidence of any real plot, still less of an intrigue with a foreign Power.      The situationappeared to be comparable with the Reichstag fireallegations or the alleged leaflets dropped on Berlinwhich no-one had ever seen.      The true deduction appearedto be that the Junkers and the Army had exercised controlover Hitler, who had been manoeuvred into breaking withany element that could be called a &quot;reforming&quot; element.If Hitler had not thrown over R5hm and the others, hewould probably have been overthrown himself.      The newslogan in Germany appeared to be &quot;Hitler can do no harm&quot;.By shooting his adversaries Hitler and his new regimehad avoided any inconvenient enquiry, and according toPress news some legislation was now to be passed to sanction all that had been done.      The precise positionof von Papen in these events was difficult to decide on present information.      The lesson to this countryappeared to be that Germany was getting back to theattitude of before 1914, with Prussian and militaryinfluence at the top,      Hitler nominally in control, andGc-ring acting as liaison officer and engineering the co-operation.      One feature difficult to explain was thatGoebbels had managed to retain his position.      The resultappeared threatening and rather alarming, since, when a nation was in a state of economic difficulty and internal dissension, there was always the risk that itsleaders might seek a way out of their difficulties byan adventure abroad.
In the course of a short discussion the question was asked what country could Germany attack with any prospect of success?      The army, it was suggested, was less likely than the inexperienced rulers of theprevious Nazi regime to take action without calculatin,the consequences.
SEMAN DEBTpOT RATIONS.reviouseferer.ce:foinet 25 (34)inclusion 5).fit.3.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer reported thatthe negotiations with the German representatives on the German Debt had been very difficult.      the negotiators were, however, on the verge of an agreement which would avoid the necessity of establishing a clearing Office of which he was very glad.      He thengave the Cabinet a summary of the principalprovisions of the proposed agreement (Appendix).He hoped that the agreement would be signed thesame morning.      The result was very satisfactory and did great credit to Sir Frederick Leith Ross who hadhandled the German delegation with tact and skill.If the agreement was signed in time he hoped to make an announcement the same afternoon.The Secretary of State for the Colonies saidthat the Chancellor of the Exchequer had consulted him a day or two ago and he fully concurred that theagreement should be accepted though it would leave some difficulties as regards Colonial trade.      Sir frederick leith Ross, however, was going to take up this aspect of the question and talk to the Germans with a viewto avoiding discrimination.In the course of a short discussion general satisfaction was expressed with the Chancellor of theExchequer&apos;s report and his remarks on Sir frederick leith Ross&apos;    part   were warmly welcomed,(Note:    The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs arranged that a communication should be sent to the Dominions beforethe Chancellor of the Exchequer made any announcement.)
4.      The Cabinet had before them a Report by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP.  174 (34))submitted in accordance with the Cabinet conclusion referred to in the margin, together with the Minutesof a meeting held on June 29th, 1934,  on the subjectof the suggested Declaration on the Independence ofBelgium,The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that the Report of the Chiefs ofStaff Committee on the strategical implications ofthe proposed Declaration (which were referred to in thelast paragraph of the Minutes attached to CP,  174 (34))was not yet ready.      In addition, he mentioned thathe had received telegrams which indicated that on,reflection the Belgian Government was less and lessinclined to conclude any non-aggression pact withGermany since the only result might be to weaken the locarno Treaty.In the circumstances he (the Secretary ef State)thought it would be advisable for the Cabinet to postpone their decision on this question for a weekduring which they would be able to study the newmaterial.The Cabinet agreed to postpone a decision until their next regular weekly meeting.

The Lord President of the Council saidthat the two subjects mentioned in the marginwere still before the Ministerial Committee on disarmament and he had no report to make to theCabinet.
6, The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the--President of the Board of Trade (C.P.-167 (34)) tracingthe course of negotiations with Lithuania for a trade agreement.    The main lines of an Agreement had now been provisionally settled, and it was estimated that theeffect, of the undertakings should be an increase overIthe 19 32 trade figures of about  400,000 in UnitedKingdom products into Lithuania.    In addition, increasedtrade might be anticipated from the numerous tariff reductions which had been secured.    The President ofthe Board of Trade accordingly asked his colleagues for authority to conclude a Commercial Agreement withLithuania on the lines indicated in his memorandum and. its Annex, the Agreement to run to the end of 1936,the date already adopted for similar Agreements recently  1negotiated with other countries.The Cabinet approved the proposals of thePresident of the Board of Trade.
l JAPANESEI TRADE COM-I PETITION.I Impos it ionI of Textile(Quotas inI Ceylon.(previous reference:Cabinet 26(34), Con-conclusion 11..7.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum, bythe Secretary of State for the Colonies (CP.-172 (aft))on the subject of Japanese trade competition, oircu-.lating the telegrams which had passed between, theGovernor of Ceylon and himself on the question of theintroduction of the quota legislation.   The Memorandumstated that it was clear that Ministers in Ceylon,even if they were prepared, to introduce it, would not support the necessary legislation, and that there wasno prospect whatever of its acceptance by the state council.    In the circumstances it would, have to becarried, by the exercise of our over-riding powers.As at present advised, the Secretary of State thoughtthat the balance of advantage lay in our proceeding by Order in Council in London, empowering theGovernor to impose the necessary restrictions.The Secretary of State for the Colonies repeatedhis advice that if agreement could not be got with ministers in Ceylon we should, proceed, by Order inCouncil in London.    This course would avoid acrimoniousdebates at all stages of the Bill in Ceylon, since,though a Resolution of objection to the course to beadopted could be moved, there would only be a. singledebate on it,   This plan would enable the Governor toproceed to impose the necessary restrictions.He had discussed the matter with the President ofthe Board of Trade, and he had gathered that the latteragreed that it was impossible to accept the original proposals of the Ceylon Ministers, both for political reasons here and owing to the effect on other Colonies,in some of which the general economic position was worse than in Ceylon, where rubber and. tea were a bright-feature in the situation.   The President of the Boardof Trade, however, he understood, was anxious to make-a further effort to reach a settlement by agreement.
For this the President would be ready to accept a duty of Ifdv, that is to say, the same duty as inSouth Africa, where it worked satisfactorily.   TheMinisters in Ceylon could not be expected to accept this without some quid pro... our.    For these purposesa duty to be imposed in this country on soya beansand an increase from   10% to 20% of the duty in thiscountry on plumbago had been suggested.   The proposedduty on soya beans (which came mainly from Manchukuo)had considerable merits and would help other colonies as well as Ceylon.   Originally they had figured inthe Import Duties Bill.   The manufacturers of cakehad. been satisfied, as to the duty if they could get adraw-back, but at that time the Customs and ExciseDepartment had thought, this impossible.    Mow, however,though difficulties would be encountered, a duty was reported to be possible.   He would therefore like tomake that concession.    The case for raising the dutyon plumbago was not so good.   Manufacturers herepreferred the Madagascar, plumbago, which was of better-quality, but politically the matter was of some importance In Ceylon.    In order to avoid political difficulty and possibly even a boycott of british goods in Ceylon, he agreed with the President of theBoard of Trade that a further attempt should be madeto arrive at an understanding with the Ceylon ministers on the basis of lfd. duty/on soya beans in this country/jas well as the raising of the duty on plumbago from10% to 20g.The suggestion was made that the proposed duty onsoya beans was of more importance to India than toCevlon and that it ought to be kept in reserve as a factor in Indian commercial negotiations.
The President of the Board of Trade doubted ifsoya beans could be made use of in the Indian negotia-tions.   He was apprehensive lest, owing to a boycott,we should lose a very considerable British trade withCeylon, as well as a preference they gave on  lj million of trade with this country.    Soya beans, he admitted,were a troublesome subject, but could now be dealtwith on a simpler basis than formerly.   He had made enquiries as to the effect of the proposed, increasedduty on plumbago and as to why the British Companyconcerned could not work on the basis of a draw-back.He was informed that when the matter had been examinedsome time ago the firm had reported that this wasimpossible.   He had also ascertained that  3,000 ayear would be added to the costs of the Companyconcerned.    It was rather a bad principle to increasethe charges for raw material for a firm engaged inc ompetitive trade.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries saidthat soya beans were also a raw material for the milk industry, and the duty would be imposed at a time when,owing to the drought, prices of the raw material ofthe industry were rising.    Soya beans and. ground nutsseemed to be preferred to other forms of cake.   A risein the price of soya beans might result in a rise inthe prices of other feeding-stuffs.The First Commissioner of Works pointed out,however, that there was a considerable glut in groundnuts, and a rise in the price of soya beans wouldprobably result in consumers turning to ground, nuts .The Lord President of the Council thought that thequestion required looking into Departmentally before a decision was taken.   He compared the position withthe negotiations with the Baltic States, where thedesirability of an agreement had to be determined on a balance of advantage and disadvantage.-10-
^ *J wThe Secretary of State for the Colonies did not object to an inter-Departmental Inquiry, on theunderstanding that the Cabinet would not go back ontheir previous decision authorising him to secure theadoption of a quota system in Ceylon by the use of theGovernor&apos;s powers if this should prove necessary owingto the refusal of the Legislative Council to accept such a system (Cabinet 16 (34), Conclusion 4 (a)).The Lord President agreed that there gas no questionof reopening the previous decision.In reply to the Chancellor of the Exchequer theSecretary of State for the Colonies said that theduty would have to be imposed in the Finance Bill, andif there were any financial legislation before nextyear he hoped It might be possible to make the necessary provision.On the understanding that the previous decision ofthe Cabinet referred, to above (Cabinet 16 (34), Con-elusion 4 (a)) was in no way affected, the cabinet agreed  (a) That, if possible, a further attempt should be made to reach agreement withthe Ceylon Ministers:lb) That an inter-Departmental Committee,composed, of representatives of  The Colonial Office,The Treasury,The India Office,The Board of Trade,The Ministry of Agricultureand Fisheries -should at once examine and. report onthe proposal for a duty in this country on soya beans and for raising the existingduty on plumbago from. 10% to 20%, as apossible basis of agreementwith the Ceylon Ministers,   The inter-Departmental Committee should be asked toreport in time for a decision to be announced when the Colonial Office Voteis discussed, in the T-Touse of Commons,probably on Monday or Tuesday next, July9th or lOth:(c) That the Secretary of State for theColonies should immediately consult
the Governor of Ceylon as to theprospects of.an agreement being reached on the. lines proposed:That if,  on receipt, of the inter-Departmental Committee&apos;s Report and.the reply from the Governor of Ceylon,the Ministers at the head of theDepartments concerned, were in agreement as to the action to be taken, theSecretary of State for the colonies should, report to the Lord Presidentof the Council and. should have authority,with his conctirrence, to act on thedecision and to announce it in Parliament,12-

The Hbssa Secretary reported that he was uncertain as to whetrfcvsx? the proposed meeting ofFascists was to he held at the White City or not.Now he hao. received notice of meetings of Fasciststo he held in Hyde Park and in Trafalgar Square.These might occasion more serious trouble butpossibly it would be easier to deal with them in the open. He did not think he could refuse toallow these meetings.The First Commissioner of Works reported that sir Oswald Moseley had applied for permission tohold a meeting in front of Hampton&quot;Court Palace on land under the jurisdiction of his Department.      Hehad refused permission as it was the policy of theDepartment to refuse sanction to the holding of any political meetings within the precincts or grounds of the Palace.

London credit market as being of no less value than the specialconcessions made by the Netherlands Government, and must for thisreason reserve the right to raise the question in the negotiations.In this connexion, there is a further urgent question affecting thetrade between the two countries. My Government is receiving an increasing volume of complaints that payments due from germany for goods actually delivered have recently not been duly met. Thesecomplaints seem to have arisen more particularly out of the recent-decision to reduce the allocation of foreign exchange to Germanimporters to such amount as is daily received by the Eeichsbank.I trust that the German Government will be able within a few days to remedy this unfortunate situation which must otherwise have serious effects on the trading relations and credit possibilities ofGermany; and my Government suggests that the opportunity of theaforesaid negotiations should be taken to try and clear up the positionas regards these outstanding claims of British exporters.Finally, with reference to the declaration by which our Govern -ments have agreed that commercial relations between the twocountries should be maintained on a non-discriminatory and most friendly basis, I am to say that my Government trusts that theGerman Government will take steps to ensure that the principle ofnon-discrimination shall be applied in all the different fields of its administration.I have, &amp;c.F.
