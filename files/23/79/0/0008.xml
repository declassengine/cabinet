REDUCTION AND 1.   The Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsLIMITATION OFARMAMENTS. reported that the position at Geneva was now quite clear.   The French did not want a Disarmament. Agree-(previous reference: merit.    In no circumstances would they agree to aCabinet 22(34), Con-        Convention which would allow of any re-armament toelusion 1.)Germany,   They crave the following reasons.   First,Clud     they wished to preserve their own existing militarysuperiority   and they preferred, if Germany was tore-arm, that it should be in breach of the Treaty ofVersailles and not as the result of a new Convention,which they did not think Germany would .observe or could be compelled to keep by means of supervision,    Secondly, they were full of the ideaof an Eastern &quot;Locarno&quot;, some details of which were described in the note of a conversation he had. had with Tevfik Rustii Bey, copies of which he had circu-lated to the Cabinet.  .Thirdly, they anticipated a break-up of Hitlerism, which was possibly due to thefact that Paris was full of emigres.    Fourthly, they,. , c curtdxd not think it necessary to pay , to us because they believed that the United Kingdom must, by force of circumstances, come in on the side of France:    in fact the Secretary of State recalled that the first remarkthat M. Barthou had ever made to him was  &quot;Your countryis more afraid of Germany than we are&quot;,   ^o Prance,security meant an alliance to encircle Germany.   Animportant event had occurred on the previous day atGeneva, when M* Barthou. had repudiated the idea of guarantees of execution being of any value at all.A foreign representative at Geneva had remarked thaton the first day M. Barthou had estranged the United.Kingdom:    on the second day, the six Small Powers tand on the third, day. the President of the Conference.-1-
The Lord Privy Seal had sent him a message that dayindicating that the situation was probably beyondmending.   He thought that Mr Henderson would probablyadjourn the Conference.    A cause of satisfaction ina somewhat gloomy situation was that there had been nobreach between the United Kingdom Delegation and thePresident of the Conference:    in fact they had &quot;workedvery closely   and the United Kingdom Delegation hadhelped Mr Henderson to draft- the resolution that hadbeen rejected by M. Barthou on the previous day.   Thatwas important from the point of view of domesticpolitics,   The roan most likely to make trouble wasM. Litvinoff.The Prime Minister paid, a tribute to the work ofthe United. Kingdom Delegation at Geneva.    He felt sure that the Cabinet- would wish to record their satisfaction,but he raised a question as to whether any publicnotification should be made of this, in view of thefact that the French Cabinet had. sent a telegram of support to M, Barthou at Geneva.    On the whole,however, the general view was that in this country itwas known that when the Foreign Secretary spoke he hadthe support of the Cabinet.    Something might be said,however, in Debate in the House of Commons.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs expressed his thanks.After some discussion the Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Ministerial Committee on disarmament- should meet at No. 10,Downing Street,  on Monday, June 11th,at 10.30 a,m,, to consider the situa-tion arising out of the DisarmamentConference.    (See also fo11 ow In g0 one lus ion .)(b) To place on record their recognitionof the conduct of the negotiations at&apos;Geneva by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs and the Lord Privy Seal.
I5S2. In the course of the discussion referred toin the preceding Conclusion the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs said that the question of Defence Require-ments appeared likely to arise in view of the situationover Disarmament.   Moreover, he thought that an early decision ought, to be taken on the request made to himby       Hyraans in London on May 17th, on behalf of theBelgian Government    for some kind of &quot;preventiveguarantee&quot; to Belgium *^be Prime Minister said he had been considering thetime-table on Defence Requirements.   He had come to theconclusj on that if&quot; the Cabinet were to take decisionsbefore the Recess the Report ought to be in the handsof members not. later than Friday, -July 6th.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat as Acting Chairman he had approved the circulationthe same evening of a Draft Report as a basis for dis-  -  jcussion.    Of course it was founded on the ground already covered by the Ministerial Committee, and could not becompleted until the proposals  of the Chancellor of theExchequer had. been discussed.   He thought, however, itwould save time if the Committee could agree on thequestions of principle and policy already discussed atthe Ministerial Committee.The Cabinet took note that a Draft report would be circulated to the ministerial committee on Disarmament the same eveningfor consideration at the Meeting arranged,as recorded, in the preceding Conclusion.
THE TITHE BILL. 3,  The Cabinet had before them the following documents on the subject of the Tithe Bill:-mhe Conclusions of a Meeting ofMinisters (C.P.-150 (34)) held inpursuance of the decision of theCabinet recorded in the marginand circulated by direction ofthe Prime Minister.   At this Meetingit was agreed  (l) That an announcement of theGovernments decision to setup a Royal Commission and notto proceed with the Tithe Billpending the Royal Commission&apos; sReport should be made in theHouse of Lords by the Secretaryof State for War, if possible onThursday, June 7th, and that theterms of this announcement shouldbe settled by Lord Hailsham inconsultation with the Ministerof Agriculture and Fisheries ,(S) That in the circumstances no useful purpose would be served by referring the Tithe Bill toa Select Committee of the Houseof Lords, and that accordinglyLord Hailsham&apos;s announcement should make no reference to thisproposal,(3) That the Minister of -Agricultureand Fisheries should, proceed withthe discussion with the Chancellorof the Exchequer and other ministers concerned of the Terms of reference and the personnel of the RoyalCommission, with a view, ifpossible, to these matters beingready for consideration by theCabinet at their next Meeting onWednesday, June 6th, 1934.(4) That it would be desirable that theannouncement of the Government&apos;decision in the House of Lords on june 7th should,  if -possible,include the notification of theTerms of Reference and personnel of the proposed Royal Commission.A Memorandum by the Minister of Agri-culture and Fisheries  (C.P.-151 (34))circulating for the consideration ofhis colleagues the following Terms ofReference to the proposed Royal Corn-mission on Tithe Rentcharge:-&quot;That a Gonmission should forthwithissue to inquire into and report upon the whole question of TitheRentcharge in England and Yfelesand its incidence, with special reference to stabilised value,statutory remission, powers of recovery and method and. terms ofredemption ***Proposed RoyalCommission &quot;on)     Tithe Rent-charge .(previous reference:Cabinet 22( 34), C on-clusion 1.3.)r-.fi
The Minister suggested that theCommission should consist of five members and that the Chairmanshould, be one who has held orholds high legal office under theCr oipn.Discussion was mainly confined to the draftterms of reference quoted above and the chairmanship of the proposed Royal Commission.It was suggested that owing to the extentto which the subject of tithe was rooted in thelaw, it was eminently desirable that the Chairmanshould be a judge.The Prime Minister and the Lord Chancellorpointed out, however, that in the present stateof business in the Courts every judge availablefor active work, even though he had retired, was required to clear off the long list of waiting cases.The Cabinet agreed -j      (a)    To approve the Conclusions recorded1 in CP.  150 (34) and quoted above.(b) To approve the terms of reference tothe Royal Commission on Tithe RentCharge quoted above subject to -(i)    Further consideration by theMinister of Agriculture andFisheries in consultation withthe Secretary of State for war of the term &quot;powers of recovery&quot;.(ii)    Further examination by the Ministerof Agriculture and Fisheries as towhether the first six lines of theterms of reference were appropriate,(c) That the Chairman of the Royal commission should be a lawyer of distinction andstanding in the profession but not a judgeif this would interfere with the workof the Law Courts.(d) That the Leader of the House of Lords shouldmake an announcement on Thursday, 7th June,in the House of Lords as proposed in cp. 150 (34).
WHALING, 4.    The Cabinet had before them a Joint MemorandumkRegulation of. by the Secretary of State for Scotland, and the MinisterLegislation       of Agriculture and Fisheries (C.P.-149 (34)) on theto RatifyConvention.       subject of legislation to ratify the Convention forthe regulating of Whaling (Cmd.4541, March 31, 1934) .(previous reference:       For the reasons stated in the Memorandum it appearedCabinet 17(34), Con-       essential that this legislation should, be introducedelusion 7.)immediately and an endeavour made to secure its passager, aJ^ijlt-)]^      through Parliament during the present Session -  acourse in which the Secretaries of State for ForeignAffairs, Dominions Affairs and the Colonies, and thePresident of the Board of Trade, concurred.The Minister of Agriculture and fisheries and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsimpressed on the Cabinet the importance of legislatingin this matter.      The Norwegians had been giving effect to the International Convention for some timeand were protesting against our inaction in a matter in which we had taken the initiative.      They mightnot continue to observe the Convention unless weacted.      Their case was unanswerable.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheriesadmitted that the Bill was rather a long one.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs thought it was impossible to make it a short Billmerely ratifying a Convention as it was necessaryto provide penalties.The Cabinet agreed -(a) That the Bill should be submitted to theCommittee of Home Affairs by whom it^ should be carefully considered.(b) That&apos; when approved by the Cabinet, itshould be introduced in the House of Lords,
5.    The Cabinet bad before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Scotland (G.P.-152 (34))outlining a scheme of temporary assistance to the herring Pishing Industry during the summer season from june to September this year, pending the Report -of theSea Pish Commission which is investigating the re-organisation of the industry.    The Memorandum statedthat the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries eoncurrein the scheme provided that English vessels would be eligible for assistance on the same terms as Scottishvessels so far as might be required:    the figures giventhroughout the Memorandum therefore included provisionfor England as well as Scotland.   The actual proposals were as follows:-(l)  For the sole purpose of assisting theboats to fit out, an undertaking to begiven to meet any amount by which theboat&apos;s share f i.e.    about one-third) ofthe net returns falls short of  50 ( 25for motor drifters)  or the actual fittingout expenditure if less.    This undertakingwould, enable the boats, especially inScotland, to meet the minimum charges which are necessary to allow them, to goto sea in reasonably good condition.The liability was unlikely to exceed 25,000 .(2) The provision of loans for the purchaseof 24. nets per boat for 12 for the smallboats) at . 3:10:0 per net.    These loans,which are similar to loans given in 1924and 1929, would help to meet a seriousdeficiency in the supply of nets.   Theamount provided for this purpose was to belimited to  ,50,000.The secretary of State for Scotland explainedthat the scheme would be restricted to about 1,000boats and would only be applicable pending the Reportof the Sea Fish Commission.The President of the Board of Trade considered thesecond, part of the scheme, for the provision of nets,an admirable one.   He pointed out, however, that thefirst part of.the scheme was open to the objection that it somewhat resembled the demand of the tramp shipowners  for a subsidy for a year.    If the CabinetTHE HERRINGFISHINGindustry.Pr opos edTemporaryAssistanceto .(previous reference e:Cabinet 33(24), Con-clusi on 7 ,)
I 0 Iapproved the fishing scheme it would give strong arguments to the tramp ship owners in the finaldiscussions,  and they would claim it as a precedent.Up to this point he had avoided subsidies and had never discussed with the tramp ship owners any formof subsidy except a &quot;fighting&quot; subsidy, which was oneof quite a different order.The President of the Board of Trade&apos;s remarks led the Chancellor of the Exchequer also to hesitate to approve/the first part of the scheme.The whole scheme, including the first part, however,was very strongly supported at the Cabinet, partly owingto the general desire to keep alive this industry, which gave employment to a particularly fine and sturdyelement in the population; and partly because it was hoped that this help might prove the starting-point ofa re-organisation of the industry.    In this latterconnection it was pointed out that at present therewere too many fishing boats and that manv of them were too old.   ^he character of the industry had changed agood deal in recent years, and rationalisation wouldprobably involve cutting down the number of boats .These were matters, however, which were under considera-tlon by the Sea Pish Commission.In connection with the first part of the schemestress was laid on the importance of insisting, without allowing any alternative, that the industry should,itself administer the fund without resort to theGovernment.   The setting up of a Committee for thispurpose, it was pointed out, would be of special importance as a possible starting-point for the rationalisation of the industry.The Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Presidentof the Board of Trade insisted that if, in deference to the views of their colleagues, they were to agree-8-
to the first part o^ the scheme, they must he assured of the united and whole-hearted support of the Cabinetin their negotiations with the tramp ship owners,where they would take the line that the assistance tothe fishing industry,  limited as it was both in amount and in time, was not a precedent applicable tothe tramp shipping industry .^he Cabinet agreed.  (a) To approve the proposals of the Secretaryof State for Scotland, set forth in CP.-153(34) and summarised above:(b) That the first part of the scheme,providing assistance to boats to fitout, must be administered by theIndus try itself, without resort tothe G overnment:(c) That the Cabinet should give their full support to the Chancellor of the Exchequerand. the President o^ the Board of Tradein their negotiations with the tramp shipowners, when they would take the line thatthe assistance to the fishing industry,limited as it was both in amount and intime, was not a precedent applicable tothe tramp shipping industry.

He thought they had taken too rosya view of certain Indian precedents.The Chancellor of the Exchequer also said hewould be glad for a little more time to study theReport.The Cabinet agreed -(a) That members of the Cabinet who wished toraise any point on the Report of the InterDepartmental Committee should communicatein the first instance direct with the .Secretary of State for the Colonies.(b) That the question should be reserved untilthe next weekly meeting of the Cabinet.

Instructions to the British Government Delegatesas to the line they should take on each subject.The Minister of Labour mentioned one smallpoint in which the Foreign Office were concerned,namely, the question of the credentials of theWorkers&apos; Representatives from Italy and Austria.In the past the official Delegates had not voted onthis question though of course they were represented on the Credentials Committee which reported to theConference.      They would not make any departure from their usual attitude without consulting theForeign Office.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs was satisfied with the decision.The Cabinet took note of the Memorandum.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I.,6th June,  1934.
