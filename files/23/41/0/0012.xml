Western Front. 1. THE Director of Military Intelligence described the presentposition with the aid of a map. He stated that on the previous daythere had been no infantry action east of JRheims, but to the west of that town the enemy had offered a very strong resistance to theFrench advance. The French had crossed the Marne in at least three places, which General Macdonogh indicated on the map, andhad secured possession of high ground to the north of the river.On Sunday night the Germans had made a counter-attack, whichhad achieved a temporary success, but the following day the french had recovered all lost ground and had made further progress. Theposition to-day, therefore, was quite satisfactory.As regards the possibility of an enemy attack in another sector of the Western front, General Macdonogh said that if such anattack were projected, there were signs that the enemy wouldprobably select the Kemmel area. Indications pointing to thissupposition were that sixteen heavy batteries had entered that areasince the 1st instant, and that two cavalry divisions had been trans-ferred to Flanders from Alsace-Lorraine.General Macdonogh, proceeding, said that, according to informa-tion received the previous day, General Foch had withdrawn since last month from the immediate fighting area, nineteen French, twoAmerican, and two Italian divisions.The Prime Minister said that he had received a communication from the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, dated 10 p. m,, 22nd July,stating that he had seen General Foch, and that the general situation was regarded as most satisfactory. All reports described the moral of the French troops as excellent, and there were goodgrounds for hoping that the present success might be still furtherexploited.German Divisions 2. The Director of Military Intelligence said that the GermansEmployed. I had now thrown in 3 fresh divisions.    Since the French had started their counter-attack, 24 enemy divisions had been identified as being engaged between Soissons and Chateau-Thierry, making atotal of 57 German divisions between Soissons and east of Rheims.No more divisions from Prince Rupprecht&apos;s army had been identified as coming south. Two divisions from the Crown Prince&apos;s forces hadbeen, transferred from Von PIutier&apos;s army to the Ilnd Army underPrince Rupprecht.&apos;ther Fronts. 3. The Director of Military Intelligence said there was nothing of importance to report in regard to the other theatres of operations.The French had made a small advance in Albania, and it was reported that the Germans intended to transfer all young and fit men from their divisions in the East to the Western front.Bombing Raid atCattaro.- 4. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that four D.H. machines,with one escorting seaplane, had carried out an attack on Cattaro onthe 21st July. One machine failed to return, and it was feared thatit had been shot down. Bombs were dropped in the Aacinity of thesubmarine base at Cattaro, and two were seen to explode among the submarines, and one near the submarine quarters.Bombing Rakls^onBelgian Ports.5. During the day of the 22nd July bombs were dropped onOstend, Bruges, and Zeebrugge. Enemy air activity had been considerable, thirty enemy aircraft being engaged, of which fourwere driven down. During the night of the 2lst-22nd instant twoGothas were brought down by anti-aircraft gunfire. Two of our machines were missing.
3IWG 266. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that a German submarine had attacked a tug and barges 3 miles off the Massachusetts coast.The tug had not been sunk, but the barges, with women andchildren on board, had been set afire by shells.7. The Prime Minister explained to the Indian representatives that, owing to an oversight, they had not been asked with theDominion Prime Ministers to attend the previous day&apos;s War Cabinet(War Cabinet 450, Minute 8), at which the answer to PresidentWilson&apos;s aide-memoire had been sanctioned. He apologised tothem for this, and trusted that they were in agreement with the message that had been sent.The Indian representatives expressed their entire concurrencewith the action that had been taken.8. The Imperial War Cabinet discussed the following resolu-tions which had been passed by the Imperial War Conference : (1.) That this Conference is of the opinion that the development which has taken place in the relations between theUnited Kingdom and the Dominions necessitates such achange  in administrative  arrangements  and  in  the channels of communication between their governments as will bring them more directly in touch with each other.(2.) That  the  Imperial War  Cabinet  be  invited  to  giveimmediate consideration to  the creation  of  suitablemachinery for this purpose.Mr. Hughes said it was generally agreed that the time had come when the self-governing Dominions should be in direct touchwith the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.   The presentsystem of communication, however suitable to what might be called the Colonial days, was not suited to the present circumstances.The matter was one which had been urged before at imperial conferences, but the British Government had taken the view thatit would not do to overburden the Prime Minister of the UnitedKingdom.   Since then, however, the creation of the Imperial WarCabinet had furnished a machinery which seemed suitable for thepurpose.    While the Imperial War Cabinet was in session theDominion Governments in  fact  discussed matters directly in aCabinet of Governments : Prime Ministers of the Dominions werein direct touch with the Prime Minister of Great Britain.   Whenthey separated they would&apos;no longer be in direct touch, but have tomeander again through the indirect channels of the Colonial Office.He wanted to exchange this for direct touch with the British PrimeMinister as Chairman of the Imperial WarfCabinet.   He consideredthat in future the Colonial Office should no longer exercise any powers of administration as regards the Dominions, and that, inter alia, the appointment of Governors-General should be a matter forthe Prime Minister.    He did not wish  to  create a sribsidiaryDepartment in which this matter was entirely handed over bythe Prime Ministers to another Minister.   What was wanted was something more than a mere change from one Department toanother.   He wanted a formal but real recognition of the fact thatthe Dominions were participants in the councils of the Empire on a footing of equality.    They were Governments, each sovereign orquasi-sovereign in its own sphere, consulting with each other about their common affairs.Sir Robert Borden in supporting Mr. Hughes said that he had had experience as Prime Minister of three different Secretaries ofState for. the Colonies, and readily paid his tribute to the ability,devotion, and consideration with which they had conducted their task, and to the broad-minded attitude they had shown in the
despatch of their duties. - From first to last he had noli a word of criticism against the attitude of the Colonial Office. But the changeSuggested was an inevitable consequence of the step taken by thePrime Minister in December 1916 in summoning the Imperial WarCabinet. He regarded that as a wise step, justified even if it lastedonly for the duration of the war, though he understood that it wasto form the basis of a system for giving the Dominions an adequatevoice in Imperial affairs in the future. He pointed out that theDominions had come into the war voluntarily, as free nations ofthe Empire, because they believed it to be their duty. But theBritish Government could not call upon Canada to come into anotherwar with regard to the causes of which she had had no voice.Canada was a nation of 8,000,000 people, twice as large as theUnited States when they became independent, and they must havea voice in foreign affairs. Unless she could have that voice in the foreign relations of the Empire as a whole, she would before long have an independent voice in her ownforeign affairs outside the Enquire. At present the Imperial WarCabinet met for only two months in -the year. It was essentialthat there should be means of constant consultation, andthat the relationship between the Dominions and the UnitedKingdom which existed during the Session of the Imperial WarCabinet should continue for the whole twelve months. It was withthis object in view that direct communication between the DominionGovernments and the Imperial War Cabinet as a body regarded asin constant session was advocated by them. How this should be worked out was in part an Imperial concern, in part a matter of domestic concern to the British Government. There was no desire,on the one hand, to impose too formidable a burden upon the british prime Minister or, on the other hand, to create a condition of things inwhich his direct connection with Dominion affairs should be nominalrather than real. He ventured to throw out suggestions as to three possible ways in which a solution might be found. In the firstplace, the matter might be left entirely with the Prime Minister.Or secondly, the Prime Minister might be ex officio Secretary ofState for Imperial affairs, but have an Assistant Secretary or under-study to conduct the correspondence with the Dominions on routinematters. Or thirdly, it might be possible to have an ImperialSecretary of State separate from the Prime Minister and responsiblefor keeping the different Members of the Imperial War Cabinet inclose and constant touch with one another.In answer to a question whether his resolution included thepermanent maintenance of a Dominion Minister in the UnitedKingdom, Sir Robert Borden said that he had not thought out that particular point, though as a matter of fact Canada throughout thewar had had a member of its Government resident in London.Mr. Massey associated himself with what Sir Robert Borden had said about the last three Secretaries of State for the Colonies and ofthe Colonial Office. No set of men could have been more coxirteous,painstaking, and more successful in dealing with the problems whichthey had taken, in hand. With regard to the actual resolution, withwhich he agreed, he considered everything depended, on the futureof the Imperial War Cabinet, which he understood was to continue as a permanent institution. The essential thing from his point ofview was that each oversea Dominion should maintain a resident minister in this country, so as to enable the Imperial Cabinetto meet at regular intervals. The Dominion Governments could then communicate with the British Government through theirown Ministers. For this purpose it was essential to have Ministers,not High Commissioners, and these Ministers would have to keepin touch with their own Dominions by at least yearly visits home.As far as New Zealand was concerned, improvements in the meansof communication had been brought about by the Panama Canal,which would render that feasible.   He doubted whether it was
possible for the whole responsibility for inter-Imperial communica-tions to be placed upon the Prime Minister.General Smuts said that if he had been present at the ImperialConference, he would have dissented from the second part of theresolution, which asked the Imperial War Cabinet to giveimmediate consideration to the creation of suitable machinery forthe purpose of more direct communication. There was generalagreement as to fundamentals. The Colonial Office embodied therjractical wisdom of the British people, and its conduct of affairs inthe past had been one of the marvels of British policy. Neverthe-less, there was general agreement that the position had changed, andthat the old machinery would no longer suit the case. The change was two-fold. In the first place, the young nations of the Empirehad risen to nationhood, more particularly since the war, in a way that had never been contemplated before. If the Empire was toendure, it must endure on a basis of equality, and that implied thecreation of some machinery of equality. In the second place, theGovernment of the United Kingdom had completely changed from what it had been even 10 years ago. The War Cabinet system was an entirely new instrument of Government. What was required was to devise a constitution for the Empire which should takecognisance of these two facts. The problem, in his opinion, Avassoluble, but at this moment in the midst of the war, and with theBritish Government overwhelmed with enormous and urgentproblems, he could not conceive a more difficult task than that of devising a new organisation. The Prime Minister was, more particu-larly at the present moment, so overwhelmed with work that the meremention of any additional burden showed the impossibility of sucha thing. The whole question bristled with difficulties. It involved achange in the position of the Governors-General, as well as a corre-sponding change in the representation of the Dominions in London.There was also the question of the status of the Crown Colonies and protectorates in this connection. He did not regard the question as aside issue. Whatever the war might mean, it meant a new era anda new organisation in the history of the British Empire. But thiswas a matter wdiich would require the most ample consideration.He himself would therefore urge that the Imperial War cabinet should not go beyond affirming the general expression of opinioncontained in Part 1 of the resolution, and would leave the detailed consideration of the question for afterwards. To do anything elsewould only mean some unsuitable compromise. He did not want to&apos;make two bites at the cherry, and would therefore prefer to see thequestion shelved for the present./ Mr. Lloyd said that, while in general agreement with theresolution, he was very sceptical as to the possibility of the PrimeMinister being able to give due attention to the work involved indealing with the Dominions. He considered that there should be permanent Ministerial representation of the Dominions in London asfar as possible and a special Secretary of State to represent theDominions, except when the Prime Ministers or other Ministers ofthe Dominions were actually present. He was not in sympathy withthe idea that the question should be wholly shelved. He consideredthat some step might be taken in cutting out the circumvolution tothe present system of communication, even if it were only to cut outthe communication through the Governor or Governor-General.Mr. Balfour pointed out that the real crux of the problem layin how to secure unity of control to equal States over a singleforeign policy. There was obviously no need for unity of control orrepresentation on some common body as regards local affairs. Evenas regards the army and navy, it was possible to have a separateWar Office and Admiralty for each Dominion, though there would,of course, have to be arrangements to secure a common policy for common action in time of war. But it was not possible to have more than one Foreign Office or one foreign policy at a time.   That,[530-12] &quot; C
was the problem the solution of which was most difficult to find. a mere allocation of certain positions in the Foreign Office to theDominions as a matter of right, would not go to the root of thematter. . As long as foreign policy remained the most importantImperial interest, as it seemed likely to do, that problem had to be faced. Jf the united strength of the Empire was to be put forward for any external purpose, the Dominions would have to exercise ashare in the control of a single Foreign Office.Sir Robert Borden remarked that unless the Dominions sharedin the direction of foreign policy they could not share in theresponsibility which it entailed.Mr.. Hughes pointed out that this resolution was severely limitedto the immediate question of communication. The wider questionof a permanent share in the control of the Imperial policy afterthe war would have to be decided at a later stage.Mr. Montagu said that, from the point of view of India, he was inclined to share General Smuts&apos; attitude. If the Dominions wereto be put into direct communication with the Prime Minister, he did not see how the same could be done with regard to India. ThePrime Minister could not certainly be Secretary of State for india as well as for the Dominions. He thought that if the Dominionsgained something in this way w-hich was not granted to India, itmight have an unfavourable effect there. Pie referred to the factthat the question of Imperial organisation was also being discussed by one of the Committees of the Ministry of Reconstruction, whichwas dealing with Departmental Affairs. Among the suggestionsthrown out had been one that the Prime Minister should beSecretary of State for all Imperial affairs, having under him three separate Ministers for the Dominions, India,, and the crown colonies.Mr. Chamberlain suggested that as regards the narrowerquestion of communication, that was a matter of detail which couldbe worked out without great difficulty. As regards the largerquestion of the share of the Dominions in the decision of commonImperial policy, he asked whether it was not possible for Sir robert borden and those who shared his views to furnish some indication of the methods which might be suitable for bringing about theresult they aimed at.Sir Robert Borden said that while he considered that thelarger question w^ould have to be solved if the Empire was tokeep together, he agreed that it was a matter which must betaken up at a special Conference after the war. Meanwhile the war was going on. The terms of peace w-ere, in fact, being made everyday. All that he asked at present was that there should be a directmethod of Communication. This did not forestall the wider question in any way, or, as far as he could see, involve any danger. He saw no reason why that question should be shelved.The Prime Minister said it was important to find out exactly what was being discussed, and what were the practical methods ofcarrying out their wishes. Was all that they contemplated thatthere should be the same communication between the different PrimeMinisters of the Empire as there was between himself and M. Clemen-Clemenceau and M. Orlando, on the question of peace or war?Mr. Hughes thought that that was essential at any rate for thewar. There was always the danger of peace coming suddenly, and long before Mr. Massey or himself could arrive in this country thepourparlers might have committed the Empire irrevocably. Theymight arrive, in fact, to find the principles of the League of Nations,or the Freedom of the Seas, accepted, and the Empire no longer, asa reality, in existence.The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested that the general idea of transferring the work of the Colonial Office to the PrimeMinister at this juncture would be a fatal mistake. He thought thatthe routine work was very much better done by a Minister who had
specially devoted himself to the task. On the other hand, it seemedto him absurd that the Prime Ministers of the Dominions should be hampered in dealing with the Prime Minister of the United kingdom by rules as regards communicating either through the Governors-General or through the Colonial Office. He thought they would beprepared to admit that when a Prime Minister wished to communi-cate with the Prime Minister of this country, he might do so directly,and suggested that a small Committee might be appointed toconsider the question of the best method of doing.this.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that he had himselfmade proposals on the subject which he would submit to theCabinet. No one challenged the general decision that altered circum-stances demanded altered arrangements. The real difficulty lay inthe actual machinery. The position of the Governors-General forinstance, would be very seriously affected, and he did not think thatthe matter could be dealt with without much fuller consideration.He deferred the remainder of his statement until the resumeddiscussion.The discussion was then adjourned.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.23rd July, 1918.
