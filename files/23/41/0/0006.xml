The Western Front. I. THE Director of Military Intelligence reported ,that, exceptfor the repulse of an enemy attack by the Italians near iRheims,there had been no military events of importance on the western front. Prince Rupprecht now had 28 fresh divisions in reserve, and32 available for roulement.The Italian Front.2. The Director of: Military Intelligence reported that, exceptfor a little ground which the Austrians still retained on the Brentasector, they had everywhere retired to their former positions, andwere apparently also withdrawing, on the extreme left of their line,in the area between the old and the new Piave. In the Brentasector the Italians had made an effort to recapture Mont Asolone, andhad temporarily occupied the summit, but had been pushed back.The Italian cavalry and infantry patrols which had crossed the. Piavehad met with heavy fire, and had not returned. Lord Cavan had reported that the total British casualties in the recent fighting hadbeen 117 officers and 1,600 other ranks. The enemy&apos;s casualties had been very high, including about 1,000 prisoners. Altogether theAllies had taken something like 16,000 Austrian prisoners.Air Attacks onCattaro andZeebrugge.3.The First Sea Lord reported that the Air Forces attachedto the Navy had made ah attack on Cattaro, and had been carryingout the usual attacks on Zeebrugge.The Air Situation.4. The Chief of the Royal Air Staff reported that there hadbeen a great deal of reconnaissance work clone between the 20thand 23rd June in France The indications as to the enemy&apos;intentions, as far as they went, pointed to special activity in thearea Foret de Nieppe-Ypres. The weather had been unfavourablefor night observation There had not been much air fighting, asthe enemy had not been pushing his machines much over our line,possibly owing to the weather, but there had been a good deal ofshooting at ground targets.In Italy, during the same period, four enemy machines hadbeen brought down, without any loss on our side, and there hadbeen a great deal of shooting at ground targets.The-Strategic Striking Force at Ouchy, which had been unableto conduct operations between the 13th and the 22nd owing to the weather, had launched a series of four attacks on Metz-Sablonsstation on the evening of the 23rd, dropping six tons of bombs,and had effectively bombed saarbrucken, Dillingen, and Metz-Sablons on the 24th. Enemy machines had gone up to attack them,and two of these had been brought down, without casualties to ourselves. /Sir William Weir drew attention to the increasing importanceof photographic observation as compared with personal observation.The Middle East:Review by lord curzon.5. Lord Curzon, as Chairman of the Eastern Committee,reviewed the whole situation in the Middle East. He indicated that German ambitions, which had received an immense impetus sincethe collapse of Russia and the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, lay alongtwo main lines of advance : a northern line through the Black Sea,the Caucasus, the Caspian and Turkestan, to the borders of ChineseTurkestan; and the southern through Palestine, Mesopotamia, and through Persia and Afghanistan against India. The whole of thearea between these lines was a theatre of actual or piobable warfare.Germany&apos;s intentions as regards the southern line had beenmaturing for some twenJ/uve years, and had specially centredround the construction of the Baghdad Railway.   Her hand with
31WG 20regard to Persia and Afghanistan had first been shown in thearmistice preceding the Brest-Litovsk Treaty, and in the treatyitself, both of which contained clauses directly challenging theBritish position in the East and holding out a feeler for Persian andAfghan co-operation. Since then, the successive stages of theGerman advance had been the peace with Roumania, the occupationof the Ukraine, the occupation of Odessa and the Crimea, togetherwith the seizure of the Russian Black Sea fleet, and now the invasion of the Caucasus. With regard to this invasion, lord curzon drew special attention both to the enormous economicpotentialities of the Caucasus and to the political rivalry in this region between Germans and Turks, both of whom were at this moment engaged in a race for Baku. The capture of Baku wouldgive the Germans access, if they could secure the Caspian fleet, tothe Volga, to Turkestan, and to Northern Persia.British action had in the past been mainly confined to meetingthe enemy&apos;s advance on the southern line. After beating off two attacks on Egypt, we had advanced into Palestine, where we howenjoyed the active co-operation of the Arab movement, a matter ofthe first importance not only from its immediate military aspect,but also with a view to the ultimate settlement of Mesopotamia andof all the area occupied by the Arab race, where the Turks had hitherto maintained an alien domination, to which he trusted noterritory, once liberated, would be restored. In Mesopotamia, as inPalestine, our advance had not been a mere roving adventure, but hadbeen dictated by imperative strategic considerations. We were nowcompelled to extend our sphere of operations to Persia, where theobject of our various measures was to keep Persia out of the warand to maintain a friendly Government.After touching on the situation in Afghanistan, and layingstress upon the position of India both as the core and centre ofBritish power in the East and as the objective of Germany&apos;s advance,Lord Curzon laid before the Imperial War Cabinet the following conclusions from his survey :-(a.) The  necessity  of  rebuilding a Russia  from whateverelements were available.(6.) The impossibility, from the strategic point of view, of allowing the enemy to recover Palestine and Mesopotamia the two channels by which he could press forward to egypt and the Persian Gulf,(c.) The  necessity  of  securing  a friendly   Persia,   a loyal.  Afghanistan, and, above  all, a powerful, loyal,  andcontented India.(cLVThe immediate urgency of Japanese intervention in theFar East, along a new northern line of advance, bywhich the Germans could be forestalled and our own efforts further south materially assisted.A short discussion followed on the subject of japanese intervention, with regard to which there was general agreementwith the conclusions laid down by Lord Curzon. In view, however,of the fact that several important telegrams and reports of interviewshad not yet been circulated to members of the Imperial War Cabinet,it was decided To postpone the discussion to the next meeting of the imperial war Cabinet on Thursday next, the 27th June, at whichdefinite instructions could be given to the delegates whowill take p&apos;art at the forthcoming meeting of the supreme war Council at Versailles. In the meantime it was arranged that the Committee of Prime Ministers should further investigate the question on the following day.
The Imperial War Cabinet further decided that The Air statement, and, if possible, the Admiralty statement,should be made at 3.15 p.m. on Friday next, the 28th June.In view, however, oi the possibility of further developments,with regard to intervention in Russia, it might be foundmore advantageous to have the statement on Thursday, the27th June, and postpone the discussion on intervention toFriday, the 28th June.The text of Lord Curzon&apos;s statement will be circulated in aseparate document.&apos;   2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,June 25, 1918.o
