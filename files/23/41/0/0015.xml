1. THE Prime Minister informed the Imperial War Cabinetthat he was communicating with M. Clemenceau to make it clearthat we were unable to find more cargo-boats than we had already-done for the American forces.l\he Western Front. 2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that therewas no material change in the situation. The Germans had bombedvery heavily behind our lines two nights previously, droppingbombs on twenty towns, and more particularly on Dieppe. Beyondone or two bridges broken, not much damage had been done. Wehad retaliated the previous night with a raid carried out byforty-two machines, and we claimed to have destroyed seven Germanhangars and sixteen machines.Transport of american Troops.Other Theatres.3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff mentioned that theretreat of the Italians in Albania, under the Austrian counter-attack,had uncovered the French flank and considerably annoyed theFrench. There were signs of the Czecho-Slovaks in Siberiaextending their influence southwards towards Turkestan. In thePersian-Caspian region General Wilson reported that half a battalion of North Staffordshires were due at Enzeli, and should reach Bakuon the 3rd or 4th, if shipping was ready for them.In East Africa it looked as if Von Lettow, who was busyreplenishing his troops from the Portuguese posts within his reach,was trying to break back northwards. It would be very inconvenientif he succeeded in his intention.Mr. Long asked if the Chief of the Imperial General staff was thoroughly satisfied in the conduct and progress of the campaign in German East Africa.In this connection, General Smuts pointed out that one of thechief difficulties was the assistance afforded by the natives tothe Germans, owing to their hatred of the Portuguese.Loss of an Airship.Bombing of Bruges.4. The First Sea Lord reported that the airship C 25, which hadbeen sent out after a submarine, had not returned, and was probablylost. - &quot;5. The First Sea Lord reported that there had been considerablebombing activity against Bruges Dock and Zeebrugge. We claimed to have hit a submarine lying off Zeebrugge mole.Air Activity.6. The Chief of the Royal Air Staff stated that there had beenvery heavy fighting in the air on the Western front, exclusive ofFifth Group and the Independent Force, during the last few days,resulting in our bringing down or destroying 71 German machinesto a loss of 12 on our side. The bombing on both sides, to whichthe Chief of the Imperial General Staff had already referred, hadbeen heavy. On an average we dropped, at a moderate&apos; estimate,about three tons of bombs to their one. Considering the bad weather, the operations of the Independent Force against Saar-brucken, Stuttgart, and Mannheim had been very successful. Onthe 31st July the station and factories at saarbrucken were subjected to two attacks. The first formation was heavily attacked by a largenumber of scouts, and in the bitter fighting which ensued lost fourmachines. The remainder of the formation proceeded to Saar-briicken and carried out its work. On the way back it was againvery heavily attacked, and lost three machines. One hostilemachine was driven down. The total number of scouts encounteredis estimated at 40, which represents a serious withdrawal of force
The PetroleumSituation.. 7. The Secretary mentioned that the Secretary of State for theColonies had suggested that Admiral Slade&apos;s Paper on the PetroleumSituation (Paper G.T.-S3&amp;F) should be referred to the PetroleumCommittee. CfSiift ,The Prime Minister stated that this paper bore very vitally onthe discussions of the Committee of Prime Ministers.Mr. Long&apos;s suggestion was agreed to.The Dominions andForeign Policy:Arbitration treaty with Brazil.8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs asked for theauthorisation of the Imperial War Cabinet to his proceeding with an arbitration Treaty with Brazil, which was under discussion. Itwas a type of treaty which the British Government were alwaysready to make with any country, and in the ordinary course hewould have dealt with it as a matter of Foreign Office routine andnot referred it to the War Cabinet. In view, however, of the definite recognition of the right of the Dominions to have a voice inthe settlement of such questions, he thought it better to clear hisconscience by bringing the matter before the Imperial War Cabinet&quot;for authorisation.The Imperial War Cabinet authorised The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to proceed with thenegotiations for the Arbitration Treaty with Brazil.Recruitment in abyssinia.9. The Imperial War Cabinet took note of the conclusionsembodied in Joint Note No. 34 of the Military- Representatives tothe Supreme War Council adverse to the recruitment of troops in abyssinia, and agreed with them.Exchange ofPrisoners of War.[530-15]10. With reference to Imperial War Cabinet 28, Minute 5, theImperial War Cabinet had before them the Hague Agreement(Paper G.-291) and a Memorandum by the Admiralty regarding theexchange of submarine prisoners (Paper G.T.-5272), together writh aMemorandum by Lord Newton on the same subject (Paper G.T.-5284).The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the Admiralty viewedwith the greatest apprehension the ratification of an agreement which included an exchange of submarine prisoners. The WarCabinet had approved the policy that submarine prisoners shouldnot be included (War Cabinet 419, Minute 10 (a) ), and at a later date this decision was altered, to the effect that no negotiations wereto take place with regard to submarine prisoners without specific reference to the War Cabinet (War Cabinet 427, Minute 5). these were the instructions to the British delegates. With regard to thereturn of Captain Kitson with Sir George Cave to this country, sir eric Geddes said that the Admiralty were never consulted with a %from, the enemy&apos;s front line. In view of the odds against them he considered that the fact that our machines actually executed their task against Saarbrucken was most creditable.The second attack on Saarbrucken delivered the same day was completely successful. Bursts were observed among the factories.Our machines were again heavily attacked by hostile scouts, but allreturned safely.A raid against Treves on the 1st August had also brought outthe fact that a large hostile air formation had been concentratedfor the defence of that city. A raid against Cologne on the same day had been prevented by thick clouds, and our machines had dropped their bombs on Duren instead. In Italy we had, betweenthe 28th July and the 1st Aiigust, brought down 14 enemy machineswithout any loss to ourselves.
regard to the appointment of the Naval Attache at the Hague to takeCaptain KitsoAs place, and he resented the statement in LordNewtoAs Memorandum that Captain Kitson and the Naval Attacheacted as assistant delegates. The War Cabinet decided that theAdmiralty should not send a delegate to the Hague, but only a repre-sentative (War Cabinet 425, Minute 18). Apart from the risk thatthe German Admiralty would ignore the treaty and employ thispersonnel under assumed names or otherwise for combatantsubmarine duties, the First Lord said that if these twenty-fourGerman submarine officers and forty-six petty officers were returned, it would give Germany the means of training sub-marine crews, which would undoubtedly result in a serious increasein our sinkings, and would wipe out the success of many months of anti-submarine warfare. Finally, he pointed out that if we gaveway on the present occasion it would make it more difficult in any future negotiations of-the same kind to resist German pressure.Mr. Long asked if any copy of the original draft was in exist-ence ; if so, it should be produced in order to confirm our contention.Sir George Cave said that the British delegates had refused todiscuss the repatriation of submarine crews, and they were not pressed to do so by the Germans. In the draft agreement sir george Cave had himself put in the paragraph relating to theexception of submarine crews. The draft was then considered bythe Conference clause by clause, and the exception was not thenobjected to by the Germans. It was his impression that after he left The Hague the British draft was put on one side and theConference worked on the German draft.It was pointed out that when the omission had been noted theDutch neutral chairman had been seized with the validity of ourclaim, and when visiting Berlin immediately after the conference had made representations on the matter. The draft did exist andcordd be produced.Lord Robert Cecil said that the Committee appointed by theImperial War Cabinet to investigate the subject of retaliation(Imperial War Cabinet 28, Minute 7) had already met. during their deliberations they had discovered that, in Section 3 ofAnDex A to the final protocol of the Agreement, it was stated thatthe British delegates bad taken exception to children under the ageof 15, born in the British Empire of German parents, being returnedto Germany. The Germans had wished that children under theage of 15 should be repatriated with their parents, and, if over15 years of age, the children themselves should decide whetherthey wished to be repatriated or not. This seemed to Lord robert cecil a most reasonable request, and he thought that, if we could give way to the Germans on this point, they might agree to thereinsertion of the clause in the agreement relating to submarineofficers.Sir George Cave said that he did not know what numbers this concession would involve, and in any case the children were legallyBritish subjects, and had received a British&apos; education ; if boys of16 and 17 were sent to Germany they might be of use to germany in the war. It was generally agreed by the Imperial War Cabinetthat children under the age of 15 ought to be allowed to returnto Germany with their parents, and also all girls over the ageof 15. The release of boys over 15 years of age was, however,a different matter.Lord Curzon pointed out that by making this concession wewere paying the Germans a price for keeping to their agreement.It had been an accident that the signatures of the delegates wereaffixed to the wrong draft.Sir Robert Borden was of opinion that the British delegates should not have refused to permit children below the age of 15 togo with their parents. IModification of the,Agreement in that respect could hardly be regarded as a concession.
Sir George Cave said that the Germans were asking for anotherconcession with regard to their countrymen in China.Mr. Balfour protested strongly against any idea of making any concession on the question of the Germans in China in order to induce the Germans to agree to the reinsertion of the clause relatingto submarine prisoners.Some discussion followed as to who was present when theAgreement in its final form had been gone through with theGermans clause by clause. Lord Newton.said this had been doneby a Sub-Committee at which he was not present.Sir Robert Borden said that there had been no clear statementof the circumstances which had led up to the unfortunate mistake.If we were to urge amendment on the German Government theremust be a plain and logical statement of the facts, and it ought tobe submitted to the Imperial War Cabinet. He asked Sir eric geddes whether the limiting factor of German submarine activity was men or construction, and he was told that beyond question itwas men.Lord Robert Cecil said that the recent reply of the GermanGovernment, that they could only sign the Agreement as it stood atpresent, was only their reply to a memorandum of the delegates&apos; .pointing out the omission of the submarine clause.   As yet no reply had been received to the representations made by the BritishGovernment on the subject.The Prime Minister said that the omission of this clause showedan extraordinary piece of carelessness, which had resulted in placing the Government in a position of great difficulty.Mr. Hughes stated that, with regard to Lord Robert CeciPsproposal relating to the return of German children under the age of15, he thought that. this was the rational and proper thing to do,and as the champions of right we should not emphasize too much the fact that this was a concession on our part. We should neverconvince the man in the street that to separate a child from itsparents, whether legal or not, was the humane thing to do. He was,however, against returning to Germany boys over 15 years of ago.The Imperial Cabinet decided (a.) To ratify the text of The Hague Agreement, provided thatit was corrected by the reinsertion of the clause providingfor the exemption of German submarine prisoners.(b.) That we should state our willingness to reconsider thequestion of releasing a number of children born in theBritish Empire of German parents.(c.) That the representatives of the British Government carryingout negotiations on this point should be instructed thatwe would return to Germany all girls and boys born inthe British Empire of German parents up to the age of15, and if neither parent objected would return all girls$ over that age who were willing to go, but that we should refuse to repatriate boys over .15 years of age.(cl.) That Sir George Cave should prepare a statement detailingall proofs, enduces, and arguments which could beadduced to prove that the exemption of submarineprisoners was agreed, and that the omission was merelya drafting or printer&apos;s error.11. The First Lord of the Admiralty informed the imperial war Cabinet that our submarine patrols had secured definite ocularevidence, of the fact that German submarines had made use of norwegian territorial waters in order to get round our minefields.When those minefields were first laid there was some discussion asto whether Norway should be asked to join in in laying the minefieldin her territorial waters, or whether we should lay it right up to the shore, without regard for Norwegian neutrality.   In the end it hadNorwegianTerritorial Waters.
been; decided that we should start the minefield at the edge of norwegian territorial waters, and rely on Norway, insistingeffectively on her neutrality being respected. In view of the evidence which we had now secured, he thought Norway should be definitelyasked whether she would immediately put a stop to the passage of submarines through her waters or leave us to do it. If she was willing to take the former course, we could supply her with thenecessary mines, lie reminded the Imperial War Cabinet that bothSweden and -Norway had laid minefields in their territorial watersat the instance of Germany, in order to prevent our submarinesgetting into the Baltic through the Kogrund Channel. He con-sidered a week sufficient time to give Norway to come to a decision in the matter.   We could lay the mines ourselves in 48 hours.The First Sea Lord reminded the. Imperial War Cabinet that norway had already issued a decree against the use of her territorial waters by submarines. He was inclined to think the Norwegianswould prefer us to carry out the work of completing the minefield.The Imperial War Cabinet decided that (a.) It was essential that the passage of submarines in terri-torial waters be stopped, and approved steps beingtaken to effect this. *(b.) The First Lord of the Admiralty and the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs should consult as to the best way ofdealing with the Norwegian Government in the matter.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,&quot;    August 2,1918.o
