The Western Front. 1. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that there&apos;had been very little actual change on the French front, apart froman unsuccessful attack by three divisions on Rheims, the object ofwhich he had not been able to understand. As regards the im-pending big attack, Prince Rupprecht now had 49 fresh divisions, of\ &apos; . which 26 were in line.   The big machine-gun school at Tongres,near Liege, had just been emptied, and precedents would suggestthat this implied that the attack might begin in a week&apos;s time. The&apos; air report of the 1.8th June showed a great deal of train movementround Cambrai, but otherwise he gathered that the air reports didnot consider that there would be an attack on the Arras-Amiensfront. AThe Italian Front.2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that 34 out of58 Austrian infantry divisions, and 4 out of 6 cavalry divisions, hadalready been identified in the fighting in Italy. Many of the bridgesover the Piave had been broken by floods, and the situation was, onthe whole, very satisfactory. The Italians had plenty of troops, and ought to be able to throw the Austrians back into the river, if theyproperly co-ordinated their effort.The Imperial War Cabinet atithorised  The Prime Minister to send, on its behalf, a message of con-congratulations to the Italian Government on the successfulresistance of the Italian army.Submarines. ^ne First Sea Lord reported that one of our aeroplanes had dropped bombs on a submarine, causing oil and wreckage to cometo the surface. Whether the submarine was actually destroyed was uncertain. Admiral Wemyss added that the figures of shipping losses had been good during the last few days, and that the month,as a whole, had been a good one.The Prime Minister pointed out that this was a pleasing con-tfast to the state of affairs which used to be reported to the imperial war Cabinet at its meetings the year before.The Air Situation 4. The Chief of the Royal Air Staff reported that, on the Frenchfront, during the 18th and 19th June, we had destroyed 25 enemy machines, and driven another 9 down out of control. We, on our side, had 9 missing. In Italy we had brought down 18 machines onthe 18th, at the cost of 1 missing. There had also been a good dealof shooting at ground targets, and of day bombing. Night bombinghad been made difficult in France by bad weather. As to enemymovements, the air reports, as far as the weather enabled conclusions to be drawn, showed a great deal of rail movement on the fronts ofthe 1st and Illrd British Armies, and a decrease on the French front.The indications, so far as they went, pointed towards a movementagainst the British front, more particularly that of the IILrd Army.Bombing of Belgian 5. Lord Curzon drew the attention of the Imperial War CabinetTowns- to a letter which he had received from the Queen of the Belgians onbehalf of herself and King Albert, dealing with the injuries inflicted on the unhappy Belgian population by our air attacks on the enemy.In one case 125 Belgians were reported to have been killed in a factory at Liege. The spirit of the people, already badly shaken,was being shattered by our attacks.The Pi -ime Minister cjuoted a similar letter from the King ofthe Belgians to His Majesty the King, laying stress on the suffering
3iVvC 19caused, and on the deep and legitimate emotion which the knowledgeof these things created in the Belgian army. He had himselffrequently protested, and placed the matter with confidence in HisMajesty&apos;s hands.In the discussion which followed, it was suggested that the bombing of German towns and factories produced a much greatermoral effect upon Germany than similar action in Belgium. against this, however, it was urged that the Belgian factories utilised, by theGermans for military purposes were much nearer, and also that belgium was swarming with German troops, whose moral was undoubtedly, judging by our own experience, affected by continuousbombing.The Chief of the Royal Air Staff undertook to look into thewhole question, with a view to the possibility of issuinginstructions to our airmen, which, without conveying any suggestion of criticism of their efforts, should lay stress onthe desirability of sparing the Belgian civil population asmuch as possible.Survey of theForeign Situation.6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs surveyed theforeign situation generally, taking in review, first of all, the con-ditions in the various Allied countries; then, in certain neutral countries ; and, lastly, in Russia. He dwelt upon the completeanarchy into which Russia had fallen, and the incompetence and almost complete paralysis of every class and party. The Bolsheviksalone, who were mainly Jews, and were without all statesmanshipand knowledge of affairs, had at least shown a certain amount of decision. Their power was waning, but all observers of the Russiansituation, however much they disagreed in their views, were unitedin their conviction that without external intervention Russia could do nothing.Allied intervention in Siberia.7. The discussion which followed the Secretary of State&apos;s surveyturned mainly on the question of Allied intervention, moreparticularly with regard to the position of Japan and the UnitedStates of America in the matter.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointed out that japan would, in the last resort, always intervene in Eastern Siberiafor the protection of purely Japanese interests, if she thought those interests were affected by a German advance. She was not prepared,on the other hand, to carry out an Allied policy for the purpose ofreconstituting an Eastern front against Germany and saving asmuch of Russia as possible, unless she could secure the material and financial support which the United States could give. PresidentWilson&apos;s avowed objections hitherto had been, firstly, the fear thatthere might be a violent reaction in Russia against&apos;an interventionmainly carried out by troops of an Asiatic Power, and that this might drive Russia into Germany&apos;s arms-; . and, secondly, theabsence of sufficiently convincing military arguments that anything that could be done from Vladivostock could really affect the militarysituation sufficiently to prevent Germany withdrawing such troops as she otherwise would have withdrawn from Russia. He believedhimself that these avowed arguments were the arguments whichreally weighed with the President, although there*were many people who considered that Japanese unpopularity in the Western States,more particularly in California (whose vote was of considerable importance to the President), also exercised not a small influence onhis judgment.. Mr. Hughes informed the Imperial War Cabinet that he had discussed the matter with members of the Committee on foreign relations, appointed by President Wilson, and ?ixad found themdistinctly in favour of intervention, provided the operation was a
joint one and not conducted by Japan alone,. He wished to be sure that we had really pressed the United States Government sufficientlyin the matter the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs stated that theForeign Office had been pressing the American Government for months. So far the Presidents attitude had been definitely againstintervention, although he would not like to say that the door wasshut. He did not consider that it would be possible for the BritishGovernment to give the Japanese assurances in regard to munitions and finance which would enable them to go ahead without american support: Such action would only make a division in Allied policyevident, which would certainly be played upon in Russia andaccentuate hostility to the Japanese. He informed the imperial war Cabinet that the proposition he had placed before the japanese ambassador immediately after the last meeting of the Supreme WarCouncil at Versailles had not yet been answered.The Imperial War Cabinet requested  The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to make a further attempt to influence President Wilson by sending him adirect message from the Imperial War Cabinet to saythai it had considered the matter and was in favour of intervention.Conduct of Military 8. Mr. Hughes said that, although the Imperial War CabinetOperations. had had admirable reviews of the military and foreign situationsplaced before them by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff andthe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, it was futile for them toexpress an opinion on the war situation generally without muchfuller information as to what had actually happened and as to thereasons which had led up to the strategy which had expressed itself inthe previous year&apos;s operations with very heavy casualties. Australiahad poured out its men into the machine and- had had heavy losses,but had never had a scratch of a pen to explain what had really hap-happened. He wished to feel sure that the sacifiees that were being madewere not wasted for want of proper leadership and strategy. We were now in the same position as, or even possibly in a worse position than,before the battle of the Marne. If there had been blunders, it wasnecessary now, even at the eleventh hour, to repair them. Hesuggested that a comprehensive memorandum should be prepared,reviewing the whole situation.The Prime Minister said that the points raised by Mr. Hugheswere in effect a continuation of the discussion initiated by Sir robert borden (Imperial War Cabinet 16, Minute 7). He suggested that.the whole issue should be relegated for preliminary discussion to aCommittee consisting of the Prime Ministers, including general smuts, as General Botha&apos;s representative, and the Secretary of Statefor War, with the Chief of the Imperial General Staff if his presencewas required, and that this Committee should meet without delay.Any conclusions which the Committee might come to should thencome back to the Imperial War Cabinet for discussion.This suggestion was generally agreed to, and it was decidedthat-The Committee should meet at 12 o&apos;clock on the following day.The text of Mr. Balfoi;. s statement will be circulated in aseparate docement.. t2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,June 20, 1918.
