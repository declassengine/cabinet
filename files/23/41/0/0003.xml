Thj Western&apos;FrMit.s1. THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that theprevious day had been a comparatively quiet one. The french troops had been fighting well. Five of Prince Rupprecht&apos;sdivisions had been identified up to date-four on the isioyon-Montdidier sector, and the other one at Villers-Cotterets. One ofthese was presumably the division which had been reported aspassing through Lille a few days before. If these identificationswere correct, it left Prince Rupprecht with 96 divisions altogether,i.e., 52 in line and 44 in reserve. 21 of the divisions in reserve,and 22 of those in line, were quite fresh. The remainder had notyet.completed their months rest.In answer to a question, the Chief of the Imperial General staff said that 13 Germal divisions had been brought over from theEastern front since the beginning of the March offensive. Thepresent strength of the German infantry varied from 800 to 850 perbattalion, and the Germans were apparently trying to work up tothe latter standard.Finland.2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that therewas a report to the effect that one or one and a half german divisions were on their way through Finland towards Petchenga, onthe Murman coast.The Prime Minister suggested that this was probably theresult of reports current in Prussia to the effect that Murmansk wasbeing held by 20,000 British troops.The Caucasus. 3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that two German battalions had been reported as moving up from Batumto Tiflis.Submarine;:.-1. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that a seaplane had dropped bombs on a submarine off the Humber on the 13th June,and, observing oil and wreckage coming to the surface, summoneddestroyers by wireless, which dropped depth charges, which resultedin more wreckage coming to the surface.In a subsequent discussion the First Lord stated that the depthcharge and the gun were still the most effective weapons againstthe submarine for surface attack.Mr. Burton gave the Cabinet his experience of the effects of adepth charge which burst in the neighbourhood of the passengersteamer in which he arrived from South Africa.Bombing of Ostend 5. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that Ostend docks andand Zeebrugge.        Zeebrugge had again been freely bombed on the night of the12th-13th June. .H.M.S.&quot; Conquest.&quot; 6. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that H.M.S. &quot; Conquest &quot;had been mined off the Sunk Light Vessel on the previous day, but had managed to get to port; 1^ hours after she was mined a very heavy explosion was heard about 5 miles off, and, as the mine hadbeen laid only that same morning, it was probable that the explosionwas due to the German submarine being caught in our own.minefield.
H.M.S. &quot;Patia.&quot; 7. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that H.M.S. &quot;Patia&quot;had been torpedoed on the 13th instant, 34 miles from TrevoseHead. The United States destroyer &quot; Trippe&quot; had arrived atPembroke with 237 officers and men. It was presumed that.M.S. &quot;Patia &quot; was sunk.H.M.S. &quot;Centaur.&quot; 8. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that H.M.S. &quot; Centaur &quot;had been mined on the 13th June during a reconnaissance inHeligoland Bight, and was returning at slow speed.Black Sea Fleet.9. The Deputy First Sea Lord referred to the Russian wireless message, published that morning, according to which the RussianBlack Sea Fleet was ordered to return from Novorossisk to Odessa,the Germans having promised not to use it against the Allies.Sinking of twoAustrianDreadnoughts.Air Work inFrance.10. With reference to Imperial War Cabinet 16, Minute 6, the deputy First Sea Lord mentioned that the enemy now admitted the sinking of the &quot; Szent Istvan,&quot; the latest of the Austrian dread-noughts. &apos;11. The Chief of the Air Staff reported that the Air service had had a good week in France. Sixty enemy aeroplanes had beenbrought down, and 35 driven down out of control. Altogether,since the battle had started in March, we had destroyed 921 Germanplanes, and brought down 338 out of control. The British AirService were nowr helping the French on the Aisne front with a brigade of 10 squadrons (about 200 machines) to bomb theadvancing German troops. He understood that very gdod work was being done. The enemy also were reported to be 186 machinesstronger on the Aisne front and generally weaker on the rest ofthe Western front. Generally speaking, we were superior to theenemy both in numbers and in the quality of our machines. Ourown losses on the Western front, compared with the Germans,had been about one-third of the enemy&apos;s. The Germans had beenconstructing additional aerodromes near Cambrai about ten daysago, and were now busy on constructing and making more permanent aerodromes round Lille, presumably for work over thearea between Arras and the sea. The enemy were still doingheavy night bombing over our back areas, and we were making arrangements for machines to go out by night to deal with them.Misty weather had prevented any serious raiding into Germany by our bombing squadrons. The Germans, on their side, had probably been too active on their own front and had had their aerodromestoo much interfered with by us to be able to do anything against this country.In Italy we had brought down thirteen aeroplanes in the lastweek, and, generally speaking, Avere able to have more or less ourown way with the Austrians. The Italian aviators, though numerous,were not very enterprising.Anti-SubmarineAir Work.[530-3]12. General Sykes reported that there had been an increase of enemy aerial activity over the southern part of the North Searecently, presumably as an answer to our own anti-submarine airpatrols. With regard to the effectiveness of our own aerial anti-submarine patrols, General Sykes informed the Imperial WarCabinet that certainly three and possibly eleven submarines hadbeen directly destroyed by aircraft.Admiral Hope, explained that the value of aircraft lay not somuch in the submarines destroyed as in their effectiveness in keepingB 2
submarines below the surface. He mentioned that the traffic between this country and Holland was now escorted by flying-boats and seaplanes.The First Lord added that we had never yet had any shiptorpedoed when escorted by airships or kite-balloons.13. General Smuts gave a brief review of South Africa&apos;s effort in the war, drawing attention to &apos;tive peculiar features of that effortas regards the mainly African character of the operations and asregards the fact that the South African Government had not dis-couraged South Africans joining the Imperial forces, so that therewere probably as mam&apos; South Africans in the British forces on theWestern front as in the South African brigade there. As regardsthe political difficulties in South Africa, he had been told byMr. Burton that conditions were improving, on the whole, and thatno serious trouble was to be expected.General Smuts then surveyed the naval and military policy ofthe previous twelve months, setting forth in detail both the navaland military reasons which had led the Government to give theirassent to the 1917 offensive in Flanders. He commented on the reaction of these exhausting operations on the army, but pointedout that the disadvantages to the Navy of our failure to expel theenemy from Ostend and Zeebrugge had been mitigated temporarily,at any rate, by the recent blocking operations at these ports. Inregard to the existing military situation, he pointed out that we had now established a single command over the armies in France, andwere looking forward to the arrival of the American army. Thetemper of the British people had improved enormously since the summer of 1917 ; every blow had only hardened it, and their spiritwas one which could not be defeated. The United States, he knew,would show the same spirit, although he could not feel the sameabsolute certainty about the spirit of France,, which had beensuperb so far. The serious danger which he foresaw was the lackof training of the officers and staffs of the American army, and hetrusted that our Imperial General Staff would do all in their powerto help the Americans in that respect, as well as in the improvementof the training of our own forces, not only for trench warfare, whichwas, after all, a passing phase, but for open warfare. To sum up,we had superior resources in every form of war-power; all weneeded was improved organisation, training, and leadership. Itwas to these points that the energy of the Government would haveto be directed to the fullest extent, and, if they were secured, hehad no doubt that we could win the war.14. Mr. Lloyd said that he was circulating a brief state-ment of the effort made by Newfoundland, an effort which he hoped to be able shortly to double. They had recently passed a Compulsory Service Act on Canadian lines, and some 1,200volunteers had come in to anticipate conscription.15. After Mr. Montagu had referred to the fact that he had circulated a full statement of India&apos;s effort (Paper G.T.-4800),Sir S. Sinha briefly reviewed what India&apos; had done and was pro-posing to do in the matter of man-power, material, and finance.With regard to all these matters, he wished to urge the BritishGovernment to furnish India with the help required to enable her to put forward the fullest output of her powers. Thus, in respectof her effort in man-power, she wanted liberal assistance in thematter of British Staff and officers, not least, of medical officers.

The Secretary of State for the Colonies briefly reviewedColonies. the effort of the Crown Colonies, both in man-power, combatant and non-combatant, and in other respects. That effort had been a veryremarkable one. Nothing, moreover, was more remarkable than theproofs of loyalty and devotion which had been received from the natives of the Crown. Colonies in every part of the world. he wished to draw attention also to the position of natives in the occupied German territories, who had rendered great services to our troops, and were exposed to the risk of German reprisals if those territories were handed back to their former masters. Such a result would have a most unfortunate effect upon all the native populations of adjoining colonies.Future 17. The Prime Minister said that the statements made with arrangements. regard to the efforts of the Dominions had been highly gratifying.With reference to the momentous discussion, initiated by Sir R.Borden, as to the reasons why the hopes of 1917 had not been realised, it was quite clear to him that when these issues had been raised by representatives of Dominions who had contributed so large a share to the struggle, they could not be left where they were. Itwas necessary, however, that the views of Australia should also first be heard on these matters. He suggested that, after the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff had made his statement on Tuesday next,the present discussion might be continued by Mr. Hughes, whowould have the advantage of the full reports of the proceedings, and could also discuss the matter with Sir R. Borden. He himself, orthe Secretary of State for War, might by that time be able to make astatement on behalf of the British Government, and they could thenconfer as to the best method of dealing with the criticisms and suggestions brought forward.The text of the statements referred to in Minutes 13 to 17 willbe circulated in a separate document.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,June 14, 1918.o
