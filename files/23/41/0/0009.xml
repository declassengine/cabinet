Northern Kussia. 2. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that H.M.S. &quot; Attentive &quot;had visited Kandalaksha, Kem, and Soroka. At the latter place a force was landed, and was welcomed by local delegates. TheBolsheviks had retreated south, destroying the railway betweenSoroka and Kem, but H.M.S. &quot; Attentive,&quot; together with the militaryauthorities, were working at restoring the line, and hoped to com-plete it this week. Local support was assured, and the opposingforces appeared unwilling to resist an organised attack.Vladivostock. 3. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that a delayed reportfrom H.M.S. &quot; Suffolk &quot; stated that the Czech General had given asthe causes leading to the delivery of his ultimatum : the continuedattempts at pilfering arms and ammunition from the area guardedby the Czechs ; the attempt to send military stores to the Irkutskfront ; and the presence of armed enemy prisoners and enemy agentsiu the town. At a conference held on board H.M.S. &quot; Suffolk &quot; onthe 27th June, the British, Japanese, and French consuls had decided to request the representatives of the Siberian Flotilla, whowere present, to disarm their vessels and to guarantee the safety andlives of the crews. The disarmament had been effected on the30th June, at the request of the Siberian Flotilla and with theconsent of the Czech General, by the Japanese. A subsequenttelegram, dated the 6th July, reported that, after the delivery to the mayor of a proclamation, stating that the town and vicinity were under Allied protection, forces were landed from all the Allied shipspresent, including Americans, in order to patrol the place and toprovide a permanent force at Czech headquarters, to act in concert with the Czechs in case of any movement against them.Bombing Attacks. 4. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that an aerial attack was carried out against Constantinople on the 7th July, half a ton of bombs being dropped.   All our machines had returned safely.The Western &apos;Front.1. THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that, of100 German batteries which had been traced during the last sisweeks on their way to the Western front from the East, or fromthe interior of Germany, 88 had come to the British front. Therewas also a very considerable increase in the number of telegraph,telephone, and other engineer units coming to the British front.The German leave trains during the last three weeks going away from the front had been very light, while trains with troops returning from leave had been very full. Large numbers of machine-gununits had been sent to the school at Tongres, near Liege, for theirbattle training. Previous experience indicated that an attack would begin about a week after these units returned.Our own position would be weakened by the withdrawal of the six French divisions of the D.A.N. from General Plumer&apos;s Army.These were, however, being replaced by three American divisionsmoved up in rear of the line. From the point of view of infantry,the exchange was, if anything, an advantage, and General Plumerand his Staff felt happier with the American troops than with these particular French divisions. On the other hand, it involved aconsiderable weakening in guns.While the indications given above pointed to an attack againstthe British front, General Petaihs headquarters had just reportedthat they had practically made up their mind that the german attack would come in the Champagne between Rheims and theArgonne, the assumption being that the Germans would wish tosecure the line of the Marne between Chateau-Thierry and Chalonsin order to have a broader front for their subsequent attack againstParis.
61- tons of bombs wereDuring the night of 7th-8th Julydropped on Bruges and Ostend docks, canal,&apos;works, and aerodromesOne enemy aircraft was destroyed.    All our machines returned safely.The Air Situation.5. The Chief of the Royal Air Staff reported that. during thelast four days the British air forces with the armies on the western front had brought down 53 enemy aeroplanes, with a loss to ourselves of 11 machines. The Independent Force had, betweenthe 5th and 8th July, raided Coblenz, Saarbrucken, Kaiserslautern,and Luxemburg, bringing down. 4 machines with a loss of 2machines to ourselves. Aerial resistance over enemy towns was undoubtedly increasing, but there &quot;was no further confirmation of asuggestion thrown out in the last weekly air Report that the enemy were withdrawing aeroplanes from the front for this purpose.Meeting of theSupremeWar council at Versailles.Allied intervention in Russia.american co-operation.Salonica.Bulgaria.[530-9]6. The Prime Minister reported to the Imperial War Cabinetthat he had brought before the Supreme War Council the resolutionspreviously passed by the Imperial War Cabinet (Imperial WarCabinet 22, Minute 1), together with a preface stating the arguments in favour of intervention in Russia in a form which definitely threwon President Wilson the responsibility of a refusal. Both theresolutions and the preface were adopted by the Supreme WarCouncil, and were at once telegrap*hed to the Allied Ambassadors atWashington for presentation to President Wilson. Lord Readinghad had a first interview with the President, which had not beenvery satisfactory, and was to have had another on the 8th July, thereport of which had not yet come in. If the President shoulddefinitely refuse, a very serious decision would have to be faced.With regard to the question of American reinforcements, theBritish delegates, on arriving at Versailles, found the French hadtaken it upon themselves for M. Tardieu to make arrangements forthe next nine months for the bringing over of American troops.This was done without consulting the British Government, whofurnished two-thirds of the tonnage, and, indeed, without consultingGeneral Pershing. This had necessitated some plain speaking,after which the Supreme War Council decided, on the motion of theBritish delegates, that the question of tonnage was to be settledbetween the American and British Governments.With regard to the Balkans, the Supreme War Council had hadthe same experience of the French tendency to take things into their own hands without regard for the views of the Supreme WarCouncil. The latter had, on the 1st June definitely decided, on theadvice of the Military Representatives, in favour of a certain policyin the Balkans. . Two days before the present Meeting our military representative at Versailles was informed that orders had been sent from the French War Office to the General Commanding in macedonia involving an entire change in policy. Here, again, someplain speaking had been required, after which the matter was referred back to the Military Representatives for their consideration.In this connection the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs had hadto point out to the Supreme War Council the intimate connection ofthe diplomatic with, the military situation in the Balkans, and theresolution passed by the Supreme War Council provided for the examination of the diplomatic aspect of the question by a special representative of each of the Powers, to examine the matter inconjunction with the Military Representatives. Lord Robert Ceciland Lord Derby had been deputed for that task by the BritishGovernment, and the former was going over to Paris.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs amplified to theImperial War  Cabinet  the  arguments  affecting the diplomatic.   B2
(situation as regards. Bulgaria. He pointed out the various reasonsdisappointment with the prolongation of the war; the unpopularityof the representatives, both military and civil, of the German&quot; Super-Ally&quot; in Bulgaria ; the German holding back of the northernDobrudja, as a screw to extract concessions from Bulgaria; thepermanent friction on the frontier with Turkey ; the considerablehardships created by the exportation of food to the Central Powers;the recent change of Government, &amp;c- which might induce Bulgariato consider the possibility of making peace. There was also the strong reluctance of Bulgaria to face the definite hostility of theUnited States, from whom both Bulgaria and Turkey expected help to relieve them from their serious financial embarrassments after thewar. On the other hand, there were the obvious difficulties involvedin the natural distrust of Greece and Serbia of any concessions to&quot;Bulgaria which they feared would be made at their expense. Inhis opinion, it would be fatal to do anything to cool the zeal of our allies, more particularly if we did so with no security that we should get any result. It was essential that we should be thoroughlycandid with a man like M. Venizelos. In any case, Mr. Balfourconsidered that the attitude of Bulgaria, and that of Germany&apos;sallies generally, and, indeed, of many neutrals, would be one ofwatchful expectancy. until it was definitely established that theGerman boast of breaking down the western front this summer had failed of its fulfilment.As an illustration of the French methods referred to by thePrime Minister, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs mentioned that the French Ambassador had come to him on the previous day with a written scheme from M. Pichon dealing with the proposedintervention in Siberia, under certain headings. The first of theseheadings laid down that the intervention should take place underthe auspices of an American or French High Commissioner. on mr. Balfour&apos;s pointing this out to M. Cambon and enquiring whyGreat Britain was ignored, M. Cambon had replied that this was what &quot; these bureaucrats do,&quot; and had crossed out the words &quot; orFrench.&quot;Strike of -     7. With reference to the present strike of aeroplane workers,Aeroplane the Minister of Munitions mentioned that he was seeing the repre-Workers. sentatives of the men that afternoon, &apos;and hoped that he would beable to dispose of the matter satisfactorily. If not, he wouldprobably have to prosecute, as it would be a plain case whereprosecution woiilcl be necessary (Paper G.T.-5055).Imperial WarCabinet Agenda.Peace Terms.S. With regard to the future business of the Imperial WarCabinet, the Secretary pointed out that the only general statements which had not yet been made or discussed were those on munitions,finance, and man-power. Very full papers had already been circulated as regards the latter by the Minister of National Serviceand by the oversea members, and a further discussion by theImperial War Cabinet might not be necessary.There was some discussion as to the best manner in which thequestion of peace terms should be approached by the Imperial WarCabinet. General Smuts mentioned that he was writing a paper onthe German colonies, and Lord Curzon suggested that it would bedesirable that there should be a brief statement as regards the developments which had taken place since last year in startingthe foundations of the future system of Arab autonomy inMesopotamia, Arabia, &amp;c.
The Imperial War Cabinet decided that The Minister of Munitions should make his statement onThursday, the 11th July.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs undertook to make ageneral statement on Tuesday, the 16th July, as regardsterms of peace, taking as his basis last year&apos;s discussions and the reports of Lord CurzoAs and Lord MilnersCommittees, and indicating how far the conclusions thenarrived at had been affected by subsequent military andpolitical developments.2, Whitehall Gardens. 8.
