The western front.1. THE Director of Military Intelligence reported that the totalnumber of fresh divisions in reserve under Prince Rupprecht nowstood at 33.The Italian Front.2. The Director of Military Intelligence reported that theItalians had made an attack with light forces on Mount Asolone onthe afternoon of the 25th instant, but had stopped when they met with strong resistance. On the Piave front the Italians had abandoned the attempt to make a bridgehead at Ponte di Piave andhad withdrawn their patrols. Some fighting was still going on inthe area between the old and the new Piave.Russia and Finland.3. The Director of Military Intelligence stated that GeneralPoole now reported that there were only quite small enemy parties in the neighbourhood of Kem. On the other hand, there was agood deal of movement in Southern Finland, which indicated apossible intention of an attack across Lake Ladoga towards theZvanka-Petrozavodsk section of the Murman line. According to a french report, the Czechs were investing Ekaterinburg. this might possibly account for the reported murder of the Czar. TheDirector of Military Intelligence added that his information was thatGeneral Mackensen was still in the Ukraine, where the germans had a good deal of guerilla warfare to contend with.Persia and the 4. The Director of Military Intelligence reported that he hadCaucasus. received a telegram from General Marshall, to the effect that GeneralDunsterville was going to meet General Bicharakoff at Enzeli on the-26th instant, which indicated that the latter had not, by thatdate, gone back to Baku. Near Baku the Bolshevist garrisonhad, on the 2(.ith June, defeated the Tartars west of Kurdamir,80 miles west of Baku, and taken three guns. They were busymaking entrenchments round Baku. The Director of military intelligence added that the difficulties between Turks and germans in the Caucasus had not been settled, but that General von Kress, theGerman Commissioner, had probably now arrived in the Caucasus.The Germans were transporting manganese from Batum to Braila.Submarines. 5. The  Director  of   the  Intelligence   Division,  Admiralty,reported that the German mine-laying submarine &quot;U.C. 11,&quot; whichhad been laying mines off the coast for two years past, was sunk byexplosion on &quot;the morning of the 26th June, east of Harwich. Therewas one survivor, the captain. The submarine attacked and reportedsunk by an armed trawler on the previous clay (War Cabinet 436,Minute 12. was now reported as probably only slightly damaged.Bombing Raids. 6. The  Director   of   the  Intelligence   Division,   Admiralty,reported that there had been no night Hying possible, owing to bad weather, but bombs had been dropped by day on Bruges docks,Ostehd docks, and Zeebrugge.7. The Director of the Intelligence Division, Admiralty,stated that the report that a Russian dreadnought and five destroyers had been sunk at Novorossisk was so far unconfirmed.The Air Situation. 8. The Chief of the Royal Air Staff reported that reconnais-sances had given no further indications as to the whereabouts of the impending German attack on the Western front.

9. The Prime Minister drew the attention of the Imperial WarCabinet to communications he had received from the Lord Mayor of liverpool, and from Mr. Ben Tillett, M.P., with regard to the recep-tion of American troops in Liverpool. Mr. Tillett stated that theAmerican lighting men were astounded at the cold reception theymet with, and that there was much dissatisfaction.Sir Robert Borden, Mr. Massey, and Mr. Lloyd stated that their experience was that the American troops met with a tremendousreception coming up the river from other ships and from crowds onthe bank.It was pointed out that the real difficulty wras that the navaland military authorities did not feel themselves justified in givingsufficient notice ahead of the arrival of the transports to enable acivic reception to take place. It was stated, on the other hand, thatno long notice was really required for an informal reception by the mayor and as many of his Councillors as might be available, and itwas urged that an effort should be made to arrange that sufficientnotice should be given for this purpose. It was suggested at thesame time that the Minister for Information should take steps to have it made clear in the United States press why notice of the arrival of american troops could not be given in time for a formal welcome.The Secretary of State for War undertook to look into thematter with reference to the amount of notice which themilitary landing authorities could give to the municipalauthorities.The Secretary was instructed to communicate to the Minister ofInformation the suggestion that the difficulties of thematter should be made clear to the American press.Allied Intervention 10. The Imperial War Cabinet discussed draft resolutions, pre-in Siberia. pared by the Committee of Prime Ministers with a view to theirsubmission to the Supreme War Council at its forthcoming meetingat Versailles, on the subject of Allied intervention in Siberia.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read to the imperial war Cabinet a telegram just received from Lord Reading, who had seen President Wilson on the subject, to the effect that the president would only agree to intervention in the guise of a Relief Commission.He was, however, now prepared to accept the. idea that the ReliefCommission should be escorted by an armed guard, which he con-sidered should be mainly American, supplemented by Japanese andother Allied troops. He was not yet convinced of the desirability ofa purely military and mainly Japanese intervention. Mr. Balfouralso read to the Imperial War Cabinet another telegram, which had just been received from Lord Derby, to the effect that, in addition to- the telegram already sent by General Foch to President Wilson,M. Clemenceau had now telegraphed to President Wilson urgingimmediate intervention, on the grounds of the duty of the Allies to rescue the Czechs, and laying stress on the fact that only threemonths remained before the beginning of winter. M. Clemenceauhad, in fact, completely altered his position in the last twenty-four hours, and was now in agreement with the policy of using the czechs as the vanguard of the Allied force in Russia. Lord Derbyhad also been informed by M. Pichon that our consul at Vladivostockwas arming the Czechs there for self-defence. The telegram furthercontained information that M. Tardieu was putting forward a pro-posal for discussion at the Supreme War Council, based on the idea that the active army of intervention should be Japanese and com-[530-7] B 2Reception of american Troops.bombs had been dropped on the preceding night on Tournai andCambrai railway stations. Six submarines had been sighted and attacked by our air patrols from the east coast.
manded by a Japanese General, that the Allied contingents shouldbe under a High Commissioner, to be decided upon among theGovernments, and be used for lines of communications and gendar-morie purposes, and that there should be a special Commission todeal with commercial matters.    .      .The Imperial War Cabinet discussed both these telegrams intheir bearing upon the proposed resolutions. The general view taken was that, while there was nothing inconsistent with theresolutions in the idea of a Relief Commission, and that this might be the easiest way of getting President Wilson further com-mitted, the Presidents proposal as it stood was inadequate, and thatthere could be no question of whittling down the policy decided on as a matter of urgency, simply to please the President. WT it h regardto M. TardieAs proposals, it was felt that, while they were hardlypracticable as they stood, it might be possible to harmonise themboth with an effective policy of intervention and with PresidentWilsoAs ideaof a Relief Commission.The Prime Minister summed up by pointing out that there were,in substance, two quite different proposals: the one suggested that intervention should take place under American command, in the shape of a small and ineffective force, and after a long period of delayinvolved by the lack of American shipping on the Pacific ; and theother, early intervention by a well-equipped powerful force, capableof making its way through to the Urals. This, for practical reasons,would have to be predominantly a Japanese force. He considered it essential that we should express our view quite definitely anddistinctly to President Wilson, in favour of the second of these alternatives, lie considered that an additional paragraph might very well be added to the draft resolutions, advocating the sending of a relief expedition under American command, but he thought it of great importance that the President should not commit himself in public in favour of his present idea, before he heard the considered views of the Supreme War Council.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs undertook to telegraph to Lord Reading to ask President Wilson not to commit himself on this matter before hearing from Versailles. he also undertook to see that a summary of M. Kerensky&apos;s interview with the Prime Minister should be sent to president Wilson, if that had not already been done.It was also urged that it was necessary not to forget theJapanese point of view in this whole matter. The proposition asput to them so far was not a very attractive one, which naturallymade them all the more anxious to be certain of the complete andcordial support of the United States, upon which they dependedfor material and financial assistance in carrying through the expedition. It was suggested that Japan was looking not merely for territorial reward, but also for more definite recognition of herstatus as an Ally.The Prime Minister mentioned, in this connection, that he hadalready suggested to the Japanese Ambassador that, in the event of japanese intervention in Siberia, Japan would, no doubt, be invitedto participate in the deliberations of the Supreme War Council at versailles.Further discussion took place with regard to the resolutions,more particularly from the point of view of simplifying the paragraphreferring to the geographical necessity of intervention being mainlyJapanese, and from that of making the request from the supreme war Council to President Wilson in a form which would definitelyput him in the position of having either to accept or refuse therecommendations. ^The Imperial War Cabinet decided that The draft resolutions should be further amended and re-considered at the next meeting on the afternoon of Friday,the 28th June.
Answer toM. Kerensky.11. The Prime Minister raised the point whether he ought notto give a definite answer to the questions which had been put tohim by M. Kerensky in their recent interview.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and Lord robert cecil both laid stress on the importance of giving no official answer to M. Kerensky in a form which would commit the British Govern-ment to attempt to re-establish M. Kerensky, or to being regarded in Russia as specially tied to him. There was,- however, no reason why an unofficial answer should not be given to M. Kerensky,makine- clear the intentions of the British Government.Pacifist Literature.12. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew theattention of the Imperial War Cabinet to the circulation of amischievous pamphlet issued by the Union of Democratic Control,entitled &quot; Peace Overtures and their Rejection.&quot;Mr. Walter Long, acting on behalf of the Secretary of State for home Affairs, undertook to make arrangements for stopping the circulation of the pamphlet in question.review of theNaval Situation.13. The Firs-:t Sea Lord gave a general review of the naval situation, both with regard to the position of the surface fleets inthe North Sea and the Mediterranean, and with regard to themeasures for dealing with the submarine menace. In the latterconnection he drew attention to the extensive use made of scientificassistance in every direction, and to the progressive destruction andharassing of the submarines, who were gradually beingfrom the hunters into the hunted.changed the german colonies.14. In the course of his review, the First Sea Lord drew special attention to the naval problems involved in the question of theretention or return of the German colonies. The chief developments of the present war had been in the direction of submarines and aircraft, for both of which bases could be much more easily andquickly created than for other craft. In this respect any danger that the German colonies presented to our maritime position beforethe war would be greatly increased after the war if they were returned.Future Naval 15. The First Sea Lord also drew the attention of the ImperialCo-ordination. War Cabinet to the Admiralty memorandum on the Naval Defenceof the British Empire (Paper G.T.-4571). He said that theAdmiralty had approached the subject with some trepidation in sofar as it touched upon political ground. While fully realising theneed of decentralisation of administration, as executive officers theywere strongly impressed by the ideal of a single Navy and unity of command. The importance of co-ordination and unity of command had been one of the chief lessons of the present war, and was truein the naval as well as in the military sphere. In dealing with thismatter the Admiralty had attempted to approach it from the widerpoint of view of the partnership of the nations of the Empire, andhad to a certain extent taken the constitution of the Imperial WarCabinet as their guide. In any case, they had not put forward theirviews in any spirit of dogmatism, or with the idea of expecting a- definite answer at once, but with the hope of getting their viewsconsidered, and bringing about as soon as possible an agreement on general principles which could afterwards be elaborated into a working system. The points on which he wished more particularly. to enlarge were, in the first place, the need of central control inpeace. Naval peace arrangements, owing to the far greater mobility of naval warfare, had necessarily to be in much closer accordance
with war plans than military peace arrangements. If each part ofthe Empire developed a separate naval strategy in peace, it would beimpossible to secure effective co-operation in war. If our navalarrangements had not been completely ready in July 1914, thefortunes of the war might have been very different. Unity of navalstrategy could only be secured by a central authority. The sameapplied with regard to the need for uniformity of training. Heinstanced a report from Vice-Admiral Sims-, who pointed out that theAmerican ships; although in all respects efficient when they came tojoin the British naval forces, were no real addition of strength possibly the reverse-until they had learned to adopt the samemethods and work on precisely the same system as the British ships.The Admiralty considered that, from this point of view, the ships ofthe Empire Navy should be available in any waters; and theofficers of that Navy available to serve in any ship. Similarly,it was desirable to have uniformity of material, especially from thepoint of view of prompt replenishment of reserves, and, above all,unity of thought and idea, and the maintenance intact of the greattraditions oh which the Navy had been built up. He againemphasised that the need for unity in these respects did not in theleast apply to questions of administration.The Prime Minister suggested that this very important questionof naval co-ordination should be considered direct between theAdmiralty and the Dominion Prime minister-s, and, if general questions of principle arose, the matter might be brought back tothe Imperial War Cabinet for discussion.Sir Robert Borden stated that he had no objection to a general discussion of this subject between the Dominion representatives andthe Admiralty, although there might be some matters of detail that canada would wish to discuss with the Admiralty separately.It Avas generally agreed that, although action in this matter could not be taken until after the war, it would be of great use tothe Admiralty, and advance matters, if a preliminary discussioncould take place while the Dominion representatives were in thiscountry, either at the Imperial War Conference or at the Admiralty.Owing to its secrecy, the text of Admiral Wemyss&apos; statementwill not be circulated, but a copy is on record in the personalcustody of the Secretary of the War Cabinet, and can be read at theWar Cabinet Offices on application to the Secretary.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,June 27, 1918.o
