he Western Front. 1. THE Director of Military Operations reported that there were. a great many indications of a German attack on both sides of Rheims ;so many, in fact, that the Director of Military Intelligence was inclined to be sceptical and to think that they were deliberatelybeing furnished by the Germans. There were certainly very definiteindications of the reinforcement of the German heavy artillery in flanders, and the Germans might also be influenced in their choice of points selected for attack by the knowledge that the divisions ofthe French D A.N. had been withdrawn from our front.American Co- -      % Director of Military Operations reported that all fiveoperation. American divisions training with the British army were now con-sidered fit to hold back lines. In answer to questions as to the location of the other American divisions, the Director of MilitaryOperations stated that twelve of these were in line or effectivelyforming part of the French army, while another five were in various stages of training in rear of the French army.There was some discussion as to the total effective combatantstrength of the American troops in France.The Prime Minister quoted the figures of our mission at Americanheadquarters, which gave the total strength on the 26th June as820,000, of which only 271,000 were rifles, or, say, 350,000, includingmachine-guns.Some doubt was expressed how far General Pershing had, asa matter of fact, carried out. the agreement that the troops broughtover during the last three months should have been mainly infantry and machine-gunners. It was also suggested that the French,with their not unnatural anxiety for the safety of Paris, were keepingan undue proportion of the American troops behind their own line.The Prime Minister stated that the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff had proposed to wrrite a letter to General Foch draw-ing attention to these points, and, more generally, to the over-whelming weight of the attack which the Germans might be ableto put against us. He considered that, instead of this letter going toGeneral Foch from the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, it shouldbe a report from the latter to the Imperial War Cabinet, and that thePrime Minister should, on behalf of the Imperial War Cabinet, sendit himself to General Foch, or, alternatively, should write toM. Clemenceau, inviting him to support General Wilson&apos;s repre-sentation to General Foch. It would be useful in this manner to remind General Foch that he was not merely a French but an allied commander-in-Chief, and responsible to the British as well as tothe French Government.The Imperial War Cabinet agreed that The Prime Minister should take one of the courses of actionsuggested.The New Tanks. 3. The Director of Military Operations reported that the new-Mark V Tanks had been in action for the first time in the recent. . c engagement at Hamel, and had been most favourably reported on.The experience which the Australians had had of the old type of tanks last year had not been very favourable. This time their experience had been very different, and the Australian troops had shown themselves to be very quick in learning how to co-operate effectively with the tanks.Albania. - 4. The Director of Military Operations reported that the news from Albania was very satisfactory.   The Italians had just takenBerat, capturing 1,500 prisoners, and there was some hope that the&quot; Italian cavalry advancing up the valley of the Semeni might cut off
a good many more of the Austrian force retreating from Berat.This success not only shortened the line considerably, but affordedextra protection to Valona, and would tend to clear the French flankso as to make it possible for the French to operate round to thenorth of Lake Ochrida.In this connection the Deputy First Sea Lord reported that theItalian operations had been greatly assisted by the monitors &quot; earl of Peterborough&quot; and &quot; Sir Thomas Picton,&quot; and by the Royal AirForce, whose machines co-operated not only from Valona, but alsoacross the Adriatic from Taranto and Otranto.The Air Situation. 5. The Chief of the Royal Air Staff reported that the weatherhad been unfavourable for reconnaissance work, but that some45 tons of explosives had been dropped on naval and military objectives. The enemy had attacked Dunkirk on the night of 7th-8th July, without inflicting casualties or damage. Since thelast report we had brought down forty-two enemy machines asagainst a loss of ten British machines.Statement by the 6. The Minister of Munitions presented to the Imperial WarMinister of Cabinet a general survey of the work, past and prospective, of hisMunitions. Department.   He pointed out, at the outset, that his department was not responsible for the munitions requirements of the Admiralty,which had a separate establishment of its own, about one-fifth of the size of the Ministry of Munitions. This duplication of Departmentsled to difficulties with regard to labour and contracts, and to considerable friction. He admitted that there were great practicaldifficulties in&apos; the way, but if this duplication could be dispensed with it might be possible to effect one of the few large remainingeconomies possible in the matter of man-power and production.In his view, the best system would be one under which the three fighting services, i.e., the Navy, the Army, and the Royal Air Force,drew for their man-power upon alsingle Department the Departmentof National Service and for their supplies from a single Munitions -Department.The whole work of munitions depended, he pointed out, uponthe two main factors of labour and tonnage. The total number ofpersons employed in munitions, including xidmiralty munition work,was 3,400,000, of whom 980,000 were women. Of these, 2,000,000men and 750,000 women were employed under the Ministry ofMunitions. The essentially patriotic character of labour was shown by the fact that labour troubles immediately diminished when thesituation at the front became critical. The total number of dayslost by strikes during the preceding year had been more than made good by the voluntary surrender of the Easter holidays, which theworkers had made after the crisis of the 21st March. The Depart-ment was, in fact, 1,000,000 days&apos; working time in credit over the transaction. At the same time he wished to point out that labour had been increasingly disturbed by the process of substitution anddilution, which had been ceaselessly at work and cut many of their most treasured traditions. In this respect, the limit was very nearly reached, ond he urged that we should run the risk of makinga great mistake if we overstrained our resources of scientificproduction.As regards tonnage, Mr. Churchill pointed out that the ShippingController had enabled him practically to maintain, during thepresent year, the standard of 1,000,000 tons a month which hehad maintained throughout 1917, and which he proposed to take as his basis for calculations for 1919. Two-thirds of this tonnageconsisted of steel and explosives, or the raw materials required for making them. The steel budget of the Ministry of Munitions forthe current year amounted to 8,000,000 tons, of which the Admiralty[530-10] B 2
took 2,500,000 for its Own purpose and for shipbuilding; 2,000,000were required for shells ; 1,000,000 for War Office requirements,including railways ; 1,000.000 for other munitions for the Royal AirForce and the construction of tanks ; and 1,500,000 for the civil needsof the country. He gave figures showing the very large increase inthe volume of shell which could be hurled at the enemy per week as compared with the earlier period of the war, but suggested thatin this respect the effective limit had been reached, and the bestline of advance lay not in trying to increase the gross bulk, but by securing greater range out of the guns, in order to get a more effective volume of concentration of projectiles, both for attack and defence. In this connection he gave some details with regard tothe new British field gun, and to the arrangements contemplatedfor improving the range and life of our heavy guns, as well as withregard to certain special types of artillery required for particularpurposes. Drawing attention to the ease with which the 1,200 gunslost in March had been replaced, and giving the figures of the substantial reserve immediately available, and of the heavy gunswith which he had promised to. equip the American forces, he mentioned that the output of new and repaired guns during theweek ending the 15th June last was practically double the outputof the twelve months preceding the outbreak of the war ; in other words, an increase of 10,000 per cent, in output capacity. Ourrifle position, which had been a great factor of delay in 1914,now presented no difficulties. We had an ample output and avery large reserve. In addition to that, we had a large stock of Russian rifles for whose manufacture we had arranged inAmerica, and which we had now available either as an additionalreserve or for any contingencies which might occur in Russia.With regard to machine-guns, he mentioned that the output ofthe preceding week was two and a half times as great asthe total number of machine-guns in existence with the british army at the outbreak of war. The figures of output were now onsuch a scale that any change of type involved most serious diffi-culties. Even to start the production of a new type took something like twelve to eighteen months. The Ministry of Munitions and theWar Office had, therefore, come to the decision not to make anychange in existing types of machine-guns, but, in so far as they madea change at all, to proceed direct to the manufacture of the newautomatic rifle.The explosives position was very good, and we could open out our present output very considerably if required. The only weakfeature in it was the dependency on Chile for nitrates, which involved a very long journey and the locking up of much tonnage. We were proceeding with extraction of nitrates from the air, but could onlydo so on a moderate scale, unlike Germany, which had laid herselfout earlier for this type of production and was able to supply notOnly her war needs, but her agriculture, A very marked feature inthe development of the war was the progressive increase in the useof chemicals, more particularly the various types of poison gas.Mr. Churchill gave some details and figures of the development inthis direction, and pointed out the bearing of this new type of warfare upon the general battle tactics which would have to beadopted.With regard. to aeroplanes, Mr. Churchill mentioned that the detailed figures had already been given by Lord Weir on theprevious occasion. f He only wished to draw special attention to thevery serious reduction in the output of engines during the last three months, consequent on the taking of skilled men out of theaircraft factories for the&apos;Army. His present output was only some70 per cent, of what he had hoped to obtain.Lord Weir agreed as to the seriousness of the labour position,but expressed the view that if the &quot; Liberty &quot; motor came in in asatisfactory quantity the skilled labour position might be saved.
5IWG 24Mr. Churchill mentioned that he and Lord Weir were settingup a searching statistical investigation in order to make sure thatthe Royal Air Force was getting full value out of the total numberof machines supplied.With regard to railways, Mr. Churchill considered that the margin had been run too fine, and that a larger allocation of material would become necessary.With regard to the tank programme, again, large as it was, he did not consider it sufficiently large, and added that here, again, theloss of labour was pfej udicing the situation.Mr. Churchill paid a special tribute to the remarkable develop-ment in the production of munitions in Canada, pointing out thatdistance and shortage of tonnage had prevented Australia doingmore in the direct production of munitions, although she hadfurnished an invaluable contribution in the matter of raw material.The production of India had been small, up to date, but the possibili-ties were being explored for development of a plant capable of supplying 15 divisions. This did not seem to him sufficient, inview of the possibility of the war lasting to 1920 and extendingtowards the frontiers of India. He considered that the Ministryof Munitions and the India Office should meet together and prepare a large scheme for the development of big munition plants inIndia, capable of dealing with such a contingency. His atten-tion had been drawn to this important matter by Sir S. Sinha&apos;remarks at a previous meeting (Imperial War Cabinet 17,Minute 15).Mr. Churchill summed up his review by pointing out that therewere really two general questions which had to be answered : (a.) How we were to use our remaining resources of men andmaterial for the supreme moment of the war, and tomaintain the strength of the British Empire ;(b.) How we were to defeat the German armies on the western front, and whether we could do this in 1919 or wouldhave to wait until 1920.To wait until 1920 involved exposing India to serious risks.At the same time, the greatest difficulty with which we were con-fronted was that of impatience; it was essential that we shouldchoose our climax well ahead, and subordinate all that we did inbetween to that climax. It was clear, in his view, that man-poweralone could not secure a decision on the Western front in 1919,especially as the Germans had opportunities for methodical retreatwhich were denied to us in our present situation. Success, in hisopinion, could only be secured by the development of the scientific and mechanical side of warfare. He looked to a great vehicularattack, fighting tanks accompanied by large numbers of cross-country vehicles, and to air superiority, to achieve our object. Ifthis was sound as a matter of general Allied policy, it was obviouslysound from the purely British point of view. Moreover, with regardto the Americans, the limiting factor now was not either men, noreven tonnage, but equipment. It was essential that we should be&apos;in a position to furnish that equipment. He earnestly begged theImperial&apos;War Cabinet to consider whether we had not reached thelimit in drawing man-power away from munitions.A short discussion followed on the point raised by Mr. Churchillin the concluding part of his review. It was pointed out that thewithdrawal of skilled labour from munitions could not be dissociatedfrom the general problem of recruiting, which had involved the calling up of men of older age and had made it very difficult tokeep men of the younger ages in munitions. The policy adoptedby the British War Cabinet had only been adopted after muchdeliberation and in an extreme emergency, which was now beingrelieved by the arrival of the American divisions.The Prime Minister mentioned that the question of the character
of the coming year&apos;s operations had been specially referred, by aresolution of the last meeting of the Supreme AVar Council, to theMilitary Representatives at Versailles, who were the only bodyabsolutely free and untrammelled by urgent current work. Thematter, however, was also being considered by the British ImperialGeneral Staff. In answer to a suggestion of Mr. Hughes that thematter required considering from the particular standpoint of theBritish Empire as well, and that definite conclusions ought to bereached before the Prime Ministers separated and went back to theirown Dominions, the Prime Minister agreed that it would be desirablethat the matter should be fully discussed by the Committee of prime Ministers. He suggested that the General Staff should firstproduce its own preliminary report as a basis for the Committee&apos;discussions.The Director of Military Operations undertook to produce sucha report by the 18th or 19th July.The Imperial War Cabinet decided that The question of future military policy and of the allocation ofour man-power shoidd be discussed by the Committee of prime Ministers as soon as the General Staff had furnishedits report.The Minister of Munitions undertook to get into touch with theSecretary of State for India and the Indian members ofthe Imperial War Cabinet, with a view to preparing ascheme for the development of India&apos;s munition output,having regard to the possibilities of the war beingprolonged to 1920 and extending farther Eastwards.The Secretary drew attention to the fact that there had been some doubt as to the precise wording of the resolution of theSupreme War Council referred to by the Prime Minister, and suggested that it would be desirable to telegraph to the british military Representative at Versailles to push on with his study ofthe campaign for the coming year, without waiting for that point to&apos;be settled.The Imperial War Cabinet instructed-The Secretary to telegraph as suggested.[Owing to its secrecy, the text of Mr. Churchills statement willnot be circulated, but a copy is on record in the personal custody ofthe Secretary of the War Cabinet, and can&apos; be read at the War-Cabinet offices on application to the Secretary.]2, Whitehall Gardens, 8.W.,July 12, 1918.o
