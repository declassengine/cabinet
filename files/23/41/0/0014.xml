The Western 1. THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that oneFront.     - more division from Prince Rupprecht&apos;s army had been identified onthe German battle front, making a total of nine. This left twenty-seven fresh divisions on the whole German front, of which twenty-one were with Prince Rnpprecht. During the counter-offensivefour British and seven American divisions had been engaged. Thetotal number of prisoners taken from the enemy was probably not far short of 30,000. The Germans were putting up a very goodfight during their retreat.Air Operations:Imbros.Attack onAerodrome,2. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that an air attack was;made on Sunday, the 28th July, on R.A-F. aerodrome, Imbros,resulting in the total destruction of one Bessbneau hangar and the seven Sopwith Camels it contained.   There were no casualties.Goflatantiaople.of the  attention of the Imperial War Cabinet was called to thedesirability of carrying on bombing operations on Constantinople.The Chief bf the Air Staff said that it had been decided tothe units at Mudros for this work.strengthenMan Power:Munition Workers&apos;Strike.,4. With reference to War Cabinet 451; Minute ll, the Ministerof Munitions reported that the strike among the munition workersagaih&amp;t the embargo on the employment of skilled men was at aneAd; and the Gbverfihieht committee appointed to enqtiire into tHebelt method bi working the embargo would meet on the following day. The strike ivas remarkable, not only as showing the great power bf public opinion, but also the influence exercised bydischarged sailors and soldiers in bringing the strike to a speedyend.The Prime Minister,.in congratulating the Minister of Muni-tions, said that a noticeable feature of the industrial situation wasthe increasing cleavage between the skilled and unskilled workers.Exchange ofPrisoners of War.R5. With reference to War Cabinet 445, Minute 6, the imperial war Cabinet had before them an Agreement arrived at betweendelegates of the British and German Governments concerningthe exchange of combatant prisoners of war and civilians(Paper G.-219), which now required to be ratified by the Govern-ment in order to be put into effect.The Prime Minister asked whether there was any doubt aboutthe desirability of ratifying this Agreement.The First Sea Lord said that the Admiralty had one very important objection, inasmuch as in Article 2 there was a clausemissing, which related to the exchange of submarine officers andbrews. The missing clause provided that there should be nosuch exchange.Sir George Cave explained that the exception was in the original draft, but he was informed that, by a printers error, it had been dropped out, and steps were being taken to rectify the omission.The Agreement (without this exception) had, however, been signed by the delegates of both countries, and there was a possibilityof the Germans denying that the omission was a mistake.Some doubt was expressed as to whether it would be possiblefor the British Government to refuse their sanction to an agreement which the British delegates had signed, if the Germans insisted that this clause had not been left out in error. In particular, itwas pointed out that it would be extremely difficult to defend inParliament a refusal, based on these grounds, to ratify the Agree-ment. It was explained that there were only twenty-five german submarine officers in Holland to whom this clause applied.   The
IWC 28ISFirst Sea Lord pointed out, however, that the German submarineofficers were very highly trained men, and Germany would gain a tremendous advantage if her captured officers were enabled toreturn and train others in this very technical work. &apos; The relativesuccess we had achieved in our anti-submarine campaign was to agreat extent due to the lack of training of a large part of the crews of German submarines, and consequently the return of twenty-fiveexperienced submarine officers, available as instructors, would exercise an effect out of all proportion to their numbers.The Imperial War Cabinet took note of the First Sea Lord&apos;sserious objection to the ratification of the Agreement unless thecorrection referred to -was made. Insomuch, however, as verylarge questions of policy and considerable Parliamentary difficulties are involved in, a proposal to destroy, by refusing to ratify, anAgreement which has been actually sighed, they considered that, ifthe protest is to be pressed, it must be made formally by the FirstLord of the Admiralty.The Imperial War Cabinet decided that (a.) The Hague Prisoners Agreement should be ratified on theunderstanding that the portion bf article 2 relating tosubmarine prisoners, which had been omitted by a,  , . prihter&apos;s error, should be restored:(b.) The correction of this printer&apos;s error should not be pressed to the point of Our declining to ratify the Agreement ifthe enemy edtild hbt be induced to admit the error.Treatment ofBritish Prisonersof Warin Germany and holland.6 The Director of Military Intelligence then raised the questionbf the ill-treatment of our men by the Germans because they refusedto do certain work which they regarded as not. distinctly connectedwith the operations of war. Although this question was not directlyconnected with the Agreement under discusslbn, he thought thatthe phrase &quot; work connected with the operations of war &quot; should bemore distinctly defined.Some discussion followed as to the meaning of this phrase, andit was generally agreed that, in these days, it was very difficult tofind any work for prisoners of war which was not connected withthe war.The Imperial War Cabinet decided that (a.) As this question was not directly connected with the Agree-ment, it should be dealt with as a separate question.(6.) The Director of Military Intelligence should prepare amemorandum, endeavouring to define more precisely themeaning of the phrase &quot; work connected with the opera-tions of war,&quot; and should place himself in communicationwith the Prisoners of War Department, with a view toconcerting such action as might be -deemed expedientand practicable.7. The Imperial War Cabinet had before them notes of state-ments and suggestions made by Miss Vulliamy regarding thetreatment of British prisoners of war in Germany and Holland(G.T.-5083;, and a memorandum by Sir George Cave (Paper G.T.-5135) on the same subject.Sir George Cave stated that Miss Vulliamy&apos;s suggestion No. would have been met by the suggestion made at the Hague that15,000 privates should be first exchanged, but he understood thatthis had been given up at the request of the Dutch Government.Miss Vulliamy&apos;s suggestions Nos. 2 to 4 would be met if the HagueAgreement were ratified by the Government.With regard to suggestion No. 5 (b), in which it was suggestedthat we should use German officer prisoners, and especially those ofaristocratic connections, as a lever through which to get proper
treatment for our own privates, the Prime Minister said that thisraised a very difficult question, and he thought it should be very seriously considered.Sir Robert Borden stated that he had recently interviewed acertain number of Canadian officers who had returned from prisonercamps in Germany. These officers had assured him that it wasuseless for us in this country to practise severity against the Germanrank and file, but that if we retaliated on their officers, especiallyofficers of the German aristocracy, there would be very differentresults. The treatment of our officers and men in some of theGerman prisoner camps amounted to slow assassination. he admitted that wre could not compete with the Germans in brutality,but he thought that we should do something to stiffen the treatmentof the German nobility.The Prime Minister said that Germany might reply that wewere deliberately starving their country, and that therefore theycould not undertake to feed: prisoners of war better than their ownpopulation. There had been a great outcry in this country whenpeople imagined that German prisoners of war were being fed moresumptuously than the civilian population.The Imperial War Cabinet decided that Lord Robert Cecil, with the assistance of Lord Newton and-  Sir Robert Borden, should investigate this subject and prepare a memorandum with any suggestions they mightarrive at, for submission to the Imperial War Cabinet.With.regard to Miss Vulliamy&apos;s suggestion No. 6, that a foodexpert should, be sent by the Government to Holland to look intothe entire food situation and to improve the working of the existingcontract, Lord Milner stated that the War Office had already taken up this question.The Adjutant-General said there were two propositions : First,that the existing contract with the Dutch firm should be broken ;secondly, that the Quartermaster-General should arrange to sendover bully beef and biscuits to supplement the present rations ofour prisoners. The Adjutant-General had heard that morning thatthe Quartermaster-General would be able to arrange this, provided the Secretary of State for War approved.The Imperial War Cabinet took note of the steps the WarOffice had taken in this direction, but requested The Secretary of State for War to see that a suitable man, withthe necessary experience, was sent out to Holland toendeavour to improve the working of the existing contract with the Dutch firm.With regard to Miss Vu]liamy&apos;s suggestion No. 7, that theBritish Government should make themselves directly responsible forthe development of industries in which all British prisoners of warin Holland could be employed, it was stated that the Red Cross had undertaken this work in Switzerland, and that their efforts had met with considerable success. It was suggested that Major Mitchell,who had undertaken this work, should proceed to Holland and endeavour to organise the Red Cross work in that country on thesame lines as he had organised it in Switzerland.The Imperial War Cabinet approved this suggestion, and directed -General Belfield to approach Major Mitchell, and request himto&quot; undertake this work in Holland.With regard to Miss. V.ulliamy&apos;s suggestion No. 8, that women should be sent over in greater numbers to Holland, Sir George Cavesaid that he thought it should be possible to institute a system ofleave, by which prisoners could come over to this country in larger numbers.
It was also stated that it might be possible to increase thenumber of women sent out to Holland under the auspices of theY.M.C.A. and as V.A.D.&apos;s, the present number of women going outin this capacity being very limited.On the other hand, it was pointed out that, if the agreementnow under consideration was ratified, the acute difficulty in regardto men who had long been interned in Holland would not arise, andit was suggested that, in these circumstances, it was hardly worthwhile to devote tonnage for this object. It was explained, however,,that the men from Germany, taking the places of those sent home from Holland, would still be affected.The Imperial War Cabinet directed The War Office, in consultation with the Admiralty, to endeavourto provide greater facilities for women going out to Holland.8. The attention of the Imperial War Cabinet was called to thepossibility of great discontent being caused if a preponderance ofofficers were returned to this country before the N.C.O.&apos;s and men.In this connection it was pointed out that the Dutch Govern-ment had insisted that all officers and men in Holland should be evacuated to England before a further consignment of prisoners wasreceived from Germany.Lord Newton said that, as there were now in Holland only 700officers compared to 5,300 N.C.O.&apos;s and privates, he did not think the public could imagine that the N.C.O.&apos;s and men were receivingless consideration than the officers.While accepting this view, the Imperial War Cabinet were ofopinion, however, that it would nevertheless be advisable to givepublicity to the demands of the Dutch Government in this respect,and they directed Lord Newton to take the necessary action at an opportune moment.Channels ofCommunicationbetween theDominions and theUnited Kingdom.9. In continuation of previous discussions (Imperial WarCabinet 26, Minute 8, and Imperial War Cabinet 27, Minute 8), theImperial War Cabinet considered the following three draft resolu-tions, which had been circulated by the Prime Minister as a basis for discussion : I. (L) The Prime Ministers of the Dominions, as members ofthe Imperial War Cabinet, have the right of directcommunication with the Prime Minister of theUnited Kingdom and vice versa.(2.) Such communications should be confined to questionsof Cabinet importance. The Prime Ministers them-selves are the judges of such questions.(3.) Telegraphic communications between the PrimeMinisters should, as a rule, be conducted throughthe Colonial Office machinery, but this will not exclude the adoption of more direct means of com-munication in exceptional circumstances. .II.-In order to secure continuity in the work of the imperial war Cabinet and a permanent means of consulta-tion during the war on the more important questionsof common interest, the Prime Minister of each dominion has the right to nominate a cabinet minister either as a resident or visitor in London torepresent him at meetings of the Imperial War&apos;   Cabinet to be held regularly between the plenarysessions.[530-14]c
III. These representatives of the Dominions, together withother members nominated by the Prime Minister ofthe United Kingdom, should meet as an informalCommittee to investigate the machinery for carryingon the business of the Empire after the war.Sir Robert Borden informed the Imperial War Cabinet that theDominion Prime Ministers, with the exception of Mr. Lloyd, who hadbeen out of London, had held a meeting on the previous day todiscuss these proposals, and had arrived at the following conclusions.The first proposal seemed to them only to embody what had alreadybeen practically decided upon. As regards the second proposal,they could see no reason why it should not be carried out, and wereprepared to accept it. As regards the third proposal, while fullyappreciating the necessity of consideration in advance of theImperial problem, and of informal consultation on the question,they were not prepared to agree in the desirability of setting up evenan informal Committee. The whole question was, in accordance withthe Resolution passed by last year&apos;s Imperial War Conference, tocome before a Constitutional Conference after the war. The exactcomposition and powers of that Conference, whether it would meet with plenary or more limited powers, or merely for consideration and report, was not yet settled. Before it met, the subject would,no doubt, be freely discussed in the different Parliaments and in thePress, and might most usefully form the subject-matter of informalconsultation between the Governments. But if any Committee,even the informal Committee suggested in the third proposal, were set up, the fact would inevitably become public, and the differentGovernments would continually become involved in explanations asto what that Committee was not intended to do. In the end, as oneof his colleagues had remarked, the public would begin to ask :&quot; What the devil the Committee was intended to do ? &quot;Mr. Hughes said that his views coincided, in the main, with sir Robert Bordehs. He thought there was a distinct danger-insetting up such a Committee, and felt sure it would do more harm than good.Mr. Massey said that he agreed with the first proposal, although he intended, in ordinary circumstances, to continue following thenormal procedure of communication through the Governor-Generaland the Colonial Office. As regards the second proposal, he feltcertain that the public in the United Kingdom and in theDominions, which had approved of the summoning of the imperial war Cabinet, would approve of this further step. New Zealandwould certainly greatly appreciate the privilege of being able tosend a Minister, either permanently or on a visit, to take part inthese regular Meetings of the Imperial War Cabinet, even if, at themoment, it was not in a position to make use of it. He wished to repeat what he had said on a previous occasion, that representation for this purpose must be by an actual Cabinet Minister. No HighCommissioner could represent his Government for that purpose,although conceivably the Cabinet Minister resident in London might also carry out a High Commissioners duties. As regards the thirdproposal and the question which underlay it, he wished toemphasise that, while in favour of the closest possible union, he was opposed to Imperial Federation. It was just because he was anardent Imperialist that he was so opposed, for the present, at anyrate. Imperial Federation meant &quot;an Imperial Parliament and aright to levy taxes. New Zealand, loyal as it was, would neverconsent to be taxed by a Parliament outside its own boundaries.That was the practical fact, however admirable in theory a commonParliament and common taxes might be. To attempt to enforceImperial Federation at the present time would only involve a repetition of the Boston Tea Party. Not that he was afraid of anyinfringement of Dominion autonomy involved in closer union.&quot;Autonomy,&quot; with some people, was, like &quot;Mesopotamia,&quot; a blessed
word. There was no questioning of the autonomy of the Dominions,but only a question of their right to have a share in the framing ofthe foreign policy and defence policy of the Empire. He was convinced that in this matter it was desirable to go slowly. Onerash step might postpone development for years.Genera] Smuts thought that Sir Robert Borden had stated theconclusions of the Dominions very fairly. In his opinion, the reallyimportant step was involved in the second proposal. With regardto this, the Dominions felt that the decision now taken should not beput before the public as a new departure, but rather as a matter ofcourse, a natural development of a policy which had already beenaccepted in principle. With regard to the third proposal, hethought that very useful work might be done in studying theproblem of the Imperial Constitution without the creation of aCommittee.Mr. Lloyd, while agreeing with his Dominion colleagues asregards the second and third proposals, wished to be quite clearas to the meaning of the first proposal: did it mean that, in thenormal course, correspondence between the Dominions and theUnited Kingdom Government went through the Governors-general to the Colonial Office, as in the &apos; past, and that in abnormalcircumstances it would in future go to the Prime Minister of theUnited Kingdom, either through the existing machinery of the governors-General and Colonial Office or directly ?It was generally agreed that this was so.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said he could not helpexpressing the honest regret of himself and of his colleagues in theColonial Office that these alterations had been passed so rapidly,and that more time had not been taken to consider them. He wasin some difficulty as to what the future procedure was to be, and what alternative telegraphic machinery was to be employed to that already in existence.Sir Robert Borden explained that he had occasionallytelegraphed either through the Governor-General or through theHigh Commissioner. In the latter case he had always, as a matterof courtesy, informed the Governor-General of his action.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that the effect the change would have on the position of the Governors-General andthe Colonial Secretary would depend very much on how it worked out in practice. For himself, and for the Governors-General, whoseinterests he represented as a Minister, all he could say was that he believed they could loyally accept the Cabinet decision as he did,but they and he must reserve their absolute freedom of action;so much must depend on the interpretation given to, and the usemade of, the new conditions that they and he must not be bound by the decision arrived at to-day, but must be free to take suchaction as they thought fit when they knew from experience what theresult had been.For the Governors-General he could say Avith certainty thatsome of them viewed the change with considerable perturbation.Mr. Hughes thought that things would work out without diffi-eulty in practice. After all, it was very rarely that a Prime minister was not on intimate terms with the Governor-General. His own experience had been that, so far from being hampered by theGovernor-General, he had always had the machinery of government house freely at his disposal. In communicating directly, in future,as proposed, he would naturally ask his Governor-General whether he had any objection, and, equally naturally, the Governor-general would put his cypher at his disposal.Mr. Montagu pointed out that, as the actual wording of thesecond proposal stood at present, there was no provision for the representation of India at the future meetings of the Imperial WarCabinet in the intervals between the plenary sessions. He assumed that this was not the intention, but he had no proposals to make atthe moment.   He would wish to consult the Viceroy.D
The  Prime  Minister  assented,  and  asked  him to  submit proposals later. ,The Prime Minister thought that the announcement which sir Robert Borden had made very fairly met the wishes of theBritish section of the Imperial War Cabinet. He quite understood the difficulties which the Dominion Representatives had experiencedwith regard to the third proposal. , He realised that the publicopinion of the Dominions was naturally apprehensive lest anythingshould be done at this end to impinge on their freedom and inde-pendence of action. There was, of course, no real danger of theBritish Government repeating the mistake committed with regard tothe American Colonies ; it was not often that so cardinal an errorcould be committed twice over where the punishment had been sosharp. He agreed, however, that it was not desirable to press thethird proposal, more particularly as the first two, in substance, gaveall that was necessary to cover the third. The first two would, infact, see us through the present war; and if the system thus set inoperation justified itself during the war, as, indeed, it had already done so far, it would probably also cover the period after the war.In any case, he was clear that the Dominions, which had already done so much in the common cause, had a right to a say in thesettlement of this particular dispute and of all possible futuredeputes. As regards the first proposal, he quite agreed that the direct communication there indicated was not to be the normalregular machinery. On the other hand,, if, for instance, a DominionMinister wished to communicate, with the British Government onsuch matters as had formed the subject of,Sir; Robert Borden&apos;sopening remarks at the present session of the Imperial War Cabinet,he thought that was clearly a case for direct communication to thePrime Minister.The Secretary of State for the Colonies agreed., The Prime Minister added, that, with regard to the second pro-posal, he entirely shared .the view, expressed by Mr. Massey, that only a Cabinet Minister m touch with his; own Government wouldbe a suitable representative at meetings of the Imperial War Cabinet.Sir Robert Borden and Mr. Hughes remarked that this wrentwithout saying. ........ Subject to&apos; the representation of India under Resolution II being settled between the Prime Minister, the Secretary of State for India,and the Viceroy, the Imperial War Cabinet accepted the followingresolutions submitted by the Prime Minister of the UnitedKingdom: I. (1.) The Prime Ministers, of the Dominions, as members ofthe Imperial War Cabinet, have the right of directcommunication, with , the  Prime Minister  of  theUnited Kingdom, and vice versa.(2.) Such communications should be confined to questions-   of Cabinetirnpprtance.   The Prime Ministers them-selves are the judges,of such questions.(3.) Telegraphic   communications; between  the   PrimeMinisters should, as a rule, be conducted throughthe; Colonial Office  machinery, but this will not exclude the ,.adoption  of, more direct means ofj communication in exceptional circumstances.II.-In order to secure; continuity in the work of the imperial war Cabinet and a, permanent means of consul-tation during the. war on the- more important questions of common interest, the Prime Minister oof, each , Dominion has the right to nominate aCabinet Minister either as a resident or visitor inLondon to represent him at. meetings of theImperial War Cabinet to be held regularly betweenthe plenary Sessions.
Allied intervention in Russia.Future Business.11. The Imperial War Cabinet decided that The Committee of Prime Ministers should meet on Wednesdaymorning, July 31, at 11-30, to consider the Report of theChief of the Imperial General Staff on Future Policy.2, Whitehall Gardens, 8.W.,July 30, 1918.o10. A short discussion on this subject was raised by Mr.Hughes, who pointed out the extreme difficulty of the situation, asshown, on the one hand, by Mr. Lockhart&apos;s messages urging that intervention, if not carried out at once, would be too late, and, onthe other, by President Wilson&apos;s delays.
