We had brought down altogether 36 enemy aeroplanes and 1 kite balloon, and had lost 4 ourselves.On the Italian front we had brought down 32 enemy aeroplanessince the Austrian attack started, both in France and in Italy ouraeroplanes had also done very effective work against ground targets.3- The Chief of the Imperial General Staff then gave a generalsurvey of the whole strategy of the war.
