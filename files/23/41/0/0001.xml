The Western Front.1. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that theGerman front of attack had now been extended from a width of20 miles to one of about 30 miles, by the inclusion of the salientopposite Noyon, which the French had now abandoned. TheGermans were now within 6 or 7 miles of Compiegne ; 15 divisions had been identified so far. on the front &quot;between Montdidier and theOise, and there might be 20 to 25 divisions engaged in the attackaltogether. Of these divisions,. 3 came from Prince Rupprecht&apos;s army. This left. Prince Rupprecht still with 52 divisions in line and 44&quot;in reserve, and, witli^tne excellence of the German railway system, that reserve, cor^d be thrown in in almost any direction.The most critical sector, from our point of view, was that in front of Doullens.American divisions in France.2. With regard to the American divisions in France, the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff stated that 7 of these were nowactually in the line, and 5 more, which had been undergoingtraining with our cadres, were now on their way down to Alsace.A further 5, not yet quite complete, had taken their place fortraining purposes behind the British front, and we were preparedto train another 4 as well. They were fine, intelligent troops, andwould make good soldiers.ZeebruggeBombarded.Review of theSituation.3. The Deputy First Sea Lord stated that two of our monitorshad been shelling the entrance to Zeebrugge, at 27,000 yards range.Seven enemy destroyers were observed in the Bruges Canal betweenBruges, and Zeebrugge.4. The Prime Minister reviewed the course of the war since thelast meeting of the Imperial War Cabinet in May 1917. Heindicated the part which the collapse of Russia, the unforeseendelays in the development of America&apos;s military resources, the exhaustion of our own army by its efforts in 1917, and theadvantages enjoyed by the enemy in the shape of a single command,had contributed towards bringing about the present situation on theWestern front, which, in his opinion, wrould continue critical for another two months. As against this was to be set the comparativefailure of the submarine campaign, the British progress in the East,and the increasing evidence of internal breakdown in Austria-Hungary, Turkey, and Bulgaria all of which, he pointed out, wereelements of ultimate success which would increasingly tell in our favour after the immediate crisis had been met.A short discussion followed with regard to subsequentarrangements, and it was decided to continue the discussion on thePrime Ministers statement on Thursday, the 13th June, whichwould also enable Sir Robert Borden and the other dominion prime Ministers to review the effort of their own Dominions duringthe past year. It was agreed that the statements on foreign,military, and naval policy should be postponed until the following week, to enable Mr. Hughes and Mr. Cook to be present.The text of the Prime Ministers statement will be circulated asa separate document.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,June 11, 1918.
