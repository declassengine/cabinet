Western Front. 1. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that the totalnumber of German divisions identified in the present offensive hadbeen reduced, on fuller information, to 27, of which 7 belonged toPrince Rupprecht&apos;s reserves, 13 to the Crown Prince&apos;s reserves,whilst 7 had been in the line before the offensive. All of those lastmentioned were west of Rheims, and none had been identified east ofit. As the divisions in line east of Rheims were mostly inferiordivisions, the fact of-their not having been identified might, as far asit went, indicate that a serious attack by specially trained fresh reserve divisions had been contemplated. It was at any rate possible thatthe French claim to have disorganised a heavy German attack in theChampagne by putting down their barrage just before the Germans,might be correct, and, if so, the attack might conceivably have included a great many more divisions than had been identified. Onthe other hand, it was also quite possible that the Rupprecht divisionsidentified in this offensive represented no addition to the crown prince&apos;s army, but were the result of some previous exchange offrom 6-10 divisions done for the purpose of deceiving us. TheGerman idea would presumably be to draw as many of the allied divisions south as possible by this feint on a very large scale, andthen to attack in the north, keeping Amiens under very heavy firein order to interfere with the bringing back of the troops. british general Headquarters had, on the previous day, been inclined tothink that a German attack by 16 to 18 divisions on the Kemmelfront was imminent in three or four days&apos; time. On the whole,he was inclined to think that the present attack was notthe big attack, and that the big attack would be coming elsewhere.Meanwhile, information had just come in that General Foch had started a counter-attack that morning against the Germans on a front of from 35 to 40 kilometres between Torcy and Nouvron, i.e., againstthe western face of the salient between Soissons and Chateau-Thierry.Subsequent information came in during the course of the meeting to the effect that the counter-attack had made progress to a depth of 1^- to 2 miles, and that one division had taken over 700 prisoners.With regard to the British troops, the. Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff mentioned that&quot; of the four divisions which general foch had originally intended to send to the extreme right flank of hisline in the Champagne, the two leading ones had been detrained atArcis-sur-Aube and were moving up to the line Chalons-Epernay,while the other two had been stopped further back and were detrainedon the line Clermont-Senlis. These last as they were still on theright side of Paris, could be run back to the British front in twenty-four to forty-five hours&apos; time, provided trains were available.Submarine Losses. 2. - The Deputy First  Sea Lord reported that a convoy of32,000 American troops had reached Liverpool on the previous night.The steamship &quot; Carpathia,&quot; 13,600 tons, had been attacked by a submarine and sunk about 166 miles from the Scilly Islands.There had been no casualties.Athens had reported that a Spanish steamer, having aboardM. Lopez de Vega, the Spanish Minister to Greece, had beensubmarined and sunk although flying the diplomatic flag andalthough the German Government had been previously informed ofhis sailing.The special service vessels steamships &quot; Bailey &quot; and &quot; Antic,&quot;claimed to have sunk an enemy submarine north-east of KinnairdHead on the evening of the 14th July.The Air Situation.  ^      3. The Chief of the Royal Air Staff reported that the weather in France had not been very favourable for aviation; thirty-five
3IWG 25enemy machines had been brought down as well as fifteen kiteballoons an exceptionally high proportion of the latter. Theindependent force had carried out a series of short raids.In Italy we had brought down thirty enemy machines, to aless of three of our own.AmericanAviation.4. In answer to a question about American aviation, the Chiefof the Royal Air Staff stated that there were no complete Americansquadrons in action yet. Meanwhile, the personnel of foursquadrons had been working with our squadrons. Two of these had just been formed into squadrons and equipped by us, and two more were to be equipped shortly.Desirability of undertaking an offensive in the balkans.[530-11]5. Lord Robert Cecil reported the result of a Conference ofAllied Diplomatic and Military Representatives held on Thursday,the 11th July, at Versailles, in accordance with Resolution No. 5 ofthe 7th Session of the Supreme War Council (Paper No. I.C.-72),which he had been deputed to attend on behalf of the Imperial WarCabinet. He stated that he had gone with Lord Derby to see general Sackville-West, the British Military Representative inVersailles, who informed him that, in spite of repeated applications, hehad not been able to ascertain any information about the Frenchplans for the proposed offensive. He then expressed to GeneralSackville-WTest the view that there were only two methods of gettingBulgaria out of the war : one was to convince King Ferdinand thathis interest lay in abandoning the Central Powers ; the other was topromote a revolution in Bulgaria with the object of bringing into power a, more friendly Government. In either case he considered,and was supported in this view by the Prime Minister and theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, that unless the offensive pro-duced a really serious military result, it could not have any political consequences. He had drawn attention to the fact that if the greeks and Serbs took a leading part in the proposed offensive, it wouldprobably tend to rouse Bulgarian national feeling. An attack, might also have the effect of causing Bulgaria and Turkey between whom there was considerable tension at the present moment, both in con-nection with the disposal of northern Dobrudja and over the frontier of Thrace to compose their differences. He was strongly of theopinion that to make any offer to Bulgaria at the moment would bea serious blunder, and would only lead Bulgaria to think that theAllies were in a bad way. At the same time, he had made it plain that while realising the political objections to an offensive unless sure of success, the British Government were not irreconcilably opposedto an offensive as such, and only wished to be more fully informed.In the afternoon the actual Conference took place. It waspresided over by M. Pichbn, and was attended by the italian ambassador and by Mr. Frazier (who held a watching brief for theUnited States), the Military Representatives, and a considerablenumber of other people, which made the discussion of secret ma/ttersundesirable. After Lord R. Cecil had impressed on the Conference theviews already conveyed to General Sackville-West, General Guillaumatexpounded his plan for an offensive which he was in favour of, both because he believed the Bulgarian moral to be seriously affected,and because he thought it desirable to keep up the moral of theSerbs and Greeks. He did not, however, propose that the offensiveshould take place till October a complete change of attitude fromthat which he had previously adopted.M. Pichon, in his speech, did not dissent from the generalproposition that the proposed offensive would only be of politicalvalue if it were a serious one, but he deprecated any idea of nego-tiations with the Bulgarians until they were thoroughly beaten, and&apos; B 2
was particularly indignant with the suggestion, which he attributed to the British Government that Constantinople, should be offered toKing Ferdinand.To Lord Robert Cecil&apos;s suggestion that the natural indignationof the Allies against King Ferdinand should not be allowed to goto the length of refusing.to consider possible offers from Bulgaria ifthey were satisfied that there was something genuine behind them,the Italian Ambassador had agreed whole-heartedly, and M. Pichonwith considerable reluctance.The Conference subsequently passed the following resolution : &quot; Resolution.&quot; The Diplomatic and Military Representatives&apos; meeting at versailles on the 11th July, 1918, in accordance with thedecision of the Supreme War Council, 4th July, 1918, reachedthe following agreement: &quot; From the Political Point of View:&quot; 1. That it is advisable to study the question of a generaloffensive in the Balkans with a view to the effect that may result from it on the Bulgarian situation.&quot;That it is not desirable to carry out this offensive unless it leads to a victory of more than local importance.&quot; From the Military Point of View :&quot; That it is advisable to request the Military Repre-sentatives of the Supreme War Council to examine the conditionsof a general offensive with a view to its probable results, both as to gain of ground and as to its effect on the Bulgarian army.&apos;&apos; The French Government will be requested to supply tothe Military Representatives complete information on thegeneral offensive in project, as well as on the method of execution. The question of local operations, as previouslysettled, remains unaffected by this resolution.Diplomatic Representatives :(Signed)      &quot; S. Pichon.&quot; Robert Cecil.&quot; Derby.&quot; Bonust Longare.Military Representatives :(Signed)      &quot; Belin.&quot; Tasker H. Bliss.&quot; Di Robilant.&quot; C. Sackville-West.&quot;After the Conference Lord Roberl Cecil suggested to M. Pichonthe idea of an interchange of views between the Allies on allied policy in the Balkans, and when he found M. Pichon shocked bythis he watered his suggestion down to Allied Policy in Macedonia,which M. Pichon did not favour, but at any rate promised to consider.The Imperial War Cabinet approved, of Lord Robert CeciPsReport, and instructed the Secretary to inform Versaillesthat the resolution of 11th July is approved by the BritishGovernment.Publication inAmerica of total british Casualties.6. The Minister of Information laid before the Imperial WarCabinet the desirability, from the point of view of propaganda, of publishing the total British casualties in America (see Appendix).We had many enemies in America who concentrated on suggesting that we were not playing our full part in the war as compared with france; that we had only 350,000 rifles in France, and were keeping
a ^ large army in England in order to be in a strong position atthe end of the war. Nothing could dispose of this campaign soeffectually as an official publication of our casualty lists.Lord Milner stated that from the purely military point of view there was no particular objection to the publication of these lists.We already published nominal lists, and all the Germans had to dowas to add these up in order to ascertain the totals. They mightnot believe that we gave the right figures, but this would apply equally to any statement of totals which were published. In fact,the publication would give very little information to the GermanGeneral Staff and would be a disappointment to the German public.It was generally agreed that the real difficulty lay not in themilitary objections, or in any doubt as to the usefulness of publica-tion, from the point of view of propaganda in America, but in thepossible effect of the sudden official announcement of these very heavy figures of something like 3,000,000 total casualties on theBritish public. It was argued, on the one side, that the immediate effect on public opinion might be very depressing, and that a stillmore serious effect &quot;would be the strengthening it might give to thearguments of the pacifists, whose figures of casualties were not generally taken seriously. This might specially be the case if theenemy subsequently made peace offers which were thoroughlyunsatisfactory in themselves, but might on the surface appearplausible. Against this it was pointed out by Sir Robert Bordenand others that the frank publication of casualties had always had asteadying effect upon public opinion in Canada and elsewhere. TheBritish nation would feel the need for a satisfactory end of the warafter all the sacrifices which it had made. In any case the reallyimportant question, if it came to the rejection by the Government ofplausible enemy offers of peace, was the extent of the confidence felt by the public in the&apos; Government, and this would depend on thefrankness with which the Government had treated the public.It was suggested by Mr. Massey and other members that therewere many other ways of bringing out the extent of the effort andsacrifice made by the United Kingdom besides the publication of casulties. The French as a matter of fact had managed to bring home to the American public the extent of their sacrifices withoutever publishing a single figure of their casualties. The importance was more particularly pointed out of laying stress on the vital partperformed in the war by our Navy.The Prime Minister suggested that as he had to make a state-ment in Parliament at the end of the session in a few days&apos; time, he might attempt to review the extent of the efforts and sacrifices madeby the United Kingdom and by the British Empire as a whole,drawing special attention to the work of the Navy, without actuallygiving figures of casualties. If that did not have the desired effect in America, the question of publishing casualties might be consideredagain. ..The Imperial War Cabinet agreed with this suggestion.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,July 18, 1918.
APPENDIX.G.T.-4954. --Memorandum to the War Cabinet from the Minister of Information on the Subject of periodical Publication in America of Total Casualties in the British Army.I WISH to place before the War Cabinet the question of issuing a periodic list oftotal casualties in the British Army for circulation in the United States. .Information received from America lays great stress on the utterly false impressionprevailing there of the proportion of the fighting in France done by troops from theUnited Kingdom. The continual references to the performances of troops from theDominions produce on the American&apos; mind the idea that these are doing most of thefighting, and bearing most of the losses. Such an impression has a very bad effect onthe American view of Great Britain, and the situation will not &quot;improve, as big lists of american casualties begin to come in and are published.I am taking various steps to meet this difficulty, but I believe one of the most effective would be the periodic publication of our total casualties. I approached theSecretary of State for War on the subject, and he has replied that he would have noobjection to the publication of our total casualties up to a certain date, and subsequentpublications from time to time, but that he could not take such a step without theconsent of the War Cabinet I would therefore ask that the War Cabinet give the requisite authority to the Secretary of State for War and the Minister of information to make this publication by joint arrangement between themselves.BEAVERBROOK.June 25, 1918.o
