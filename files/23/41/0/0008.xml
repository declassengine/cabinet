Allied Intervention ]. THE Imperial War Cabinet considered the draft of them Siberia. proposed resolutions for submission to the Supreme War Council(see Imperial War Cabinet 21, Minute 10). Certain further minor amendments were discussed and agreed to.Mr. Hughes informed the Imperial War Cabinet that M. Kerenskyhad said to him on the previous evening that if the Allied force inter-vening in Russia were actually under Japanese Supreme Command,that would have a fatal psychological effect. The actual Commandmight no doubt be in Japanese hands, but that the Generalissimoof the American-British force should be one of the other Allies.Lord Milner added that, at a later stage in the evening, he hadinduced M. Kerensky to admit that, if the Japanese formed the greatmajority of the force, it would not be possible to refuse the ChiefCommand to them, and that this might be acceptable to Russia if thewhole force were in some sense under an Allied political mission.The Imperial War Cabinet approved the resolutions in thefollowing form : (1). The British Imperial War Cabinet, comprising the PrimeMinisters and other representatives of the Governmentsof the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand,South Africa, and Newfoundland, and representatives ofIndia and the Crown Colonies, having carefully con-sidered the military situation and prospects of the allies in all theatres of war, have come to the conclusion that immediate Allied armed assistance to Russia is impera-tively necessary for the following reasons :  (a.) To assist the Russian nation to throw off theirGerman oppressors and to prevent the unlimitedmilitary and economic exploitation of Russia byGermany in her own interests ;(b.) For the decisive military reason given by general foch in his telegram to President Wilson, i.e.,that the Germans have already called back fromRussia a number of divisions and sent them tothe Western front. Allied intervention will bethe first step in stimulating a national uprisingin Russia against German domination, which willhave an immediate effect in renewing Germananxiety in regard to the East, and compelling her to refrain from removing further troops west-ward, and perhaps to move troops back to theEast ;(c.) To-shorten the war. They are advised that, unlessthe Russian front is reconstituted, there is no reasonable probability of such a superiority overthe enemy being concentrated by the Allies aswill ensure victory on the Western front in 1919 ;(d.) To prevent the isolation of Russia from western europe. They are advised that, if action is not taken in Siberia, the existing Allied forces inNorthern Russia may have to be withdrawn,and Russia will be completely cut off from theAllies ;(e.) To deny to Germany the supplies of WesternSiberia and the important military stores atVlaclivostock, and to render these available forthe Russian population ;(f.) To bring assistance to the Czecho-Slovak forces,which have made great sacrifices to the cause forwhich we are fighting.(2.) The Imperial War Cabinet are of opinion that the inter-vention should be Allied in character, should be accom-
IWC 2224panied by pledges to the Russian people, as agreed toat tbe last Versailles Conference, and should include thefollowing :  (i.) An Allied force to operate in Siberia. Circum-stances render imperative that the force shall be considerable in number, military in character,and Allied in composition, and that, above allthings, it should operate immediately. delay would be fatal. It is recognised that, owing to* geographical and shipping conditions, japanese troops will comprise the larger portion of theforce, but its Allied character must be maintained,and it must include American and Allied units.The force should be under, a single Command,appointed by the Power that provides the largest number of troops ;(ii.) Such developments of the Allied forces inMurmansk and Archangel as the military advisers .of the Allies may recommend ;(iii.) Relief expeditions under American direction andcontrol, to supply the wants and alleviate the sufferings of the Russian peoples.being  toThe primary object of Allied actionco-operate with the Russian nation in recreating theEastern front, as a first step towards freeing Russia, the closest co-ordination must exist between the above forces and the Russian armies.(3.) In view of (i.) The. unanimous opinion of General Foch and the allied military advisers of the Supreme War Council that theimmediate despatch of a considerable Allied force toSiberia is essential for the victory of the Allied armies ;(ii.) The facts that no adequate expedition can be sent withoutJapanese : co-operation and that Japan will not under-take effective action without the encouragement  and support of the United States Government; and(iii.) The shortness of  the time available before the winterfor initiating active operations in Siberia, and the rapid*   German penetration into Russia,The Imperial War Cabinet invite the Supreme WarCouncil to appeal to President Wilson to accept thepolicy here recommended, and thus to enable it to becarried into effect before it is too late.The Imperial War Cabinet decided that The British members of the Supreme War Council should propose these resolutions fer acceptance by the supreme war Council.Air Strategy:review by theChief of the KoyalAir Staff.[530-8]2. The Chief of the Royal Air Staff gave a comprehensive review of our air strategy. After explaining the expansion of theair forces attached to the Army and Navy, he drew attention to the strategic importance of a direct air offensive aimed at the enemy&apos;ssources&quot; of munitions supply and submarine equipment, and at the dislocation of his industrial organisation generally. He pointed out;that, in this respect, the enemy&apos;s centres of production were, for-unfortunately, concentrated in certain -compact - and accessible areas4whereas our munition industries were much more widely scattered,and, therefore, less of a target to enemy raids. The extentof the.strain that was being imposed upon the enemy in attempting to defend himself, against such a strategic offensive was indicatedB 2
by the man-power and material,we had ourselves been obliged, bya few raids, to lock up in anti-aircraft home defence. To enablethe air striking force, capable of conducting such an offensive, to be created, it was necessary, in the first instance, to maintain our existing air superiority on the Army fronts and with the Navy, andthen, by increase of output and the utmost economy in the use ofthe present establishment, to create the surplus required for the striking force. To do this effectively required a careful estimateand allocation of machines and personnel to the different functions.That allocation naturally rested with the Air Ministry, and the needfor it was, in fact, one of the main justifications for the creationof a Ministry. Looking back upon the course of the war, hesuggested that it had been largely one of battering-ram tactics on both sides. The immense national productive effort on both sideshad all flowed into that effort, whose main aim seemed to beattrition. This was true of the air effort as well, in so far as it was treated as auxiliary to the armies in the field. In spite of the immense increase in the number of machines, and the greaterdiversification of their functions, he considered that the air efforthitherto had not increased in a greater ratio of effect than at thevery beginning of the war. He suggested that, consistently withmaintaining that ratio, a new strategic factor, that of strategicinterception, striking directly at the enemy&apos;s sources of productivestrength far behind the zone of his armies, might produce a profound effect on the course of the war.Expressing his own personal views with regard to the futured development of aviation,&quot; the Chief of the Royal Air Staff statedthat he believed that, in the next war, the existence of the BritishEmpire would depend primarily on its Air Force. The giantaeroplane of the present day would be superseded by the airdreadnought of the future. But even the present aeroplane, insufficient numbers, could rapidly decide the issue of war in favourof the Power which had supremacy at the start. The menace wasone which threatened the Dominions as well as the United Kingdom,and it was quite possible that the enemy of to-morrow might bemuch nearer to them than the enemy of to-day. The bearing ofthis upon the dangers involved in Germany&apos;s expansion in Asia, andin her African and Colonial ambitions, was obvious The essence of air strategy lay in surprise. He reminded the Imperial WarCabinet of what the First Sea Lord had said with regard to thedifference between the conditions of the Navy from those of theArmy, from the point of view of co-ordination of strategy in peace,due to the speed with which the Navies could move and come into action. In the case of the air, this factor of speed of movement and need for immediate readiness for action was even greater. TheAir Force of the future would have to be always on a war footing.The desirability of expanding the present Air Staff into an ImperialAir Staff was urged. There should, in fact, be an Imperial air striking Force always ready. Behind that there would have to be asecond line in reserve. To.pro vide for that, it would be necessary to foster commercially our development. From the purely commercialpoint of view the immediate demand after the war would not be verygreat, and, unless steps were taken by the Governments of the Empire,there would be a collapse of all the enormous air industry built up during the war.The Eoyal AirForce:Review of Pro-duction andOrg-organisation by theSecretary of State.3. The Secretary of State for the Royal Air Force amplified the strategical review by the Chief of the Royal Air Staff in which he expressed his entire agreement by surveying the expansion of theForce, past and prospective, with regard to the different types of machines. He drew attention to the difficulties and limitationsinvolved in the enormous preparations required for the expansion ofthe Air Force, more particularly in such matters as the provision ofsuitable training grounds, with accommodation, and the training of
IWC 22pilots. The factors of man-power, time, and training imposedtheir limits throughout. He drew &quot;the special attention of theImperial War Cabinet to the difficulty involved in any attempt atstandardisation, owing to the continual introduction of new develop-ments which rendered the newest types obsolete in- a few months.The easiest type of machine to standardise would be the trainingmachine ; yet a.type agreed upon as the best in March 1917, whichwas ready for production&apos; in November, was rendered obsolete inOctober by a new system of training instruction discovered by a young officer. The Germans were largely handicapped by the factthat they had standardised too early in this respect, and we wereto-day reaping the advantage of our policy, or want of policy, inexploring in every direction during the earlier years of the war.Our newest motor, called the &quot; A.B.C,&quot; was, weight for horse-power,greatly superior not only to the German &quot; Mercedes,&quot; but also tothe American &quot; Liberty,&quot; although the latter was a very satisfactoryengine, which would prove most useful during the next twelvemonths. He had, in fact, sent a telegram to Lord Reading, for publication, about the performance of the &quot; Li&amp;erty &quot; motor, in orderto cheer up the American public, which had been getting despondentabout its air effort. Every endeavour was being made to reducethe number of superfluous types. From 39 types last year,there were to-day only 14 types used, only 9. of which were used in France. By next year he hoped we should only be using6 types. On the other hand, new developments in the use of airwarfare inevitably led to the creation of new types.With regard to training, Sir William Weir pointed out that thetraining had wholly changed in character in the last few months.Not only was the number of hours of actual flying required beforeofficers were sent to France greatly increased, but the intensity oftraining work done during that time was increased to an even greater extent. One consequence of this, no doubt, was a certainincrease in accidents during the period of training, which was,however, far more than compensated by greater fighting efficiency and avoidance of casualties at the front. A very real difficulty inconnection with the training was the fact that the great majority ofthe senior officers of the force were, in fact, almost boys, with perhaps eighteen months&apos; or two years&apos; training behind them, andwith little of the knowledge of organisation and power of enforcingdiscipline possessed by the men in control of an organisation of thesame size in other services. Every effort, however, was being madeto tighten up the discipline.Both Sir William Weir and General Sykes paid a high tribute to the part played by Canada and the other Dominions, both in theproduction of aircraft and in the efficiency of their personnel. -Considerable discussion followed on various points raised bythe two surveys.   . inong the points specially discussed was the &apos;need for Allied agreement as to the air strategy to be followed.In this connection the Chief of the Royal Air Staff admitted that the Air Strategy Committee at Versailles had only met twice,and had not been able to make progress owing to the refusal of theFrench to consider the question of an air offensive into the heart ofGermany as a matter which should be specially prepared and organised for.  -Another question, raised by the Minister of Munitions, was thedesirability of securing a larger force of machines actually in thefield relative to the total present output.Mr. Hughes urged that the statements which the Imperial WarCabinet had heard really raised the question of the whole policy ofthe Government with regard to man-power. A steady continuance^-for two years of the losses of the last few months would leave theEmpire crippled, whether the war were won or lost. It was essential that, at the Peace Conference and afterwards, we shouldnot be exhausted and in a position that our policy should be dictated
to us by the United States or anyone else. It was, therefore, of thefirst importance to consider how far it was possible to conserve man-power by concentration on scientific developments, such asaviation.It was suggested that, in so far as large masses of infantry were still required, the United States, with their untouched population,ought to provide them, and that we should concentrate upon morescientific development.The Minister of Munitions noted/as an instance, that we wereproducing large numbers of tanks, which we were giving to the americans, while we were putting our own men into the trenches.The Prime Minister pointed out, on the other hand, that theGermans considered that we gave too much attention to theimprovement of our appliances, and themselves concentrated muchmore on perfecting their training. There was no doubt that it wasthe high efficiency of the German army, from the point of view oftraining, and not their equipment&apos;, that had been responsible fortheir recent successes and relatively small losses which, on some ofthese occasions, they had incurred. The German machine-gun, forinstance, was the same with which they had entered the war in 1914,and much inferior to ours. It was their tremendous specialisationin the training of men to use the machine-gun that had been the secret of their success.The Imperial War Cabinet considered that the whole questionof the proper direction in which our man-power could be most effectively and - economically applied should, in thefirst instance, be considered by the Committee of Prime, ,   Ministers.[Owing to its secrecy, the text of Sir William Weir&apos;s andGeneral Sykes&apos; statements will not be circulated, but a copy is on record in the personal custody of the Secretary of the War Cabinet,and can be read at the War Cabinet Offices on application to theSecretary.]2, Whitehall Gardens, 8.W.,June 29, 1918.o
