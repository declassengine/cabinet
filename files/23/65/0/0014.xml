The Home Secretary was informed that the omission fromthe draft of the King&apos;s Speech of a reference to the Children&apos;bill was due to the fact that that Bill wcftld not be ready for some time, but that this circumstance would not preclude the introduction of the Bill at a later stage of the Session.The Secretary of State for Scotland Has assured thatthe expression in the paragraph dealing with agricultural policy &quot;Agricultural land in need of re-conditioning&quot;covered land reclamation.Subject to the amendments indicated above the cabinet approved the ICing!s Speech, a final draft, in the form soapproved is attached in Appendix II.(vi) Thirteenth paragraph dealing with town planning to he amended by the insertion before the word&quot;preservation&quot; in line 2 of the words &quot;to the&quot;.(vii) Fourteenth paragraph dealing, with Electoral Reform.The Cabinet agreed the wealing of this paragraphvidelicet &quot;A Measure of Electoral Reform will besubmitted to you&quot; and directed that the bracketsat the beginning and end of that paragraph should accordingly be deleted.(viii) Last paragraph:    The paragraph to read &quot;I praythat, under the blessing of God? the outcome of your deliberations may advance the happinessand well-being of My people&quot;.

3. The Cabinet had before^them a Memorandum bythe Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury(CP.-357 (30)),  circulated by direction of thePrime Minister,  containing the draft programme ofParliamentary business for.the period October  8 -December 19 .The Prime Minister informed his colleagues that the Parliamentary Secretary to the treasury had made representations to him in regard to thedecision of the Cabinet to take all the time ofPrivate Members up to Christmas,   He was willing totake time on Wednesdays, but made a strong appealthat Fridays might be left for consideration ofPrivate Members&apos;&apos; Bills .In the course of the discussion it was pointedout that votes of censure might be moved on severalsubjects, such as Unemployment Policy, Palestine,and the Imperial Conference, which could not berefus ed.The hope was expressed that it might be possiblefor the Trades Disputes Bill to be taken in Committeeupstairs .The Cabinet agreed  That the Prime Minister should move a Resolution for taking thetime of Private Members onWednesdays up to Christmas, butnot beyond that date at thepresent time,  and he should explain to the House of commons that this step was being takenin order to enable the Governmentto concentrate in the present emergency on unemployment legisla-tion and more particularly the Agri-cultural Bill.    If the House ofCommons insisted on devoting any considerable time to votes of censure,as suggested above, It might benecessary for him at a later stage to move a second Resolution takingPrivate Members&apos; time on Fridaysalso.    The question of taking private members&apos; time after Christmas was left for consideration, if necessary,after the Christmas Recess.
^rpLOYMENT&quot;[sjranoti.previous reference:&apos;ghinst 62(?0)v oon-,lus&apos;ion 6 .)4. The Cabinet had before them the following documents in regard to Unemployment Insurance:-(i) As regards the proposed Bill,  aMemorandum by the Minister ofLabour (C.pJ-318 (30))  and aReport by the Panel of ministers on Unemployment (0 .P.-354 (30)),both of which had already been before the Cabinet:The Second Interim Report of the panel of Ministers on Unemployment(CP.-360 (30)) stating that on theacceptance by the Cabinet of their first Interim Report a further meeting had been held, to considerwhether it was desirable to initiate,in advance of a Report from the RoyalCommission to be set up, legislation to deal with reported abuses of theUnemployment Insurance Fund*    In thelight of further information supplied by the Minister of Labour the Panelwere unanimously of opinion that itwould be best to defer taking any action to remedy alleged abusespending the Report o    the RoyalCommission.   The Report also con-tained a suggested paragraph,.forinsertion in the Speech from the throne, relating to legislation toincrease the borrowing powers ofthe Unemployment Insurance Fund.(ii) The Report of a Mission sent underthe auspices of the Economic Advis oryCouncil to Germany,  on unemployment and public works in that  country(C .P.-356 ( 30)).Attention was also drawn to the following passage in a Memorandum by the Parliamentary Secretary tothe Treasury on the House of Commons Programme(0.P.-357 (30)):-&quot;It is understood that the questionof the scope of the Bill to be taken before Christmas will be consideredby the Cabinet on Wednesday,  the 32nd.In this  connection account will nodoubt be taken of the Report of thePublic Accounts Committee   publishedlast night, in which the committee recommend that appropriate legisla-tion legalising expenditure of theMinistry of Labour on various schemesoutside the present powers of theMinistry should be introduced forth-with.    It is understood that theP.A.C. Report is under considerationby the Ministry of Labour and theTreasury .&quot;
In the course of the discussion strong reasonswere adduced by members of the Panel of ministers in regard to the great technical difficulty inamending certain abuses affecting relatively small numbers of workers and which would require legisla-tion without a comprehensive investigation of thewhole question.   The Interim Reports to be furnished by the Royal Commission would reinforce the arguments against immediate action.At the end of the discussion the Minister ofLabour reported on the meeting held on the previous day between representatives of the three parties in Parliament in regard to Unemployment Insurance.The result had been that the representatives oftoeach Party were,-prepare their own Memoranda and exchange them with the other two Parties.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the recommendation ofthe Panel of Ministers that actionto remedy alleged abuses of theUnemployment Insurance -Sets shouldbe postponed pending the Report ofthe Royal Commission:(b) To amend the draft paragraph for theKing&apos;s Speech on Unemployment Insur-ance.    The paragraph as approvedis contained in the copy of theKing&apos;s Speecjh attached as appendix II to these Minutes:(o) That the Minister of Labour shouldcontinue the policy of investigating the alleged abuses that appear inthe Press, and should take allpossible steps to make public the true facts in regard to the manyallegations that are not substan-tiated.    In particular, an allegation-tion in a recent issue of the&quot;Manchester Guardian&quot;, relatingto a soldier pensioner, was broughtto the Minister&apos;s notice for investi-gation:(d) As regards the passage in theMemorandum by the parliamentary secretary to the Treasury (CP.-357 (30)), ejuoted above, that theMinister of Labour should be
authorised to state that thematter would be dealt with inthe Bill relating to the transitional period which willbe introduced after Christmas:Unemployment (e) That the Prime Minister shouldInsurance in take steps to ascertain if the germany. Economic Advisory Council willconsent to the publication ofthe Report of the Mission onUnemployment Insurance andPublic Works in Germany (C.P.-358 (30)) and should have authority, with their assent,to publish the Report .-7-

The&apos; PrGBid.cn t of the Board of Trade informed his colleagues that the Committee of the ImperialConference on Economic Co-operation, of which hewas Chairman, had reached a point at which it wasnecessary for him to ask for decisions by the Cabineton the following five points(i)  In regard to the Canadian PrimeMinister&apos;s proposals, are the Cabinetprepared to adlow the President tomake a statement reaffirming theintention of his Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United Kingdom to adhere totheir fiscal policy, but agreeing to analyse and review the CanadianPrime Minister&apos;s proposal during thenext six months?This was an expedient, thePresident of the Board of Tradeexplained,  for easing the situation for the. Prime Minister of Canada,-and it was suggested that a special conference should, be held at Ottawain six months&apos;   time.(ii)  Could he be allowed to make some statement In which, while maintaining the fiscal policy of the Government,it could be made clear that inpractice the tariffs on whichexisting preferences are givenwould not be removed for somefixed period?&apos;. The President explained that theDominions said that the value ofthese preferences to the Dominionswas greatly diminished by the fact thatthey were liable to be removed at a mount&apos;s notice..      If,  for revenuepurposes,  the duties would have tobe.retained, he suggested that wc*might make a virtue of necessityby making some such announcement.(iii)  Could he be permitted to announce the adoption of a policy of aWheat Quota for Dominion wheat,which could, be effected withoutprejudice to  che question of a- -    wheat ^quota. for home produce?No question of guaranteed price. was. involved.(iv) As regards Import Boards and bulk purchase,   organisation of the channels of trade and an extensionof the work of the Empire MarketingBoard,  coulc. he agree to the principle-o-
of a detailed examination of these methods,  involving considerationof the various commodities articleby article, and in full consulta-tion with the particular trades concerned?    This Inquiry to beundertaken after the close of theImperial Conference,  and by the suggested permanent machinery.(v)  Could he agree to the elaboration of inter-Imperial machinery forpursuing the above inquirieson the linos of his recentMemorandum,  (CP. 313 (30)).The President of the Board of Trade said that he had always made clear that the Government remaineduncommitted on the question of principle.    It waspointed out, however,  that the question had first been brought up as a subject for discussion by theBritish Delegation,  and the other Delegationsregarded it as a British proposal.The course of events which had led up to thepresent position was described by the Ministers whoare Delegates at the Imperial Conference.The above proposals were criticised from thepoint of view both of merits and of procedureIt was agreed that these proposals opened upvery large questions of policy which could only bedecided in the light of fuller information as totheir scope and intention.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To hold a Special Meeting on tuesday,  OCTOBER 28,  in thePRIME MINISTElP^ROOM, HOUSEOP COMMONS ,  at 8 &quot;p . m. ,  forfurther examination of theseques tions;(b) That in the meantime the Presidentof the Board of Trade,  in his committee, should adopt a strictlynon-committal attitude in regardto the policy, and should invitethe Committee to explore further the question of inter-Imperialmachinery.

aor; 1  The King&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament., October 28, 1930.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons :IT has given Me much pleasure to receive My Ministers from the Dominionsand the Representatives of India who are attending the Imperial Conference. Iwatch with deep interest the progress of their labours, the satisfactory result ofwhich I shairconfidently await.I hope soon to welcome the Representatives of the Princes and Peoples of Indiawho are about to join with members of all Parties in both Houses of Parliament toconsider the future  onstitutional position of India. jMy intention is to inaugurate this Conference, and I earnestly trust that in theconclusion of its proceedings may be found agreed and wise solutions of thoseimportant questions upon which it will be called to deliberate.My relations with Foreign Powers continue to be friendly.I was very glad to entrust My Son, the Duke of Gloucester, with the duty of representing Me at the coronation of the Emperor of Ethiopia.My Government took an active part in the proceedings of the Assembly of theLeague of Nations in September last. General agreement was reached upon theTreaty of Financial Assistance to States Victims of Aggression which was recentlysigned at Geneva. The application of this Treaty is conditional upon the coming intoforce of a General Disarmament Convention, which I trust will shortly be concluded.Members of the House of Commons :Estimates for the Public Service will be laid before you.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons :I follow with grave concern and sympathy the continuance of heavy unemploy-ment among so many of My People.Economic depression unfortunately continues to dominate the markets of theworld and the accompanying restriction of international trade is felt with particularseverity in those industries which are especially dependent on export.My Government will persist in its efforts to develop and extend home, imperial and foreign trade and to help in measures which will lead to greater efficiency in industry.Proposals will be laid before you for the promotion of increased settlement andemployment on the land, and of large-scale farming operations, and for theacquisition and improvement of agricultural land in need of re-conditioning; and forthe organisation of producers for marketing purposes.I propose immediately to set up a Commission to enquire into the whole questionof Unemployment Insurance and in particular into the allegations of abuse of its provisions. The Commission will be asked to present interim Reports on the most pressing questions and, if required, legislation based upon them will be introduced.In the meantime a measure to make further financial provision for theUnemployment Fund will be laid before you.
economy Ministers propose to introduce legislation to secure for the community ^share in the site value of land.. Measures will,be submitted, to you for raising the Age of Compulsory school attendance; for -amending the law relating -&apos; to&quot; Trade&apos;&apos;- Disputes * aitd Trade Uniomand for the setting up of a Consumers&apos; Council.My Ministers propose to introduce legislation for the modification and extensiof the Law relating to town planning and to the preservation of rural amenities and for the amendment and consolidation of the Factory Acts.A Measure of Electoral Reform will be submitted to you.Bills will also be laid before you to enable the ratification of the WashingHours Convention and of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at S&amp;and for the establishment of a new statutory authority to deal with passenger tralin London. - .    ^I pray that, under the blessing of God, the outcome of your deliberations na-advance the happiness and well-being of My people.
