RUSSIA.Soviet -Pro-pagan da .(Pr previous reference:Cabinet 28(SO), Con-elusion 1.)1, Tbe Cabinet bad before thetn the Report ofCabinet Committee (CP.-349 (30)) which had metunder the Chairmanship of the Lord Chancellor tooonsider alleged propaganda activities of theThird International and the Soviet Government.The Conclusions of the Committee were summed upin the last paragraph as  follows:-&quot;We are therefore of opinionthat the Soviet Government hasnot fulfilled the terms  of itsobligation.    There is perhaps in this nothing surprising    sincepropaganda of this nature ts tothem a vital part of their pro-claimed doctrines and intentions.We do not recommend that thesubject matter revealed by ourinvestigations should now leadHis Majesty&apos;s Government t*oonsider the advisability of a diplomatic rupture.We do, however, think thata point has been reached when aremonstrance should be addressedto the Soviet Government by theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs,&quot;The Cabinet agreed -(a) To accept the Report of the CabinetCommittee (CP.-349 (30)):(Id) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should immediatelymake representations to theSoviet Ambassador.(c) That the Secretary or State forForeign Affairs should announce the decision of the Governmentin appropriate terms in reply tothe Question in Parliament that had been addressed to him for thefollowing day4 but that he 3houldnot    if pressed, agree to make public the terms of the Report.
jMPBRIAL -CON- 2. The Cabinet had before them the followingFERENOE,   1930, .. .  documents relating to the proposals under con-economic policy. sideration on the Economic side of the ImperialConference:-(previous reference: A Note by the President of theCabinet 63 Board of Trade (CP.-358 (30))(30), Con- circulating an outline of a planelusion 5.) for the introduction of a guaranteed quota for Dominionwheat on billing in the UnitedKingdom,, which had been iisedas the basis of discussion bythe Committee of the ImperialConference on Economic Co-opera-tion, together with a Report bya Statistical Sub-Committeeon wheat and flour imports intothe United Kingdom from theEmpire overseas:A Memorandum by the President ofthe Board of Trade (CP.-364 (30)circulating statistics bearing on the question of the proposedquota for Dominion wheat:A Memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs(CP ,-366 (30)) pointing, out theserious effects of a failure to resolve the crisis on the Economicside of the Imperial Conference:urging the adoption of a quota system for Empire wheat as analternative proposal to the tariffs asked for by certainDominions;    advocating that anend should be put to the existinguncertainty as to the continuanceof preferences which we at presentaccord to a limited number of commodities produced within theEmpire by a declaration that thesepreferences would be continued forthe next few years;    recommending,subject to the Reports of the Sub-Committees of the Economic Co-operation Committee, that we should undertake to make a detailed exam-ination as a preliminary to the summoning of a further conference i at  Ottawa next year into thequestion of what means, other thanpreferential tariffs,  can be found,to secure a larger share in theUnited Kingdom market for Dominionproducers of commodities in respectof which the Dominions have askedfor a tariff;    urging agreement toa declaration that we shall beprepared to examine very carefullyany suggestions which the Dominionsmay wish to make in respect of areadjustment, within existing limits,of the preferences accorded by us
to Dominion products;    and invitingconsideration to a proposal  for an&quot;Imperialisation&quot; of the empire marketing Board,  including theconstitution of a Trust Fund,with a fixed contribution to it for a term of years.    This latterproposal, it was suggested, wouldnot only be very welcome to theDominions, but would go far towardsproviding the sort of permanentinter-Imperial Economic machinery which the Government had in mind.It was suggested that the fund should be made available for expenditure not only  in the UnitedKingdom but in the Dominions, andthat one at least, if not more,of the Dominions might be preparedto make a contribution to such a trust Fund.    In this event theSecretary of State suggested thatan attempt should be made to getsome prominent figure in the life of the Empire to act as Chairmanof the body administering it.The discussion, which had begun at 5-4-5 p.m.,was adjourned at 6-45 until 8 p.m., and continued until 10-15 p*&apos;m.The Cabinet felt that the question of a wheat quota required more study than could possibly be devoted to it in the short time available before,the end of the Imperial Conference, not only on th.emerits of a Dominion quota but also in its bearing on the question of a quota for home-grown wheat,and in its political aspects generally.The Cabinet agreed  WHEAT QUOTA.(a) That the President of the Boardof Trade should maintain hisstrictly non-committal attitudetowards the principle of theDominion quota for wheat,. and should endeavour to obtain from the Com-mittee on Economic Co-operation a..Report which should present allthe arguments both for and againstthe Wheat Quota:   This report shouldhe circulated to the Cabinet.(b) That when the above Report oomesbefore the Committee of PrimeMinisters and Heads of Delegationsat the Imperial Conference, therepresentatives of the UnitedKingdom should preserve a non-committal attitude on the principleof the proposal and should direct
their efforts to secure that thequestion is remitted for examina-tion by such inter-Imperialmachinery as may be created forthe study of economic questionsbefore the next Imperial Conference:(c) That the Report on the Wheat Quotamight with advantage be remittedfor examination in detail by asmall technical and independent committee, which should report onall aspects of the scheme as affectingthe United Kingdom as a businessproposition.IMPORT BOARDS,  BULK PURCHASE,AND OTHER METHODS EOR STIMU-LATING INTER-IMPERIAL TRADE.(d) That the reference of the questionof Wheat Quota for investigation bythe proposed inter-Imperial machineryreferred to above in Conclusion (b)should,  if the other members of theImperial Conference agree, form partof a wider Inquiry into various means,other than preferential to.riffs, for increasing inter-Imperial trade,including such matters as ImportBoards;    Bulk Purchase;    the study,in concert with representatives ofindustry, of the articles in whichthe Dominions give preferences, witha view to their better utilisationor possible modification.EXISTING UNITED KINGDOM PREPERENCES.(e) That an announcement should be madeat some appropriate opportunity tothe following effect:-&quot;That there is no intention to abolish the existing duties and Empire preferences on tobacco,wines and spirits:That no such undertaking couldbe given as regards the McKennaDuties and Safeguarding Duties:That there is no likelihood that the existing duties, withtheir Imperial preferences,  on certain foodstuffs ( esa^sed dr^edfruits, sugar,  etc.,) will beremoved during the next two or possibly three years.&quot;
The Chancellor of the exchequer was asked to give careful con-sideration to the views expressed at the Cabinet Meeting on thequestion of whether the reason(namely,  the financial situation)should he mentioned or not in thestatement, and as to whether hecould see his way to agree to an intimation that the last-namedduties were not likely to heremoved during three instead of only two years,  and to discussthe matter with the Prime Minister:(f) That the United Kingdom represent-atives at the Meeting of PrimeMinisters and Heads of Delegationsshould^, ia-g&amp;tu^s-f or the-ab-enreaofleoaciono^. endeavour to secure from the representatives of theDominions any advantages forBritish trade that might be found possible,  and,  in particular, aatundertaking that they would not increase their tariffs against british goods*while the abuvo%rre-*ma^&amp;ta-i^)-ed .-i-n-t-heKingdom:INTER-IMPERIAL MACHINERY.(g) That the form of the proposed inter-Imperial machinery referredto above for the study before thenext Imperial Conference of Empireeconomic questions should be leftto the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs and the Presidentof the Board of Trade:THE EMPIRE MARKETING- BOARD.(h) That,  in any development of theEmpire Marketing Board, no addi-tional charges beyond the amounthitherto contemplated should be incurred by the United kingdom excequer,  and that advantage should be taken of the discussions on this point to carry out thedesire of the Cabinet for thecreation of the economic machineryalready referred to for the continuous study of means otherthan tariffs for the improvementof inter-Imperial trade.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I.October 28th,  1930.
