IMPERIAL X.   ^ne Cabinet had. before them a Memorandum        0-CO-^ERSECS,-I93O. by the Attorney-General (CP. p11  (JO)) preparedReport of the      in accordance with the Conclusion of the CabinetConference onthe Operation     referred to in the margin, as to what portions of dominion legislation.        of the Report of the Conference on the Operation ofPortions of Dominion Legislation should be implemented at once,the Report tobe implemented   In this Memorandum it was pointed out that the at once.recommendations of that Conference were designed to(Previous remove certain legal anachronisms which were not reference:Cabinet 51 consistent with the general principle of equality of(30), Con-elusion 1(b).) status.     After suggesting that the recommendationsunder the headings &quot;Disallowance and Reservation&quot; and&quot;Extra Territorial Legislation&quot; might well be carriedout,  the Attorney-General pointed out that in regardto the Colonial Laws Validity Act, there were some points on which a change ought to be conceded, butthat at the 1929 Conference our representatives had contended, though unsuccessfully,  that certain other topics should be treated as tho exclusivereserve of the Imperial Parliament.      If at thej;Imperial Conference objections were raised by, forexample,  the Canadian Delegation, we could take theline that the whole situation ought to be further considered, and could take advantage of the opportunityto re-state the contentions of our Delegates at the1929 Conference to the effect that (i) any matters relating to the Throne (not merely the succession to the Throne),  (ii) certain matters relating to Defence,  (iii)  the law of Prize, weresubjects suitable for Imperial legislation only.We might also seek an agreement to postpone any alteration in the Merchant Shipping Law until acommon code has been settled.     At the same timethe Attorney-General felt bound t$ remind theCabinet that each of these matters was very fully discussed at the 1929 Conference,  that certain
of the Dominions showed themselves unalterablyopposed to the solutions summarised above,  andhe himself regarded it as improbable that theywould be prepared in 19 30 to accept what they had so emphatically rejected in 1929.After a short discussion with the Attorney-General, the Cabinet took note of his memorandum and commended it to the attention of the UnitedKingdom Delegates.-2-
2.    The Prime Minister informed his oolleagiiesthat he had held an informal meeting the same morning with the Prime Ministers and Heads of delegations now in London, tlxat  is to say, all except the Canadian Prime Minister.   considerable discussion had taken place in regard to the draftAddress to His Majesty The King, which containedat the end the words &quot;united in allegiance to theCrown&quot;.   Rather to the Prime Minister&apos;s surprise,Mr McGilligan, the Irish Chief Delegate, haddesired to substitute a phrase taken from thecorresponding Resolution of 1936,  namely,  &quot;underthe Crown&quot;.    The Prime Minister had pointed out.that the words &quot;allegiance to the Crown&quot; had beentaken from the formula agreed to at the ImperialConference, except that the word *common&quot; had been omitted before &quot;allegiance&quot;;    also,, that the phrase &quot;under the Crown&quot; had been used at the outset of the 1926 Conference, before the formuladefining inter-Imperial relations had been drawnup.   Mr McGilligan had met with considerable support from General Kei-tzog and Mi- Scull in.The Prime Minister and the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs did not feel much objection tothe formula o^ 1926,, and had eventually agreedto substitute the words &quot;under the Crown&quot; after a discussion which had been very useful inrevealing the general attitude of the variousDelegations .   The Prime Minister added that theprocedure proposed for the Conference had now beenagreed to.   A Plenary Meeting would take place onthe morrow at 10 a.m,, and it was hoped to conclude the Opening Speeches the same morning.
11 ill-In the afternoon it was proposed that the PrimeMinisters and Principal Delegates should meet toconsider the best manner of handling the Consti-tutional questions arising at the Conference.(NOTE: Before the departure of the Attorney-Generalhe had arranged for him to be present at that meeting.)    Also on the afternoon of the same day a start would be made with the work of theGeneral Economic Committee to be set up ,to consider economic questions, and he hoped that sir Sydney Chapman would preside, as he had donein 1926.    On Thursday,  October 2nd, the Plenary-Conference vould meet, probably in Committee ofthe whole Conference, to discuss Economic qu.es-tions.
IMPERIALCONFERENCE.19 30 .Op eningMeeting .attendance of cabinet ministers.3o   The Prime Minister told the Cabinet thathe had been informed that morning that it was notin accordance with precedent for the whole Cabinetto attend the Opening Meetings of Imperial Confer-enees, but ashed whether his colleagues wouldlike to be present at the Opening Meeting.   he explained that the number of seats at the tablewas 1 im.ited, but that those meu.hers of the cabinet who were not members of the Delegation who wishedto attend could be accommodated   with seats iim e-diately behind the Delegates.The Cabinet agreed  That those Cabinet Ministe7&quot;S who desired to be present should notify their names at  once tothe Secretary, who would makethe necessary arrangements.
IMPERIAL ..CONFERENCE,19 30 .Proposed Pub-lieation ofa Whit e P*aper .(previous reference:Cabinet 55(30), Con-clusion 4.)4.   The President of the Board of trade informed the Cabinet that the statistics prepared with the possibility of their being published asa White Paper, would be ready within one day for consideration by meiy/bers of the Cabinet.9-6-
IMPERIALconfer nof.19 30 .Singapore.(previous reference erence:Cabinet 30(30), Con-elusion 3.)5.   The Prime Minister raised the questionof how the subject of Singapore had best bediscussed at the Imperial Conference.    There were two aspects,  the political and the military.The alternatives would be to begin with a discus-sion of the military aspects at the Committee ofImperial Defence, reserving the political issues,or to begin with a discussion of the political issues only .In the course of the discussion it wassuggested that Australia and New Zealand werethe Dominions principally concerned, and that itmight be advisable to begin by a discussion withthose Dominions only, with,  perhaps, representa-tives  of India and the Malay States, which latter had made an important contribution.After some discussion the Cabinet agreed -(a) That the most  convenient procedure would be a discussion I. between theFighting Services Committee ofthe Cabinet and the Prime ministers and Heads of Delegations at. theImperial Conference:(t) That the Conclusions reached atthat discussion should be reportedfor consideration by the Cabinet:(c) That the Secretary should circulate to the Cabinet the most recentConclusions and the last Reportof the Fighting Services Committeeon the subj ect .
6.   The Secretary of State ^or ForeignAffairs informed the Cabinet of the action hehad taken at the end of the previous week atGeneva on learning of the rumoured breakdown of the Franco-Italian negotiations.    He had atonce seen M. briand, who had told him that thenegotiations were not broken off but onlysuspended.    Signor Grandi had returned to Rome,probably for the reason that the lack of progressin the conversations was likely to prove-embarrassing if he remained.    The foreign secretary had accordingly seen Signor Soiolojaand had impressed on him the importance of notcreating the impression that the negotiations were finally broken off if there were a prospectof their being continued.   At the Italian Dele-gate^ suggestion the Foreign Secretary had sent a message to the British Ambassador at Rome, and only that same morning he had learned thatM. Briand had been informed that the ItalianGove-onment regarded the negotiations as notbroken off but only suspended,  and that alldoors were open.    The Foreign Secretary hadimpressed on both parties the difficulties thatwould arise at the m.meeting of the p-eparatoryCommission, and possibly even at the disarmamentConference, if the Franco-Italian question hadnot been settled:    also the tad effect if thefigures were so high as to involve recourse to article 21 of the London Naval Treaty, 19 30.
7 .   Tlao Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs thought it was not likely that the amendments to the Covenant would Le adopted bythe Assembly in the present year.    In that event the United Kingdom Delegation would work for thequestion being passed back to the originalCommittee for further consideration in the lightof the discussions at the Assembly.
THE general act FOR TFEPEACEFULSETTLEMENT-OF INTER-NAT TONALDISPUTES.(Pr previous reference:Cabinet 31(30), Con-conclusion ion 2 ,)&apos; S. Tbe Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that at Geneva the representatives ofthe Dominions had pressed that the United KingdomDelegations attitude in regard to the general act for the Peaceful Settlement of international disputes should not be finally decided until thematter had been discussed at the Imperial Confer-ence .
RENEWAL OPARBITRATIONTREATIES.Bellig er ent&quot;Rights at sea.(previous reference:Cabinet 52(29), Con-clusion 2.)9.   The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs pointed out that the question of the renewal ofthe Arbitration Treaty with the United States ofAmerica was still outstanding, and was to someextent hound up with the question of BelligerentRights at  Se^ .    The matter would ha\e to be raised at the Imperial Conference, and the position mightbe inconvenient if it were not cleared up.   he recalled that the late Government had investigated -the question and a majority in a Committee had reached certain conclusions on the subject.    Hewas now informed that the present First Sea Lordadopted the same&apos; attitude on the question as his predecessor.The Cabinet agreed  That the question should bediscussed in the first instancebetween the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs and the FirstLord of the Admiralty, who should reach agreement,  if possible, andin any event report to the Cabinet .
INDIA. 10.   The Cabinet had. before them aMemorandum byThe North- the Secretary of State ^or India (0 .P .-321 ( 3t))&quot;&quot;est Frontier.  in regard to the North--Vest Frontier of India andyeasures for.dealing with the measures proposed by the Government of india the Afridis.   .for dealing with the Afridis,  explaining the circum-stances in which the Government of India propose tosend a force beyond the administrative border of the-Peshawar District on October 15th. to cover theconstruction of certain roads and to occupy positionsto protect those roads, and further to forbid access to the Kaiuri Plain to offending sections o^ theAfridi Tribe, stating the reasons for the proposal and the forms that criticism might take following upon this action.    Attached to the Memorandum by theSecretary of State was a Memorandum on the same subject prepared by the Political Department of the india O^ice, containing full details of the pro-posals of the Government of India and commentingthereon.The discussion on this Question revealed ageneral opinion that the subject required a detailed investigation.The Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary of State&apos;smemorandum.  (CP.  ^21   (j50,), shouldbe remitted for immediate examination by the  Defence of India Sub-Committee of the Committee of ImperialDefence, which should be asked toinclude in their Report an appreciation of what is the maximum commitmentand risk involved in the proposed operation.&apos; previous reference erence:Cabinet 54(30),  Con-conclusion ion 11.)
THE COTTONAQUATION.&apos;Vv eviousRe^er once:Cabinet 56f30),  Con-oluaion 2 .)11.    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for Home Affairs  r0.^.-3l9( 30))-reporting to his colleagues the general positionin the Cotton Industry and the action taken following the publication of the Report of the Cotton Gommitteethe Economic Advisory Council,  of which he wasChairman.    The Memorandum showed that considerable progress was Lein- made to give effect to therecommendations of the Report which related to thedevelopment of co-ope-^tive effort in the industry,but as regards the other recommendations of the Report,which dealt with a:-alga at ions and questions o^technical improvements (involving  considerationchanges in working  conditions),  progress must neces-sarily be slower,   A suggestion had been made that aconference o^ the various interests affected, shouldbe held under a neutral Chairman, but such a confer-ence seemed to the Secretary o^ State to be premature.In the meantime he was remaining in close contact with the situation and would not fail to take any opportunity that presented itself o^ assisting theindustry to surmount any difficulties that might arise.The home Secretary informed the cabinet of further conversations that were to take placeimmediately on the subject of the re-organisationof the industry.The discussion revealed some disappointmentthat greater progress had not been made, but the limited powers of the Government in this matter were explained to the Cabinet.      It was suggestedthat unless greater progress were made in thenear future by the parties concernea it might benecessary to ask Parliament to confer greater-13-
powers on the Government.The Cabinet took note of theReport on the Cotton Situation,(CP, 319 (30)), and expressedthe hope that no opportunity wouldbe lost to press forward as rapidly as possible with there-organisation of the industry.
EXPORT CP TAR        12. The Cabinet further considered a MemorandumMATT RIALS ANT)WARSHIPS. by the First Lord of the Admiralty (CP.-314 (30))owhich had been before them at the Meeting -preferred(.previous reference: to in the margin, in relation to the wider questionCabinet 55(30),  Con-       of removing obstacles f^om the export trade of thiselusion 8.)country in warships and war material, which had been reserved for consideration by the Cabinet after thereturn of the Secretary o* State ^&quot;or Foreign Affairsfrom Geneva.The First Lord of the Admiralty gave theCabinet some striking figures as to the extentof the construction of warships, for foreign government, in Italy,  the value of which wasabout ten times that of the corresponding ordersbeing carried out in this country.      This heattributed largely to the Italian policy forgiving long credits with Government guarantees.The Export Credits Scheme in this country didnot apply to the armament industry, and theresult was that many orders were being lost toforeign countries.The First Lord also read a letter whichhad been received in the -admiralty from the managing Director of one of the great armament firms, containing some statements which, ifcorrect, were very remarkable.The Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should do his utmost to ascertain the factsregarding the policy of. theItalian Government in thismatter,  including extended credits.  OThe First Lord of the Admiraltyundertook to communicate to theForeign Secretary the information in his possession.
MILITARY CON-TRIBUTIONSEY colonial governments.The Governor-ship of Bermuda(previous reference:Cabinet 54(30),   Con-clusion 9 (a) .)-j^. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Secretary of State fir &apos;-Var &apos;0.P.-315 tssp-\),furnished in accordance with the request o^ theCabinet at their Meeting referred to in the margin,giving his reasons for the appointment of governor of Bermuda being held by a Military Officer, and suggesting that there are not sufficient grounds fordisturbing an arrangement which, he believed, had worked s?tisfaetorily for two and a half centuries.The Cabinet were not impressed by thearguments in favour of the appointment as governor of a Military Officer of high rank, and agreed  That the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies and theSecretary of State for War should examine the position andreport their recommendations.
PROPOSED FIJI- 14.      The Cabinet had before them a Note byNET ZEALANDTRAD&quot; AGREE- the Secretary of State for the Colonies &apos;C.P.-MENT .320 (SO)) circulating for the information Qf his(Previous&apos; colleagues a Memorandum he had had prepared in reference:Cabinet 54 the Colonial Office outlining the history of a(JO;, Con-clusion 7).   . proposed Fiji-New Zealand Trade Agreement, which involved, inter alia,  discrimination againstAustralia.    In viev   of Preferential Tariffsbecoming a question of wide importance,  it was felt that the proposed Trade Agreement must beconsidered in the light 0&quot; these wider consideration-tions.   At the end of the Memorandum it was stated that the Secretary of State for DominionA^^airs felt that an announcement of a decisionon this question on the eve of or during theImperial Conference, without affording any opportunity to the Commonwealth Government toconsider the position, would be impolitic, andthat the President of the Board of Trade con-sidered that any policy involving discrimination between different parts of the Empire was open to objection.   The Secretary of State for the .Colonies therefore proposed to defer a finaldecision until after the Imperial Conferenceand to take the opportunity afforded by theConference to discuss the situation with therepresentatives o&apos; the Commonwealth Government.While regretting the tendency ofcertain Colonial Governments to giveexclusive preferences to particularDominions, as illustrated by this instance    Qas well as the one referred to at the
Cabinet Meeting mentioned in the margin, theCabinet saw no useful action could be taken a.)the moment, and invited the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies to report to them after his conversations with the representativesof the Commonwealth Government.O
NEXT MEETING 15.    The Cabinet agreed te meat en Thur. lay,CABINET.&apos; &apos;    October 2nd, at 5.3 p.m. , and that the onlysubjoct on the Agenda Paper should be thequestion of&quot;THE STANDARD OP LIFE, ETC.&quot;.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.both September,  1930.)

The Minister of health consulted theCabinet as to the opportunity he should take to announce the Governments policy in regard toMaternal Mortality set forth in the conclusion referred to in the margin.      If the subject wasto be included in The iCing&apos;s Speech, he would prefer to defer his announcement until the Debate.If not,  he would take an earlier opportunity,either when meeting a deputation, or, alternatively,at the annual Conference of the Labour Partyduring the following week.The Cabinet agreed  (a) In so much as the largerpolicy decided on by theCabinet could nox be put intolegislative effect during thecoming Session of Parliament,the announcement should not bemade in connection with Thehing&apos;s Speech;(b) That of the alternatives theLabour Party Conference wouldbe preferable.
