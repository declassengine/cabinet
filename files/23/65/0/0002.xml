B&apos;Irr&apos;RIAL 1 .The Cabinet bad before the..- the follow in?i - CONFERENCF,1930. documents relating to the Imperial Conference,19 30:-(PreviousA Most Secret Memorandum by theSecretary of State for DominionAffairs  (CP .-28* (30)) giving a brief outline of the Agenda of theImperial Conference and of theattitude which it is proposed thatthe United Kingdom representatives should adopt on the various qu.es-tions which arise under thedifferent heads.    This memorandum was based on the Minutes of thePolicy Committee, which had alreadybeen circulated to the Cabinet(CP.-233 (30)   and CP.-233-A (30)).The Agenda was classified underthe following three main hep dings:-I.    INTER-IMPERIAL RELATIONS.II.    FOREIGN POLICY AND Dt-PENCE.III.    ECONOMIC QUESTIONS.A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs (C.P.-299 (30)) in regard to the pro-cedure at the forthcoming ImperialConference.Reference:Cabinet 49(30), Con-clusion 2 ,)A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for India (CP.-306 (30))suggesting that the draft statute of Westminster should be amended so as to leave the United Kingdomfree to make India a dominion of the kind to which this Billapplies, whenever this course is thought right, and in themeantime, if necessary, to callher a Dominion, without in either case the assent of the otherDominions being required.A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for the Colonies    CP.-290(30)) urging that, in view of thelarge and ever-growing importance ofthe Colonies, Protectorates and mandated Territories as e con-stituent part of the Empire,  itwould give a better appearanceif the Secretary of State responsi-ble for then; sat as a full zsezitberof the United Kingdom delegation at the Conference,  that is,  &quot;for political and general questions&quot;instead of &quot;for economic questions&quot;only, as decided by the Cabinet onJuly 23rd (Cabinet 44 (30)).
The Cabinet were impressed by the difflcul-ties created by the Report of the ImperialConference of&apos; 1926,  and more particularly by the emphasis laid on equality of status between GreatBritain and the Dominions and the keeping in the background of the principle of co-operation, whichis a necessary supplement to the other.    Thatfundamental difficulty had been accentuated bythe Report of the Conference on the Operation ofDominion Legislation,  etc.,  of 1929, which wasin effect an attempt to write by lawyers a very complicated Constitution which had better never have been written at all,  or in any event agreedto by political minds.    It was recognised thatthe details of the Report of 1929 were logicallyconsistent with the results of the Conference of1926,  but,  considered as a whole,, the results were felt by the Cabinet to be highly unsa.tisfact-ory and,  it was thought, would not commend them-s elv ss to sou,e of the Dominions. k-The Cabinet felt that the complications of thepresent position were well illustrated by theIndian difficulty raised in the Memorandum by theSecretary of State for India  f CP,-306 (30)).the Statute of Westminster were drafted in itspresent form,  India would appear to be excludedfrom the status of a Dominion, which could onlycause reactions of a most unfortunate characterin India.    If, on the other hand, provision wasmade to enable India to become a Dominion, hopesmight be raised which possibly could not, at thepresent time, be satisfied.   The Cabinet recog-nised also that the discussion of the Statute o^-g-
Westminster, in its present shape, would strengthen the right of the Dominions to claim that they must be consulted before a Colony was raised to the status of a Dominion.    In this con-nection the Cabinet were reminded that the admissionof India to the Imperial Conference in 1917 hadbeen decided on only after a resolution had been moved by the Prime Minister of Canada, seconded bythe Priroe Minister of New Zealand,  and passed- bythe Imperial 1J!&apos;&quot;ar Conference, and that the resolutionhad been subject to the concurrence of the Govern-rnents concerned.    As a further fact to be remembered,it was pointed out that India was represented atthe Imperial Conference, as well as at the League ofNations and at the recent London Naval Conference,and at these occupied the same position as a Doijjinior.On the other hand, the Irish Free State had been admitted as a Dominion without consultation with theImperial Conference.   Both these events, however,it was recalled, had preceded the Conference of1926, with its important statement of the Constitu-tional position.There was general agreement in the Cabinet tnatat the forthcoming Imperial Conference it would be wise, if found acceptable to the Conference as awhole,  to proceed sovc-ewhat slowly in giving effectto the Report of the Conference on the Operationof Dominion Legislation, etc., 1929, and to concen-trate on those portions of the report which wereo^ real urgency,-   There was also general 2 agrees entthat many of the Constitutional matters to bediscussed at th7e Conference, particularly thoseaffecting the position of the Crown, were of such a1 &apos; St&quot;
delicate nature that it night te found better to discuss them in the first instance,  at any rate,as informally as possible.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the policy of the british representatives should be toproceed cautiously in implement -ing the Report of the Conferenceon the Operation of Dominion Legis-lation,  etc., 1929*    to concentratein the first instance on those recommendations of the Report whichwere of immediate urgency&apos;    and,if practicable, to reserve theothe^ portions of the Report forconsideration at a later Confer-ence, by which time further experi-ence would have been gained:    andthat other members of the confer-ence should be sounded on this:(b) That the Attorney-General,  in con-sultation with the legal represent-atives of the Departments concerned,should,  as soon as possible,  examinewhich portions of the report of theConference on the Operation ofDominion Legislation,  etc.,,  1929,ought to be implemented at once,and that, after consultation withthe Prime Minister, he should report o the Cabinet.The Cabinet recognised that theappointment of Governors-general was one of the subjects which oughtto be dealt with among the ques-tions of urgency.(c) That the Att orney-General,, in con-sultation with the legal authoritiesreferred to in (b) should also consider hew the Statute of Westminsterwould be affected by the above decisions,e,g., whether it would, require to bere-cast, possibly under another title,or whether it would merely  need to bere-draft ed:(d) That,  in view of the reasons givenin C.P.-29 0 f30) and in so much asat the last Imperial Conference theSec^eta^&apos; of State for Dominion affairs and the Colonies, who had then been one and the same person (although the officeshad already been separated) had,  in his capacity as Secretary of State for theColonies, made a statement to theConference in&apos;regard to the Colonies.Protectorates and Mandated Territories,;the present Secretary of State for theColonies should -be a full member ofthe United Kingdom Delegation at theConfer-nee as representing the Colonies.Protectorates and Mandated Territories:
( e) To approxe genera 11 y tlie procedure proposed by the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs in CP.-299(30),  including the suggestion inparagraph 6 that each United KingdomDepartment which is in any wayconcerned with the work of theConference should, nominate a singleOfficer to whom the Secretariatcould refer on matters requiring adecision at very short notice:(f) That.., in viev.  of the large numberof Delegates, Deputy Delegates and officials attendin? the Conference,the first Meeting&apos; should, subjectto the concurrence o&apos;f the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs, he heldin the large room in the ForeignOffice,    It was agreed that meetings on Economic subjects should be heldin the Board of Trade.
BULK PURCHASEOP DOMINIONPRODUCE.(Pr ev i previous reference:Cabinet 49(30), Con-elusion 2(l) .)IMPORT BOARDS.(previous reference:Cabinet 48(30), Con-elusion 1.)2.The Cabinet had before them the following documents relating to Bulk Purchase of DominionProduce and Import Boards respectively, viz.:-A Note by the Secretary (C,P.t287 (30))  circulating copies oftwo Memoranda on Bulk Purchaseof Dominion Produce (PapersI.E.C. (30) 45 and I.E.C. (30)61) prepared by the inter--Depart-mental Committee on        FconomicQuestions for the considerationof the Imperial Conference PolicyCommittee, which had been printedby authority of the above committee as briefs for the use of the UnitedKingdom Ministers at the ImperialConference:A Note by the Chancellor of theExchequer (CP.-305 (30))propounding a number of questions relating to Bulk Purchase and import Boards, to serve as afocus of the Cabinet&apos;s discus-sions on the subject:A Memorandum by the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries (C .P.-307 (30)) on the subject of ImportBoard Policy, suggesting the appoint-ment of a Board for the purchase of imported wheat and flour and ofhome-grown wheat of millablequality as part of our homeAgricultural Policy, and contain-ing proposals for achieving thisob j ect.The Cabinet began a discussion on these subjects and reached an interim conclusion that if ImportBoards were to be adopted as a policy, it must be primarily in the interests of the people of theUnited Kingdom.   This would mean that an ImportBoard should be free to purchase in any part of theworld.No decision in principle was taken, however, andthe subject was adjourned until the same afternoonat 2-30 p .m .I, Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.1,September 17, 1930.
