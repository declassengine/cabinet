LONDONNAVALTREATY.Franco-italian relations(Pr previous reference:Cabinet  38(30), Con-clusion 2.)E The Prime Minister drew the. attention ofthe Cabinet to an article in &quot;The Daily Herald&quot;in regard to relations between France and Italy,the general tenor of which was to suggest that italy was responsible ^or a breakdown.   Thisversion, the Prime Minister informed his colleagues,was quite incorrect.   As &quot;The Daily Herald&quot; was regarded on the Continent as the official organ ofthe Government, the article was unfortunate.   Hehad thought it right to give the Cabinet the facts .
ALBSTIEE. 2.    The Cabinet had before them the Reportof the Cabinet Committee set up at the meeting(previous refer erics ? - ref erred to in the margin,  on the subject of PolicyCabinet if 6(30, , Con- in Palestine,  (C.R.  p01  (J50)) .      Attached to the elusion 11) .Report of the Committee was a draft statement ofpolicy, which the Committee recommended should bepublished simultaneously with the publication of3ir John hope Simpson&apos;s Report to the Secretary ofState for the Colonies on his enquiry into Landsettlement.      Attached also to the Report was a personal and confidential letter, dated 1...,th august,1930, from Sir John Rope Simpson to the Secretaryof State for the Colonies.      The Committee mentioned that they had set up a small Expert Committee toexamine Sir John hope Simpson&apos;s settlement scheme,ana to advise as to the manner in which financial provision might best be made &quot;go give effect to thepolicy outlined in the draft scheme.The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated thathe had received an indication of a coming Report fromthe Expert Committee referred to above.      Afterconsultation with Sir John Hope-Simpson,  the expert committee had brought to light certain facts whichhe thought had not been in the minds of theCabinet Committee when they reported.      ApparentlySir John Hope-Simpson&apos;s scheme involved theexpenditure of some  6,000,000,. spread over tenyears,  the interest on which would have to be guaranteed by the Exchequer.      This would probablym necessitate a loan spread over twenty years,  theservice of which would require iSL00,000 a year.This sum, however, did not include the capital cost of the land.      Those sums were certainly much
larger than anything contemplated, by the CabinetCommittee.      In the circumstances he thought theCabinet should take no decision at the moment, butleaye the Cabinet Committee to examine the questionagain in the light of this information.The Secretary of State for the Colonies assentedto the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s proposal, butgave strong reasons for the urgency of a decision,and intimated that he himself had not contemplatedmore than a small guaranteed loan up to, perhaps, 1,000,000, for two or t.,ree years, without committing the Exchequer beyond that.      Moreover, Palestinemight be in a position to contribute substantially to the service of such a loan.Some discussion then took place as to thedesirability of the Secretary of State for the Coloniesseeing the leaders of the Zionist Organisation,communicating the general tenor of Sir John Hope-Simpson&apos;sReport, ana discussing with them the action to betaken thereon.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To postpone further considerationof the question until the CabinetCommittee had met to consider theReport of the Expert Committee.(b) To leave to the x5rime Minister andthe Secretary of State for theColonies the decision on discuss ions with
IRAQ.Policy in.Treaty with.(previous reference:Cabinet 35(30), Con-clusion 2) .3*     The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for the Colonies,(CP. 292 (j50)), covering formal Notes which hadbeen exchanged between Sir Francis Humphrys andNur-i Pasha,  the Iraq Prime Minister, dealing with various matters, including the financial conditionscovering the relinquishment by the Royal AirForce of their present stations at Hinaidi andMosul five years after entry into force of theIraq Treaty, and their establishment in newair bases in Iraq;    also with the future of theIraq railways,   and   the Port of Basra;    also onthe question of the policy of the RailwayCorporation,  to which it is proposed to entrustresponsibility for the administration and management of the Iraq railway system,  to raiseloan capital for the development of that systemwithout the assistance of a Government guarantee.It was mentioned that the Notes dealing with thefirst two subjects would be published simultaneously in this country and Iraq, so soon as Nuri Pashahad returned to Baghdad and Arabic translationshad been cade.      Provision for the conclusionof these Agreements had been included in theTreaty with Iraq signed at Baghdad on thepOth June, 1930.The Cabinet took note of the above memorandum.
THE CENSUS,1 931 .(Previous   -Reference.Cabinet 13,(19), Oon-conclusion ion 3)&apos;FA4, The Cabinet had before them a joint memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotlandand the Minister of Health, setting out thearrangements which they proposed should be embodied in the draft Order in Council underthe Census Act, 1920,  (CP. 296 (30)).      It was mentioned in the Memorandum that the programmedid not include any express enquiry onUnemployment, as the Minister of Labour, after full consideration, had decided against it,for reasons givon in the memorandum.The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to theinclusion of birthplace and nationality in theinformation to be asked for, and it was suggestedthat this information would be difficult for some people to supply and might be resented by others.It was pointed out, however, that particulars as tobirthplace were only supplementary to place of residence, and no penalty was attached to non-compliance,  although it would be as well not toadvertise that fact.The Cabinet approved the joint memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Scotland and the minister^ Health (CP .-296 (30)).
ONCiM?LOYME25T 5. The Cabinet had before them MemorandaPOLICY. -by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,;*[previous (CP.  23j5 (30))? and- tiie Lord Privy Seal,&quot;Reference:Cabinet 4.6 (CP.  293 O0))j  ori &quot;the subject of Unemployment(30), Con-elusion 16). Policy and the Problems of British Industry.The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet thathe was awaiting a further survey bearing on Unemploy-ment Policy from a Committee of the Economic AdvisoryCouncil, which he hoped would be available within afew days.   He thought the detailed discussion of theabove Memoranda should be postponed until this thirdMemorandum was available.   The Prime Minister thengave the Cabinet some particulars of his conversationon the previous day with Mr Lloyd George, which ledto a discussion of a preliminary character.    In thecourse of this discussion emphasis was laid on theimportance of speeding up the expenditure already provided for such matters as road construction, andon the possibilities of further telephone extensions,and possible re-organisation with this object.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To postpone the discussion of theabove Memoranda until the Memorandumof the Economic Advisory Council was available:(b) That the three Memoranda should thenbe considered by a Cabinet Committee,,composed as follows -The Prime Minister,The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Lord Chancellor,The Home Secretary -who would prepare for the use oftheir colleagues a synopsis of thewhole field covered by the threePapers in a form which could be used as an Agenda Paper by the Cabinet.

PROPOSEDTARIFFCONFERENCE with canada AND THEWEST INDIES,(previous reference:Cabinet 3^(30,,  Con-clusion 1 0).7, The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for the Colonies,(CP.  302 (30)), in regard to a proposed TariffConference between Canada and the West Indies,in which attention was drawn to thepolicy approved by the late Government in1925,  to the effect that, if the Coloniesconcerned felt that it would in any way makeit difficult for them to extend an increasedpreference to the Mother Country as well as to canada,  the Mother Country would not in that case insist on the preference being extendedto her.      It was pointed out that    if^as aresult of the forthcoming Conference with canada the participating Colonies actuallywished to discriminate against the mother country,  there would be great difficulties in preventing them, and it was suggested thatthe best prospect of avoiding tariffdiscrimination against the United Kingdom wouldbe to re-affirm, when the occasion arises,  thepolicy of 1925, and to trust to the good-will of the Colonies concerned.      If any alteration in that policy was decided upon, it was insisted that an announcement ought to be made before a further Conference is convened.The Secretary of State for the ColoniesImpressed on the Cabinet that he had alreadyintimated that he could not take steps to convene a Conference as proposed by the Governor ofTrinidad, but that he could not prevent the
private negotiations referred to in the last paragraph of his Memorandum, which wight precipitate-tate the issue.    It vas his intention to consult the Cabinet before reaffirming the policy of 1925.The Cabinet took note ofC.P.-302 (30) .i

The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the President of the Board of Trade,  (CP. 206 (JO,),circulating copies of his correspondence withGolonel Peel, Chairman of the Export CreditsAdvisory Committee,  resulting from the decisionof the Cabinet referred to in the margin.The Prime Minister informed his colleagues thatat the last meeting of the Economic Advisory Councilone of the members had referred to an incident of1which he had heard (for the accuracy of which hecould not vouch)  in which it was alleged that- theRussian Government had obtained long credit throughthe Exports Credit machinery for the purchase of acertain commodity, but that on the completion of the transaction they had not exported the commodityto Russia but had re-sold it in London.   The PrimeMinister had undertaken to investigate the incident,and he read to his colleagues a letter on the subjectfrom one of the Joint Secretaries t o the economic advisory Council.   While this letter was satisfae-tory to the extent that it proved the commodities to have been put on board ship in London, there wasone point which he thought would require further investigation^ namely, as to whether material whichhad. actually been shipped in London had really been landed in Russia and not sold at some intermediateport in order to build up credits.The Cabinet took note of C.P.-S86 (30).

The death withinthe last few days of the late Governor appeared to of^er an opportunity to re-examine this question.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretary of State for :&apos;rarshould furnish the Cabinet with aMemorandum on the subject of why amilitary Officer should be appointed as Governor of Bermuda:(b) To take note of CP.-295 (30).

As the cost of thescheme might be within the range of one toone and a half million per annum, the Ministersubmitted an alternative scheme of a lessspectacular nature and politically lessattractive.In the absence of the Minister of health the Cabinet postponed, consideration 0* his Memo-rand urn until their next Meeting .
