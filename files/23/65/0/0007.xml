The Right hon J .H .Scullin, M.P.,Prime Minister of the Commonwealthof Australia, who had just paid a visit to the Prime Minister, was introduced to Members of the Cabinetwhile they were assembling.IMPERIAL trade policy and imperial ECON-CMIC MACHINERY.f Pr previous reference:Cabinet 55(30),  Con-clusion 3.)1. The Cabinet discussed the Board of TradefsMemorandum. ^C.P.,-313 (30)) which had been beforethem at their previous Meeting.In addition, there was handed round at the outset o^ the Meeting a copy of a letter addressed&apos;to the Prime Minister by the Trade Union congress general Council and the Federation of BritishIndustries, together with a Memorandum enclosedtherein fC .P.-317 (30)).The Cabinet noted that the Memorandum by theTrade Union Congress General Council and theFederation of British Industries was in no wayantagonistic to, but, on the contrary, rather onthe same lines as, the President oF the Board ofTrade&apos;s Memorandum summarised in the Conclusionsof the Cabinet referred to in the margin.The Cabinet were informed that, as the resulto^ a consultation between the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs and the President of theBoard of Trade,  it was thought advisable not to .produce the President of the Board of Trade&apos;sMemorandum at the outset of the Imperial Confer-ence, but to await the results of the general discussion on economic questions .    It would be useful if.some of the Dominions representativesmade proposals of a similar nature.    The cabinet were asked not to regard the scheme contained inthe Memorandum as a rigid one, but rather as the
basis of the Governments policy, and subject to possible amendment in detail if the course ofevents in the Imperial Conference should renderthis desirable.Some emphasis was laid in the oourse of thediscussion on the importance of bringing togetherbusiness men and Labour representatives connectedwith corresponding industries in the United Kingdom,and the Dominions respectively,  in order to acquaintthem with the realities and difficulties of someof the methods of co-operation proposed in thepublic discussions on the subject, w^ieh are apt to be too readily accepted.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To accept the Memorandum by thePresident of the Eoard of Trade(C,P.-313 (30))  as the basis ofthe Governments policy at theImperial Conference on the subjects with which it dealt:(b) That the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs and the Presi-dent of the Board of Trade should consider and advise how repre-sentatives o^ industry and of theTrade Union Congress could best be brought in contact withrepresentatives  of the dominions on Imperial trade questions .
UNEMPLOYMENTSTATISTICS.(Pr ev i 011sReference:Cabinet 54(30),  Con-conclusion ion IS.)unemployment policy .(previous reference:Cabinet 33(30),  Con-clusion 8.)2. Trie Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Minister of Labour &apos; CP.-308 (30)) inregard to the unusually large increase of over79,000 in the live register on September 8th.Arising out of this Memorandum a discussionof a preliminary nature took place covering thewhole field Of Unemployment Policy in its Parlia-mentary and general aspects.    In the course ofthis discussion the Cabinet examined the extentof the relief works which they had initiated andwhich were generally agreed to be as large asthey should be in existing circumstances .    It waspointed out that in the Parliamentary discussions the question was almost certain to be raised as towhether the sums allotted to such schemes were actually being spent and whether an adequateincrease in employment was resulting .   The anomalieswhich had arisen in the existing abnormal circumstances-stances in regard to Unemployment Insurance were referred to as a matter requiring consideration bythe Ministers  concerned before the meeting ofParliament.   The need for improving the psychologicalattitude towards trade prospects was also referredto..    Attention was drawn to the re-organisation ofTrade Commissions, which had produced good results&quot;,to the effect of events in India on trade (thoughthe reaction of the boycott on trade had probably been exaggerated):    and to the slightly more hopeful situation in China, both politically andfrom .the point of view of silver..Discussion took place in regard to the desira-bility of taking some steps to modernise industry,including, if necessary, the acquisition by the
Government of further powers, such as had alreadybeen obtained in the case of Coal.    In this connec-tion the slow progress made by the industries concerned in implementing the Reports of theCommittees on Cotton and Iron and Steel respective-ly was  criticised.    In connection with Cotton theHome Secretary informed his colleagues that aMemorandum was in course of preparation,  and wouldbe circulated very shortly,  describing the courseof events since the Report was issued.    In connee-tion with Steel the Cabinet were informed that progress was being hampered by the desire of manyof those concerned for a tariff,  or for somothingmuch more drastic, such as a prohibition of theimportation of foreign iron and steel, and by their belief that by waiting they would obtain it.Agriculture was advocated as one of the long-range methods of dealing with Unemployment, and proposals for the development of allotments and small holdings in small industrial districts that have become derelict owing to rationalisation or similar causes evoked considerable interest.    Inthis connection the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries gave an outline of the plans he wasmaturing in anticipation of forthcoming legislation.Afforestation was discussed from the same point ofv i ew .The subject was adjourned, with the intention0&quot;&quot; its being taken up again as soon as the CabinetCommittee, set up on September 19th (Cabinet 54(30), Conclusion 5) had received the Memorandumof the Economic Advisory Council and was able toreport .2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,September 25, 1930.
