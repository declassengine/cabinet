Delegations ..   &apos;He explained that in this framework hehad left blank the passage relating to existing ImperialPreferenc es.^The Prime Minister was absent duringthe discussion of the framework, butreturned before the end of the Meeting.)The framework commended itself to; those present,although it was recognised that it would require a gooddeal of amendment to bring it into line with the Cabinet&apos;decisions.    Among other points it was suggested that thestatement should be drawn up as a United Kingdom Delega-tion statement, and not as personal by the Prime minister or by one of the members ,Towards the end of the Meeting the Chancellorof the Exchequer intimated that he would be willing toprepare a draft statement of the United Kingdom casein regard to existing Preferences to the Dominions.In this statement he would give a history of the attitude taken up on this question in the past by the government now in power.   He would explain what the present diffi*-culty was, but he would propose to make it clear thatthe Government could not undertake to abandon theirpolicy for the remission of taxes on food if the financial situation should change and render this possible.    Hewould then give a statement o^ the facts of the existing financial situation, which rendered it unlikely that theduties on certain foodstuffs would be removed for sometime.    He adhered to the attitude he had taken at the&apos;Cabinet in regard to the duties and preferences ontobacco, wines and. spirits, which it was not the policyof the Govern ent to remove..His colleagues asked the Chancellor of theExchequer to draft the Statement&apos; iff*as--palatable a form;as possible for the Dominions.

NO DISTRIBUTION       PRIME MINISTER ONLY.(This Document is the Property of His BritannicMajesty&apos;s Government.)- S E ORE T -CABINET.COMMITTEE ON EXISTING IMPERIALPREFERENCES.Secretary&apos;s Notes of a Meeting held on WEDNESDAY,OCTOBER 29, 19SO,  at 5-30 p.m., in the PrimeMinister&apos;s Room, House of Commons.PRESENT  :-The Right Hon. J. Ramsay MacDonald, M.P.,Prime Minister    (in the Chair) .The Right Hon. Philip Snow den, M.P.,Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Right Hon. Arthur Henderson, M.P.,Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.The Right Hon. J.H. Thomas, M.P., Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs .The Right Hon. William Graham, M.P.^President of the Board of Trade.Colonel Sir Maurice Hankey, G .C .B .,G .C .M.G.,Secretary, Cabinet.
The Committee had been appointed by the Cabinetthe same morning to consider questions raised by theChancellor of the Exchequer in regard to existingImperial Preferences accorded by the United kingdom to the Dominions.THE PRIME MINISTER said he thought the question had been settled on the previous evening.   He explained the new situation that had arisen as the result ofMr Snowden&apos;s intervention at the end of the cabinet meeting the same morning.Mr HENDERSON wondered why Mr Snowden&apos;s statement had been deferred so late in the Meeting.   He himself had had to withdraw to see the Russian Ambassador, whowas already waiting for him at the Foreign Office.He recalled that the Cabinet had discussed thearrangements for certain Committees of the ImperialConference, and it seemed a pity that Mr Snowrden hadnot brought forward his difficulty then.Mr SNOWDEN said he had anticipated that the other business of the Cabinet would be finished earlier.He had warned the Prime Minister about noon that he wanted to raise the question of the existing prefer-ences.THE PRIME MINISTER recalled that some of the bills submitted by the Committee of Home Affairs had led to longer discussion than usual.   Turning to thebusiness, he felt convinced that somethingmust be done if agreement was to be reached.Mr SNOWDEN said it appeared that to get anagreement that would satisfy the Dominions we must give up something to people who had never given usanything, but, on the contrary, had put tariffsagainst us .
Mr HENDERSON pointed out that that was not thedecision of the Cabinet.   He thought it had beenaccepted that, as part of the proposed agreement,the Dominions were not to alter the tariff positionagainst us while the preferences were maintained.Mr SNOWDEN said he himself had made the point that there should be a guarantee that the dominions would not raise their tariffs against us.Mr THOMAS quoted a mass of evidence to showthat it was incorrect to say that the Dominions gave us nothing.   On the contrary, their preferences hadbeen of great value, and had been increased in recentyears.    For example, Canada, in 1928, had given a tariff preference on textiles, and last year Mr Mac-kenzie-King had raised the preference on steel.   Butfor these preferences a large amount of trade wouldhave gone to America.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that what wewere offering was not much more than to enable themto say &quot;Thank you&quot;.   The Dominions were willing inreturn to help us in their tariffs.   Mr Scullin, inparticular, had made helpful suggestions.Mr HENDERSON said he had been under the impres-sion that a compromise had been reached on the previous evening.Mr SNOWDEN regretted that Mr Henderson had notbeen present at the Cabinet that morning.   When,  onthe previous evening, he had read a statement from a paper, to which he was not in the least committed,he had been surprised, at the favourable receptionit received.   He recalled that when he wanted toinclude in the statement to the Dominions on exist in?food preferences the reason why they were not removed,
namely, the financial situation, Mr Thomas had  remarked that that only made matters worse.Mr THOMAS said he had only suggested that it was taking away from the value of the declaration.Mr HENDERSON said that the Government were engagedin the Imperial Conference at a time when the economicsituation was as had as it had been for 25 years past.They could not look at Mr Bennett?s programme.   Werethey to meet people drawn from thousands of miles away with a complete negative?   We had told them that wecould not accept their proposals;    they had replied,&quot;What are your proposals?&quot;    In regard to these foodpreferences they asked &quot;How long -will they last?&quot;His own view was that we should take advantage of thepresent bad financial situation to say that in alllikelihood they would not be removed for the next twoor three years;    that is to say, before the nextConference.    Surely it was not a bad position to have this situation explored in the interim, and then, atthe end,  either remove them or not.   This stabilisation of the position would be on the und erst and ing that theDominions would not alter their tariffs in the periodnamed.    In addition, he understood that as regardstobacco, spirits and wines, Mr Snowden did not propose any change.Mr SNOWDEN said there was no difficulty there.The retention of these duties was part of the Govern-menfs policy.Mr HENDERSON said that as regards the secondcategory he understood that Mr Snowden had been willingto maintain the duties until the next Imperial Confer-ence, but that the matter had not been settled and thatMr Snowden was to let the Cabinet know what he thought
&quot;before a statement was made.   As regards the. McKennaDuties he understood that Mr Snowden would give noundertaking.    He did not believe there was very muchbetween his position ,and Mr Snowden&apos;s, provided thatMr Snowden was willing to announce that there would beno change for the next year or two.Mr SNOWDEN said he would never agree to delegatethe decision to the next Imperial Conference.Mr HENDERSON agreed.    It was a period of time that had been contemplated.   What he would like MrSnowden to do would be to prepare a draft himself and submit it to the Prime Minister.Mr SNOWDEN said he could not submit to any dieta-tion from any outside body such as the Imperial Confer-ence.   He must insist on fiscal autonomy.Mr HENDERSON agreed.Mr THOMAS said he thought Mr Snowden ought to beproud of the way in which his colleagues appreciatedhis difficulties.   He himself had always tried, evenin the most difficult circumstances, to appreciate theChancellor&apos;s position.   On the previous evening, forinstance, he had understood Mr Snowden&apos;s difficultiesin regard to the Wheat Quota.   The whole Cabinet had met the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s views on that.Then had come up the question of the existing prefer-ences, and he had felt that the financial position was such that Mr Snowden was in a position to say that hewould not remove the preferences.   As Mr Henderson had said, we could obtain from the Dominions in return anundertaking not to raise tariffs against us.THE PRIME MINISTER, who had to withdraw to see Mr Scullin, made an appeal to Mr Snowden to recognise the Cabinet&apos;s difficulties.
(The Prime Minister left at thispoint to see Mr Seullin.)Mr GRAHAM said that there were three main ques-tions before the Cabinet on the previous evening:the Quota, the Preferences, the Machinery.   All theother subjects would be referred to the inter-Imperialmachinery if it were established.   His Committee hadspent a fortnight considering the Quota.    In effect the Cabinet decision required him to try and obtain a &quot;Pro-and-Con&quot; Report from his Committee.   This wasbeing prepared, and he would try and get it throughthe Committee.    It was possible that the Dominionsmight say &quot;But this is a new situation you are confront-ing us with;    we do not want a Pro-and-Con Report;we want the Quota&quot;.   He himself would then have tosay that there was no decision in regard to the Quotaand to ask that the matter might come back to theUnited Kingdom Delegation and to the Heads of Delega-tions.   Then, in the end,  it was contemplated thatall that would happen as regards the Quota would bethat It would be referred to the inter-Imperialmachinery.   In the meanwhile there would be an examina-tion by Sir W. McLintock&apos;s Committee.   The effect ofall this was that a large part of the economic pro-posals would have ended in nothing.    Consequently thesecond-line proposals, in regard to existing prefer-ences, would acquire an enhanced importance. if mr Snowden&apos;s view was adopted, the Conference could result in nothing except the machinery, if that were accepted.    The Dominions would say &quot;There is no Quota,no declaration on existing tariffs, and nothing butmachinery&quot;.    Referring to his long association inmany matters with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, heappealed to him to assist in any way he could.
It would be a bad thing if the Conference broke down on the economic side.   The real question was as to&quot;whether the Imperial Conference was to set out on anew road.   As he viewed it, this road was analogous to the Tariff Truce.   The Dominions wanted tariffs;we wanted to avoid them.   We could only resist bytrying something in a new field.   The revenue positionas affecting the existing tariffs wras so clear thatit seemed to provide a means of beginning this newstep, which would enable us to say to the Dominions,as we were saying to foreign countries in connectionwith the Tariff Truce,  &quot;You must examine your tariff preferences as part of a common examination of theeconomic situation&quot;.   Was it not worth while to make this effort?    He quite understood the ChancellorTsposition, but if he maintained it we should have nothing to offer to the Dominions.   He could not agreewith the Chancellor that a breakdown was of no import-ance.    It would play into the hands of the TariffReformers.Mr THOMAS said it would enable them to sweepthe country.Mr HENDERSON demurred to this as an exaggeration.Mr SNOWDEN said that the working-man did notcare very much about these questions . &apos;Mr THOMAS agreed that this was the case in normaliftimes, but^-in the present abnormal circumstances theConference broke down the Government would get the blame.Mr SNOWDEN thought not, if they had resistedfood taxes .Mr THOMAS explained, however, that in any event the existing taxes could not be removed, owing to thefinancial situation.
Mr HENDERSON recalled that the Cabinet had met mr. Snowden in regard to the Quota, so that a conces--   sion had been made there.    Then, with the assistanceof Lord Passfield&apos;s intervention, the Cabinet had gonethrough the existing preferences.   He thought theposition had been reached that Mr Snowden would allow the food preferences to continue for two or possibly three years.Mr SNOWDEN said he could not make a bargainaffecting our power to deal with taxation.Mr HENDERSON agreed.    It was not a concession to the Imperial Conference, but a statement of what had to be, owing to the revenue position.   He had understood that this was to be made.&apos; .       Mr SNOWDEN said that Mr Thomas&apos;objected to hismentioning the revenue argument.Mr HENDERSON read from the draft Minutes of theCabinet to show that Mr Snowden had merely been askedto consider whether he could give the undertaking forthree years instead of two.   He recalled that thePrime Minister had said &quot;two or,  if possible, threeyears&quot; .Mr SNOWDEN said that he might be able to make astatement to the Heads of Delegations on the following lines:    he would set out the government&apos;s policy inthe past, including their Election announcementssetting forth the policy of the Party.   He wouldstate that they were still hoping to abolish duties on food, though, owing to the financial situation,they had been unable to do it last year.    It was likely, however, that next year, and perhaps theyear about that, they might not be able to do it.Mr HENDERSON said that if Mr Snowden and thePrime Minister could put in half an hour in
elaborating such a statement he would accept anything that the two would agree to.    If this statement couldbe put more or less as Mr Snowden had put it that evening, and if he went into it in detail, he thoughtvery possibly he might find it feasible to indicatethat the duties would not be removed for three years.In regard to inter-Imperial machinery, he thoughteveryone was agreed.    If, then, all were so near agreement, was it worth while to run the risk of a Cabinetcrisis?Mr THOMAS thought, as the result of that evening&apos;s talk, the discussion was taking a betterline.Mr HENDERSON said that if he were drafting thestatement he would have lifted from the MinutesMr Scullin&apos;s request to know how long the duties wereto be maintained.   He wotild then have made a statementof our own fiscal position and policy.   After that hewould have explained the financial situation.   then he would have emphasised the machinery for developingtrade within the Empire.    Then, at a Meeting of Headsof Delegations, he would have made a statement on theslines and have insisted, in return, that Dominionstariffs should not be p\it against us .Mr THOMAS said the same idea had occurred to him and he had given instructions for the preparation of adraft framework into which some such statement as hadbeen discussed that evening might be fitted.   He thenproceeded to read the framework.Mr SNOWDEN said the framework was not quite a correct interpretation of what had been decided atthe Cabinet.Mr THOMAS thought it was a fair statement of thecase.
Mr SNOWDEN assented, provided certain amendments were made.Mr HENDERSON thought it was a very good basisof discussion, though it wanted a lot of touching-up.For example, he would like it framed as coming not from the Prime Minister himself but from the UnitedKingdom Delegation.Mr SNOWDEN intimated that he would be willingto prepare a draft statement of the United Kingdomcase in. regard to existing preferences to the Dominions.In this statement he would give a history of theattitude taken up on this question in the past by theGovernment now in power.   He would explain what thepresent difficulty was, but he would propose to makeit clear that the Government could not undertake toabandon their policy for the remission of taxes on food if the financial situation should change andrender this possible.   He would then give a statementof the facts of the existing financial situation,which rendered it unlikely that the duties on certainfoodstuffs would be removed for some time.   He adhered to the attitude he had taken at the Cabinet in regardto the duties and preferences on tobacco, wines andspirits, which it was not the policy of the Governmentto remove.Mr HENDERSON said that it would not demand avery big effort on Mr Showden&apos;s part, in order to get agreement in the Cabinet, to raise his figure to the,position of three years contemplated on the previous evening.   That would&apos;be his way out of the difficulty.He thought that Mr Snowden should now prepare a draft to fill in the gap in the framework Mr Thomas had read.He would be very surprised if, when Mr Snowden gotdown to details, he found it would be impossible to
meet the Cabinet&apos;s1 position.(The Prime Minister ret turned at this point.)Mr HENDERSON explained the position that had beenreached.   He asked what was the difficulty, given thepresent financial situation, in saying that we would allow the duties to remain on for two or three years?Mr SNOWDEN said it was a surrender of principle.THE PRIME MINISTER said that his position wasthat he would accept anything that his four colleagues would agree to.Mr HENDERSON explained the precise point of difference, which was a comparatively narrow one.He himself agreed to include a statement as to pastpolicy, but he did ask Mr Snowden to consider whether he could not meet his colleagues by going one stage further.THE PRIME MINISTER asked what was Mr Snow den&apos;sobjection ?   He was safe to assume that there couldbe no removal of the duties during the next two orthree years.Mr SNOWDEN said that this involved an assumptionand a commitment.THE PRIME MINISTER said that if Mr Snowden would say  &quot;You may assume&quot;, this would be regarded by theDominions as a pledge.Mr SNOWDEN said he would rather prefer that whatever was said should be implicit in the statement.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that the statementought not to include the state of the finances asbeing the reason.Mr SNOWDEN said that was the whole differencebetween him and his colleagues.   He was anxious,however, not to reach the last point of a crisis
without making every possible effort, and he felt itwas his duty to make the effort.Mr HENDERSON said that if Mr Snowden would takethe matter up with the Prime Minister, then they mightmeet again when he was ready.   He would like the frame-work read by Mr Thomas to be taken as the basis, into which Mr Snowden&apos;s statement could be fitted.THE PRIME MINISTER said all agreed to that.Mr HENDERSON suggested that they should meet again as soon as Mr Snowden was ready.2, Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.1,October 29, 1930 .-12-
