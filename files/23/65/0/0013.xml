cabinet procedure(previous reference:Cabinet 31(30), Con-elusion 12.)1.    The Prime Minister drew attention to the-poor attendance of Ministers at the Committee of HomeAffairs on the previous afternoon, when only one ofthe Cabinet Ministers who are regular members of theCommittee had found it possible to attend.   He also referred to the number of absentees from the Cabinetthe same morning.   He asked that his colleagues would bear in mind, in making appointments, that the cabinet has the first claim on their time.
g LONDONilAVAL TREATY.the Franco-Italian Nego-tiaUons .(previous reference:Cabinet 61(30), Con-elusion 2.)2.   The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs drew the attention of the Cabinet to various telegramsthat had been received, which did not confirm theinformation derived from Washington to the effectthat the French Government was about to buildadditional Battleships and Cruisers.    It appeared that at the present time the French shipbuilding programme was under consideration only in technicaldepartments of the Ministry of Marine, and that itwas unlikely that there would be so large a programme as had been rumoured.   He read the draft of a telegram to Washington reporting the results of these enquiriesand suggesting that perhaps, in the circumstances,more harm than good might result from putting pressure on the French Government.The Cabinet approved the telegramread to them by the Secretary ofState.
ijHB KING&apos; SSPEECH .(previous reference:Cabinet 60(30), Con-clue ion 2 ,)electoral reform,(previous reference:Cabinet 56(30)   (SeeEnvelope).Propos edCommittee onGovernmentExpenditure.3. The Cabinet had before them the first,draft and first revise of the King&apos;s Speech on theOpening of Parliament  (CP .-348 (30)).In the course of the discussion the PrimeMinister reported to his  colleagues conversationsof a political character which he had held duringthe last few days, and as the result of which certain proposals had been made for his  considera-tion for inclusion in the King&apos;s  Speech..-   It hadbeen pointed out in these conversatlbns that parliamentary difficulties were likely to arise ata very early stage of the Session, more particularlyin connection with the inclusion of the Trades&apos;Disputes Bill in the King&apos;s Speech unless some reference were made also to the question of electoral Reform.   The Cabinet were willing toinclude a reference to Electoral Reform in theKing&apos;s Speech, on the understanding that thepolitical conversations tomorrow on the subjectwill indicate some possibility of an agreement.The decision to include Electoral Reform was takenprovisionally only, and subject to further consider-ation at their next Meeting, when it was anticipatedthat additional information would be available..A second proposal from the same quarter,whichthe Prime Minister reported to the Cabinet, was thatthe King&apos;s Speech should contain an announcement ofa Commission of Inquiry into Government Expenditure.This proposal did not commend itself to the Cabinet.The Chancellor of the. Exchequer said that he had called for a Memorandum on the subject,
Agricultural A third proposal which the Prime Minister hadpolicy.received related to Agricultural Policy.    It had bean(previous reference: suggested that a Commission should be set up, on theCabinet 61        -(go), Con- lines of the Electricity Commission, for the purposeelusion 6.) &apos;.pf re-populating the land of the United Kingdom:that a large Loan, of  50,000,000 to  100,000,000,should be raised for the purpose:    and that thereshould be a policy of re-conditioning the&apos;land.The proposal  for a Commission commended itdelf inprinciple to some members of the Cabinet, but it was realised that the whole scheme required to be worked out in detail before any estimate could be made ofits cost, and the Minister of Agriculture and Pisher-ies and the Secretary of State for Scotland warnedtheir colleagues that the rate at which people couldbe settled on the land had been exaggerated *   Theinclusion of a reference in the King&apos;s Speech to there-conditioning of land was approved.A proposal to include a reference to regionaltown-planning was not accepted.   The Minister ofHealth reported that he had arranged to discuss thematter with the author of these proposals on thefollowing Monday.The Prime Minister said that he had receiveda suggestion from another quarter that as regardsUnemployment the King&apos;s Speech should contain anappeal that all sections of Parliament might uniteto find a solution of this pressing national problem.The Cabinet, while sympathetic to the general idea, felt that,in view of the failure of the effortthey had made during the previous Session to securethe co-operation of all Parties,  it would not be advisable to include a passage to this effect.
The Cabinet agreed  To approve the first, revise of theKing&apos;s Speech (C.P.-348 (30)),subject to the following additionsand alterations:-(a) The inclusion, as mentioned above,of references to Electoral Reform(provisional, subject to re-consideration at the next Meetingof the Cabinet) and to the re-conditioning of land:(b) Amendment of the 11th paragraphby the substitution for the words&quot;regulating the hours of industrial employment&quot; of the following:&quot;ratifying the Washington hours convention&quot;:(c) That in regard to paragraph 12the Minister of Health should consider w-hether the wording of the reference to the modi-fication and extension of town-planning powers might not be improved:(d) Omission from the 13th paragraphof the reference to the ChildrenAct, and the inclusion of a reference to the Factory Actsin paragraph 12 * instead of inparagraph 13, which would disappear.
PAREBAMEJMTARY 4*   Among the proposals mentioned &quot;by the PrimePROCEDURE.Minister as having arisen In the conversations refer-(Previous &quot;red to in the preceding Minute, was one that, in viewReference: -Cabinet 33       of the great importance of dealing with Unemployment(30), Con-elusion 6.)     during the forthcoming Session, the Government shouldtake the whole of the time of Private Members and make liberal use of guillotine Resolutions.The Cabinet concurred in the above proposals .
MILITARY CON-TRIBUTIONSBY colonial governments .The Governor-ship ofBermuda.(previous reference:Cabinet 57(30), Oon-clusion 13.)5. Tbe Cabinet had before them a Joint Memo-randum by tbe Secretaries of State for the colonies and for War (CP.-353 (30))  in regard to the appoint-ment of Governor of Bermuda.    It was pointed outthat  if a military Governor is not appointed, a civilian Governor will be necessary.   Allowing forhis salary, for the appointment of an Officer of the rank of Colonel to command the garrison, and for thecost to War Office funds of maintaining a Lieutenant-General on half pay, the financial result of thesubstitution of a civilian for a military governor would be an extra cost to the British taxpayer ofabout  1,850 a year.    It was agreed by the ColonialOffice and War Office, and in Bermuda, that the discontinuance of the present method of filling theappointment would result in a loss of Imperialprestige   The secretaries of State for the colonies and for War were therefore of opinion that theappointment should remain ae at present.In the course of a discussion on this questionit was suggested that the whole subject of ColonialGovernorships and salaries might with advantage be investigated with a view to greater economy.The Cabinet agreed -That a representative of the treasury should confer further on the subject with the Secretary of State for theColonies and the Secretary of Statef or War.
J5SURAN.OB./previous^Refe^ence:Cabinet 61(30). Con-elusion 5.)POLICY.Re-organisa-tion ofIndustry .(previous reference:Cabinet 61(30), Con-conclusion 4.)6,   The Cabinet had before them an InterimReport by the Panel of Ministers on Unemployment(C.P.-354 (30)), in two parts, dealing respectively-with Unemployment Insurance and Industrial reconnaisance-struction.In the course of the discussion on UnemploymentInsurance considerable stress was laid on the import-ance of taking early steps to abolish abuses ifevidence of such abuses becomes available, and theMinister of Labour was asked to expedite enquiries on this matter, as contemplated in the Report ofthe Cabinet Committee.The Prime Minister said he had given instr-uc-tions for the circulation of a report on the Germanunemployment insurance system, which threw light on many of the problems now under consideration.   Hecommended this report to his colleagues.In the absence of the President of the Board ofTrade the second part of the Report, dealing with industrial Reconstruction, was only discussed briefly.The Prime Minister asked the Panel of Ministers tocontinue its enquiries in consultation with thePresident of the Board of Trade.The Cabinet agreed  On the subject of UnemploymentInsurance, to approve generally the Conclusions of the Panel ofMinisters, which are as follows:-(a) Pending the result of an enquiry bya Royal Commission, we are unable torecommend any reduction in benefitsor increase in contributions.(t) We recommend the appointment of a royal Commission, with terms ofreference on the following lines:-*To review the provisions answorking of the UnemploymentInsurance Scheme, and to make recommendations with regard to(i) its future scope, theprovisions which it should
contain and the means &quot;bywhich it may be made solventand self-supporting, and(ii) the arrangements which shouldbe made outside the scheme for assisting the unemployed&quot;.The Commission should be instructed toissue interim reports - the first ofsuch reports to deal with the questiono^ transitional benefits, to be followedby reports on the general issues involvedin the payment of benefit to -(l) seasonal workers;(2) short-time workers;(3) married women.(NOTE:    While the above was approved in principle, it was suggestedthat the wording might be improved.)(c) The Minister of Labour was asked tosupply specific cases in support ofalleged abuses involved in payment ofbenefit to -(i) seasonal workers;(2) short-time workers;(3) married women;(4) transitional benefit in caseswhere no hardship would be created by withholding it.(d) We agree that if concrete evidencebecomes available of specific abuseswhich should not be tolerated, theMinister of Labour should be author-is ed to take the necessary steps to abolish them, but before any decision is taken the Panel should be given a further opportunity of consideringthe evidence.
THE expiring laws CONTINU-ANCE BILL,1950.(pr previous reference:Cabinet 53(30)., Con-eltision 1.)The Dyes tuffs(Import Regu-lation) Act,1920 .7.     As the main point for consideration bythe Cabinet in connection with the Expiring laws continuance Bill, 1930, was the question of theinclusion in the Bill of the Dyestuffs (importRegulation) Act, 1920, and as the President of theBoard of Trade was unable to be present, theCabinet postponed this question until their next meeting .

Peel.The Secretary of State for India pointed outthat if the Despatch was published it would be verydifficult later on for the Home Government to refuseany advance which had been offered by the Governmentof India.

AtLlandudno a suggestion had been made to the HomeSecretary that the Syine case should be referredto a committee consisting  of the Lord Chancellor,the Lord President of the Council and the attorney general.    The Home Secretary had replied thatany such proposal would require careful considera-tion but that he personally, as Home Secretary,would place no obstacle in the way.    The Home.Secretary had reminded the Prime Minister, however,that a fresh Inquiry in the absence o^ any new factsmight be regarded as impugning the impartialityof the Judicial Inquiry set up by the labour government in 1924.    Syme had given an undertaking to abide by the findings of that Commission but hadnot done so,  and there was no reason to suppose that he would abide by the findings pf a new Inquiryeven if he again gave an undertaking to do so.The Cabinet did not agree to theproposed Committee of Inquiry.-22-
