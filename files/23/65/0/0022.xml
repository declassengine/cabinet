1. The President  of the Board of Tradegave the Cabinet a summary of the present positionin regard to the Goal situation..   In nearly allthe coalfields no? difficulty existed at themoment..   Temporary working arrangements had been arrived at for carrying on in the different-districts..    The only critical situation was inthe Scottish coalfields..    There had been two meetings of the Scottish miners, and a decisivevote had been passed against the adoption of the&quot;spread-over&quot;.    The main problem arose in connec-tion with the coming meeting of the Miners&apos;Federation.    On Friday of last week the Federationhad decided against the spread-over.    At that meeting the Scottish miners had been in favourof the spread-over.    Lancashire and Cheshire hadbeen neutral.   Yorkshire had voted against the spread-over.    At the forthcoming meeting theScottish delegates, after the vote to which he had referred, would be bound, he feared, to vote against the spread-over.    The Lancashire andCheshire miners were likely to take the sameattitude as the Scottish miners.    It was difficultto see. therefore, how the decision of the previous friday could be reversed without some special arrangement.&apos;   The Prime Minister and some of hiscolleagues were.to see the representatives of theMiners&apos; Federation tonight.    One solution thatarose for consideration was as to whether theGovernment should take action to reverse theprovisions of the Coal Mines Act that the Miners&apos;Federation must be consulted and must approve the adoption of the spread-over In a district-.
That would, entail legislation and would involvethe Government in difficulties.   The attorney general had pointed out that the action of those districts which were working the spread-over wasillegal in view of the decision of the Miners&apos;Federation.    To legalise their action it would benecessary for the districts to consult the Miners&apos;Federation and for the latter to give their approval,  involving a reversal of their previous decision.    The position would be legalised for thefuture in the event of a favourable decision byEv enthe Miners&apos; Federation on Thursday, /in that casethe suggestion had been made that an Act of indemnity-nity.ought to be passed, but the matter had notbeen considered urgent at the moment,  especiallyin view of the probable attitude of the Miners&apos;Federation,     If, as was expected, the Miners&apos;Federation were still adverse, the position would arise in a more acute form, because a considerablenumber of the mining districts would be workingillegally .In the course of the discussion it waspointed out that the Scottish miners, by -refusing to work under the system of the spread-over,which was  illegal, would be entitled to claimunemployment benefit.   If other districts followedtheir example the miners affected would also beentitled to unemployment benefit., and a veryconsiderable sum would be Involved,..   Moreover, itwould place the State in a position of paying partof the cost of an economic dispute.The President of the Board of trade informed his colleagues that the. legislation required, in the event of it being decided as
desirable to eliminate the necessity of a.districtconsulting the Miners&apos;  Federation before adopting the spread-over, had been drafted..The position was recognised to depend to agreat extent -upon the attitude to be adopted bythe Miners&apos; Federation on Thursday.    If they should decide to reverse the vote of the previous Fridaythe difficulties to a great  extent would disappear.If, on the other hand,  as appeared more probableon the available evidence, they should adhere totheir previous decision, the situation wouldrequire further consideration.Various suggestions were made for dealingwith the situation.    For example,  it was proposedthat the Miners1  Federation might be induced topass a resolution stating that their consent wasgiven automatically to the working of the spread-over by any district which had passed a resolution to that effect.    This would legalise the positionin the greater number of the districts, but without surmounting the difficulties in Scotland.Another suggestion was that the whole of the factsshould be placed before the Miners&apos; Federation,who should be faced with the responsibility whichlay upon them.    It was pointed out, however, thatthe Executive of the Miners&apos;  Federation could,reply that they had already done their utmost torender possible the adoption of the spread-over,firstly by voting for it at the Industrial Eoard,and, secondly, by their attitude at the Delegatemeeting of the Miners&apos;  Federation.    A thirdsuggestion was that the members of the
Cabinet principally concerned should avail themselves of any possible opportunity to address the Delegate meeting.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To leave the question to the PrimeMinister, the President of theBoard of Trade, and any other colleagues who were to see theExecutive of the Miners&apos;  Federa-tion the same evening:(c) That the President of the Boardof Trade should notify membersof the Cabinet at the earliest opportunity of the results o^ that meeting :(c) That if the Executive of theMiners&apos;  Federation should suggestthat the Prime Minister and/or his colleagues should attend the delegate Meeting of the Miners&apos;Federation, they should acceptthe invitation:(d) That, if necessary, an emergencymeeting of the Cabinet should be summoned on Thursday or Friday.
F ]jfp;STtrPPS 2. The President of the Board of TradeIpORT RLGULA-ijl) ACT, 1920.       informed the Cabinet that on the previous evening he had been approached by some of the Leaders ofeviousPferpnce: the Liberal Party, who had informed him that,  to68en)   Con- their surprise, a certain number of menbers of thatfusion 6.)Party were opposed to the non-renewal of theDyestu^fs (Import Regulation) Act, 1920.    Therehad been no fornal vote on the subject, but on ashow of hands 17 out of 27 Liberal members present at a meeting had been in favour of the renewal ofthe Act.   There was, however, no certainty thatthey would translate their attitude into an adversevote.    The two points on which anxiety had been expressed were research and the possibility of limiting agreements being concluded with the german industry as the result of the lapse of the Act.    Inregard to research, the President of the Board ofTrade felt justified in giving assurances thatin his view it was not likely to be affectedvery seriously.    On the other point, a proposal hadbeen made that a Pill should be passed providing that, notwithstanding the lapse of the DyestuffsfImport Regulation) Act, 1920, it should be renew-able by O^r-der in Council.    The President of theBoard of Trade had pointed out that this was difficult.    This attitude of a portion of theLiberal Party was contrary to the indicationswhich had teen given to the Government by theLeaders of that Party before the Cabinet took its decision.In the course of the discussion a suggestion was made that the Government should adhere to their decision but should not treat an adverse vote as&apos;one    of confidence,
After a short discussion the cabinet agreed  To adhere to their decision thatthe Dyestuffs  (import Regulation)Act, 1920, should not be renewed.
3. The Prime Minister gave his colleaguesparticulars of the Parliamentary programme up toChristmas and between Christmas and Easter.    Asregards the date 0* the adjournment,  in view of thefact that Christmas Day fell on a Thursday, he was advised that It would be better that the House ofCommons should not meet in Christmas week.   Asregards the date of re-assembly, from the point ofview of the Indian Round-Table Conference it was desirable that those members of the Cabinet whowere concerned should be able to devote as much time as possible to the later stages  of that conference, in which case its prospects were satisfactory.    This year the House of commons had assembled on January Ofebfa.    On a detailed analysis of the position, however, the PrimeMinister showed that if that date were adopted for the re-assembly of Parliament, the time avail-able for the major business of the Government wouldbe wholly inadequate.In the course of the discussion it became clear that, a^ter allowing for Private Members&apos;time, to advance the date of re-assembly to january 20th. would only give two additionalfor Government business.working  days/^    On the other hand,  to advance   thedate until January l^th would give five days forGovernment business.    It was suggested that thebusiness during the first fortnight 7. ight be soadjusted as to enable the Prime Minister himself and those of his colleagues who were taking partin the Indian Round-Table Conference to absentthemselves from the House of Commons .    It waspointed out, however, that in view of the Govern-menfs pledges it was indispensable that the
Trade Disputes Bill should he introduced duringthe first fortnight.After a careful review of the wholequestion,  the Cabinet agreed  (a) That the House of Commons shouldhe asked to meet on Tuesday,January 13,  19 31:(b) That the Trade Disputes Billmust be introduced in the firstfortnight:(c) That the Trade Disputes Bill andthe Electoral Reform Bill shouldhe introduced in dummy before christmas:(d) That, subject to the above, thebusiness should be arranged, asfar as possible,  to release thePrime Minister, the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs, theSecretary of State for DominionAffairs, and the Secretary ofState for India,  for their duties in connection with the indian round-Table Conference
&amp; EFFECT OFKOiONGrSDEMPLOYMENT ONH3 TITLE TO..iTH INSURANCEND WIDOWS&apos; ANDLD AGE PENSIONS,previous reference:Icabinet 681(50), Con-l:clusion 2).if.    The Secretary of State for Scotland informed the Cabinet that as a result of a consultationhe hau. had with the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Minister of Health, it had been agreedthat he should re-open the question of the effectof prolonged unemployment on the title to HealthInsurance and Widows&apos; and Old Age pensions, whichhad been decided by the Cabinet at the meeting referred to in the margin.       He recalled thatthe decision of the Cabinet had been to continueinsurance until the 31st December,  1951  for pension purposes only, with no title to HealthInsurance benefits.     All his information went to show that when the Government attempted togive effect to their decision they   would be faced with a sea of discontent. -   This, hesuggested, might not be confined to theGovernment supporters.      The great interest thatwas felt in the question was shown by thenumber of questions that had been put to theMinister of Health and himself, but the decisionof the Cabinet had not yet been announced.      Themovingconsultative Committee were/to see the Ministerof Health on the subject.     He urged,  therefore,that their previous decision should be alteredand&apos;,&apos; that an extension should be given to insurance to the 51st December,  19^&quot;!*  on the same terms as those of the present transitionalregulations (i.e.,  insurance for all healthinsurance benefits and pensions subject to half-rates of sickness and disablement benefit).
He thought that the total number of persons affectedwould not exceed from 50 &quot;thousand to 100 thousand,and the cost to the Exchequer would not be very-great.      Those concerned were the poorest class ofthe population.In the subsequent discussion it was pointed outthat if the Cabinet&apos;s present decision were adhered to, an unemployed man might be receiving transitional benefit as long as he was fit and well, but themoment he was struck down with sickness he would lose his unemployment benefit without receiving anysickness benefit.      This was unjust and would be extremely difficult to defend.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, whileappreciating &quot;tfoestre ngth of the case in favour of extending the Cabinet&apos;s decision, was unable toaccept the view that the cost to the Exchequer wouldbe as small as it had been suggested.      He warned the Cabinet, and asked them to take note,  that inhis view there was a possibility that the financialresult might be similar to that which had occurred in the case of the transitional benefit, the cost ofwhich had already far exceeded the original estimate.If this occurred, his colleagues must take theresponsibility.The Cabinet agreed  To approve the extension of insurance to the jjist December,  l^p^, on ^nesame terms as those of the presenttransitional.regulations,  (i.e., insurance for all health insurance benefits and pensions, subject to half-rates of sickness and disablement benefit).
jHE EDUCATION(SCHOOL ATTEND-AKC3)  BILL,  1930.(previous reference:Cabinet 68(50;, Con-clusion if) .5.     The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Paper No.CP. 405 (^O)), bringing to the notice of theCabinet important financial reactions of theEducation (School Attendance) Bill, of which hehad only just been informed.      As a result of raising the school leaving age to 15, anadditional charge would be thrown upon thePensions Account estimated at  ^.00,000 in thefirst full year, rising  lf50,0OQ per annum inconnection with Section I (2)   of the contributory pensions Act 1925.      In addition there would bean increase estimated roughly at  500*000 perannum under the provisions of the UnemploymentInsurance Acts relating to children under full-time instruction in a day school.      Thus the bill as it now stands may involve the expenditure from public funds of nearly  1 million a year inrespect of cases in which it is also proposedto give maintenance allowances from Education   *Funds (60 per cent of which will fall upon theExchequer).       A position under the War PensionsActs,  somewhat similar to the foregoing, wasalso referred to.As the above financial reactions had not been mentioned in the financial memorandum that hadaccompanied the Bill,  the Chancellor of theExchequer considered it essential that someappropriate action should be taken to notifyParliament of the position.      He suggested thatthis might be done by means of a revisedfinancial memorandum.      If nothing was done theoversight would be discovered and the Government

accused of bad faith.An alternative suggestion was that parliament should be informed by means of a veryfull answer to an unstarred question.After some discussion,  the Cabinet agreed  That the Chancellor of theExchequer should consider carefully in what form the communication had best be made toParliament, and should take action accordingly.NOTE:-     The Minister of Health mentioned thata similar point had arisen in connection with anew clause to be moved in the Bill.      As thisclause was not likely to be dealt with before thenext meeting of the Cabinet, the Prime Ministerinvited the Minister of Health to bring thematter up at the next meeting.

(^O) 29),thatbut/the Summary of Proceedings of the ImperialConference contained no reference to this matter,and the question had not been discussed..As it had not been found possible to induce theBritish Oil Companies to explore for oil inBritish Guiana, owing to their disbelief in its existence in commercial quantities,  the Secretaryof State reported in this Memorandum that he was now anxious, on grounds of general policy in theColony,  that the embargo   on the operation offoreign countries in British Guiana should beremoved at once, and that,  if the Cabinet saw noobjection, he proposed to inform the Governor ofBritish Guiana to that effect, on the understandingthat the latter would not be empowered to makeany definitive arrangements with foreign interestswithout his own express approval.The Cabinet approved the proposal of the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.
