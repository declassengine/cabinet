AGRICULTURAL 1.    in view       the reference in a speech Ly thPOLICY. J -Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries to &quot;the(Previous Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s pledge&quot;, the reference: . *Cabinet 48 Chancellor of the Exchequer asked permission to(30),  Con-conclusion 1.) make clear to the Cabinet his position in regardto cereal-growing in this country, which was more than ever important in view of the provi-sional inclusion of a Cereals Bill in a list of measures to be mentioned in the King&apos;s Speech.He pointed out that the operative part of the pledge was as follows:-&quot;But as soon as the conclusionsof the Imperial Conference are known, the Government will undertake whatever practicable steps can be devised to putcereal-growing in this country on an economic foundation&quot;.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out thatthis statement must be read in the light of therepeated declarations by the Prime Minister andothers that crude subsidies and Protection arein any event ruled out of consideration.    More-over,  &quot;an economic foundation&quot; means that theindustry must be put upon a self-supporting basis and doe? not necessarily involve the maintenanceof the present area of cereal cultivation.    Inparticular,  the Chancellor of the Exchequer didnot regard the quota as a &quot;practicable step&quot;within the meaning of his statement.    In viewof the recent Cabinet discussion on Import Boardshe held also that here, too, there was no&quot;practicable step&quot; such as would justify a promise of legislation in the Fing&apos;s Speech.
IMPERIALCONFERENCE,19 30.Draft Statuteo f Wes til!inst er(previous reference:Cabinet 51(30), Con-conclusion l( o) .)2. The Cabinet had before their a Memorandumby the Attorney-General (C.3.-312 (30)) pointing out that if the Statute of ^est^inster were to be passed in its present form it would confirm and strengthen a contention which might be raised byany Dominion today that Great Britain had no right to confer Dominion status on any freshterritory without the consent of all the otherDominions.   The alternatives were discussedeither of facing the difficulty at the presenttime or of taking steps to postpone the question.Suggestions were made for carrying out either ofthese alternative   policies.   The Attorney-Generaladvocated facing up to the difficulty now, whichcould be accomplished by putting clear words intothe Statute of Westminster to record the right ofthis country to admit to Dominion status suchterritory as seems proper to her, without thenecessity of obtaining the consent of the otherDominions,, or, alternatively, by means of aResolution passed at the Imperial Conference.In the course of the discussion it was pointedout that if the question were not faced at theforthcoming Lmpsrial Conference, the right of theUnited Kingdom! to admit India or some other partof the Empire to Dominion status might be challengedand be referred, at the instance of one of theDominions    to the Imperial Tribunal which it wasNOTE:    The draft of the Statute of Westminster hadnot been circulated to members of the Cabinet.It was explained at the Meeting that theoriginal drsft, after preliminary considera-tion by the Imperial Conference Policy Com-mittee, had been referred back to the LegalAuthorities for re-drafting.   The re-draft wasnot yet available, and it had not been thought desirable to circulate an obsolete draft to members cf the Cabinet.
proposed to set up,    It was pointed, out also thatif the United Kingdom claimed the right to Toe ableto raise some part of the territory, for theadministration of which she was now responsible,to the status of a Dominion, the same right mightlater be claimed by one or other of the Dominionswhich have equality of status v-Ith the UnitedKingdom^  e.g., Australia, In connection with western Australia;    South Africa in connectionwith Natal.There was general agreement that the statute of Westminster should not be submitted to theConference in any form which would prejudice the admission of India to Dominion status,  although in any modification of the draft Bill in order toavoid this difficulty it was important not to mention India by name.The Attorney-General pointed out that theamendment of the draft  Statute of Westminster inthe direction desired presented considerabledifficulty.    For example, the inclusion of thefourth paragraph of the preamble,  providing thatany alteration in the law touching the succession to the Throne or the Royal Style and. Title shallhereafter require the assent of the Parliamentsof the Dominions as well as of the United Kingdom&apos;,would in itself strengthen the claim of theDominions that their sovereignty would be prejudiced by the admission of a fresh Dominion with the same rights as themselves.A suggestion was made that the British north america Act might be found to provide an analogyaffecting the creation of fresh Dominions.
Attention was drawn to a distinction between thecreation of a Dominion, which no member of theCabinet disputed was within the rights of theUnited Kingdom, and the admission of the Dominionto the Imperial Conference, which,  on the analogy of the admission of India, might be claimed torequire a Resolution of the Conference itself.After considerable discussion, the cabinet agreed  (a) That at the forthcoming ImperialConference it would be desirableto discuss the various issues involved point by point,  and notto produce a draft of the statute of Westminster until Resolutionshad been agreed to covering thevarious points:(b) That in the meanwhile the Attorney-General, in consultation with theLegal Advisers of the GovernmentDepartments concerned, should preparealternative re-drafts of the statute of Westminster,  one or other ofwhich might be used according tothe course of events at theImperial Conference.    One draft should contain a statement ofthe right of this country to admitto Dominion status such territory as seems proper to her withoutobtaining the consent of the otherDominions.    In the other draft this issue should be evaded, but itshould secure, as far as possible,that India&apos;s  claim to become a dominion should not be prejudiced.
IMPERIAL. TRADE 3. Trie Cabinet had before them a MemorandumPOT ICY and imperial ECON-     by the President of the Board of Trade (C.P.-OMIC MACHINERY..  . 313 (30)), prepared in accordanee with the(Previous Cabinet Conclusion referred to in the margin,Reference:Cabinet 52 containing suggestions for a new organisation of(30),  Con-clusion 1(a).)    Imperial Economic Machinery, including anannual meeting of Ministers who come to theLeague of Nations Assembly each year,  an imperial Secretariat and a new Economic CommitteeThe Memorandum included suggestions  as to themethod of linking up the new machinery with theexisting bodies, namely, the Imperial EconomicCommittee, the Empire Marketing Board, theImperial Institute, the Executive Council ofthe Imperial Agricultural Bureaux, the imperial shipping Committee, the Overseas Mechanical.. Transport Council, the Imperial Institute ofEntomology, the Imperial Bureau of Mycology,the Imperial Eureau of Hygiene and TropicalDiseases, and the Imperial Goimmuni oat ionsAdv i s ory C omm i 11 e e .Since it had not been possible to circulate the Memorandum in time for thorough study by all members of the Cabinet,  the subject was adjourned until the morrow .
IMPERIALCONFERENCE,19 30 .PossibleWhite Paper(previous reference:Cabinet 52(30),  Con-elusion 2.)4.    The President of the Board of trade reported that good progress had been made inthe preparation of statistical tables for use atthe Imperial Conference, and perhaps for publica-tion.    He gave some particulars of the lines onwhich the tables were being drawn up,  and a short discussion took place thereon.The Prime Minister instructed the Secretary toput the subject of the Agenda for the morrow.
IMPERIAL .CONFrRFNCE,1930 .imply ement i ngof the report^ the Gonfer-once on theOperation ofDominionLegislation,etc., 192Q.(previous reference:Cabinet 51(30),  Oon-plus ion l(b) .)5. The Cabinet were informed that, before submitting his advice,  in accordance v;ith theCabinet Conclusion referred to in the margin,as to which portions of the Report of the Con^er-ence on the Operation of Dominion Legislation,etc., 19*29,  ought to be implemented at once, the attorney-General had expressed a desire to confer with the Prime Minister.    A. conference would takeplace on the subject the same afternoon.
PALESTINE. 6.     The Cabinet had before them a SecondPolicy in. Report drawn up by the Committee on Policy in,        . Palestine fO,P.-309 (30)) as the result of the(previous reference: discussion at the Meeting of the cabinet cabinet 54^30), Con- referred to in the margin.   Attached to the elusion 2.)Report was the Report of the Sub-Committeewhich had examined the financial aspects  of thescheme submitted to the Cabinet at the previous meeting.    The Conclusions and Recommendationsof the Cabinet Committee were summarised at theend of the Report in the following terms:-(i) His Majesty&apos;s Government are,  inour view, morally bound to seethat provision is made for thoseArab tenants who have been dis-possessed of their holdings as aresult of the manner in which thepolicy of the balfour declaration and the Mandate has hitherto been applied.    In view of the present state of the Palestine financesthis necessarily involves thegrant of some measure of financialassistance by the British Govern-ment.    No financial obligation,however,  of any kind rests on theGovernment in regard to the settle-ment of jews on the land for thepurpose of the Jewish National Home.(11) The Jewish organisations shouldbe permitted to proceed, at theirown expense, with the development and settlement of the &apos;reservedland&apos; acquired by them.   Thisland will suffice for Jewishsettlement in the next five years.(iii) To guard against the contingency of demands for further expenditurewhen the funds, now contemplated,are exhausted, the PalestineAdministration should take immediate steps (a) to provide,by means of legislation, thatduring the next five years nofurther parcels of land shall be acquired by Jewish organisations,in order to give time for theassimilation of the landlessArabs under the policywhich we recommend, and (b) to restrict the immigration of jews to such numbers as can be settledon the reserve lands, or can
confidently be expected to be absorbed into industrial ocoupa-tion.(iv) The Government of Palestine should,an soon as possible,  confer statu-tory &apos;occupancy rights&apos;   on agri-cultural tenants as proposed inthe Hope Simpson Report, and sosafeguard the future positionof the Arab occupants of the&apos;reserved land&apos;.(v) The dispossessed Arab familiesshould be resettled at a grosscost of (say)  2,500,000 in all,on the lines contemplated in theHope Simpson Report .    It shouldbe stated in any public announce-ment that the money is being provided for the development ofland, primarily for the settle-m ent  of landless Arabs, but thatthe settlement of Jews is not excluded from consideration,,(vi) Legislation will be required,and should be introduced as soonas possible,  authorising HisMajesty&apos;s Government to guaranteea loan to be raised by the palestine government,  of such amount as maybe required for the purpose in(iv) above.(vii) The provision from British votes of such annual amount as may berequired to meet the interest and sinking  fund charges on this loanduring the first five years.(viii) The draft Statement of Policyappended to CP,-301 (30),amended in accordance with theproposals contained in this Report,should be approved,  and its publi-cation authorised simultaneously with the publication of Sir J.Hope Simpson&apos;s Report.-After considerable discussion,  the cabinet agreed  (a)  To approve the Report of the CabinetCommittee,  (CP. 309 (30,), as wellas the publication,simultaneously with Sir John Hope Simpson&apos;s Report,of the draft statement of policy,(a ttached to CP. 30V (30)), whichwould be revised in accordance with conclusion (viii) abo^e;
(b) That the Secretary of State for theColonies should be authorised tocommunicate verbally to Dr. Weizman,in confidence,  the purport of sir john Hope Simpson&apos;s Report and ofthe draft statement of policy,together with such particulars ashe might deem advisable of theplan of development set forth inthe Report of the Cabinet Committee,(C.R.  3O9 (50)), and to discuss with him any points he might raisewith regard to their possible effects on the execution of the -Mandate and the Jewish Rational Home,The Secretary of State was aslcedto consider the desirability ofmentioning to Dr. Weizman the needfor limiting the immigration of jewish urban workers;(c) That, before seeing Dr. Weizman,the Secretary of State for theColonies might with advantageconfer privately with Lord Reading.
) Cabinet had before them the followingrelating to Maternity Mortality:-A Memorandum by the Minister ofHealth (C.P.-sr,0 (30)) whichhad been before the Cabinet attheir previous Meeting and.which contained a detailed scheme for dealing with MaternityMortality,  accompanied Ly parti-circulars of cost, which might beof the range of one to one and a half million pounds per annum;as well as the basic principlesof the cost of a possible alternative scheme which,  thoughless costly, was described in theMemorandum as less spectacular and politically less attractive thanthe maior scheme:A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Scotland (G.P.-310 (30))expressing agreement with thestatement of the Minister ofHealth of the difficulties whichhave to be overcome before the major scheme could be success-fully launched;    appreciating theserious additional financial commitment involved:    and suggest-ing,  in the circumstances, that further consideration might begiven to the alternative proposal,which would fit more closely withthe normal develops,ent of mat ernityservices by Local Authorities inScotland .In the last sentence of theMinister of Health&apos;s memorandum it was indicated that bettervalue might have been obtainedfrom National Health Insurancematernity benefit by providing that, a fixed proportion of it,say one half, was withheld untilevidence was given of attendance of a midwife or doctor on confine-ment .The Secretary of State fo&quot; Scotlandpointed out that this  implied thedisbursement of a large sum ofmoney annually in fees to indi-vidu^ls without the control and guarantees implied in a LocalAuthority provision.    He asked if it would not be possible tosecure the consent of the approved societies to an arrangement wherebyschemes of service provided by theLocal Authorities and approved bythe Central Departments weresubsidised,  e.g.., by some suchmethod as block grants fromNATI0NAI HEALTH J. TheINSURANCE.-- documentsMat ernity and specialist-Services .(previous reference:Cabinet 54(30),  Con-elusion 10 .)
Tnsxtranoe Funds on condition that certain benefits wouldbe given free of charge toinsured women and the wiveso^ insured men.The Gabinet agreed  (a) That the Minister of Health shouldbe authorised to proceed at orcewith the alternative and lesscostly scheme, but to announce thathe was in consultation with theauthorities concerned, with a viewto the preparation of a Billcarrying out the major scheme;(b) That the major scheme was adopted as above on the clear understandingthat it should not involve anycost to the Exchequer before april 1st, 1932, and that, if andwhen it should come into operation,the Minister of Health should do his utmost to secure economieson his Vote to counterbalance thecost.
EXPORT OP war materials   ANDWARSHIPS.(previous reference:Cabinet 46(30),  Con-clusion 7.)3.     The Cabinet had before them the following memoranda on the subject of the export of war materials, prepared as the result of the cabinet conclusion referred to in the margin:-A Memorandum by the Presidentof the Hoard of Trade (CP.-288(30)) pointing out that theBoard of Trade, as the licensing authority, always consult theService Departments and theForeign Office in regard to anyapplications for licences forthe exportation to foreigncountries of substantial quan-tities  of munitions, and that,except when objection is takenby one of the Departments con-suited, the Board of Trade issue the liccnoes without question.Instances were given of occasions when the exportation of munitions to particular destinations waseither absolutely stopped orrigidly curtailed owing to theattitude of other Departments,who were governed by the general principle that munitions shouldnot be sent to foreign countriesat times when the political horizonis  clouded and when there is a risk of the outbreak of war, foreignor civil, and more especially wherethere is any danger of the muni-tions being used against HisMajestyTs forces.    The Board ofTrade had no reason to believethat any substantial volume oforders had been lost owing to thefact that our armament firms haveto tender subject to their being able in due course to obtain a licence, whereas firms in othercountries were not similarlyhampered.    It was pointed outthat if eve&quot; the Arms TrafficInternational Convention was brought into force we should inany case be under an obligationto maintain the licensing system:also that even if it were decidedto abandon the requirement of individual licences it would stillbe inevitable that some restrictionshould be placed on the exportation0&quot;*&quot; munitions if political conditionsin foreign countries required it:A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for &quot;Sar (CP.-294 (30))covering a Memorandum prepared in the War Office showing theeffect of the present policy of
prohibiting the sale of Government-owned surplus arms and &quot;munitions toforeign Governments, whether directly or through private eon-tractors, and expressing theview that this embargo shouldbe raised excepi. in cases whereit is desirable to maintain it for political and military reasons,of which the Foreign Office and war Office would be the judges.In the War Office Memorandum evidence was given to shw that since theCabinet decisions of October 30,1929,  the demand for surplus arrmsand ammunition by certain foreigncountries has been maintained andis likely to continue,  and thatthese demands, instead of beingmet in this country, have been met abroad.    In short, the effectof the embargo had been, not toreduce the traffic in arms, butsimply to divert it into otherchannels, to the disadvantage of this country:A Memorandum by the First Lord ofthe Admiralty  (0.P.-314 (30))associating himself very stronglywith the proposal of the Secretaryof State for War for the abroga-tion of the Cabinet ruling on thesubject of the sale to foreigncountries of Government warmaterial.   Attached to his Memo-randum was a Paper prepared bythe Admiralty Staff, givinginstances of how seriously theexisting  embargo operates to the detriment of Eritish trade.    Inparticular, attention was drawn to a case no^&apos; requiring decision,in which Vickers Armst -&quot;ong&apos; s havemade enquiry for some high anglegun equipments for sale to theChinese Nationalist Government.Our refusal to supply this requirement, which could onlybe met from surplus stocks inthe possession of the Admiralty,would hamper the trading activitiesof the firm and, would be liableto be misunderstood by the ChineseGovc-nroent, whom we are assistingwith a Naval Mission and by thetraining of naval officers in ourNavy..   Even if the embargo were maintained, the First Lord sub-mitt ed that the application ehouldbe treated as outside the scope ofthe Oabinefa intention..   The ^emo-randum was extended to cover thecognate question of the private
export trade of this countryin warships and war material,and it was urged that at atime when the Admiralty&apos;orders are at a very low ebbit is important to do everything possible to remove obstacles fromthe way of this trade,  and thatthe Cabinet should give consider-ation to all possible measurestowards that end.    Prom the pointof view of the employment situa-tion it was a matter of serious concern, more especially as Italy is making special efforts, by long credit apparently withGove-nroent support, to secureevery possible order for foreignwarships and material.      In theaocompanying Admiralty staff memorandum it was pointed outthat many orders could be obtained by this  country if armament firmswere assisted neaterially so as tobe able to offer long term credit,which at present is not permitted under either the Cversea Trade(Credit and Insurance) Act,  19S0,or the Export    Credits Schemeand the Trade Facilities Act.Having regard to the fact that theCabinet&apos;s policy had failed to prevent or limitpurchases of war material by foreign countries,and had tended to stimulate the manufacture ofwar material in foreign countries,  to the detriment, not only of the armament trade, but of the general trade in this country,  theCabinet agreed  (a) To cancel their previous decision&quot;that the disposal of Governmentowned arms and munitions of war to foreign states, whether directly or through private contractors,should not be sanctioned&quot;.(Cabinet 4.2 (29), Conclusion 7, and cabinet 27 (2if) Conclusion 5) .(b) That in future the three service departments should, have authorityto sanction such sales, unless inany particular case the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs deemsthem undesirable.
(c^ That if any difficulty ofprinciple should arise in carryingout this decision,  the question should be referred to a CabinetCommittee composed as followsThe Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs,    (in the Chair),The Home Secretary,The President of the Board,of Trade,and the Minister or Ministers atthe head of the Service Department.  or Departments concerned in theparticular case.(d) That the wider question of removingobstacles from the export trade ofthis country in warships and war materials, raised in the Memorandumby the First Lord of the Admiralty,should be reserved for consideration at a later meeting of the Cabinet,after the return of the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs from geneva.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.12ifth September, 19J50.
