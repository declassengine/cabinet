with Imperial Chemical Industries in regard tofevious the wider aspects of hydrogenation of coal, withIferenoe:cabinet 61 a view to advising the Cabinet as to the policy&apos;0), Con-conclusion 3(a),,) to be pursued (Cabinet 47  (30),  Conclusion 4(b)).These enquiries had lately been continued by him in conjunction with the present Secretary of Statefor Air.   The technical practicability of thehydrogenation of coal could now be regarded asproved.    A larger proposition was now coming intoview,  and there was a possibility of a great plant-being established in the Midlands by imperial chemical Industries in connection with a coalfield.He and the Secretary of State for Air had consulted the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who concurredthat negotiations should proceed without committing the Cabinet to anything.    It -was not unlikely thatImperial Chemical Industries would put forward aproposal which would include a request for someguarantee of the continuation of the duty on imported petrol,  etc.^JThe Cabinet agreed  &apos;    (a) To authorise the President of theBoard of Trade and the Secretaryof State for Air to continue their negotiations with Imperial CheiDicalIndustries, on the understandingthat they should not commit theCabinet without consulting them,again:(b) That the Chancellor of the exchequer should be associated with thePresident of the Board of Trade andthe Secretary of State for A.ir, thethree Ministers forming a CabinetCommittee,, and that he should take part in the negotiations at such ^---&quot;&quot;]Btage as he might deem advisable.       jPRODUCTION 1. The President of the Board of Trade[oil ?wL reoalled that he and the late Secretary of Statejrogenation for Air had been invited by the Cabinet to conferJOoal.
UNEMPLOYMENT 2. The Prime Minister read the following termsINSURANCE.of reference proposed for the Royal Commission on(previous Unemployment Insurance:-Reference:Cabinet 68 &quot;To enquire into the provisions and(30), Con- working of the Unemployment Insuranceelusion 1.) Scheme and to make recommendations inregard to:-(i)  Its future scope,, the provisions which it should contain,  and themeans by which it may be madesolvent and self-supporting:and(ii) The arrangements ^hich should bemade outside the scheme for assisting the unemployed&quot;.The Minister of Labour reported that thegentleman whose name had commended itself to theCabinet at the previous Meeting as a suitableChairman was unlikely to be able to accept the post,The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the terms of reference as given above, subject to the addition,at the end of (ii), of some words toindicate that the &quot;unemployed&quot; referredto persons in the employment field:(b) That, in addition, there should bethe following instruction to theChairman:-The Commission should be asked topresent Interim Reports as may be practicable, and,  in particular,to accelerate the consideration ofthe question of transitionalbenefits.(c) That if the gentleman who had been invited to act as Chairman should be unable to accept, the Minister of labour should approach another gentleman whosename   had been mentioned to the Cabinetby the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs,  and should have authority toproceed on these lines with the settingup of the Royal Commission withoutfurther reference to the Cabinet .
* jSTRIALpreviousReference:Cabinet 68(30), Con-,elusion 10.)3. The Cabinet had under consideration the note by the President of the Board of Trade (C.P.-383 (30)) whioh had been before them, at the meeting referred to in the margin.The President of the Board of Trade reportedthat the Cabinet Committee set up at their last meeting had met.    The Secretary for Mines was nowin a position to set up the National IndustrialBoard,, and this could be done before the end ofthe present week.   He recalled that the mine-owners had always said that if there were a reduction inthe working time in the mines they -would be obligedto reduce wages.   The Government had hoped, however,that if Part I of the Act were in operationsufficiently early, the additional profits wouldprovide the owners with funds to enable them tocontinue the existing wages.   Unfortunately thecompletion of the district schemes had proceededsomewhat slowly, and this was not the case.   Theposition was rendered critical by the determina-tion of the owners,  on the last day of the present month, to post notices announcing that the mineswould continue working at lower rates of wage.This would take effect unless there was some post-ponement of the reduction from the 8-hours day tothe 7^-hours day in the districts where 7---hourswas not already in operation.    After giving a forecast of the probable attitude of the miners,the President of the Board of Trade stated thatthe Delegate Conference of the Miners&apos;  Federationwere meet in? on the morrow to consider the situa-tion, and the Secretary for Mines had taken theprecaution of sending them a letter telling them
that the Board would be appointed shortly..   Apartfrom the Government-s pledge and the attitude o^the Miners&apos;  Federation, he attached great import-ance to a transitional period during which a 7-^-hours day would be worked before the 7-hours daycame into operation next July.   The view of theCabinet Committee was that the Secretary for mines should be authorised to set up the national industrial Poard, in orde&quot;- that it might be readywithin the next two or three days to deal withany district dispute referred to it.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That a Cabinet Committee, composed as  follows -The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs ,The Secretary of State for 7ar,The Lord Privy Seal,The Secretary for Fines -should be set up immediately toassist the President o^ the Boardof Trade in dealing with the Coals situation:(b) That the President o^ the-Boardof Trade should be empowered toauthorise the Secretary for Vinesto set up a National IndustrialB oard immedi*? t ely .
AGE 0?up ring onreatmentgrsonsged iniierutes .viouserenc e:inet 15, Con-sion 1.)4. The Chancellor of the Exchequer brought to thenotice of the Cabinet the case- of an employee inPortsmouth Dockyard who,... during the moulders&apos;  strike of 1930,  in consequence of orders received from hisUnion, had refused to handle &quot;blackleg&quot; work.    Gn hisretirement this man&apos;s record had been reported as very good, with the solitary exception of his attitude in the moulders&apos;  strike.    But after thematter had been carefully considered by the admiralty and the Treasury it had been found impossible todo otherwise than to -make a reduction in his pension.Accordingly, two years had been deducted from hisestablished service for purposes of reckoning his pension, with the result that it had been reduced bya sum of ls.8d. a wreek..   The case had been taken upby the Amalgamat ed Engineering Union..The First Lord o^ the Admiralty, while personallyfavourable to a remission of the penalty in thisparticular case,., warned the Cabinet that,, if granted,a precedent would, be created which would almost certainly open the door to the review of other cases,probably affecting other Government Departments also,t o an extent which he was unable to estimate.    Itwas stated,, however, that the man in question, though he had refused to handle- &quot;blackleg&quot; work, had notgone on strike,  and,  in that event, it was suggestedthat it might be possible to differentiate this case..The Cabinet agreed   .That in the particular ease broughtto their attention by the Chancellorof the Exchequer the penalty shouldbe remitted, and should be retrospect-ive, but that every possible precautionshould be taken to avoid the adjustment in this particular case becoming a precedent of wider application.
5.   The Cabinet had before them the following documents relating  to the Trade Policy and thepresent Economic Situation of Great Britain:-The Report of the Committee ofEconomists of the economic advisory Council (C,P.-363 (30))-whioh had been before the cabinet at the Meeting mentioned, in the margin:A Memorandum by the Chancellorof the Duchy of LancastertC .P.-283 (30)):A Memorandum by the Lord privy seal ( C ,P .-293 ( 30)) .The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet thatthe Cabinet Committee appointed on September 19thto prepare a synopsis of the field covered by thethree Papers now before the Cabinet in a form whichcould be used, as an Agenda Paper, had had to post-pone its work owing to a delay of several weeks inthe completion of the Report of the Committee ofthe Economic Advisory Council,    By the time this latter Report had been received the Imperial Confer-ence was in full activity, and before the end ofthat Conference the Indian Round-Table conference had been opened.    In the circumstances it would beimpossible for him to undertake the work referredto the Cabinet Committee, and he therefore proposed the constitution of a new Committee.After a preliminary discussion on the Reportof the Committee of Economists of the economic advisory Council, the Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretary to the cabinet should circulate as soon as possiblethe Conclusions of the 9th Meetingof the Economic Advisory Council,held, on November 7, 1930, at whichthis Report had teen considered:
(b) That a Cabinet Committee, composed as follows -The Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;(In the Chair),The Secretary of State for War,The Lord Privy Seal,The President of the Board of Trade,The First Lord of the Admiralty, -should be set up (in replacement of the Cabinet Committee appointed on September 19th (Cabinet 54 (30),conclusion 5) to examine the threeReports referred to above, and moreparticularly any definite proposals contained therein, with a view tosubmitting a programme of action for consideration by the Cabinet:(o) That the Cabinet Committee should^if possible,  oommunicate to thePrime Minister a Report before december 11th, when the subject was to be considered further bythe Economic Advisory Council,and that any member of the cabinet who might have any suggestion tooffer should forward it to thePrime Minister before that date.
The Cabinet agreed  That a Cabinet Committee,  composed as follows -The Chancellor of the Exchequer(In the Chair),The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs,The Secretary of State for ;,&apos;ar.The Minister of Agriculture andFisheries,The President of the Board ofEducation,The President of the Board of Trade,The First Lord of the Admiralty -should be set up with instructionsto consider the preparatory work ofan economic character to be under-taken as the result of the ImperialConference, more particularly inconnection with the proposed EconomicConference at Ottawa;    to report tothe Cabinet from time to time on theprogress of its work;    and,  in thefirst Instance, to consider andreport as to what subjects requireinvestigation.    In carrying out this duty the Committee was asked not to overlook the importance of examining the position created in this  country by the Preferences accorded by theDominions, the extent to which thosePreferences are of value and are taken advantage of by the manufaturers-turers and traders of this country.In carrying out their terms ofreference the Committee was authorisedto interview manufacturers, traders,et c .
THE IMPERIALCONFERENCE,,1930 .(previous reference:Cabinet 68(30), Con-ol&quot;us ion 11.)7.    The Chanoellor of the Exchequer reportedto the Cabinet that, a question had arisen in regardto the precise significance of the term &quot;existing preferential margins&quot;, which, as stated in the summary of Proceedings of the Imperial Conference,1930^ His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom had agreed not to reduce for a period ofthree years or pending the outcome of the ottawa conference, subject to the rights of the UnitedKingdom Parliament to fix the Budget from year to year.    In some quarters it had been suggested thatthe phrase covered Safeguarding Duties.    He was quite clear in his own mind that this was not theintention.The other United Kingdom Delegates at therecent Imperial Conference supported the Chancellorof the Fx chequer in his recollection.The Cabinet agreed  To leave the question to be dealtwith by the Chancellor of theExchequer.2, Whitehall Gardens,  S,W.l,November 19, 19 30.
