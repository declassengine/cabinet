18 The Cabinet had before them the following documents in relation to Economic Policy at theImperial Conference, 1930:-A draft Statement on economic policy, prepared by the UnitedKingdom Delegation (C *P,-377 (30)):The Report of the Committee of theConference on Economic Co-operation(ECE,(30)  62) .The Prime Minister informed his colleagues that the political side of the Imperial conference was now practically complete.    It had not beenpossible to settle everything.   What was unsettledwould either not be mentioned in the Report or wouldbe refer-ed to as postponed or there would be abald statement saying that agreement had been impos-&apos;sible.   The attitude of the Irish Free StateDelegation had made progress very slowfflAs regards the Economic side, the Statementcontained in CP.-377 (30) had been drafted by theUnited Kingdom Delegates in accordance with theCabinet decisions.    It had been communicated tothe Prime Ministers and Heads of Delegations thesame day.   Though the reception had not been very favourable, it might be possible to get if accepted.As regards a Wheat Quota, however, thesituation in the Conference was very serious.The Delegates of the Dominions had adopted the line,first, that the Wheat Quota was a proposal of theUnited Kingdom G-oveminent, and, second, that theattitude of the United Kingdom representatives inthe discussions strengthened this assumption.They stated (and the Prime Minister expresslyexplained that this was not his own statement)that every difficulty that they themselves had
raised against the Quota had &quot;been answered by&quot;&quot; *United Kingdom Delegates or Officials.Other members of the United Kingdom Delega-tion supported the Prime Minister&apos;s statement, andit was pointed out that General Hertzog, whoseDominion is not much interested in the Wheat 0,-quota,had expressed the opinion in effect that the UnitedKingdom Delegation had been fooling the other Delegations and wasting their time in an investigationwhich from the first they never intended should result in action.The President of the Board of Trade,  as chairman of the Committee on Economic Co-operation,pointed out that from the very first the membersrepresenting the Australian and Canadian Delegationshad sought to fasten upon the United Kingdom Dele-gption the responsibility for proposing the WheatQ,quota and throughout the enquiry had never desisted^rom their efforts.   He himself had taken the utmostcare to comply with the Cabinet&apos;s decision and tomake clear that the United Kingdom Government wasnot committed to the proposal.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheriesexplained that, though not a member of the Committeeon EQonomic Co-operation, he had been invited toattend, and,  together with his Officials, had given all possible technical assistance.   He had,,however, throughout acted with the President gf thePoard of Trade in adopting a non-committal attitude.In the course of the discussion it transpired that the Australian and Canadian Delegates had atfirst been rather hostile to the principle of aWheat Quota, but,  as the result of a very searchingenquiry, during which many documents had been placed
at their disposal and a large number of UnitedKingdom Officials had been subjected to cross-examination, they had come to the conclusion thatit would be advantageous to their respectiveDominions.    It seemed probable that the veryextent of the facilities offered to there by theUnited Kingdom Government and Officials had tended to confirm their belief that it was  a UnitedKingdom proposal.Reference was made to the Minutes of the meetings of Heads of Delegations, from which itwas perfectly clear that on no occasion had anyUnited Kingdom Delegate committed himself to theprinciple of the Quota.   There appeared no room for doubt that the position of the Government hadbeen made clear from stage to stage.    The only&quot;proposal&quot; that had been a-,ade was a &quot;proposal&quot;that the subject should be examined.In the course of the discussion severalalternative proposals were made:- first, that, as pointed out by the President of the Board of Tradewhen the subject was first proposed at the Meetingof Heads of Delegations, and as hinted at in para-graph 3 of the Report of the Committee on economic co-operation, the subject of a Ojuota for Dominionwheat is politically inseparable from that of a quota for home-grown wheat:    that, as already statedto the Heads of Delegations by the Prime Minister, a quota for home-grown wheat had never been adopted bythe Cabinet:,   that the difficult question of the quota for home-grown wheat was now oorplicated bythe proposal for a quota for Dominion wheat:    andconsequently that the Government of the UnitedKingdom must reserve its right to the fullest
investigation before taking its decisions.Second, that the Prime Minister of theUnited Kingdom should emphasise that, while theReport on Economic Go-operation was very valuableas clarifying the producers1 point of view in theDominions,  a consideration to which the UnitedKingdom Government would give full weight, it didnot^ and could not,  deal with the question of its effect on the consumer in the United Kingdom:that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United kingdom could not express any opinion on the Quota until this aspect, as well as the application of thesystem, had been considered in detail.Third, that the Prime Minister of the UnitedKingdom should make a ruling from the Chair that thequestion was now one for His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United Kingdom to consider.It was stated that the Prime Minister ofCanada was considering the presentation of some form, of Resolution on the following day.The Cabinet agreed  -(a) To approve the Statement of PoliuyIn C .P .-377  ( 30) :(b) To leave the United Kingdom Dele-gates to adopt the line which they considered best, having regard tothe circumstances o^ the moment,for carrying out the Cabinefspolicy in regard to the proposedmeat Quota.&apos;
2. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that the Cabinet Committee, set up at theMeeting referred to in the margin, had met.    It hadbeen decided not to make any announcement at themoment in regard to the Committee&apos;s appointment.It had been agreed, however,  that an effort shouldbe made to meet Dr, *v e izn; a nn and other members  ofthe Zionist Committee,   Fis Committee had wished tohold this meeting during the present week, but had ascertained that there was a desire for a.representative of the United States Zionists to be present.    The whole matter had been in train for ameeting, with representatives  of the Zionists inthe following week.    On the previous evening,however, he had received a version of an allegedinterview with the Secretary of State for theColonies which had been published in the New YorkJewish newspaper &quot;Forward&quot;.   The result of this had been that representatives  of the Zionists had intimated to him that it would be impossible forthem to attend a meet in? of the Cabinet Committeeunless some explanatory statement could be issued..Otherwise they regarded It as certain that theirattendance at the Committee would only result insplitting the Zionist Movement.    T)r* Weizmann had suggested a formula for an announcement which theSecretary of State read to the Cabinet.    he himself, however, had said that he could not take any responsibility for their formula, but had undertaken to discuss the matter either with thePrime Minister or the Cabinet.    The Secretary ofState then read a formula for an announcement thathe himself had drawn up.
In the course o^ the discussion the Secretaryof State for the Colonies said that he had seen amember of the editorial staff of &quot;Forward&quot; privatelyand had talked freely with him,  on the distinctunderstanding that it was not an interview and thathis  own name was not. to be mentioned.    The allegedinterview,  therefore, was wholly unauthorised.A long discussion then took place in regardto the draft statement,  in the course of which reference was made to Questions to be asked in theHouse of Commons  on the following day *The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should consult the representatives of the ZionistGoirroittee as to whether they would accept an invitation to meet theCabinet Committee if the following statement were published:-&quot;Doubts havim been expressed as to the compatibility ofsome passages of the white paper of October 21st withcertain Articles of the PalestineMandat e, and other passageshaving proved liable to seriousmisunderstandings, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment will make a further statement concerning these matters and they have invited representa-tives of the Jewish Agency toconfer with some members ofitheCabinet on the subject. &quot;(nqtf: The amendments adopted by the Cabinet,as compared with the Foreign Secretary&apos;first draft, are underlined.)The Secretary of State agreed to try and induce the Zionists to acceptthe statement without the following words, which were in his first draft:-&quot;Pending promulgation of the intended statement no action will be taken on the points inquestion&quot; .(b) That  if agreement was reached on theabove Statement, he should issue itimroediat ely ,(c) That the answers to Questions to beasked in the House of Commons on the
following day should conformgenerally to the above Statement.(d) That the Lord Advocate should actas Legal Adviser to the . CabinetCommittee on Palestine.
3. The Secretary of State for India said hehad received a letter signed by Lord Reading andLord Peel asking for a meeting of the whole ofthe United Kingdom Delegates to the Indian Round-Table Conference,   They had pointed out that allthe other Delegations at the Conference were meetingtogether and that there could be no possibleobjection to such a meeting.The Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary of State forIndia,  in his reply,  should pointout that four out  o^ the fiveDelegates of the United FingdomGov ernment are fully occupied v.with the Imperial Conference, which itis desired to wind up before theIndian Conference is in full operation,  and that an immediatemeeting is difficult to arrange.lie would, however,  endeavour toarrange a meeting before the endof the present week.our-d.-Tg.bleon^erence  .previous reference:Cabinet 65(30), Oon-clusion 8.)
