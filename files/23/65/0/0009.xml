The Sub-Committee agreed with the Government of India that (a)    a^plainassertion of authority, and (b) material measuresto protect our territory, are required, and they considered that the construction of the proposedroads was a practical method of achieving these objects.      The alternative courses of actionput forward for the Cabinet&apos;s consideration were expressed in the following terms;-(a; to summon the Afridis and inform themcategorically that we intend to build these roadsin order:-(i)  to punish them for their misdeeds ofthe past six months by denying themaccess to the Khajuri plain., and thusdepriving them of their wintergrazing grounds;    and(ii) To prevent any recurrence of theirmisdeeds;(b) To summon the Afridis and inform them of our intention to build the road forthwith in language equally categorical, but less likely to provoke opposition.      They might, for example,be told that the roads are not intended as apunishment.for the past but a deterrent for thefuture, and that they would not be- used by us foraggressive action, unless this was demanded by their own misbehaviour.      In addition, it mightbe pointed out that the roads would be to theirown economic advantage if they acquiesced in,instead of obstructing, their construction;
