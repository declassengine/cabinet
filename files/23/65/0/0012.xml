The ambassador had asked for authority to thank the FrenchGovernment in suitable terms, and had submitted a number of proposals, of which the Secretary ofState gave particulars, as to Decorations, presentsto officials, etc., and to hospitals.   The treasury were willing to allot the sum of  500 in all forthes e purpose es .While some criticism was offered in regard tothe proposals for Honours and presents, theCabinet agreed  To authorise the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs, inconsultation with the british ambassador in Paris, to take&apos;appropriate steps both to thankthe French Government and to distribute rewards and presents.
THE LONDONUAVAL TREATY.rpfte Franco-Italianjjegot negotiations(previous oiisReference:Cabinet 43(gO), Con-elusion 2.,)2.    The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported to the Cabinet the receipt of a telegramfrom the British Ambassador at Washington (No.343)setting forth an urgent proposal from the UnitedStates Government for simultaneous representations on similar lines by the Governments of the UnitedKingdom, Japan and the United States of America,to the French and Italian Governments in regard to naval construction.   The occasion for this proposed action was the receipt by the United States Govern-ment of &quot;pretty reliable information&quot; that theFrench Government intended imminently to announce a building programme of three Battleships andanother 10,000-ton Cruiser, which would makeagreement with Italy still more difficult, and fromwhich, once announced, it would be difficult torecede.The proposal was that the three Naval powers should try to persuade the two Governments tobreak the present deadlock by each making a uni-lateral declaration that its programme during the lifetime of the Treaty would not exceed a level of&quot;X&quot; and. &quot;Y&quot; respectively.It was pointed out that the French appearedto have the right under the Treaty to constructthese ships, and that the three Governments concerned might expose themselves to a retort to this effect,although, of course, the French action was open tothe objection that they were building without previous agreement.The Cabinet agreed  To authorise the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs to associatein the action proposed if,after fuller examination, he deemedthis desirable.
OIL FUEL SUPPLYAND CONTROL.The Productionof Oil from coal.(previous reference:Cabinet 47(30)    Con-clusion 4.)3.

$EMPLOYMENT .(previous reference:Cabinet 59(SO), Con-elusion 12.)Public Works .Re-organisationof Industry.4. The discussion on Unemployment Insurance,for which the Cabinet had been called, was preceded by a discussion on the general question of Unem-ployment .The Chancellor of the Exchequer made a state-ment which gave rise to discussion on the followingpoints, among others:-PUBLIC WORKS.GOVERNMENT HELP IN RE-ORGANISING -INDUSTRY.THE STIMULATION OF WORK already decided ON TO RELIEVE UNEMPLOYMENT.EXPORT CREDITS TO RUSSIA.THE RESTORATION OF CONFIDENCE.In regard to public works- the cabinet recognised that the limit had almost been reachedof what could be done by co-operation with LocalAuthorities in relief works .   While it would be undesirable to state this publicly, or to. discour-ag e any schemes that might come forward, it was apoint that the Government would have to bearconstantly in mind.In regard to Government help in the re^-organisation of industry, reference was made tothe action already being taken to press forward on the lines of the Cotton and Coal Reports of theEconomic Advisory Council Committees.   The need was emphasised for finding credit for industry insuch matters as the urgently needed increase inthe size of coal tips at ports, and colliery screens,which were holding up the policy of substitutingthe 20-ton for the 10-ton truck.   One suggestion was that some new organisation was requiredbeyond the ordinary Departmental machinery forsuch purposes.   In this connection attention

NeitherParliament nor public opinion -was likely to besatisfied merely with the appointment of a royal Commission to enquire into these matters.The Cabinet agreed --To refer to the Panel of ministers the proposals set forth inparagraph 16 of CP. 318(30).
