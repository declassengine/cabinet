,flOTf1RIC TJLT URALPOLICY.!/previous reference:Cabinet 62(30),  Oon-Oli:sion 3.)quota for home-grown,vheat.(previous refer enc e:Cabinet 67(30), Con-conclusion 1.)1.    The Prime Minister informed his  colleagues that he was being  subjected to a good deal of pressure as to what steps the Government intendedto take to give effect to the statement made by theChancellor of the Exchequer on behal^ of the Cabinetjust before the prorogation of Parliament^Cabinet 48 (30), Conclusion 1).    It was represented by the government&apos;s supporters that it was difficultto discuss Agricultural Policy in the constituenciesuntil a decision had been reached on such matters asa quota for home-grown wheat and unemployment insur-ance for agricultural workers.    This latter question^he pointed out, would be considered by the RoyalCommission on Unemployment Insurance.   He drew attention to the following passage in the Chancellorof the Exchequer^ statement:-&quot;but as soon as the conclusions of theImperial Conference are known, theGovernment will undertake whateverpracticable steps can be devised toput cereal-growing in this country on an economic foundation&quot;*At that time it had been anticipated that theImperial Conference would be able to deal finallywith the question o^ a wheat quota, but in the event the settlement of this question had been left over until the Ottawa Conference.In the course of the discussion it was pointedout that. the. question of a quota for home-grown wlheatcould be settled quite independently of a quota for wheat grown in the Dominions,    It was also pointedout that, apart from the question of a Wheat Quota,,a number of additional matters ought to be carefully considered with a view to ensuring success for theGovernmentTs Agricultural Policy.   In this connection it was recalled that the question of home-grown bacon
v;as now under consideration &quot;by tire Chancellor ofthe Exchequer&apos;s Trade Policy Committ ee .    Dumping wasalso referred to as a matter of great public interest the President of the Board of Trade informed theCabinet that he had in course of preparation a,verycomplete Memorandum in regard to the question ofdumping, which he hoped to circulate within the nextfew days.It was suggested that, in addition, the economic advisory Council might perhaps be pursuing  enquiries which might bear on the Government*s agricultural policy,  and that information had probably been collected, by various Government Departments,   Thefirst task in any Inquiry on the subject,  therefore,,would be to gather together the facts as to theextent and nature of enquiries already in progress which bore on the question.The Cabinet agreed - That a Committee,  composed asfollows -The Home Secretary,The Lord Privy Seal,The Minister of Agriculture andFisheries,The President       the Board of Trade--,,The Secretary of State for Scotland -should meet to formulate,   forconsideration by the Cabinet-j  apolicy for carrying out the state-ment made by the Chancellor of theExchequer in the House of commons on August 1st...(NOTE: The Prime Minister instructed theSecretary to the Cabinet to take steps to ascertain the facts as tothe enquiries which are in progress,whether by Cabinet Committees,  orby the Economic Advisory Council,or in Departments, which have a bearing on the Committee&apos;s Termsof Reference, and to report themto the Committee before their first meeting .)

Attachedto the Memorandum was a Liberal note on Amendment tothe Bill, the substance of which was that an agri-cultural worker should be placed in the same positionas an unemployed person with regard to applicationsfor and provision of small holdings.In the course of the discussion it was statedthat unemployed agricultural workers were eligiblefor small-holdings .    The suggestion was made thatthe proper course was to select for small-holdingsonly persons who are on the unemployment registerand to make provision for this in the Bill.The Cabinet agreed -That the Small-holdings part oftheir Agricultural Policy hadbeen devised in the interestsof the unemployed; and that  theMinister of Agriculture andFisheries, in dealing with thematter in the parliamentary committee, should adhere to this attitude and should emphasise thefact that unemployed agricultural workers are eligible for Small-holdings .

The.authority of the Cabinet was there-fore asked by the two Secretaries of State to informthe Leaders of the Conservative and Liberal Partiesthat they are now engaged in consideration of thewhole problem;    that they would like to study it incons til tat ion with them;    and that it is hoped thatthey win feel able to nominate responsible membersof their Parties to go into the problem with theGovernment as soon as the latter are in a position tovut before them all the facts and the relevant considerations.The Cabinet approved the proposalsof the Secretaries of State for theDominions and the Colonies,, as setforth above,  and authorised them to conduct negotiations with theLeaders of the Conservative and LiberalParties, and to report further tothe Cabinet on the subject.

EDUCATION.The Voluntary-School Problem.(previouskeference:G. hi net pp\:,Q, ,  Oon-conclusion 1 ,  and cabinet ?Jj(;0;, con-clusi on 7)*9-    In connection with trie item on theAgenda referred to in the previous Minute,  thePresident of the Board of Education informed hiscolLSa^colleagues   that he had been carrying on further negotiations on the question of voluntary schools, and had now reached a point at whichhe thought it his duty to report to theCabinet.      lie was now in a position, he thought,to make an agreement which would be acceptedby the Roman Catholic hierarchy, end, he feltequally sure, by the representatives of theChurch of England,  and would not be rejected by the Ron-Conformist churches.      The natterwas  of considerable urgency,  since he had reason to believe that unless he could makea statement in regard no the voluntary schoolsit would be difficult to secure the passageof the Education (School Attendance) Bill.The Cabinet were unwilling to come toany decision on this question until they had-before them the details of the arrangements proposed by the President of the Board ofEducation.      It transpired , however,  thatlate&apos;   on the previous evening, arrangements had been made whereby the Report Stage of theEducation (School Attendance; Bill would betaken on the following Wednesday afternoon,and the Third Reading on Thursday nea:t week..This,  it was recognised, would enable the-puestion to be considered by the Cabinet at
their next weekly meeting.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the President of the Boardof Education should,  as soon aspossible,  circulate to the cabinet particulars of his proposals inregard to the Voluntary Schools,and an account of the negotiations with had led to the presentposi tion;(b) That the question should beplaced early on the Agenda paper for  the next weekly meetingof the Cabinet.(NOTE:-    Por a statement made during theabove discussion,  in regard to parliamentary Business, see   -Conclusion 17)&apos;
BETTING, GAMING 10. Tlie Cabinet had before then, a Memorandum byAND LOTTERIES.the Home Secretary f CP,-413 (30)) in regard to(Previous sweepstakes promoted in the Irish Free State.    InRef erence:Cabinet 2 this Memorandum it was stated that the law was(29),  C on-clusion 10.)        clear that all public lotteries are unlawful andthat the sweepstakes under consideration, which areSweepstakesin the Irish       promoted from Dublin on racing In this  country, are free State.undisguised public lotteries.    Those responsiblefor the enforcement of the law, therefore, would be bound to take action,  and it would be the Home -Secretary&apos;s duty to co-ordinate the action of thevarious authorities concerned.   He expressed thehope that the Secretary of State for Dominion affairs would make suitable representations to the IrishFree State Government in regard to the illegality ofthe sweepstakes in the United Kingdom.   In view,however,  of the existence of a considerable bodyof opinion in favour of the law being changed so asto permit lotteries to be carried out, under proper safeguards and as a method of raising money fordeserving objects, the Home Secretary proposed, whenexplaining in the House of Go: irons the steps to betaken to enforce the existing law,  to make clear at the same time that the Government, without committing themselves to any final vie?&quot; on thequestion of principle involved, would be prepared,if a request were made to them on behalf of anysubstantial group of existing  charities, to set upa Committee to consider as a practical question theconditions and safeguards which would be appropriate and necessary If lotteries were to be permitted as a method of raising money for approved public purposes.
The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs , while not refusing to approach theIrish Free State Government on the question,pointed out that that Government was likely toask what action was being taken in regard tosweepstakes organised in foreign countries whichare widely advertised in the United kingdom.The Cabinet agreed in principle to the Home Secretary&apos;s proposal that the existing law should be reviewed, and invited the HoneSecretary to make suggestions asto the form that that review should take.
cabinet procedure.(previous reference:Cabinet 31(50) ,  Con-clusion 12V11.      The Prime Minister drew the attention of-his colleagues to the growing habit of circulatingmemoranda, often long and bearing on controversialquestions,  immediately before the meeting of theCabinet.      He pointed out that this did notfacilitate the transaction of Cabinet business,since Members were unable to acquaint themselves with the contents of the memoranda before the meetings.
PRIVATE 12.      The Prime Minister,  referring to hisMEMBERS&apos; ILLS. remarks at the previous meeting of the Cabinet,summarised in the Conclusion mentioned in(PreviousRofo-ronco; the margin, urged that his colleagues should be.Cabinet 71&apos;p0), Con- extremely careful in their attitude towards Privateelusion M\.)Members&apos;  Bills,  and should impress  the saneattitude upon Government Speakers representingtheir Departments.      On a recent occasion a speaker for the Government had announced thatthe Government Intended to allow a free vote ona Private Member&apos;s Bill.      This was not a properattitude, as time allotted to Private Memberswas not Government time,  and the Government hadno right to intervene except when,  in the -interest of Parliamentary Business,  it wasnecessary to communicate information inregard to a Bill. .i-17-
