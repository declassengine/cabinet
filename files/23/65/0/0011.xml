1. The Prime Minister offered a very heartywelcome to Lord Amulree, whose appointment as secretary of State for Air had been announcedthat morning.
THE KING-&apos; SSPEECH.(previous reference:Cabinet 58.(30), Con-elusion 3*)2,   The Prime Minister informed his colleagues that most of the material for the KingTs Speechhad now been received and was being put together in the form of a first preliminary draft.    On his suggestion the Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Lord Chancellor shouldedit the draft of the King*sSpeech on the Opening of Parlia-ment, for consideration by theCabinet at an early date:(b) That the Speech should be couched in the briefest possible terms.
3.    The Secretary of State for India, referring to the decision of the Cabinet mentioned in the margin,  to the effect that the announcement ofthe arrangements for the Opening Meeting of theIndian Round Table Conference should be includedin the King&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament,stated that there were practical difficulties inpostponing the announcement.    He added that theViceroy took the same view as himself, that anannouncement of the King&apos;s intention to open theConference was calculated to produce a goodpolitical effect.    In this event it was important that the Royal Gallery at the House of lords should,  if possible, be made available, not only from the point of view of the dignity of theopening proceedings,  but also from that of the publicity arrangements.    The date at present contemplated was about November ISth.The Prime Minister said that he had been warned that it was by no means unlikely that theImperial Conference might be just coming to anend about the date mentioned,  and that it was by no means impossible that the work of theConference might have reached a stage requiringheavy demands on the time of its members.The Secretary of State for India suggestedthat the exact date might be subject to finaladjustment.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretary of State forIndia should be authorised to approach the King officiallywith a view to ascertaining HisMajesty&apos;s pleasure in regard tothe opening of the Conference:(b) That, subject to the King1s assent,an announcement should, be made ofHis Majesty&apos;s intention to open the Conference:
(e) That the Secretary of State forIndia should also be authorisedto approach the proper authori-ties for permission to use theRoyal Gallery in the House ofLords for the Opening of theIndian Round-Table Conference:(d) That the Pirat Meeting of theIndian Round-Table Conference,though not definitely fixed,should be as near November 12thas possible.-4-
INDIAN ROUND-TABLE CON-FERENCE.Procedure ofthe UnitedKingdomDelegation.(previous reference:Cabinet 46(30)* Con-relusion 5(b).,)4. The Secretary of State for India asked foran early meeting of the United Kingdom delegates at the Indian Round-Table Conference.   He recalled that the Cabinet decision referred to in the marginhad contemplated that one or more other ministers should be selected for each Meeting according tothe subject of discussion.   He thought it wouldbe useful if the Parliamentary Under-Secretary,India Office, and the Postmaster-General couldattend the above meeting of Ministers.The Prime Minister said that he was anxious that the arrangements for the United kingdom delegation at the Indian Round-Table conference should follow the general lines adopted in thecase of the Imperial Conference.   He recalled thatthe Policy Committee had met both before theConference, for preparatory work, and during theConference.The Cabinet agreed  That an early meeting of the UnitedKingdom Delegates should take place,to which should be invited, in addi-tion, the Under-Secretary, IndiaOffice, and the Postmaster-General.
(previous refer enc e:Cabinet 59(30), Con-elusion 5.)5.    Some further discussion took place inregard to the successor to the present viceroy of India, a subject which had been discussed atthe previous Meeting of the Cabinet mentioned inthe margin.It was agreed  That the question should befurther examined by a CabinetCommittee composed as follows:-The Prime Minister,The Secretary of State forForeign Affairs,The Secretary of State for India,The First Commissioner of Works,-the Committee to meet as soon aspossible and to report at the next meeting of the Cabinet.Appointmentof Viceroy.
6. The cabinet.net had before them a Memorandum bythe Attorney-General (CP .-32 3 (30))  coveringalternative re-drafts of the Statute of Westminster,(i) for the purpose of including inthe Statute a statement of theright of the United Kingdom to admit to Dominion status suchterritory as seems proper toher without obtaining the con-sent o^ the other Dominions,and(ii) for the purpose of securing, sofar ao possible, that India&apos;claim to become a Dominion shouldnot be prejudiced, but without raising in express terms the otherissue.In his covering Memorandum the Attorney-Generalexplained that the amendments he had. suggested,though they go a long way towards meeting theIndian objection, yet require   to be supplementedfurther.   He had therefore drafted the followingResolution, which he suggested the Imperial Con-ference might be asked to adopt:-&quot;In the event of the like autonomyas is now enjoyed by the Self-GoverningDominions being, hereafter granted bythe appropriate legislature to any territory under Plis Majesty&apos;s rule,each of the several members of theBritish Commonwealth will be pre-pared to consider favourably the recognition of that territory aspossessing the status described inthe Report of the Imperial Confer-ence 6* 1926&quot; .The Prime Minister informed his colleagues that as the result of the deliberations at theImperial Conference he was hopeful of obtaining a recommendation more favourable to the generalpolicy of the Government than at one time had appeared probable.The cabinet agreed -That, in view of the present stateof the deliberations at the Imperial
Conference, it was unnecessaryat present to take any decision in regard to the Attorney-GeneralMem o ran dum ( C . P.- 32 3 ( 30)) .-8-
EMPIREMIGRATION.(previous reference:Cabinet 2(30), Con-clusion 4&apos;7.The Cabinet had before them the following documents on the subject of Empire Migration:-The Report of a Committee of theEconomic Advisory Council (CP.-329 (30)), the Conclusions andRecommendations of which are summarised at the end of theReport:A Memorandum circulated by theSecretary of State for DominionAffairs (CP.-343 (30)), the termsof which had been agreed betweenthe Dominions Office, the treasury and the Ministry of Labour,containing suggestions as to thepolicy to be pursued by HisMajesty*s Government in theUnited Kingdom in regard toEmpire Migration at the ImperialConference.The Prime Minister referred to an informalexchange of views he had had with the PrimeMinister of Canada which it was possible might lead to developments in the matter of migrationto Canada.   At the moment, however, the matter was not ripe for official consideration.The Minister of Labour drew attention to para-graph 16 of the Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs, which recommended thatthe United Kingdom Government should not be defi-nitely committed to action, as suggested in theReport of the Committee of the Economic AdvisoryCouncil, for the extension of the provision of reduced ocean passage rates for bona fide migrantswith a view to encouraging persons to migrate attheir own expense and for placing greater reliance on selected voluntary Societies.   Miss Bondfieldsaid that the Ministry of Labour attached import-ance to this provision.
The Prime Minister said that was a matter which would have to await examination by theTreasury.The Cabinet agreed -To approve the Memorandum bythe Secretary of State forDominion Affairs (C.P.-343(30)) as a guide for theUnited Kingdom Delegation atthe Imperial Conference andthe relevant Committee thereof.
STATUS OPDOMINIONHIGH COMMIS-SIONERS.(previous references:Cabinet 58(28), Con-elusion 7andCabinet 51(30), Con-clusion 1.)8. The Cabinet had before them a Note bythe Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs(CP.-338 (30)) covering a draft Memorandum forthe Imperial Conference on the subject of theStatus of Dominion High Commissionersf conceivedon the lines of C.P.-298 (30), paragraph 9,which had been before the Cabinet at their meeting on September 17, 1930.    In this memorandum it was stated that His Majesty&apos;s Government inthe United Kingdom are prepared to recommend toHis Majesty that Dominion High commisioners should on all occasions (other than thoseoccasions when Ministers of the Crown from theDominions are present) rank immediately afterSecretaries of State, i.e., before all otherCabinet Ministers in the United Kingdom, except those who already have higher precedence thanSecretaries of State.   In his covering Note theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs proposedthat, if the Cabinet approved in general theterms of the Memorandum, he should submit itinformally to the King and, if His majesty should approve the suggestion made, circulate itto the Imperial Conference.The Prime Minister recalled that theproposals set forth in the Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs hadbeen considered by the Policy Committee andhad been included in the Secretary of State&apos;sMemorandum regarding the Imperial Conference, 1930Agenda (CP.-298 (30), paragraph 9).While the proposals of the Secretary ofState did not pass without critiei^m^HtheCabinet agreed to accept them.
SINGAPORE... 9. The Cabinet had before them a Report bythe Fighting Services Committee (C.P.-344 (30))(previous reference:- covering a Memorandum by the Chancellor of theCabinet 57(30), Con- Exchequer, in which the question of Singaporeelusion 5.) &quot;is examined from the point of view of the UnitedKingdom Exchequer.The recommendation of the Committee was thatthe United Kingdom Delegation should advocate the following policy at the Imperial ConferenceSub-Committee on Singapore, \vhich is to meet inthe near future:-(a) That no change should be madein the present policy of ulti-mately establishing a defendednaval base at Singapore.(b) That the Jackson Contract shouldbe continued, but that apart fromthis and such expenditure as isnecessary for the completion ofthe air base on the scale atpresent contemplated, theremaining expenditure requiredfor completing the equipment ofthe docks and for defence works should be postponed for the next five years.   The precise scale ofthat expenditure should then bedetermined in the light of theresults of the next Naval Gonfer-ence.The Committee also agreed that it should bemade clear to the representatives of theDominions that the continuance of the presentslowing-down policy would not prevent full effect being given to the complete scheme for the base when this is considered necessary.The Secretary of State for the Coloniesdrew attention to telegrams from the governors of the Straits Settlements and Hong-Kong, whichhad been circulated to the Cabinet.   The opinionof the Governor of the Straits Settlements wad&apos;that a fully protected Naval Base as planned-IS-
would be both a safeguard and a valuable assetto Malaya, but that an unprotected or inadequatelyprotected Naval Ease would be a great danger to malaya, as an invitation to attack:    the slowing-down process would prolong the period during whichthe Naval Base was a potential source of dangerrather than a protection.   The view of the governor of Hong-Kong was that the completion and fullprotection of the Base at Singapore was essentialto the defence of Hong-Kong in the event of war.He asked that due consideration might be givento these vieus of the question as regarded from a strategic standpoint, and asked also that carefulconsideration should be given by the FightingServices Committee, when they met the representa-tives of Australia and New Zealand as arranged,to a Memorandum on the position of the Malayanand Hong-Kong Governments which he was about to circulate (CP.-334 (30)).The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the recommendationsof the Fighting Services committee as set forth in CP.-344 (.30) andquoted above, and to authorise theUnited Kingdom Delegates at theImperial Conference to use it asa basis for their negotiations:(b) To draw the attention of theUnited Kingdom Delegates to aMemorandum by the Secretary-ofState for the Colonies (CP.-334(30)) .
RENEWAL OPARBITRATIONTREATIES.BelligerentRights at sea.(previous refer ene e:Cabinet 57(SO), Con-elusion 9 .)10. The Cabinet had before them the following documents relating to the renewal of ArbitrationTreaties with the United States of America,raising the issue of belligerent rights at sea:-A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs(CP .-335 (30)) which was orig-inally prepared for the use ofthe Imperial Conference but hadnot yet been circulated.    Inthis Memorandum it was suggestedthat, while it would be prefer-able to leave the question ofthe new Anglo-United StatesTreaty alone, it would be unde-sirsbleto avoid discussing itat the forthcoming ImperialConference.   Consequently itwas suggested to make no moveuntil the United States Govern-ment again sought to learn our attitude towards their draft treaty, when we should suggestthat they should sign the optional clause.    If this proposal was rejected we should agree to accept their draft with any alterations in form required to meet thepresent Constitutional positionof the Dominions, and with an amendment in the sense that they themselves have suggested toprovide for the compromis being agreed to by the entities of theBritish Commonwealth &quot;in accord-ance with their Constitutions&quot;.of such a draft amend-suggested in the Memo-It was further suggestedthat provision should be made, onthe lines of the last paragraphof Article 2 of the Root-BryceTreaty of 1908, to the effectthat agreements relating to the&quot;compromis &quot;shall be binding only when confirmed by the two Governmentsby an exchange of notes&quot;.   Attachedto the Secretary of State&apos;s Memorandumwere a number of documents, includingthe Report of a Sub-Committee ofthe Committee of Imperial defence which considered this question under the late Government:The termsment wererandum.A Note by the First Lord of theAdmiralty (C.P.-331 (30)) covering the views of the Admiralty, whichit had not been found possible to reconcile with those of the ForeignOffice,.   The Admiralty urged thatthe question of belligerent rights at sea should be definitely
reserved from a compulsory arbitration Treaty, and requested that a statement oftheir views should be placed before the Cabinet and also the delegates at the Imperial Con-ference.    In this Memorandum itwas stated, inter alia, that theNaval Staff feel very strongly that by acceding to the proposed treaty of Arbitration with theUnited States of America withouta reservation in regard tobelligerent rights we should bevoluntarily surrendering one ofour greatest v;weapons in time ofwar and one of the greatest safe-guards against another Powerdeclaring war against us, as other powers dread the exercise in full of naval belligerent rights.   TheNaval Staff expressed the viewthat if the present draft wererelentlessly pressed they would prefer to exclude belligerentrights from arbitration,  even atthe risk of a Conference beingsummoned to consider the questionof belligerent rights.    Emphasiswas laid on the point that thedecision arising out of an appealto the Arbitration Court in a minor war might result in deprivingus for all time of some belligerentright which would be important in a most momentous war:A Memorandum by the Secretary ofStat e for Dominion Affairs(C.P.-337 (30)) covering a Note onthe Memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs, inwhich the probable attitude of thevarious Dominions was summarised:A further Note by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs (CP.-342(30)) covering a Memorandum by theForeign Office commenting on theAdmiralty Memorandum;    indicating that the Foreign Office is asanxious as the Admiralty to preserve belligerent rights tothe fullest possible extent,, sinceaction under Article XVI of theCovenant involves their employment;that, owing to the development of american opinion, the longer thequestion can be allowed to sleepthe better from our point of view;strongly deprecating the idea ofa Conference in Washington on thesubject, and reaching the conclu-sion that the balance of advantagelies on the side of not attempting to exclude belligerent rights fromthe Treaty.    It was added that every effort should be made to
avoid getting into a position,where the choice has to be made,and it was suggested that thepossibility should be exploredof substituting for the Arbitra-tion Treaty proposed by Mr Kellogga Treaty providing for improvedmethods of settlement of disputesby conciliation,  etc., a referenceto judicial settlement being retained for cases where both sides agreethat such a method would be themost appropriate.   A discussionwith the Dominions was againadvocated.Attention was drawn in the course of the discus-sion to the proposal in the last-named Paper that means might be found for providing for improved-methods for the settlement of disputes by concilia-tion, etc., reserving judicial settlement only to cases where both sides agreed that such a method would be the most appropriate.The Prime Minister recalled that in.a cpnversa-tion with President Hoover the latter had expressedno resentment at the delay in regard to the Arbi-tration Treaty and had suggested that it was amatter that might perhaps be settled in a betterway.   He himself felt it would have a great effecton the world if our relations with the United Statesof America could be expressed in a document of adifferent type from the old Arbitration Treaty.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the question of the renewal of the Arbitration Treaty shouldbe kept back,so far as possible,from the Imperial Conferenceuntil the Cabinet had decided ona policy:(b) That the question should be con-sidered by a Cabinet committee composed as follows:-The Prime Minister (if able to attend)The Secretary of St?fc e for ForeignAffairs,The Lord President of the Council,The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs,The First Lord of the Admiralty.-16-
REDUCTION and limitation of armaments.Draft Dis-armam entConvention.budgetary limitation andHors e-PowerLimitation for aircraft.(previous reference:Cabinet 58(27), Con-elusion 3.)11 The Cabinet had before them the following documents relating to a draft Disarmament Conven-tion:-A Note by the Secretary (O.P.-336 (30)) covering the following documents of the Committee ofImperial Defence:-A Report by a Sub-Committee onthe Reduction and Limitation ofArmaments (C.I.D.

&apos;  A Note by the Chief of the AirStaff (CP.-339 (30) ) circulated   &apos;by direction of the Prime Minister,on the Policy of Budgetary Limita-tion,prepared in accordance withthe instructions and notes left bythe late Secretary of State for Air.In this Note it was stated that theAir Ministry are fully in favour ofthe principle of limitation of arma-ments, but hold that direct limitationof material by enumeration plus as .full a measure of budgetary publicityas can be attained,represents theonly practical line of approach toan actual international agreement.They are convinced that if anattempt is made to superimposeindirect Budgetary Limitation theonly result will be gravely to prejudice the prospect of inter-national agreement and to hinderthe progress of disarmament.Reasons for this vie^ were given.A Memorandum by the Chief of theAir Staff (CP. -340 (30)),circulatedby direction of the Prime Minister,  .prepared in accordance with theinstructions and notes left bythe late Secretary of State forAir,setting forth the technical reasons why,  in their view,  ahorse-power limitation is ineffect-ive and impracticablo.    attached tothe Memorandum was a second Memo-randum which the late Secretaryof State for Air had approved forthe guidance of the British dele-gates to the Preparatory Commissionon Disarmament,to the same effect.The Prime Minister said he had received a request from the Air Ministry that this question might be postponed as the Department had not had time to submit their views to the new secretary the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs pointed out that the question was one of great urgency,  o?/ing to the early meeting of thePreparatory Commission.jxfter discussion, the Cabinet agreed --(a) To approve the principle of budgetary limitation,and,subject to this, to approvegenerally the Report of theSub-Committee on the Reduction
and Limitation of Armaments(C,I.D. Paper No. 10I6-B)attached to CP.-356 (30);(h) That, as recommended by theCommittee of Imperial Defence,a Committee, composed of -The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs,The Secretary of State for War,The Secretary of State for Air,The First Lord of the Admiralty,A Representative of the Treasury,with power to co-opt such experts asthey may think fit, should meet withthe following terms of reference:-(i) To examine and report to theCabinet regarding the prac-tical details of the applica-tion of the principle of budgetary limitation to thethree Fighting Services insuch manner as will safeguardnational interests:(ii) To recommend to the Cabinetthe best method of dealingwith the Air Ministry&apos;difficulties regarding limit-ation by horse-power.
12.The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Minister of Labour (CP.-318 (30)). onthe subject of Unemployment Insurance, theConclusions of which were summed up in the lastparag raph as f o 1 lows : -Subject to consideration of reduced benefits or increased contributions,  I see no wayof avoiding  (l) A further increase of  20,000,000in the borrowing powers of theUnemployment Fund, making atotal of  80,000,000.(2) A further extension of &quot;transi-tional benefit&quot; at heavy costto the Exchequer.We should probably set up immediately  (3) A Royal Commission to review thewhole field of unemploymentinsurance and the other arrange-ments for assisting the able-bodied unemployed.Pending the report of the RoyalCommission  (4) We must decide whether to dealat once with alleged &quot;abuses&quot;,and specially with  (a) Seasonal Workers;(b) Short-time Workers,(c) Married Women;(d) Transitional benefit incases where no hardshipwould be oreated by with-holding it.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, after pointing out that none of the above recommendations made any appreciable, reduction in the cost of theInsurance Fund, made a report to his colleagues on the present and prospective financial situation^impressing on them the vital need of avoidingincreased expenditure either in the current orthe coming financial year.As the time remaining for the Cabinet was not1 sufficient to enable the discussion to be completed,it was agreed
