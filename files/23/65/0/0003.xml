I ICULK PURCHASE?0p DOMINIONBpRODUOB.ilmport Boards .:(Pr eviousj Reference:I Cabinet 51I (SO),  Con-1 elusion 2.)IMPERIAL TRADES POLICY ANDI IMPERIAL BOON-lOMlC MACHINERY&quot;.1. The Cabinet resumed the consideration,begun on the same morning, of the questions ofBulk Purchase of Dominion Produce and ImportBoards..   As the discussion proceeded it broadenedout to include the more general subjects ofImperial Trade Policy and Imperial EconomicWachinery, which are discussed in a Memorandumby the President of the Board of Trade covering a brief prepared by the Inte&quot;--Departmental Committeeon Economic Questions  (CeP.-304 (30)) and theReport of the Committee on Empire Trade, 1930,  ofthe &quot;Economic Advisory Council (C.P.-22C! (30)).Pursuing the subject of an Import Board,  and taking up the questions propounded by the Chancellorof the Exchequer in C^-oOS (30),  the cabinet agreed that, if created,  an Import Eoard would beof the nature of a statutory body and not a department of Government controlled, by the Cabinet.or by the Head of a Department of the Government.In regard to the third group of questions propoundedby the Chancellor of the Exchequer,  namely, as towhat would be the effect of an Import Board on imperial relations, the trend of opinion was tothe effect that friction would be difficult to avoid,Moreover,  it was realised that it wo v. Id be as diffi-cult for the Dominions to offer a secured market for the manufactures of the Mother Country, without detriment to their v;orld trade, as it woi Id be forth   United Kingdom to purchase their, requirements from the Dominions to the detriment of trade withforeigny countries such as,  for example, the Argentine.
The Prime Minister summed up the discussion by stating that while, theoretically,  there was agreat deal to be said for an Import Board,  it wouldin ^act be extremely difficult to establish it ona full-sized scale.    It would, therefore,  be better to start with something which might develop laterinto an Import Board.The Cabinet felt that until the australian government, at whose instance this question hadbeen placed on the Agenda Paper, had developedits proposals in detail, it was impossible for themto reach any final decisions,  and that the utmostthat could be done was to formulate,  in relation tothe Imperial Conference,  the essentials of theUnited Kingdom in regard to Import Boards.In the circumstances the Cabinet felt that better prospects of progress were opened up bysome of the suggestions contained in the Memorandumby the President of the Board of Trade on ImperialTrade Policy and Imperial Economic Machinery(C .P. 504 (30)).    It was suggested that vhat was required was to establish machinery for a morecontinuous study of Empire trade.    In the politicalsphere this .might be achieved by meetings, to be heldin london or elsewhere as might be arranged,  inconnection with the annual visits of Empire repre-sentatives to the Assembly of the League at Geneva.To facilitate the preparation for such meetings,the establishment of som,e form of ImperialSecretariat,  analogous to the economic side of theLeague of Nations Secretariat, was deemed desirable.Such a Secretariat,  it was thought, might &quot;&apos;orm aoonnectin-v  link between such existing bodies as
the Imperial Shipping Committee,  the ImperialEconomic Committee,  the Empire Marketing Boardand the Imperial Institute.    The existence ofthe Secretariat would make it easier for allconcerned to follow the work of these separateImperial bodies.    In addition, suggested meetings between unofficial organisations were consideredusefulo    It was further suggested that progressmight be made along the line of agreements betweenthe United Kingdom and separate Dominions,  on the analogy of the Anglo-Argentine Agreement.&apos;    thatis to say,  in the nature of a guaranteed reoipro-city for interchange of trade.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That,  as soon as possible, thePresident of the Board of trade should submit to the Cabinetdefinite proposals on the linesof the suggestions in C.P.-304(30) and of the above summary;    and,if he deemed necessary, he shouldrecall Sir Sydney Chapman from geneva to assist in this work:(b) That,  in view of the probability of the question of Import Boardsbeing raised at the ImperialConference, the President of theBoard of Trade should also formulate,on the basis of the Cabinet&apos;s dis-cuss ion, the requirements of HisMajestyJs Government in the UnitedKingdom for any Import Board thatmight be established, the first ofsuch requirements being that theBoard must be established primarily in the interests o^ the people-o^the United Kingdom,, wfegrefo woul-drs3J&amp;&amp;ft-*^etrte^frie Board would be free to purchase in any part of theworld.
IMPERIALCONFERENCE,19 30 .PossibleWhite Paper2. The Prime Minister asked his colleagues toconsider whether there would be any advantage in publishing as a White Paper any of the materialprepared in connection with the Imperial Confer-once.    In particular, he suggested that it might perhaps be useful to publish in a convenient formsome of the statistics of exports and importsbearing on the question of an Import Eoard.    Thiswould include statistics of exports and imports to and from countries like the Argentine, as wellas those to and from, the Dominions.The Secretary was instructedto place the subject on theAgenda of an early Meeting  ofthe Cabinet.
PUBLICATION 3. The Chancellor of the Exchequer informedOP INFORMA-T-IOI? BEARING the Cabinet that the President of the Board of on THE FISCALCONTROVERSYo Trade was preparing a revision of the statistical information that had been issued by Mr Balfour&apos;sGovernment in the early part of the Century inconnection with the fiscal, controversy of that day .
