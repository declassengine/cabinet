REDUCTION AND 1.    The attention cf the Cabinet was drawnLIMITATION OFABMAMENTS. by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs toa telegram (See Appendix I A) from Lord Cecil(previous reference: at Geneva in which Lord Cecil asked for cabinet 66(30)Conclusion 5.)      instructions at the earliest possible moment withregard to the attitude which he should adopt towards Article I.B. of the Draft disarmament convention proposed by the Netherlands Government.In this connection the Cabinet were informed that a special Sub-Committee of the.Committee of Imperial Defence had considered LordCecil&apos;s request and had prepared a report  (paper cp.  398  (30)) the conclusions of which represented, however, the views only of the three fighting Services.The Cabinet were informed that,   in theopinion of the Foreign Office, a very badimpression would be created if Great Britainresisted the proposal of the netherlands government and,   in this connection,  special attention was drawn to the terms of Article 8of the Oovenant of the League of Nations and toLord Cecil&apos;s view that if Great Britain opposed the draft she would find herself in acuteopposition to the United States and otherRations favourable to the policy of Disarmament.On the other hand the attention of theCabinet was drawn to the conclusions on page 5 ofthe annexure to Paper CP.  3S8 (50) reached bythe Representatives of the Service Departments onthe Special Sub-Committee.    In particular it was urged that the disclosure of the grave deficiency in the reserves of war material held by the three
Fighting Services might,arouse serious alarmand agitation for increased expenditure^    TheService Departments were not afraid of diselos-ing their strength &quot;but of revealing their weak-ness*    Under the proposals of the netherlands government more information would have to be given to the public than it was now the practice to lay before Parliament.    It night well be thatthe adoption of the proposals would lead to anincrease rather than a decrease in ex-penditure on armaments.It was also pointed out that Hollandwas a country which had? for all practical pur-poses disarmed herself and that the proposalaccordingly involved her in no risk.    It vrasimprobable that other countries would send in truereturns end the practice would grow up of increasing secret reserves.The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to the fact that on the 24th November Lord Cecilhad sent a second telegram? No.  152 L.N.. in thefollowing termss-&quot;Following from Lord   Cecil;-Publicity of materials Dutch proposal.Lly technical advisers have drawn nyattention to report of Co I.Do  90L-BJuly 192G s paragraph 2 B referring to similtu?

The Cabinet agreed.  (i) That Lord. Cecil should be informedforthwith that the Government agreed,to his acting on the decisionreferred to in his telegram Lb.  152 L.H.of the 24th November 1950, namely thathe should support a disclosure ofeffectives and military programmes providedthat information in regard to the latter was confined to that which is normallypresented to Parliament.(ii) That Lord Cecil should also be informedthat if he required further instuctions in regard to this matter he must ashspecially for them.
Ilicy., t I C * * oletement of thekncipal measures-Lg taken by HisLjesty1 s Govern-fent in connectionith. Unemploymentopreviousjeference:Cabinet62(30)Conclusion 6)2,    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Prime Minister (Paper 0. P. 391(30))covering the proof of a White Paper entitled&quot;Statement of the Principal Measures takenby His Majesty1s Government in connectionwith Unemployment11.    In his Memorandums thePrime Ministers after pointing out that ithad been the practice for the Government topresent progress reports to Parliament atsix monthly intervals and that the time had now cone for the presentation of a further statement of the progress made in regard to public works and develop ment approved forGovernment financial assistances expressedthe view that on the present occasion thestatement should not be confined to activities in the field of public works; but should com-prise a brief review of the principal measurestakensand the policy oursuedj in other fieldsin connection with Unemployment0At the cutset the Prime Minister invit-ed his colleagues to say whether the publi-c at ion of the white Paper at this juncturecommended itself to thems and also whetherthey had any comments to   make on its form.As a result of a preliminary examinationthe following suggested modifications ofthe draft White Paper were adopted:-(1) Under the heading &quot;Industrial Re-Organisation&quot; some reference to expenditure on maintenance andalso of juvenile and adult train-ing schemes should be included.
(2)    A reference should be inserted regardingthe new Ounard ships which might be insome such terras as follows:&quot;The Government took an interestin these vessels from the timewhen their construction was first contemplated and havebeen able to provide facilitiesfor insurance to over bothconstruction and ordinary maritimerisks.&quot;(3)    Some reference in very general terms should be inserted to the efforts which are being made by the Governmentto encourage the development of new and specialise-.), industries, but no mention by name should be :,iade ofthe hydrogenation proposal.(4)    The First Lord of the Admiralty under-took to draft a paragraph for insertionrespecting the facilities fcr promoting the use of 20 ton. wagons under the-development Act,  1929.(5)    The Minister of Agriculture andFisheries agree! to prepare an expanded paragraph on the work of the forestry Commission to replace the paragraph in the middle of page 7 ofthe draft ,7hite Paper.The Cabinet then proceeded to considerthe draft TVh.ite Paper from the point of view ofits effect on public opinion.    General agreement was expressed with the view that the White paper should contain a more vigorous and definite statementof the Government&apos;s intentions in regard to their long range policy and that the nature of the problem should be set out and the various ways in which theGovernment were approaching the solution should beIn the course of discussion the cabinet were reminded that when account had been taken ofall Government activities the number of persons who
had &quot;been placed in employment as compared withthe numbers of unemployed was very small.   Inthis connection special emphasis was laid on thedesirability of taking every possible step to ex-pedite schemes which had already been approved endit was urged that this could not be satisfactorilyaccomplished until the work was entrusted to somecentralised authority^The view was expressed that as soon asthe Cabinet Committee on Trade Policy had examined the various documents steps should be taken to seeto what extent an arrangement cUuld be entered intowith the Liberal Opposition to secure the speeding-up of work generally and also to examine to what ex-tent recourse should be had to emergency powers.In particular reference was made to the need forhastening the reorganisation of industry.    TheCabinet were reminded thats even under most favour-able conditionss delays were often inevitable and5in this connections reference was made to the ex-periences of the war years a    Ic was suggested that what was really needed was some centralised coordin-ating authority which could arrive at quick decisions.The Prime Minister reminded his colleagues that the Minister who wao responsible for coordinatingthe work of the various Departments and. removingcauses of friction was the Lord Privy Seal as regardswork concerning Unemployment and the President of theBoard of Trades with the assistance of Sir PL J.1?ilsons as regards the won.; of industrial develop-ment.    In the case where a single department only
was concerned obviously the solo responsibilitymust rest with the ministerial head of that department,,    After considerable further discus-sion the Cabinet agreed  (a) That Mr H0  Da Henderson shouldbe instructed to prepare a re-vised draft of the White paper which revise should incorporate-atc:(i)    paragraphs at the begin-ning of the White paper setting out the generalfeatures of the problems and at the end setting out s in paragraph sum-mar ys the Government&apos;programme of work inhand and accomplishedtogether with a generalparagraph making an ap-jjropriate and hearteningconclusion,(ii)    any special paragraphswhich Cabinet ministers might send to Llr Hendersonbefore the end of the pre-sent week.(iii)    the various alterations men-tioned at the commencementof this Conclusion,,(b) Thct the Draft White Paper when re-vised should   be submitted by MrHenderson to the Parliamentary Under-Secret ary of State for Scotland andjif approved by Mr Johnstons should be circulated to the Cabinet for furtherconsideration.,(c) To request the Minister of health to enquire into the alleged delayswith regard to the two West Ham im-provement schemes referred to inthe discussion.
3. The attention of the Cabinet was directed,as a matter of urgency, to the situation which had arisen with regard to the proposed appointment of a royal Commission to inquire into UnemploymentInsurance.The Cabinet were informed that there was noreason to apprehend that the Liberal Party would raisedifficulties with regard to the Unemployment Insurance(No.. 4) Bill, provided that when the Bill was intro-duced it was made clear that the Royal Commission would&quot;Be a small business-like body which would furnishinterim reports and which was being established, not for the purpose of delaying, but in order to expedite the settlement of the points at issuo.The Cabinet were also informed that up to thepresent the Representatives of the General Councilof the Trades Union Congress had adopted a hostileattitude towards the Royal Commission and its terms ofreference, and it seemed doubtful whether if an invitation was sent to the General Council asking themto nominate a representative on the Commission, thata favourable reply would be forthcoming.In the course of a discussion, special reference was made to the serious political consequences,which might result from a refusal by the general council to nominate a representative in response to anofficial invitation from the Government, and thesuggestion was made that before any official letter was sent, steps should be taken to ascertain the probableresponse of the General Council to such a letter.
The Cabinet agreed  (l) To invite the Home Secretary toarrange to confer informally withthe General Council of the TradesUnion Congress that same afternoon.+(2)  That if,  as a result of the conferencementioned in (1) above,  the HomeSecretary ascertained that the general council of the Trades Union Congresswas unwilling to nominate a representative on the proposed Royal Commission,  noletters of invitation should issue,either to the General Council of theTrad.es Union Congress or to the confederation of Employers&apos;  Organisations,to nominate Representatives on theCommission repsectively,  and the composition of the Commission should accordingly be restricted to persons nominated by the Government,  to whomofficial invitations should be sent.(3) That the Minister of Labour should confer with the Home Secretaryimmediately after his conference withthe General Council of the TradesUnion Congress,  and should have authority,   in consultation with theHome Secretary,  to issue the lettersof invitation forthwith.Arrangements were made on the telephone for thismeeting while the Cabinet was in session.

The Cabinet had before them a most secretdocument (paper CP.  392 (30))  entitled &quot;Observations onthe Liberal Proposals for dealing with Unemployment&quot;.As explained in the covering note, the ministers concerned had furnished the Prime Minister with their comments on the Liberal proposals contained in thepamphlet &quot;How to Tackle Unemployment&quot;.      In accordancewith the Prime Minister&apos;s instructions these Ministerialmemoranda, prefaced by an introductory note and summaryprepared under the direction of the Lord Privy Seal, were now circulated to the Cabinet.The Cabinet took note of the document inquestion.

COAL-ion..reviousef erence:abinet4 (30)conclusion 9.)5. At the request of the Prime Ministery-thePresident of the Board of Trade gave to the cabinet an appreciation of the present situation in theCoal industry.     After mentioning that the CabinetCommittee appointed at the last meeting of the cabinet had met on the previous evening and had then received an account of tho position to date from the Secretaryfor Mines, Mr. Graham stated that over most of thocoal-fields arrangements were in process of being effected.      In Northumberland and Durham there weuldbe no spread-(\ver and no reduction of wages, and a7^-hour day weuld be worked.    In Cumberland and north Wales a spread-over with np reduction cf wageswas the solutian proposed.Only in Scotland and in South Wales was theposition serious.     In both these cases the owners were insisting en a drastic reduction of wages.&apos; The Industrial Board was meeting to-day andwould, it was hoped, hear applications from SouthWales tomorrow,  and from Scotland on Friday.     the beard could only make recommendations, and,: it must beremembered that the owners had refused to recogniseit.The Beard could either recommend that the act of 1930 should be postponed so as to give more time forconsideration, or that a spread-over arrangement should be accepted, or seme other solution ohouldbe found.     While there was no reason to fear a stoppage in other parts of the country,  there wasdanger of a stoppage in Scotland and S^uth V/ales,and owing to the weakness in numbers of the Miners&apos;Federation and the heavy unemployment, it might be
-    361     Iexpected that many men v/culd he prepared to go to workon the owners&apos;  terms.    On the other hand,  the scottish and South Wales owners undoubtedly feared that in theevent of a stoppage they would lose business to other districts.In the course of discussion the Cabinet woreassured that in his discussions with the Chairman of theIndustrial Board, the Secretary for Mines had limitedhimself to explaining the position and to suggesting whatin his (Mr. Shinwell&apos;s)  view appeared to be the mosthopeful line cf approach to a solution.    It had, for example,been made clear that every effort should be made to avoid a suspension of the 1930 Act and to prevent a stoppage.Prominent members of the Miners1 Federation had stated thatthey regarded a spread-over without any reduction of wagesas the probable ultimate solution.The President of the Board of Trade and theSecretary of State for War stated that they had come to theconclusion that there was no alternative to the policy whichwas being pursued by tho Secretary for Mines, and they were fully prepared to defend and justify that policy.On the other hand, the Cabinet were informed thatin. South Wales an 8-hour day would be preferred by the mento the spread-over which was likely to create a very serious position.The Cabinet agreed  To request the president of. the Boardof Trade to keep in the closest touchwith all the interests concerned, andto report at once to the Prime minister in the event of any emergency orsubstantial change in the situation arising.

With reference to the discussion noted inthe margin,  the Cabinet had under considerationMemoranda by the President of the Board of Trade(CP.  376 ( 30)),  and the Home Secretary (CP.  379 (30))on the question of Irish Lighthouses, and agreed  To invite the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs and the HomeSecretary to confer on the methodsof procedure discussed in the abovenamed memoranda, and if possibleto reach agreement.
OPOSED TARIFFABSENCEWEEN canada the WESTIES.reviousefcrence:binet 54(30)Conclusion 7) .7. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for the Colonies (CP. 385 ( 30))stating that the negotiations mentioned in his formerMemorandum (CP. 302 (30)) had been continued, andthat Canada was now said to be willing to take partin a conference at any time after the middle ofJanuary next.      It was doubtful whether the west indian sugar industry would obtain any advantage, butit was proposed to sound the Colonies concerned, andto discover what subjects they would wish discussed;,it would then be time to consider the question- of .sanctioning the Conference.    If it took place, theUnited Kingdom should be represented by an observerwith a watching brief.The real point was one for unofficial dis-cussion, viz: how to obtain for the West Indianproducers from the Canadian refinors a larger shareof the tariff preference given by Canada.The Secretary of State for the colonies informed the Cabinet that, after consulting the PrimeMinister, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theSecretary of State for Doninion Affairs, he haddespatched telegrams tui the West Indies informing them of an invitation to moot the Australian Ministeref Markets at New York on the 15th - 16th December,.and asking whether they wished to send a Representative.The Cabinet took note tff these communications.
3.    The Cabinet had under consideration aMemorandum by the Secretary of State for theColonies (CP.  395 (30)) referring to the cabinet decision (mentioned in the margin)   to adoptthe new policy of allowing foreign-controlledoil companies to operate, su5ject to certain conditions, in British territory.The Cabinet agreed  That the consideration of thisquestion should be deferred until the next Meeting of theCabinet.
LcHANT SKIPPING 9 pSTY CONVENTION)previous!reference:binet 65(30exclusion 18The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the President of the Board of Trade(CP. 394 ( 30))  reporting that the shipowners,who had been shown the Government Bill on the 8thAugust, had behaved in an unreasonable manner,and had at the last moment introduced a rival Bill.Both Bills wore now before the House of Lords.The Shipowners&apos; Bill purported to bring into force,not only the Safety Convention (from July 1st 1931),but also the Load Line Convention (from July 1st1932) ,The Cabinet also had before them a letterfrom the Lord President of the Council to thePresident of the Board of Trade (Paper CP. 399 (30))Lord Parmoor saw some advantage in including bothConventions in one Bill, and this could be made amatter of arrangement.      If such agreement could besecured, the helm orders proposal would not giverise to serious difficulty.     On the question oftime, there seemed to be little difference betweenproceeding with the present Bill and arranging fora new one.The Cabinet agreed  (l) To invite the President of theBoard of Trade to confer with theLord President of the Council inregard to the situation respecting the Bills which has arisen in&apos; theHouse of Lords,and subject thereto.(ii) To authorise the President toendeavour to come to an arrangeme^li-lbwith the shipowners on the lines get out in CP. 394 (30), on the Under-standing that, if successfulj hewould also consult the ParliamentaryOppositions.

The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Minister of Transport (CP.  396 (30))regarding the Co-ordination of London passenger traffic, in which it was stated that negotiationswith the interests affected were in progress, andthat it would shortly be possible to instruct theDraughtsman to prepare a Bill.     parliamentary counsel had, however, advised that as the proposedmeasure affected private rights, it would probably have to proceed as a hybrid Bill.     The Ministerreported that he had therefore given instructions for the preparation and issue of the Press andGazette notices necessary to prove compliance withStanding Orders.     The first notices must appearnot later than December 4th.The Cabinet took note of and approved the action taken by the Minister ofTransport as sot forth in CP. 396 ( 30),

In the view of the Home Secretary,the Government Spokesman had no alternative but toexplain to the House that the Bill contains proposalswhich go far beyond any possible measure of agreementbetween the different Members of the Commonwealth,and that, as it is essential to maintain uniformity,the Government cannot support the Second Reading ofthe Bill.      In answer to any criticism that might bemade that it is unfair that British women shouldcontinue to suffer their existing disabilities byreason of marriage to an alien, the Government
Spokesman should he authorised to say that the Governmentare prepared to consider the question of promotinglegislation to enable women, who by reason of marriagehad lost their British nationality, to enjoy the rightsand privileges to which they would be entitled or would receive, so far as action by this country is con-cerned, if they had not lost their British nationality.The Cabinet agreed  That in the Debate on the 2SthNovember, the Government spokesman should adopt the general linerecommended by the Secretary ofState for Home Affairs as summarised above.

It was suggested to the Cabinetthat in the event of the Bill being reached,the Government1s attitude should be to theeffect that they viewed the object of theBill with great sympathy but that they couldnot undertake to take airy action at present or to agree to the proposed Exchequer grantof 90h.    Moreover,  the conditions of government business did not offer any hope that a timefor the passage of the measure could be found.The Cabinet agreed -To authorise the GOver:riieirtSpokesman to adopt towards theBill the attitude summarised above.
