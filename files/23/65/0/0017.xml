HE CHARGINGmRc OFRflWAY, EAR-OUR, DOCFND PIER ANDANAL UNDFR-AFINGS.FXi1.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Transport (CP.-369  (30))  or, thesubject of the charging powers of tramway, harbour,dock and pier and oanal undertakings, which beforethe War   were regulated by Statute.    Circumstancesarising out of the War, however, had made thesemaximum charges Inadequate in many cases,  and Parlia-ment had empowered the Minister of Transport to issue orders as a temporary measure modifying the permanentmaximum charging powers.    The temporary Acts governing the charging powers of these undertakings had from.time to time been continued by the Expiring laws continuance Act.    Although, in the opinion of theMinister of Transport, the more satisfactory course might be to introduce in the coming  Session a short bill to give permanent effect to Orders and Directionsissued by the Minister, in view of the pressure uponParliamentary time he thought the most practicalcourse would be a further extension of the temporaryActs for a further period of at least one year,obtained through the Expiring Laws Act of 1931.    he therefore sought the authority of the Cabinet toinform..the undertakers at once in this sense and todiscuss with them the introduction of permanent legislation in the 1931/32 Session of Parliament.The Cabinet approved the Ministerof Transport&apos;a proposal as set forth above.
2.  The Cabinet had. before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Transport (CP.-370 (30)) in regardto the Battersea Power Station.    In this memorandum the Minister recalled that with a previous Paper(CP.-293 (29)) he had submitted a Report from a departmental Committee appointed to advise the first commissioner of Works and the Electricity Commission-ers as to the efficacy of the measures proposed tobe adopted by the London Power Company for the elimin-ation of sulphur fumes in connection with the workingof the Battersea Power Station.    In that Report theCommittee stated that they had examined an Interim.Report from the Advisers of the Company and consider-ed that while the experimental work so far reportedindicated, that it was possible to eliminate nearlythe whole of the gases present, they vrould prefer,before reporting on the practicability of the process,to await the results proved by a larger experimentalplant then in course of erection.    He had now received, and had appended to CP.-370 (30), thesecond Report of the Power Company&apos;s Advisers,together with a Report thereon by the committee presided over by the Government Chemist stating thatthe Committee are satisfied that the elimination ofsulphur gases at the exit in these experiments was nearly complete, but,that the process used wascapable of improvement in several directions,including cost.    The Minister of Transport thereforesaw no reason why the first section of the BatterseaPower Station should be interfered with.   A further questions was the application of the Fulham borough council for a large extension to their generating station.   The Electricity Commissioners felt it wouldbe necessary to hold a public Inquiry on thisapplication early in the autumn, in which the Minister-2-
of Transport concurred,  since it was  of the utmost importance to the future of London electricity supply to issue a decision before the end of the year.The Minister recommended that the two Reports annexed to his Memorandum ( CP.-570 (50)) should be publishedwithout delay for general information as well as forthe consideration of the public bodies concerned,and that with the published Reports there should be printed an introductory note, the terms of whichwere set out at the end of the Memorandum, which hadreceived the concurrence of the Minister of health and the First Commissioner of Works.The Minister of Transport made a short statement to the Cabinet, in the course of which,  in answer to questions, he explained that if the Battersea power company failed to take the necessary steps to eliminate smoke, grit and sulphur fumes, theElectricity Commission would be responsible for taking appropriate action to compel them to do so.The Cabinet approved the proposalsof the Minister of Transport as setforth above, and agreed that the twoReports attached to his Memorandum(CP.-370 (30)) should be publishedwithout  delay for general informationas well as for the consideration ofthe public bodies concerned, and thatwith the published Reports there shouldbe an introductory note in the terms set out in the Minister&apos;s Memorandum.

The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs raised as a matter of urgency the Governments policyin Palestine, as bearing on the Permanent mandates commission at Geneva and consequently on the work ofthe Foreign Secretary as our representative on theCouncil of the League of Nations, as well as on thehome political situation.There was general agreement that a CabinetCommittee should be appointed at once to considerthe question.    In the course of the discussion itwas suggested that the Cabinet Committee might with advantage invite the co-operation of some legalauthority on the juridical aspects of the question.The Lord Advocate of Scotland was suggested.    It was further proposed that the Cabinet Committee should get In touch with the representatives of the Zionistsin the most politic and tactful manner possible inthe circumstances and should make recommendations asto the attitude to be taken up by the Government inview of the reception of the recently-issued white paper.   The Committee was asked to bear in mind theimportance of inapressi^iapon the Government of palestine to keep in close touch with both Jews and Arabs beforeissuing certain edicts now under consideration.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That if public statements are to beissued in regard to our policy inPalestine, the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs,  in consequenceof the fact that he represents theGovernment on the Council of theLeague of Nations, should be con-suited,  and his Department shouldbe given an opportunity of studyingany proposed statement in its bearing on foreign affairs :(b) That a Cabinet Committee,  composed as follows -The Secretary of State for the Colonies,The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,The First Lord of the Admiralty -
should meet to consider thePalestine situation:(c) That the Committee should decide as to whether any announcement,whether in Parliament or through some less formal channel, shouldbe made in regard to its appoint-ment, but that before doing so they should, ascertain from thePrime Minister the results of conversations he was expectingto have the same day.

In a Summarised Reportcovering the full Report the follow-ing conclusions were set forth:-BUDGETARY LIMITATION.(a) That  from the Treasury aspect nodifficulties are anticipated whichshould not be capable of reasonableadjustment at Geneva,(b) That from the Admiralty point ofview there is no objection, but our acceptance of this principle for the Navy should be made subject to the attitude of theother Naval Powers and to theconditions of Article 21 of theLondon Naval Treaty if France andItaly have been unable to composetheir differences:(o) That from the War Office aspectthe application of this principle is not only feasible but essential:(d) That the Air Ministry, having found themselves unable to recommend thatthis principle can be applied without detriment to national security, thematter must be referred back to theCabinet for final decision.HORSE-POWER LIMITATION FQR AIRCRAFT.(a) That, as the practical applicationof horse-power limitation to aircraftappears to present grave technical difficulties;    and as the onlymethods of measuring horse-power at present devised can be easilyevaded or will require a measureof international supervision^it is generally undesirable,
expenditure on civil aircraft would be exempt fromlimitation and consequently civil machines, whichcould rapidly be adapted and were eminently suitable*or offensive operations,  could be built in largenumbers, whereas fighting machines, by which alonethe extreme vulnerability to air attach of Londoncould be countered, would be limited.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve generally the Reports ofthe Cabinet Committee:(b) As regards BUDG ET ARY LIMIT AT ION,that, having regard to the extentto which the United Kingdom isalready committed to the principle,it should be re-affirmed, but that theSecretary of State for Foreign affairs should call the attention of the UnitedKingdom Delegates at the PreparatoryCommission, now in Session at Geneva,to the objections and risks set forthby the Secretary of State -**or Air andincorporated in the Report attached to cp.-371 (30):from a national security pointof view, to accept this form of limitation;(b) That, in view of the fact that some embarrasment might te caused tothe United Kingdom Delegates to thePreparatory Commission if they were instructed to reopen this question,it will be more suitable if the initial move is left to the CanadianDelegate, who can, in due course,receive support from the UnitedKingdom Delegation.A Note by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs (cp-371-A (30))covering a Supplementary Report ofthe Cabinet Committee on Article I*G,of the Draft Disarmament Convention,recommending that the United kingdom delegates to the Preparatory commission should be instructed, to oppose the insertion of Article I.G. vin regardto the mercantile marine as an element in &quot;war potential&quot;) in the draftDisarmament Convention.The Secretary of State for Air made a full statement of the difficulties of the Air ministry in the application of budgetary limitation, at theconclusion of which he laid stress on the fact that

It was of great importance that these Reports should be considered before theywere discussed at a Meeting of the Prime ministers and Heads of Delegations.The Cabinet agreed  CabinetThat the/Committee set up at theMeeting referred to in the marginshould be authorised to deal withthe Reports of the Economic Co-operation Committee and other matters arising on the Economic side of theImperial Conference, with full powersto act, but on the understanding thatthe Cabinet would be consulted if any newprinciple. of major policy is involved.Later in the Meeting it was arranged that theabove Committee should meet on the following day,Friday, November 7th, at 9 a,id., at 10 Downing Street.

The general conclusion reached as the result of these preliminary conferenceswas that Lancashire was beginning to learn from bitterexperience that the Individual and highly sectionalisedorganisation of the Cotton Industry, which had workedso successfully in the past, was no longer suited to modern conditions.     The two Ministers, however, were convinced that the co-operative sense was growing.The Memorandum further stated that all sections had laid emphasis on the damage which the Cotton Industryis suffering In consequence of the unrest in Indiaand urged that the Government should take every    .practical step to put an end to the existing state ofaffairs.   All that the Home Secretary and the Presi-dent of the Board of Trade could do, however,, was to promise that at the forthcoming india Round-table conference the important interests of Lancashire inrelation to India would not be overlooked.The Home Secretary and the President of the Boardof Trade assured the Cabinet that everything possiblewas being done to expedite the process of reorganlaa-tion, etc., of the Cotton industry.

TheCompany now made a further application for enrolment,and while there appeared to be no valid reason why it should be rejected, it was felt that the question was one of general policy for consideration by theCabinet.The Cabinet invited the Minister of Labour tomake further enquiries in regard to this matter, moreparticularly as to the truth of the reports that theRussian Cil Products, Limited, were discharging theirBritish employees and engaging more Russians and thatthey were able to introduce Russians without obtain-ing a certificate from the Ministry of Labour.Pending these enquiries the Secretary was instructedto keep the subject on the Agenda Paper of the Cabinet
