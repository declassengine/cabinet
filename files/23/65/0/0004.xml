2.     The Cabinet had before - them a R e.:i.-orandvi:-vby the President of the Board o^  ducat ion(C.P.-3Q3 (oC))  on the subject of raising theschool-leaving age and maintenance allowances.A^ter discussion with the Chancellor of theExchequer, and with his concurrence,  thePresident proposed that maintenance allowances should be limited to cases in which the parents&apos;income does not exceed  3 a week if they have oneo&quot; two child-en:     3:5:0 if they have threechildren:     3:15:0 if they have four children: 4:5:0 if they have five children:     4:15:0 ifthey have six children:     5:5:0 if they haveseven or more children.    Ee estimated that approximately 75 per cent, of the children of14 to 15 in the schools would receive allowanceson this basis .    The President thought that LocalAuthorities could not be prohibited from verifyingthe applications of parents if they thought fit.Fe proposed, to secure the agreement of the LocalEducation Authorities to the scheme, though hewarned thCabinet that the Local Authorities had originally pressed for 100 per cent, grant, andit would b e by no imeans easy to persuade them towork riQy- proposals on the basis of a 60 per cent,grant, particularly if, at the same time,  they weredeprived of the discretionary powers that theywould, have had under the Report o^ their ownCommittee.    If the Local Authorities continued topress for a higher rate he was prepared to proceedwith the Bill without any further concession to than&quot;.
The Cabinet-&apos; approved the above proposals, and authorised the x3resident ofthe Board of Education to proceed-with thepreparation of a Bill.NOTE:-    It toas suggested that, beforethe Bill was introduced,  itwould be advisable to discuss it with supporters of theGovernment in the House ofCommons.tehall Gardens t.
