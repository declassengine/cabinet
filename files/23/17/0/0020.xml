(This Document if the Property of HisBritannia Majesty*s Government).EGRET.      /,2,0 WAR CABINET.NOTES OP A CONVERSATION at 1Q Downing Street. S.W.,on PRIDAY, JULY 12, 1918, at 11 a.m.Present;THE PRIME MINISTER (in the Chair);The Rt. Hon. the Viscount Milner,G.CB., G. C.M.G. 9 Secretary ofState for War;The Rt. Hon. A. Bonar Law, M.P.,Chancellor of the Exchequer;(Part of the time only);General Sir H.H.Wilson, K.C.B., D-S.O.,Chief of the Imperial General Staff;Lieutenant Colonel L.S.Amery, M.P*,WESTERN ERONT.GENERAL WILSON explained that the divisions of the D.A.N.,had now been removed.    As regards infantry, Sir Douglas Haigwas glad to be quit of these particular French troops, whohad shown themselves very reluctant to dig, and otherwiseunsatisfactory, and was much happier with the Americanswhich would replace them.    As regards artillery, sir douglas haig had brought up the guns of the British divisions inthe Champagne, so that the situation was substantially unal-tered.    In spite of the possibly very heavy odds of 100 to45 divisions which Sir Douglas Haig might have to encounter9he was more satisfied about the situation than before.    our preparations for defence had greatly improved, the troops had had a certain amount of rest, and the new railways, as wellas the railway through Amiens, were now working.    General
!- - 85Rawlinson oonsidered that the recent little advance atHamel had pushed back the German guns to the width of thewhole valley further away from Amiens.    GENERAL WILSON was,however, writing a strong letter to General poch layingstress on the seriousness of the menace to which the british front was exposed.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that it might be better if general Wilson,s letter were couched in the form of a report,and if he himself sent it to General Pooh in order to lay stress upon his right to communicate with General poch, andto remind the latter that he was just as much responsible tothe British Government as to the French.MR BONAR LAW suggested that though M.  Clemenceau did notsend to us copies of all the letters he wrote to GeneralPoch, it might be a good thing if a copy of the prime Min-isterrs letter were sent to him.It was decided that:-The Prime Minister should write to General poch,as suggested, and should send a copy of theletter to M. clemencoau .AMERICAN OOOPERATIONoTHE PRIME MINISTER drew attention to the fact that theFrench had secured the bulk of the American divisions for themselves.    In view of the danger to which our front was ex-posed, he considered they had too large a proportion, and wished, in any case, to be assured that General Fochrs re-serves were so disposed as to enable help to reach the british front quickly.    He also observed that m. Clemenceau had morethan hinted that he was getting hold of the American divisions in order to compel us to re-fill our own.    This was an unjustified-fiable attempt to put pressure upon us.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,July 15, 1918.E
