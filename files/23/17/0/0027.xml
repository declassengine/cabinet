C S S I...-27.(This Document is the Property of HisBritannic Majesty1s Government)WAR GABIPET.NOTES OP A CONVERSATION at 10 Downing Street, S.W.,on SATURDAY, AUGUST 31, 1918, at 11.15 a.rn.Pre s e n t:The Prime Minister (in the Chair):The Rt. Hon. A. Bonar Law, M.P.,Chancellor of the Exchequer:  (for item 1 only).The Rt. Hon.  the Viscount Milner,G.C.Bo, G.C.MoG., Secretary ofState for War:The Rt. Hon. Sir George Cave, ICC,MoP., Secretary of State for HomeAffairs:  (for item 1 only).General Sir H.R.Wilson, 1.0.3., D.S.O.,Chief of the Imperial General Staff:Lieutenant-General Sir C.P.N.Macready,K.C.B.-, K.C.M.G., Adjutant General tothe Forces:  (for item 1 only)HE POLICEiRIKE.(Sir Maurice Hankey only arrived towardsthe end of the discussion).(1) SIR GEORGE CAVE drew attention to the risk that if thequestion of the police strike v/ere not settled at once itwould be raised at the Trades Union Congress next week,and might lead to sympathetic strikes in many quarters.GENERAL WILSON suggested that an offer should be madeto the strikers either to bring them back as individuals, or,in the event of their declining, to take them as Privatesfor the Army.    He understood that this would raise diffi-culties of ;oolicing London,  but by enlisting special con-stables and rnaxing some use of the Military, it ought to bepossible to surmount this difficulty.1.
SIR GEORGE GAVE asked if the Prime Minister would seeSir Edward Henry, who was at 10 Downing Street?THE PRIME MINISTER replied in the negative. He said he would wish to discuss the question of Sir Edward Henrywhen the present crisis was over.MR BONAR LAW said the important thing was to get thecountry behind the Government, and then they would have nodifficulty in getting special constables.THE ADJUTANT GENERAL expressed doubts as to whether there were enough individuals with leisure to act as special constables.SIR GEORGE GAVE thought that ample could be obtainedamong the middle classes if the country was behind the Gov-ernment.    He himself felt it was essential to give the mensome means of collective representation of their grievances.THE PRIME MINISTER said he had asked Sir ErederickWodehouse on the previous evening what means of representa-tion they had, and it really appeared that they had none.THE SECRETARY pointed out that the Police had precise-ly the same means of collective representation as the Army,that is to say, they could make representations through their Inspectors&apos;and Superintendents, whose task it was to acquaint the superior Officers of any grievances.THE PRIME MINISTER did not consider this by any meansadequate.    He said that the decision as to the action to betaken should be postponed until he had seen the men&apos;s repre-sentatives, who, he heard, were shortly coming to downing street.    Until he had ascertained the temper of the men itwould be premature to reach a decision.THE WEST- (2) GENERAL WILSON said he had heard from Sir Douglas HaigSHN PEONT.that Marshal Poch proposed to press on with the successful
operations on the British front.    He was seeding-- 2 divisions of Americans te.......relieve the Canadians.THE PRIME MINISTER reminded General Wilson that lastyear we had lost about 150,000 man at Bullecourt.    To al-low the Canadians to be sacrificed as the Australians hadbeen last year in attaching in this difficult region wouldbe sheer folly.    He thought that some indication should begiven that the War Cabinet did not want a repetition oflast year&apos;s experience.    If the Americans got badly smashedup it would be as bad as in the case of the Canadians, since in that case General Pershing would never send any more mento the British line.GENERAL WILSON expressed general agreement.    He was not aware as yet as to whether the fighting at Bullecourt hadbeen really heavy.    The stiff fighting reported by the press at various points had really only engaged small bodies oftroops.    Apart from the points where we were in touch withthe Hindenburg line the fighting was not very heavy, as our troops were advancing across open country without much re-assistance.    When he had discussed the situation ,/ith Pie Id Mar-shal Haig on Monday, Sir Douglas had made it clear that he did not mean to press his operations if they involved heavy casualties.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff undertook to telegraph to field Marshal Haig warning him thatthe War Cabinet would not approve of heavy casual-ties.....being incurred by British or American;troopsin attacks on the Hindenburg line*v-i,^^U\sasi^h U^w^--(3)  GENERAL WILSON gave a sketch of the plans which MarshalPoch had intended to undertake with the American forces.    he himself and Field Marshal Haig had not agreed with marshal foch on this matter, and had wanted to attache at the point(which he indicated) where they considered that a more
important strategical objective presented itself.In reply to the Prime Minister he said that a difference of opinion had arisen between Marshal Poch and General Per-shing as to the employment of the American forces.    general pershing wanted to carry out certain operations with an Amer-ican Army under his own immediate command.    Marshal Foch,however,  did not consider the American staff work sufficient-ly advanced to render this advisable.    In the neighbourhoodof Chateau Thierry, the Americans had only just avoided aserious disaster, owing to defective staff work.    marshal foch,  consequently, wanted to employ part of the iuaericanforces with the British and part with the French, leaving on-ly one Army under General Pershing&apos;s command.    He himself and field Marshal Haig agreed with Marshal Foch in this matter,and Sir Douglas Haig had talked very straight to general pershing on the subject.    General Pershing had, nevertheless,been entirely uninfluenced by the views of his colleagues,and it was he, and not Marshal Foch, who had removed theAmerican divisions from Sir Douglas Haig!s Command,    when he left France he had understood that General Pershing&apos;s view wasto prevail.    This morning, however, he had received a guardedmessage from Field Marshal Haig in the sense that Seeds: marshal foch was now more inclined to agree with the views of general wilson and himself.    General Wilson was unable to say whetherthis telegram referred to the strategical point of attack, orto the distribution of American forces, but, at any rate, it seemed to indicate a satisfactory tendency.    In his own opin-ion, if General Pershing insisted on making an attack with american troops only, he would either meet the Germans in large numbers in strongly fortified positions, and sufferheavy casualties,  or else his advance would collapse at a relatively early stage, owing to inadequate staff work.    Itwas a very difficult thing from a staff point of view to
Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,August 31, 1918.supply an Army of several hundred thousand men when it reach-ed any distance from the railhead.    The German staff work inthe advance from Hons,at the beginning of the War, man hadbeen marvellous in this respect.    It had also been extremelygood after the attach of March 21.    Nevertheless, on both oc-casions the advance had been brought to a standstill largely owing to the difficulties of supply.In reply to the Prime Minister he said that Marshal Pochwould choose the point; for General Pershing1 s attack, eventhough he did not impose his wishes as regards the distribu-tion of the American divisions.
