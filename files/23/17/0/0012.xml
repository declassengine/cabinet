(This Document is the Property of His Britannic&quot;       Majesty^s Government,)SECRET -X.-1S.WAR CABINET .NOTES of a CONVERSATION held at 10, Downing Street.S.W.,  on THURSDAY,  JUNE IS,  1918, at 11 a.m.The Right Hon. the Viscount Milner,G.G.B .,G.GoMoG., Secretary ofState for War.General Sir Henry H.Wilson, K.C.E.,D.S.O., Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff.Lieut.-Colonel Sir M.P.A.Hankey, K0C.B.,Secretary, War Cabinet,Lieut.-Colonel L8S.Amery, M.P.THE SITUATION IN FRANCE.GENERAL WILSON reported that the French were fairlysatisfied with the position.   All his information convinced himmore and more that the Germans meant to deliver their blow north of Amiens.   The Director of Military Intelligence was not certain whether the whole of the Crown Prince&apos;s reserves had yet been usedup, but in any case General Wilson thought that the Germans would continue the battle on the present front until the whole of theirPRESENT 5-ihe Prime Minister (in the Chair),
reserves were used up, in other words, possibly for another week,in order to draw down all they could of General Fooh7s reserves,before they struck against us.LORD MILNER suggested that possibly the German blow mightbe directed to Separating the two Armies South rather than north of Amiens, the Germans first pressing the French back on the envi-rons of Paris and then striking westwards towards Rouen and Havre.GENERAL WILSON replied that, wherever they struck,  general foch was determined to keep the two Armies in contact, and had made his arrangements accordingly.    In answer to questions by the PrimeMinister, GENERAL WILSON stated that the forthcoming offensivemight be expected to begin about the 31st, and last until July5th.   The Germans would then require at least a month&apos;s rest before they cou&amp;d make another attack.    Our own new crop of men would onlybegin to be available to fill up our Divisions from the middle ofAugust onwards, so that if the battle began again on the 5th Augustwe should have to depend upon the Americans.AMERICAN CO-OPERATION.LORD MILNER stated that the five American Divisions now with our Army would amount to about 100,000 men by the beginningof August.    By that time there would, of course, be a good many more American troops in France.   There were six Divisions comingthis month, but the question was whether they would be attached toxis .THE PRIME MINISTER considered it essential that we shouldmake a fight in order to secure the ten Divisions which had beenoriginally allotted to usaIn answer to the Prime Minister,  GENERAL WILSON admitted that some of the five American Divisions now with us might have tobe put into the line even before the 5th July, although it mightbe murder to do so.
FRENCH MORAL.THE PRIME MINISTER reported that M. Zakharoff, a friend of M.Clemenceau&apos;s,in a conversation with him had assured him that, although M. clemencoau  might fall, Prance was  bound to goon.   The women of France were absolutely sound,  and, as long asthey were so, no French statesman could breathe the word &quot;Peace&quot;.He thought that probably M. Briand or M.Bart ho u would come in.GENERAL WILSON mentioned that M.  Clemenceau was againurging very strongly that we were not playing our part as regardsthe provision of men.THE THREAT TO PARIS.*GENERAL WILSON reported that the population of Paris was now quite determined that they ought to go on whether Paris came under shell-fire or not.    What would be serious would be the rail-way situation if once the Germans got as far as Senlis or Meaux,and could get the Ceinture Railway under shell-fire,  as thatrailway was now carrying practically all the traffic between north, and South.    There were some single lines,  of very limitedcapacity, near Paris, and General Nash was going over to see which of them could be doubled.   GENERAL WILSON suggested that it was of great importance that the Prime Minister should get into touch with President Wilson, and find out what he was prepared todo if the French lost Paris and if the general situation becamecritical.    It was essential to know whether the United states were prepared to go  on in all circumstances.JAPANESE INTERVENTION IN RUSSIA.GENERAL WILSON reported that, when he was over in Francewith Lord Milner in the previous week, M. clemencoau  had statedthat he hoped to get an answer from President Wilson,  on the
2, Whit eha11 Gardens, S.W.,June 13,  19IS.subject of Japanese intervention in Russia, within 43 hours,through an American channel.    Failing such an answer, he would agree to General Poch*.s name being quoted in a telegram in favourof intervention, or to General Poch sending a message himself.Apparently no such answer iiad come, and he now gathered that M.clemenceau did not wish General Poeh tc send the message.LORD MILNER said that Id.  Clemenceau was very reluctant,in view of the great influence which General Pooh&apos;s name carriedwith President Wilson, to make too free use of it. He was afraid that we had really lost the tide in connection with intervention,owing to the fighting that was going on between the Ozecho-Slovaksand the organised prisoners of war in Siberia,,THE PRIME MINISTER considered, that M. Clemenceau was not really very eager about Japanese intervention at this moment, be-cause he doubted whether President Wilson really would take any action, and because he was more anxious to get his Gzeeho-Slovaksaway.
