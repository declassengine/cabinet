JULY 16, 1918, at 11 a.m.Present:-The Prime Minister (in the Chair);The Rt. Hon.  the Viscount Milner, G-.CB.G.C.M.G., Secretary of State for War;General Sir H.H.Wilson, K.C.B., D.S.C ,Chief of the Imperial General Staff;Lt0-Colonel Sir M.P.A.Eankey, K.C.B.,Secretary, War Cabinet.Lt.-Colonel L.S.Amery, M.P.,GENERAL WILSON reported that he had just heard that the germans had taken Beaumont, east of Rheims.    There had been fighting in Sil-lery on the previous day.    The Erench position on the Montagne deRheims was very strong.    They had two lines, one on the slopes andone on the crest.    He understood that the French oounter-attack hadnot been carried out yesterday.    Probably it was not necessary.The news generally was good, but it was by no means clear yet whatthe enemy were doing.    So far 26 infantry divisions and one cavalrydivision had been identified, and, of the former, 12 had been iden-justified east and 14 west of Rheims.    probably at least 36 divisions had actually been engaged.    Of those identified 9 came from princeRupprecht^s Army, 6 of them being identified in the Champagne sec-tor.    Only 5 of the divisions identified were divisions which had hitherto been in the line; the others belonged to the reserve ofone or other of the groups of armies.    The French so far had 37 di-visions, not including 2 Italian divisions, engs.ged.THE PRIME MINISTER drew attention to the fact that Sir douglas haig was of the opinion that the attack in the Champagne was not aTHE WESTERN FRONT.lo
serious one, and that Prince Rupprecht, who might still have 25divisions in the North, might he intending to attack the Britishfronts    General Smuts had reported that things were very much better.    This, he assumed, probably referred to General poch!plans for moving the British divisions round to the Champagne, andhe imagined that they were now going to the Marne, or possibly be-ing sent back to our front.It was agreed that:-The matter should be further discussed at theCommittee of Dominion Prime Ministers that afternoon on General smuts  return.THE ITALIAN SITUATION.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that, in view of the possibility ofthe Germans, if they failed on the West, striking at Italy In theautumn, that Lord Cavan might take -fcfee advantage of the presentlull in the operation to come home and discuss the whole matter with the Committee of the Prime Ministers.GENERAL WILSON mentioned that Lord Cavan was coming home in anycase in about 10 daysT time.THE HIGHER COMMAND.THE PRIME MINISTER drew attention to a letter from a CanadianOfficer, addressed to Sir Robert Borden, speaking very adverselyof the Higher Command, and appealing to Sir Robert Borden to set thematter right.    The question was one which the Dominion prime Min-ministers had raised at the opening Meetings of the present Sessionof the Imperial War Cabinet, not on the strength of newspaper opin-ions but on the reports of their own soldiers.    The Committee of prime Ministers had been specifically appointed to deal with thisquestion, and it was necessary for the British Government to beable to produce a definite answer.    The Government must either re-ply that it was satisfied with the present command, or announce that it meant to carry out changes.    Our own reports, from many
-    88quarters, as well as from Colonel Roure&quot;s report, showed that our whole organisation was unsatisfactory and wasteful.    He doubted whether the change in putting the railways under General Travers-Glarke had teen an improvement, and was inclined to think that thewhole jpcEs: of the Services behind the lines might be better put un-der a civilian administrator.    In any case, the whole questionought to be fully discussed with the Dominion Prime Ministers.LORD MILKER said that short of heroic remedies all that was pos-sible was being done to improve the organisation of the Army. Thequestion of making a change in the chief command had been repeated-ly discussed, but he was not yet clearly convinced that a bettersubstitute could be foundoMAN-POWER.SIR MAURICE HANKEY drew attention to an important paper from theMinistry of Munitions (G.1-5114), which had just come in, as wellas to the new Programme for the Air force (G.T-5096), and the needfor a general revision of the whole man-power situation,    in thisconnection he brought forward the following letter which he had re-ceived from General Smuts;-&quot;My dear Hankey. I trust the Air programme on today1s Agendawill not be dealt with apart from a general consideration ofthe man-power question which is being raised simultaneously bythe War priorities Committee in a resolution taken on Friday,and the Ministry of National Service in a paper to be circulate-ed shortly.    I understand the Ministry of Munitions is also put-ting forward a paper from the Munitions point of view.   Allthese might be considered together, and thereafter the question could be reviewed in detail by the old Man-power Committee.Yours sincerely, J.C.Smuts, 15th July, 1918.&quot;It was decided thatt-The question would have to be dealt with by the Committeeof Prime Ministers at an early date.GREEK SUPPLIES.THE PRIME MINISTER drew attention to the delays which he under-stood had occurred in connection with the equipment of the greek army, and thought that the whole matter should come up before theWar Cabinet at an early date.Lord Milner undertook to have a report prepared on thequestion with a view to a discussion at the War Cabinet,,Ss Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,     &quot;July 16, 1918. 3.
