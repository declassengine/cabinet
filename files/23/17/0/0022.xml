Theadditional 4 identified since the preceding day all belonged tothe Crown Prince1s Army.    The fact that the divisions identified-fied had not, for the most part, been in the line before, mightbe evidence of a serious attack, implying, as it did, that the fresh reserves were pushed forward through the line.    It wasnot quite clear how far this was really a heavy attack whichhad not come off.

The--German forces were apparently under&quot;the-;*eom-had..mand:i&quot;-of General von Mudras who/apparently replaced GeneralFritz von Below.    General von Mudra had commanded the Metzcorps before the War, and had been in charge of the fighting on the Mmmbjbank of the Meuse at Yerdun.THE PRIME MINISTER expressed considerable doubt whether thiswas really the big attach, and suggested that/9 Rupprecht di-visions identified up to date might only have been camouflageddivisions.    He drew attention to Sir Douglas Haig!s view thatan attach on both sides of Kemmel,in a strength of 16 to 18divisions, was imminent in 3 or 4 days1 time, and that sir douglas Haig was trying to get bach 2 of the divisions askedfor by General foch .GENERAL WILSON said that General Poch had promised to studythis point.THE PRIME MINISTER thought that some action should be takenin the matter,not only to get back our own divisions, but topress for more American divisions.    Sir Douglas Haig was not anxious to press for them at this moment, but his own opinion was that unless pressure were applied nothing would be done.In any case, he thought an answer was due to General Wilson1sletter to General foch , and his own letter to M. Clemenceausupporting it.GENERAL WILSON undertook to send a telegram to General Du Cane, to the effect thatthe Imperial War Cabinet were anxiousto see action taken with regard to theAmerican troops, especially in view ofthe report as to a possible attaok onKeramel.ALBANIA.GENERAL WILSON said that the average depth of advance hadbeen from 15 to 20 miles, but there was no reason why the
Allied Forces should not go as far as the River skumbi and oc-cupy the heights beyond so as to secure the road up the valleyto Lake Qjhrida.    The Austrians had sent a division away fromopposite the Italian front to relieve the situation in Albania.Attention was drawn to the action of the French General staffin trying to discourage the Italian advance for political rea-sons.THE ITALIAN SITUATION.THE PRIME MINISTER mentioned that he had heard from GeneralDelme Radcliffe that Lord Gavan might not be coming back tillAugust, and suggested that it would be better for general wilson to telegraph urging him to come back before that inorder to have an opportunity of talking about the Italian sit-nation with the Dominion prime Ministers.GENERAL WILSON undertook to telegraph accordingly., Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,July 17, 1918.
