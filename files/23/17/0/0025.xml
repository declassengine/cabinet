LoSo Amery, M0P0THE WESTERN FRONT.-CO-OPERATIONOE AMERICAN TROOPS._THE PRIME MINISTER drew attention to the latest telegrams which indicated that the French were intending to get the wholeof the American Army into their seetor0    He was convinced thatthis v/as part of the political game which General Foch wasplaying at Mo Clemenceau*s instigation.   The whole object ofit was, by depriving us of the support of the American troops,to force us to heap up our present total of 59 divisions regard-less of the effect upon our industries and national life generallyoIt was intolerable that the French should attempt to put thescrew xipon us in that way and he was determined that if thiscontinued he would ash the authority of the Gabinet to refuse theFrench any ships for the conveyance of American troops to France0Lord Reading had just telegraphed that it would be impossible tobring over the promised 100 divisions next year for want ofsJaippinge   We might conceivably, by a great effort, try and findmore shipping at the expense of other national services, but we certainly could not do that if the French game was what he
believed it to bee   He drew attention to the fact that we badalready crippled our agriculture and our coal mining, the latter to such an extent that ships were lying idle in Cardiff and ships from South America had to go round by the United States to pickup coal, that our aeroplane production was down 40$ during thepresent month and our tank production down to half the programme.He was determined to call a halt to this process of putting thescrew on us.     He would have to give the reasons quite plainlyto M. Clemenceau though not to the United States0LORD MILKER agreed but thought it was true that if we could put the screw on our own people to the extent which the French did,we could get more men, and on absolute figures the French had acase against us0COLONEL AMERY mentioned that he had been told on the previous day by the Chairman at Cammell Laird?s that his men were onlyworking 32 hours a week and that 2,000 of them were absent fromthe Sheffield works every day.TpE PRIME MINISTER admitted these defects of the &quot;black squad&quot;but the fact remained that they produced more than the shipwrightsof any other nation^GENERAL Y/ILSON mentioned that General foch  was definitelyasking for the number of British divisions he could reckon on forthe coming winter and spring and this request was on its way to usthrough Sir Douglas Haig*THE PRIME MINISTER said that this necessitated our definitelylaying down our own plans both as to the theatre of war in whichwe want our troops to fight and the number of divisions we were tokeep up.   We had made no promise to keep up 59 divisions beyondthe next big attack.   He had asked General Eoeh if he would be content if we kept up the number of divisions and lowered them tothe French standard.LORD MILNER pointed out that the British military view wasunanimous iar the reduction in the strength of 4$gfe battalions.THE PRIME MINISTER persisted that we could not keep up the

It wouldbe intolerable if our men had to stick in the trenches thewhole time and the French were getting leave in large numbers.GENERAL WILSON undertook to consider the question ofleave and to see what definite representations could be madeto the French to secure our position in the matter.
