so the WESTERN FROM?.Misohievous speeches in Parliament.TEE ERIME MINISTER read a letter from Mr. Geoffrey Bawsonof &quot;The Times&quot;, drawing attention to indiscreet and mis-ohievous speeches made the previous evening in Parliament by messrs pringle, Hogge, and Holt, suggesting the desirabilityof withdrawing our Army from France. Mr. Dawson had already taken steps to try and keep any report of the speeches outof the London morning papers.COLONEL AMERY put himself in communication with the Dir-eotor of Military Intelligence, who undertook to take stepswith a view to preventing the sending abroad of copies ofthe Hansard in question; of arranging, if possible, with the speaker for an alteration in Hansard; and for communicating with the Press Bureau to prevent a reference to these indis-oretions getting into the Provincial papers.    COLONEL AMERYsaw Mr. Bonar Law, who undertook to discuss with the Speakerwith a view to something being said privately to the offend-ing Members.JAPANESE INTERVENTION,in connection with a telegram received from General Bridgessaying that President Wilson still demurred,in spite of theefforts of General Berthelot and Monsieur Delaney, the french ambassador at Tokio, to the idea of Japanese intervention,LORD MILNER urged the necessity of action, and pointed outthat the Japanese were probably prepared to go now with veryslight encouragement, although he considered they wantedsomething better than a demand for a series of pledges withregard to their intentions, unaccompanied by any promise of support.   He thought it urgent to have another try at the americans.
THE PRIME MINISTER urged the necessity of weighingvery carefully the danger of setting Russia against us.This was one of the cases where a mistake might prove fatal.If Germany once got the gigantic man-power of Russia intoher hands, the Allies would be bankrupt .    In his opinion, theright thing would have been to have utilised the Gzecho-Slov-aks as a nucleus of a democratic anti-Bolshevist movement in siberia, which could have formed a Government, and then in-invited the Japanese in to help.   If Siberia was once in hand it might be possible to save Russia as well, especially asSiberia controlled the food supply.   What was needed was some-body who could help organise and inspire suoh a movement,someone like Chinese Gordon, with a streak of genius in him.In this connection the names of General Khox and Mr. LeslieUrquhart were suggested, the idea being that they, with cer-tain other Offioers, should make their way into Siberia ascivilians, with plenty of money at their disposal, revertingto military rank if the development of the situation made that desirable.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,June 19, 1918.
