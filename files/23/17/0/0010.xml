C Tills Document is the property of HisBritannic Majesty&apos;s Government).I E T.SEE CABINET.NOTES OP A CONVERSATION at 10 Downing Street, 3.W.,on MONDAY,  JUNE 10,  1918, at 11.15 a.m.Present: -THE PRIME MINISTER fin the Chair):The Rt, Hon.  the Viscount Milner,G.C.B., G.G0M0G., Secretary of Statefor Mar:General Sir H.H-oWiison, K.CB. , D.S.O.,.Chief of the Imperial General StaffsThe Rt.  Hon.  Sir Auckland Geddes, K.CB. , M.p. ,Minister of National Service;(For &quot;Man-Power&quot; only).Lto-Col. L.S.Amery, M.p.,THE MILITARY SITUATION.GENERAL WILSON reported that the news so far was not un-satisfactory.    The French claimed to have punished the Ger-mans heavily, and though they had pushed in a depth of some,000 yards on a frontage of 30,000 yards,  they had very difficia.lt country in front of them.    Only 11 German divisions had been identified so far,  including, however,  two of thebest from prince Rupprecht&apos;s reserve.    He was not inclined to think that this was the big attack, or, at any rate, theonly attack.    Three new German divisions had been reportedIn or immediately behind ths Bailleul, and he suspected theGerman plan might be to try and draw away our reserves both to the North and to the South before making a decisiveattack on the Arras-Amiens front.    General Foch himself was
rather inclining towards that opinion, at any rate, he had warned General petain to be prepared to send divisions north-wards in rear of the British line.Generally speaking, he foresaw another two months of great anxiety.    If we could hang on approximately on our presentline till the beginning of August, that anxiety would begin to diminish, and would be gone by October.LOAD MILNER reported that he had discussed the questionof falling back to St. Omer with. General plumer, who was very strongly opposed to the idea from the point of view of its effect on the moral of his own troops, and more particularly of the Belgians.    He certainly did not consider it necessary,*as far at any rate as the situation on his own front was con-cerned.AIEERIOAE GO OPERATE OH.GENERAL WILSON raised the question of the allotment of suchAmerican troops as arrived in France during the present month.THE PRIMES MINISTER and LORE MILNER agreed that,  in view ofthe withdrawal of the 5 divisions previously sent us, allAmericans arriving in June up to a total of 10 divisions inany case would come to us. // With regard to the replacementsfor these divisions,  GENERAL WILSON mentioned that largecamps were being formed in England, as the area immediatelybehind sh our line in France was getting too congested.    Withregard to the shortage of horses and rolling kitchens, hethought this could be surmounted.    A reduction was beingmade of the horses in the artillery wagons to meet this nee-essity, and as regards the cooking, they could do with dixiesfor the time being.THE NEW &quot;B&quot; DIVISIONS.GENERAL WILSON stated that,  in view of Sir Douglas HaigTsreluctance to make up divisions from the 60,000 &quot;B&quot; men we propose to send from England, he had ordered Sir Douglas Haig
to send 3 cadre divisions over to England, with a view to making up the divisions on this side.    Eo very large extratransport requirement was involved in bringing back the cadresand he thought the divisions could be organised more quicklyon this side.    He hoped,  in fact,  to be able to send the firstdivision back within a fortnight of the bringing over of thecadre, and the others soon after.    He proposed to utilisesome of  Che trained men who might be released from ireland to stiffen these divisions.general .E.P TROOP -. POP THE EASg.GrEHEHAL iWELSON mentioned that the Divisional headquarters of the German 217th Division had sailed for Batoum, and Gen-eral Macdonogh considered that probably the whole of the di-vision was going to the Caucasus.ITALY.GENERAL WILSON reported that there were no signs of -any german troops going to Italy.    He was awaiting a telegram fromGeneral Diaz as to the latter plan.IIQRAL 32IMUL.ATTS POP THE TROOPS.  .THE PRIME MINISTER drew attention to the skilful way inwhich the Germans made use of any successes they gained bycirculating them among the whole of their forces in order tokeep up their spirits, and asked whether enough of the samesort was done in our Army?   He thought a great deal might bemade of the steady arrival of the Americans, and of any in-cidents which showed that they were good fighting troops.    Notroops liked to feel that they had an empty battlefield behind them.CONCLUSION.GENERAL WILSON -undertook to look into the matter, butsuggested that our Officers, and possibly some of ourmen had got into the way of paying more attention tothe enemy communiques than to any information circulatedby our own Authorities.
INFORMATION TO THE PRESS.THE PRIME MINISTER drew attention to the annoyance whichhad been caused in France by press statements apparently bas-ed on the statements of the General Staff,  to the effectthat the French troops had. not   ; fought well.GENERAL .7ILS0N pointed out that,  in the case of the &quot;star&quot;newspaper,  they had put in the very opposite of what they hadbeen told, and that it was impossible to forestall that sort of abuse.THE PRIME MINISTER, however, still considered that not suf-ficient care was exercised in these statements, and referredto a document from the same source supplied to Mr. Barnes forthe purpose of a speech, which had fortunately &quot;been suppress-ed in time..   CONOLUSIQ E.LOME MILNER undertook to let the prime Minister seecopies of the actual statements made to the presson beaalf of the General Staff.MAN-P0;-/ER.THE Prime MINISTER read some extracts from a letter whichhad been sent to Lord Burnham, purporting to give the viewsof the French Government, which reproduced, in exaggeratedform, the current French view that we still maintain an enor-mous force in this country, and set up an unduly high stand-ard of fitness, by which we limit the numbers available for france.GENERAL PILSON mentioned that Colonel Roure, the French 0&quot;f-officer who had come- over to investigate the matter&apos;, had, he understood, been pleased with what he had seen.    He gathered that the Adjutant General was working hard to make it clear to the French that these large numbers were not, as a matterof fact, available in the Home Army.SIR AUCKLAND GEDDE5 said that he had just been conferringwith Colonel Roure, and his French colleague, and found them4.
S, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.?Jane 10, 1918.very hurt at the reception they had met with at the War Of-fice, and which he thought must have been due to some misunder-standing.    Their impression so far was that a good many men could still be got out of the Home Forces.    They a/ere part-particularly struck by the large numbers of A. men (about 74,000)who were unavailable as being either in cadres or undergoingspecialist training.    With regard to the question of men incivil life, he had gone through corresponding classes of needs in England and France, and shown that the proportions retain-ed in civil life, both in France and in England, were substan-tially the same.    The French Officers had not had the slightsest idea of the extent of our Naval requirements,  or of our naval casualties.    They had also begun, by crediting thiscountry with nearly 2 million mere males than it possessed,which accounted for much of the mistaken impression withwhich they had started.THE PHIIIE MINISTER thought it would be a good thing-if he saw the French Officers himself after they had gone more fully into the matter.
