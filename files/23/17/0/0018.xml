and transport.    What, he wished to have clearly agreed upon wasthat the present arrangement, by which five American divisions were in training with the British Army, should be regularly main-tained.   The Divisions need not always be the same Divisions,and if Sir Douglas Haig was able to arrange the training facili-ties it might be possible to ask for more than five Divisions.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that we had equipped thelast lot of American Divisions, who had left us taking our trans-port with theis.    Was it to be understood that we were always to equip the American Divisions in this fashion and then lose thetransport?    That was obviously a matter on which a definite ar-rangement was desirable.    Similarly, he wished something could bearranged about trie training of surplus American gunners with british and French batteries.Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.,
