(War Cabinet 418).EUTURB MILITARY POLICY.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he would like to have a pio-ture of the situation next year, as it appeared to general wilson.    At the present time we were having the utmostdifficulty in working up the Allied forces on the Western
front to an equality with the enemy.    Gould General Wilson,he asked, see the time when the Allies would once more be asstrong as 3 to 2 against the enemy?GENERAL WILSON said that the situation presented itselfto him somewhat as follows:- We had before us two months of real anxiety.    Provided we could surmount these two monthsthey would be followed by two more months of serious, thoughdiminishing anxiety.    By the end of September we might hope,if all went well,  to reach a time when our anxiety for thesecurity of the Allied position on the Western front hadpractically disappeared.    We should then have to devote our-selves to building up forces on the Western front for a tre-mendous and crushing blow at the enemy, which would takemuch time.    It would be a great mistake to launch our blow un-til it had been fully prepared.     ./e must indulge in no opera-tions of the Passchendaele type in this period.    Consequently,between the time when our anxieties had been relieved and wewould be able to strike a decisive blow on the Jestern front,a long period must exist.    Re was examining the situation onthe basis that this period might be employed for striking ablow in one or other of the outlying theatres.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that the Germans could not afford to allow the Turks to be anocked out.GENERAL .71LSON agreed, and said that one of the objects of our blows in the outlying theatres would be to draw theenemy from the Western front.TEE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that by that time the ship-ping position ought to be again restored, which would renderthis policy the more practicable.GENERAL WILSON agreed and pointed out that the Indian Gov-ernment were raising 91 new battalions, which would facili-tate operations of the kind he had in view.    He hoped that,when the first rush of infantry and machine-gunners had beenS.
brought from the United States of America, he might be ableto bring a few additional railway companies to France,  there-by releasing a few extra railway battalions for preparing our communications in the outlying theatres.0 0 A 0 I U S I 0 If.GENERAL WILSON undertook to give the PrimeMinister a Memorandum on the whole subject.ITALYoGENERAL WILSON drew attention to a telegram he had re-ceived that morning from General Gavan, indicating that theItalian Intelligence Department believed that 10 German di-visions were being concentrated on the Italian front, whichhad caused the Italians to desist from their proposed of-fensive.    General Macdonogh did not confirm this report, andbelieved it to be very unlikely,  and was sending a telegram in this sense to Italy.    GENERAL WILSON pointed out that thiswas not the first occasion on which the Italians had takenalarm at such rumours, which was deplorable.THE V.ESTERN FRONT.GENERAL.WILSON considered that the enemy had most to gain by postponing his attack till the first fortnight in June, asby these means he would be able to rest sufficiently for a renewed offensive the last of the divisions which had beenknocked about in the Ypres-battle.    If he attacked on a verylarge front, without very great depth, the attack would not last more than a fortnight, but by shortening the front of attack he might prolong it.    On a front from Arras to Tillers-Brettoneux, namely, 60 kilometres, with 100 divisions avail-able, he could ma 6 the original attack with 40 divisions, with  reliefs of SO divisions apiece behind, and in this case the attack might be prolonged for quite a month.hi tehall Gardens,  S.W..,May 27, 1918.3.
