Unless President Wilson sanctionedt *effective Japanese intervention in Siberia quickly, he feared weshould probably have to withdraw General Poole*s force.   Meanwhile,the Americans had not yet answered our specific request for aregiment and certain other items for the defence of Murmansk.west-1 FRONT. GENERAL WILSON&apos;s report was subsequently repeated atImperial War Cabinet 17a-1-
AMERICAN 00-OPBRATION.THE PRIMS MINISTER stated that the last telegram withreferenoe to General Pershing1s intention to train all the remain-ing American troops himself was a complete reversal of the wholegreement arrived at.    General Poch apparently was not himselfclear how the position stood.    It was essential that we should take action.LORD MILNER said that a very careful answer would have tobe given, and we should have to know clearly what we wanted.    Hisown idea was that we should insist that there should always be fiveAmerican Divisions training with us, and that as soon as one lotwas taken away another should be sent to replace it.   That was pro-bably as much as we required in the general interests of the Alii-ance.Sir M. HANKEY mentioned that he had just heard from MrGraeme Thomson that he now had shipping available to bring over3SO,000 Americans during July and August, but did not know whetherthe men would be there.Lord Milner undertook to discuss thematter with General Wilson, and toprepare a careful reply to general pershing,MAN-POWER.LORD MILNER said that he felt obliged to send a telegram to Mo clemencoau , putting our immediate military effort in its most favourable light, drawing attention more particularly to what we had done to re-constitute our Divisions, to send men over to france , and to comb out the Army in Prance itself.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had been discussing the ratio of combatants to rationed strength with Colonel Roure, whohad criticised our Air Force and Artillery and Labour battalions in this respect.GENERAL WILSON pointed out that our Air Force was betterthan the French, and able to keep a much larger proportion of its-2-
machines in the air, chiefly because of the larger supply ofmechanics available to overhaul and tune up the machines,,It was generally agreed that there was some happy mediumbetween the French inadequacy of personnel to look after the machines and our abundance.General Wilson undertook to go into thematter with General Sykes.GENER&amp;L WILSON mentioned that he had tried to get 3,000men out of the anti-aircraft establishment in Great Britain, butthat General  Robertson had refused to be responsible  for the defenceof Great Britain if that were done.LORD MILNER stated that the Artillery figures in Francecertainly seemed very high, the total given being 307,000,,GENERAL WILSON explained that these included a consider-able number of men in light repair-shops, ete*, who were doing workfor the Artillery that was being done in France by people in plainclothes.GENERAL WILSON suggested that probably 100,000 men couldbe got out of the Navy if that were properly combed out *   He thought the Navy ought to be obliged to give a return.Sir MaHANKEY mentioned that the War Cabinet had already decided three times to have such a return from the Navy.    nothing but a definite order would get the return.THE PRIME MINISTER said that Sir E.Geddes was by no meanshappy with the Parliamentary side of his present position, andmight resign if too hard pressed.    He thought, meanwhile, a gooddeal could be done with the Air Force and the Artillery.Sir M. Hankey undertook to produce a return showing our war effort in all branches.Sir R.BORDERS CRITICISMS.THE PRIME MINISTER mentioned that he had been talking toGeneral Currie, and gathered from him a general impression ofwooden-headedness at Headquarters, and a reluctance to sanction
things like light railways, wiring of communication trenches,  etc.,which all proved to be essential afterwards.   He had also laid stress on the inferiority of our work in wiring and trenching, and &amp;s theactual inferiority of the wire used by us as compared with the Ger-man wire.    THE PRIME MINISTER thought it was impossible to leavethe criticisms raised by Sir R. Borden, which would probably be endorsed by Mr Hughes, undealt with.    Serious notice would have tobe taken of them.    His own idea was to suggest that the matter should be gone into by a small Committee,  consisting of the PrimeMinisters and the Secretary of State for War, with the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff as his Military Adviser.LORD MILNER entirely agreed with this suggestion.Whitehall Gardens, S,f.lMJune 14, 1918.
