WAR CABINET.II NOTES OP A CONVERSATION held at 10 Downing Street,I S.W., on MONDAY, fUNE 17, 1918, at 11.15 a.m.Present;.THE PRIME MINISTER fin the Chair);The Rto Hon. the Viscount Milner,G.C.B., G.CM.G., Secretary ofState for War:General Sir H.H.Wilson, K.C.B., D.S.O.,Chief of the Imperial General Staff:Lieutenant-Colonel Sir M.P.A.Hankey, K.3.B.,Secretary, War CabinetsLieutenant-Colonel L.S.Amery, MoP.ITALY.GENERAL WILSON said that the news as far as it went was good.    The foot-holds which the Austrians had secured acrossthe Piave at the Montello and elsewhere had been reduced,and there was the possibility of their being thrown back intothe Piave.   In that case it might be possible for the Ital-ians to take in hand the postponed attack on the Asiago. Al-together 20 divisions had been identified, all of them exact-ly where our information had placed them.,   Stoxs mBxm. &amp; more divisions 9 which had recently been engaged in suppressingriots in Bohemia, had also arrived on the Italian frontolo
MAN-POWER.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that another relative state-ment of the strength of the combatant troops on both sidesin France should be made out.    The last statement made had left 10 British divisions out of account altogether as knock-ed out by the fighting, but had made no corresponding dedue-tion from the German strength.    His own calculation was that within a fortnight or so the Allied combatant strength inFrance would be very little, if at all, short of the Germancombatant strength.LORD MILKER expressed doubt whether the more recently ar-rived American divisions could fairly be reckoned at theirnumerical strength, more especially as they had no guns.There was also the very uncertain factor of what the realFrench strength was.   Monsieur Clemenceau had recently writ-ten to him to say that the French divisions contained only6,000 infantry.GENERAL WILSON suggested that, from the military point ofview, the sound rule was to give the enemy the advantage ofthe doubt in one1s calculations.THE PRIME MINISTER said he preferred basing his caloula^tion on the actual facts.    Our danger was in rushing to ex-tremes.   Last year we had always assumed that the germans were collapsing.AMERICAN COOPERATION.GENERAL WILSON referred to the fact that &amp; of the american divisions,which were due to be sendr down to the Vosges, werebeing put into the line by General Foch near Meaux, and, asfar as he understood, by battalions.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that General Fooh had, inten-tionally or unintentionally, &quot;done&quot; us in the matter.
LORD MILEER explained that he had been talking to an Of-fioer on General Pershing*s staff, who reported that,whatbetween the British saying that they were the only people whooould trained the Americans, and the French saying that onlythey could do it, as the British had proved their incapacityat the Somme, General Pershing was so confused that he thoughtit safest to train his troops himself.   As far as he himself was concerned LORD MILKER said he would be quite happy if wealways have 5 or 6 American divisions with the British Army0GENERAL POOH&apos;S STAFF.THE PRIME MINISTER reported that this same American Off i-cer had drawn attention to the absence of any proper Staff at general Eooh?s Headquarters.    This had been responsible for considerable confusion, more particularly in transportationarrangements.GENERAL WILSON agreed, and considered that the simplestthing would be if General foch  would take over General Petain?staff, more particularly on the railway and transportation side.THE PRIME MINISTER made it clear that it would not meet thecase if General foch  merely made use of a staff that still re-mainsd General Retain1s, and was biassed in the interests ofGeneral Retain&quot;s Army.   We were entitled to ask Monsieur Olem-enceau that General foch  should have an independent Staff.GENERAL WILSON explained that he certainly meant that if general Eooh took over General Retain&apos;s Staff the latter wouldhave to fit himself out with another Staff.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that as regards questions liketransportation there ought also to be a British representative on the Staff.OONOLUSIONoGENERAL WILSON undertook to send the Prime minister a draft for a letter to be sent to Monsieur clemenceau.So
VERSAILLES.COLONEL AMERY suggested that what was really required wasthat Versailles should exercise relatively to General Eoohthe functions which the Chief of the Imperial General Staffexercised relatively to a British commander-in-Chief.THE PRIME MINISTER concurred, but expressed the view thatVersailles had been let down considerable, and needed strengthsening and being taken more seriouslyo&amp;, Whitehall Gardens, S*W.,June 17, 1918o
