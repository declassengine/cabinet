L.So Amery, MoPoALLIED INTERVENTION IN SIBERlAoTHE PRIME MINISTER drew attention to the latest telegrams from Mr* Lockhart urging the dangers of further delay in thematter of intervention and suggested that their contents oughtto be communicated to President Wilson0   It was important inview of all the arguments from the other side which were for-warded to the President, to keep on pouring the right stuff intoPresident WilsonoLORD ROBERT CECIL explained that these telegrams were sentto Lord Reading in any case and that he no doubt used his discre-P r e s e h t:lo
tion in communicating them to the President.MR BALEOUR undertook to see that thesubstance of these particular telegramswas immediately conveyed to President Wilson.LORD ROBERT CECIL explained the substance of a conversation which he had had with the Japanese Ambassadorwho had communicated to him the Japanese reply to the american proposal..       This reply had accepted the proposal but hadreserved the Japanese Government1s right to increase the contingent, as the Japanese public would regard the strictlimitation of their contingent in the manner proposed astreating their motives with suspicion, and had also pointedout that it was impossible on military grounds to lay downbeforehand exactly how many troops would be required fora military operation.     The Ambassador had explained thatas a matter of fact the Japanese Government intended to sendone division of 12,000 men to Viadivostock at once, andanother division a little later for the purpose of guardingthe railway.     He added that the Japanese proposed shortlyputting forward a decla^ion of their dis-interestedness.In the course of the conversation a further telegramcame in from Lord Reading stating that the United Statesregarded the Japanese answer not as an acceptance but as a counter proposal.     He considered that the Japanese pointwith regard to the restriction of numbers was not so serious,and might be met wxkh by the despatch of more American troops.On the other hand, the Japanese demand for greater freedom from the detailed restrictions imposed in the american proposal was more seriously viewed by the President.   he did not consider the President would give way on this point,and thought that in the end the Japanese would accept theAmerican formula.    This formula, which implied that theJapanese should merely be there to hold territory or railrrheads behind the czecho-Slovaks, could not be carried out
in practice as a military operation, as the President himself was beginning to realise.She PRIME MINISTER pointed out that whether this attitude on the part of the United States would involve delayor not before an agreement was arrived at, it was essentialto send whatever forces were available to help the Szecho-Slovaks at once.   He drew attention to a telegram from Sir GoGreene (No. 804) giving the relative forces of the Bolsheviksand Ozecho-Slovaks in Eastern Siberia, which showed that theformer were considerably superior in numbers and equipment.The Prime Minister asked what measures were being taken to expedite the despatch of Canadian troops which had already beendiscussed.GENERAL WILSON mentioned that the British Battalion onway toits/Vladivostock would arrive there on August 2nd.     As regardsthe Caralian troops, arrangements had been carried on withGeneral Mewburn, who was, however, a little annoyed because,during his absence in Prance, a War Office telegram on the matter had, in the course of the ordinary routine, been transmittedfrom the Colonial Office to the Governor-General instead of to himself.SIR ROBERT BORLEN agreed that General. Mewburn had beenannoyed by the incident.     He had no wish himself to make a pointof it but he understood that Canada was to send 3 battalions and some Artillery and Engineers.MR. POLEY explained that there was shipping for some10,000 men in the Pacific which could be collected at Vancouver.Some life it was, however, at the China end of the journey andmight take a month or more to reach Vancouver.   There ought,however, at any one moment, to be at least two ships at or nearVancouver, and with these it ought to be possible to get away
three Battalions in a gew days. The actual journey to Vladivos-took took 16 days.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that as the matter wasone of great urgency Sir Robert Borden might take the whole mat-ter in hand on behalf of the Imperial War Cabinet, givingsuch instructions as he thought suitable both to GeneralMewburn and to the Ministry of Shipping.SIR ROBERT BORDEN undertook to take thematter in hand at once in consultation withGeneral Mewburn.GENERAL WILSON undertook to nominate atonce a War Office representative to be at sir robert BordenJs disposal for any informationhe might require from the War Office point ofview.MR FOLEY was instructed to ascertain atonce what shipping was at or near Vladivostockand communicate this information to Sir robert borden, and generally to hold himself at sir robert Borden&quot;s disposal with regard to thisbusine ss .SIR ROBERT BORDEN asked whether any awkwardness might occur if the Canadian troops arrived at Viadivostock beforethe American-Japanese discussions were over and before anyproclamation had been issued.It was pointed out that in any case one British battalionwould already have arrived, and that the Japanese independentproclamation of disinterestedness would probably also havebeen published by then.A short discussion followed on the Draft Allied proclama-tion which had been framed by Dr. Harold Williams, Sir GeorgeBuchanan and Mr. Okulitch in language appropriate to theRussian taste.AMERICAN CO-OPERATION ON THE WESTERN FRONT.THE PRIME MINISTER drew attention to a telegram from lord Reading stating that the Americans were not likely to beable to furnish more than 80 divisions in 1919 sinstead of
2, Whitehall Gardens,   S*W.July 27, 1918oLORD MILNER added that even with regard to these theywould have to be dependent upon us foi- shipping, and thatthere were very serious difficulties about horses and othermatters^THE PRIME MINISTER asked, in reference to recent tele-grams from General Milne, what was General Wilson&apos;s opinionaboiit the contemplated September offensive in Macedonia ?GENERAL WILSON pointed out that General Mine was ratherin favour of something being done, or at any rate of our being prepared and in a position to do something if a favourable opportunity offered.       This, in General Milne&quot;s opinion,involved sending out more troops, ammunition, etc., in orderto bring the force up to fighting pitch.     There would bemore Greek troops available by the end of September, and nodoubt the Erench meant mainly to use the Serbians and GreekSoThere was some discussion as to the direction in which theproposed offensive might take place0It was pointed out that the direction which would givethe greatest results, i.ee ,/ advance up the Vardar valley,presented the greatest difficulties from the tactical point of viand enable the enemy to bring up re-inforcements from germany with the least possible delayo
