AMERICAN COOPERATION.GENERAL WILSON said that he had ascertained from EieldMarshal Haig that by June 1st, there would only be 3 Americanbattalions in the line, and these for instruction only*    Hehad received a letter from General Bridges which indicated that there was very considerable chaos in the American Milit-.ary Administration, and it was very difficult to ascertainfacts and figures.THE PRIME MINISTER said,he 7ks&amp; on his visits, hxe had found G.H.Q., rather inclined to belittle the Americanbattal-i ons. /GENERAL WILSON said the same applied to General Pooh. Hehad four United States divisions practically under his orders,but he was only using one in the battle and orm one brigadeI jUwas at present in the line,somewhere in the region of Mont-didier.(This Document is the Property of HisBritannic Majesty1s Government).S B 0 R S T.WAR CABINET.NOTES Off A CONYERSJLTION at 10 DOWNING STREET,  S.W. ,01 THURSDAY, MAY 16, 1918, at 11 a.m.Present;-THE PRIME MINISTER (in the Chair)&apos;.The Rt.  Hon. the Viscount Milner,G.G.B., G.C.M.G., Secretary of Statefor War.General Sir H.H.Wilson, K.C.B., D.S.O.,Ohief of the Imperial General Staff:Lieutenant-Colonel Sir MoP.A.Hankey, E.C.B.,Secretary, War -Cabinet.
MAN-POSER.IRELAND.GENERAL WILSON said he had received a letter from&quot; GeneralEoch ashing him to send over more men.    The principal untouch-ed source he could think of was Ireland, but this depended on what the Government1s policy was to be.    If the government did not intend to enforce Conscription he might be able todraw as many as ,20,000 trained men from Ireland.THE PRIME MINISTER said that this depended on the resultof field Marshal French1s Proclamation on Friday.    The firstthing was to enforce the law.    Only yesterday he had seen Mr.Arthur Lynch, M.P., who was passionately pro-French, and con-sequent ly passionately pro-Ally-, and who had lately seen agood deal of the Sinn Eeiners in Ireland.    He said that the/Sinn Eeiners were rather tete monte.  They really thought thatthey could beat the British Army, not by regular fighting,but by guerilla methods.    Side by side with a certain child-islmess they had a lot of natural cunning, and Mr. Lynch had thought that this might easily be under-estimated.    They didnot intend to fight in the towns, but to withdraw at once tothe country where they had lots of clever guerilla leaders.They had a large number of rifles, having received small con-signments steadily during the last year or two.    Mr. Lynchhad not mentioned chat they had machine-guns, but he had beenconfident that they would fight.    Mr. Lynch had thought thatthe insurrection might be delayed for two months, although itmight come off within a fortnight.    THE PRIME MINISTER hadbeen careful to tell him nothing of our counter plans.GENERAL ATLSON said that, apart from Ireland, the onlysource from which men could be sent immediately, were 46,000elderly men used for fatigue duties in training camps, fromwhich perhaps 20,000 might be taken.CONCLUSION.(1) General Wilson undertook to write to Lord French on thesubject and communicate what the Prime Minister had told him, without mentioning the source of his information:
(Z) It was agreed that, in the circumstances, fightingmen should not be withdrawn from Ireland until theresult of lord French1s Proclamation was seen.THE HIGEBR GOiAAVND       ME QUTHWAIIE&apos; B QUESTION.At LORD MIMERlS suggestion it was agreed thatThe answer to Mr. Outhwaite&apos;s question in regardto the Higher Command should be that no change hastaken place or is contemplated.&quot;THE MOREING -031&quot;&apos;.GENERAL WILSON drew attention to the articles in &quot;TheHorning Post&quot;.    He said that this journal was much read bythe younger Staff Officers.    It did a good deal of harm, asit was engendering hatred of the Prime Minister and the Gov-ernment .LORD MILNER considered steps would have to be taken to stop this.    If a warning was of no value It might be necess-ary to stop the paper.THE PRIME MINISTER said that if colonel Hepington were a German Agent he could hardly assist the enemy more.    He wascontinually speaking of the possibility of an invasion of thiscountry, which would tend to keep us from sending men to Erance.Similarly, he was making an outcry about sending the youngmen out as reinforcements, and this would have a similar tend-ency$    he was suggesting an invasion of France through Switzer-land, which would tend to Induce the French to divert troops;and finally he was making trouble between Staff Officers andRegimental Officers.THE MILITARY SITUATION ON THE WESTERN FRONT.GENERAL WILSON said that the first requisite for the Ger-mans was good weather.    By this time they probably had from50 to 55 divisions ready for the offensive.    In 10 days or a fortnight they might have 70.    They would have to balance theadvantages to them of delay in preparing and bringing up newdivisions against the disadvantage that time would enable us3.
to bring up American troops and to dig and wire our defences.&quot;Fortunately, the Germans did not know how slowly the american troops were coming along.    For a proper roulenient the Alliesrecpaired no less than 156 divisions, as he had stated in hislecture on the Versailles war game,    This was why we so ur-gently needed men to keep our divisions in being.    At present we had 9 divisions entirely out of action.    When the divisionsdropped to 3,000 infantry, they were merely kept as cadres,and the infantry were used as drafts.THE PRIME MINISTER said that there were 4 points on whichhe felt that he himself and the War Cabinet ought to be satis-fied.    The points were as follows:-(1) Whether the less efficient Corps and Divisional Com-manders had yet been weeded out?(2) Whether the positions behind the lines were reallybeing p repa red?(3) Whether care had been taken to provide against pos-itions being abandoned by retiring troops withouta blow?(4) Whether proper arrangements had been made for the de-molition of bridges,  culverts, Ac?He was very anxious that we should not fail in the West be-cause the Government had shirked the unpleasantness of insist-ing on being informed on these matters.    He wa-s inclined tothink it was part of the duty of the Chief of the Imperial Gen-eral Staff, on behalf of the War Cabinet, to embassy see that these things &quot;were done, and he thought he would be quite justifiedin making inquiries.    Only on the previous day an Officer whohad on another occasion given good advice had told him thatthe digging behind the lines was, to a large extent, a sham.THE CORPS, DIVISIONAL, AND BRIGADE COMMANDS.GENERAL WILSON said that he believed about 20 changeshad been made in Brigades and Divisions.    The practical diffi-culty was that neither he nor Lord Milner really knew who thegood men were.    They had to depend on reports0LORD MILNER agreed in this, and said that he and General
Wilson were perpetually trying to find, out about the men in command.GENERAL WILSON said that an Officer like General plumer,for example, would at once remove anyone in whom he had no confidence.conclusions on n.GENERAL WILSON undertook to give the Prime Minister alist of the changes that had been made in the Corps,Divisional, and Brigade Commands.POSITIONS BEHIND IKE LINES.LORD MILNER said that General Wilson had already sentexperts, on behalf of the War Cabinet, to examine the waterprotection behind, the lines.GENERAL WILSON said that they tod ejgam&amp;ed-/hot only the-f^5^/areas, but the potentialities of the various rivers.C 0 N C L U S I 0 N.After some discussion, It was agreed that:-Lord Milner should arrange for Sir Ernest Moirto visit the Array, and advise as to whether thelabour was being applied, in the best possible way,and whether labour-saving devices were being usedto the utmost in constructing trenches behind, thelines, and generally to report on the work being done on defensive positions.Lord Milner undertook to consider whether GeneralStewart should accompany Sir Ernest Moir, or whetherIt would be better to employ him independently witha view to getting the most out of the labour in Erance,THE MANNING OE REAR POSITIONS.GENERAL WILSON said, that he had received a letter fromGeneral Lawrence about the manning of the Third line trenches,which really answered, the question the Prime Minister had ask-ed.    General Lawrence had explained that the British divisionsholding an average of 5,000 yards ef\)iece could not be organ-ised in sufficient depth to man the Third line trenches aswell as the outpost line and the main position.    It had eonse-quently been arranged that the French divisions in reserves should man the Third line trenches, and if the British troops were compelled to fall back they would pass, through the /Thirdlines manned by the French,        ^^&amp;^^/^^-wk &apos;u^e
THE BLOWIHG UP OF BRIDGES AND CbMVVERTS.THE PRIME MINISTER said that we ought not to stand inter-ferenoe with the French in the destruction of bridges and ctil-verts.    If they tried to prevent their destruction, we oughtto reply that it was necessary for the safety of the Army.GENERAL maurice.LORD MILKER read a draft of a letter he proposed to send to General maurice impressing on him the great importance inhis journalistic work of not giving information to the enemy.THE PRIME MINSTER agreed that the letter was a very suit-able one to send.MEXICO.GENERAL WILSON, adverting to Mr. Half our rs remarks -  G&apos;.TAM.it. the General staff s Paper on Mexico (G.T.WAMM..... ) said that,as a matter of fact, the General Staff had been in frequentcommunication with the Foreign Office on the subject, and Mr.Balfour had himself taken the Chair at several Meetings todiscuss this question.THE COMMAND OF THE HOME FORCES *The proposal, made on the previous day, that:-General Monro should be appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Home Forces, and that his placeshould be taken in India by General Robertson,  .was agreed to.Lord Milner undertook to is communicate this in-forrnation to his colleagues, either personallyand independently, or at the War Cabinet on thefollowing day, after which he would see the King.GENERAL WILSON said that he had taken over, as a temporarily-ary measure, the responsibilities of the Command of the home forces *THE WESTERN FRONT.THE DISPERSION OF BRITISH AMONG FRENCH DIVISIONS.There was a long discussion on questions connected withthe dispersion of the British divisions among French divisions
In the course of this discussion,  GENERAL WILSON explain-ed the reason why it was necessary to send British divisions,to hold part of the French front.    General Poch, in spite of representations that had been made to him,  insisted on the&quot;brunt oi the fighting being taken by British divisions. this did not mean that he was not using French divisions, but he did not put the French divisions in until the British divi-sions had been practically Allocked out.    At the present time there were only 4 British divisions that had not been engagedin the battle.    General Wilson had recently suggested thatGeneral Pooh should relieve some of the British divisions onthe III. Army front with French divisions, as an attach was expected on that front.    General Fooh, however, had declined.French divisions were in reserve,  and, in due course, Brit-ish divisions, as they were knocked out, would be relieved.The result of this was that, in order to provide for a - properroulement among the French divisions, we had to take over a portion of the French line.    GENERAL WILSON did not disputethat &quot;this was an Inevitable corollary to the policy of bring-ing up French divisions to support the attack on our front.One point, however, on which he thought we ought to insistwas that the British divisions should not be dotted aboutamong the French divisions, but should be grouped together.For example, we had lately taken over a portion of the Frenchline South of the Oise, on a Corps front of 4 divisions, andto this he offered no objection.    The opposite course ofdotting the divisions about singly along the French line was open to grave objection, and,  in his opinion,  if persisted in, might eventually break the Alliance.    It was bound to leadto friction.    Every point of contact between the two Armieswas apt to be a point of friction.    As long as the divisions were together, they could be supplied by the British supplyServices.    But in the case of single divisions,  it was diffi-cult to justify a separate line of supply.    The French would
then insist on supplying them, and this was almost hound to,lead to trouble.    Even if at first the Erench gave the troops the supplies to which they were accustomed, they would prob-ably get into the practice of giving Erench supplies, towhich our men were unaccustomed.    The French troops were ac-customed to different supplies at different hours , and thewhole system was different.    Consequently, he thought we ought to insist on grouping those divisions which were hold-N.P.ing part of the French line./ A second point on which general wilson laid some stresfsTwsws -4&amp;e ri^k--^f-unduly mixing/ourdivisions with the French/.    He had no doubts of the bonafides either of General Foch or Ivl.  Clemenceau, who simply de-sired to win the battle, hut either of these might any daybe superseded, and their places taken by men of entirely different calibre.    In these circumstances, a state of af-fairs which was quite secure now might become a serious dan-ger.    If the French could induce us to allow them to supplydivisions scattered through their lines they would insist on controlling the ports through which the supplies were brought, and they might even want to control the merchant ships which brought the supplies.    There were tendencies Inthis direction which ought to be resisted.    General pershing,&apos;was abetting the French in their aims by his desire for apooling of all resources.    The reason for this was that thenumber of troops he could feed by the French Southern ports_____was limited, and consequently he wished to get a part use ofthe Northern ports for the American Army,  in order that he might thereby avoid putting American troops in the british army said increase the strength of the American Army.Another point on which GENERAL WILS02T insisted was thatBritish divisions sent to occupy part of the French line,when filled up, should be brought back to the British Army.He insisted very strongly on the preservation of the british army as a separate entity.
;     18LORD MILKER supported General Wilson&quot; s arguments againstthe dispersion of divisions, -particularly on the ground thatwe should not abandon our control over their supplies.    Noone had been a stauncher advocate of Allied cooperation than he, but he could not countenance mspfaMnaaj handing over supply to the French.    As an instance, he pointed out the need of having our own hospitals.    There would be a great outcry ifany breakdown of French medical arrangements resulted in suf-fering to oar troops.    He could foresee very serious frictionif the supply were made over to the French.    He, therefore,intended to resist the pressure of the French, and to insist on the creation of a British Supply Depot in the Argonne.Sooner or later he thought the Prime Minister would have tobe prepared to tackle M. Clemenceau on the question.THB PRIME MINISTER urged that the first consideration was to win the battle; nothing must be done whiSh   hand!cap-ped General Foch in this respect.    If General Foch wished to relieve a particular French division which had particularcharacteristics, it might be difficult for him to 6.0 so ifhe was debarred from replacing it by a British division.  Ifit involved a re-Shuffling of divisions,  it might involvedelay.    General Foch, he pointed out, probably, rightly orwrongly, regarded the French Army as better than the British.Consequently, he intended the British to break the brunt ofthe attack, reserving his best troops for the later stages.The Americans would not be here in large numbers before theautumn, and consequently if the British Army were,$0 a great extent, knocked out in the next stage of the battle,as alarge part of it would be, the brunt of the fighting in July,August and September would devolve upon the French.    He con-sidered it very important that they should be in a fit con-dition to sustain this effort, and nothing should be done which would handicap General Foch in this respect.    For his part he hoped that the French would take a very big share in
the battle, as he did not want the British Army to be so re-duced that next year we should find ourselves the third Mil-itary Power on the Western front.    As regards the possibilityof an alternative French Government to AA  clemenceau, he point-ed out that any successor would probably be easier to dealwith, and he, therefore,  did not take so gloomy a view ofthe mixing of British and French divisions as Lord Milner andGeneral Wilson,.    He asked them to take these considerationsinto account before the question was finally settled.hitehall Gardens,  S.W.,May 16, 1918.
