SJiili&apos;(This Document is the Property ofHis Britannic Majesty&quot;s Government)WAR CABINET.NOTES OF A CONVERSATION held at 10 downing street, S.W., on WEDNESDAY, JUNE 18, 1218,at 11 a.m.P r e s e n t:-THE PRIME MINISTER (in the Ohair):The Rt. Hon. the viscount Milner,SoOoBo9 G-.C.M.G., Secretary ofState for War:General Sir Ho HoWilson, K.C*B*, D.S.O.,Ohief of the Imperial General Staff:Lto-Col. Sir M.P.A.Hankey, K.CB. *Secretary, War Cabinet:Ltc&quot;-Col. L.S.Amery, M.P.,STATE OF BRITISH DIVISIONS.GENERAL WILSON mentioned that Sir Douglas Haig was rs-oonstituting the whole of the 5 divisions which had beenthrough the Champagne fighting, 3 immediately and the other2 as soon as he oould fill them with the battalions whiohwere coming from Egypt and Salonioa.   He was also reoonstitut-ing S second-class divisions with B. men, who had been sent out before the 60,000. (See Z-lO).   With S cadre divisionstraining 5 American divisions, that left only 2 oadres insteadof 3 to send back to England for training B* men.   If theseshaped well General Wilson proposed to make up the 3rd divisionlo
of B. men with, cadres in England; otherwise, he would send the balance of B. men as drafts^ :Jjo France; in this way weshould shortly have in Franoe wf first-class divisions (in-oluding 10 Colonial divisions); &amp; B. divisions formed inFrance; 2 or 3 B. divisions formed in England; and Z cadrestraining American troops, or a total in all of 61 or 6S divi-sions.   In other words, our divisional position, allowing fordivisions brought to France from Egypt and Italy, would &quot;be substantially as before.AMERICAN COOPERATION.With regard to the allotment of American troops arriving in France during the present month (See X-lO) , GENERAL WILSONreported that as he had some doubt whether the Americans real-ly meant to allot them to the British zone for training, hehad made /inquiries and had just received a telegram from Sea*^^Iwagstaff with General Pershing to the effect that it wasnot contemplated that any American divisions arriving thismonth were to come to the British zone in replacement of the5 which had begun their training with British cadres, but were now being transferred to the French and trained in Frenchcadres.LORD MILKER admitted that, at the present moment, we werenot9 as a matter of faot, in a position to handle more Ameri-oan troops, and that the French had probably a much largersupply of surplus cadres or officers who could help the train-ing of American troops.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that if we had any heavy fighting in the near future, as was probable, we should cer-tainly have some more cadres available for training Americans.In any case this seemed to him a going back on our whole agree-ment with the Americans and he considered that it was essen-tial that a protest should be madee
GENERAL WILSON said he had discussed the matter with Gen-eral Bu Cane, who was going over that day fully seized of thepoint and would raise it at once with General Eooh.AMERICAN GUNNERS *With referenoe to the suggestion that General Pershing shouldlend us the services of American gunners for training, and tomake good our deficiencies, GENERAL WILSON reported that hehad not yet heard anything further.    (xr_\.CONCLUSION.GENERAL WILSON undertook to telegraph to GeneralLawrence to find out what action he had taken withgeneral Pershing in the matter and with what result.MAN-POWER.iGENERAL WILSON stated that he understood Colonel Roure&apos;sreport was going to he unfavourable to the War office.   Hisopinion apparently was that the Army Council were squanderingtheir man-power in auxiliary services.   He gathered that Col-one 1 Roure had no intention of showing his report to use the PRIME MINISTER said that it was essential that he should see Colonel Roure, and have his report, or, at any rate, hieviews in writing, and that if he refused to do so, he would atonce telegraph to Monsieur Clemenoeau protesting against a breach of the agreement under which Colonel Roure was sent over*CONCLUSION..THE PRIME MINISTER undertook to see Colonel Rourethat afternoon.REARWARD SERVICES.With referenoe to the above, THE PRIME MINISTER consideredthat Colonel Roure was probably right with regard to the waste&apos;0f our man-power.   Various reports showed that the presentLabour organisation was very defective.   Sir Robert Borden had also pointed out to him that the Canadian Corps had both inputting out wire and in trench work done ten times as much as
^itehall Gardens, S.W.,June 12, 1918*any corresponding unit of the British Army, and had formed a very low opinion of the engineering arrangements of the Armygenerally.It was pointed out that the Canadians had enjoyed advantagees in the shape of being always kept together as a Corps andmostly in the same place, although it was held that eventhese advantages oould not account for more than a part of thedifference.LORD MILKER said that this really opened up the whole largequestion of the Rearward Services, which he had been attempt-ing to get settled in spite of very considerable opposition from Sir Eric Geddes, General Nash, and Sir Douglas Haig.What was required was both a better distribution of ourlabour and a better system of inspection.   Our railway ser-vioe had been organised on the basis of an advance to the rhine, and was much too extravagant for present conditions.He considered that what was really needed was a single bigadministrative branch to cover both the Q.M.Gfs Department,the R.E., work, and the railways.THE PRIME MINISTER admitted the need of a re-organisation,and considered that it was also most essential to secure a really first-class man as Head of the whole engineering work.What was required was a Todlebea.GENERAL WILSON mentioned that he had suggested General Har-per as suitable for that post.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that possibly the Chief Engin-eer of the Canadian Corps, who had done such remarkable work with his Corps, might also be considered.   A big civil engin-eer with some military experience was probably the best manfor the task.
