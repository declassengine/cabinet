PIE1D MARSHAL HAIG- made the following replyIn the event of the enemy asking for an armistice thenature of the reply should depend greatly on the answerswhich we can make to the two following questions:-1.      Is Germany so beaten that she will accept any terms dictated by the Allies ?2.      Can the Allies continue to press the enemy sufficientlyvigorously during the coming winter months to causehim to withdraw so quickly that he cannot destroy the railways, roads, etc., up to the german frontier ?A very large part of the German Army has been badlybeaten, but the whole. Pield Army has not yet been broken up.Owing to the large number of Divisions of which it consistsgeneral disorganisation (which follows a decisive defeat) isnot yet apparent.In my opinion the German Army is capable of retiringto its own frontiers and holding that line against equal oreven superior forces.The length of that line is about 245 miles as againstthe front of 400 miles which he was holding only a week ago.The situation of the Allied Armies is as follows :-The Erench Army seems greatly, worn out.      Many of the rank and file seem to feel that the war has been won.    Lille,Roubaix, Tourcoing and other big centres of industry havebeen taken.    Reports say that many of their men aredisinclined to risk their lives.      Certainly neither on theright nor on the left of the British have the Arench attackedvigorously during the past six weeks.     Even in July it wasthe British and American Divisions which carried the prench forward on the Marne.     Next year a large proportionTHE PRIME MINISTER asked Pield Marshal Haig to outlinehis suggestions as to the terms of an armistice.
of the French Armies will probably be Black iAmerican Army is disorganised,  ill-equipped and ill-trained with very few ii,C,0&apos;s and officers of experience. Ithas suffered severely through ignorance of modern war and itmust take at least a year before it becomes a serious fightingforce.The British Army has fought hard.      It is a veteranforce, very confident in itself but its infantry is already50,000 under strength.      If infantry effectives could bemaintained and rest given during winter it would remain what it is now, the most formidable fighting force in the world.On the other hand with diminishing effectives we must expectmoral to decline.If the French and American Armies were capable of a ser-ious offensive now, the Allies could completely overthrowthe remaining efficient enemy divisions before they could reach the line of the Meuse.They are not.      We must reckon with that fact as wellas with the fact that the British Army alone is not sufficient-ly fresh   or strong to force a decision by itself. *This means that the Allies are not in a position toprevent the enemy from doing an immense amount of material damage to railways,  roads, etc.,  during the winter months and during his retirement.The advance of the Allies, when active operations againbegin, will, therefore,  be greatly hampered and progress mustbe slow.In the coming winter, too, the enemy will have several months for recuperation, and absorption of the 1920 class,untouched as yet.So we must conclude that the enemy will be able to hold the
the line which he selects for defence for some time afterthe campaign of 1919 commences.To sum up then a careful consideration of the Military situation onthe Western Front,  and keeping British interests in view,forces-me to the conclusion that an armistice with germany should he concluded on the following &quot;basis :-1.    Complete and immediate evacuation of Belgium and occupied French territories.2.    Alsace and Lorraine must also be evacuated andMeta and Strasburg handed forthwith to the Allies.3,    Rolling-stock of French and Belgian railwaysor equivalent to &quot;be returned,  inhabitantsrepatriated etc.The effect of this would be that the Allied Armieswould be established on the enemy&apos;s frontier with their communications intact and adequate rolling-stock.From such a position a resumption of hostilities wouldenable the war to be prosecuted under favourable conditions on the enemy1s soil.     Moreover, with Metz, Strasburg,and Alsace-Lorraine in our possession the Allies would bein a position to invade South Germany.     The militaryand political advantages of an advance in this directionwould be very considerable.^-^&quot;&quot;&quot;MR. BONAR LAW observed that this amounted toa complete defeat to the enemy.     No nation would everaccept such terms unless they were in desperate straits.So far as he could see there was nothing in themilitary situation to compel him to accept such terms.FIELD MARSHAL HAIG
mm R-MFIELD MARSHAL HAIG- pointed out that the enemy might think that the Allies were stronger than they were in realiiy,MR.BONAB LAW said that the question was largely apsychological one, namely, whether after the lapse of somemonths, the moral of the enemy or of the Allied nations would he the stronger.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the real point was whether the German moral would he strong enough to enablethem to resume the offensive, in the event of a breakdown of Peace negotiations, to recover the territories they hadevacuated under the terras of the armistice.MR.BOHAE LAW pointed out that It would be necessary.in addition, to obtain security for the Navy.      If we didnot obtain possession of the German Fleet and the submarinesunder the terms of the armistice we might have to continuethe War for that purpose.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that the enemy wouldbe no better off at the end of an armistice in a naval sensethan he was now.      After a break of, say, two months, during-which none of the- Allied ships had been sunk,  and hundreds of thousands of tons had been built, the Allies, and notthe enemy would be the better off.      The enemy would only have improved his position by 6 or 7 submarines.MR.BOFAR LAW said that the question was whether wecould allow peace to come without entirely altering thepresent balance of naval strength.      Otherwise, all theold controversies would arise as to the number of ships ofvarious classes possessed by Great Britain and Germany res-respectively.       While admitting that Field Marshal Haig wasonly concerned in the military aspects of the question,MR.BONAR LAW said they could not be separated from the navalquestion, since it might be necessary to continue the War on land in order to secure the naval conditions we desired.
-5-117LORD MILNER thought it probable that the enemy would never be able to pull himself together for a new military effort after we had once secured possession of the terri-torles field Marshal Haig had proposed as the conditions ofan armistice,MR.BONAR LAW said that, nevertheless,  we must oom-pletely reverse the naval situation,  and in view of thedifficulty of starting the War after an armistice, we should secure this as part of the terms.SIR MAURICE HAMTCIY said that,  in a conversation hehad had the previous day with Mr.Badfour and Lord robert cecil, it had been pointed out that we should have to holdgauges as security for the payment by Germany of what was required for the reparation and restoration of Belgium andWorth Prance,     Unless such gauges were held the enemymight refuse to carry out the bargain, and If the principle was accepted that there could be no reopening of hostilitiesafter an armistice,  we must have these gauges in hand aspart of the terms of an armistice.LORD MILNER suggested that we might occupy german territory on the left bank of the Rhine above Coblenz, as a pledge for all that we required,MR.BOMR LAW considered that this would meet allobjections.GENERAL WILSON pointed out that under field MarshalHaig&apos;s terms we should hold no gauge.     He was convincedthat once the &quot;Cease firs&quot; sounded, the War would neverstart again.      Hence, it was important to have in hand somegauge which could be given back to Germany after all theterms of the Peace Treaty had been fulfilled,MR.BONAR LAW pointed out the enemy would never give up that unless they were beaten.
THE PRIMS MINISTER did not think on the evidence furnished&apos;by Field Marshal Haig that they were sufficiently defeated toconeede such terms,MR. BONAR LAW pointed out that it depended upon the estimating-ate the enemy raa.de of the Allies strength.    If they were nowin a panic,   as seemed not improbable,   this might be the psychological moment to secure very favourable terms,THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out the danger of losing a goodbargain through asking too much.   We knew exactly what were quired,   and if we obtained that we. should be safe,GENERAL WILSON said he wished to get as a gauge the wholeof the Saar Valley up to the Rhine,LORD MILNER asked Pi eld Marshal Haig how far he hoped to advance before being stopped by bad weather?FIELD MARSHAL HAIG said,we ought not /stop operations.At the present time our troops had secured very good billets,not only in the district round Lille,  but. in the villages inthe region of Le Cateau.    If there was no armistice we oughto 0 o ntinue pressing the enemy .In reply to the prime Minister he said that the Alliesought to be able to press the enemy back as far -as the lineof the Meuse,   although the unforeseen so often happened Inwar that it was dangerous to prophesy.In reply to Mr. Bonar. Law he sold that he had begged Mar-shal Poch to send him American troops to reinforce his own,but General Pershing had declared that he was short of ef-fectives.    The two divisions of Americans which had been left with him were now weak and had had to be withdrawn,THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out  the absurdity of  their beinany shortage of men in the American Army,    250,000 men werebeing brought over every month,   and British ships shone were carrying
carrying from 150,000 to 190,000 men a month,    In these con-ditions,   it was preposterous that only 2 divisions were givento the British Army.    The only way to press the Americans wasto threaten to withhold our shipping.    He thought that whenColonel House arrived in this country he ought to he toldstraight that the Americans were making a mess of it.    Atpresent the American press were sending out the most absurd,accounts of the prowess of their Army,  and president Wilsonwas probably being misled.    In.his last Note,  president wilson had spoken of the supremacy of the troops of the UnitedStates of America and their Allies,  or some such phrase.    Itwas very important that Marshal Poch should talk very straightto 0o 1 onel House ,FIELD MARSHAL HAIG said he had done his utmost to get Gea-eral Pershing to leave the 5 divisions which had been attach-ed to the British Army,      General Pershing1s only reply had been to take 3 of the divisions away,    This had occurred whileBritish troops were actually marching up to the battle zone,and the American troops had impeded their communications.FIELD MARSHAL HAIG said it was important to know what theFrench troop? were thinking.    Now that Lille and a. great-part of North Prance had been recovered this was of spec-ial importance.      The French troops had. not fought particu-larly well in Flanders,( GENERAL WILSON then read a. Note he had received fromGeneral Du Cane in regard to Marshal Foch&apos;s ideas onthe subject of an Armistice.  (Appendix)).LORD MILNER said his own proposal for occupj^ing territoryup to Ane west bank of the Rhine above Gobi ens was very sim-llar to Marshal FochAs,   only did not include the bridgeheads.THE PRIME MINISTER said it was quite certain the enemy would not consent to the occupation of this territory,LORD MILNER suggested tnat they might do  so if american troops were put in instead of French,   or,   possibly,   evenBritish troops,THE PRIME MINISTER
- 9  -120THE PRIME MINISTER thought that the threat of  a continua-tiori of the &quot;blockade would be much more effective&apos; as a gauge.GENERAL WILSON expressed doubt  as to whether the Erenchand Americans would agree to s continuation of the blockadeaf t er hostilities had ceas e d.THE PRIME MINISTER then referred to  Italy,    No doubt  theItalians would want the evacuation of the Trentino and I stria,as their terms for an armistice.    The Austrians might be insuch a deplorable situation as to give up anything, but theItalian Army had certainly done nothing to justify such acl aim,(At this point there was some reference to aproposition by General Seely for utilisinggas on a large scale in the event of a break -down of an armistice).THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out, that with the gas referredto by General Seely a very big coup might be achieved beforemany months were over,GENERAL. WILSON thought that something might be achievedWith it,  but it would be unwise to count too much on it,(THE FIRST SEA LORD entered at this point).THE PRIME MINISTER asked the First Sea Lord&apos;s views on thquest.1 on of an armies st ice.ADMIRAL WEMYSS said that he had consulted the Commander-in-Chief of the Grand Fleet as to what conditions he would want for an armistice,   and in making this request he hadavoided biassing him by suggesting any terras.    Admiral Beat-ty had replied that we ought to demand the surrender of twoout  of three squadrons of the German battleships, which,  in hiview,   should be brought to our ports. These squadronscontained the newest of the German battleships.    In addition,he demanded the surrender of all battle cruisers,   a certainnumber of light cruisers,   and 50 Destroyers,   in addition toall
all the German submarines.    The Board of the Admiralty,Admiral Wemyss continued, held the view that the submarines were on a different plane to surface craft.    Owing to moral and practical reasons - they considered that all the German submarinesshould be surrendered,  and not merely the 60 suggested at versailles.    The figure of 60 had been based on the consiciera-tion that the maximum number of German submarines that hadever been out at one time was calculated.at 35.    30 was a figure rarely reached.    This figure had been doubled,  and ithad been thought that in practice this was the maximum numberthat could be obtained,   as at any moment a large proportionwere always laid up and immobile.    The Board of the Admiraltyalso considered that the blockade should continue,  that allsurface craft should be withdrawn into harbours,   and basesde signat ed by the Allies.&quot;THE PRIME; MINISTER pointed out that this amounted toabject surrender.ADMIRAL WEMYSS agreed.    He  said that  some Members of theBoard held that the question of occupying Kiel and the KielCanal should be considered.    Personally   , he old not agree,as he regarded  this as a military rather than a naval question,since the Army would have to occupy these points.LORD MILKER suggested that it was a peace rather than sinarmistice condition.THE PRIME MINISTER asked. Field Marshal Haig what would, bethe effect on.our Army if we insisted on very stern terms suchas had been suggested, and. the enemy refused ?FIELD MARSHAL HAIG reminded, the Prime Minister that a yearago the Army had been asking what they were fighting for, --(THE PRIME MINISTER interpolated that this was one of thereasons why he had made his &quot;far Aims  speech)        If the Armycould be kept up to strength,  he had no doubt that their moral
- 1]122would &quot;be perfectly all right.    We knew, however,   that theArmy could not be kept up to strength,   and with reducednumbers, he thought the effect on the moral of the Army,   ofa very stiff demand on the part of the Allies resulting ina prolongation of the war,  would he bad.TEE PRIME MINISTER said that the Navy must keep these considerations in viev.-.    The whole question really was whether, at the end of an armistice,  we  should be in a. bettermilitary position than before,LORD MILNER said we should he in an awkward fix if theenemy replied, affirmatively to the naval conditions outlined by the First Sea Lord,  but made this conditional on cessation of the blockade.    He suggested it would be better to allow the enemy to retain his submarines in-order to retain theblockade,MR, BONAR LAW thought it very doubtful whether America andFrance would agree to a continuation of the blockade if theenemy had been compelled to surrender his submarines.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that the cessation of theblockade would place the enemy in a better position than before the armistice,  and this,  therefore,  contravened thegeneral principle on which we were considering the question,On the face of it, however,   such terms as had. been outlined by the First Sea. Lord could only be accepted by a nation thatwas beaten to the dust.GENERAL WILSON asked the Prime Minister to put himself inthe position of the German governing classes.    They had not got command of the, sea,   as they had hoped to do,  and they had lost their communication with the East.    They would see thatsooner or- later they were bound to lose and might acceptalmost any terms.THE PRIME MINISTER said that pride would overrule reasonif the terms were too stiffs
LORD MIIiHSE said that the enemy might accept part of theterms offered them, and not the remainder.THE PRIME MINISTER thought that the enemy might accept theterms propounded by Pield Marshal Haig.ADMIRAL WEMYSS said that the military analogy was very valuable to the Admiralty in considering the naval conditionsof an armistice, and he asked if he could be informed of thePield Marshal1^ conditions.(At this point MR.BAIPOUR entered).SIR MAURICE hankey ,  at the request of the Prime Minister,read the terms propounded by the Pield Marshal.PIELD MARSHAL HAIG said that the principle he acted on wasthat the enemy should not be in a better position at the endof an armistice than he was in now.     Under present conditionshe was able to destroy the railways and all means of communica-tion in his retirement.     Under an armistice he would evacuatethese railways, leave them intact, and hand back the large amountof rolling stock which he had taken from the Prench and. Belgians.(At this point several of the questions that hadbeen discussed previously were again raised for thebenefit of Mr.Balfour.)ADMIRAL WEMYSS said that the submarine question was a corn-plicated one.      If the War came to an end now we should nothave perfected our anti-submarine methods of warfare.     great improvement had been made, but our measures were not yet com-plete.     He foresaw that it would be difficult to make thesame progress in time of peace as in time of war.     Of course,there was no question of prolonging the War to enable us todo this, but, nevertheless,  if we had not done so the submarineswould remain a menace to the whole world.     This was really the argument for insisting on a surrender of the enemy submarines.It was on the Prime Minister1 s principle that fighting could never be renewed after an armistice that he proposed the surrender of all the submarines as a condition of an armistice.
THE Prime MINISTER said  tax the great principle in regardto the armistice was to get In hand everything that you required.We already had the German Colonies.     By the Field Marshallterms we should get possession of everything else that were quired on the Western front.      In the event of peace negotia-tions breaking down,  the enemy would then have t^o take theinitiative to recover what he had given up, and not the Allies.MB.BALFOUK pointed out that the Allies would not havePoland in their hands.      President Wilson had committed himself to the establishment of an Independent Poland, and we had, tosome extent, committed ourselves also.LORD MILEEE asked if we could go on fighting for that?There was general agreement that we could not, butME.BALPOUE pointed out that we should be in great difficulties.LORD MIIiHEE siiggested that the blockade would be astxfficient gauge to ensure the establishment of a free Poland.The economic pressure of the blockade was tremendous,2,Whitehall Gardens, S.W.19th October,1918.
On my return to-day I  spoke to General WEYGAND on thesubject of the conditions of armistice advocated &quot;by MarshalPOCH.      The next  step rests with the enemy,   and it ispossible that he may shortly address a request for an armisticeto the General-in-Chief of the Allied Forces in France.    There-fore I  thought,   it  desirable to  ascertain whether Marshal FOCHwished to discuss the matter formally with the C.-in-C.,   sothat in the event  of the occasion prising action might be taken without delay that had been agreed upon beforehand.,General TOYGAND told me that so far Marshal FOCH had not discussed with him the question of obtaining the views of theAllied Commanders-in-Chief on this subject, but that he would speak to him about it at once.General WEYGAND said that Marshal FOCH&apos;s views on thequestion of armistice were based on two principles;1, The conditions must be such that if the armistice isbroken off we must be able to continue the war undermore fa.voura.ble circumstances than at present.2.    If the armistice leads to peace negotiations,   theconditions of the armistice must be such as to  ensurethat the conditions of peace will be loyally carriedout,   that is to say.,   the armistice must place in our hands pledges of value.Marshal POCH thinks that  these conditions would &quot;be satisfactorily fulfilled,   so far as the Western Front is con-concerned,   if the enemy were to withdraw at  once from all occupied territory,   including ALSACE-LORRAINE,   and if Allied troops wereto occupy enemy territory up to the RHINE,  with bridgeheadsbeyond.General WEYGAND also said that Marshal FOCH was firm onthe point that the conditions of armistice could not be settled by the Allied. Governments without reference to him as General-in-Chief t   and that the conditions must be communicated to theenemy through him.    He considers this necessary in order to
ensure the interests of the Allied Armies under his command in the event of hostilities &quot;being renewed.I  also  understood from General WEYGAND that Marshal FOCHconsiders that the conditions of armistice in other theatresand at  sea, form separate questions,   and that it is not necessary for the whole to &quot;be combined before being communi-c a ted t o  the e n erny .( Sd.)
