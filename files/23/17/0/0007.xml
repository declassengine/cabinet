In view of the devel-opment of the -attach towards Paris, s-nd the withdrawal ofFrench reserves in this direction, General Foch had asxedSir Douglas Haig to send. 3 divisions from his Reserve, witha view to establishingwastride the Somme west of Amiens,whence they might be used as a reserve for either the Frenchor British Armies.    Sir Douglas Haig had replied that hewas taking steps at once to comply with General Facias re-quest,  but wished to enter a formal protest       in view ofthe situation on his own front and the withdrawal from theBritish area of %im- French reserves , and of l( American(This Document is the property of HisBritannic Majesty1s Government.)
divisions  -- against the removal of any portion of the British Army from his Command until it was definitely established that most of the reserves available for the Crown Prince from Prince Rupprecht&apos;s command had been absorbed into the battle. Sir Douglas Haig further pointed out to General Foch that the enemy&apos;s preparations for an attack on the British Front were well advanced,  that he could not afford to cede ground between the Somme and the Lys, and that North of the Lys in the Ypres salient he would have to fight under unfavourable conditions. Under the circumstances,  the removal beyond his reach of any part of his already inadequate reserves might be disastrous. The telegram concluded with the request that the 9th Corps and the remainder of the 19th division might be withdrawn West of Amiens for reconstitution. GENERAL WILSON drew attention to the fact that Field Marshal Haig had made a protest against the orders given him. He himself considered that, under the circumstances, there was only one course open, and that was for the Northern part of the British forces to fall back on the flooded line of ?. St. Omer and so shortening the front to be held. He was absolutely convinced that we were not in a position to hold the present line against the attack that Prince Rupprecht, who still had 48 divisions in reserve, could deliver against us. General Foch still insisted on his formula that no foot of ground should be given. But on this point Generals Petain, Antoine, Field Marshal Haig, as well as General Wilson himself, were against him. The formula had already led to the mishap on the Chemin des Dames, and a consequent extension of our line by over 30 miles. If the formula were persisted in General Foch would lose the War. In his General Wilson&apos;s opinion, the British Army had not a fighting chance against Prince Rupprecht under such conditions. General Foch&apos;s


request really raised the issue which he understood had&quot;been settled by the unanimous agreement of May 2, that ifit came to a choice between defending the Channel ports and maintaining&apos; the French line, we should decide upon the lat-ter. He once again laid the utmost stress on the necessityof taking this step immediately, and apprehended that, even now, it might be too late.LORD MILNERi considered that General Foch was right in bringing these divisions astride the Somme.    But it was a necessary consequence of this step that we should begin tocome back on the North.    In view of the strength of princeRupprecht&apos;s reserves,and the possibility of his attackingboth at Montdidier and in the North, it was impossible for as to hold so long a line.    By shortening the line we would;create new reserves which would replace the ones taken fromGeneral Byng&apos;s Army.    The swing-back had to begin, and sofar did not involve giving up the Channel ports, though itimperilled Dunkirk, and raised the question of what the Bel-belgian Army was to do.    GENERAL WILSON said he had discussed the latter point with General Antifcoine, who said he couldfix it up with the Queen of the Belgians in half-an-hour.THE PRIME MINISTER drew attention to the fact that theAmerican troops, in spite of their lack of Draining, had ap-apparently met the new German style of fighting very welloThis style was practically the old Boer method of Individ-ual stalking with the substitution of the machine-gun forthe rifle, and,in dealing with it,troops who were used to open country and not trench stale, had an advantage.    He-was sure the Americans could be put into line more quicklythan had been contemplated, and there were lQ divisions ofthem already available,  or available shortly. ,GENERAL WILSON pointed out that 5 of these were already&apos;st&amp;c fin-line, but agreed it was worth while pushing the Americansforward as quickly as possible,

He wished to have,first of all, an- immediate formal decision from the WarCabinet,  to be followed by an Allied Council of War.
