and if French, and Italian troops were utilised mainly forthe occupation of Austrian territory, it would leave behind the impression that the French and Italians had been mainly responsible for the allied victory.    As a matter of fact,the British Empire had been mainly responsible for our vio-tory, and the tendency was for us to leave it to M. Clemen-Clemenceau and Marshal foch  and Colonel House to get the credit and to settle the fate of the world.LORD MILNER said that he was apprehensive that we mightget into serious difficulties by the occupation of Austrianterritory.    Already immense demands were being made for Brit-ish troops in all parts of the world   Archangel, Murmansk,Siberia, the Caucasus, Turkey, &amp;c.    Moreover, very largenumbers of men were being brought home in connection with de-mobilisation, coal, and for other purposes.    All these de-mands fell on the fighting men.   Although the British Armyabroad numbered some 1,700,000 men, only a proportion ofthese were fighting troops, and he did not want to see themscattered too widely.THE PRIME MINISTER said that there were advantages in notdemobilising too quickly, as it would be difficult to absorball the men at once.    This strengthened his argument in fa-vour of taking part in the occupation of such places asVienna and Budapest.    He did not ask that the War cabinet should reverse their decision, but   he thought that theyshould reserve their final judgment until they had heardM. Clemenceau1s arguments in favour of occupying these places.LORD MILKER agreed that it would be desirable to have a conversation with M. Clemenceau on the subject.THE ARMY AND THE GENERAL ELECTION.THE PRIME MINISTER impressed on the Secretary of Statefor War the great importance of making the best possible\EE - -/ml

He hoped not lessthan 1 million men would do so.    The only difficulty would bein the case of men absent from their units or moving on de-attached service.
