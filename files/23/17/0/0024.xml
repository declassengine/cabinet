WAH CABINET.NOTES OP A CONVERSATION at 10 Downing Street, S.W. ,on FRIDAY,  july 19, 1918, at 11 a.m.Present:The Prime Minister (in the Chair):The Rt. Hon. the Viscount Milner, G.CB.,G.C.M.G. , Secretary of State for War:General Sir H.H.Wilson, K.CB. , D.S.O.,Chief of the Imperial General staff:Lt.-Col. Sir M.P.A.Hankey, K.CB.,Secretary, War Cabinet.Ito-Col. I.S.Amery, M.P.,THE WESTERN FRONT.GENERAL WILSON said there were still only 28 divisions identified,and he was more strongly of the opinion that this was not the real german offensive.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that the French were now so close tothe railway at soissons that the Germans were deprived of the use of this line, and might have great difficulty in maintaining themselves in the salient South of the Aisne, unless they made an effort to drive back theFrench and free Soissons.GENERAL WILSON thought that, from the German point of view, the Frenchcounter-attack might be by no means unwelcome.    Some 22 prench divisions were already engaged in it as against something like 10 German divisions,and it might be worth while abandoning all the ground they had gainedSouth of the Chemin des Dames in order to embroil and use up the Frenchreserves and leave prince Rupprecht free for a heavy blow against theBritish front.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that if Ludendorff were really strong enough to manage that the German Crown Prince should be defeated in orderto enable the Crown Prince of Bavaria to win a great victory, he wouldbe the biggest General in the world.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,July 19, 1918.
