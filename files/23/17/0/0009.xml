W. ,on THURSDAY,  JUNE 6,  1918,  at 11.15 a.m.Present:THE PRIME MINISTER (in the Chair):TIT   &quot;the Rt. Hon. A. Bonar Law,Chancellor of the Exchequer:(for the latter part only):The Rt. Hon.  the Viscount Milner,G.C.B.,  G.C.M.G.,  Secretary ofState for Ear:General Sir H.H.Wilson, K.C.B., D.S.0.,Chief of the Imperial General Staff:Lt,-Col. Sir M.p.A.Hankey, K..0.B. ,Secretary, War Cabinet:It.-Col. L.S.Amery, M.P.,IrvELAND.THE PRIME MINISTER mentioned that Field Marshal french had already given instructions for certain drafts to leaveIreland for France.FORCES AT SALQNICA.GENERAL WILSON drew attention to a somewhat misleadingtelegram (No.485)  sent by the Foreign Office to Lord Gran-ville, stating that there was &apos;no intention of weakening theAllied forces at Salonica.CONCLUSION.It was decided to bring up the matter at theWar Cabinet.THE MILITARY SITUATION.There was a further discussion on the question of the1.
withdrawal of 3 divisions from ins: Sir Douglas  [aig to thereserve behind Amiens and the sending of 5 American divi-sions to Alsace.GENERA! WILSON pointed out that a withdrawal even as faras the Bergues line would save 5 or 4 divisions, and thoughit would eventually deprive us of theb.se of Dunkirk,-, it wouldnot give the use of it to the Germans.    He mentioned that agreat deal of the stuff had been moved away from Dunkirkalready, and that arrangements had been made so that theplace could be very quickly destroyed as far as its useful-ness to the enemy went.    If General foch  was not preparedto accept a withdrawal on the North now, he thought it wouldbe only reasonable to ask him to agree that if Sir douglas haig sent three divisions across the homme, he should beallowed to use his own discretion in the North as to the best way of fighting his own battle.    phis would leave Sir Doug-las Haig free to draw in his left as soon as he saw signsof a strong German concentration against him.    phis wouldinvolve warning  the Belgians,which could be done by GeneralAntoine or General plumer, both of whom got on much betterwith the Hing and Queen than General foch  did.There was also some farther discussion of the alternative of leaving the American divisions,  or mo st of them, and us-ing them to replace 4 divisions of the D.A.N-, in the North-ern sector, which could then take the place of the Erenchdivisions General foch  wished to bring up from Alsace.    the americans did not like to go down to Alsace, and the wholeproceeding would take much longer.    It was concluded that,in any case,  General foch  would have to make some concession,either agreeing to a withdrawal now,  or to giving Sir douglas haig a free hand to withdraw when necessary, or else leavethe Americans in. the British area in place of the divisions of the D.A.N.,S.
Attention was drawn to the fact that no really definitemilitary declaration had &quot;been secured from General Pochat the Meeting of the Supreme Mar Council in favour of in-tervention.CONCLUSION.LORD MILKER and GENERAL jILSQM undertook to securesuch a declaration from General Poch.2,  Phitehall Gardens, S.W**June 6, 1918o
