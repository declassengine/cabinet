.....&apos;4-r   29I - C   &apos; t . -    .(This Document is the Property of HisBritannic 1,&apos;Iajesty&apos;s Government).Hi 0 R E T.ft. MR CABINET.I    j - .I NOTES OF A CONVERSATION at 10 Downing Street, S.W. ,I on WEDNESDAY, MAY 29, 1918, at 11 a.m.Present: -THE PRIME MINISTER (in the Chair):The Rt. Hon. Viscount Milner,  G.C.B.,G.O.M.G., Secretary of State for War:General Sir H.H.Wilson, K.C.B., D.S.O.,Chief of the Imperial General. Staff:lieutenant-Colonel Sir M. p.A. Hankey, K.C.B.,Secretary, War Cabinet:Lieutenant-Colonel L.S.Amery, M.P. ,THE GERMAN OFFENSIVE.LORD MILNER reported that, when he had seen M. Clemenceauon the morning of the S7th, the latter had not taken a verygloomy view of the offensive and had, in fact, intimated thathe was glad that the Germans had aftacked and had not compell-ed the French to do so.    In Lord Milner&apos;s opinion the seriousaspect of the situation lay in the possibly shaky state ofFrench moral.    The recent strikes had been decidedly ugly.They were definitely anti-war strikes, with the object offorcing from the Government a declaration as to its War Aims.GENERAL WILSON concurred in the anxiety expressed by lord milner with regard to the strike situation, and thoughtthat it was possibly for this very reason that the germans had decided to throw their weight upon the French.    From a purely military point of view, if this was indeed the german.
main effort, and the French troops fought well,  the general position was one with which we could &quot;be satisfied.    The oom-munications on the German side would be bad, unless and until they could get the Soissbns.-Ehe.ims railway in working order.In any case, he would much sooner see the Germans in ChateauThierry than in Doullens.As regards the immediate situation, GENERAL WILSON expectedthat the Germans would get Soissons that day, and possiblyRheims as well.    They were at Venizel, lg- kilometres outsideSoissons.    So far 16 German divisions had been identified, butGeneral Ivlacdonogh and Intelligence G.H.Q.., considered that therewere probably another 20 behind.GENERAL WILSON mentioned that he had telegraphed three questions:-(1)  To ascertain the temperature at General FochTsHeadquarters?(S)  How the French troops were fighting? and(3)  How General Foch envisaged the future?COMMUNICATION WITH GENERAL FOCH.In connection with the above, THE PRIME MINISTER drew at-tention to the absence of direct communication with General Foch1Headquarters.GENERAL WILSON explained that he had tried to arrange this,but had been put off Owing to the idea that General foch  wasabout to change his Headquarters,  and for various other reasons.CONCLUSION.GENERAL WILSON undertook to make a further effort to secure direct communication with General FochAsHeadquarters.CAMOUFLAGE.THE PRIME MINISTER drew attention to the extraordinary suc-cess with which the Germans had concealed their offensive upto the last moment, and suggested there might, after all,be something in the suggestion put forward by Mr. Solomon that theyhad some specially successful means of camouflage,  even if the
particular device suggested by Mr. Solomon was too fanciful.GENERAL WILSON did not think that there was anything more in the surprise than the abu^ance of cover provided by thewooded country on this front, and the excellence of the Ger-man railway system.    Our own attacks at Arras, Messines, andOambrai had been complete surprises.GAS SHELLING.In connection with the very heavy gas shelling now used bythe Germans,  more particularly with mustard gas, which linger-ed for some time,  THE PRIME MINISTER raised the question how the Germans themselves crossed the infected zone?    It was sug-gested that possibly the Germans might use some ointmentwhich &quot;protected the more vulnerable parts of their person fromthe effect of the mustard gas, or else that they definitelyselected certain sectors of the front for gassing and certainothers for passing through, thus going round the infected patch,done as they had kEKE in the case of Armentieres.CONCLUSION.GENERAL WILSON undertook to look further intothe matter.THE AMERICAN TROOPS.LORD MI LITER reported that he had inspected one of the Amer-ican divisions now attached for training purposes to GeneralRawlinsonrs Army.    They were fine men, very keen, but also veryraw.    He had not  been much impressed by the Senior Officers,but the younger ones seemed very intelligent.    Relations withthe British troops were excellent.    The training ground waswell chosen.    He thought that they wanted at least a month or six weeks&apos; more training,  though they might be available at apinch even earlier.    He understood that one of the divisions which he had not seen was rather more advanced than the others.With regard to the manner in which they were to be employedin action, he had understood from Sir Douglas Haig that theywere to be trained by the cadre divisions, but that when
trained they were to he attached, first by battalions, and af-terwards by regiments  (brigades)  to our fighting divisions.GENERAL WILSON was not quite sure whether this plan had notbeen changed.    He had received a telephone message from whichhe understood that at General Poch&apos;s instance it was now ar-ranged that the cadre divisions should go into the line withtheir American infantry, as soon as the&quot; training of the lat-ter was complete.    He was, however, &apos;expecting a letter fromSir Douglas Haig on the subject.As regards the actual numbers, LORD MILNER stated that therewere now 90,000 American troops behind our line mainly con-sisting of infantry and machine-gunners, and that we were short-ly to have a total of 10 divisions --  (12,000 infantry and3,000 machine-gunners per division)  -- which was about as muchas we could handle.GENERAL WILSON reported that he had had a telegram fromGeneral headquarters with reference to the questions ashed onthe previous day (War Cabinet 418).    There were now attachedto the British force in France the equivalent of 57-g-battalions and 65 machine-gun companies, or about 70,000 fighting sold-iers in all.    Of these none were fit for the line at present,and 12 battalions would be fit for the line in six weeks1  time.THE PRIME MINISTER expressed astonishment that, in view ofthe past training of these troops and the fact that 20,000of them had already been a month in Prance, it would be so long before they were available to put into the line.LORD MILNER also considered that a rather pessimistic view.Undoubtedly it would be desirable to give the troops that amount of training, but they could be ready sooner if it was absolutely essential to put them in.THE PRIME MINISTER said that what he wished to have was a clear statement bringing out the position both at the presenttime and, say, on the 1st August*,-3baa? aagsgBasd sturaaB-4c
(a) As to the number of American troops brought over toFranc e:  and(b) As to the numbers actually passed into the fighting line.Further, he would wish very much to know what president 7/1Isonreally had in his mind with regard to the conduct of the war for next year.GENERAL WILSON explained that the War Office were working out a statement which would cover most of the questions withregard to the American position.THE MILITARY POSITION DURING THE NEXTFEW MONTHS.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was anxious to have a con-spec tus of the situation during the next four months from thepoint of view of actual numbers.    He wished to know what ourestimated losses might be during the period, what we couldfill up with from British and American sources, and how weshould stand at the end of each successive month.GENERAL WILSON pointed out that a statement which would cov-er these points was being prepared.    General Harrington was,however, waiting for the letter from Sir Douglas Haig,. in orderto ascertain exactly what was going to be done with the Ameri-can divisions.STATISTICAL INFORMATION IN THE WAR OFEIOB.THE PRIME MINISTER drew attention to the difficulty of get-ting satisfactory information of a statistical character fromthe War Office.    Nobody seemed responsible for supplying it,and the figures produced were continua-lly varying, as, for in-stance, in the case of the figures produced to the Man-power committee.    In the Ministry of Munitions he had had at his hand Mr. Layton, who was an Officer specially responsible forfurnishing him with full statistical information at a momentrsnotice on any aspect of the work of the Ministry, and he sug-gested that something of the same sort could be arranged in theWar Office.
C5S0H0-SLOVAKS.LORD MILKER .reported that 1.1.  Clernenceau had been quite will-ing to agree to our having the oomplete control over the czecho-Slovak troops at Archangel and Murmansk and generally to our settling the policy with regard to the extent to whichthey should be used there or sent to Europe.    With regard tothose at Vladivostock, however, he was determined to have thembrought over to France.    He did not consider that they would want to fight in Russia,  or would care to fight alongside withthe Japanese.THE PRIME MINISTER explained that it was decided at a Meet-ing with M. Pichon on the previous day to carry 4,500 a month to Vancouver, of whom the first 4,500 would be in Prance by september.    The matter, however, would be definitely settled at Versailles.    It had been assumed throughout the discussion that the Ozecho-Slovaks could only be brought over at the ex-pense of American troopsoLORD MILKER pointed out that, as a matter of fact, the Amer-ican supply would probably be nearly exhausted in two months1time, so that st-here would be plenty of room then for shippingCzecho-Slovaks eastwards from America in the shipping now bring-ing American troops.    In any case, he was not sure that thetrained Czecho-Slovaks would not be more useful in Prance thanthe same number of untrained Americans.    He thought it wasnecessary to ask the Japanese to help to get them shipped toVancouver, and did not think that this would be taken by theJapanese to mean that we had abandoned all idea of intervention in Siberia.GERMAN INTENTIONS IK PALESTINE.THE PRIME MINISTER reported a message he had received froma Turkish source,which had proved accurate on previous occa-sions,that 30,000 Germans with 60 batteries were leaving forAsia, presumably, Palestine, and the message advised us not
2, Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.,May 29, 1918cto push, too far, but to hold on to the conquered territory.50 aeroplanes, with s&quot;&amp;s; instructors, but no pilots, were also being sent down.    The message added that the recent visit ofthe Emperor Charles to Constantinople had been entirely run bythe German Ambassador, and that Enver held rather aloof0GENERAL ALISON mentioned that information received by Gen-eral Macdonogh pointed to the possibility of as many as 70,000Germans going southwards.MEETING OE THE SUPREME .VAR COUNCIL.LORD MILNER drew attention to the physical difficulties,inthe present state of the traffic on the roads,of getting theSupreme War Council assembled.    He was in favour of reducing*the number of those going to a minimum, and of investigating the possibility of going by way of Havre and.&apos;thence by specialtrain.THE PRIME MINISTER also drew attention to the undesirabil-ity of drawing away General foch  and other soldiers from theirpressing duties in the middle of the great battle, and suggest-ed the possibility of the Meeting taking place at some pointin the neighbourhood of General Eochls Headquarters, which couldbe accessible by motor from Dieppe.CONCLUSION.It was decided to ascertain General EoclWs conveniencein the matter.
