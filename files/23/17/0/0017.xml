L.S.Amery, M.P.,THE REDUCTION OP GERMAN DIVISIONS.SIR MAURICE HANKEY drew attention to the Versailles summary of June 22,In which it was stated that the Germans had recently disbanded 2 divi-sions on the Western front, bringing their total strength down from 207to 205.    Another division of landsturm was now no longer reckoned as aiivision, so that the German total was now down from 242 to 239 divi-sionsoCZECHOSLOVAKS.THE PRIME MINISTER drew attention to the undesirability of shippingaway Czeoho-Slovaks from Vladivostock at a moment when the rest of their force was forming the nucleus of a possible counter-revolution in Siberia,tod when those at vladivostock might do good work in preventing stores)eing shipped away by the Bolshevists, as had happened at Archangel. Hesuggested that though it might be necessary to ship 4,000 or 5,000 awayto satisfy M. Clemenceau, it would be better to procrastinate about theAMERICAN COOPERATION.LORD MILNER suggested that it was very desirable to be able to bring forward at Versailles a simple formula on which the future raising anddespatch of the American Army could be based.   He had made inquiries astcD shipping, and ascertained that 250,000 a month could be brought over.She formula he would suggest was that 300,000 men a month should beraised, 250,000 men a month brought over, and that these should include$ divisions a month for General Pershing.So Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,June 26, 1918.
