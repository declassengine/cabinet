EGRET.(This Document is the Property of HisBritannic Majesty1s Government).WAR CABINET.NOTES OE A CONVERSATION held at 10 downing street,S.W., on MONDAY, JUNE 24, 1918, at 11.15 a.m.P r e s e n t:-THE PRIME MINISTER (in the Chair):The Rt, Hon. the Viscount Milner,G.C.B., G.C.MoG., Secretary ofState for War:lieutenant-Colonel Sir Maurice Hankey,K.CB., Secretary, War Cabinet:Lieutenant-Colonel L.S.Amery, M.P.,APPOINTMENT QE CHIEF OE GENERAL staff, HOME FORCES.THE PRIME MINISTER asked the meaning of an appointment he had seen announced in the newspapers of General Romer as Chief ofthe General Staff.    Did this, he asked, apply to the British Ex-peditionary Force, and, if so, why he had heard nothing of it up till now?LORD MILNER explained that General Romer*s appointment was as chief of the General Staff in the Home Command, and had no refer-enoe to the British Expeditionary Force.TANKS FOR ITALY.THE PRIME MINISTER drew attention to a request that had beenmade from Italy for Tanks to be sent to assist the Italian Army in overcoming the Austrian machine-guns.    He said he had also seenthat Tanks had been asked for on an earlier occasion.LORD MILNER said that, as far as he knew, the requests now madeto us to supply Tanks to Italy were the first made to the BritishGovernment.    The earlier request, to which the Prime Ministerdrew attention, had been to the French Government, and as far ashe knew no simultaneous request had been made to us.lo
LORD MILNER undertook to inquire whetherTanks could now he furnished.AMERICAN ASSISTANCE.THE PRIME MINISTER drew attention to a telegram from GeneralBridges at Washington stating that the present intentions of theUnited States Government appeared to he to send only 2 divisionsa month from August onwards.    He also drew attention to the pre-vious telegram to the effect that all the American troops now be-ing sent over were being retained by General Pershing for the useof the American forces.    This, he said, appeared to be tantamount to refusal on General Pershing1s part to comply with the opinions expressed by the Supreme War Council.   American troops were pour-ing into Prance, but we had no guarantee that they would be avail--able for the present battle.   He asked if the Secretary of statefor War or the Chief of the Imperial General Staff had done any-thing to clear up this situation?LORD MILNER expressed doubts as to whether General Pershinghad in any way been consulted about the intention to send only 2divisions a month from August onwards.    He reminded the primeMinister that the Supreme War Council had, as yet, expressed noopinion as to what should happen after the end of July.    He hadbeen considering the desirability of asking Monsieur Clemenceau toget General Poch to send a telegram to America on this subject.With regard to the earlier telegram referred to by the primeMinister, his own view was that at the present time we were notin a position to train any more Americans than the 5 divisions of infantry and machine-gunners whioh were&quot; now in Prance, or arriv-ing there.THE NEST MEETING op THE SUPREME WAR-council.-THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had received a telegram fromMonsieur Clemenceau in regard to the next Meeting of the supreme war Council, in whioh he had drawn attention to the necessity of clearing up the situation as regards American reinforcements, andhad suggested that the next Meeting should be held on July 1st.a.
This was very inconvenient to himself, owing to the Imperial Y/war cabinet .   He suggested that there were strong reasons for askingMonsieur Clemenceau to come to England.In the subsequent discussion on this subject it was pointedou$ that General Eooh would probably not be able to come to Eng-land, and this would deprive the Supreme War Council of much ofits importance if the Meeting were held here.    It was also sug-gested that there would be considerable advantages if some of theDominion Prime Ministers could meet General foch .   The suggestion was made that the Imperial War Cabinet might adjourn for a week to enable the Dominion Prime Ministers to visit their troops in france, and that possibly in connection with these visits itmight be arranged for them to meet General Eooh.   It was pointedout that probably neither Monsieur Clemenceau nor General Eochrealised how great was the contribution of the Dominions to the effort on the Western front, and that if so any false impression on the subject might be corrected by a meeting.THE PRIME MINISTER and LORD MILNER agreed that, on thewhole, it would be neoessary for the next Meet-ing to be held at Versailles, but that beforesending a reply the Dominion prime ministers should be consulted.THE WESTERN ERONT.There was some conversation as to the reasons why the germans had not attacked on the Western front, and the view was express-ed that they were probably carefully preparing some new surprise.It was pointed out that they had had some two months in which toprepare an attack on the British front, and there appeared to beno reason why they should delay their attack, if it was to takeplace in the North.    The delay, therefore, created some supposi-tion that they might be reorganising their forces with a view tosas. a further attack in the South on the Erenoh front.   It was sug*.gested that the defeat of the Austrians on the piave might compel the Germans to send forces to their assistance, but, on the otherhand, the view was expressed that the Austrians had been driven
into retreat less by the active defence of the Italians than bythe difficulty of conveying supplies, ammunition, and reinforce^ments across the flooded river.RUSSIA -- THE QUESTION OF JAPANESE INTERVBNTIONoTHE PRIME MINISTER said that he had seen the Japanese Ambas-ambassador, who had given him some idea of the immense political dif-difficulties which confronted the Japanese Government, apart fromthe attitude of the United States, in obtaining a decision to in-tervene.    The Government had first to convince a Committee ofboth Parties, then they had to convince the Elder Statesmen, and finally the Emperor.   Moreover, there was considerable hostility to the scheme on the part of an important Opposition Leader, whohad declared himself against intervention, although two of hisnewspapers were in favour of it.    These difficulties, he pointedout, to a certain extent, explained the slowness of japan in tax-ing any initiative.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.*June 24, 19181
