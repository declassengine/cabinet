W&amp;g GAB I PET.I 2TO-223 OE A C02TVERSATION at 10 Downing Street, S.W. ,on WEDNESDAY,  JUNE 5, 1918, at 2.30 p.m.P r e s e nt:-THE PRIME MINISTER (in the Chair):The Rt. Hon. tihe Viscount Mi liter,G.C.B., G.CM.G-, Secretary ofState for War:General Sir H.H.Wilson, K.C.B.,D.S.O., Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff:Lt.-Col. Sir LI.P.A.Hankey, 1.0-3.Secretary, War Cabinet:Lt.-Col. L.S.Amery, M.P.,I REIiAND.RIME MINISTER mentioned that Mr. Long had stated therewere now 101,000 troops in Ireland, which seemed an unnecess-ary number in view of the recent proclamation and the postpone-ment of the question of Conscription.CONCLUSIQ N.GENERAL WILSON undertook -bo find out from Lord Frenchwhat serviceable troops, and of what categories, couldbe spared from Ireland.UTILISATION OF AMERICAN GUNNERS *GENERAL WILSON mentioned that we had lost a great many gun-ners.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that General pershing might be approached with the suggestion that some of the surplus Amer-ican gunners now In France should have a course of trainingwith our guns. l.
GENERAL WILSON pointed out that the American gunners train-ing behind the line lor field guns were using French guns, andwere earmarked for the French, but he might certainly apply for gunners to use with our heavy guns.CONCLUSION.GENERAL WILSON undertook to approach GeneralEershing on the matter,EWE kill A AIY SITUATION.LORE MILKER, resuming the morning1s discussion, pointedout that the fact that we have to let 3 of our divisions goastride the Somme gave us an occasion for putting the screw on general Foch to agree to the shortening of the line on theNorth.    With regard to that he wished to suggest that there might possibly be an intermediate line short of the St.  Omerline, -which would be equally short, if not shorter, and wouldalso be partially protected by floods.    He would like the mat-ter to be carefully gone into before a decision was taken.EES PRIME MINISTER said it was essential that both Lord Mil-ner and General Wilson  Would go over and insist upon a reconstruction-sideration of General FochSs present decision at a Council ofJar,  justifying the demand for such, a Council by the new situa-tion created by tne demand for the 3 divisions.    They would no doubt concentrate,  in the first place, on persuading general foch to sanction the shortening of the line; failing that, hesuggested that they should press for retaining some,  at anyrate,  of the American divisions till new American divisions wereavailable; thus two or three might be allowed to go, but the others kept back till further American divisions were readyto take their place.GENERAL WILSON mentioned that one of the American divisionswas just starting for Alsace.    These American divisions werethe ones which had been with British divisional cadres, andthey were taking with them all the gear of the British divisions,2.
but not the British cadres, so that the latter were availableto be immediately refilled with another 12   American battal-ions apiece and. to start away at once with the training of ad-ditional American divisions.LOAD MILNSR suggested that the most natural thing was to re-move the American divisions behind the Amiens-Montdidier front,but foresaw difficulties in the way of getting General Foch andGeneral Pershing to agree to a change in the programme whichhad already been settled..GENERAL 111501 thought that General Aoca. probably did notthink the Americans good enough for the battle area and pre-ferred to send them to a quiet part of the line and get backtheir equivalent in French divisions.    lor a similar reason hewas unwilling to agree to General Wilson1s suggestion that the divisions of the D.A.N. , should be brought down behind Amiens.As regards the latter, General poch might possibly think thatas long as they were there it gave him a better say in refus-ing the British demand for a shortening of the line.CONCLUSION.GENERAL WILSON undertook to make arrangements at once for himself and Lord Milner to cross on the following day, providing General Poch could, attend, and, Ifpossible, also M.  Glernenceau.    The plane of meeting to be somewhere in the Montreuil-Abbeville region.I WILY.THE PRIME MINISTER raised the question whether General Wil-son should go on to Italy.    The real crisis was not likely totake place till the Germans saw our reserves being withdrawn,and he might consequently have time to be back from Italy be-fore then.0 0 N OIUSI 0 N.GENERAL WILSON undertook to consider the question and meanwhile telegraph to Italy.POSSIBILITY OF EVACUATING TROOPS FROM FRANCE.There was some discussion of the rate at which troops could
transported from France in the eventuality of a suddenaster.THE PRIME MINISTER undertook to speak to Mr. GraemeThomson with a view to the Admiralty and the Ministryof Shipping making a study as to what would he themaximum of troops that could he got out of Prance inan emergency.Whitehall Gardens, S-W.,June 6, 1918.
