Radoliffe,C.B., D.S.O., Director of MilitaryOperations.lieutenant-Colonel Sir M*P*A*Hankey, K.C.B.Secretary, War Cabinet.AMERICAN FORCES.THE PRIME MINISTER drew attention to our ignorance as to whatuse General pershing was making of the large forces being broughtover from the United States of America in our shipping.    He had heard that in a week or two General pershing would have 4 more di-visions ready to go into action, but he did not know whether this information was reliable.    If correct it was of great importance,as it would mean that the Americans had the infantry and machine-guns of no less than 17 divisions in pranoe.    It was unsatisfact-orye he said, that we had not better information on the subjeot.He inquired whether the 7 American divisions in the line were oom-plete with their artillery?GENERA! RADCLIPPE and GENERAL HARINGTON said that within thelast few days they had learned that the last of the 7 american divisions had been completed in all respects -in regard to artil-lery.    They said that we had a very good representative at Gener^al Pershing&apos;s Headquarters, and they undertook to take steps to obtain completeinformation as to the use to be made of the Americaniorces.
- - 8.1PLAN OE OPERATIONS EOR 19190THE PRIME MINISTER asked what was being done in regard to thepreparation of the military plans: of operations in 1919?GENERAL HARINGTON read a telegram that had just been receivedfrom General du Cane giving some indication of General poch*s viewson the subject.    General Weygand had told General du Cane that itwas not proposed that the American troops should take over a seo-tion of the line this year, but that next year, when the questionof a serious offensive would be raised, the matter would have anew aspect.    The telegram also mentioned that American troops would be utilised in any offensive operations General foch  mightoonsider desirable this year. GENERAL HARINGTON said that theGeneral Staff had been carefully considering the question of offen-sive operations for next year, more particularly in connection withthe Tank programme, with a view to a representation being eventual-ally made to General foch .    This had involved a very careful con-sideration of the question of Tanks, and that it had been decidedthat the Tank organisation should be brought into the Army organ-isation, instead of being outside.    Moreover, the Tank programme had been carefully coordinated with the programme of other mater-ial.   what was being aimed at was an attack by divisions,of whioh )        would be British.    It was hoped to train the Tanksbeforehand.    The next step was to submit the scheme to the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff, who had not yet gone into it fully,and GENERAL HARINGTON hoped to have his plan ready on his return.After this he hoped that a general plan would be submitted toGeneral Pooh for his consideration, and that it would explain theproposed use of Tanks with the British Army and the extent towhioh we could supply Tanks to assist our Allies.THE PRIME MINISTER asked if operations in other theatres hadbeen considered?   He asked if the General staff were sure thatthe Germans were not going to break off operations on the western front and go elsewhere, for example, to Russia, just as Napoleon2.
after concentrating his forces at Boulogne,when he recognised thatthe invasion of England was impossible, had diverted them east-wards.    He asked what the General staff would do in such an event?Would they merely go on hammering at the western front, or wouldthey follow the German lead?   He asked if they had considered/thepossibility of knocking out Austria, or Turkey?   would it not bepossible, he asked, to get rid of Germany&apos;s Allies before concen-trating on Germany herself?MR BONAR LAW, in this connection, drew attention to two tele-grams that had been received from Sir Rennell Rodd in regard toan alleged Austrian peace moveeGENERAL RARINGTON said the General Staff had not overlooked these possibilities, and that elaborate railway programmes were being work-ed out in order to have an alternative plan to meet different con-tingencieSoTHE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that if the Americans concentrat-ed a great Army on the Western front next year, it might be possi-ble for our Army to follow out its traditional rcie of operating on the outskirts of the war area.    He asked if anybody was study-ing the bearing on the question of man-power, equipment, lines ofcommunication, &amp;c?GENERAL HARINGTON said a great deal of work had been put intothe lines of communication.    Among other things it had been arrangeed that a larger proportion of reserve stores than heretoforeshould be kept in this country.THE PRIME MINISTER then asked if anyone was studying the ques-tion of German camouflage?   Had anybody been turned on to studythat question?   He pointed out that every success the Germans had won had been due to a surprise.GENERAL HARINGTON said he could supply a very good report onthat.    He also had a very good report from General Mitchell on thesubject of the Austrian attempt to apply German methods.    Thisreport was particularly instructive, because the Austrian failurehad enabled us to discover a good deal of what they had aimed at.3o
&apos;-    83THE PRIME MINISTER then asked what steps were being taken to or-ganise the training of our troops for next yearYs operations?   he pointed out that the G-erman successes had been,in the main,due tosuperior training.GENERAL RADCLIFFE said that the German training was on the wholeless specialised than ours.   Before our attacks last year troops had been rehearsed on prepared ground and had been instructed tinmodels, plans, &amp;c.    This, he said, had tended to atrophy the cap-aoity of our troops for open warfare.GENERAL HARINGTON said that General Max$e, who was a most ex-cellent trainer of troops, had just been appointed for this spec-ific objeot.THE PRIME MINISTER then asked for a Memorandum on the lessons of the present campaign.    He suggested that Versailles, if proper-ly strengthened, could be used a great deal more than at present.He considered that it must have a stronger staff.SIR MAURICE HANKEY suggested that it would be difficult to getreally practioal results from Versailles unless General poch wasassociated with it in some way or another.THE PRIME MINISTER asked that:-Separate Memoranda might be prepared on allthe subjeots mentioned above, and General Rar-ington and General Radcliffe undertook thatthis should be done.THE DIVISION RE-FORMED IN ENGLAND.GENERAL HARINGTON told the Prime Minister that the new divisions which had been re-formed in England out of the cadres of divisionssent baok from the front and filled up mainly with B. men and witha sprinkling of Ao men were inferior in quality.    Reports statedthat the physique of the men was poor, and that they lacked train-ing,THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that the Germans did not put their older men into a special divisions, but that they mixed them up with the younger men in other divisions, and he understood theFrench were now doing the same thing.Whitehall&apos; Gardens, S.W.,July 4, 19184--
