Hon.  the Yiscount Milner,S.O.B., S.O.M.U., Secretary ofState for War:General Sir H.H.Wilson, B.C.B., D.S.O.,Chief of the Imperial General Staff:Ma jor-General Sir G.M.  .

the PRIME MINISTER drew attention to an article publish-ed by the &quot;Morning Post&quot; on May 14th, from their Paris Corres-correspondent, suggesting that General Mackensen was coming to theWestern front with 600,000 men from the Russian front, andthat 500,000 Austrians had been concentrated in the Tyrol foran attach on the Italian front.GENERA! MACDONOGH said  that General Mackensen was a bogeywho&apos;was always reported to be everywhere except where he real-ly was.    He was said to have appeared on the Western front, onthe Italian front, and on the Turkish front, while all thetime he was at Odessa.    He himself estimated that 11 good di-visions could still he brought over by the Germans from theEastern front.    The total number of German divisions on theEastern front was 34, hut except for the 11 he had mentionedthey were indifferent material.    ifeeyv could be completed to.. full strength, however,THE PRIME MINISTER inquired how the Germans could main-tain these large forces.    At the outset we had been told thatthey had only 400,000 reserves, and their casualties must al-ready amount to that.GENERAL macdonogh agreed that the casualties could notbe much below 400,000, but he pointed out that this figuredid not include returned wounded, of whom there were largenumbers, not only from the present battle, but from the bat-ties of last autumn.    In addition, perhaps as^ many as 50,000.,..prisoners -wer^e&quot;returning from Russia/    Count Mirbach had only recently protested to M.  Trotsky against the slow rate atwhich the prisoners were returning.    The Germans were not re-leasing any Russian prisoners.The alleged number of 500,000 Austrians in the Tyrol was-    . absurd.    The Austrians now had 49:i- divisions on the &quot;Italianro-r^J -----^ 9&apos;r-., M,., /front,/&apos; and 7f^ divisions altogether. They were, however, re- &apos;A / organising their Army, and. instead of the old plan of 4 bat- * batalions
in a regiment, and 4 regiments in a division,  the new divi-sions would: be reduced &quot;t0/^ battalions.    Consequently, thenumber of 100 Austrian divisions which the King of Spain had lately asserted that he knew to exist, -wssr not/an impossibleTfigure/i    Some of the Austrian troops might be unreliable, butit had to be borne in mind that a large proportion of the mal-contents had laid down their arms earlier in the WareExcept for artillery, there were no Austrians on the West-era front. On the Italian front we had as yet no definite news of a forthcoming Austrian offensive.    There had been somestrengthening of the Austrian forces in the Trentino, but no-the thing like half a million, /most probable&quot; front of attack onthe Italian front was East of lake Garda, towards Verona, dormthe Val Lagarina.    Tactically, however, this was a difficultfront on which to attackt and he doubted if the Austrians could achieve much without German assistance.GENERAL WILSON pointed out that the greatest sign of weak-ness in Austria was in their failure to attack since March 21oThis must be very galling to the Germans, particularly as they knew that British and French, and even Italian divisions hadbeen withdrawn from that front.GENERAL MACDONOGH said that there were no German divisionsOla-. /:   -on the AAis4;r-ian-. front, and at present there were not more than2 German divisions unaccounted for^v ff&amp;e.-^-&apos;^&quot; V-z^-^*-*-.On the Palestine front there were 4%t&amp;&amp;&amp; Germans/in whatis known as a pasha formation;    He had received reports of Ger-A,man and Austrian troops going down the Bagdad railway.    Thenumber was given as 70,000s but this was probably greatlyexaggerated, and he thought an outside correct estimate wouldbe 10,000.    The reports came both from Constantinople andEski Sheir.    The destination of these troops was probablyPalestine.    Sooner or later, no doubt, the Germans would try and drive us out there0
GENERAL WILSON thought our position was all right inPalestine.    She Indian troops with which the British divisions were being diluted, though not equal to Germans, had shown them-selves capable of dealing with Turks.GENERAL MADDONOGH informed the Prime Minister that such information as he had pointed asi to the conclusion that Ger-man public opinion was not satisfied with the offensive.    Heproduced a telegram from a reliable agent indicating that Hin-denburgl regarded it as a mathematical certainty that he wouldcapture the Channel Ports by August.GENERAL WILSON pointed out that he had always told thePrime Minister that the Germans would not attempt an offensive on the Western front unless they did feel confident that theycould achieve a great success.    General foch  did not share/tfeats-viewoINTERCHANGE OE INTELLIGENCE WITH THE FRENCH.The agent&quot;s letter referred to above led to an inquir^oythe Prime Minister as to the arrangements for exchanging in-telligence between the British and French Staffs.GENERAL MACDONOGH said that there was a regular interchange of all intelligence except the most secret from agents.THE PRIME MINISTER considered that the French General staff should receive the gist of information even from the most se-cret sources, although&apos;, care should be taken to cover the sourcefrom which it came.GENERAL MAODQNOGH undertook to see that general foch had a, paraphrase of the agentrs informationquot ed above.GERMAN FORCES ON EASTERN FRONT.GENERAL MACDONOGH said that he estimated the number of Ger-man rifles on the Russian front at 350,000, of whom about one-third were is^Mfcrly good troops.    According to a telegram just received the Russians claimed to have 150,000, but he doubted whether the number was so large or whether they were of anyvalueo(GENERAL MACDONOGH withdrew).
FIGHTING STRENGTH ON THE WESTERN ERONT ON THE1st JANUARY,  1917, AND 1st JANUARY,  1918.LORD MILKER said that a mistake had &quot;been discovered in thefigures given by Mr. Maopherson as the basis of his statement in the House of Commons that the fighting strength of the Brit-ish Army on the Western front was greater on January 1, 1918,than on January ls 1917.    As a matter of fact, the fighting strength had been less on January 1, 1918.    It had transpired that the figures given to Mr. Macpherson included Britishtroops on the Italian front.    As the Prime Minister had usedMr. Macpherson&apos;s statement in his speeGh on May 9, he felt bound to let him know.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that he oould not be held responsible for an error which had been made in General Maurice&apos;department.
(GENERAL HUTCHISON entered).GENERAL HUTCHINSON said that the United States troops were corning along well.    He had found all the officials verymodest, admitting that they had made serious mistakes in thepast, and doing their best to repair them.    They were, to agreat extent, in the hands of General Pershing.    General Per-shing, however,  could not feed more troops than those provided in his original programmeo    Hence,  the American troops that were attached to British units could not be fed unless they remained with us.    The Americans had pressed us to give them more ships so that they could feed more men, but Mr.  GraemeThomson had declined.    Mr. Btettinius had told him there theAmerican artillery programme was going to break down.    Thiswas due to their having neglected the advice given them whenthey entered the .7ar.    They had plenty of trained artillerypersonnel, but noV guns for them.    The first thing to be done,therefore , was to induce the Americans to train /their artil-lery/as infantry, replacing them in July by the new draftsthat were now being called up.    In May the Americans had ar-ranged to call up 250,000 men.    The American General Growther,who dealt with these matters in the ,.rar Department, had told him that he could have called up 3piie^3g&amp;0 men, but for^/the shortage of clothing and equipmeht2/ The Administration was reluct-ant to call up men until they could be fed. and clothed, lest the inadequacy oi their arrangements should be discovered.the prime MINISTER suggested it might be helpful to the americans for him to make a speech pointing out how, in theearly part of the War,  our own men under training remained fora long time without uniform or equipment.GENERAL HUTCHINSON agreed that this would be useful.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that we might have 150,000men here for training.GENERA! HUTCHINSON pointed out that we were limited as tonumbers by shipping, and it was better to bring trained men,
&quot;**   .*....   *Jsufficient numbers of whom were available, to fill all theships.    No one in the American Jar Department had appeared tO/p,know how many trained men there were/, but General Jervey afe &apos;    ;the War College had given the number as 420,000 infantry.    17regiments of these were earmarked for home defence.    GENERALHUTCHISON had persuaded the Americans not to lock up the menin these 17 regiments, but to use them for drafting purposes,as well as for training and Home Defence.    In addition therewas one cavalry division on the Mexican border commanded byGeneral Mt&amp;&amp;&amp;,    Colonel House had told him that there would beno shortage of trained men, and that all available shipping would be sent over filled with men.    He had not seen PresidentWilson.    Mr. Daniels, the Secretary of the Navy, who was adistant relative of his, and was formerly inclined to limit the American effort, had now publicly declared himself?in fa-vour of enlisting every man they could.    Arrangements had beenmade to call up men as fast as possible up to 1,500,000, whichwas the limit sanctioned by Congress.    GENERAL HUTCHI0SON had told them that they ought to have 5,000,000 men examined,classified, and ready to be called up.    The American militarydrafting and training machinery was inadequate.    They had tried to train men in battalions and divisions before they weretrained as individuals.    Among the most notable persons engagved on military matters, GENERAL HUTCK1PS0N mentioned Mr. Stet-tinius, General Goethals, both of whom were Under-Secretaries;General Jerveys, who corresponded partly to the Director ofStaff Duties, and partly to the Adjutant General, and GeneralMarsh, the Chief of the General Staff,the latter of whom, how-ever, had not greatly impressed him.    GENERAL HUTCHINSON saidthat the troops on board the &quot;Acquitania&quot; had been excellent.The older officers took matters seriously, and were anxiousto do their bit, but the young officers had not impressed himfavourably.    He had found officers of all ranks ami ous to
fight in one Army with the British.    He drew attention to the propaganda in the United States of America to belittle theBritish effort.As a respecting.lt of this discussion, the following conclusions were reached:-fl) General Hutohinson undertook to give the Prime Minis-ter a report containing suggestions for expediting thedespatch of troops from the United States of America:( ) The Secretary was directed to invite Mr.  Graeme Thorn-son to submit a report as to any improvements that could be made in the shipping arrangements:(3) The Prime Minister undertook,  on receipt of the twoabove reports, to consider the advisability of send-ing a private telegram or private letter to lord Read-ing, impressing on him the improvements that couldbe made:(4) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff undertook,after communicating with Field Marshal Haig&apos;, tc/givethe Prime Minister a sketch programme forecasting thenumber of American troops that ^ught tev be brigadedwith the British army on various dates, \^(GRHRRAI HUTCHIHSOH withdrew).
LIAISON WITH THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA



 There was a short discussion as to the liaison arrangements with General Pershing.

 GENERAL WILSON pointed out that, in view of General Foch&apos;s position as General-in-Chief, it was difficult for us to attach a superior officer to General Pershing&apos;s staff.



COMMAND OF THE HOME FORCES.



 There was some discussion on the question of the Command of the Home Forces, in the course of which a suggestion was made that General Sir William Robertson might be offered the post of Commander-in-Chief in India, in order to release General Sir Charles Monro for Command at home.
