NOTES OF A CONVERSATION at 10 Downing Street, S.W., on TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 3, 1918, at 11 a.m.



Present:



The Prime Minister (in the Chair):

The Rt. Hon. Sir Eric Geddes, G.B.E., 

 K.C.B., M.P., First Lord of the Admiralty. 

Admiral Sir R.E. Wemyss, G.C.B., C.M.G.,

 M.V.O., First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff.

Lieutenant-Colonel Sir M.P.A. Hankey, K.C.B., Secretary, War Cabinet.



THE FLANDERS COAST.



ADMIRAL WEMYSS explained that Ostend and Zeebrugge were now of considerably less importance to the enemy than was formerly the case. In the earlier part of the War their submarines had used these ports freely. This was no longer the case. The Admiralty had authentic information that only a small number of enemy submarines now attempted passage of the Straits of Dover, and these practically volunteered to the duty. They had actually made use of the Folkestone gate to pass through. Although the influence of the enemy submarines operating from Zeebrugge was not entirely negligible, nevertheless, even if these ports were entirely blocked it would no longer make any great difference to us.

SIR ERIC GEDDES explained that these ports had formerly been used mainly for short-distance submarines. Since March, however, no less than 24 out of 43 based on the Flanders coast had been destroyed. The Admiralty had lately discovered 7 enemy sunk submarines which had not been counted as certainties by the Admiralty.



  


ADMIRAL vVEMYSS explained that the enemy had not me.de asmuch use of these ports,as might have oeen expected, for at-tacking our cross-Channel transports.    Since 3ft&amp;&amp;!ftew: no at-Atempt had been made.    The fact was it was easy enough for theenemy to get into the Channel, but difficult to return.    More-over, the blocking of the ports had probably hampered the sur-face craft a good deal.    The question which the admiralty were now asking themselves was as to what was the value tothe Germans of holding this coast.    Prom a naval point ofview there did not appear to be much in ix.    The admiralty had been discussing whether it was not possible that the Ger-mans might retire from the Flanders coast altogether if theywere compelled to shorten their lines.SIP ERIC GEDDES pointed out that if the naval apprecia-tion of the situation was correct the incentive for the enemy to keep the Flanders coast was not great.THE PRIME MINISTER said that this fitted in with some information he had received.    He understood that in a few daystime a speech would be made in Germany to the effect that theGerman Government had definitely decided to relinquish theirhcld&amp;HX on Belgium after the War.ADMIRAL WEMYSS drew attention to the significance of therecent changes in the Staff and Command of the German Navy.The Commander-in-Ghief of their Grand See Fleet had gone tothe German Admiralty, and there had been an entire change ofStaff both in the Fleet and at the Admiralty.In reply to the Prime Minister, he said that there wasno physical indication that the Germans were likely to retire from the Flanders coast.SIR ERIC GEDDES summed the situation up by stating thatthe enemy&apos;s surface craft have done very little good on theFlanders coast; the short-distance submarines have been soknocked about as to be of little value; the continual bombard-men t
1.10from the sea and &quot;by aircraft had made the Flanders coast a veryuncomfortable place;  and the only attraction for long-distancesubmarine craft wexe/rasas the barracks and repair facilities.A,He proposed to make a confidential statement to the Press onthis subject.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed that this should be done, butlaid stress on no suggestion being made that either Zeebruggeor Ostend were likely to be evacuated.    He was very anxious that the public should not be encouraged to believe this asthey were last year during the Elanders offensive.THE FIRST LORD agreed to oe careful in this respect.ADMIRAL WEMYSS said that the idea of setting the press to work on the matter was rather to put the idea into the minds of the Germans that these ports were of not much value to them.With this in view care would be taken to avoid any indication that the articles were inspired.MINING IN THE NORTH SEA.ADMIRAL WEMYSS explained to the Prime Minister on a chartthe position of the North Sea minefields laid by our Navy. Hesaid that &quot;the sofe passages which had been left for our ownvessels had, to some extent, been mined by the enemy, so thatwe could not use them as freely as formerly.    He described aminesweeping operation that had been carried o^^t by our Fleeton the night of the 31st. August.    The-trouble was that theGermans hadf delay-actlorsfmines which were timed to come up intoposition long after they had been laid, and sometimes after aminefield had been swept.    Another minesweeping operation wasbeing carried out today by one of our squadrons.    ADMIRAL WEMYSSthen described on a chart the arrangements for the Northernbarrage.    So far as the Admiralty information went the onlycraft that had tried to effect a passage had been damaged by our mines.    He then explained in some detail the arrangements
Illby which the Western end of the barrage was provided for andthe passages which would be used by the Scandinavian convoy.(It is not considered advisable to make any note of these hig -ly secret arrangements)THe pointed out that if the enemy could not pass through theWestern end of the barrage without risk he would be obliged touse either the Westray Firth or the Pentland Firth, in both ofwhich submarine navigation was /Impracticable.A.THS BATTLE CRUISER DISPOSITIONS.ADMIRAL vvEMYSo explained certain naval dispositions that had been made to meet the possibility of German cruisers en-endeavouring to pass out into the ifer-thwSea.    He added that an american squadron had been based at BeisArjhaven in connectionwith the protection of convoys.MINE PROTECTION OF THE EAST COAST.ADMIRAL WEMYSS explained on a chart the mine barrage that had been created for the protection of the North-East coast of England.ANTI-SUBMARINE DEVELOPMENTS.ADMIRAL WEMYSS explained certain new developments of thehydrophone which are now being tested on a practical scale inthe North Sea.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,September 3, 1918.
