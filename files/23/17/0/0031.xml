P. A.hankey, K. 0.3. ,Secretary, War Cabinet.THE GERMAN REPLY TO PRESIDENT ..ILOOIW SThe Conference discussed Mr.&apos; Barclay&quot;s telegram from washington, No.4754, in regard to the German reply to Presi-dent Wilson&quot;s Second Note,THE PRIME MINISTER was apprehensive from the terms ofthis  telegram that President hilson, under the influence ofthe bellicose attitude of the American public, would sendsuch a reply that German opinion would be strengthened and allied opinion would be weakened.    The question arose, there-fore , as to whether any further message should be sent to president Wilson to reach him before he sent any further NoteME BALEOUR read the draft of a telegram which he had prepared, the gist of which was that the British governmenth oped that the lines of the President&apos;s reply would be, first1.
to decline further controversy, and, second, to state thatthe conditions of an armistice must be such as to preventthe resumption of Hostilities in conditions more favourableX to the enemy than those at present prevailing, and that,consequently the terms of an armistice must be laid down bythe Naval and Military Authorities.LORD READING- calculated from the dates of the variouscommunications that it would be impossible for such a tele-gram to reach Washington before president Wilson had issuedhis reply.0 0 IT C L U g 1 &apos; 0 IT.It was accordingly decided --To take no further action.jUiSTEY. MR BALE OUR said that he had had a visitEX that afternoonOonditionsfrom M.  Oambon, who had explained that the French Governmentof an Arm-istice.      were considerably exercised over our action with regard toan armistice with Turkey.    M.  Oambon had pointed out that theterms of an armistice with Turkey had been drawn up in paris and agreed to by the British, French, and Italian Governments.They included 22 points.    The British Government had, without consulting its Allies, decided that an armistice could, inthe last resort, be concluded by accepting only 4 points.    M.Oambon had represented that in form, at any rate, this wasincorrect.    MR BALFOUR said that he had discussed the question with MS M.  Oambon for three-quarters of an hour.    He had re-minded him that practically all the armies operating againstTurkey were British, to say nothing of the bulk of the naval forces.    He had reminded him that the British were not con-suited about General Franchet d&apos;EspereyTs negotiationswith Bulgaria.    On merits he thought that M. Oambon saw thatthe British Government had acted rightly, and he had under-taken to do his very best to put matters right &quot;with theFrench Government.
(EOkl) hlllfSd entered at this point) .THE PRIME MINISTER explained the situation to Lord nil-her, and said that,  in his vie?;, it would be very desirablethat Lord Milner should proceed at once to Paris &quot;to discusstwo points with 11.  Clemenceau:-(i)  To persuade II. Clemenceau not to make difficulties about the armistice with Turkey:and(ii)  To make representations to him urging him to moveMarshal Poch to talk straight to Colonel House aboutthe American Army.On the first point he urged that Lord Milner should remindMo  Clemenceau of the arguments adduced by Mr. Ball&apos;our, andparticularly of the action taicen by the Prench in the caseof Bulgaria, notwithstanding that the first flag of truce hadbeen sent in to General Milne, and notwithstanding that theBritish forces in the Balkans were just as large as the prench.    In spite of these considerations, General Pranchetd&apos;Esperey had not even consulted General Milne at all; hehad ignored him.    In the ce.se of Turkey, the forces were almost entirely British,    Moreover, we vrere dealing with a dif-ferent Government from tint believed to be in power at the timeof the Paris discussions.    The present Government was invit-ing the Allies to cooperate with them in throwing off theGermans.    The circumstances that applied in Paris were xe:xxtherefore not applicable now.On the second point, he wished Lord Milner to impress upon M.  Clemenceau the facts mentioned by Pield Marshal Haig,namely, that during the present year the Staff work of the americans was so inferior as to prevent them from achievingany considerable results, and that unless a drastic changeof method were made  chey would not be materially better nextyear.    THE PRIME MINISTER said that from all the information
which reached him,  the American failure had completely upsetMarshal foch &apos;s great strategical plan for the present year.He should remind M.  clemencoau  how, after President wilson had agreed that American troops should, he brigaded with Brit-ish and Prench troops, General Pershing had stepped in andoverruled him.    The result was that an amateur army was fight-ing a professional array.    General Pershing had refused tobrigade his troops with British and Prench; he had refused toxnterlard American brigades with British and Prench divisions;he had refused General WeygandTs plan of using Prench staff officers to correct the American inexperience, and, unless a change was made,  the same thing would happen next year.The result would be that great numbers of brave men would dielike flies without achieving any considerable results.    he advised xxxsh Lord Milner to mention the stories about horsesdying, and there being insufficient horses to bring up the artillery.    He should say that a first-class military scandalwas threatening,for the facts were getting known in Americancircles even in London.    He should make a strong appeal onthese lines that M. clemencoau  should use all his influence with Marshal Poch to make a representation on this subjectto Oolonel House.GENERAL WILSON said that Mr. Hughes had been &quot;co see himthis afternoon.    Mr. Hughes had heard that the 2 American di-visions were going to be pulled out of the line, becauseGeneral Pershing refused to keep them up) to strength.    Mr.Hughes had warned him that if the Australians were sent inagain in these conditions they might refuse to fight.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that Lord Milner, withoutmentioning such details,  should give a general warning to M.clemencoau  that both the British and Prench armies would be greatly discouraged if some action was not taken to enablethe American Army to pull its proper weight.    It was essential
that the representations should come from Marshal Pooh.LOAD III LITER undertook to proceed on the following day to Paris.The Conference agreed:-(i) That lord. Milner should proceed at once to Paris:(ii)  That the Chief of the Imperial General Staff should send a message to General Spears in pax-is, asking him (through the British Ambassador, if possible&apos;) to let II, Clemenceau know that very evening- that lord milner was coming over to discuss the question ofthe Turkish armisti c e:(iii) That the Secretary of state for Foreign Affairs should send a telegram to Lord Derby announcing Lord MilnerMsimpending visit, and that a telephone message hadbeen sent through General Spears., Sfiaitehall Gardens, oOct.  24, IS 18.
