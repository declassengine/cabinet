Of these 4 had never been in action atall;  the remaining SO had been in action on the Somme, andhad all had at least a month1s rest.    All these divisionsbelonged to the Crown Prince&apos;s Army.    Behind these the crown prince had, of his own Army, 5 quite fresh divisions, and 13which had not yet had a complete month&apos;s rest.     he crown prince,  in fact, had 35 divisions to draw upon for the of-fensive, without touching upon Prince Rupprecht&apos;s army tohis right.    The latter had 105 divisions all told.    If,  inthe next few days, it was clear that the Grown Prince wasnot drawing upon Prince Rupprecht&apos;s army, we might reason-ably conclude that the latter was contemplating an offensive against the British part of the line.1.
General Foch had brought altogether 24 divisions to face the offensive, mostly drawn from North of the point of at-tack, but not North of the Somme.    He had, however, warnedSir Douglas Haig that he might have to withdraw General Maistreand the whole or part of the D.A.N., and that Sir douglas haig would have to form a reserve of his own.IM3 PRIME MINISTER and LORD MILNER both expressed the op-inion that, when sufficient French troops had been drawnSouth, the Germans would attack us.THIS PRIME MINISTER quoted an article of Herr Dernbourg&apos;s,which indicated that the Germans had great contempt for ourleadership.MEETING OF THE SUPREME WAR COUNCIL.THE PRIME MINISTER stated that, in answer to a telephone message suggesting the possible postponement of the supreme war Council, Monsieur Clemenceau had replied that general foch Insisted upon holding it.
