Paper No.  900-B, bound up with CP. 348 (28)).A memorandum by the Chancellor ofthe Duchy of Lancaster (PanerNo.  CP. ^6lf (28)),  replying tothe memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (Paner No.  CP.353 (28)).The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs^made a statement to the Cabinet in which, after some general remarks on the present problem,he discussed the component parts thereof underthe headings of the Reply to the United StatesNote on the subject of the Anglo-French compromise-mise proposals (See Minute 2);    the renewal ofthe Arbitration Treaty;    reduction and limita-tion of Naval armaments-&apos;, and Belligerent rights at Sea.   He emphasized the extent to which thelatter question lies at the root of most of our difficulties, and outlined proposals.
After a discussion (which lasted the wholemorning and was continued,after a short luncheoninterval until 3.45 p.m.), in which theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Lord privy seal and the First Lord of the Admiralty took part, the question was adjourned for furtherconsideration after Sir Austen Chamberlain&apos; return from the meeting of the League of nations at Lugano .

The Cabinet had before them thefollowing documeiits bearing on the proposed reply to the United States Note respecting the Anglo-Preach compromise proposals forthe Reduction and Limitation of naval armaments:-A synopsis of the suggestedreply, circulated by theChancellor of the exchequer,(Paper No. CP. 354 (28)).A note by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs, covering draft replies to the Governmentsof the United States, japan and Italy,  (Paper No. CP. 571  (28)).The discussion in regard to this questionformed part of the general discussion on Anglo-American Relations, referred to in the previousMinute .In the course of the discussion the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs expressed his willing-ness to accept an alteration of the last paragraphin the draft reply attached to Paper CP.-371 (28))to read as follows:-&quot;For their part, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, deeply concerned at the failure to reach agree-ment hitherto, will always remainready to examine any suggestions which may be put forward with theview of promoting the cause of disarmament&quot; .Sir Austen Chamberlain was anxious to send the Note at once to the British Ambassador in washington, with instructions to him to consult the American Secretary of State as to whetherthe present moment was a convenient one for himto receive it.    In so vital a matter, however, he attached the greatest importance to unanimity in.the Cabinet, and, in deference to the doubts ofsome of his colleagues on the desirability of
taking this step at the present time, Sir austen chamberlain agreed that the decision should be postponed until after his return from theMeeting of the League of Nations.   With theagreement of the Cabinet, he expressed his intention that, if pressed on the flatter byM. Briand and Dr Stresemann, he would explain that in view of the confused state of affairs at Washington in regard to priority of discussion between the Kellogg Pact and the Navy Bill, and the delicate political situation created thereby,Kis Maj esty&apos; s Government deemed the momentinopportune for the presentation of a reply.Sir Austen Chamberlain, however, intended to impress upon M. Briand the importance of notdelaying any longer any attempt to reach asettlement on the subject of Land Disarmament,owing to the vital bearing of this question onthe German attitude towards the DisarmamentClauses of the Treaty of Versailles.   He proposedto point out that it would be a mistake to post-pone further consideration of this matteruntil progress could be made with the questionof Naval Disarmament, in regard to a great part of which a large measure of success hadbeen achieved at the Washington Conference.He undertook not to refer, in his conversations with M. Briand, to the proposals he had made inconnection with the question of BelligerentRights.Towards the end of the discussion, lord cushendun drew attention to the urgency of reaching a decision before long in regard to
the line to be taken by our delegates at thePreparatory Commission of the League of nations on Disarmament.
3. The Cabinet had before them thequestion of the announcement to be made regarding the type of cruiser to be builtas part of the naval construction programme,together with a memorandum prepared inthis connection by the Chancellor of theExchequer (Paper No.  CP. JjG (28)),  inregard to the estimates of the FightingServices, &quot;1929, as well as an extractfrom the Minutes of the 238th Meeting ofthe Committee of Imperial Defence,  (PaperNo. CP. Jl\-8 (28)), which had given riseto the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s memorandum.In addition the First Lord of theAdmiralty had circulated a memorandum,(Paper No. CP. j$84 (28)),  in regardto naval economies,  in which it was explained that, while hoping for areduction of  1,000,000 in naval estimates,ht; could not effect any really largereduction in naval expenditure except by changes of policy by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.The First Lord of the Admiralty laidgreat stress on the importance of an early decision, since at any moment he was liableto be ashed in Parliament whether tbe Cruisersin this year&apos;s programme were to be Class &quot;A&quot;or Class &quot;Bn .   In any event, however, he didnot intend to make an announcement unless hewas pressed in Parliament to do so.   He alsowished to place the tenders for certainconstruction, as this had already been delayedas late as was desirable.   Mr Brid geman pointedout that all the world knew of our intention
to build these Cruisers, and that the moneyhad teen voted.    The matter would never havebeen mentioned at the Cabinet unless he had thought it desirable to take the advice ofhis colleagues as to whether, in the presentsituation,  it was advisable to delay theannouncement in regard to the type of Cruiserany longer.    In these circumstances he depre-cated the raising, in this discussion, of anyquestion of policy.In the course of the discussion Mr Bridge-man expressed his willingness, in any announce-ment he might have to make on the subject, tocouple with it a further statement that inthe forthcoming financial year the Admiraltydid not contemplate building, any Class  &quot;A&quot;Cruisers, but a smaller type armed with 6-inch guns .Some members of the Cabinet, however,desired that the situation should be further considered in the light of new developments,such as the signature of the Kellogg Pact andthe financial situation.The Prime Minister undertook that adecision should be taken before Christmas.On this understanding the Cabinet agreed &apos; To adjourn the question, and thatno announcement should be made int he me an t im e.
4.    The Cabinet resumed the discussionof the resolution to be moved in theHouse of Lords on December 11th,  onthe subject of House of Lords Reform,  the text of which is contained in the conclusion referred to in the margin.After somewhat prolonged discussiona suggestion was made that the reply ofthe Government speaker should be to theeffect that the Government welcomed a discussion   not the less because the firstproposal came from a member of the other side;    that some considerable measure ofagreement was necessary before legislation on the subject could be introduced, andthat, in the meantime,  it was desirablethat the Government should reserve itsposi tion.It was further suggested that ifthere were a division, Members of theGovernment should not vote, and that theyshould deliberately adopt the line thatthey were not going to take up any definiteposition until a larger measure of agreementvras reached than at present.The Lord Privy Seal consented toact on these lines, upon the express under-standing that the measure of agreement he contemplated might mean no more thanagreement amongst the supporters of theGovernment.
us GASRDUSTRY.5.      The President of the Board ofTrade informed the Cabinet that forsome time the National Gas Council hadbeen pressing for the enactment oflegislation of an important character,which they considered due to themowing to the legislation recently enacted in favour of their rivals,  the electricity industry. /   Se had felt obliged, however,to refuse legislation oh any considerable scale/, but had encouraged them to reduce their requirements to more modestproportions, with a view to thepreparation of a non-controversial bill.The Cabinet agreed -That the President of theBoard of Trade should beauthorised to prepare a bill which should, as far aspossible, be non-controversialin character;    should agree it with the Gas Council;    shouldhave it put down forconsideration by the Houseof Lords;    that this action should be taken on theunderstanding with the gas council that it would onlybe taken in the House ofCommons if it was agreed tobe non-controversial.WhiteJohall Garder-s , S ,W. 1 .7th December,  1923.
