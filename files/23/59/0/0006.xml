The Acting Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs brought before the Cabinet the questionof the supply of motor-boats and submarine minesto the Soviet Government, on the subject of whichthe Foreign Office had been approached by MessrsVichers.As the result of a Cabinet decision on January29th, 1926 (Cabinet 2 (26), Conclusion 6), MessrsVickers were informed on February 3, 1926, thatther^ would be no objection to such export.    Theorder, however, was never actually executed.   MesszsViokers raised the question again early in 1927,and were informed on March 25,  1927, that if theywere referring to the order already sanctionedthere would be no objection to a licence, but thatif permission was being requested for a new oradditional order for similar equipment a licencecould not be granted.    The original order was neverexecuted .The present order would be for 5 to 10 motor-boats, each with five 37 millimetre guns (to beused mainly aa patrol boats to prevent smuggling),mid for a number of submarine mines not exceeding500. Messrs Vickers were anxious to know what theattitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government was likely tobe before attempting to secure the order.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To invite the First Lord of theAdmiralty to circulate a Memorandumon the Naval aspects of the question,and more particularly as to whether there was any risk of the war material in question being used against british fishing vessels on the Murman Coastor the Naval Patrols protecting them:(b) That the subject should be placed onthe Agenda of the next regular weekly meeting, when it was hoped the Presl-dent of the Board&apos;of Trade would be present and the Admiralty memorandum would be available.w, ..J... -
jFHE INDIANj OONTRIDUTOI TO home EFFECTIVEkOFARGES OPI THE british   ARMY.(previous references:Cabinet 30(88), Con-elusion 10,and Cabinet31 (28), Con-clusion 2.)2. Consideration of tbe Report of tbe CabinetCommittee on tbe Indian Contribution to HomeEffective Charges of the British Army (paper cp.,-338 (28)) and of the Secretary of State forIndia1 s Memorandum on the same subject (paper cp,-341) was postponed until the next regular weekly Meeting of the Cabinet owing to the absenceof the Secretary of State for War.
3., The Cabinet had before them the followindocuments on the question of Preference inGovernment Contracts:-A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs (paper cp.-300 (28)), in which Mr Amerysuggested a definite announcement in Parliament that in futurepreference in contracts would begiven in accordance with fixedand known principles and on fixedand published percentages both for home and Empire products:A Note by the Chancellor of theExchequer (Paper CP .-335 (28))covering a Memorandum by theTreasury in&quot;&quot;1 which was included the following quotation from theMinutes of the Contracts Co-ordinating Committee on the 27thJuly, 1923:-&quot;It was recommended that adefinite maximum percentageof preference should not befixed, that it was preferable for each case to be consideredoh its merits and with due regard to the aggregate cost which the preference would cost ..a,...    The Committeewere definitely of opinionthat no public announcement-should be made, as suchannouncement would tend undulyto restrict competition and toraise prices&quot;.The Treasury further submitted that nothing had happened since 1923 to warrant any revision of the abovepolicy.   Mr Amery&apos;s proposals, intheir opinion, would deprive con-tracting departments of the discre-tion to give a smaller preferencewhen, owing to the operation of a&quot;ring&quot;, no bona fide competition between British manufacturers exists,and the result would almost certainly be to raise prices in the far more numerous cases where a preference of much leas than 25 per cent, atpresent suffices:A Note by the Minister of Labour(Paper C,P,-342 (28)) suggestinggeneral rules, modelled on thepractice of some private businesses,which might be laid down for Govern-ment Departments on the assumptionthat a fair degree of uniformityis desirable.
In the course of the discussion the attentionof the Cabinet was drawn to the following passage in paragraph 2 of the Treasury Memorandum:-&quot;As matters now stand, the contractingDepartments reserve the right, with treasury sanction, if necessary, togrant a preference even in excessof 25 per cent, in very special cases;and, as a result of present policy,the percentage of orders placedabroad is very small indeed.&quot;After considerable discussion the cabinet agreed(a) That the existing practice shouldcontinue, but that in future no     ,   ..contract should be placed sfere^CTUX^ltJUjfcwLwithout the sanction of the Depart-      &quot; vtvlvl/aJLmental Minister: ^jfw*-(b) That the Secretary should communi-cate this decision to departmental ministers concerned who are not members of the Cabinet.

He asked for the authority of theCabinet to despatch a telegram to the Dominions..stating that the preliminary documents would beready in a month, that the next meeting of theImperial Conference was not likely to take place before the early part of 1930, and that the most appropriate time for the meeting of the expert committee and Sub-Conference would be in the early autumn of 1929 .Mr Amery also raised in his Memorandum thequestion of whether it might be wise to sound theCanadian Prime Minister privately on the questionwhether the meetings should take place at Ottawa.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the next Meeting of the ImperialConference was not likely to take place;    before 1930:(b) That the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs should have authorityto despatch the telegram to theDominions attached to 0.P.-329 (23),and summarised above, subject to the omission, in the fourth paragraph ofthe message, of the words &quot;early partof&quot; before *1930*:
