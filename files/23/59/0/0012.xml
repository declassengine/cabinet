r^HB KTNG*S 1. The Prime Minister informed his colleaguesTLIKBSS .that he had just received a message frort Lord(previous Stamfordham, who reported that the improvementReference:Cabinet 56 in the King&apos;s condition continued, that His(28),  Con-conclusion 1.)      .

supplementary estimates .(pr previous reference:Cabinet 1(28), Con-elusion2e    The Prime Minister appealed to hiscolleagues to do everything they could to avoidSupplementary Estimates, in view of the diffi-culties of the Parliamentary time-table.
9 9 fi4- o* 03. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,in the course of a statement in regard to theMeeting of the Council of the League of Nations atLugano, referred to the dispute and recenthostilities &quot;between Bolivia and Paraguay.   he hoped that the reports in the newspapers that both States were prepared to accept the mediationof the Urri-tod Sfta^s of America might provecorrect.   During the Council Meetings he himself had preached caution, but the South america andelegates had urged the Council that it wasnecessary for the League to intervene.    If theLeague treated American questions, they said,differently from those of other parts of theworld, it would be the end of the League so faras South America was concerned.   All that theLeague had done up to the present was to call the attention of the two belligerents to their obligations under the Covenant .   Sir austen chamberlain was clear that in no case couldBritish forces be employed in South America, buthe had asked the President of the Board of Tradeto examine what would be the consequences to thiscountry of an attempt to apply economic pressureunder Article XVI of the Covenant.The President of the Board of Trade interpolatedthat he was having the question examined indetail.   He gathered that there were Britishconcessions in the countries concerned,  and theresult of our applying economic sanctions wouldbe that we should lose th0 concessions, whichwould probably be transferred to citizens ofthe United States.   He would report fully to
the Foreign Secretary in due course.Sir Austen Chamberlain, continuing, said thathe was not yet in a position to ask the cabinet for any specific authority, but he had been warned that M, Briand might have to summon aMeeting of the Council at the end of the present week, and in that event it might be necessary for him to ask for a Special Meeting of the Cabinet.-4-
L d south AMERICA A. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs/,nd&quot;the league.reported the possibility that Chili would withdraw[previous from the League of Nations.   He understood that reference:Cabinet 9 the Chilian Minister had received definite ihstruc-(26), Con-clusion 2.) tions to give formal notice of withdrawal, butF  7-2 A*s) 8.       that before acting on them he was returning home to discuss them with the  Chilian Government.Sir Austen Chamberlain understood that Brazil was working to obtain the withdrawal of South Americannations.    It would certainly be a misfortune ifSouth America were divorced from the League.   Theprospect of the Pan-American Union on one side ofthe Atlantic, and on the other side the League ofonlyNations embracing/European and Asiatic nations,was not a pleasant one.
0 1&amp; cjGERMANY. 5. The Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsReparations.     reported conversations h^ had had with V.. Briandat Lugano(previous and Dr. S tresemanry on the main questions affectingReference: &apos;Cabinet 50       the three countries .(38),  Con-clusion 5.) As regards Reparation it had been agreed thatthe question was being handled successfully inEvacuation ofthe Rhineland. Paris and that it would be a mistake for the three(Previous        .... Foreign Ministers to duplicate them.   There had reference&apos;&quot;&quot;&quot;Cabinet 54       been general agreement, however, that it was(28),  Con-clusion 12.)    desirable to get the Expert Commission at work as soon as possible.The SaarBasin. M Briand had then suggested a simultaneous(Previous        execution of the other part of the policy discussedReferenc e:Cabinet 2       during the Assembly, namely, the establishment of(25),  Con-clusion 5.     a Commission of Verification and Conciliation inregard to the Rhineland, with a view to e-^cuationby the Anglo-French-Belgian forces.    In reply to dr. Stresemann M. Briand had said that he intendedcomplete and not partial evacuation.   Dr.Stresemannhad th^n made inquiries about the Saar, and M.Briandhad pointed out that that raised considerations  ofa different order and involved economic questions.He had also expressed a doubt on the legal questionof whether it would be possible to anticipate the plebiscite to be tak^n from the inhabitants atthe end of fifteen years as to which country they desired to be joined to.   In saying this Sir austen chamberlain thought that M. Briand was reflectingthe views of M. Poincare&apos;.   However, Dr. Stresemannhad carried the point no further.In some of the earlier personal conversations with M. Briand and Sir Austen Chamberlain Dr. Strese-mann had adopted rather a non-oos sumus attitudetowards the proposed Commission of Verification
and Conciliation,      At the meeting of the three ministers Sir Austen had defined the positionas follows:      If the Reparation experts could produce an acceptable plan and if a verification .procedure could meanwhile be agreed upon,  then thetotal evacuation of the Rhineland would followas -quickly as technical considerations allowed.M. Briand had agreed to this.      He had given theimpression that public opinion was rather tiredof the question of evacuation.      Twice M. Briandhad used the word &quot;liquidation&quot; in the Chamber andit had not been objected to.      Dr.. Stresemannthen pointed out that the word &quot;Commission&quot;was an unfortunate one to use in connection withverification, since it revired in Germany theidea of the Commission of Control.     M. Briandhad said that his idea was nothing of the kind.He had had in mind an entirely new departure,something comparable to the conciliation body which dealt with disputes between the United Statesof America and Canada,  in regard to which he had obtained information from Mr. Mackenzie King.M. Briand had promised to submit his ideas inwritine to Sir Austen Chamberlain and Dr.Stresemann.Summing up, Sir-Austen Chamberlain gathered that M. Briand not only desired evacuation, but thought that French public opinion was in such acondition that it could be brought to accept it.The next step lay with M. Briand.      When his proposals were received they would be carried forward as far as possible through diplomatic channels, after which a meeting of the three ministers might be. necessary.      He thought thatif the Germans would be reasonable and publicpolemics could be avoided,  an early evacuation of the Rhineland was feasible........._____..............-_-7- i .....-.................- 
Sir Austen Charter lain said he had notcirculated Papers since, undor present procedure,they would have to be circulated more widely than to the Cabinet, and he appealed to his colleagues to preserve secrecy on this matter.The Secretary of State for War asked that,in the interests of economy, he might be given as long warning as possible if evacuation were decided on.   He undertook to send the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs a Memorandum inregard to the effect of an early warning on thesettlement of claims.
REDUCTION AND 6.   The Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsLIMITATION OFARMAMENTS. said that in regard to Disarmament M. Briand,Meeting of during the Lugano conversations, had suggestedPreparatoryCommission. that  there was no object in a fresh meeting ofthe Preparatory Commission of the League of Nations(previous reference: until the new President of the United States wasCabinet 39(28),  Con- in the saddle.    Dr. Stresemann and Signor Scialojaclusion 19 .)had agreed, and M, Adachi had not objected.Sir Eric Drummond had undertaken to consxnlt theother Powers concerned in regard to a postponementuntil just after Easter, that is to say, in April.Nothing had been s ettled as to the programme which was to be Discussion-sed.    Sir Austen Chamberlainhad told M. briand that there was no opportunityto make any progress with the United States ofAmerica at the moment, and consequently that sofar as Naval Disarmament was concerned all thatwe could do was to adhere to the very moderateprogrammes to which we were committed.   He had pointed out, however,  that that was no reason for not pushing on with military disarmam ent .    M. Briaidreplied that he would consider this possibility,but Sir Austen Chamberlain was not optimistic inthe matter.Sir /usten Chamberlain also reported a conver-sat ion with Signor Grand!, the Italian ForeignMinister, who had adopted rather an apologeticattitude in regard to some features of italian policy.   The most interesting point in the conversation wa3 that, according to Signor Grandi,I^aly would have been willing to take the Anglo-French compromise as  the basis odiscussion onNawal Disarmament but had not done so as shewished to avoid being caught up into discussions
9 fl 9on land armaments until her relations with Prancewere better.   He understood that some discussions were going on between Prance and Italy on thesubject, more particularly in regard to the french colonial forces.
kLLIGSRENTI  GETS AT5SA.previous reference:Cabinet 56(28).,  Con-clusion 2)7.    The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that during the Conference at Luganohis Private Secretary had had a conversation withan official of the Quai d&apos;Orsay, M. Massigll.The latter enquired whether we were thinking of discussing the question of Belligerent Rights at sea with the United States of America.      It wasa most important question in its relations to article 1 6 of the Covenant as it would &quot;be avery serious matter for the League if theywere unable, owing to the opposition ofthe United States,  to apply the sanction ofArticle 1 6 in an emergency.      Sir Austenadded that the fact that the whole Continentwould be affected by the surrender of our meansof co-operation in carrying out Article XVI ofthe Covenant was a factor which had to be borne in mind.

NAVALIJS? RUCTIONjjjRAMME,nounc em en t,gardingCruiser?pe.pjfrvi ou sinference:satinet 55&apos;j)    Con-conclusion 3 .9 a The Cabinet had before them the following documents:A Memorandum by the First Lord of theAdmiralty (Paper CP.-390 (28)) urging that the only question before the cabinet is whether or not it can now be announcedthat the two Cruisers of the 1928 Prpgrammeare to be of 10,000 tons displacement;stating that the Admiralty hold the strongest opinion that, these two Cruisersshould be built now, and that if theGovernment wishes to preserve our equality with the United States of America in 8-inchgun Cruisers beyond 1932, three more oughtto be built in 1929;    but that if theGovernment are prepared to accept theposition at the end of 1932 of       178-inch Cruisers to 18 of the UnitedStates of America,  the Admiralty will be willing to lay down three 6-inch gunCruisers in 1929 which will be requiredfor Fleet work, and that if it is insisted on they are ready to announce this now.In the concluding portion of his MemorandumMr Bridgeman drew attention to the seriousblow to unemployment, a blow not confined to the Dockyards, which would result fromdropping the Cruisers:A Memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer (Paper CP.-394 (28)) referring to a statement which Mr Gibson, the Headof the United States Delegation at the geneva   Naval Conference, is said to havehad authority to make, namely, that theUnited States did not intend to buildmore 8-inch gun Cruisers than Great Britain:quoting a statement by the First Sea Lorda year&quot;ago that the four HAWKINS ClassCruisers should count as the equals oftwo Japan-se 8-inch FURUTAKAS, whichwould accordingly add two to the figuresof our 8-inch Cruisers;   urging, therefore,that neither parity with the United Statesnor the      5:3 ratio with Japan, and still less British nar.&quot;al safety, is endangeredby dropping the two Cruisers from thisyear&apos;s programme;    quoting statements bythe Prime Minister and Lord Cushendun inregard to the effect of the Kellogg Pacton Naval Disarmament;   urging that to drop the Cruisers would have a good effect-on Anglo-American relations, on british public opinion, and on achieving areduction of the Estimates of theFighting Services to  110,000,000 for1929;    and commenting,  as regardsunemployment,  that Dockyards must depend upon policy, and not policy on Dockyards.In the course of the discussion it transpired thatthe First Lord of the Admiralty, in the calculationsin C.P.-390 (28)) had allowed for the four HAWKINSClass Cruisers being counted as the equals of two
Japanese 8-inch FURUmAKAS .    It also transpired that the First Lord o^ the Admiralty was certainthat Mr Gibson had not made the statement attributed to him at Geneva, and that th0 suggestion that hehad done so had been made by an American officialonly in a verbal and unofficial statement.A very long discussion took place, in the courseo^ which the First Lord of the Admiralty and theChancellor of the Exchequer developed theirrespective views at considerable length.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsexamined the effect of the Chancellor of theExchequer&apos;s proposals on Anglo-American relations and reported that the view of his advisers in theForeign Office was that the effect would be favour-able both on Anglo-American relations and probably also on the Cruiser Programme to be adopted in theUnited States of America.The great majority of the Cabinet, however,shared the Prime Minister&apos;s view that to make a sudden, change in a programme which had been drawnup and approved by Parliament and the money votedearlier in the year, at the precise moment whenthe Senate of the United States of America is about to consider the American programme of constructionmight be regarded, in the absence of any ov er-riding considerations, as a calculated politicalmanoeuvre on our part with the object of in flu en c-ing the situation in America, and that consequently it might have the very opposite effect that we desired .
Soire members of the Cabinet who held this viewconsidered that the programme should be proceeded with uninfluenced by the American situation,while others urged that a final decision shouldbe delayed until after the Parliamentary Recess,when the political situation in America inregard to the Kellogg Pact and the Naval Pro-gramme should have cleared up.    This aspect of the question was adjourned to a Meeting tobe held later in the day.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,December 19, 1928.
