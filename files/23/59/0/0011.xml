TFS KTNG*&apos;S 1, The Home Secretary read a &quot;bulletin whichILLNESS.had just been published regarding the King&apos;s(previous illness.   Deep satisfaction was expressed at the reference:Cabinet 54 Cabinet at the slight improvement which had taken(28),  Con-clusion 1.)     place.-1-
AWGLO- 2* The Lord Rrivy Seal, referring to the   21 9WeCAHpBLr^IONS. discussion on Anglo-American Relations whichwprevious had been begun at the previous Meeting, remindedReference:I cabinet 55 his colleagues that three of the questions(SB), Oon-clusion 1.) brought to their attention on that occasion hadbeen referred to Committees under his Chairmanship.belligerentBights at One of the questions referred to had been underSeaconsideration by the Committee on DisarmamentPolicy,  and the other two by the Sub-Committeeof the Committee of Imperial Defence on BelligerentRights at Sea, and a large quantity of materialhad been amassed which was not yet in the hands ofthe Cabinet in any form .   While Lord Salisbury sawadvantages in a Cabinet discussion covering thewhole field of Anglo-American Relations, he thoughtit most important that his colleagues should keep their minds open until the Reports o^ the committees were before them.    On one of the questions referredto, provisional decisions had been reached, andgood progress had been made on the question of belligerent Rights at Sea, although Conclusionshad not yet been reached on all aspects of thematter.   The only reason for the delay in complet-hading these Inquiries was that he/felt it necessaryto postpone final Conclusions until the return ofthe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs fromhis travels.Several members of the Cabinet expressed theview that they could not form any opinion on thesequestions until fuller material was available tothem.The Prime Minister assured his colleagues thatthere had never been any intention to take hurrieddecisions.   He asked that the Inquiries should be concluded as soon as possible,  in order that their reports might be available to the Cabinet in thenear future.
HOUSE OP LORDS 3.   The Cabinet agreed  REFORM.That the decision taken at theprevious Meeting on the subject(Previous of House of Lords Reform, and reference: announced by the Lord ChancellorCabinet 55 in the House of Lords on the(2 8),  Con- previous  day, did not mean thatelusion 4.) the Government had decided toshelve the  question,  and thatthe Lord Privy Seal should beauthorised to say so on the resumption of the Debate inthe House of Lords .
4. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum,circulated as a matter of urgency on the previous evening by the President of the Board of Education,on the subject of the feeding of school children in distressed areas (Paper C.P.-388 (28)).In this Memorandum Lord Eustace Percy suggestedthat any programme of Government assistance todistressed areas which may be announced before christmas should include a special provision forthe feeding of school children in those areas, andparticularly in Durham where there is grave cause for anxiety.   His suggestion was to make a specialgrant to certain of the distressed areas whichwill relieve the rates of practically the whole ofthe cost of feeding, the grants to be given on conditions which would ensure proper administration under medical inspection.    He proposed,  therefore,that as an alternative to the existing percentagewe should offer a capitation grant equivalent to3d. per day per child fed, as a temporary arrange-ment continuing until next October.The Minister of Health informed his colleagues that the preliminary and provisional report of theOfficer of his Ministry who had visited SouthWales   a report which was still subject to the remarks of the Medical Officer who had accompaniedhim   indicated that he had discovered no case ofapparent sickness or ill-health due to under-feeding.   Women were suffering most and were found to require^longer period for recovery afterchildbirth, and there was an increase in ricketsamong the children, - a disease due not toinsufficiency but to the wrong kind of food.
990t*S Kj  iyjThe people were living to a great extent uponbread and margarine, which was not a proper diet.In spite of the rather unexpectedly favourablesymptom he had mentioned, Mr Neville Chamberlainregarded the position as serious and liable tobecome perilous at short notice.    Although not ina position to make final recommendations, his mind was worIcing towards a system of communal feedingapplicable both to adults and children, similar tothat which had been put in force during the GoalStrike.    The question of clothing was being dealtwith by the Lord MayorTs Fund, but it might bedesirable to supplement the Fund.    If this were done at all it should be done soon, and should notbe on a paltry scale.    Mr Chamberlain regarded itas a matter of great importance to avoid any actionwhich would result in a setback to the  generalpolicy of transfer to other areas where men couldearn their livelihood.   He also considered it important to harden the muscles and to employ the minds of the unemployed workers in order to fitthem for employment elsewhere.In the course of the discussion the cabinet were informed that the Lord Mayor&apos;s Fund at presentamounted to  135,000,  but the result of centralisingthe efforts of the different localities was that very wide demands were being made on the Fund at thepresent time from all quarters which had subscribedthere to .Proposals were made, first, that greaterpublicity should be given to a letter written bythe Queen on the subject, and, later on,  that theLord Mayor&apos;s Fund should be converted into aPrince of Wales&apos; Fund, which, it was thought,
9 9 9(C- i.j tJwould result in the raising of a much larger sum.The Prime Minister undertook to consider this proposal.The Cabinet were also informed that theMinistry of Labour were carrying out the transferpolicy at the rate of from 1,000 to 1,100 adultsper week.    It was suggested that-any availablefunds could not be better employed than in movingmarried men, with their families, as part of thispolicy.   The Ministry of Labour were already atwork in regard to the Minister of Health&apos;s pro-posal for hardening up men for transfer.   Inaddition, suggestions were made that the best formof assistance in the districts was to prepare men for emigration as agricultural labourers, but theCabinet were informed that it was extremelydifficult to provide facilities of this kind inthose particular districts.As regards Scotland the Cabinet were informedthat according to the latest reports there was nodestitution, but a good deal of hardship.   TheEducation Authorities were providing boots andshoes for children in that part of the country.It was urged that any assistance given by theGovernment should be administered through theexisting authorities .The Chancellor of the Exchequer emphasizedthat the revenue prospects did not encourage himto think that there would be any surplus ofrevenue over expenditure, and that if any consider-able additional expenditure were incurred theBudget would not balance.   He criticised some ofthe proposals from the financial point of view,and pointed out that in the aggregate they would
require some  600,000 to  700,000.The Cabinet agreed  (a)  That a Committee, composed asfollows:-The Prime Minister,The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Minister of Health,The President of the Board ofEducati on,The Minister of Labour,The Secretary of State for Scotland -should meet on Friday morning next to consider the question with aview to formulating a policy whichcould be announced in Parliament onthe following Monday:(b) That the Minister of Health shouldfocus the various proposals forconsideration by the Committee.
o 9&amp; l jHg IRISHpREE STATE.Contemplatedof Trusteein London .igsueStockj^PrevlousReference:Cabinet 53(28), Con-clusion 6.)5, The Cabinet had before them the following documents relating to the contemplated issue of trustee Stock in London by the Irish Free State:-A Note by the Chancellor of theExchequer (Paper CP.-366 (28))covering a Treasury Memorandumdrawing attention to the condi-tions laid down by the treasury under the provisions of theColonial Stock Act3 in 1900 inregard to such Loans, the thirdof which was unacceptable to theIrish Free State:A Memorandum, by the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs (paper cp .-374 (28)) suggesting thatthe best course to follow wouldbe to explain the present positionto the Free State Ministers whenthey come to London this month for the proposed Conference on questions arising out of ArticleX of the Articles of Agreement.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairsemphasized the point made in his Memorandum thatthe question was one of those which would have tobe considered by the Expert Committee which is tomeet,  according to present plans, next Autumn inconsequence of the recommendations of the ImperialConference, 1926.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Irish Free State couldnot be treated differently fromother Dominions, and that if they desired their Loan to haveTrustee status they must complywith the conditions laid down bythe Treasxiry under the ColonialStock Acts in 1900:(b) That the position should be explained to the Free StateMinisters when they come toLondon for the proposed Confer-ence on questions arising out ofArticle X of the Articles ofAgreement .
irisf6. The Cabinet had before them the following documents regarding Coir pens ation for Irish Loyalists(previous  religious reference:Cabinet 8(28), Con-clusion 7 .)A Memorandum circulated by theSecretary of State for DominionAffairs (Paper CP.-372 (28))reporting that the sum of  1,000,000previously approved by the cabinet would not be sufficient to meet infull the recommendations of theWood-Renton Committee, and that an addition of  50,000 to  70,000would be required to meet those recommendations on the scale laiddown in the statement made by theChancellor of the Exchequer on the20th February, 1928 (i.e., up to 1,000 in full and 60 per cent, ofthe excess over  1,000) .   It was estimated that to pay in full thetotal recommendations of theCommittee might amount to about 1,400,000, but that it was possiblethey might exceed this sum.    In thisMemorandum Mr Amery further statedthat he would welcome a decision tofind the additional sum required and to pay the recommendations infull.   He mentioned various alterna-tives,  but urged strongly that whatever decision was announcednow must be final:A Memorandum by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (Paper C.P.-379 (28))acquiescing, though reluctantly, inthe additional amount required topay claims on the scale referred toabove, but expressing inability torecommend the Cabinet to agree thatall Awards should be paid in full:A further Note circulated by theSecretary of State for DominionAffairs (Paper CP.-385 (28))covering a Memorandum by theDominions Office combating someof the statements in the Chancellorof the Exchequer&apos;s Memorandum.After considerable discussion the cabinet agreed, by a majority, - -That the additional amount/of  50,000to  70,00 0 required to meet the recom-mendations of the Wood-Renton Committeeon the scale laid down in the statement made by the Chancellor of the exchequer on February 20, 1928 (i.e.,. up to 1,000 in full, and 60 per cent, ofthe excess over  1,000).  should bemade available, but that beyond thisno extra provision should be made.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs asked that his dissent might be recorded.
9 9 7GIBRALTAR .proposedAmerie anMemorial at(previous reference:I Cabinet 49j (26),  Con-I elusion 3 .)7. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (paper c.P.-383 (28)) reporting the desire of the AmericanBattle Monuments Commission to erect in Gibraltara Memorial commemorating the wartime activitiesof the United States Navy in waters adjacent tothat fortress, recording the objections of theWar Office on the ground that the United Statesplayed so small a part in the War that the proposedMonument would be a subject of ridicule ratherthan of respect,  and those of the Admiralty on theground that there is no Memorial to the Royal navy in that Colony.    In his Memorandum Sir austen chamberlain urged that the American request couldnot be refused without giving gross offence andneedlessly  embittering our relations.A short discussion revealed that the proposedMemorial did not commend itself favourably to theCabinet, and suggestions were made that possibly the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs mightbe willing to discuss it with the american ambassador.   It was felt, however, that in theabsence of the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs and without hearing his views on theinternational aspects of the question a decision could not be taken.The subject was adjourned untilthe next Meeting at which theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs could be present.
8.  The Cabinet had before them the -annual report of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee ofthe Committee of Imperial Defence (Paper N0.C.I.D.900-B)    on Imperial Defence Policy,  together withan extract from the Minutes of the 258th Meetingof the Committee of Imperial Defence approving theReport.
