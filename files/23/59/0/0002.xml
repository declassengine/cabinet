parliamentarybusiwess.m(previous reference:Cabinet 46(28), Con-clusion 1.)THE KINCSSPEECH.(previous reference:Cabinet 42- (28), Con-elusion 12.)m2. The Prime Minister 3aid that he did not propose to raise the question of the businessof Parliament again at the Cabinet until theReport of the Cabinet Committee was available.The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed his colleagues that, as the result of further enquiry, the Treasury Evperts on the financialside of Parliamentary business had been able tomake proposals for reducing essential financialbusiness in Parliament to a simple form whichwould enable a good deal of time to be saved, ifconsidered feasible by the Cabinet Committee whichwas to meet the same afternoon.The Minister of Labour mentioned that therewere some points in regard to Unemployment whichwould affect the date of the General Election.He undertook to submit them to the Cabinet CommitteeThe Prime Minister expressed the view thatthe preliminary steps should be taken for thepreparation of the King&apos;s Speech, and asked theLord Chancellor to undertake the general super-vision of the drafting.The Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary to the cabinet should take the necessary actionto collect the material for theKing&apos;s Speech on the Opening ofParliament and should submit itto the Lord Chancellor with a viewto placing a preliminary draftbefore the Cabinet, if possible,at their next Meeting.
lUXT meeting of CABINET.3. The Prime Minister asked that the next meeting of the Cabinet should not take place onWednesday of next week, as usual, since he himself had to be away for some days.   The Meeting would either be postponed -until the following week or might take place on Friday, October 26th.
9 rrl^wpAPvA^IONS 4 . The Cabinet had bef ore them the followingMD ALLIED documents relating to Reparations and Debts:-(i) A Memorandum by the Chancellor of(Fr^&apos;ious the Exchequer (Paper C .P .-281 (28))Reference: covering a Memorandum prepared by cabinet 4-4 the Treasury on the subject of the[29.)    Con- discussions in regard to the revisionb In si on 5.) of the Dawes Settlement, which hadbeen taking place at Geneva and else-where.   In his covering memorandum the Chancellor of the Exchequerreminded the Cabinet that the Germans,in order to secure the evacuation ofthe Rhineland,  were anxious to concoctsome ne,;- plan for reparations, andthat the French, who had not yetratified their Debt Agreements either with America or with this country,would be no less anxious to devise ane-  scheme of reparations, hoping tomake their debt payments contingentupon its success.   Such a scheme mightwell suit their interests, but notours.    Caution was therefore enjoined.The Chancellor of the Exchequerfurther surges ted that our policy should be as follows:-(a) To adhere rigidly to the balfour Note principle.(b) To be critical of all schemesof revision unless they ensurethe complete fulfilment ofthat principle:(c) To make all concessions onour part either to our ex-Allies or to Germany dependenton equivalent- concessions bythe United States to us inrespect of our debt.Re warned the Cabinet, however,that there was no likelihood of thelast condition being fulfilled pendingthe American Elections or for a year at least after those elections,which made any financial negotiations at the present time likely to be bothfutile and dangerous .(ii) A Note by the Chancellor of theExchequer covering, for the informa-tion of the Cobinet, a Memorandum,setting forth the gist of a summaryissued by the French Government totheir Press stating what they hoped to get out of the proposed ReparationInquiry, the general tenor of which indicated expectations far in excessof what could possibly be realised.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed hiscolleagues that since the above Memoranda had been circulated he had had the opportunity of longconversations with Mr Parker Gilbert, the Agent-General for Reparation Payments, who had shed some new light on the question.   Mr Parker Gilbert was convinced that Germany would be able to pay 100,000,000 a year for a sufficient number ofyears to enable the Allies to discharge theirdebts to America.   In the coming year the germans would not only pay but transfer across the Exchangethe full amount due under the Dawes Settlement,which would reach its maximum of  185,000,000.It was uncertain if this could continue year afteryear, since Germany was at present borrowing large sums,, partly on short loans at a high rate ofinterest.   Hence, though the position was satis-factory for next year, there was not absolutesecurity for subsequent years.   If the GermanExchange, for any reason, were upset, it might beimpossible for the Agent-General for reparation payments to secure the necessary exchange to effect the transfer, and under the Dawes settlement in these circumstances he would merely keep theMarks in Germany.   Mr Parker Gilberts idea wasthat Germany should pay  100,000,000 a year andthat the transfer clause of the Dawes settlement should be dropped.   The question arose as to how this plan would affect the policy of the EalfourNote,   in the present year we should be receivingfrom Reparation and from Allied Debts as much aswe had to pay to America.    There was no reason for
our losing that position.   Under the Parker Gilbertproposal we should receive enough from reparation payments, combined with payments on account ofAllied Debts, to enable us to discharge our debt to the United States of America.    We should not,however, recover the arrears resulting from paymentsalready made to America.   But in any event thewhole of these arrears would not be received even under the payments provided for in the DawesSettlement.   Before proceeding with this proposalit would be necessary to ascertain definitely theattitude of Prance.   Mr Parker Gilbert believedthat M. Polncare&apos; was far more reasonable than wouldappear from the summary of the statement in theFrench Press referred to in Paper CP .-297 (.28) .If this proved to be the case, and Germany, asanticipated by Mr Parker Gilbert, was willing topay  100,000,000, there would be no objection tothe setting up of an Expert Commission,similar tothe Dawes Committee, to work out the details ofthe plan, though it would be dangerous to embark on such a Committee until there was some hope ofa settlement.   In these circumstances Mr Churchillsuggested that the first step was for him to seeM. Poincare&apos; at once and ask him. (i) if the 100,000,000 payment by Germany would be accept-able to France; (ii) if he was prepared to recognise--the British position under the policy of the BalfourNote; and (iii) if France was prepared to ratify the agreement made for the payment of the FrenchDebt.   If the answer were satisfactory, then Mr.Parker Gilbert, who would be going straight to berlin via Paris, would be able to ascertain how
matters stood in Berlin.   What Germany stood to gain in this arrangement was, first, the liberation-tion of German soil from Allied troops;    second,the liberation of Germs an finance from foreigncontrol; and, third, a.reduction of her annual payments from  125,000,000 to  100,000,000.In the course of a discussion on the above proposals the suggestion was made that it might bebetter for someoneless conspicuous than theChancellor of the Exchequer to see M. Poincare&apos;,but it was pointed out- that the Chancellor of theExchequer was the responsible Minister and could hardly delegate this important duty.   Moreover,all the world knew that a Conference of Expertshad been proposed, and it could be announced thatMr Churchill was visiting Paris in order to consult with       Poincare&apos; in connection with the settingup -of the Expert Commission.   Seeing that theBritish Empire and Prance, between them, receivedabout 75 per cent, of. Reparation from Germany, themeeting of the two Ministers ought not to occasionsurprise.The question was raised as to what answer the Chancellor of the Exchequer should give ifM. Poincare wished to capitalise a part of theGerman payments in advance of the other Allies, -a proposal which Prance had often made beforebut which we had been obliged to reject.    Therewas general  agreement that any capitalisation mustbe on the basis of the Spa Percentages.   There was general agreement also that it would be inadvisablefor the Expert Commission to meet in London.
The Cabinet agreed  That, subject to M. Poincare&apos;s agreement, the Chancellor of theExchequer should proceed to Parisat the earliest convenient date for the purpose of conversations on the subject of the proposedExpert Commission and the related matters referred to above.
ARBITRATION .Renewal ofArbitrationTreaties.(previous reference:Cabinet 28(28), Con-clusion 2 &amp;Appendix .)5.     The Cabinet had before them a Note by the acting Secretary of State for Foreign affairs covering a Memorandum prepared at his request bythe Legal Adviser of the Foreign Office (Sir CecilBurst) on the subject of the renewal of our Arbi-tration Treaties with several foreign States,which are approaching expiration. In this Memo-randum, however, the renewal of the Treaty withthe United States of America was reserved for separate consideration.  c.f*, 2?Q 3/        )In his Memorandum Sir Cecil Hurst, in orderfrom compulsory arbitrationto surmount the difficulty of excepting/disputesaffecting the vital interests (including belligerent-ent rights at sea) of either of the parties   acourse which has not been adopted in recent-Treaties of the kind and is unacceptable to manynations   made the following proposals:-&quot;That the basis on which our arbitra-tion treaties should be concluded wouldbe that of providing that all justici-able disputes should be referred tothe Permanent Court of InternationalJustice at The Hague, and that allother disputes should be referred toconciliation commissions, with afurther provision that if the parties are not prepared to accept the recom-mendations of the conciliation commis-sion, the dispute should be submittedto the Council of the League acting under article 15 of the Covenant.Then would come a further provision that, in view of the renunciation ofwar under the Kellogg Pact, any disputes arising out of belligerent action whichHis Majesty might be forced to take in self-defence or in co-operation withthe League of Nations should not bedealt with as justiciable disputes,but should be referred to the concilia-tion commission and, if necessary, tothe Council of the League.   It willalso be necessary to add a furtherexception as regards  disputes arisingm respect of countries in which GreatBritain has special interests, byreason of the necessity of maintaining the safety of her inter-Imperial com-munications
The Acting Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs informed the Cabinet that, with his authority,Sir Cecil Hurst had discussed the question informallywith the French and German draftsmen, M. Fromgeotand Iierr Gaus , with whom he was on intimate terms,and believed that they would be willing to recommend the Treaty on these lines to their&apos; respective governments.     Lord Cushendun himself,&apos;however, feltno great confidence that the proposal would beaccepted.     The effect of Sir Cecil Hurst &apos;s proposal was that what had hitherto been called &quot;vital interests&quot; would be reserved for conciliation treatmentinstead of going to the Hague Court.     That would not materially alter the obligations we had alreadyincurred in the covenant and existing treaties.In the course of tla.e discussion it became clearthat the Cabinet considered that the question requiredvery careful investigation from the point of view ofour vital interests.The Acting Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs said that he had in mind to arrange for a renewal of the French Arbitration Treaty, whichhad lapsed a day or two ago, for a period of a fewmonths, to enable further examination to be made ofthe new Treaty.     He reminded the Cabinet that theItalian and Spanish Treaties would expire early nextyear.The Cabinet agreed -(a) That the question of the renewal ofour Arbitration Treaties which haveexpired or are about to expire shouldbe considered in the first instance by the Sub-Committee of the Committeeof Imperial Defence on the question of belligerent Rights at Sea, which meetsunder the Chairmanship of the lord privy Sealj
(b) That the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs shouldbe added to the Sub-Committeeon Belligerent Rights *
6.    &quot;he Cabinet had before their, a Memorandumby the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Paper C.P.-284 (28)) covering, for the information and consideration of the Cabinet, a memorandum prepared in the Treasury on the subject of ex-Service Civil Servants.   In this memorandum the Treasury exposed the fallacies contained in aletter recently published in &quot;The Times&quot; fromfour Members of Parliament on the subject of notices of dismissal alleged to have been issued to a number of ex-Service men holding clericalposts in the Civil Service.   The proposals madeby the Union of Ex-Service Civil Servants for theremoval of the ex-Service Temporary Clerks problemwere examined in the Memorandum.   The third pro-posal, which took the form of a recommendation that ex-Service Temporary Clerks should beappointed, as the work on which they are engagedcomes to an end, in wastage vacancies arising inthe Writing Assistant Class  (Women), with all itsdefects was regarded by the Treasury as the least objectionable of ^he three demands of the Unionif it were decided for political as distinct frombusiness reasons to agree to any of them.    It was urged, however, that any such agreement, if decided on, should be subject to the proviso that the appointments of ex-Service Temporary Clerks toWriting Assistant posts should be regarded aspurely temporary, f-e   clerks so appointed being transferred to temporary clerical jobs as they became available.   Further, that it should be madea condition of acceptance of this proposal thatany ex-Service clerk who was found to be incompetentshould be discharged.
In the coiarse of the discussion a good dealof emphasis was laid on the administrativeinefficiency which has been experienced Incertain Departments from the employment as temporary Civil Servants of the particular ex-Service men in question, who were for clericalpurposes the least efficient remainder of thelarge numbers of ex-Service men absorbed intoGovernment employment.     On the other hand theCabinet felt they must not lose sight of ih efact that these men had fought for their country,and had thereby, in many cases, lost theiropportunity for a proper start in life .     Asuggestion was made that as many of these men aspossible should be placed In private employment *A further suggestion was made that perhaps someof them, even though unsuited for clericalemployment, might make good emigrants, andthat possibly their service in the Army and afterwards in the Civil Service might be held toentitle them to special claims for assistance.The Prime Minister asked the Chancellor of theExchequer to examine this proposal.
7.    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe President of the Board of Trade (Paper C.P.-296 (28)) on the subject of the Convention drawnup at an International Conference at Geneva inJuly last for the abolition of import and exportprohibitions and restrictions.    In this memorandum the President of the Board of Trade recommendedthat we should ratify the main Convention onbehalf of the United Kingdom at an early datewithout attaching any condition to our ratifica-tion, and that we should also ratify two minorConventions relating to export prohibitions and export duties on hides and skins and glue stock,which were to come into force somewhat before themain instrument, their enforcement being needed topave the way for the general adoption of the latter.Enquiry was made as to whether the positionof agriculture had been considered in drawing up the above Conventions, and the reply was inthe affirmative.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairsentered a caveat to the effect that none ofthe Dominions had yet agreed to ratify and,apart from the Dominions, he was particularly anxious that our ratification should not commit the Colonies and Dependencies .The President of the Board of Tradeundertook to secure this ,Subject to the above, the Cabinet approved the course proposed by the President of theBoard of Trade in CP .-296  (28), summarised above.
IMPROPERLITERATURE.8.     The Home Secretary reported to theCabinet action he had taken,after consulta-tion with the Lord Chancellor, for securingthe withdrawal by the publishers of a bookwhich he and the Lord Chancellor had agreedwas of an obscene character.     He also reported that after withdrawing the bookthe publishers had supplied a firm In Pariswith the t e clinic a 1 mat erialf or its publication,together with a list of the orders given forcopies, with the result that large numbers of copiesof the book had be en s ent to Englaad, whichwere at the moment being held up by theCustoms and Excise and by the Post Office.The Cabinet took note that the mattercame within the jurisdiction of the Attorney-General, who would be responsible for any necessary action.
9.   The Prime Minister informed the Cabinetthat at the request of the Minister ofTransport he had more than once seen theauthorities concerned in carrying out theproposal for the removal of the existingCharing Cross Bridge, namely the LondonCounty Council and the Chairman of the southern railway.     The latter wished the PrimeMinister to assure him thst in the view ofthe Government it was a desirable improvement.He was much inclined to give this assurance,but wished to have the support of hiscolleagues before doing so.The Cabinet approved the proposal ofthe Prime Minister.

The Companies had all been advised that it would be illegal for them to give anundertaking     not to exercise a statutory right.The ^resident had put to the Companies that adecision not to go to the Tribunal was no abandonment of their legal position, but was a commercialdecision within the exercise of their business-sdiscretion.     The majority of the Companies wouldhave been willing to take such a decision and give an undertaking now.     The London and Worth Easternheld that they could not take such a decision until they saw their figures later in the year.     ThePresident stated to the Companies that, if theyshould approach the Tribunal, the Minister ofTransport would be bound to appear and resist theclaim strongly, and that this would be an unfortunateprecedent to create.     Several   of the Companiesexpressed the view that it was very unlikely thatthey would approach the Tribunal,     It was clearthat nothing further could be done in the way ofobtaining a formal undertaking, but hs thought therisk of approach to the Tribunal was not serious.The President also reported that the followingrebates for the temporary period had been settled with the Railway Companies:-
