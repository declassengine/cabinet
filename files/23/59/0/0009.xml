EMPLOYMENT. STRESSEDREAS.previous reference:Cabinet 50(28)Conclusion 1.).2.   At the request of the Prime Minister,the Minister of Health gave the Cabinet an accountof the debate on the adjournment initiated by theLabour Party on Monday evening (3rd December) onthe subject of the Distressed Areas, and of theline he himself had taken therein,Mr. Neville Chamberlain explained how he hadkept in close touch with the situation in these areas, having received reports from specialofficers sent to the districts during the summer and in the early autumn.     Recently, however, hehad sent two senior officials (including a medical officer experienced in relief work) to these districts.     Their reports are not yet available,but from preliminary reports, Mr. Chamberlainwas beginning to think that unless charitableresources were produced on a larger scale than hitherto, it might be necessary to give some assistance from public funds.     He proposed tosend the same officers afterwards to Durham.     Asregards charitable resources, Mr. Chamberlainreferred to the meeting being held by the lord mayor at the Guildhall to-day.     Members of theCabinet commented on the desirability of improving the administration of the Lord Mayor&apos;s Fund bythe addition of some whole-time officials.In a further debate which was to takethe Board ofplace the same evening, the President of/Educationwas asked, in commenting on a proposal inMiss Bondfield&apos;s Bill for the provision of clothing for school children, to be careful to
avoid saying anything which would tend to dryup the voluntary efforts now being made..Lord Eustace Percy was also asked to bevery careful, in any hint he might give of possible Government assistance, not to go beyond statement that if the present system should prove inadequate, the matter would receive very careful consideration.The Prime Minister said he had brought the matter before the Cabinet as one of urgency,because if further Government action should become necessary,  it would have to be taken before the Christmas Hecess.     He asked theSecretary of State for Scotland to be availableto take part in the debate,  if questions relating to Scotland should arise.
3.     The Prime Minister asked the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs- and the Secretaryof State for Scotland to &quot;be available, if(-previous reference: required, to take part in the debate on theCabinet 49  (28),Conclusion 17).&apos; Imperial Telegraphs Bill, which was in chargeof the Postmaster General.
I2J0D3S 4.     The Prime Minister consulted the st.Cabinet as to whether it would be proper foreviousPerence: himself, the Lord Chancellor and the Secretary\inet 52 (28) ,(inclusion 9). of State for Dominion Affairs, who are all members of the Hhodes Trust, to sign the petitionby the Trust, asking Parliament for leave tointroduce a Private Bill.Mr. Baldwin recalled that the Cabinet had decided to support the Bill.The suggestion was made that a precedentwould probably be found in connection with the affairs of the British Museum, whose trusteesinclude representatives of the Government.The Prime Minister said he would have theseprecedents examined and decide accordingly.
TITLE OF HISMajesty&apos;sGOVERH;-.iENT.[(previous Heferen.ce:Cabinet 49(28) Con-clusion 7)&apos;5%    The Cabinet resumed discussion on the question of the title of HisMajesty&apos;s Government, and had beforethem the same papers as at theprevious discussion, which are summarised in the Conclusions of the meeting referred to in the margin.After discussion the Cabinet agreed -(a) That the title of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should be alteredso as to conform to the title of Parliament, and should beas follows:-&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United Kingdom ofGreat Britain and NorthernIreland&quot;.(b) That it was unnecessary to await the next Imperial Conferencebefore using the new title.(c) That no public announcement shouldbe made on the subject, but thatthe new title should be usedin practice from henceforward.In the course of the discussion itwas suggested that in course of time it wasnot improbable that it might be possibleto shorten the new title in practice to&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom&quot;, although this was impracticableuntil it had become generally realised that by the term &quot;United Kingdom&quot; vrasintended &quot;United Kingdom of Great Britainand Northern Ireland&quot;.
OBINIONJNISTBRS.efinition ofnotions of.previous reference:Cabinet^ (28) Con-elusion 5) *6. The Cabinet had under- consideration the question of the definition of thefunctions of Dominion Ministers atForeign Courts.      In addition to the papersbefore them on previous occasions on whichthe question was discussed,  they had underconsideration the following memoranda:-A memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs(Paper No.  CP. 235 (23)),containing a formula which Mr.Amery suggested should beadop ted;A memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs(Paper No.  CP. 294 (28)),covering a copy of a semi-official letter from the Depart-ment of External Affairs of theIrish Free State,  regarding theproposed appointment of Free StateMinisters at Paris and Berlin,together with a copy of the letterto which it was the reply.A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs (PaperNo. CP. 304 (28)),  covering acopy of a letter which he had sentto the Irish Free State Ministerfor External Affairs in pursuanceof Cabinet 46 (28)  Conclusion 5,as well as a copy of a letter whichhad been sent from the dominions office to the High Commissioner forGreat Britain in Canada.A memorandum by the Secretary ofStace for Dominion Affairs (PaperNo. CP.  520 (23)), covering acopy of the reply which he hadreceived from the Irish Free StateMinister for External Affairs tohis letter enclosed in Paper No.cp. 504 (28).A memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Dominions Affairs  (paper No.CP. 369 (28)),  covering copies oftwo despatches from His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the Union of SouthAfrica asking that the Governmentsof the United States and theNetherlands may be approached with
a view to the appointment of union Ministers in those countries;also copies of telegraphic correspondence with the ImperialSecretary in South Africa,regarding certain comments &quot;byGeneral Hertzog on the wording ofthe Note addressed by His Majesty&apos;ambassador at Paris to the FrenchGovernment on the 20th August, 1923,on the subject of the appointmentof the Canadian Minister at Paris.A memorandum by the Acting Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs (lord cushendun)  (Paper No. CP. 290 (28)) ,containing an alternative formula to that suggested by the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs in cp. 205 (23).The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs reported a conversation he had had on the subject with Mr. mackenzie king,  the Prime Minister of the dominion of Canada.      Before his conversation withMr. King, he had discussed the matter with sir 3sme Howard, who had reported thatthe presence of diplomatic representativesof Canada and the Irish Free State atWashington, so far from doing any harm,had rather strengthened the general position in that capital.      The AmericanGovernment had discovered that the difficult attitude, as they regarded it,sometimes taken up by our representative,was in fa-et due to Canadian pressure.Consequently the Ambassador had escapedthe odium of constantly troubling the state department,- and also of being unable toobtain satisfactory replies.      Moreover,
so far from any rift having appeared in the British Empire, the United StatesGovernment found that the three represen-tatives were constantly holding similarlanguages.At his interview with Mr. mackenzie king Sir Austen (Jhamberlain had cometo the conclusion that it was impossibleand unwise to resist the consequences of the last Imperial Conference, andthat the only way to obtain a goodworking arrangement was to accept themgenerously and largely.      It was on goodwill and common sense that we must rely.It had proved impossible in -practice toenforce the instruction to the canadian minister that he was not entitled to speakat Washington on a matter which happened to affect other parts of the Empire besidesCanada.      Consequently, while warning Mr.Mackenzie King that he would have to consult his colleagues, Sir austen chamberlain had undertaken to advise theCabinet on the basis of the formulasuggested by the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs in Paper No. CP. 23p&quot; (28),emphasising the importance of the diplomatic unity of the Empire, as wellas of close co-operation both between the diplomatic representatives of the Empireat capitals and between their Governments.Mr. Mackenzie King had been willing toaccept this.
hadSir Austen Charnberlain/also asked forreciprocity by Canada to the arrangement under which all despatches to and from london and foreign capitals which are of sufficient importance to be circulated to theCabinet are also sent to the DominionsPrime Ministers, and Mr. Mackenzie king had expressed agreement, and suggestedthat the Canadian representatives in paris and Washington should communicate copiesof their despatches on matters of general interest to the British Ambassador.Sir Austen Chamberlain had also spoken to Mr. Mackenzie King regarding the demandmade by Canada regarding the publicationof secret telegrams and despatches sentin connection with current questions.      sir austen Chamberlain had explained to him thatour idea in sending these documents was tokeep Dominions Prime Ministers so closelyposted up with information that realconsultation could take place between thetwo Governments, as between Cabinet colleaguesThis was not possible if there was always to be publication at a later stage.     Mr.Mackenzie King had inclined to the same view and had suggested that his Parliamentarydifficulty might be met by an exchange ofdespatches after the decision had beenreached.    t In this connection he had suggested that the British High Commissioner
in Canada would   be of great value.The Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster asked that his view might heplaced on record that in the long runnothing hut a rupture of Empire relationswas likely to result from the presentmovement towards separate diplomatic representation of the Dominions,      He wasnot moved by a report which Sir EsmeHoward had given to Sir Austen Chamberlainof his successful experience with theMinisters at Washington of Canada andthe Irish Free State.      General Hertzog&apos;sminute,  circulated in CP. j5^9showed the sort    of trouble that must be expected.      It could, in his view,&apos;  only be a matter of time before dis-unitywould be introduced, when serious troublearose.      He deprecated the emphasis tobe laid on diplomatic unity,  since the realmeaning of diplomatic unity was a singlechannel of communication, and once severalchannels were opened up unity would notin fact exist.      Australia and New Zealandwere opposed to separate representation,and in these circumstances he thought that atany rate no change should be made untilthe matter had been considered by theImperial Conference.The Cabinet felt, however,  that inview of the fact that separate representation
of some of the Dominions in certain foreign capitals already existed, it was necessaryto bring their instructions into harmony withthe constitutional arrangements agreed to atthe Imperial Conference of 192b, and thatthe position could best be safeguarded by providing for the closest collaboration between the Ministers of the Dominions andthe British diplomatic representative atalsoa foreign capital, and by/providing that inthe event of any difference of opinion the representatives concerned should atonce report to their respective Governments,who v/ould then concert an agreement.In accordance with these general principles the Cabinet agreed -(a) That the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs,  in concert with the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, should draw upa formula on the lines of thedraft suggested in CP. 285 (28),(b) That the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs should endeavourto secure the assent ofAustralia and New Zealand to these arrangements.(c) That the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs should prepare a despatch to the Dominionsconcerned, suggesting theadoption of the formula referredto in (a), and emphasising theimportance of collaboration between the diplomatic represen-tatives of the home Governmentandnof the Dominions at foreign capitals, and in the event oftheir disagreement, of reference totheir respective Governments, whowould be in close touch and wouldthen come to an agreement on the
question at issue.   He  shouldalso allude to the question of reciprocity in the exchange ofdespatches,  and to thedesirability of suitable arrangements regarding thefinal publication of telegrams and despatches on the linesdiscussed between Sir austen chamberlain and Mr. Mckenzie Kin,
HOUSE OP 7.       The Cabinet had before them aLORDS REFORM.memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal (Paper(previous No. CP.  3J3 (28)),  covering the reference:Cabinet 5^ following resolution to be moved by(28), Con-clusion 7) . Lord Clarendon in the House of lords on December 11th:-Terms of Lord Clarendon&apos;s Motion.The Earl of Clarendon.      To move,That having regard to the Preambleof the Parliament Act and to theResolution passed by this House on23rd June 1927,  it is hereby resolved:1.    That it is desirable that earlysteps should be taken to limit the number of members of theHouse,  and to make suitableprovision for ah electiverepresentation of the Peerage, andfor such other representationor nomination as would ensure to each political party a fairposition in the House;    and2.    That the following constitutionof this House would in the opinionof this House fulfil theseconditions -(a) 150 peers to be elected byproportional representationor the cumulative vote ineach Parliament by the whole body of Peers,  to sit and vote in the House;(b) 150 persons  to be nominated bythe Crown in proportion tothe parties in the House ofCommons in each Parliament,to sit for the life of the parliament;(c) The Crown to have the powerto appoint a limited numberof life Peers in each Parliament.In his memorandum Lord Salisbury suggestedthat the Cabinet should give the ministers in the House of Lords authority to acceptPart 1, whilst securing the elimination
There was general agreement that part 2 of the resolution was not acceptable and that the Government mustnot be committed at the present stage to this or to any other particularscheme for the application of theprinciples contained in part 1.A suggestion was made, and met withsome support,  that the question of Houseof Lords Reform could not be dealtwith unless there were such a measureof general concurrence between thedifferent parties as would give areasonable prospect of an agreed settlement.The Cabinet recognised, however,that in view of his previous attitudethe Lord Privy Seal could not be expectedto make an announcement of this kind.As an objection to part 1  of LordClarendon&apos;s Motion,  it was pointed outthat the limitation of the nunber ofmembers of the House of Lords contemplatedtherein would itself destroy the royal prerogative in regard to the making of peers, which was unacceptable to many members of Parliament.After considerable discussion, theLord Chancellor suggested the followingformula as preferable to part 1, viza
&quot;That it is desirable that early steps should be taken soto alter the constitution ofthe House as to ensure to eachpolitical party a fair positionin the House&quot;.The Minister of Health suggestedthat the last two .and a half lines ofpart 1  should be &quot;altered to read asfollows:-&quot;as would ensure to eachpolitical party the opportunityof obtaJLrung a fair positionin the House&quot;.The Lord Privy Seal undertook to consider these suggestions andto report to the Cabinet at their meeting on Friday, December 7th.
8.    The Cabinet had before them amemorandum by the Minister of Transport(CP. 370 (28)),  reporting that theRailway Companies are considering thequestion of applying for Parliamentarypowers to operate aerial transport services,and suggesting that he should beauthorised to inform the Railway Companies:-(l)  That the Government as atpresent advised sees no reasonto take exception to their proposals in(2) But that, as the companies will realise, any powers which Parliament may grantthem might have to be reviewed after the RoyalCommission on Transport has reported.The Cabinet approved the above proposals.
REDUCTION and limitation of armaments.PrivateManufactureof Arms.(previous reference:Cabinet VI(28), Con-clusion 7) *9.      The Cabinet had before them a memorandumby the Lord Privy Seal in regard to theinstructions to the British delegate atGeneva on the Private Manufacture ofArms, Ammunition and Implements of War,(Paper No. CP.  ^QO (28)).      In this memorandum it was pointed out that the Committee must decide this week upon a draft report dealingwith the supervision and publicity of private manufacture,  including a veto v/here the weapons are unlawful by international law.After a Sub-Committee of the Committeeof Imperial Defence had considered areport, and had settled the instructionsto our representatives in the belief thatno private manufacture of instruments ofwar were affected, which is 11 on theorder and behalf of the State)1, it wasdiscovered that though this saving clausecertainly covers all instruments of warpermitted by international law,  there isconsiderable doubt whether it also coversthose.,  the use of which is forbidden by international law..      Thereupon it was represented to the Sub-Committee       theAdmiralty and the War Office that they require a supply of poison gas - anunlawful instrument - not only for experimentalpurposes but also for stock, with a viewto possible retaliation, and that this cannot reasonably be provided by the Government
arsenals, and must therefore be obtainedfrom private manufacture.If the draft report were allowed to stand, our Service Departments would haveeither to abandon their practice as topoison gas, or we could not sign thereport In good faith.In the course of the discussion theCabinet were reminded that the attitude ofthe Service Departments Is based on theCabinet decision taken on 18th February,1925,   (Cabinet 9 (25) Conclusion 4),approving recommendations of the Committeeof Imperial Defence and authorising the insert!&apos;of a paragraph In the Field ServiceRegulations, and such other training manualsas might appear desirable, on the linesof a corresponding formula in the FrenchField Service Regulations.     According tothis formula the Government would endeavourat the beginning of a war and In agreementwith its Allies to obtain from the enemyGovernment an engagement not to use offensivegas as a weapon of war, and if this engagementwas not obtained, they would reserve theirliberty to act according to the circumstances.The Cabinet agreed -(a) That there should be no difficultyat the appropriate moment injustifying our position In regardto poison gas.     Certain nationswere known to have made preparations for the employment of poison gas, .and so long as this was the case,and the prohibition was not
universally accepted,  everynation had to he prepared toguard itself against this danger which necessitated the main enanceof stocks of poison gas.(b) That the present moment was nota convenient one at which toraise this issue.(c) That for the moment the british delegates at Geneva should he authorised to state that the wording of the present draft isun3dtiefactorvand that the Government must reserve their right to considerit carefully and to suggestalterations when the reportcomes before the Assembly.

The Cabinet had before them a memorandumby the Secretary of State for Air (paper No.CP. 363 (28)),  explaining,  for purposes ofrecord,  the circumstances in v/hich,  inconsultation with the Acting Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs, he agreed thatour representatives at the recent meetingof the League of Nations should depart inone respect from the recommendations ofthe Committee in regard to the DraftConvention relating to the Manufacture ofArms, Ammunition and Implements of War,contained in CP. 253 (28), and subsequentlyendorsed by the Cabinet on the 25thJuly,  (Cabinet if   (28)  Conclusion j) mThe memorandum explained the circum-stances in which an announcement had beenmade at the Third Committee of the Assemblyof the League of Nations at Geneva thatwe were prepared to withdraw our objectionto the inclusion of Category IV, viz.aircraft and aircraft engines.The Cabinet took note of the memorandumreferred to above.

The Cabinet had &quot;before them theConclusions of the Committee of HomeAffairs on the subject of the Age:of marriage Bill, which had been raisedbefore that Committee in a memorandumby the Koine Secretary (Paper No. H.A. 2 if(23)).
