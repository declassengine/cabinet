In viewof the fact that the reply )0f the Italian Governmenthad now been received it seemed an opportune moment to aiive all the documents to the public.
After a full discussion tfh-erOaWjiet agreed(a) That the British reply to the UnitedStates Note of September 28th, 1928,should not be sent until after the presidential Election:(b) That the Draft Circular Despatchshould be amended so as to dealsolely with past history and should refer in the closing paragraph tothe intention of His Majesty&apos;aGenremment to reply in due course to the American Note and the comnru-nications of the other Governmentsconcerned:(c) That the Acting Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs should considerthe following suggestions for amend-ing the Draft Circular Despatch:-(i) Paragraph 2: Begin with thesecond sentence and remove the first sentence to theend of the paragraph:(ii) Make clear in the course ofthe Despatch how the UnitedStates were involved in thenegotiations notwithstanding the fact that America wasnot a member of the Leagueof Nations.(iii) Page 2. line 7 from the bottom:&quot;insert after &quot;Classes&quot;,  &quot;but these Glasses included vessels of all types .(iv) Page 5. line 9:    After &quot;Treaty&quot;insert &quot;and they met thedesire of the U.S.A.

(f) That the Admiralty Memorandum (paper cp.-291 (28)) should not &quot;be published,but that the First Lord should takethe opportunity in the Debate on the address to make public the explanationscontained in the Memorandum:(g) That the Foreign Office should take such steps as they thought desirableto inform the Press that, inasmuch asthe answers of all the Governmentsconcerned have now been received,a White Paper would shortly be issued.
LAWS-OP WARAND BELLIGERENTRIGHTS AT SEA.(previous reference:Cabinet 30(28), Con-clusion 18.)3. The Acting Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, in the course of the foregoing discussion,informed the Cabinet of a recent conversation with sir Esme Howard on the relations between theUnited States and this country.    The impressionleft upon him by the Ambassador was that a veryserious situation was likely to arise in the nearfuture.    Senator Borah had attached to the naval construction Bill a Resolution calling upon theAmerican Government to summon a Conference for thediscussion of Belligerent Rights at Sea,    this resolution,  if proceeded with in Congress, wouldbe carried and would go to the Senate, and an invitation would probably reach this country earlyin 1929.    Either acceptance or refusal might haveembarrassing consequences,The position was further complicated by the necessityof holding a meeting of the Preparatory commission at Geneva before the end of next March.    If. inthe meantime, no advance had been made with theUnited States, the Commission would have to adjournwith nothing achieved.   This failure, occurringshortly before the General Election, would be fullyexploited by the opponents of the Government.   he asked for no decision at the moment, but desired to impress upon the Cabinet the importance of the issues involved. .In the course, of the discussion the cabinet were reminded of the prolonged study of the problemof Belligerent Rights by a Cabinet Committee, andof the special interest taken in the question bySir Austen Chamberlain.    The view which had found
most support in the Committee was that everyeffort ought to &quot;be made not to abate the policyhitherto followed by this country, and that if and when the international discussion of thesubject became imminent His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould endeavour to arrange preliminary conversa-tions with the Government of the United States.It could now be pointed out, also, that the policyof the recent Kellogg Pact was not likely to befurthered by raising now the question of belligerent-ent Rights at Sea.The Cabinet agreed That the Foreign Office and admiralty should examine the extent to whichthe American Navy co-operated withthe British Navy during the great war in exercising the rights ofsearch and blockade, and should prepare for the Cabinet the bestcase possible in support of british naval practice, founded upon the participation of the American navy in the late War.
THE FRENCHDEBT AGREE-MENT.(previous reference:Cabinet 46(26) 7 Con-elusion 3.)4.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer (Paper C.P.-282(28)) covering a draft Note to be sent to theFrench Government on the subject of their failure to secure ratification of the French War DebtAgreement signed by M. Caillaux in July, 1926.M. Caillaux fell from office shortly aftersigning the Agreement, but the Chancellor of theExchequer had received an assurance from M.Poincarein August,  1926, that he would ash the Chamber to ratify the Agreement in the autumn of that year at the latest.    In July, 1928, representationshad been made to the French Government,  and their reply confirmed the assurances given by M.Poincare,but, in effect, took up the position that Frenchdebt payments were conditional upon her reparationreceipts, whereas it was an essential part of thesettlement that the Annuities were on the solecredit of France .Suggestions were of interfered for modifying someexpressions in the text of the Memorandum whichwere thought to be unnecessarily provocative,,The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained, however,that the Memorandum was only a 30*aft, which wouldin any ease be discussed with the Foreign Office.The Cabinet took note of theMemorandum on the French DebtAgreement (Paper CP.-282 (28)),and the Chancellor of the exchequer undertook to adjust the text withthe Foreign Office.
DOMINIONMINTSTBRS.definition of Functionsof.(previous reference:Cabinet 15(28), Con-clusion 3.)5.The Cabinet had before them the following documents on the subject of the Functions ofDominion Ministers:-Memoranda by the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs (Papers C.P.-285 (28) and CP.-294 ( 28)):A Memorandum by the Acting Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs (paper c.P.-290 (28)) .In Paper C.F0-285 (28) the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs stated that correspondencehad been proceeding vith the Canadian and IrishFree State Governments as to the appointment of a canadian Minister at Paris and the proposed appoint-ment of Irish Free State Ministers at Paris andBerlin, and that in this connection both dominions had raised the question of the phraseology to beemployed in the Notes to the French and german governments insofar as it related to the respectivefunctions of the Dominion Ministers and of HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassadors at the foreign Capitalsconcerned.   In the Notes addressed to the UnitedStates Government as regards the appointment of irish Free State and Canadian Ministers atWashington there was in each case a definitedistinction drawn between matters relating to theIrish Free State or Canada and &quot;matters which areof Imperial concern or which affect other Dominions&quot;,which latter wer^ to continue to be handled as here-tofore &quot;by the Embassy&quot;.   This definition was followed by a statement that the arrangements &quot;wouldnot denote any departure from the principle of the diplomatic unity of the Empire&quot;.   The canadian government had expressed their vievve in a telegram dated August 17th,  and suggested that a variation in the form used in notifying the United States
Government of the proposed establishment of theCanadian Legation in Washington would be desirable.The general view of the Irish Free State Governmentwas that, while ir favour of the closest co-opera-tion between the British Ambassador and the irish minister in all matters that might be deemed to beof common interest,  they felt that all matterswhatsoever that might affect the interests of theIrish Free State should be dealt with by the irish minister.    Mr Amery considered it to be of theutmost importance to retain the paragraph in the note which dealt with diplomatic unity, but thatit would be a mistake to try to lay down any hard and fast definition of what was &quot;Imperial1&apos; or&quot;common&quot;.   He therefore suggested the followingformula:-&quot;Such a Minister would be accredited byHis Majesty the King to the Presidentof the French Republic,  and he wouldbe furnished with credentials whichwould enable him to take charge ofall affairs relating to Canada.   Hewould be the ordinary channel ofcommunication with the French Govem-ment on these matters.    The arrange-ments proposed vrould not denote any departure from the principle of the diplomatic unity of the Empire.    TheCanadian Minister would at all timesbe in the closest touch with HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador,  and the best method of dealing with any questionwhich may arise which may concern moret han one of His Ma jes ty&apos;s Governroent sor the whole of the British Empirewould be settled by consxiltation&quot; .If the Cabinet approved this formula and it were accepted by Mr Mackensie King, Mr Amery proposedto take a similar line in discussing the matter with the Frse State Government.In Paper CP.-290 (28) the Acting Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs stated that thequestion raised by the Secretary of State for
Dominion Affairs was one of first importance inregard to the Constitutional structure of the BritishEmpire as a whole, and was therefore one that ought not to &quot;be hastily decided or without consultationwith the other Dominions and the Government of India.The present position in regard to the diplomatic representation of the British Empire abroad wasthat His Majesty fs Ambassador or Minister wascharged with the duty of representing to the foreign government to which he was accredited matters ofImperial concern or matters which concerned otherDominions.    So long as that position remained,  theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs was the solechannel by which the will of the several Governmentsof the Empire should be co-ordinated in the instruc-tions sent to His Majesty ?s representatives abroad in matters       Imperial concern.   Lord Gushendunsubmitted that the whole problem should be franklylaid before an Tmpei-ial Conference.    If, however,the wording of the Notes to the United StatesGovernment was to be abandoned, he suggested thefollowing formula as possibly more acceptable tothe Canadian and Irish Free State Governments,although it was recognised and intended that in substance it did not differ from the old one:-&quot;Such a Minister would be accredited byHis Majesty the King to the President ofthe French Republic and he would be furnished with credentials which wouldenable him to take charge of all affairsrelating to Canada.   He would be theordinary channel of communication withthe French Government on these matters.Matters which concern more than one ofHis Majesty&apos;s Governments or the wholeof the British Empire will continue tobe handled by His Majesty&apos;s Embassy as heretofore, as also matters of concernonly to Pis Majesty&apos;s Government inGreat Britain or a part of the empire which has not individual diplomatic
representation in Paris.     It is not intended that the arrangements proposed should derogate from the principle ofthe diplomatic unity of the Empire.The Canadian Minister would &quot;be at all times in the closest touch with HisMajesty ]s Ambassador, and any questionwhich may arise as to whether a mattercomes within the category of those tobe handled by the Canadian minister or not would be settled by consultation between them&quot; .,In Paper CP.-294 (28) the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs circulated a copy of a semi-official letter from the Department of external affairs of the Irish Free State on the same subject,together with a copy of the letter to which it wasa reply.The Secretary  of State for the Dominions andthe Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsrecapitulated the arguments set forth in theirrespective Memoranda, summarised above.The Prime Minister expressed the view thatin the absence of the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs it was undesirable to come to a conclusion on a matter of such importance.The Cabinet agreed  To adjourn the consideration of the memoranda by the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs and the acting Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs  (Papers CP .-285 (28), C.P.-294 (28) and CCP0-290  (28)) until thereturn of Sir Austen Chamberlain; and to request the Secretary of State for theDominions to inform the Canadian PrimeMinister and the Irish Free Stateaccordingly *
6. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Lord Chancellor (Paper C.P.-289 (28)) on thesubject of additional Judges for the SupremeTribunals.   In this Memorandum Lord Hailsharorecalled that the proposal to enlarge the JudicialCommittee of the Privy Council by the appointmentof two members of Indian experience had receivedthe approval of the Cabinet on three occasions.The proposal had been before Parliament- three times and had passed the House of Lords but had failed to become law through lack of time and through the opposition of a small minority in theHouse of Commons.    The Indian Assembly in 1926 had passed a resolution in favour of defraying from indian funds half the salary of each of the twobiembers to be appointed,  and it was especially important that the necessary legislation should been acted in the present Parliament without further delay.   The Lord Chancellor also asked authorityto introduce legislation increasing the number ofLords of Appeal in Ordinary by one, which would remove some of the present difficulties.   The costof the proposed additions to the Judicial Committeewould be  4,000 a year, an additional  4,000 being found by India,  and the cost of the proposal to addone Lord of Appeal in Ordinary would be  6,000 perannuir A.The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed toprovide the funds required for the salary of anadditional Lord of Appeal in Ordinary.
1AThe Cabinet agreed  (a) To authorise the Lord Chancellor tointroduce legislation increasing thenumber of Lords cf Appeal in Ordinaryby one t(b) To request the Parliamentary Secretaryto the Treasury to make every effort to pass through the House of commons the legislation.necessary for theenlargement of the Judicial Committeeof the Privy Council and the appoint-in ent of an additional Lord of Appealin Ordinary, on the lines indicated by the Lord Chancellor in his memorandum to the Cabinet (Paper C.P.-289 (28)).
THE NORTHERN&quot;IRELAND UN-EMPLOYMENTINSURANCEAGREEMENT,(previous refer ere e?Cabinet 4(26), Con-clusion 3.)fit.7 . The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer (Paper C.F.-237 (28))covering a Draft Agreement with Northern ireland on the subject of Unemployment InsuranceB   In thisMemorandum Mr Churchill recalled that on February 10,1926, an Agreement was made between the british treasury and the Government of Northern Ireland tokeep the Northern Ireland Unemployment Fund inparity with the British Unemployment Fund by meansof special payments from the Treasuries of GreatBritain and Northern Ireland, of which approximately two-thirds were contributed by the British Treasury.Owing to the dependence of Northern Ireland onShipbuilding and the Linen Trade, unemployment wasrelatively higher than in Great Britain, and thiswas likely to continue, although the position atthe present time was much better than it was in1925-26..    The Government of Ireland have now asked that the Agreement, which was due to expire onMarch 15,  1930, might be made permanent during thenext Session, in return for which they were willingto undertake to repay, on March 31, 1929,  424,000of the pre-1925 debt of the Northern IrelandUnemployment Fund and to pay off the balance of 3,000,000 in yearly instalments of  100,000.The effect of settling the question now would be to save  14,000 in 19 29,   The draft Agreement wouldrequire confirmation by a one-Clause Act of Parlia-ment, both here and in Belfast, and our legislationmust be passed by about March 1, 1929, in order to--enable the Northern Ireland Parliament to confirm the Agreement in time for the payment due thereunderon March 31, 1929, to be made.    The cost to the
British Treasury of renewing the Agreement under existing conditions would be about  300,000 to 400,000 a year, diminishing gradually as theinterest on the pre-1925 debt decreased with the repayment o^ the debt.The Cabinet agreed in principle to the policy set forth in theMemorandum by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (Paper CP.-2.87(28)) for &quot;dealing with theNorthern Ireland UnemploymentInsurance Agreement, and recore-men ded that, subject to Parlia-mentary exigencies, it shouldbe given statutory effect duringthe coming Session of Parliament.
THE ATTITUDE 8. The Cabinet took note of a Memorandum by theOP INDIANOLITICIANS. Secretary of State for India (Paper 0.P.-288 (28))containing an extract from a recent private letter(dated September 6, 1928) which he had receivedfrom the Viceroy regarding the trend towards the left of All-India politicians.2, Whitehall Gardens, S,W*1,October 10, 1928.
