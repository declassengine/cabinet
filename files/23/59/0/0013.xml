NAVAL CON-STRUCTTONPROGRAMME.Announced en tregarding the cruiser Type.(previous reference e:Cabinet 57(28), Con-elusion 9 ,)1. The Cabinet resumed the discussion begunthe same morning on the subject of the naval construction Programme.In the course of the discussion it was urgedthat if tenders were sent out at once a goldenopportunity might be lost for responding to any action which might be taken by the Senate or thePresident of the United States of America in thedirection of reducing the risk of an Anglo-American competition in naval armaments.    Theview was strongly pressed, and supported, thatthe Cabinet should reserve their discretion totake advantage of any opportunity that might offer for Braking some response, though there was generalagreement that in the absence of some suchopportunity the programme should be proceeded with.The First Lord of the Admiralty made clearthat if the sending out of tenders was postponed,the actual orders could not be placed within thepresent financial year.After some considerable further discussion the Cabinet agreed  (a) That the programme already approvedby the Cabinet, and announc-ed, forthe construction of two Class &quot;A&quot;Cruisers of 10,000 tons, with8-inch guns, to be laid down in thefinancial year 1928-29,  should stand, but tenders in connection therewith should not be sent outuntil aftor the Meeting of theCabinet immediately before Parlia-ment meets again, and subject tothe following:-(b) That members of the Cabinet shouldbe entitled to reopen the questionof the construction of the Cruisersat the Meeting or the Cabinet referredto, in the event of some new factoraffecting the situation arising outof events in America in connectionwith the passage of their CruiserBill:    but that in the absence-1-
of some such new factor thequestion should not be raised.The First Lord of the Admiraltyconsented to this decision in response to the strong appeal ofthe Prime ICLnistier, on behalf ofhis colleagues, but asked to placeon record his vinw that anyreadjustment of our carefully considered programme to meet thedecisions of the American Govern-ment would connote the idea ofa naval competition with the UnitedStates and would therefore involvea departure from what is at presenta very safe position.
2.The Cabinet had before them the following documents in regard to the Estimates of theFighting Services:-An Extract from the Minutes ofthe 238th Meeting of the Committeeof Imperial Defence, together withthe Report under consideration atthat Meeting (Paper C.P.-348 (28)),at which the Chancellor of theExchequer had asked that the total sum for the Estimates for all three Services for 1929-30 shouldnot exceed  110,000,000, which involved a reduction of  4,500,000on the present Estimates:A Memorandum by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (Paper C.P.-376  (.28))expanding his statement at theMeeting of the Committee of ImperialDefence referred to above, and asking the Cabinet, on urgent grounds of policy as well as of financialnecessity, to request the defence ministers to. arrange in consultationthat the total o^ the FightingServices&apos; Estimates for 1929 shallnot exceed  110,000,000,   of which,as a rough guide,  2,7 50,000 should fall on the&quot;Navy Estimates,  1,000,000on Army, and  750,000 on Air Estimates:A Memorandum by the First Lord ofthe Admiralty (Paper C.F.-384 (28))containing reasons for the contention that a reduction of  2,750,000 asasked for by the Chancellor of theExchequer is beyond the bounds of possibility, while expressing thehope of achieving a reduction of something like  1,000,000.The Chancellor of the Exchequer gave the cabinet an account of the difficulties of the financial situation and asked them to enjoin ^lpon theMinisters at the head of the three service departments, individually and collectively, toreduce their Estimates to a total of  110,000^000.The First Lord of the Admiralty stated that&quot;, he was doing his utmost, and hoped to achieve a.   total economy of  1,000,000,  but he could not seehis way beyond that.The Secretary of State for Air explained hisgSTlMATES OF%E FIGHTINGSERVICE S .(previou reference:Cabinet 55(28), Con-conclusion 3 .)
own difficulties, and produced some remarkablefigures regarding the extent to which foreign nations are expanding their Air Forces(The S&quot;cr^tary o^ State for Warwasti a be ent during this part ofthe Cabinet discus si on.)The Cabinet, in inviting the attention of theService Ministers to  the Chancellor of theExchequerfs appeal, asked the Secretary of Statefor Air to prepare a Memorandum regarding thefigures he had quoted, and requested him in doing so, if possible,  to obtain the agreement of theother Services to that part of his figures whichconcerned them.    Sir Samuel Hoare was asked alsoto include figures for Civil Aviation.    He was further asked to bear in rcind the desirability ofthe publication of these figures in Parliament atthe appropriate moment.
CfflNA. 3. The Cabinet had before, them the following the Boxer Memoranda in regard to the China Boxer IndemnityIndemnity..A Mote by the Acting Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs(Previous (Lord Cushendun)  (Paper C.P.-Reference: 343 (28)) covering a MemorandumCabinet 20 by the Far Eastern Department of(88), Con- the Foreign Office containing aelusion 9.) suggestion that all futureinstalments of the Boxer Indemnityshould be released unconditionallyto the Chinese Government;together with telegraphic corres-pondence with His Majesty&apos;minister at Peking, and a minute of a conversation with Lord Buxton:A memorandum by the Secretary ofState for the Colonies (paper cp.-359 (28)) urging that  thesum. necessary for the further development of the Hong-KongUniversity should be providedout of the accumulated instal-ments of the Boxer Indemnity nowin our hands:A Memorandum by the   Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (Paper CP.-377 (28))pointing out that His tiajesty&apos;sGovernment have been frequentlyattacked on the ground that they are too readily disposed to abandon theclaims of this country on foreign nations,  and asking the Cabinet to reject the proposal of the ForeignOffice:    and urging instead that sir Miles Lampson should be instructed to negotiate an agreementwith the Chinese Government by whichHis Majesty&apos;s Government shouldsurrender all future instalments ofthe Indemnity on condition that,firstly,  the existing fund is paidto the British Exchequer on accountof the expenditure incurred overShanJhai;    and, secondly, that satisfactory arrangements are reachedabout the Commercial Treaty and thesettlement of private British claims:A Note by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs (Paper CP.-411 (28))opposing  the Chancellor of theExchequer&apos;s proposal on the groundthat it would be contrary to thepromises which we have made and repeated to China and the whole world that the whole of the funds are to be remitted for the mutualinterests of China and Great britain for &quot;educational and other&quot; purposes and not applied to purely Britishpurposes, and that it would be contrary to the present generalpolicy of encouragement and friend-line ss to the new China:
2v rA Note by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs (Paper C.P.-412 (28))  covering telegraphic correspondence with His Majesty&apos;minister in Peking, who statedthat the Nanking Goverror&apos;ent wouldbe only too ready to agree to any terms within reason we might attach to unconditional surrender, and suggested that the best thing towork for would be a voluntarydeclaration by the Chinese oftheir intention to apply the recom-mendation of the Advisory Committeein its entirety, plus an undertaking to place such orders as might arisethereunder in regard to railway construction, conservancy work, etc.,in Great Britain.    Sir Miles Lampsonalso in this correspondence expressedthe conviction that the effect ofdevoting the accumulated depositsto the assistanc e of Kong-KongUniversity would be bad.In the course of the discussion emphasis was laid on the importance of Sir Miles Lamps on&apos;proposal that the test thing to work for would bea voluntary declaration by the Chinese of their intention, inter alia, to give an undertaking toplace such orders as might arise, in regard to railway construction,  conservancy work, etc., inGreat Britain.    The attention of the cabinet was also called to the fact that Belgium, holland and Italy had surrendered their balance on condition of its being used on constructive works of public utility,.The Cabinet were also reminded of a recent-telegram in which it was stated that a Minister ofthe Nationalist Government had laid some emphasis on the importance of re-conditioning the railways.The Chancellor of the exchequer having con-sent ed, in deference to the views of his colleagues,to resign the Treasury claims, -The Cabinet approved the proposalsof the Secretary of State for Foreigny Affairs, who undertook to do his utmost to try and secure the
expenditure of as much of the funds as possible on railway construction,  etc., and to obtainthe allocation of some part of itto Bong-Kong Univers ity, though he could not hold out much hopeof securing a large sum for thispurpose.Sir Austen Ghairberlain asked thePresident of the Board of Tradeto let hir have a short Memorandumregarding the sort of works he contemplated.While the proposal of the   Secretaryof State for the Colonies was understood to apply only to  the accumulated funds, Sir austen chamberlain hoped that theexpenditure on constructive workmight perhaps be applied both tothe accumulated funds and to theannual amounts surrendered.-7-
? c; the indian statutory commission .SuggestedInvitationto IndianCentral Com-ir.itt.ee to visit Englandnext Summer.(previous reference e:Cabinet 39(28), Con-elusion 14 0)4m The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Secretary of State ^or India (Paper C.P.-402 (28)) covering correspondence with Sir john simon and the Viceroy of India, in which theformer strongly urged that he should be author-ised to invite the members of the Indian central committee, which is co-operating with theStatutory Commission in its present Inquiry inIndia,  to come to England at a convenient timenext year.    In his Memorandum Lord Peel proposedto reply that Sir John Simon might make anannouncement to the members of the Committee tothis effect, but stipulating that he should makeit clear privately to the members that the dateof their visit must depend upon the date of theGeneral Election here:    that the final invitationwould be for them to arrive in England at a timewhen the members of the Statutory Commission are about to resume their sittings;    that Sir Johnshould endeavour to induce the Indian central committee to write its Report here, and, ifpossible, to agree to present its Report beforethe Statutory Commission^ Report is drafted;that the Committee should be warned that theywill be afforded no opportunity to take any partin framing the Statutory Commission&apos;s Report;  and indicating that His Majesty&apos;s Government are opposed to any attempt to recruit assistance fromany members of the Indian Opposition even if theprospect of an invitation to England might induce them to desert from their present position.

5. The Cabinet resumed their discussion on theAmerican proposal for the erection of a Memorialto the United States Wavy at Gibraltar.   Inaddition to the Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs which had been beforethem at their previous Meeting, they had underconsideration a Memorandum by the Secretary ofS+ate for the Colonies  (paper C.P.-404 (28))&apos;covering copies of correspondence with the Governor of Gibraltar as well as with theService Departments.    From this correspondence it transpired, inter alia, that the Governor of gibraltar had already informed the American BattleMonuments Commission that every possible facilitywould be granted by the Government of Gibraltar,who gratefully accepted the suggestion for amonument .In connection with the discussion on thisproposal the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs mentioned to his colleagues a conversation he had had with Admiral Pratt, Commanding the United states naval Forces on the Pacific Coast.    In the courseof this conversation they had discussed the co-operation of the British and American Fleets inthe Great War, and the idea of some meeting betweenthe Fleets where contact could again be resumedwas mentioned.

to reply to the Americanrequest that His Ma.jesty&apos;sGovernment gladly consent tothe proposal for the erection of a monument at Gibraltar,and should invite them to settle the form and situation of themonument with the Governor ofGibral tar.It was left to the Secretaryof State for the Colonies, ifhe so desired, to make a communication to the Governorregarding the form of themonument.
THE ELECTRICITY 6. The Cabinet had before their, a Report ofBOARD. (Paper C.P.-392  (28))the Electricity Board Committee^giving full(Previous information as to the work of the ElectricityReference:Cabinet 52 Board and advising that satisfactory progress has(28),  Con-clusion 2.) been made by the Electricity Commissioners and theCentral Electricity Board in implementing theprovisions or the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1926 .The Cabinet Committee further expressed theirconviction that the Commissioners and the board are doing everything in their power to expedite the scheme and that it. would be unreasonable to expect that the scheme could be still furtherexpedited^s^ornext Summer by the adoption of measures other than those now contemplated bythe Commissioners and the Board.The President of the Board of Trade asked anyof his colleagues who might refer in public speechesto the work of the Electricity Board to be carefulabout the Gas industry, which had certain legitimategrievances .The Prime Minister expressed the view that thecase of the Gas industry would have to be taken up in the next Parliament.The Cabinet approved the Reportof the Electricity Board Committee(Paper C.P.-392 (38)).
7 Ps 9&amp; 0INTER-imperial relations.High commissioners-sioners of theDominions .The Union ofSouth Africa.(Pr eviousRefer ens e:Cabinet 54(28), Con-clusion 6.)7. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Secretary o^ State for Dominion Affairs(Paper C.P.-387 (28)) in regard to the positionof the High Commissioner of the Union of SouthAfrica in London.    In his Memorandum theSecretary of State expressed the view that hewould much prefer if General Hertsog could be induced to retain the title &quot;High Commissioner&quot;,but if some -o^rhea? title were insisted on he expressed preference for the term &quot;political representative&quot;,  or, if this should proveunacceptable, &quot;Plenary Representative&quot;.   In anycase he was anxiou3 to avoid any phrasepossessing implications such as that of&quot;Diplomatic Representative&quot;.   In any officialreply to General Hertzog he proposed to emphasizethat the High Commissioner already enjoys a very high status,  and that in particular -(i) as regards direct access to ministers and authority todiscuss and deal with anysubject, we are only too glad to accord to the High Commis-sioner whatever position hisown Government may wish him to occupy:(ii) as regards exemption from taxation and similar matters. DominionHigh Commissioners have alreadybeen placed on the same footing as foreign Ambassadors and ministers:    and(iii) as regards precedence,  it is notpossible, for reasons which are known to General Hertzog, to placeHigh Commissioners on exactly thesame footing as foreign Ambassadorsor Ministers, but they are already given, on ceremonial occasions, thehighest precedence possible without involving their ranking, by virtueof their office, before ministers of Great Britain or of a Dominionwho may be present on the sameoccasion&quot; .-IS-
After a short discussion the Cabinet agreedThat the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs, through the channelhe deemed appropriate,  shouldemphasize to General Wertzog thefact that th? term &quot;High Commissioner&apos;satisfies Canada and ail the otherDominions, as well as India, andshould endeavour to induce himto adhere to this title.   It wassuggested that Mr Amery should drawGeneral Hertzog&apos;s attention to thefact that the term &quot;High Commis-sioner&quot; is the highest title usedin inter-Imperial relations, notonly by the Dominions but also bythe Home Government&apos;s adoption ofthat title for their representative in Canada.    He might also point outthat in international affairs the term is regarded as one of thehighest authority:    for example,in the Anglo-Egyptian negotiationsSarwat Pasha had asked that theBritish High Commissioners statusin Egypt might be reduced to thatof an Ambassador   showing theimportance which he attached to it;and in the Great War also the term&quot;High Commissioner&quot; was the highesttitle that had been conferred on british representatives abroad.

This view was generally accepted.The Cabinet agreed -To approve in principle theproposals of the Presidentof the Board of Trade, on theunderstanding that details shouldbe arranged between the Treasury,the Board of Trade and theDepartment of Overseas Trade,  theexpenditure being met, as far as-possible, from compensatingeconomies elsewhere .

Unfortunately it had been shot down .A message had been received from the pilots to theeffect that they were safe, but they were understood to be detained, probably by the rebels.    So far the British Minister and other persons within theLegation precincts were reported to be safe, andit was understood that the tribesmen had no disposi-tion to attack the Legation.   The situation, however,was one of considerable anxiety, and it was difficultto render any assistance.   The Air Officer Command-ing in India, however, was doing his best to assistor extricate the British colony.   At present theLegation had only a receiving wireless apparatusas the Afghan Government had not consented to the installation of a transmitting set.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs pointed out that the political  situation was oneof considerable danger.   The Afghan rebels were particularly incensed against the Russians in afghanistan, and therefore there was a risk thatthey might create a situation in which SovietRussia might have an excuse for Intervening.Although the British Minister corresponded withthe Foreign 0&apos;office it had always been recognised by Lord Peel and his predecessor that the India
office was the Department primarily concerned,and the Foreign Office to a great extent actedae a post office in Afghan matters.
