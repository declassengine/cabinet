THE persian gulf.(previous reference:r Cabinet 34-(28), Con-elusion 2.)1 .The Cabinet bad be-fore- -them-an -XnterimReport (Paper cp.-321 (28)) of a Sub-Committee-of the Committee of Imperial Defence appointed on june 25,  1928, by the Prime Minister at therequest of the Cabinet, to examine our policy inthe Persian Gulf in the light of the presentposition.   In a covering Note the Secretary statedthat, in view of the urgency due to Sir RobertOlive&apos;s departure for Teheran, it had been necessary to place the Report before the Cabinetwithout first passing it through the Committee ofImperial Defence.The Cabinet also had before them a Note bythe Secretary of State for the Colonies (paper c.P.-522 (28)) expressing the hope that theCabinet would give a general ruling that Sir RobertClive should enter upon his negotiations atTeheran with the knowledge that we shall in no case submit our position in the Persian Gulf,whether in regard to Bahrein or to any otherpoint at issue, to the League of Nations, andthat we may possibly in the near future have to announce definitely in connection with the KelloggPact that we regard the Persian Gulf as an area where interference with our supremacy or withour established rights will be resisted as adirect act of aggression against ourselves.The Chancellor of the Exchequer demurredto the principle of buying good will in negotia-tions of this kind by the remission of debtB, butit was pointed out that if the general settlement as contemplated by the Subcommittee was achievedwe should buy much more than good will, namely,a title to and recognition of our position in the
Persian Gulf.   Mr Churchill, while reluctantlyconceding that it might be worth while to give up the Debt in order to secure a general settle-ment, dwelt on the grave political and Parlia-mentary inconvenience which would arise if thewai-^ing of the Persian Debt, as proposed by theSub-Committee, should coincide in point of time with the concessions in regard to the arrearsdue to us under the policy of the Balfour Note,which, as he had not concealed from the Cabinet,might have to be made in connection with the reparations settlement.   Prom this point of view he urged strongly that the negotiations should,if possible, be postponed for a time.Postponement of the negotiations with Persiawas also urged from the point of view of Mr Amery&apos;sproposals in Paper C.P.-322 (28)   .   The questionof principle as to whether we could withholdPersian Gulf questions from the League of nations was one which the Cabinet realised required further exploration, and in any event could not be decided in the absence of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs.   It was pointed out, however, that sir Robert Clive would, from the very first, approachhis negotiations from a different point of viewif he knew that the Government would refuse theapplication of League of Nations procedure to thePersian Gulf, and this was urged as a further argument for postponement.On the other hand, the  Cabinet were reminded that a specific undertaking had been given that wewould take up the Persian negotiations in the Autumn,and that the Pei-russians had been pressing for the
Ministers early return.   In these circumstances it was felt that Sir Robert Olive would be placedin an impossible position if he had to ask for afurther delay pending final instructions whichawaited Sir Austen Chamberlain&apos;s return.   Moreover,-If there were any further delay in opening negutia-tions there was little doubt that the PersianGovernment would insist that their claim to Bahreinshould be considered at the next meeting of theLeague of Nations Council.In these circumstances it was suggested thatthe best plan would be to allow Sir Robert Clive,on his arrival at Tehran, to begin negotiations-slowly and tentatively on some of the numerouspoints in controversy, but to avoid expressing any opinion on the question of the Persian Debt until he should receive further instructions.In the course of the discussion it wassuggested that when the Note by the Secretary ofState for the Colonies  (Paper C.P.-322 (28)) was discussed at the Cabinet after Sir Austen Chamber-lain&apos; s return, the Lord Chancellor should be askedto express an opinion as to whether the persian gulf could be reserved from the League of Nationsunder the provisions of Article 21 of the Covenantwithout breach of our obligations .The question was raised as to whether sir robert Clive could not, in the course of the nego-tiations&apos;, take up the case of the Sheikh ofMohammerah, who, though in Treaty relations withthe Persian Government, had been ill-treated andcompelled tcr remain in Tehran by the present regime;but *at the request of the Acting Secretary of State-g-
for Foreign Affairs the proposal was not pressed the Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve generally the InterimReport (Paper CP.-321 (28)) ofLord HailshamTs Sub-Committee ofthe Committee of Imperial Defence,the Summary of Conclusions of whichis reproduced in Appendix I to these minutes:BUT SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING:-(b) That Sir Robert Clive, the british minister at Tehran, should beauthorised to proceed slowly andtentatively with the negotiations on the lines of the Sub-Committee&apos;sReport, but should avoid expressingany opinion or committing himself in any way in regard to the proposalsof the Sub-Committee for the remission of the Persian War Debt (Summary of conclusions    in Appendix I, Para.(k)and Para (l)(xii)(5):(c) That the question of the remission of the debt incurred during the War,together with the question of whetherthe Persian Gulf could be withheld from the League of Nations, Shouldbe discussed by the Cabinet as soonas possible after Sir austen chamberlain&apos;s return:(d) That the general approval of the interim Report o*&quot; the Sub-Committeeshould not be deemed to commit theTreasury to particular expenditureon the development of a strategicair route along the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf involving theprovision of aerodromes and possiblysubsidies to the Sheikhs, but shouldbe subject to the usual discussionof Estimates between the Air ministry or other Departments concerned and theTreasury .The Cabinet further agreed  (e) That the Sub-Committee should remainin being and continue its investiga-tions .
rf7NEMPLOYMENTThe Transfer-ence Policy.(previous reference:Cabinet 39(28), Con-clusion 2.)2.  The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Minister of Labour giving the facts asregards the progress made up to date with thepolicy adopted on the recommendation of theIndustrial Transference Board (Paper CP.-324 (28))The Cabinet, while fully recognising the gravity of the Unemployment situation, took note of the satisfactory progress made in the matterof transference.
THE UNEMPLOY- 3. The Cabinet had before them a MemorandumMENT insurance bill. by the Minister of Labour (Paper CP.-331 (88))covering a draft of an Unemployment Insurance Bill(previous reference: prepared in accordance with the decision of theCabinet 48(28), Con-        Cabinet referred to in the margin.   In his coveringelusion 6.)Note the Minister of Labour explained that thedraft had been agreed with the Treasury, and suggested that, in view of the urgent need of introducing the Bill early, perhaps it might be unnecessary to refer it to the Committee of HomeAffairs .In addition, shortly before the Cabinet Meetingthe Minister of Labour circulated a Memorandum inregard to the provision in the Unemployment InsuranceAct, passed in 1927, by which unemployed personsshall not be entitled to receive benefit under theInsurance Scheme unless they have paid 30 contribu-tions during the preceding two years (Paper C.P.-333 (28)).   Statements in the Press within the last three days had led Sir Arthur Steel-Maitland tothink that he ought to bring the matter to the noticeof his colleagues, since it may become urgent at any moment by reason of representations being made thatprompt Government action is necessary to preventlarge numbers of people from losing UnemploymentBenefit.   In his Memorandum the Minister of Labourexpressed the view that any modification of the 30contributions rule would be a disaster, but indicated that it might be necessary.to take special measures in a comparatively few areas where there are consid-erable numbers of people who will not satisfy the-rule.
The Cabinet concurred in the general vie?of the Minister of Labour that it would be a gravemistake at the present time to make any alteration in the policy of the 30 contributions, but thatthe situation would require to be carefully watched;    and agreed  That the Minister       Labour shouldhave authority to introduce theUnemployment Insurance bill attached to Paper C.P.-331 (28),without reference to the Committeeof Home Affairs .
ONFMPLOYMEKT(Previouslafc Reference:F Cabinet 45(28), Con-clusion 6 .)4.The Cabinet bad before them the Report of an inter-Departmental Committee, under the chairmanship of Sir Warren Fisher, containing recommendations for dealing with Unemployment (Paper C.P.-325 (28)).It was pointed out that the present proposalsdiffered from previous schemes for alleviation ofunemployment in one important essential, namely,that the Report under consideration contemplated the attraction of labour from the distresseddistricts to areas of better employment where theworkers would have opportunities of obtainingpermanent employment.On the other hand, attention was drawn tothe great cost of the various proposals in compari-son with the numbers to whom temporary employment would be given, and to the small impression whichwould be made on the aggregate figures for unemploy-ment in the country.   It was suggested that moremight be hoped from measures to improve trade, suchas the Rating Reform Scheme, and Migration.The Cabinet agreed -That a Cabinet Committee, composed as follows:-The Chancellor of the Exchequer(in the Chair),The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs and the Colonies,The Secretary of State for War,The Secretary of State for Scotland,The President of the Board of Trade,The Minister of Health,The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries,The President of the Board of Education,The Minister of Labour -should meet on the following day at11 a,m. to consider the proposals in paper C.P.-325 (28) and to report tothe Cabinet on the following Wednesdaytheir recommendations as to whatannouncement should be made in theforthcoming Parliamentary debates on the subject of Unemployment.
THE ROSYTH NAVALDOCKYARD.(Pr ev iou reference:Cabinet 21(28).  Con-conclusion 7.)5. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe First Lord of the Admiralty (Paper C.P.-316(28)) recalling that when it wa3 decided threeyears ago to place Rosyth Naval Dockyard on acare-and-rraint maintenance basis, the Cabinet made the proviso that it was to be kept fully efficient and ready to open at short notice, which had hitherto been interpreted by the Admiralty as necessitatingthe retention of all plant,  etc., so that the Yardcould be reopened at one month&apos;s notice.   In his memorandum Mr Bridgeman stated that, in view ofthe recent adoption, as the basis of Navy Estimates,of a ten years&apos; Interval without a major war, themaintenance of Rosyth at so short a notice as one month would seem superfluous, and that the Admiraltyproposed to interpret the period of notice asextending to a maximum of 12 months.   This wouldenable economies to be effected by transferringpart of the plant to other Yards, but would stillenable the Yard to be reopened at short noticeat reduced output.The Cabinet approved the proposalsof the First Lord of the admiralty in Paper C.P.-316 (28).
THS FUTURE OFS^EFRNESSDOCKYARD.(previous previous reference:Cabinet 52(35), Ccn-clusion 11.)6. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the First Lord of the Admiralty (Paper C.P.-319 (28)) stating that the Board of Admiralty had reached the conclusion that Sheerness Dockyard isno longer required *or Naval,purposes and that itsred\iction to a care-and-^ maintenance maintenance status wouldeffect considerable economies in Navy Estimates,of which the Memorandum contained full particularsMr BridgemanBefore taking any step in the matter, however, /had felt it necessary to submit the position to aCabinet decision, in view of the consequences itwould have in creating a new distressed area and increasing unemployment.   For the latter reason the Cabinet felt it would be premature to carryout the proposals of the Board of Admiralty atthe present time, although the possibility shouldbe kept in view of disposing of the Dockyard for commercial purposes if an opportunity should occur
7 . The Cabinet had before them the following documents in regard to the Title of His majesty&apos;s government t-A Memorandum by the Home Secretary(Paper C.P.-308 (28)) recallingthat on the 4th May last theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs had informed the Cabinetthat he had received representations from Northern Ireland objecting tothe use of the term &quot;His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in Great Britain&quot; as the title of His Majesty&apos;s Government.The matter had since been thesubject of Departmental considera-tion, and the Hone Secretary urged the adoption of the term &quot;HisMajesty*s Government in the UnitedKingdom&quot;, which, in cases where theuse of the term &quot;United Kingdom&quot;might involve ambiguity, would be expanded to &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United Kingdom of Great Britainand Northern Ireland&quot;.A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs (paper cp.-315 (28)) giving a number of reasons for adhering to the presenttitle as &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin Great Britain&quot;, which had beenapproved by the Cabinet and wasextensively employed in the Reportof the Imperial Conference, 1926.A Memorandum by the Chancellor ofthe Duchy o^ Lancaster (Paper CP.-318 (23)) strongly supporting theview of the ?Tome Secretary, mainlyfromi the point of view of NorthernIreland.In the course of a short discussion theproposal of the Home Secretary was supported on theground that an Act of Parliament had been passeddescribing it as &quot;The Parliament of the UnitedKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland&quot;.On the other hand, it was pointed out that theinternational description of some of the DominionGovernments did not correspond with the titles oftheir Parliaments.THE TITL&apos;&quot;&apos; OFHIS MAJESTY&apos;SGOVERNMENT .(previous reference e:Cabinet 27(28), Con-clusibn 7 .)
The Cabinet agreed  That the question should be postponed until the return ofthe Secretary of State ^or foreign Affairs.55By instructions of the Prime Minister,after consultation with one or two ofhis colleagues, the Conclusion has beenworded as above in preference to theoriginal proposal that the question should be postponed only for a fortnight.
STATUE INMEMORY of the LATEPTELD MARSHALsSARL HAIG-.(previous reference:Cabinet 4(28), Con-o Tus ion 2 .)8. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the First Commissioner of Works (Paper C.P.-323 (28)) in regard to the site of the statue tobe erected out of monies voted by Parliament inmemory of the late Field Marshal Earl Halg.   Inthis Memorandum the Marquess of Londonderryproposed to overrule the Westminster City council under the provisions of an Act passed in 1854 andto adopt a site suggested by the Royal Fine art commission, the statue to be placed opposite theportico of the Scottish Office, in Whitehall,where the street is of considerable width andthere is no side traffic, and in consequencethere are no great objections from the point ofview of traffic .The Cabinet were informed that the king had originally felt doubts as to the expediency of placing Earl Haig&apos;s statue close to the Cenotaph,but that on learning that the site now proposed was 200 yards from the Cenotaph His Majesty&apos;s objections had been removed.The Cabinet approved the proposalsof the First Commissioner of Workscontained in Paper CP .-32 3 (28).
9. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Minister of Health (Paper C.P.-330 (28))covering a Local Government Bill, together withthe recommendations of the Committee of Home affairs thereon (H.A.C. 10th Conclusions (28), Paras. 1-3)inclusiv e.Shortly before the Cabinet Meeting theMinister of Health circulated a revise of the11th Schedule attached to the draft Bill.The Cabinet were informed of suggestions which had been made by the Chancellor of theExchequer for lightening the Bill and so reducingto some extent the great strain which was likely tobe placed on Members of Parliament owing to thetime required to pass so long a Bill,, as well as of the Minister of Health&apos;s objections to theseproposals (See H.A.C. 10th Conclusions (28), Para.2- Appendix ,11 to these Minutes - and Paper C ,P.-330 (28)).The Minister of Health, while pressing for the inclusion of all the 17 Clauses concernedrespectively with Part II, Registration&apos;; Part III,Town Planning; Part IV, Local Government (paper cp.-330 (28) Para,2), which were in discussion aspossibly unessential, suggested that in his state-ment on the Second Reading of the Bill he should include a passage explaining that these Clauseshad been inserted not as essential to the Bill butin order to facilitate good government and, inter alia.t to establish the Registrars on a properfooting, as recommended by the Onslow Commissionand actually passed by the House of Commons in theGunston Bill of last Session which had failed to
pass the House of Lords in the pressure- of thelast few days of the Session.   At the same time he proposed to give warning that if the Clauses weresubjected to heavy criticism it would not bepossible to pass them through in the pressure ofParliamentary time and they would have to be withdrawn, but he would make an appeal to Parlia-m0nt not to lose this opportunity for passing them.If he were compelled in these circumstances towithdraw them, he would be in a position to informthose who were specially interested in these clauses that it had not been ;pos sible to pass them.In the course of the discussion questions were raised in regard to the Public assistance committee provided for in Clause 5 of the Bill,but the Cabinet decided to make no alteration inthis part of the Bill.The Cabinet agreed -fa) To approve the Local Government Billin the form of the draft annexed to paper C.P.-330 (28) subject to the modifications adopted by the Committeeof Home Affairs (H.A.C. 10th Conclusions(28)) and to any drafting or other minor alterations that might be foundnecessary or desirable, and toauthorise its introduction in theHouse of Commons as soon as possible after the re-assembling of Parliament:(b) That the Minister of Health shouldmake a statement in regard to the registration, ToT.&apos;&quot;n Planning, andLooal Government clauses in accordancewith the proposals he had made tothe Cabinet, summarised above.
ATTNG REFORM. 10. In the co-arse of the discussion&quot;referxedreight Relief        to in the preceding Conclusion, the President ofn Canals andplvate Railways,   the Board of Trade reported that representationshad been made to him by a Deputation-of personsPreviousReference! concerned in private railways and of interestedCabinet 48(28), Con- Members of Parliament, as well as the reply whichelusion 5.)he had made in accordance with the previous decision of the Cabinet referred to in the margin.   Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister stated that,while standing firm on the Cabinet decision, he hadnot felt it right to refuse to report to his colleagues the representations which had been made to him.by the Deputation.The Cabinet confirmed their previous decision that privaterailways must be excluded fromthe railway pool and left withsuch benefits as they would ultimately receive as &quot;industrialhereditaments&quot; .
Ithe local GOVERNMENTI(SCOTLAND)iEILL.c e^(previous Refereno e:j Cabinet 351 (28), Corl-! elusion 4.). 11. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum   -by the Secretary of State for Scotland covering adraft Local Government (Scotland)  Bill (paper.A.-26 (28)), together with the recommendationsof the Committee of Rome Affairs thereon (H.A.C.11th Conclusions (28), Para.2), and a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for Scotland on theproposed Clause 24  (l) of the Bill (Paper C.P.-332(28)).The Committee of Home Affairs recommended the Cabinet to approve the Local Government (Scotland)Bill in the form of the draft annexed to H.A.-26 (28)subject to (a) determination by the Cabinet of thequestion regarding Clause 24 (l);  (b) the modifica-tion of Clause 29;  (c) the addition of a GoschenLoans clause in an agreed form; and (d) any minoror drafting alterations which may be found necessary or desirable, and to authorise its introduction inthe House of Commons as soon as possible after there-assembling of Parliament.Clause 24 (l), which the Committee of HomeAffairs reserved for the Cabinet, empowered CountyAuthorities to incur expenditure in paying necessarytravelling expenses and allowances to members ofthe Authority and its Committees.   As a result of strong pressure, in Scotland it was now proposed toextend the provision to Town Councils and to includepayment for lost time.An issue had arisen at the Committee ofHome Affairs in regard to this proposal.   The Ministerof Health had warned the Committee of the veryserious reactions which, the insertion of the provisions in the Scottish Bill would have in England.   He had so far resisted similar demands from the County
Councils Association, but if the provisions appeared in the&apos;Scottish Eill it would be most difficult to resist an English demand for like treatment.The Committee of Home Affairs had agreedto report to the Cabinet that in their view itwould be preferable that Clause 21 should be omitted from the Bill as introduced, but that, having regardto the attitude of public opinion in Scotlandtowards the subject, it may be found necessary tomake some concession at e later date.    In this latter event the Committee of Home Affairs consideredthat the provision should be limited in the mannerset out in Clause 24 (l) of the Bill and should notbe extended to Town Councils or to time lost, asproposed in the revised draft of the clause.In his Memorandum (Paper CP.-332 ( 28))the Secretary of State for Scotland g.ave the reasons which presented hir. from acquiescing in the recom-mendation o^ the Committee of Home Affairs .After a discussion which followed the same lines as at the Committee of Home Affairs (H.A.C.11th Conclusions (28), Para.2) (Appendix in) T theSecretary of State &quot;^or Scotland eventually offered to provide in the ?iil for limiting the power to incur expenditure to County Councils, omittingTown Councils as well as payment for lost time,  andthe Cabinet accepted this proposal.The Cabinet/agreed  To approve the Local Government (Scotland)Bill in the  -form of the draft annexed with.A.--26 (28), subject  to -* (a) The re-drafting of&apos; Clause 24 (l)so as to limit the power to incurexpenditure in paying necessary&apos; travelling expenses and allowances to County Authorities (omittingTown Councils) and omitting payment

Appendix I.0 -THE PERSIAN GULF.Extract from Interim Report of a Sub-Committee of the Committee ofImperial Defence.(Paper No. CP. 321 (28).)*J  4fc *X* *S*PART V.-SUMMARY OP CONCLUSIONS.British Desiderata.114. (a) The maintenance of British supremacy in the Persian Gulf is, if anything, more essential to the security of India and to Imperial interests at thepresent time than it was in the past.(b) Our interests are exposed to dangers not less in degree, though differing in kind, from those to which they were liable in the past. Modem developments,such as air power and cross-country traction, and more particularly the probability of the construction of a railway between Northern Persia and the Gulf, haveincreased the potential risks to which our interests are exposed.(c) In order to maintain our supremacy it is necessary to prevent any foreign power from establishing a naval base or fortified port in the Persian Gulf, or airundertakings within striking distance of the Gulf. We must retain sufficientharbour facilities in the Gulf for our Navy, and these must be convenientlysituated for the operation of minesweeping and other vessels required to safeguard the sea passage through the Gulf in time of war. We should press on with themeasures required to establish and secure our strategic and civil air routes along the shores of the Gulf. On the Arabian littoral we should retain the status quoin its entirety. On the Persian littoral we should maintain the status quo to theutmost limit that political considerations will admit.id) It is important to develop the air routes on both sides of the Gulf, namely,the civil air route along the Persian shore and the strategic air route along the arabian shore. No immediate initiative, however, should be taken to try and obtain from the Persian Government an extension of the three years at presentgranted for the operation of the civil air route, but he should have instructions to insist on Persia carrying out in the spirit their side of the arrangements madewith Imperial Airways. On the Arabian side of the Gulf every possible effort should be made by political means to prepare the way for the development of theair route. Wherever the conditions are favourable, early steps should be takento secure the necessary aerodromes and facilities, and, if necessary, financialconsideration should be given to the Chiefs concerned for this purpose.Political Considerations.(e) From a political point of view the services we have rendered to civilisationand humanity in the Gulf, by the suppression of piracy, the slave trade and the arms traffic, the maintenance of order, the provision and upkeep of aids to navigation, &amp;c, place us in a strong moral position. In many of the detailedmatters in dispute between Persia and ourselves, however, our legal title is weak.(/) In Persia there has been a strong revival of nationalism under the stimulus of the present Shah, who, after establishing the authority of the CentralGovernment over the greater part of Persia, is now seeking to reduce our positionin the Gulf. Though Persia is incapable of undertaking efficiently the functionswe now fulfil, or of ejecting us by force, the weakness of our legal status, combined with Persia&apos;s membership of the League of Nations, creates for us a position ofsome difficulty.[13421]
(g) Our wisest course in the present circumstances is to avoid reference tothe League of Nations if we can, and to endeavour to reach a general settlement with Persia on the lines of Conclusion (1) below.(h) On the Arabian shore of the Gulf our position is governed by a series of treaties placing under our protection the territories of the rulers of Koweit,Bahrein, the Trucial Chiefs, and, for practical purposes, Muscat, the independence of which, however, His Majesty&apos;s Government and France jointly guarantee to respect. The rise of the Wahabi Chief, Ibn Saud, to hegemony over the greaterpart of the Arabian Peninsula is a disturbing factor in our political relations withthe Chiefs concerned, as well as in the development of the southern air route.(i) The best way in which the menace of the Wahabis and the danger oftheir conquest or absorption of the Sheikhs can be averted is by securing the friendship of Ibn Saud. This will take time. In the meanwhile it is essential tosupport the Sheikhs by an active demonstration of our will and power to protect their legitimate l-ights in accordance with our Treaties. In the forthcoming negotiations with Persia our representative should have instructions that it is anessential part of our policy to defend the Sheikhs on the Arabian shore againstthe claims of the Persian Government.Naval Precautions.(/) Although we think it improbable that the Persians will attempt to prejudice the forthcoming negotiations by forcible action, we recommend in orderto be on the safe side, that the Admiralty should instruct the Naval Commander-in-Chief that the status quo is to be maintained in the Gulf and that he is toprevent (even by force, in the last resort) the occupation by Persia of Tamb andAbu Musa Islands.The Persian Debt.(k) The remission of the Persian War Debt of  1,510,000, in whole or in part,represents by far the strongest if not the only really big counter in our possessionin the forthcoming negotiations. The Government of India have already offered to waive the whole of their half share of the debt, if necessary. Although wehave had no opportunity of discussing this matter with the Chancellor of theExchequer, we venture to make a strong representation to the Cabinet that, as ;icondition of a complete settlement, and only on that condition, Sir Robert Oliveshould be given authority to include the remission of a part or, in the last resort,of the whole of this debt.The Detailed Negotiations.(I) We recommend that Sir Robert Clive&apos;s instructions should be based onthe above general considerations, and, as regards details, on the following lines : (i) He should insist on the retention of our present privileges at Hen jamfor the longest possible period (minimum 25 years).(ii) He should refuse to treat the Persian claim to Bahrein as open to discussion,and should press for the withdrawal of the question from the Leagueof Nations as part of the general settlement. He should bear in mind the great importance of Bahrein from the point of view of the air routealong the Arabian shore of the Gulf.(iii) lie should insist on the claims of the Trucial Chiefs to Tamb and AbuMusa Islands.(iv) He should endeavour to maintain the substance of the Slavery convention of 1882 in the form most acceptable to the Persian Government.(v) He should be guided by the conclusions set out in paragraph 98, and should endeavour to retain the wireless station at Henjam under british control, that is to say, to be worked by the Indo-European TelegraphDepartment for the remainder of their concession up to 1945.(vi) He should endeavour to maintain, if the Persians raise the question, thegeneral British control of lighting and buoying throughout the Gulf,but should be at liberty to use the face-saving concessions recommendedby the Government of India and printed above in para. 95.(vii) He should insist on Persia carrying out in. the spirit her side of thearrangements made with Imperial Airways of three years&apos; permission to fly along the Gulf.   (See also Conclusion (cl).)
(viii) He should suggest.,to the Persian Government the recognition of Iraq, inreturn for Iraq agreeing to Persian representation on the Basrah PortTrust and certain modifications in the frontier along the Shatt-al-Arab.For this purpose His Majesty&apos;s Government would lend their good offices with a view to placing Perso-Iraq relations on a footing whichwould lead to the establishment of treaty relations.(ix) He should press for a settlement of the Duzdab Railway on the basisproposed, and bear in mind its importance as a factor in generalnegotiations.(x) He should offer a settlement of outstanding commercial claims, including that of the Persian Railway Syndicate, for an inclusive sum of . 250,000to  300,000.(N.B. Most of these claims are War claims which the PersianGovernment will never admit. They total about  1,250,000. It isbelieved that many claimants have simply written them off. Sir RobertClive believes that if the Persian Government coidd be induced to pay 250,000 in final settlement of this account this would be satisfactory.&quot;)(xi) He should endeavour to get the Persian Government to embody in theCommercial Treaty the safeguards mentioned in letters exchanged onthe 10th May, 1928.*(xii) He should be authorised to offer the following concessions in return for asatisfactory settlement: (1) To relinquish the most-favoured-nation clause in the peace treaty of 1857 and to accept a most-favoured-nation clausefor a limited period of eight years the period proposed forthe new Commercial Treaty.(2) To relinquish our prescriptive rights to Basidu.(3) To make Persia a present of two out of the three wireless stations.(4) Our goodwill in any negotiations with Iraq for the rectification-tion of the frontier on the Shatt-al-Arab.(5) The remission of  1,510,000 War Debt (see Conclusion (k)above).* Note. These matters have not come before the Sub-Committee, but are understood to be acceptable tothe Departments concerned. They are therefore included in the heads of Sir Robert Clive&apos;s instructions,dthough we, as a Sub-Committee, take no responsibility for them.
CABINET.COMMITTEE  OF  HOME  AFFAIRS 10 (28).Extract from Conclusions of a Meeting of the Committee held in the    Moses &quot; Room,House of Lords, S.W.1, on Monday, October 29, 1928, at 3 p.m.-V Jt, ,37. M. -V.,-vv w w *c -A&quot; ifThe Local Govern- 1.   With reference to H.A.C. 9th Conclusions (28), theCommittee continued their examination of the draft Local Govern-ment Bill and had before them the Memorandum by the Ministerof Health (H.A. 25 (28)), covering Parts I-V of the Bill, andNotes on the Clauses contained in Parts I, II, IV and V of the Bill,a further Memorandum by the Minister of Health (H.A. 32 (28)),covering Part III (revised) and Parts VI, VII and VIII of the Bill,with the Schedules belonging to those Parts and explanatory Notesand a Memorandum by the Minister of Transport on the trans-mission of benefit of rates relief in respect of freight transporthereditaments and the railway freight rebate scheme (H. A. 33(28)).2, The Minister of Health stated that he now understoodthat the proposal of the Chancellor of the Exchequer was thatParts II, IV, VII and VIII and the clauses pf Part III relatingto Town Planning should be referred to a Grand Committee, theChairman of which should be empowered to select amendments,and the Committee should be directed to report to the House bya certain date. Any clauses not passed by the Committee on thatdate to be considered on the floor of the House, time being speciallyset aside for this purpose. The nature of the more importantprovisions of Parts VII and VIII of the Bill made it necessarythat those Parts should be taken on the floor of the House, there remained only Part II, Part IV and the Town Planning clauses of Part III. In his view, if the whole Bill was taken in theHouse, only two days of the Committee stage would be requiredfor these provisions (half a day for Part II, 1 day for Part IV and half a day for the Town Planning Clauses). Under the Chancellorof the Exchequer^ proposal time would have to be found for thespecial Resolution empowering the Chairman of the Committeeto select amendments, there would be intense obstruction in theCommittee with the object of ensuring that as many as possible of the provisions remitted to the Committee should remain over for consideration by the House, and extra time would be requiredfor these provisions and for the Report stage of clauses passedby the Committee.    Having regard to these considerations, he[18393 a] - bHouse of CommonsProcedure in regardto the Bill.SECRET.H.A.C. 10th Conclusions (28).
(Mr. Chamberlain) could not see what, if any, practical advantage,from the point of view of saving time or otherwise, would result from the proposal.The Chancellor of the Exchequer emphasized the importance ^of considering the arrangements for the Parliamentary conductof the Bill in conjunction with the general plans of the Govern-ment for 1929. There should, in any case, be a month&apos;s recess at christmas, so as to avoid any undue strain on Members. under his proposal to divide the Bill, any parts which failed to passnext Session could be enacted in the first session of the new parliament; in this way, the scheme as a whole, would be placed before the public. If, however, this proposal was unacceptable,he was convinced that every effort should be made to lighten theBill by omitting everything which was not absolutely essential togive effect to the main scheme.The Minister of Health said that he had confined his argumentto the point of saving time, and had shown that under theChancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s proposal no appreciable time wouldbe saved. A careful examination of the Bill would prove thatthere were comparatively few provisions which were not essentialto the success of the main scheme, the provisions which will be opposed are the essential provisions. It would be a mistake to cut down the Bill at the present stage. Experience showed thatafter passage of the guillotines resolution, the opposition crumbles.The time to jettison clauses would be after the publication of theBill and the putting down of amendments.The Secretary of State for War pointed out the political objections to withdrawing provisions after the Bill was published.The Secretary of State for Scotland warned the Committeethat a decision to send portions of the English Bill to a Committeewould give rise to a demand that parts of the Scottish Bill should go to the Scottish Grand Committee. Such a demand must be resisted at all costs.The President of the Boaird of Trade thought that it wouldbe very difficult to secure a quorum for the Committee, and thatthe arrangements suggested by the Chancellor of the exchequer would impose a very severe strain on the loyalty of the Govern-ment&apos;s supporters. He had no doubt at all that if the choice laybetween the Chancellor&apos;s proposal and an extra three days in committee on the floor of the House, the Government&apos;s supporters would unanimously favour the latter. They would certainlyobject to giving the Chairman &quot; kangaroo &quot; powers.After some further discussion the Minister of Healthexpressed the view that the wisest course would be to present theBill as a whole to Parliament, and if necessary to drop someportions of it before the &quot; guillotine &quot; resolution was taken.The Committee agreed (1.) To draw the attention of the Cabinet to the suggestions of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the criticisms of the Minister of Health outlined above, and to invitethe Cabinet to determine the procedure to be followed in the House of Commons in regard to the Bill.And, in order to enable the Cabinet to arrive at adecision (2.) To request the Minister of Health to arrange for the circulation to the Cabinet of a Memorandum showing&apos; . what clauses of the Bill could, if necessary, be abandoned without prejudicially affecting the mainscheme.
SIExamination of the 3.   With reference to the discussion at the previous MeetingBill (continued). (H.A.C., 9th Conclusions (28)), the Minister of Health informedPart 1. the Committee that the Attorney-General was satisfied with the explanations which had been given respecting the powers inregard to Local Authorities conferred upon the Minister through-out the Bill. Clauses 5 and 6 would be suitably amended to meetthe points raised by the Lord Chancellor.With regard to Clause 13, the cost of the total removal of the poor Law disqualification in the case of Old Age Pensioners was estimated by the Treasury at  If millions per annum. After some discussion the Minister of Health suggested that the law should beleft unaltered in regard to this matter. This suggestion was accepted by the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, and theCommittee agreed That Clause 13 of the Bill should be deleted.The Minister of Health informed the Committee that it was proposed to modify Clause 17 to meet the views of the LondonCounty Council.Arrangements would be made to enable other minor altera-tions of Clause 17 desired by the Council to be made at theCommittee stage.The Committee adopted the provisions of Part I of the Billsubject to the modifications mentioned above.parfc. n The Minister of Health informed the Committee that Part ii of the Bill substantially reproduces the provisions of the GunstonBill of last Session. The Secretary of State for Scotland observedthat if the English Bill contained provisions dealing&apos; withregistrars of births, deaths and marriages, he should like to makesimilar provision in the Scottish Bill. The issue was not yet,however, an agreed question in Scotland as was the case inEngland and Wales.The Committee adopted the provisions of Part II of the Bill.p . tjj The Minister of Transport explained the object of the roadprovisions (Clauses 31-37) of Part III of the Bill.The Solicitor-General drew attention to the nature of the discretion to be given to the County Council under sub-clauses (2)and (3) of Clause 36. The Minister of Health agreed to considerthe insertion of the words &quot;an absolute&quot; before &quot;discretion&quot; in line 2 of sub-clause (3)..The Minister of Health explained that the Town planningprovisions of Part III are consequential on the derating scheme.The transfer of roads to the County Councils made it necessary toconfer on those Councils town planning powers which they do notat present possess. The Committee were informed that it wasimpossible to abreviate the town planning provisions on the linesfollowed in the case of the Scottish Bill.The Committee agreed To adopt the provisions of Part III of the Bill subject tothe proposed modification of Clause 36 (3).Part IV. The Committee agreed To adopt the provisions of Part IV of the Bill subject tofurther consideration of the expression in the proviso to clause 45 (1) &quot; councils of the county boroughs adjoiningthe county&apos;&apos; as applicable to county boroughs, such asBristol, which are outside but adjoin a county boundary.Part v- The Lord Privy Seal drew attention to the wording of clause 62 and expressed the hope that it might be found possible118393 a] b 2
to extend the concession to any cottage occupied by a farmlabourer. Doubts were expressed as to.the practicability of suchan extension, but the Minister of Health undertook to consider thepoint.The Committee agreed To adopt the provisions of Part V of the Bill subjectto further consideration by the Minister of Health of thequestion arising on Clause 62, and subject also to further examination by the Treasury, Ministry of Health and board of Education of the effect of Clause 64 of the Billon the Central Welsh Board.The Committee agreed to adopt the provisions of Part vi of the Bill subject to the modification of Clause 87 (1) by thesubstitution after the word &quot;Minister&quot; in line 41 of the words&quot;a scheme which the Minister approves&quot; for the words &quot;such ascheme.&quot;The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries drew attention tothe provisions in the Eighth Schedule relating to payment to the cattle Pleuro-Pneumonia account, and warned the Committeethat in times of emergency it would be necessary for the treasury to find large sums for this service at very short notice. TheFinancial Secretary to the Treasury undertook to look into thematter.The Committee^agreed to adopt the provisions of Part VII ofthe Bill.Attention was drawn to the provisions of Clause 110 (4), underwhich certain transferred teachers in Poor Law Institutions will come under the Teachers&apos; Superannuation Act of 1925 and will pay full contributions, whereas, under the earlier part of theclause, ordinary transferred Poor Law Officers will obtain thebenefit of reduced superannuation contributions. The committee agreed to retain the clause as drafted.The President of the Board of Trade summarised the arrange-ments set out in H.A. 33 (28) for the transmission of the benefit of rate relief in respect of freight transport hereditaments(Clause 119), and the railway freight rebate scheme (FifteenthSchedule). Special attention was drawn to the proposals for the review of rebates set out in the Annex hereto, which were still under negotiation with the Railway Companies. The president said that he desired authority to conclude an arrangement on theselines.The Committee agreed to adopt the provisions of Part viii of the Bill, subject to the insertion in sub-clauses 5 (6) and 5 (c)respectively of Part I of the Fifteenth Schedule of the words&quot;seventh-tenths&quot; and &quot; one-tenth,&quot; and to recommend theCabinet to authorise the inclusion in Clause 9 of the same schedule of provisions to give effect to the proposals on the lines of those setout in the Annex hereto.The Committee were informed that efforts would be made toreduce the number of Schedules in the final draft of the Bill.The Parliamentary Secretary of the Board of Educationpointed out that the Clause in the Scottish Bill which makes provision for a consolidated rate also provides that every demandnote shall, instead of showing the. amount in the pound of, or inrespect of, each separate rate, show the amount of the expenditure.She feared that unless similar arrangements were made in regardto demand notes in England, a false impression might be createdas to the cost of education, since, when de-rating took place, theamount in the pound levied in respect of education would apparently go up, although the actual expenditure might not beincreased. This might be very prejudicial to the cause ofeducation.The Minister of Health undertook to look into the matter.
Proposals for Review of Rebates.In fixing the rebates under the scheme, the Bail way Bates Tribunal willbe authorised to set aside a reserve not exceeding 5 per cent, of the net revenue of the Fund as a margin against contingencies.The Tribunal to review the operation of the scheme annually.It it is found in any year that the cost of the rebates has exceeded theamount available in the Fund after setting aside a margin, half the amount ofthe deficiency to be paid into the Fund by the Bailway Companies and halfcharged against the reserve for contingencies.If the reserve be exhausted, the balance of deficiency to be carried forward and a revision of the rebates to take place.If the reserve is not exhausted, the balance of the reserve will be carried forward in the Fund. Such new provision for reserve will be made as theTribunal allow, but no revision of rebates will, take place.If, on review, it appears that any of the three groups of traffic is likely toobtain less than its prescribed proportion of the Fund in that year by an amountsufficient to increase its rebate by 1 per cent., the Tribunal is to revise therebates so as to afford to the group as nearlv as may be its proportion ofthe Fund.The rebates of other groups would not in such a case be reduced unless, inthe TribunaFs opinion, reductions were necessary to avoid such a deficiency inthe Fund at the end of the year as, after allowing for the Companies&apos;contribution, would exceed the reserve for contingencies.^ 4fc $fc ^2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,October 29, 1928.The Committee agreed to recommend the Cabinet To approve the Local Government Bill in the form of thedraft annexed to H.A. 25 (28) and H.A. 32 (28), subjectto the modifications adopted by the Committee, and toany drafting or other minor alterations that may befound necessary or desirable, and, subject to the decisionof the Cabinet on the question of the procedure to beadopted with regard to the Bill, to authorise its intro-duction in the House of Commons as soon as possible after the reassembling of Parliament.ANNEX.Local Government Bill.Railway Frcujht Rebate Scheme.

and allowances to members of the authority and its com-mittees. As a result of strong pressure in Scotland, it was now proposed to extend the provision to town councils and toinclude payment for lost time the revised clause 24 (1) to read : (1.) It shall be lawful for a county authority or towncouncil to incur expenditure in paying allowancesat uniform rates to be prescribed by the Secretaryof State in respect of (a) travelling and otherpersonal expenses necessarily incurred, and(b) time necessarily lost from ordinary employ-ment, by members of the authority or council orof any committee or sub-committee thereof inattending meetings of such authority councilcommittee or sub-committee.The Secretary of State for Scotland reminded the Committeethat since 1918 the members of the Education Authorities inScotland had been allowed their travelling, &amp;c, expenses. Thetransfer of the poor law and other functions under the present bill from the Parish Councils and District Committees to thecounty authorities was the justification for extending the 1918principle as proposed. To exclude payment for loss of time would prevent genuine working men from being members of the countyauthorities. In his view the provisions in question were vitalfrom the point of view of the Government&apos;s Scottish supporters in the House of Commons, and it was clear that there was an overwhelming body of opinion in Scotland in favour of theextension of the principle of payment of expenses to all authorityactivities.The Minister of Health warned the Committee of the veryserious reactions which the insertion of the provisions in theScottish Bill would have in England. He had so far resistedsimilar demands from the County Councils Association, but if theprovisions appeared in the Scottish Bill it would be most difficultto resist an English demand for like treatment. The clause in itslatest form was very much more objectionable than the clause inthe Bill. He would view with considerable alarm the probable effects on the personnel of English Local Authorities which wouldresult from the acceptance of the principle of payment of theirexpenses.After considerable discussion the Committee agreed to reportto the Cabinet that in their view it would be preferable that clause 24 should be omitted from the Bill as introduced, but that,having regard to the attitude of public opinion in Scotlandtowards the subject, it may be found necessary to make some concession at a later stage. In this event the Committee considerthat the provision should be limited in the manner set out in 24 (1)of the Bill, and should not be extended to town councils or to timelost, as proposed in the revised draft of the clause.(C.) The Committee were warned that the proposals in theSecond Schedule for the union of certain counties may give rise tosome discussion.(D.) The Committee were informed that, it would be necessaryto insert in the Bill a clause dealing with Goschen Loans on thelines of the provisions in the English Bill. The Committeerequested the Secretary of State for Scotland to settle the draftclause in question in consultation with the Treasury before submitting it to the Cabinet.
The Committee agreed to recommend the Cabinet To approve the Local Government (Scotland) Bill in theform of the draft annexed to H.A. 26 (28), subject to(a) determination by the Cabinet of the questionregarding clause 24 (1); (b) the modification of clause 29;(c) the addition of a Goschen Loans clause in an agreedform; and (d) any minor or drafting alterations whichmay be found necessary or desirable, and to authorise its introduction in the House of Commons as soon as possible after the reassembling of Parliament.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,October 31, 192S.
APPENDIX.XFThe King&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament.November 6, 1928.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons,MY relations with foreign Powers continue to be friendly.My Government have been happy to accept the Treaty for the Renunciation of&quot;War in the form proposed by the Government of the United States. To My great satisfaction this Treaty was signed in Paris on the 27th August by Plenipotentiarieson behalf of all My Governments, and on behalf of the United States, France,Germany, Italy, Japan, Belgium, Poland and Czecho-Slovakia.In pursuance of their fixed policy My Government have continued to accordtheir full support to the League of Nations.&apos; They are co-operating in all its currentactivities, and in particular they have sought fully to discharge their obligations under Article 8 of the Covenant by reducing the armed forces of this country to the lowest point consistent with national safety and by assisting the League to formulateplans for a general reduction of armaments.Agreement has been reached with the Governments of Belgium, France,Germany, Italy and Japan that negotiations should be opened in regard to thepossibility of a complete and definite settlement of the problem of reparations; andit has also been recognised that negotiations should take place relative to the GermanGovernment^ request for the evacuation of the Rhineland at present occupied byBritish, French and Belgian troops.The Coronation of the Emperor of Japan is shortly to take place, and I take this opportunity, in the name of Myself and My people, of wishing His imperial majesty a long and glorious reign. The historic friendship which for so many years has united Japan and My country has always been a potent factor in themaintenance of peace in the Far East.I welcome the efforts which China is making to establish a central governmentfor the whole of that great country and to cope with those forces of disorder whichhave distracted it for many years past. I regard the progress of these endeavoursas being of the highest importance, not only for the safety and prosperity of Mysubjects resident in China, but also for the peace of the world.Members of the House of Commons,The Estimates for the services in the coming year will be laid before you in due course. They are being prepared with strict attention to the continuing need for economy in public expenditure. In anticipation of the general scheme for relievingagriculture and productive industry from the burden of rates, you will be asked tomake provision enabling railway companies to make lower charges on importanttraffics of concern to agriculture, and to the coal, iron and steel industries.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons,The situation in the mining areas continues to engage the earnest attention ofMy Ministers, who are taking energetic steps to promote the success of the schemeof industrial transference and migration. The abnormal expenditure out of theUnemployment Fund entailed by the displacement of labour from the mines willrender necessary an increase of borrowing powers, and a Bill dealing with thisquestion will be laid before you.18384
aMeasures will be presented to you for giving effect in this country and inScotland to the comprehensive scheme which has been prepared by My Ministers forthe reform of the rating system on a more equitable basis, for the reorganisation oflocal government and for the readjustment of the financial relations between the Stateand the Local Authorities.I trust that the relief from the burden of rates afforded under the scheme maybenefit agriculture and lead to a greater measure of employment in industry generally, and in particular in those basic trades whose condition still causesconcern. The proposed changes in local government and in the relations betweenthe Exchequer and Local Authorities are measures of far-reaching importance. my ministers anticipate that they will promote efficiency and economy in local govern-ment, will enable better provision to be made for the health of the people, and willdirect assistance particularly to those areas whose needs are most pressing.Proposals for extending the Export Credits Guarantee Scheme for a further period will be laid before you.You will be invited to pass a Bill authorising the appointment of two additional members of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council and of one additional Lordof Appeal in Ordinary.Among other Measures a Bill for assisting persons engaged in agriculture inScotland to obtain credits required for the pursuit of their industry will beintroduced.And I pray that the blessing of Almighty God may rest upon your deliberations.
