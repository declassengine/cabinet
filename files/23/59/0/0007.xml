THE EARL OP 1. The Cabinet authorised the Prime Minister,balfour.who was about to visit the Earl of Balfour,who for some time had been indisposed at his home in Scotland, to convey a message of goodwill to their colleague.
THE ELEOTTTGITYBOARD.(previous reference:Cabinet 8(26), Con-elusion 15,2. The Cabinet agreed -That a Cabinet Committee, composed as follows -The Lord Chancellor (in the Chair),The Secretary of State for War,The President of the Board of trade the Minister of Transport -should meet to consider the presentposition of the work, of the electricity board .
HiMEMBERS !)fTHE cabinet and MAGAZINEARTICLES.(previous reference:Cabinet 28(24), Con-clusion 4.)3.    The Prime Minister said that he had been consulted by certain Ministers as to whether itwould be within the terms of the Cabinet decisionof January 26, 1923 (Cabinet 3 (23) Conclusion 7)for them to write magazine articles on such subjects as Housing, Slum Clearance, Rating Reform, and othercomplicated Departmental matters on which it was desirable to enlighten the public.The Cabinet were informed that such articleswere being written, or likely to be written, bysome of the Opposition leaders.In the course o^ the discussion it was suggestedthat articles of this kind should be confined to matters affecting a Minister&apos;s own Department.The Cabinet agreed  That the writing of magazine articlesby Ministers to supplement meansalready used for enlightening thepublic in regard to measures beforeParliament and other administrativequestions should not be deemed toinfringe the Cabinet decision ofJanuary 26, 1923.
4.    The Minister of Health raised, as a matterof urgency, the question of the Housing Subsidy.He recalled that last March,  at the Meeting referredto in the margin, the Cabinet had sanctioned his proposal for a reduction equivalent to  50 in theHousing Subsidy for England and Wales,  aa well ascontemporaneous reductions proposed by the Secretaryof State for Scotland.   He had since receivedDeputations from the Local Authorities who hadobjected to the reduction.    They had objected tothe previous reduction, but in the event their objections had proved unfounded.   While he stillfelt  justified in making a cut of  50 per house,he was bound to inform his colleagues that thiswould^ &amp;s*&amp;e       . -a-effect or? Local Authorities, andhe had come to the conclusion that it would bebetter to confine the complete cut of  50 per house to the houses built under the 19 23 Act and to reducethe cut for houses built under the 1924 Act to  25.These cuts should apply from the 1st October, 1929.The Secretary or State for Scotland said thaton the previous occasion the cut in the HousingSubsidy had not applied to Scotland.   He also had recently had mie-tings with Scottish Local Authori-ties who had asked for a continuance of the present-rate of Subsidy.   At the same time he thought theLocal Authorities were not unprepared for a cut onthe present occasion, and, in his opinion, a cut was desirable.   Re would like, if the Minister of Healthwas authorised to make the cuts of  50 and  2 5referred to, that he himself should announce a cut of  25 in the Subsidies payable tinder the 1923 and1924 Acts, - thus following exactly what theMinister of Health had  one on the occasion of theprevious revision.   He also wished that the cut in
Scotland should come into operation as from the dateproposed ^or England.    He hoped the announcement would he made as soon as possible.The Cabinet approved the above proposals.
5.   The Acting Secretary of State for foreign affaire, while asking for no decision fron theCabinet,  called attention to the urgency of anearly discussion in regard to Anglo-american relations ,   In reply to a request for informationas to what the point of action was, Lord Cushendunsaid it was necessary to consider,  first, theeffect of the Kellogg Pact on policy vis-a-vis the United States of America:    second,  the PrimeMinister&apos;s statement that we did not intend tobuild competitively against the United States ofAmerica:    third, various problems now beforeCommittees, such as the renewal of the arbitration treaty and the reply to be made to a possibleinvitation to a Conference on Belligerent Rights a^ wl$Lsoh, Lord Gushendun suggested, could hardly bedealt with as a single item on a Cabinet Agendabut would require a special Meeting.In the course of a short discussion thesuggestion was made that, having regard to thenature of President Coolidge&apos;s recent statement,our relations with America might better be promoted by allowing time to do its work,  and that in any event it would be better to postpone discussionsuntil after the Kellogg Pact is ratified:    the newPresident was installed; and our own GeneralElection had taken place.It was pointed out, however, that there mightbe some questions       immediate urgency,  3uch as,for example, the reply to the American Mote on theAnglo-French compromise proposals for reduction and limitation of naval armaments.
The Prime Minister reminded his colleagues that the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs would have returned to London before the next regular weekly Meeting of the Cabinet.    Sir AustChamberlain would, no doubt, consider the whole situation and ask for consideration of thesequestions by the Cabinet as soon as he deemed it advisable.
RUSSIA.iExport ofIArms to .(previous reference:Cabinet 51(28),  Con-clusion 1.)6. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the First Lord of the Admiralty (Paper CP.-349(28)) to the effect that the Board of Admiraltyconsider that the risk involved in the supply of motor-boats and mines to Soviet Russia can beaccepted.The Prime Minister read the following note which had been sent to him. by the Permanent secretary&quot;^ the Board of Trade in the absence of thePresident:-&quot;The Admiralty have now circulated a Memorandum in which, for Navalreasons, they favour the placing of the order in this country.   we take the sare view for Trade reasons.If the motor-boats and mines are notsupplied from a British source theywill presumably be obtained elsewhere,and therefore we may as well get theadvantage of the work here.   Wegather from the Admiralty that, fromtheir knowledge of the type of boatcontemplated, the cost of buildingwould be about  15,000 each,  andthat the mines would cost about  200eech&apos;&apos;.The Chancellor of the Exchequer asked to placeon record that, while he accepted the views of theCabinet on this question, he would personally have preferred not to grant permission for -t:he mapx^k7 of -war material to Soviet Russia which might, incertain circumstances, be used against us.The Cabinet agreed  That the Actin? Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs should beauthorised to inform Messrs Vickersthat permission would be grantedthem to carry out an order for thesupply of motor-boats and submarinemines to the Soviet Government.
1 j*7THE INDIANOONTHIBUTTONTO HOMEEFFECTIVECHARGES OFTHE PRTTISHARMY .(previous references:Cabinet 30(28), Con-clusion 10,&quot;  Cabinet31 (28), Con-clusion 2,Nand Cabinet51 (23), Con-conclusion 2.)7 . The Cabinet had before them the&apos; Report ofa Cabinet Committee (Paper CP.-338 (28)) whichhad been appointed on June 6, 1928, with thefollowing Terms of Reference:-&quot;To consider and advise -(l) On the question of the principlewhether there should be a contri-bution by India, and, if thedecision is in the affirmativeon the question of principle,how the claim of the Governmentof India that there should be no contribution by India should bedealt with.(2) Whether the existing contributionwas equitable.(3) What powers could be exercised in the matter vis-^-vis theGovernment of India,  and theSecretary of State for India inCouncil&quot; .The Report of the Cabinet Committee dealtmainly with the third of the questions referredto them, and is summed up in paragraph 11 oftheir Report as follows:-&quot;After examination of the legal position,we have reached the conelueion that &quot;toielegal right to refuse to make any additional payment in respect of the contribution is vested in theSecretary of State for India inCouncil.We find, further, that the Secretaryof State in Council hjas a legal rightto refuse to submit any question of liability or amount to arbitration and the Secretary of State is unwilling to ask his Council to agree to submit the question of the amount of thecapitation rate to arbitration, and isonly willing to refer the claim of theGovernment of India for total abolitionto the Indian Statutory Commission;and that the Secretaries of State forWar and Air regard this of&apos;rer asillusory and are unable to accept it&quot;.In reporting this conclusion the Committeeasked for the instructions of the Cabinet as towhether they were to investigate the other mattersincluded in their Terms of Reference.
In addition,  the Cabinet had before them aMemorandum by the Secretary of State for India(Paper C.P.-341 (28)) explaining the difficultieswhich Lord Birkenhead and he had felt in this case.    Lord Peel, in this Memorandum, inter aliaquoted from a reasoned despatch setting out thegrounds on which the Government of India claimed that the capitation rate should be abolished.While willing to submit this- larger question to investigation by the Statutory Commission (among other questions affecting the relations betweenGreat Britain and India), the Government of Indiadid not desire, until the major claim was out ofthe way, that the amount of the capitation rate should either be settled by compromise or besubmitted to arbitration.   In addition. Lord Peelstated that,in the despatch he had quoted, manyof the weightier argum.ents used *y tlie Gov-errrime*rtof India went to support a claim that a contribu-tion towards military expenditure in India shouldbe made from Imperial revenues .   He quoted astatement by the Viceroy to the effect that in actual fact any increase in the capitation ratewhile the Commission&apos;s Inquiry is proceeding wouldhave a very damaging political effect, and pointedout that nothing could prevent the Commission, ifit thought fit,  from reporting to Parliament thatthe decision or the award was inequitable and ought to be annulled.   Lord Peel therefore earnestlybegged his colleagues to allow this difficult question to go before the Simon Commission.
In a Memorandum circulated by tbe Secretaryof State for War (Paper C.P.-347 (38)) Sir laming worthington-Evans pointed out that for theSecretary of State for India to exercise his legalright to refuse to make any additional payment in respect of a contribution to the home effectivecharges of the British Army, or for Great britain to exercise Its legal right to send troops to Indiaor to refuse to send them without pre-payment,would be to take extreme measures hardly compatible with the relationship of members of the BritishEmpire,  and asked the Cabinet to decide -(i) That the Indian Government shall continue to pay &amp; contribution:(ii)  That the Cabinet Committee should report to the Cabinet the amountthey think should be paid.In the event of the Government of India thereaftercontinuing to default, he proposed to bring thematter again to the Cabinet with a proposal forfurther action.The Secretary of State for India also circu-lated a Memorandum -(Paper C.P.-361 (28)) with theobject of illustrating the political atmosphere inIndia as shown by the controversy over the questionof establishing a Secretariat for the LegislativeAs assembly.
In the course of the discussion the Secretof State for India agreed that the Air Ministryclaim for an Increased contribution was on adifferent footing from the War Office claim.After considerable discussion the CabinetagreedThat the Secretary of State for india should send a private telegram to theViceroy representing the strongopinion of the Cabinet that theGovernment of India ought tocontinue to pay a contribution,and should invite Lord Irwin&apos;s views to the political repercussionsa decision to put pressure onthe Government of India in thisdirection .    Lord Twl1 s teloansas?^should include a coTrpromise^Jroposal,ma^hSsin the course o&quot;^ th^aiscussionby th^secretary o^ Sj^Lte for War,for the jvavment of^ome increasedsum&apos; equivail^t^fct) what would be reasonable jj^raR^increased capita-tion ra2^i?^were ado^p^ed, but to be-inclu^d under the luts^ sun nowbeinR paid by India to r*ve Wargfrfice for certain Army seTstices .The Secretary o* State for india was asked to show the draft o^ his telegram to the Secretary of Statefor   &apos;ar before despatch.
fitCHINA.Future ofBritishGarrisons in,(previous reference:Cabinet 48(28),  Con-elusion 4.)8. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for War (Paper C.F.-353 (28))expressing the vie?- that the recent situation inChina shows ao much improvement that it is nowpossible safely to effect a further reduction ofour forces in that country which will bring them down to 6 Battalions, the number which he had previously recommended for our ultimate permanentgarrison in China  (C.I.P. Paper No.900-B andC.P.-278 (28)).    Of the two Battalions to be with-drawn, if this proposal were approved, Sir laming worthington-Evans proposed in his Memorandum thatone, which only left this country for Shanghai onthe 13th Instant, should be stationed at Malta,and pending a decision he stated that he had given instructions for the Battalion to be stopped at malta.   He proposed that the second Battalion,which is in India under orders to proceed to Chinaat an early date,  should be brought direct from Indiato Gibraltar and stationed there.The Acting Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs Informed the Cabinet that a telegram inregard to one o^&quot; the Battalions referred to by theSecretary of State for V/ar had seen sent to theBritish Minister in Peking on the 25th October, butas yet no reply had been received.    He proposed to telegraph again to ascertain Sir Miles Lampson&apos;svie^s .The First Lord informed the Cabinet that theAdmiralty had no remarks to make on the Secretaryof State for :&quot;:arTs proposal.
The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Acting Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs should informthe British Minister at Peking thatone Battalion destined for Chinahad been stopped at Malta and wouldnot be sent on to China, and that,subject to his agreement, the secondBattalion would not be replaced;    sothat our forces in that country wouldbe reduced to 6 Battalions:(b) Subject to Sir Miles Lampson&apos;concurrence, to approve a reductionof our forces in China to 6 Battalions(c) To approve the action of the Secretaryof State for War in stopping one battalion at Malta owing to the considerable economy thereby effected.-IS-
THE RHODES 9^   The Cabinet had before their, a Memorandum byTRUST.the President of the Board of Education (Paper C.P.-345 (28)) asking the authority of the Cabinet togive a blessing in general terms to a proposal ofthe Rhodes Trustees to introduce a Private Billin the present Session altering the terms of theRhodes Trust.    The most important object of theBill would be to alter the present method of select-ing Rhodes Scholars from the United States.    Atpresent each State, whatever its size, has a rightto two Scholars.    It was now proposed that thecountry should be divided into larger regions, to each of which a certain number of Scholarships shouldbe allotted.The Cabinet agreed  That there was no objection to theproposed alteration of the terms ofthe Rhodes Trust.
IRISHFREESTATE .&apos; compensation claims underArticle 10 of[the Articles ofAgreement, 1921(previousJReference:Cabinet 51(28), Con-Ichision 11.)It. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State -for Dominion Affairs (paper c.P.-357 (28)) in regard to the question of compensa-tion to Civil Servants under Article 10 of theArticles of Agreement, .1921.   In this MemorandumMr Amery recalled that in their Report delivered onNovember 13th (a copy of which was annexed to his memorandum) the Judicial Committee of the privy council upheld on every point, although on differentgrounds, the decision of the previous Board inWigg and Cochrane&apos;s case.   The effect of thisReport, and of tha previous decision, was that theCivil Servants concerned, sore 2,000 in number, havebeen declared to be entitled to arrears of pension and lump sum payments estimated by the Treasury to amount to some  50,000 and to a future increase inpension estimated to amount to some  3,000 to 4,000 per annum.   In his Memorandum the Secretaryof State discassed five possible courses of action,and reached the conclusion that the course open tothe least objection was -to decide and announcefo^tliwith tn P-rlias ci11 that-, in purnunnoo of--guortmL^e D&apos;y  Lhh prndeu Htjdura of bhe-pre a en--t Govern--rrerHgy^the British Government would themselves put the Irish Free State Government into a position toP3y the extra sum.s involved in the Judicial Commit-tee&apos;s decision.    The immediate action which he-proposed was that he and the Chancellor of theExchequer should Initiate discussions with FreeState Ministers at the earliest possible date, andthat they should first put before them another ofthe proposals in his Memorandum for sharing the costwith the/Free State Government, on the understandingthat if,  as seemed likely, that course should prove to be unacceptable,  they should have authority toproceed as above.&quot;
The Cabinet agreed  (a) ^hat the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs and the Chancellorof the Exchequer should initiatediscussions with Irish Free StateMinisters at the earliest possible date;    that they should exercisegreat care not to make any admission that the Free State was entitled toflout the decision of the JudicialCommittee of the Privy Council;and that, on the understanding thatthe Judgment of the Judicial Commit-tee was accepted, and only on this understanding, they should beauthorised, if necessary, to statethat His Majesty&apos;a Government wouldBee that the Irish Free State Gov-ernment were not out of pocket bythe decision:(b) That this decision should not beallowed to influence claims of asimilar nature by Civil servants in this country.
11.The Cabinet had before them a Note by theSecretary (Paper CP.-350)) covering a Report bythe Chiefs of Staff and an Extract from the Minutesof the 238th Meeting of the Committee of ImperialDefence in regard to the Powers and Authority of the commanders-in-Chief in China.   The conclusion of theChiefs of Staff, which was approved by the Committeeof Imperial Defence, was to the effect that thepresent instructions of the Commanders-in-chief in China are adequate for any contingency that islikely to arise.The Cabinet took note of and approved this Conclusion.
