1.    The Prime Minister offered, on &quot;behalf ofthe Cabinet, a welcome to their new colleague,Lord Londonderry, pointing out that he was onlythe second new member of the Cabinet since theGovernment had come into office.
THE KING1 S 2. The Cabinet had before them a draft of the speech.King1 s Speech on the Opening of Parliament,(Previous approved by the Lord Chancellor for their con-Reference :Cabinet 47 sideration (Paper CP.-313 (28)).(28), Con-clusion 2.) The Cabinet agreed -(a) That the End and 3rd paragraphsshould be re-drafted so as to put the reference to the Treaty forthe Renunciation of War first,and to touch upon the questionof Disarmament in such a way as not to focus attention on thefailure of the recent attempts to solve the question of naval disarmament.The President of the Board ofEducation was asked to forward to the Lord Chancellor certain suggestions he made to theCabinet to this effect.(b) That the 4th paragraph should bere-drafted ao as to lay less stress on the evacuation of the Rhineland.In this connection the following draft was handed in by the ActingSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs:-*My Ministers have agreed withthe Governments of Belgium,France, Germany, Italy and japan that negotiations shouldbe opened in regard to thepossibility of a complete and definite settlement of theproblem of reparations;    andit has also been recognisedthat negotiations should takeplace relative to the GermanGovernment&apos;s request for theevacuation of the Rhinelandat present occupied by British,Frenoh and Belgian troops.&quot;(c) That the first sentence of the 5th(paragraph should be changed, inaccordance with a suggestion forwardedby Lord Stamfordham, to read asfollows&quot;The Coronation of the Emperor of japan is shortly to take place,and I take this opportunity, inthe name of Myself and My people,of wishing His Imperial Majestya long and glorious reign.&quot;
(d) That the 7th paragraph, referring to the Estimates of the public services, should state that theyare prepared with due regard tothe need for public economy.(e) That the 8th, 9th and 10th para-graphs should be re-drafted andre-arranged by the Minister ofHealth and the Minister of Labour,in concert, who should forwardtheir proposals to the Secretaryof the Cabinet, for the LordChancellor, with a view to layingless emphasis on the high levelof Unemployment and to avoiding the suggestion in the draft beforethe Cabinet that this is due exclu-sively to the prolonged industrialtroubles of 1926, as well as to bring into greater prominence the importanceof the Rating Scheme.(f) That the lPth paragraph should refer to the question of Agriculture insome such terms as the following:-&quot;I trust that the relief fromthe burden of rates affordedunder the. Scheme may benefitAgriculture and lead to a greater measure of employment in industry generally, and in particular inthose basic trades whose conditionstill causes concern&quot;.(NOTE:    The last three words,underlined, were substitutedin consequence of a suggestionreceived from Lord Stamfordham,who had drawn attention to theinconvenient alliteration inthe draft before the Cabinet.)(g) That the Lord Chancellor should considerthe substitution of some other term forthe words *most conspicuous&quot;, at theend of the 10th paragraph.(h)   That the Lord Chancellor should beasked to circulate a fresh draft tohis colleagues in time to secure theKing&apos;s signature at a meeting of the privy Council on Thursday, NovemberIs t.
REPARATIONSAM) allied debts.(previous reference:Cabinet 47(28), Con-clusion 4.)3. The Cabinet had before them the following memoranda by the Chancellor of the Exchequer:-An account of his conversations in Paris with M. Poincare andMr Parker Gilbert on October 19,1928 (Paper 0.P.-311 (28)):A specially secret Memorandumoovering a draft of the Notev/hich he proposes to send toM. Poincare&apos; in aocordanoe withan arrangement made in Paris onOctober 19th, and a diagram showinghow his proposals would &quot;work outon the basis of a German annuity of 100,000,000 (Paper CP.-317 (28)).The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinet that after his meeting in Paris withM, Poinc are&apos; he had sent a telegram to signor mussolini and had suggested that he should sendSignor Alberto Pirelli to London to discuss thequestion.   In reply he had received a telegram,which he read to the Cabinet and which wascouched in very cordial terms, conveying signor mussolini&apos;s acquiescence in the proposal asregards Signor Pirelli, who was due in London onThursday .The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed outthat the British policy was founded on the BalfourNote.   There was one point, however, on which hehad a slight reservation to make, namely, inregard to the arrears of  180,000,000 requiredto carry out in full the policy of the Note,Hitherto we had stood for the whole of thesearrears, but it must now be realised that therewas not the smallest chance of our recovering themin full, although we might obtain a part.   He was anxious, in the Note to M. Poincare&apos;, not to reverse the policy, but to indicate that therewas room for a little &quot;give&quot; on this question.
He asked the views of his colleagues on thispoint.   Mr churchill stated that there were certain points of detail upon which in any eventhe would want to alter the Note.In the course of the discussion it wassuggested to Mr Churchill that the reference tothe question of arrears should be made at the endof the second sub-paragraph on page 2 of paper cp.-317 (28), where it would be linked up withthe cost of repairing the devastated regions.It was suggested that the addition, after thewords &quot;devastated regions&quot;, might be in some such terms as the following:-&quot;and of extinguishing the accumulateddeficiency of  180,000,000 referredto above&quot;.The first four lines of the following paragraphmight then be omitted.Another suggestion was that the fourthsub-paragraph, on page 2, should be amended byreferring to the Expert Committee as an &quot;independent&apos;&apos;Expert Committee.   In this connection the cabinet were reminded that Lord Cushendun had committedthe country unconditionally to an expert invest!-gation,Mr Churchill wished at this stage to avoid the word &quot;Independent&quot;, but undertook instead to alter the words &quot;would be&quot;,  in the second line,to &quot;have been&quot;, so as to read:-&quot;On this understanding His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, for their part, have been willing to refer the question of thetotal annuities to be paid by Germany ,to an Expert Committee for examination&quot;,etc ,Another suggestion made in the course of thediscussion was that it was important that any
division of capital mobilised by the marketing of German Bonds should not be on different propor-tions from the arrangements agreed to at Spa asregards the division of the interest.   It wassuggested that at the end of paragraph 3 thefollowing words might be added:-&quot;and, if thought expedient, the rightof the Government to receive the annuities in accordance with the Spapercentages&quot;.Some discussion took place as to the bestprocedure to be adopted in order to communicate to other Interested Governments the present positionin regard to the proposed expert inquiry.    On theone hand it was recognised as desirable to avoidpresenting the German Government with a formalNote based on the draft Note to M. Poincare anddemanding their adherence thereto .    On the otherhand, the Governments of Berlin, Brussels and rome had all been made aware that Mr churchill and m. Poincare&apos; were about to exchange preciseNotes and consequently would expect some fullcommunication.    It was recognised to be necessaryto acquaint them fairly and fully with the position,lest otherwise the same sort of suspicions mightbe aroused as in the case of the Anglo-FrenchAgreement on Naval Disarmament, the gist of whichhad been communicated to certain foreign Govern-ments, but without, the text.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Chancellor of the exchequer should circulate a re-draft of the note to M. Poincare attached to paper.P.-317 (28), and that in the absenceof any criticism from any of hiscolleagues he should have authorityto despatch the Note without further discussion at the Cabinet:-S-
(b) That the form and method of thecomtrranications to be made to thevarious foreign Governments con-cerned should be left for arrange-ment between the Acting Secretaryof State for Foreign A-ffairs andthe Chancellor of the Exchequer.
CHINA.I Future BritishWGarrisons   in.(previous reference:Cabinet 41(28) , Con-conclusion 5. )if.   The Cabinet had before them the following documents relating to future garrisons in China:-A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for War (Paper CP.-278 (28))asking the Cabinet to approve inprinciple the fixing of the futureBritish garrisons in China at 5Battalions (in addition to theIndian Battalion) in order thathe might discuss with the treasury the details of the provision of accommodation for the two additionalBattalions to be located at Hong-Kong:A Mote by the Chancellor of theExchequer (Paper CP.-279 (28))covering a Memorandum by theTreasury opposing the Secretaryof State&apos;s proposal on the grounds,inter alia, that It amounts to aoonfession that our present army is too small;   that in view of the pressing need of economy the proposal could only be justified on grounds ofimperative urgency, which does not exist;   that the proposed garrisonwould be an over-insuranee;   thatin the present state of foreign relations there is no menace from japan; and that the proposal ispremature, no decision being required so long as an emergencyforce is retained in China:A rejoinder by the Secretary of Statefor War (Paper CP.-314 (20)) pointing out that, as explained in Papers beforethe Committee of Imperial Defence, theBritish Army is not really adequate for the task which is required of ittoday, although he accepts the inability of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto inorease it;   that he is only seeking to advise as to its best distribution;quoting&quot; the opinion of the ForeignOffice that China will be the dangerarea in international relations solong as civil war continues;   adducingrecent history to combat the argument&quot;that it is an over-insurance: eiiphasiz-ing the inadequacy of the presentgarrison of Hong-Kong;   and urging that the present proposal is notpre nature and that we must adopt adefinite policy which will admit of accommodation being ready in Hong-Kongagainst the time, not far distant,when we may hope to withdraw the lastBattalion from Shanghai.
In the course of the discussion theSecretary of State for &quot;far was asked as towhy,  if there were six Battalions in Chinabefore the wrar,  it was - now necessary to put upnew &quot;barracks in order to carry out his proposals.The Secretary of State for India warned theCabinet that, in the event of future trouble inChina,  it would not be safe to count on assistance from India, as trouble in one partof Asia was liable to produce reactionselsewhere in that Continent.Questions w,.re also asked as to what action,  if any, was being taken &quot;by the MunicipalCouncil at Shanghai to strengthen the-forcesmaintained locally, as so often urged upon them, and the Cabinet were informed that, althoughthe question had been studied at Shanghai,the Council had so far shrunk from the issue.The Cabinet agreed --he present time would requirereconsideration by whatever-Government might bejrffoff ice afterthe General ElecJ^on, and sincethe tendencyirfuhina is towardsgreater tranquillity,  it would beadvisahi^xo postpone a decisionunii^after the General Election&quot;5nat in the meanwhile the Committeeof Imperial Defence should keepthe question under carefulobservation, and report their recommendations in due course.
RATING REFORM.Freight relief on Gam Is and private Rail-ways.(previous reference:Cabinet 40(28), Con-elusion 1(b) and (f).Also Cabinet47 (28) , Con-clusion 10. )5.    The Cabinet had before them a Merriorandumby the Minister of Transport (Paper CP.-306 (28))raising for decision the question of whetherrailway freight relief should be anticipated in the case of canals and private mineralrailways, which had been left over for laternotconsideration when it was decided/to anticipatein the case of harbours and docks.    Afterreviewing in his Memorandum the pro&apos;s and oon&apos;sof the question, the Minister of Transportadvised that the preliminary scheme should be strictly limited to traffio carried by thepublic railways, and that the answer to otherclaimants should be that the Government regretsthat It cannot see its way to extend to the many special anticipation of the relief fromrating which will come into force on the 1st ofOctober, 1929.After explanations by the President ofthe Board of Trade,  the Cabinet agreed -(a) That the Minister of transport should have authority toinform claimants that theGovernment regrets  that itcannot see its way to extend to  chem.any special anticipation of the relief from rating whichwill come into force on the1st October,  1929;(b) That collieries owning privatemining lines      who    consider themselves entitled to reliefshould be encouraged to approach the Mining Associationwhose claims for relief fromthe oppressive burdens of rates on the public railways have been met so &quot;handsoinely by the Govern-ment, and who might possibly be able to make some arrangementsamong their members if they thought that the special circum-scancee of the collieries owningprivate lines justified some adjustment.
THE UNEMPLOYMENT        6. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by insurance BILL.the Minister of Labour (Paper CP.-312 (28)) in(Previous conneotion with the Unemployment Insurance Bill,Ref reference e:Cabinet 52 by means of which, it is proposed to increase the(27), Con-elusion 1. ) borrowing powers of the Unemployment Fund beyondthe present limit of  30.000,000 and up to a totalof  40,000,000.    The Memorandum dealt mainly withthe complicated question of the adjustment of therevenue and expenditure of the Unemployment fund and otntained the suggestion that the Bill shouldnot provide for any increase of contributions atthe moment but should include powers to do soshould it be subsequently found to be necessary.After some discussion,  the cabinet agreed -(a)  That in increasing to  if,000,000the borrowing powers of theUnemployment Fund, no attempt should be made at the presenttime to adjust the revenue andexpenditure of the Fund.      Itshould be pointed out to Parlia-ment that the insolvency of theFund is due to the strikes of1926, and that the Government donot feel entitled at the presenttime to inflict extra burdens inrespect of it.(The Minister of Labour asked thathis personal dissent from theviews of his colleagues on thispoint might be recorded.)f (b)    That the Minister of Labour should consider and discuss with theChancellor of the Exchequer aproposal made by Mr.  Churchill thatthe increase of the Fund to 40,000,000 should be limited to two years, and report to the next meeting of the Cabinet.
