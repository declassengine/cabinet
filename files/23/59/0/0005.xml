1. The Cabinet had before them the Report ofan Inter-Departmental Committee on Unemployment(Paper C.P.-325 (28)) which had been before them at their previous Meeting, together with theReport thereon of the Cabinet Committee appointedto consider it (Paper CP.-534 (28)) and a state-ment circulated by the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs reporting the latest developments in regard to Oversea Settlement (Paper CP.-336(28)) .The Report, of the Cabinet Committee recom-mended a policy in regard to Unemployment underthe following headsThe main contribution to assistUnemployment is the comprehensivemeasure of Rating Relief to agriculture and industry, which-comes into force after the ratepayments of April next, togetherwith further relief from thereduction of railway freights to agriculture, coal,and iron andsteel, which latter, under theproposals of the Government, will begin on the 1st December.The second main feature is thepolicy of Empire Settlement, whichis being greatly accelereted.The third feature is the policy oftransference of surplus labour fromthe depressed areas to areas ofbetter employment, the processbeing facilitated by the provisionof Training Centres.To facilitate the transfer policy the Committee proposes to reopenon more favourable terms the grantsoffered to Local Authorities throughthe St. Da^idfs Committee in respectof works financed out of&apos; loans inoases where Authorities in the moreprosperous areas are prepared to employ a substantial proportion ofpersons from the distressed areasupon public works.   The offer of improved terms will, as a rule,
EXPORT CREDITS.(previous reference:Cabinet 45(28), Con-clusion 1.)LAND DRAINAGE.(a) England andWales.(Pr previous reference:Cabinet 7(27), Con-clusion 1 and appendix.)(b) Scotland.be conditional on the LocalAuthority drawing not less than50 per cent. of the labour fromthe distressed areas, but the st. David&apos;s Committee will have discretion to allow a lowerpercentage in special oases.In accordance withalready announceddecision.   Bill willbe introduced in the House ofCommons at once to extend theExport Credits Scheme, whichwould have expired afterSeptember, 1929.An extension of the field ofLand Drainage and al3iad schemes(of which the Ministry of Agri-culture has a waiting list)assisted out of State funds withthe object of diverting unemployedminers and others to useful works of an urgent nature:    the Govern-ment grant in such cases to be50 per cent, of the approvedcost of the works.for Scotland a schere /simi1ar to that which wasin operation from 1921 to 1926,which included field, arterialand hill drainage, an improvementin farm water-supplies and theimprovement of privately-ownedfarir roads;    labour required to beobtained through the Labour Exchange,or, if obtained elsewhere, to be composed of at least 75 per cent.ex-Service men:  applicants to berequired to expend a sum at leastequal to the amount, of the grantoffered.electricity supply.(previous reference ererc e:Cabinet 8(26) , Con-clusion 15.)The rapid progress made in the lasttwo years under the electricity supply Act, of which particulars aregiven in the Committee&apos;s Report, isa substantial contribution towardscreating employment in the industriesaffected.In presenting the above proposals of policy the Cabinet Committee had reserved to the Cabinetthe recommendations of Sir Warren Fisher&apos;sInter-Departmental Committee&apos;s Report In respectof the extension of Forest Holdings
In the course of the discussion the Presidentof the Board of Trade drew attention to the follow-ing passage in the Report of the Cabinet Committee(Paper 0.P.-334 (28)):-&quot;There is no doubt that a low migrantpassage rate would be a greatencouragement to steady migration,as it was before the War.   Arran^e-ments will, it is hoped, shortly becompleted with the Shipping Companieson the No^th Atlantic Service bywhich they will be enabled to quotea, general reduced 5rd-Class fare to canada for British migrant a at  10.**Lord Lovat was able to ascertain fromthe Canadian authorities this summerthat such an arrangement would not beregarded as bringing the migrantsavailing themselves of these reducedfares within the category of assistedmigrants and subject to the liroxta-tions as to occupation or other restrictions imposed in connectionwith assisted passagesSir Philip Cunliffe-Lister asked any of hiscolleagues who were speaking on this subject inthe Debate to exercise great care to use the precise langiaage of the underlined portion of theabo&quot;&quot;-e extract from the Report, as the shipping companies concerned, having regard to their obligations to the Shipping Conference to Which-they belonged, could only reach agreement cn thebasis that the plan is not for a Biere lowering of fares but part of a scheme undertaken by theBritish Government.In connection with the passage quoted above,but immediately following the words underlined,the Secretary o^ State for Dominion Affairs said35NOTB.     In the Committee&apos;s Report it is mentioned that the figure of  10 should not be quoteduntil there is a firm agreement with theCompanies as to the terms on which thedifference is to be borne.
that the arrangements agreed between Lord Lovatand the Canadian authorities had not yet receivedformal confirmation.   He would have to obtainauthority from the Canadian Government before their acquiescence could be announced.   He proposedto send a telegram, the same morning on this point.Mr Amery also impressed on any of his colleagues who would be speakine in the Debate the importanceof avoiding the suggestion that migration was undertaken merely as a remedy for unemployment,which could only have the worst effect in Canada.In the course of the discussion it wassuggested that emphrsis might be laid on the factthat sove of the best material in the country hasbecome available &apos;or migration owing to the peculiar misfortunes of the coal industry.Emphasis was also laid in the course of the dis-cussion on the fact that much of the presentunemployment is the direct consequence of theGeneral Strike and Coal Strike of 1926.   In thisconnection the Minister o^ Labour undertook to circulate some figures in regard to the trade ofthe country generally,  apart from the distressedindustries.Comment was made that at a time when specialexpenditure is about to be incurred for the purposeof alleviating unemployment, the Treasury ispressing the Service Departments, on grounds of economy, not to spend the whole of the money already approved in the Estimates for accepted schemes,the carrying out of which would make new employment or secure the retention of men already in employment.
1 n o-A u  It was pointed out, however, that the proposalsof the Cabinet Committee were designed moreespecially to bring unemployed from the distressed areas to other areas, which was not the case withthe schemes of the Service Departments;    that if agood Budget was to be secured next year, economyinter-was essential;    and that the/national outlook was such as to encourage the hope that this might beachieved by the Service Departments.   The Chancellorof the Exchequer undertook, however, to confer withthe Secretary of State for Air if he had anyspecial suggestions to make in this connection.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To accept the Report of the Umemploy-ment Policy Committee (Paper C.I.-334(28)) (Appendix) as the basis of theGovernment&apos;s policy on unemployment to be announced in the House ofCommons during the forthcomingDebates on the Amendment to be moved by the Labour Party to the Address:(b) That on the question of Forest Holdingsthe Chancellor of the Exchequer, in thecourse of his speech, should state thatthe Government were carrying on thepolicy previously announced in regardto Forest Holdings, and that if oppor-tunities should arise for settling large families in forest holdings these cases would receive special consideration:(c) That the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs should send a telegram to the Canadian Government asking for confirmation of the arrangements&quot;madeby Lord Lovat with them, under whichthe reduction in the 3rd-Class farefor Eritish migrants would not beregarded as bringing the migrantsavailing themselves of these reducedfares within the category of assistedmigrants and subject to the limitationsas to occupation or other restrictions imposed in connection with assistedpassages.     Mr Amery should press theCanadian Government for an immediatereply:(d) Pending a reply from the canadian government,  the Government speakersin the Debate should refrain fromstating that the Canadian Governmenthad accepted these arrangements:
(e) That the President of the Boardof Trade, notwithstanding that the formal confirmation of these arrange-ments had not been received from theCanadian Government, should have authority to proceed with his negotia-tions with the Shipping Companies onthe North Atlantic Service for thereduction of the 3rd-Class fare to canada on the basis of those arrange-ments^^c-(f) That in the forthcoming Debates onthe Labour Party&apos;s UnemploymentAmendment to the Address,  the follow-ing Ministers should be prepared totalce part: -Thursday, November 8th.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, atthe outset of the Debate.Mr Herbert G.

1HTHE factories bill.(previous reference e:Cabinet 41(28),  Con-clusion 9.)2. In the oourse of the discussion referredto in the preceding Minute, reference was made tothe comment in Parliament on the omission from theKing&apos;s Speech of the Factories Bill.The Chancellor of the Exchequer undertook to reply to critics by pointing out that everyonewishes the Factories Bill to be carried.   At thepresent time, however, the conditions in ourfactories are better than in any other country inEurope, though our Industries are by no means asprosperous as similar industries in some othercountries.   It appeared to the Government to bemore important to pass the Rating Scheme in orderto revive industry as a first step to be carriedout  during the present Session, after which it willbe possible to make further improvements by introducing the Factories legislation.
BEAM WIRELESS 3. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum byAND CABLE g.c.m.g.-PANIES. the Secretary of State for the Colonies (Paper C.P.-(Previous 328 (28)) circulating for the consideration of theReferenc e:Cabinet 49 Cabinet, and in reference to the Imperial Telegraphs(28), Con-elusion 17.)       Bill, a Memorandum drawing attention to certainTHE WEST INDIAN   points arisins out of the sale of the West IndianCABLE AND WIRE-LESS SYSTEM. Cable and Wireless System to the Communications(Previous Company which is to be formed in accordance withReference:Cabinet 23 the Report of the Imperial Wireless and Cable(24),  Con-clusion 12.)       Conference.In this Memorandum Mr Amery recalled thefollowing conditions, which he had intended to insist on in connection with an offer in&apos;1927(but subsequently withdrawn) for the purchase of thwGovernment system by the Direct West India Company:-(a) A definite undertaking to continuethe services now performed by theGovernment system at rates not inexcess of the present rates for aperiod of, say, 2 5 years, withoutpayment of any subsidy.(b) A definite undertaking not totransfer the ownership or control ofany of their West Indian cables orwireless stations without the consentof the Government.(c) Cancellation of the objectionableclauses in the agreement of 1870between the Cuba Submarine company and the West India and PanamaCompany, and any connected orsubsidiary agreements.(d) An undertaking to avoid as far aspossible taking British West Indiantraffic through foreign territory or through stations or lines underforeign control.(e) An arrangement for taking over theCarriacou and Montserrat wireless stations at cost price, less any amount in the Sinking Fund, and fortheir operation as part of the system.( f) Substitution of landing licences fora term of, say, 25 years,  for thoselicences of the West India and PanamaCompany which contain no limit oftime and are claimed to be in perpetuity.
While Mr Amery hesitated to suggest that theseconditions should be definitely attached to thesale of the West Indian Telegraph System, he recommonded, in vier of the great desirability of safeguarding as far as possible the interests ofthese parts of the Empire, that it shotild be an instruction to the Advisory Committee, through which the Governments concerned are to exercise control over the Communications Company, to bear the above points in mind.The Cabinet did not feel justified in pursuing this subject in the absence of theSecretary of State for Scotland, who had beenChairman of the Imperial Wireless and Cable Confer-ence.   They asked the Secretary of State for theColonies to confer with the Secretary of State forScotland with a view to rendering joint adviceat a future Meeting of the Cabinet.
&apos;ejms OF WARAND BELLI-GBB^NT rights at SEA.(previous onsRefer enoe:Cabinet 46(28), Con-elusion 3.)4. The Cabinet had before them a Joint Memo-randum by the Acting Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs and the First Lord of the Admiralty (paper c.P.-309 (S8)), prepared in accordance with theConclusion referred to in the margin, in regardto the extent to which the American Navy co-operated with the British Navy during the Great War inexercising the rights of search and blockade, inwhich the conclusion was reached that the american naval Forces did not act on any occasion in a manner contrary to the policy expressed by theUnited States Government on belligerent rightsprior to their entry into the War .The Cabinet took note of the above memorandum .
1 HQREPARATIONS 5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum and allied debts. by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Paper C.P.-326(28)) covering a translation of a statement from(previous reference: M. Poincare&quot; transmitted to the Chancellor of theCabinet 48(28), Con- Exchequer by the French Ambassador in London onelusion 3,)October 30th?    a translation of a statement leftat the Foreign Office by the German Charge&apos;d*Affaire sin London on October 30th;    and a revised draftof the Note to M. Poincare in which certain modifica-tions in the earlier draft had been introduced inconsequence of the receipt of the above documents.The Chancellor of the Exchequer gave afavourable account of his interview with the Italianrepresentative on Reparations, and at his request the Acting Secretary of State for Foreign affairs read a message he had received from M. Poincare&apos;which included a statement to the effect thatMr Parker Gilbert did not now desire to be used as the channel of communication for informing theGerman Government of the views of the British andFrench Governments, and that in these circumstancesM. Poincare thought it would be advisable for theBritish and French Governments to communicate tothe German Government the messages they had inter-change d.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he wouldlike to have a few days to think over this question,which appeared feasible, owing to the Governmentcrisis in France, and he would advise the Cabineton the subject at an early date..

CRET.334  (28).APPENDIX.C A B I Tl ST.&quot;UNEMPLOYMENT POLICY COMMTTSB.REPORT .(1),      At their Meeting on November 5th, 1928,(Cabinet 49 (28), Conclusion 4), the Cabinet had beforethem the Report of an Inter-Departmental Committee underthe Chairmanship of Sir Warren Fisher containing recommen-dations for dealing with unemployment (CP. 325 (28)) and agreed -That a Cabinet Committee,  composed as follovvs -The Chancellor of the Exchequer (In the Chair).The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs and the Colonies,The Secretary of State for War,The Secretary of State for Scotland,The President of the Board of Trade,The Minister of Health,The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries,The President of the Board of Education,The Minister of Labour,should meet to consider the proposals in cp. 325 (28) and to report to the Cabineton the fallowing Wednesday their recommendations as to what announcement should be made In theforthcoming Parliamentary Debates on thesubject of unemployment.
noI.    Derating and Anticipation cf railway freight relief.2. The main contribution of the Government to assisttrade and employment is the comprehensive measure of ratingrolief to agriculture and industry which after the ratepayments of April next, relieve productive Industry of three-quarters, and agriculture of all rates at a oost to theNational Exchequer of some  35 millions a year.     In addition there is the further relief by the reduction of railway freightsto agriculture, coal and iron and steel.     The rating relief, whichthe Railways will pass on to their customers, as already announced,will be concentrated in helping those industries where the need is greatest.    And in selecting the particular traffios of concern to these industries, the relief is being concentrated where theindustries themselves consider the greatest benefit will beobtained.     Although the railway freight relief forms part ofthe general scheme, the Government decided that, in order togive immediate assistance to agriculture, coal, and iron andsteel, this railway freight relief should be anticipated.A vote will be submitted to Parliament at an early date enablingrailway freight relief to begin on the 1st of December.    It Isestimated that this relief will throw an additional charge on theBudget of this year of nearly  1,000,000 and of  2,250,000 onnext year&apos;s Budget.     This relief will allow for a reductionof 10$ on the selected traffics of agriculture and iron andsteel; and, In view of the concentration of the coal freightrelief in accordance with the desire of the mining industry itself on coal for export, foreign bunkers, blast furnaces andsteel works, the roduction on these selected coal traffioswill be equivalent to something like 30^*
IllII.     Empire Settlement.The second main feature is the policy of empire Settlement.     The Industrial TransferenceBoard emphasised the importance of stimulating thenormal flow of migration to Canada.    In August lastH.M. Government agreed to accelerate and extend thepolicy Ftf Empire Settlement at an estimated additional cost of  -g- million in this year rising to  l-J millions in future years.     There is no doubt that a lowmigrant passage rate would be a great encouragement tasteady migration as it was before the war.     arrangements will it is h^ped shortly be completed with the shipping companies on the Horth Atlantic Service by which theywill be enabled to quote a general reducedSrd Class fareto Canada for British migrants at    10*.     Lord Lovatwas able to ascertain from the Canadian authorities -this summer that such an arrangement would not be regardedas bringing the migrants availing themselves of thesereduced fares within the category of assisted migrants andsubject to the limitations as to occupation or other restrictions imposed in connection with assisted passages.Apart from these steps which are being takento stimulate the general flow of migration, the existing facilities for training and testing migrants who wish totake up work on the land overseas are being expanded bythe enlargement and fuller utilisation of existingtraining centres and the provision of new training centresThese facilities will be sufficient to send to Canadaduring the period of migration next year up to sixthousand men qualified and in a position to avail them-selves of the opportunities which Canada affords to men* (In speaking it would be better not to quote thefigure of  10, until there is a firm agreement withthe Companies as to the terms on which the difference is to be borne).
who are willing to go on the land, whose willingnesshas been tested by actual work on the land, and ito,not skilled agriculturalists, have at any rate anelementary knowledge of the tasks expected of them.
111&apos;    The Policy of gxffoefaniiao inrelation to &apos;^hV tmemploymenF&quot;GrantgCommittee.The most serious feature of the unemployment problem is the concentration in the depressed areas of large numbers ofpersons who are permanently surplus to the requirement of theirindustry.      There is no ground for hoping that if theae -people remain where they are they will ever again obtainemployment.     Various remedies have been suggested which mayin time bring some relief or improvement to the industries inwhich they have been engaged, but they will bring no immediatehelp to the surplus population.     The Industrial TransferenceBoard, after considering the problem exhaustively oame to theconclusion that the only thing to be done for this surpluspopulation was to induce it to move elsewhere, and bring it back into the stream of living industry.     The Government adopted thispolicy and in pursuance of It the Ministry of Labour aro movingmen and women and boys and girls from the desolation of the six ordepressed areas to work elsewhere at the rate of/seven hundreda week.      The process of transfer is being- intilltated by theprovision of training centres where men unused to factory lifecan be fitted for new trades.     These centres have already beenexpanded for the benefit primarily of men from the depressed areas.    If the present rate of transfer can be continued, it means that in six months something like 15,000 persons willhave been transferred from the depressed areas through themachinery of the Ministry of labour.   The will to move has been to some extent aroused, and it is probable that at least as many men and women in addition are moving on their own account.The policy, If it is to succeed, must have the goodwill and co-operation of all classes of the community.    It is not aquestion of asking for charity, or of asking employers to take on men whom they do not need.    All that Is asked is that of the5.
1 Ularge number of labour engagements which are made every week a relatively small proportion shall be given to those men,who include, as the Industrial Transference Board pointed out,some of the cream of the industrial population.In order to facilitate and-further the TransferenceSoheme, it is proposed to reopen on more favourable terms the grants offered to Local Authorities through the St. David^sCommittee in respect of works financed out of loans in caseswhere Authorities in the more prosperous areas are preparedto employ a substantial proportion of persons from the distressed areas upon public works.The offer of the improved terms will as a rulebe conditional on the local authority drawing not less than50 per oent of the labour from the distressed areas, but the sir. ]?avid&apos;s Committee will have discretion to allow a lowerpercentage in special cases.    The existing conditions requiringa minimum acceleration of 5 years and excluding  road works will be waived in order to. secure the maximum response.Although the object cf the scheme is to encourage the transfer of labour it is not proposed to disturb thepresent arrangements under which grants are now being paid in areas with exceptional unemployment*
IV.    EXPORT CREDITS.In order to stimulate export trade, the originalExport Credits scheme was introduced in 1920.     The termsunder which this scheme is operated have been altered fromtime to time, in order to make them of more practicalconvenience to manufacturers and exporters.     Under existing legislation no new guarantees could have been given afterSeptember of next year, and uncertainty as to whether thescheme would be continued would undoubtedly have deterredfirms from undertaking business with that assistance in thecoming year.     The Government have already announced their intention of continuing this help to our export trade fora further period of two years, and a Bill continuing thescheme will be introduced in the House of Commons at once.V.    LAND DRAINAGE.(A) ENGLAND AND WALES.By an extension of the field of Land Drainage and allied schemes assisted out of state  funds it would be practicable to divert a number of unemployed miners andethers to useful works of an urgent nature.The Ministry of Agriculture has a waiting list ofsuch schemes - including those which are known as the&quot;calamity&quot; cases in Essex which arose as the result of abnormal tides in January 1928.To do this would Involve some relaxation of conditionswhich govern grants under the existing programme of theMinistry.The Government grant in such cases should be 50 percent, of approved cost of the works.The necessary funds might be provided by releasing asum not exceeding  100,000 out of the balance of  580,COOwhich remains at present earmarked for the O^se Scheme outof the original  1,000,000 provided for drainage works asfrom April 1926.
1 I b(B)    SCOTLAND.From 1921 to 1926 the Board of Agriculture forScotland administered a scheme for the relief of unemploy-ment in districts where serious unemployment existed.     Theworks eligible for grant included field, arterial and hilldrainage, the provision and improvement of farm water-supplies, and the improvement of privately owned farmroads.      Labour required to be obtained through the LabourExchange, or If obtained elsewhere had to be composed tothe extent of at least 75% of ex-service men.During that period the amount of grant paid by theBoard was  124,270 and the number of unemployed men engaged on schemes was about 13,000.The Board now propose that a scheme similar to thatwhich was in operation from 1921-1926 should be authorised.The Board report that the scheme could be put Intooperation at once and would not entail the employment ofadditional staff to administer it.      Further,  and inaddition to the relief of unemployment which it would affordin both urban and rural areas,  It weuld be attractive toagriculturists generally, while State expenditure would be safeguarded in that an applicant would be required to expend a sum at least equal to the amount of the grantoffered to him.The Board anticipate that about  100,000 would be spent under the scheme,  50,000 being Exchequer Grant andthat about r&apos;,b% of this sum would be spent on wages mostlyto unemployed persons.
VI.      Electricity Supply.The Committee have received from the Ministerof Transport the following statement of the progress made with schemes under the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1926:-The Table appended to this Report shows the progress made with Schemes under the Act.It will be seen that four Schemes have alreadybeen adopted by the Board covering the areas of central Scotland, South-East England, CentralEngland, and North-West and North Yfales.    these four Schemes cover an area of over 30,000 square miles and a population of 27,000,000 people.    Thetotal capital expenditure estimated t^ be Involvedon transmission lines and transforming stations is nearly  17,000,000.Contracts have already been entered into by theCentral Electricity Board to the following amounts:-Central Scotland...............    1,095,170South-Bast England......*......     1,614,672North-West and North Wales..... 48,337TOTAL____     2,758,179In addition, expenditure has actually been incurred or approved in connection with thestandardisation of frequency amounting to nearly 200,000.It will be seen that rapid progress has beenmade in the last two years.    The placing of contracts,-      to which reference has just been made, is a substantial contribution towards creating employment in theindustries affected.
711.      FOHEST HOLDINGS.2he Linister of Labour, supported by the Ministerof Health, urged the acceptance of the recorantjidationof the Jishex Committee&apos;s I;epert in respect of t heextension of Forest Holdings.     Mr. chamberlain pointedout that this proposal was valuable as making specific provision for married men.     No decision was reached and the matter is referred to the Gabinet.The Committee approved all the above schemes(with the exception of that dealing with jrerest Holdingswhich was reserved for further consideration by theCabinet) and rejected all other proposals at the present time.       They decided that no particularpublic work should be specified and that no definiteestimate should be given of the amount of employmentforthcoming   from the application of these various measures.Signed on behalf of the CommitteeWINSTON S.
