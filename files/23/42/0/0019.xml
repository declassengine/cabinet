President Wilson&apos;visit:Statement by thePrime Minister.1. Mr. Lloyd George reported the substance of the conversations which he and Mr. Balfour had had with President Wilson. Nonotes or proces-verbal had been kept, and there had been no attemptto arrive at anything in the nature of an agreement. There hadsimply been an informal interchange of views in order to find out what the relative positions of the two parties were.The President had opened at once with the question of the League^of Nations and had given the impression that that was the only thing that he really cared much about. There was nothing in what he said which would in the least rmike it difficult for us to come tosome arrangement with him. His mind was apparently travelling in very much the direction of the proposals advocated by Lord robert cecil and General Smuts. He had no definite formal scheme in his mind, and was certaiidy not contemplating anyf hing in the nature ofgiving executive powers to the League of Nations. The question ofGermanys inclusion had not been raised, but was not apparentlycontemplated by him as a matter for the immediate future. what he was anxious about was that the League of Nations should be thefirst subject discussed at the Peace Conference. Both Mr. LloydGeorge and Mr. Balfour were inclined to agree, &apos;on the ground thatthis would ease other matters, such as the questions of the &quot; Freedomof the Seas,&quot; the disposal of the German colonies, economic issues, &amp;c.The President, having attained his object, could then say that thesematters could be left to be worked out by the League of Nations.There was also the consideration that the President might have togo back to America before the Conference concluded, and would wish to be able to say that he had achieved his purpose of creatingthe League of Nations.Lord Curzon added that the ^President had, on another occasion,given to him as a reason for beginning with the League of Nations,that the question of giving a mandate to certain Powers in certainterritories could not be settled unless there was a League of nations to give it.Mr. Lloyd George said that, as regards the Freedom of the Seas,the President was very vague. He did not oppose his suggestionthat the matter could be left for further consideration after the Leagueof Nations had been established and proved its capacity in actualworking. The impression he gave was that he might not resist that proposal, provided the League of Nations had been actually agreedto before the question of the Freedom of the Seas was raised.As regards disarmament, the President had urged that a definite decision should be arrived at before the Conference separated, and before the League of Nations was actually constituted. He admitted,however, that the intricate problems involved in relative disarmamentall round could not be settled during the Conference. Eventuallythey agreed that the Conference should not separate before a definiteprovisional limitation of armaments had been imposed on Germanyand her allies, a limitation which would enable them to maintainorder in the troubled conditions of their territories but no more.Subsequently, Germany might raise at the League of Nations thequestion of revising this provisional limitation. They felt, that if theGerman army was limited France would have to follow suit, and thatshe could hardly maintain an immense army under those conditions.In discussing this matter they had not overlooked the question of reserves and system of training, and he himself had reminded thePresident of what Prussia had done when her forces were limited to a fixed figure by Napoleon. He had suggested that Germany should notbe allowed to impose conscription in any shape or form until she hadentirely failed by voluntary means to raise the army provisionallyassigned tb her, after which she might be allowed to make good the deficit by ballot. In answer to a question by Sir J. Cook, Mr.Lloyd George said that what he contemplated would prevent Ger-many from enforcing even the compulsory training of the young,such as they had in Australia.
3     .IWC 47Lord Robert Cecil raised the question of whether conscriptionwas to be forbidden to the friendly new States created in the terri-tories of Austria-Hungary, eg., the Czechs and the Jugo-Slavs. Hewas inclined, with regard to them, to bold General Smuts&apos; view,viz., that they should not be allowed to buil I up large armies.Mr. Lloyd George concurred and considered that this was oneof the questions which the Chief of the Imperial General Staff might consider.The Imperial War Cabinet instructed-The Chief of the Imperial General Staff to make a provisionalrecommendation as to the strength to which the militaryforces of the various enemy countries should be limited,taking into consideration the need for maintaining internal order : and as to the manner in which they should be raised.The Imperial War Cabinet similarly instructed The Deputy First Sea Lord, in the light of the same considera-tions, to revise the estimate which the Board of admiralty had already made with regard to the strength to which theenemy fleets should be reduced.Reports on the above subjects to be available early next week.With regard to Russia, Mr. Lloyd George explained that president Wilson, though not pro-Bolshevik, was very much opposedto armed intervention. He disliked the Archangel and Murmanskexpeditions and would, no doubt, withdraw his troops from there.He was not very much in favour of the Siberian expedition, thoughas regards that his principal anxiety was as to the conduct of theJapanese, who were apparently taking the whole of Eastern Siberiainto their own hands, sending sealed waggons into the interior, and generally behaving as if they owned the country. His whole atti-tude, in fact, was strongly anti-Japanese.Lord Robert Cecil reminded the Imperial War Cabinet that theJapanese had just informed us that they were removing 30,000 outof the 60,000 Japanese troops now in Siberia.With regard to the Western frontiers of Russia, Mr. LloydGeorge said that they had discussed the question, but had come to,no sort of conclusion, as they felt the information was too defective.It was not clear, for instance, how far the so-called invasion ofEsthonia or Poland was a direct invasion by Bolshevik forces from outside, or an internal Bolshevik rising in those countries. ThePresident had not shown any keenness on the idea that russia should be represented at the Conference. On the other hand he had suggested that we should ask M. Litvinoff formally and definitelywhat his proposals were. Mr. Lloyd George suggested that it mightbe possible to take more formal steps to ascertain exactly what theBolshevik Government were prepared to do.A short discussion followed with regard to the informal negotia-tions which had already taken place, arising out of the telegram fromM. Litvinoff, transmitted by Mr. Clive (Stockholm, No. 3759, dated24/12/18). It was pointed out by Lord Robert Cecil that we couldnot definitely act on President Wilsons suggestion without communi-cating with our Allies, some of whom took a very strong line againstthe Bolsheviks. We ourselves had, in fact, asked our Allies andsome neutral Powers to keep out the Bolsheviks. The discussion onthis question, however, was postponed pending the production of.M. Litvinoffs answer to our request for definite proposals.With regard to the Near East, Mr. Lloyd George informed theImperial War Cabinet that President Wilson expressed himself infavour of the Turks being cleared out of Europe altogether, and oftheir place at Constantinople being taken by some small Poweracting as a mandatory of the League of Nations. Mr. Balfourhad told the President that the Eastern Committee had been in
favour of the United States acting as mandatory.at Constantinople.With regard to this, President Wilson had pointed out that theUnited States were extremely proud-of their disinterested position inthis war and did not wish to be deprived of that pride. It wouldbe difficult to persuade them that such a mandate was not a profit,but really a burden. Altogether, he bad shown himself very muchopposed to any intervention on the part of the United States in theseterritorial questions. To this Mr. Lloyd George and Mr. Balfour had replied by asking the question who was to undertake the burden of&quot;finding the two divisions, or whatever troops might be required, toprevent the Armenians from being massacred. The President hadnot given a definite answer but had certainly not yet reached thepoint of accepting the argument.Lord Curzon said that he had put the same point to thePresident himself, and that the President had replied asking that weshould lead him a little more slowly up to his fences ; that, if theLeague of Nations were once constituted and the Conference hadbeen sitting some time, the United States might possibly be lessreluctant to consider the question of mandatory intervention. Asregards Constantinople, he reminded the Imperial War Cabinet thatthe Eastern Committee had only discussed the suggestion, and hadnot actually recommended that it should be entrusted to the UnitedStates.Mr Lloyd George said that personally he considered itdangerous to give Constantinople and the Dardanelles to the UnitedStates. The suggestion had been made by Mr. Balfour; his ownsuggestion had been made with regard to Armenia. He had not suggested the possibility of an American mandate for eitherPalestine, Mesopotamia, or East Africa, the first two of which had never in fact been referred to in their discussions.As regards the German colonies, the President agreed that theycould not be i eturned to Germany, and that they should be put under some Power ai ting as a mandatory. Mr. Lloyd George had impressed,upon him the distinction between the German colonies conquered bythe British Dominions and adjacent to them, and those in the conquestof which the forces of the Empire as a whole had shared. He had expressed our willingness to leave German East Africa at the disposalof the League of Nations, and to accept all the conditions imposed by the League if we were entrusted with a mandate for its adminis-tration. In the other category he had put German South-West africa as the strongest case, pointing out that it would be &quot;quite impossible to separate from the South African Union what was essentially part ofthe same country. The President did not seem prepared to contestthat contention, but of his own accord retorted that the position ofAustralia with regard.to the Pacific colonies was not quite the same.Mr. Lloyd George and Mr. Balfour had endeavoured to put the case as strongly as they could for Australia, on the grounds of security,but the President had answered that a case on similar grounds mightbe made for every other captured territory. In answer to the argument that we had definitely promised to Japan the islands in theNorthern Pacific, and that it would be impossible to deny to Australiaand New Zealand what was given to Japan, the President had shownthat he was by.no means prepared to accept the Japanese treaty, andwas doubtful whether Japan could be admitted there even in the capacity of a mandatory Power. They had not succeeded in movinghim from that position.Mr. Bonar Law, who was present at that part of the discussion,,said that President Wilson had remarked in that connection that he regarded it as his function to act as a buffer to prevent disagreeablethings, such as the Japanese retention of the islands, being carriedout.Lord Curzon suggested that President Wilson ought not to be-regarded as a sole arbiter in these matters ; he would be only one--of a party round the Conference Table.
Mr. Llovd George agreed. He was only reporting the Presidentsviews, and had in no sense accepted them as final. With regard tothe Colonies, he had left the matter by telling the President thatthe question would have to be fought out at the Conference, wherethe Dominions would be able to present their own case.With regard to indemnity, Mr. Lloyd George reported that he found the President, on the whole, stiffer than on any other question.The utmost concession he seemed inclined to make was that theclaims for pure reparation should be tabled first, and that then other claims might possibly be considered afterwards. Mr. Lloyd Georgehad pointed out that that practically ruled the British Empire outin spite of the enormous burdens it had borne, and that France andBelgium, who had borne a lesser burden, would practically geteverything. He had pointed out also that as a matter of fact ourown burden of over 6,000,000,0001 to a population of 45,000,000 was much heavier than that of Germany with a similar debt distributedover. 05,000,000 of people. Similarly, he had pointed out that australia at this moment owed 751. for every man, woman, and child of her population, a loss which was just as real as any lossrepresented by destroyed houses. He had, however, failed to makeany impression upon the President.In answer to a question by Mr. Hughes, Mr. Lloyd George saidthat with regard to the question of economic barriers, raised inNo. 3 of the President^ Fourteen Points, the President had show no inclination to raise the matter. His opinion was that PresidentWilson meant nothing particular by that Article anyhow, and since he had brought it forward he had lost the election in the UnitedStates.With regard to Italy, Mr. Lloyd George reported that he foundPresident Wilson distinctly anti-Ii alian, as the consequence of the conversations he had had with Baron Sonnino. He and Mr. Balfourhad tried to do their best to state Baron Sonnino&apos;s case with regardto the strategical position of the Dalmatian coast, but the Presidentsonly suggestion was that the Power to whom the Dalmatian coastwas given should be forbidden to have a navy at all.Mr. Hughes said that, in other words, the President held theview that those Powers which had ports.should have no fleets, andthat only those Powers which had no ports should be allowed tohave them.Mr. Lloyd George said that in any case it was clear that thePresident would strongly support the Jugo-Slavs against Italy.With regard to France, he did not think the President was prepared to tolerate schemes for the control of the west bank of the rhine, though he might be prepared to accept the French annexationof the Saar Valley.With regard to the proposed Inter-Allied Conference, they had found the President entirely opposed to holding such a Conference,at any rate formally. He considered that the general Peace Con-ference would be a sham if definite conclusions were simply arrivedat beforehand and then presented to Germany. He was quite prepared to hold inter-Allied discussions in Paris between the four powers informally, and agreed that definite decisions would have tobe arrived at there and presented to Germany at the Peace Con-ference. It really came to the same thing, but the Presidentinsisted definitely on his point of view.Lord Curzon suggested that, unless the President got beyondthe very loose talk he had had with members of the British Govern-ment in this country, the Peace Conference would be a dreary fiasco.In any case, France had a very different conception of what was tobe done, as was shown by the French proposals for the representationof the smaller Allies at the Inter-Allied Conference.With regard to the language to be used at the Peace Con-Terence, Mr. Lloyd George mentioned that the President proposed to[530-25] C
insist that English and French should both be the official languages,and that the reports of the Conference should be published in bothlanguages.Lord Robert Cecil undertook to communicate with our repre-sentatives abroad, with a view to their supporting colonel house&apos;s attitude in this matter.With regard to the question of publicity, Mr. Lloyd Georgementioned that President Wilson had been in favour of allowing the papers to publish what they liked, and to impose norestrictions.Mr. Hughes said that if we were not very careful, we should find ourselves dragged quite unnecessarily behind the wheels of president Wilson&apos;s chariot. He readily acknowledged the part which America had played in the war. But it was not such as toentitle President Wilson to be the god in the machine at the peace settlement, and to lay down the terms on which the world wouldhave to live in the future. The United States had made no moneysacrifice at all. They had not even exhausted the profits which theyhad made in the first two and a half years of the war. In men,their sacrifices were not even equal to those of Australia. Relativelytheir sacrifices had been nothing like as much as those of Australia.America had neither given the material nor the moral help whichentitled her to-come before France. If M. Clemenceau took the line which President Wilson seemed to be taking, he (Mr. Hughes)might be prepared to say, &quot; You have a right to speak.&quot; He hopedthat Great Britain and France, which had both sacrificed so much,would defend their own interests and not let their future be decidedfor them by one who had no claim to speak even for his own country.Mr. Lloyd George had received an overwhelming vote from his fellow-countrymen, not only in recognition of what he had done but because of their confidence that he would see to it that theirsacrifices had not been made in vain. In taking up that line at thePeace Conference, Mr. Lloyd George would have not only all England,but more than half America behind him. He and M. Clemenceaucould settle the peace of the world as they liked. They could giveAmerica the respect due to a great nation which had entered the warsomewhat late, but had rendered great service. It was intolerable,however, for President Wilson to dictate to us how the world wasto be governed. If the saving of civilisation had depended on theUnited States, it would have been in tears and chains to-day. Asregards the League of Nations, Mr. Hughes considered that a Leagueof Nations which was to endure and weather the storms of time would have to be a thing like the British Empire, framed, in accor-dance with historical associations and practical needs. PresidentWilson, however, had no practical scheme at all, and no. proposals that would bear the test of experience. The League of nations was to him what a toy was to a child-he would not be happy till hegot it. His one idea was to go back to America and say that he had achieved it, and that everything else could then be left for the Leagueof Nations to complete. He (Mr. Hughes) did not consider that thepeace of the world could be settled on the terms of &quot; Leave it all tothe schedule.&quot; Speaking for&apos; Australia, he wanted to know whatAustralia was to get for the sacrifices she had made. When he had secured what he wanted, the Freedom of the Seas, as we knew it andmeant to have it, and necessary guarantees for the security anddevelopment of the Empire and reparation and indemnities, then hewould have no objection to handing over other matters to a Leagueof Nations. Such a League must, however, be properly constituted,.and one in which the British Empire occupied a place corresponding to its sacrifices in the war and. its position in the world. Heinsisted that in any case we should not commit ourselves to theLeague of Nations until the Conference had completed its labours.
To start with a League of Nations and then continually refereverything to this League would mean-giving up the substance forthe shadow. The League of Nations should be the gilded ball onthe dome of the cathedral, and not the foundation-stone.As regards the German colonies in the Pacific, he thoughtthat President Wilson was talking of a problem which he didnot really understand. New Guinea was only 80 miles from australia. In any case, whatever else the people of Australiadiffered on, they were united on two things : firstly their attitudetowrards Japan and the White Australia policy ; and secondly, theretention of these islands. He asked above all things that thePrime Minster wdio now stood clothed with all power by the recentvote of the people, should resolutely insist upon such terms of peaceas were necessary for the safety of the Empire, through whosesacrifices and efforts victory had been won.Mr. Chamberlain suggested that it might be made clear to president Wilson that there should be a British Monroe doctrine forthe Southern Pacific.Lord Curzon considered that Mr. Hughes&apos;s views were shared by many members of the Imperial War Cabinet. More particularlyhe thought it was felt that Mr. Lloyd George should remember thepower he possessed not merely in virtue of the recent election, but of all the sacrifices made by the British Empire, and of the interests which it had at stake all over the world. While holding the opinionthat the future fortunes of the world must largely depend onco-operation between England and America, he did feel that ifPresident Wilson persisted in the line reported it might benecessary, on some issues at any rate, for Mr. Lloyd George to work at the Conference in alliance with M. Clemenceau.Mr. Long agreed cordially with the views expressed by lord curzon, adding that he did not think that President Wilson realisedwhat the conquest of German East Africa had meant, or the extentto which every part of the British Empire had been involved in it.Lord Beading thought that it would be lamentable if the resultof the friendly discussions which had taken place was to convey theimpression that President Wilson and Mr. Lloyd George wereacutely divided. He fully agreed that we could not give up our claims on any matter without fighting, but he did hope thatwe should not lightly abandon the position that, consistently withthe maintenance of our rights, our main object was to bring aboutthe closest co-operation hereafter between ourselves and the UnitedStates.Lord Curzon explained that he placed as much reliance on thefuture co-operation of Great Britain and the United States as anymember of the Imperial War Cabinet. All he had meant to implywas that at the Conference Mr. Lloyd George woull go with an authority fully equal, and indeed superior, to that of PresidentWilson.Mr. Churchill considered that the only point of substance wasto induce the United States to let us off the debt we had contractedwith them, and return us the bullion and scrip we had paid over, onthe understanding that we should do the same to the Allies to whom we had made advances. If President Wilson were prepared to do that, we might go some way towards meeting his views in the matterof indemnity. For the rest, we should be civil and insist on our essential points.Sir Robert Borden said that he would regret if we entered onthe Peace Conference with any feeling of antagonism towardsPresident Wilson or the United States. He considered that therecent conversations had, on the whole, been as favourable as he had anticipated. Future good relations between ourselves and theUnited States were, as he had said before, the best asset we could bring home from the war. With regard to the two points on which there had[530-25] D
J.8been a pronounced^ difference, namely the Pacific Islands andindemnity, there was no reason to conclude that we had yet got the presidents final point of view. He agreed that with regard tothese we should maintain our position strongly. . He wished,however, to make clear that if the future policy of the BritishEmpire meant working in co-operation with some European nation as against the United States, that policy could not reckon on theapproval or the support of Canada. Canada&apos;s view was that as an empire we should keep clear, as far as possible, of European com-plications and alliances. This feeling had been immensely strength-ened by the experience of the war, into which we had been drawn by old-standing pledges and more recent understandings, ofwhich the Dominions had not even been aware. He was in no sense reproaching the Imperial Government with regard to thepast, and admitted in answer to a question by Mr. Lloyd George that since the Imperial War Cabinet had been set up the dominions had not been committed to any treaty binding upon them without their knowledge.With regard to Russia, he did not see how the war could beregarded as terminated if we left the Peace Conference with five or six nations and Governments still fighting in Russia. There were only two alternatives: one was to go and forcibly intervene inRussia itself; the other, which he preferred, was to induce theGovernments of the various States in Russia to send representatives to Paris for conference with the Allied and associate nations. these could then bring pressure, if necessary, upon them to restrain andcontrol aggression, and to bring about conditions of stable govern-ment under the power and influeuce of the League of Nations.Lord Robert Cecil expressed his agreement with Sir robert borden&apos;s suggestion concerning Russia. He admitted that therewere certain difficulties in dealing with the Bolshevik Government,but thought they were not insuperable. He suggested that all parties in Russia should be told to stand fast where th^y were till the Peace Conference was over, and that meanwhile AlliedCommissions might clear up many disputed points in the situation.Lord Milner suggested that, if Lord Robert Cecil&apos;s proposal were accepted, there was no reason why all the Governments inRussia, including even the Bolsheviks, should not be invited to thePeace Conference. If the Bolsheviks really accepted the conditions and stopped their aggression upon their neighbours, they would, infact, have begun to cease being Bolsheviks.Mr. Lloyd George agreed, but pointed out that it would benecessary to stop aggression by General Denekin and the SiberianGovernment upon the Bolsheviks, and that measures might have tobe taken at the Peace Conference to prevent the Bolsheviks usingit for the purposes of propaganda.Lord Robert Cecil said that he agreed with Mr. Husrhes&apos;s viewthat the Empire would go into the Peace Conference in a position ofenormous power, which, however, was also a position of prodigiousresponsibility. The vital thing was to secure a settled peace. Thegreatest guarantee of that was a good understanding with theUnited States, and that good understanding could not be securedunless we were prepared to adhere to the idea of the League ofNations. He agreed that the details of the League of Nations couldnot be settled at the beginning of the Peace Conference, but thegeneral principles might be laid down as early as possible. His ownidea would be that the Peace Conference should at the outset pass,say, three resolutions, laying down : firstly the desirability of a league of Nations; secondly the general functions of such a league ; and thirdly the Powers which at present could be trustedto take part in it, the elaborating of these resolutions to be referredto a technical Commission, which could be working; at the matterwhile the Conference was sitting.    In answer to a question by Sir J.
9 IWC 47Cook, he agreed that indemnity and other main terms of peace wouldhave to be settled by the Peace Conference itself, and could not beleft to the League of Nations.(The discussion was adjourned to 11 a.m. on Tuesday, 31st December,1918.)SOPrisoners of War&quot;ShippingRequirements.2. The Imperial War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum(G.T.-6561) by Lord Cave, in which he asked that two or more german ships should be utilised for bringing back prisoners of war to this country. Lord Cave said that the matter was a very urgentone, as some of the prisoners would die unless they were brought back at the earliest possible moment.Mr. Graeme-Thomson said that the prisoners could be shippedin British vessels, but it would mean the retardation of there patriation of Dominion troops.Sir R. Eorden said that the Dominions had made definitearrangements with regard to repatriating their men, and it would benecessary to ascertain whether these arrangements could be delayed.Mr. Graeme Thomson pointed out the proposed arrangement would affect the repatriation of Australian and New Zealand troops,but not the Canadians, for the last named there was ample tonnage available.Lord Reading said that he had consulted the Admiralty on thissubject, and their point of view was that there were only sixGerman ships available, and that the French, to whom three ships had already been allotted, had a bigger claim to these ships owingto their great number of prisoners.The Imperial War Cabinet decided that-In view of the vital necessity of getting prisoners home,temporary priority of British shipping should be given tothis service, and that the Ministry of Shipping should takethe necessary steps in consultation with the representativesof the Dominions.Rolling-stockRequirements3. Lord Cave drew attention to the delay in getting prisoners from certain camps to the Baltic ports, owing to the shortageof rolling-stock. The German delegates at Spa had said that norolling-stock was available for- this purpose, and had suggestedthat part of the rolling-stock delivered to the Allies under the termsof the Armistice should be used. General Adye (who was watching the interests of the British prisoners at Spa) had recommended theadoption of this proposal.&apos;   The Imperial War Cabinet decided that Lord Cave should be authorised to require the British repre-sentatives at Spa to press for the sanction of the french to this proposal.Supply of food and Raw materials to France.4. The Imperial War Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby Lord Reading (G.T.-6536), with regard to a request from theFrench that they should be supplied with certain food and rawmaterials.Lord Reading said he proposed to reply to the French thattheir proposals would be sympathetically treated, but that every case would have to be considered on its merits, as our other Allieswere involved. .The Imperial War Cabinet approved of Lord Reading&apos;s proposed. reply.
6. The Imperial War Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby Sir R. Borden (G.T.-6486) in which he drew attention to thedesirability of removing or modifying restrictions on trade by administrative direction or otherwise.Mr. Long said that the Raw Materials Board was dealing withthis subject, and it had been unanimously decided to remove restric-tions at the earliest possible moment; trade within the Empire would,of course, receive the first consideration.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,December 31, 1918.5. The -Imperial War Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby Sir Et. Bordeu.(G.T.-6485), relating;to preference iu government contracts to products of the Empire and Sir R. Borden drew attentionto a resolution of the Colonial Conference, 1902, on this subject.Mr. Bonar Law said that the following letter had been sent bythe Treasury on the LOth March, 1917, to the Commission inter--nationale de Ravitaillement&quot; It is the policy of their Lordships to purchase from withinthe Empire rather than from neutral countries, subject to arrange-ment of the necessary finance and also of shipping, in all cases in which any of the Dominions are able to deliver the goodsrequired on as favourable conditions as can be obtained else-where.&quot;He proposed that the Treasury should again circularise theGovernment Buying Departments on the lines of the above letter, butintimating clearly the desire of the Government to give an effective-preference to the Dominions.The Imperial War Cabinet concurred in this proposal.Mr. Hughes said he would like to know how preference wouldbe given. In a letter to Mr. Bonar Law, the Prime Minister had said that preference would only he given on tea and coffee. Subse-quently Mr. Long had said something about sugar, but there hadbeen nothing stated definitely or officially.Mr. Bonar Law said that the Prime Minister had only mentionedtea and coffee as an illustration. He felt sure, however, that it wasthe Prime Ministers idea to give a preference on all articles on whichthere was now a duty; although for the moment, and in the absenceof the Prime Minister, he could not commit him to this view, andit must be subject to his concurrence. It would in any case benecessary to wait until the next Budget before legislation could beintroduced.
