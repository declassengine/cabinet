2Italian Desiderata. The Imperial War Cabinet had before them the following documents on the subject of Italian desiderata: Agreement between the Three Powers and Italy (Paper G.T.-365).Convention militaire (Paper G.T.-365a).Anglo-French-Italian Conference (Paper I.C.-19).Memorandum by the Foreign Office on &quot; The Question of italian Claims &quot; (Paper G.T.-6515).Mr. Balfour explained that the Italian claims fell under threeheads: firstly, the claims directly connected with Italy, i.e., in theTrentino and on the shores of the Adriatic, with regard to whkhItaly enjoyed specific rights as against both France and ourselvesby virtue of the 1915 Treaty; secondly, the indeterminate and inde-pendent claims which Italy could put forward, in accordance with article 9 of that Treaty, to a share equitably corresponding to thatsecured by either France or England in the break-up of theOttoman Empire, or in any scheme of zones of interest within thatEmpire; and, thirdly, her claims to territorial consideration in africa.As regards the first of these heads, the Treaty position was quite definite. We brought Italy into the War by certain promises of territory. Italy bad acted upon those promises, and her helphad made a great difference. She had delivered the goods, andwas entitled to the price. He agreed with what the Prime minister had recently said about this, that there must be a genuine attemptto fulfil our obligations. Modification would have to be left toother Powers, and we should be bound to support the Italians ifthey insisted on their claims, though we could do our best to dis-persuade them. Undoubtedly, however, Italy&apos;s claims could not bejustified to-day on the basis of nationality and self-determination.The answer Italy would give as regards the JS^ugo-Slav claims would, no doubt, be to this effect: &quot; There was no question ofWugo-Slavia in 1915. We were fighting Austria-Hungary, an empirewith a population of 55,000,000, and possessing a seaboardon the Adriatic of immense strategical strength, opposite to an italian seaboard incapable of offence or defence and without asingle port between Venice and Brindizi.&quot; Mr. Balfour con-sidered that the argument was a good one in 1915. Since then thewhole situation had changed. There was a strong case for modify-ing that view to-day, provided that Italy could be persuaded toagree. That did not, however, seean to be the Italian attitude atpresent. Even Fiume, which was not included in the Treaty of1915, was now being claimed as a purely Italian town, though atleast half the population of the city itself was Yugo-Slav.The same difficulty arose in the case of the Trentino. Therewas no difficulty in drawing an ethnographic frontier there. Butthe 1915 Treaty took the frontier up to the Brenner Pass, and in-cluded an unauestion^blv German population the very people who had fought heroically for the Hapsburgs against Napoleon in order to give Italy the crest of the Alps. A similar difficultyarose between Italy and the Greeks in the debatable countryclaimed as &quot; Southern Albania &quot; or &quot; Northern Epirus.&quot; Again,the Treaty of 1915 specifically gave to the Italians the dodecanese, a group of islands, entirely Greek in population,which the Italians had retained after the war with Turkey in1912, but which, on the principle of self-determination, ought togo to Greece.As regards the second category of Italian claims, Italy&apos;s atti-tude was based on the assumption that France was her future rival.Italian statesmen, looking at the population of France, which wasstationary at about 40,000,000, and at the increasing Italianpopulation of 38,000,000, considered that if Italy could get means
3IWC 45of expansion she had the right to become a great MediterraneanPower, or, indeed, as the heir of Pome, the predominant Mediter-ranean Power. He felt that nothing was more embarrassing thanthe fact that, after four years of alliance, the Italians and Prenchhated one- another more than before. Indeed, Italy was at this moment hated by everyone. Baron Sonnintfs diplomacy, based onthe Metternichian principle of keeping his hand on everything hecould get for the sake of subsequent bargaining, was making thingsdifficult for everybody. Mr. Balfour said he was afraid everymorning that he might read that a free fight had happenedbetween Italians and French or Italians and &quot;lugo-Slavs.As regards the African questions, he did not think Italy&apos;sambitions in that quarter would affect the Dominions, though their desire for an Abyssinian Protectorate, and an enlargement of the frontiers of Tripoli, &amp;o, would affect the Colonial Office.   *Mr. Long thought that a rectification. of frontiers in thoseregions might be possible. The real difficulty lay in the italian attitude over the arms traffic. To get an effective co-operationbetween the Great Powers was the. first condition of making any advance in dealing with the arms traffic and with the liquor traffic.   In both these respects the Italians were a great nuisance.Mr. Balfour added that this was equally true of the French,who maintained Jibuti simply for the sake of smuggling arms intothe interior of Africa. He regarded the question as a very alarm-ing one, in view of the number of rifles which would be releasedat the end of the War.Mr. Churchill suggested that in one sense the problem hadbeen simplified by the great development of aviation, which put anew and most effective weapon into the hands of the scientifically-organised Powers.Sir Robert Borden and Lord Curzon both referred to theForeign Office Memorandum, which pointed out that, while we hadno intention of breaking our word, President Wilson&apos;s principleshad been accepted by the Italian Government. Sir Robert Bordensuggested that the acceptance of the Fourteen Points, includingNo. 9, which definitely stated that the readjustment of the Italianfrontiers should be along clearly recognised lines of nationality,involved the scrapping of the 1915 Treaty by Italy.Mr. Lloyd George pointed out that, while this might be thegeneral impression, it was not actually the case. The point hadbeen raised by Signor Orlando at the discussions with regard tothe German armistice, and we and the French had pointed out to the Italians that we were only agreeing to the Fourteen points in so far as they affected Germany. There was no reference tothe Fourteen Points in the armistice concluded with Austria.Mir. Hughes agreed that there was a fundamental differencebetween the two armistices, as one had and the other did not havea definite relation to the Fourteen Points. With regard to thecountries under German control, we had limited our right ofdealing with them. With regard to the other countries, there wasa tabula rasa. As to these, President Wilson had laid down terms,but they had not been definitely accepted by anyone. He consideredthat our Treaty with Italy involved a positive obligation, and thatwe had entered into no other positive obligation which could over-ride it. The Italians were really on an even stronger footing asregards their Treaty claims than we were as regards the Freedomof the Seas. He agreed with Mr. Lloyd George that,it would be fatal for us to make only a pretence of backing Italy.Mr. Bonar Law suggested that President Wilson would notbe disposed to accept the distinction with regard to the applica-tion of his Fourteen Points, and would be prepared to use financialpressure to make the Italians, and ourselves, too, comply withthem.
Mr. Lloyd George said that Baron Sonnino, when the. Four-teen Points were mentioned, always put in the proviso &quot; Subjectto the principle of security.&quot; That principle was, after all, onlythe same as the one which Mr. Hughes and General Botha were putting up as regards the German Pacific Colonies and GermanSouth-West Africa. That principle would have to be applied tosome extent even as regards. Germany itself. It would be impos-sible to give Poland her rights without taking over some Germanpopulation.Mr. Balfour pointed out that an even more difficult instancewas that created by the homogeneous German population whichlived within the natural strategic frontiers of Bohemia.Sir Robert Borden suggested that considerations of this character might heir) us subsequently in fecunng direct annexationof the Pacific Islands and German South-West Africa as againstsubmitting them to a mandatory regime.The general trend of the discussion was That, while every effort should be made to persuade Italy totake up a reasonable attitude on these questions, theBritish Government was undoubtedly bound to give Italyits genuine support if Italy insisted on the fulfilment ofthe terms of the Pact of London.Intervention in 2. Mr. Lloyd George mentioned that he had had a communica-tion from the Labour Party with regard to our intervention inthe Caucasus. He understood that with regard to that matter afull meeting of the Imperial War Cabinet was to have an explana-tion from Lord Curzon. Meanwhile, he wished to point out thatthere was very strong feeling on the subject.Mr. Barnes agreed, and considered that the Socialist presswas going to make our interference in Russia its next bigfeature. He thought it desirable that we should have much morenews in the press about Russia.Mr. Lloyd George agreed, and said that what was needed werefull accounts in the press every day about the state of affairs inRussia, corresponding to those now furnished about Germany. Ifit was difficult to get enterprising correspondents to go to Russia,the press ought, at any rate, to be put in touch with anybody whohad just returned from Russia, so that they could get at the facts and present them in their own way. There was a correspondent ofthe &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; who had just come back with a glow-ing account of Russian prosperity under Bolshevism. It was desir-able that all the information describing the true state of affairs inthe country should be made public. &apos;Mr. Chamberlain reminded the Imperial War Cabinet thatthis matter had been twice raised at the British War Cabinet, with. a view to the Foreign Office reusing its information for publica-tion. In the first instance, the information was held back for theprotection of our own representatives in Russia. After that, theinformation in the Foreign Office,, including all the true informa-tion from Foreign Office source^, was held uo bfcausp, the ForeignOffice said it was under an obligation to President Wilson not to publish its own information till it had published the Americanforged documents against the Bolsheviks.Mr. Balfonr protested against this version of the ForeignOffice action. He pointed out that the British press had had theAmerican documents, but had not made much use of them because it knew their unreliable character.
Lord Milner asked whether his colleagues had read Mr. Lock-harfs report.  Apparently this had not been generally circulated.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs undertook to seethat Mr. Lockharfs report was circulated to members ofthe Imperial War Cabinet.Mr. Hughes mentioned that there were at this moment inLondon a considerable number of Australians who had made theirescape from Turkish captivity through Russia.At the request of the Imperial War Cabinet Mr. Hughes undertook to get hold of the story which theseescaped Australians had to tell, and see that it was madeavailable for the press.Lord Milner mentioned that MXitvinoff had for some dayspast been trying hard to offer us terms on behalf of the Bolsheviks.Mr. Churchill asked what our policy was to be: were we toleave the Bolsheviks to &quot; stew in their own juice,&quot; or were we toattempt to breakup Bolshevik power? If the latter case, we must first find out what President Wilson&quot; s intentions were. He might be quite averse to any such policy. If so, the other policy would haveto be chosen. In any case, action by small contingents of troops could do no good. If action was to be undertaken, it must be donethoroughly with large forces, abundantly supplied with mechanicalappliances, and, if this was to he done, the country must bestirred up and a large voluntary army collected.Mr. Lloyd George expressed the opinion that barely 5,000volunteers would be found.Mr. Churchill, continuing, said that we must make, up our minds either to allow the Russians to murder one another withoutlet or hindrance, or, in the name of order, to interfere and do itthoroughly. ,Mr. Lloyd George questioned whether the Russians weremurdering each other. The information on this subject wasconfusing.Mr. Bonar Law pointed out that the French had embarked ona career of conquest, in Russia, but not entirely at their own expense, since the Greek troops under their direction were paid byus. He had given instructions that pending a decision by theCabinet as to our policy no further money should be supplied by theBritish Treasury for Greek troops thus employed.Mr. Hughes said that great principles were involved in these decisions. Was the new world to be one in which each nationshould live its own life, or were the victors to prescribe in whatway others should live? In his opinion newly enfranchised people should be allowed to choose their own way. We should withdraw from Russia and allow the Russians to adopt what government they liked. He quoted the opinion of one of his colleagues in theAustralian Parliament, an opinion reflecting the feelings of halfAustralia. This opinion was that the Allied professions of fighting for justice and liberty would be entirely stultified by a continuance of intervention in Russia.Mr. Balfour said that the Foreign Office attitude in thismatter was continually misrepresented. He had again and again,both in public speeches and in telegrams and despatches, laiddown that, in the view of the British Government, Russia mustchoose its own regime. If Russia chose to be Bolshevik, we shouldnot gainsay it. Our intervention had been undertaken as a warmeasure. It had been undertaken in conjunction with France andItaly, and everyone had joined to induce America and japan to furnish troops, lacking elsewhere, to reconstitute an eastern front against Germany. That, in the inception, was the soleobject of intervention in Russia.[530-22]C
Mr. Lloyd George added, &apos;* and to save the resources of western Siberia from falling into German hands.&quot;Mr. Balfour agreed. Continuing, he said it might be worthwhile to circulate seme of his telegrams conveying instructionsto Mr. Lockhart; but he must point out that every Englishmansent to Russia, whatever his instructions, was instinctivelyshocked by the disorder he s .w there, and inevitably became a,politician in spite of official discouragement.Thus we had intervened originally for purely military reasons,and now the armistice had put an end to these reasons. there remained a Czech force in the country, constantly subject to attack by the Bolsheviks. There were also nascent and unstable Govern-ments in Siberia. There were large forces of Japanese with ideasdiffering, perhaps, from ours. There was an American, force which was somewhat inactive. There were small British andFrench forces assisting the Czechs.   So much for Siberia.In Caucasia we were deliberately threatened by the Bolsheviks,who even advocated an attack on India and spent large sums in propaganda.Mr. Barnes pointed out that there was a representative in theBolshevik Government who was especially entrusted with the task of disturbing India.Mr. Balfour, continuing, said that we had gone to Murmanskand Archangel for the same reasons, and also.to save munitionsfrom falling into the hands of the enemy. Since the armistice,however, we had found ourselves the protectors of small democraticGovernments, threatened by Bolsheviks. We had some moralresponsibility towards them. Moreover, winter had come immedi-ately after the armistice, and we could not withdraw our troopsuntil June. He agreed with Mr. Churchill that when June camewe might find against us an overwhelming Bolshevik force, andbe compelled to withdraw ignominiously.Mr. Hughes asked how many troops in all we had in Russia.Lord Milner estimated the number of British troops at about13,000 in Northern Russia and at 4,000 in Siberia. There were also some 10,000 Americans, some; 60,000 Japanese, and a few thousand French and Italian troops. The Siberian forces mightnumber about 150,000.Mr. Balfour said that if we were now to announce that we proposed to leave the country as soon as the season permitted,the result would be to spread despair, and the people whom wewere protecting would say that they must now make peace withthe Bolsheviks.Mr. Montagu asked why we ourselves should not make peace 1with them.Mr. Balfour replied that it was extremely difficult to do so.The Scandinavians, though neutrals, had been forced to breakwdth them, and even Switzerland, the traditional refuge ofdemocrats, was about to do the same. Moreover, in our own defence, we should have to take measures to check the spread of bolshevism. It was one thing to let the Russians &quot;stew in theirown juice,&quot; but quite another to submit to being stewed in theirs.Bolshevism was deliberately aggressive, and a Bolshevik army was being formed with the threat of starvation as an alternative to join it.Mr. Hughes referred to the visit to this country of GeneralMannerheim, and asked whom he had seen and what his objecthad been, and what success he had obtained.Mr. Balfour said that he had seen General Mannerheim,whose object was to get Finland recognised.Mr. Hughes asked what party the General represented.Lord Milner said &quot;the victorious anti-Bolsheviks in Finland.&quot;Mr. Hughes, pointed out that victory over the Bolsheviks hadbeen obtained by German aid, and was now to be maintained by
IWC 45British aid. It was doubtless the General&apos;s object to secure thelatter.Mr. Balfour said that General Mannerheim had made no suchappeal to him.Mr. Lloyd George referred to a Memorandum by Mr. Lockhart,containing statements as to facts, which were to the effect that the-workmen in Russia, were loyal to their Bolshevik leaders, andthat the peasants, though objecting to the food control, could notbe counted on to act against them, vMr. Hughes said tiiat these represented at least 80 per cent,of the population.Mr. Lloyd George, further drew attention to the conclusion ofthe Memorandum, which was to the effect that the Bolsheviks were still the strongest party in Russia; and yet, on the strength of this document, we were to intervene in Russia.Mr. Balfour said that such was not at all his policy.Mr. Lloyd George said that he was in agreement with theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs in his line, both in the past and in the present. He was not sure, however, that this was thesentiment of all concerned; many really desired to interfere becauseof Bolshevismi; interference in that spirit would certainly cause trouble at home. This was riot the only reason against it, but it wasa strong one. He quoted Mr. Fisher as stating that all over thecountry the question was repeatedly asked why the Governmentwas interfering in Russia. Mr. Shaw had told him that the same question was. being put in Scotland, where there was a strong feeling against interference. He agreed with Mr. Balfour that,while the war was going on, our policy had been the right one;the Germans were then creeping Eastwards towards the Don and towards countries furnishing great material resources. The hopeof our being able to enlist Russian sympathies had not been fulfilled.General Poole, for instance, had expected eventually to get amillion men to assist his expedition from Archangel. This ex-pectation had been grievously disappointed; his Russian recruitshad not even approached the figure of a hundred thousand, which,according to Lord Milner &apos;s recollection, had been General Poole&apos;estimate. Though the General had been operating in Russia formany months, he had failed to obtain more than perhaps 3,000Russian adherents, and these were very half-hearted and exceed-ingly costly.It was said that these people should be protected against bolshevism; had we any right to support a minority against amajority because we happened to have political relations with theformer? The parallel of the French Revolution should be borne in mind; we had then intervened in favour of minorities in theVendee and in the South, as, for instance, at Toulon; there was little reason to follow this example.Telegrams had been received stating that the Bolsheviks were disposed to come to terms with us.Mr. Lloyd George read the telegram (No 3600, of the 4thDecember, from Stockholm), and another telegram had just arrived from Stockholm, in confirmation of the previous one. It was alleged that the Bolsheviks were making Avar against us by pro-paganda; but we had no right to complain, for we had four or five armies on their soil, which, in the course of their operations,not infrequently shot Bolsheviks. Now we were preparing to renew the campaign in the spring.To the Caucasus we were sending two divisions; we had 14,000troops in -Murmansk and Archangel, 4,000 in Siberia, and more were being asked for; indeed, if we were to continue fighting inthe spring^ more would be necessary. How could these troops befound?Lord Curzon pointed out that the situation in the Caucasusdiffered completely from that in Russia proper.
Lord Reading observed that President Wilson nad alwaysbeen against interference in Russia, and was certainly anxiousto withdraw American trcops. He would doubtless refer to the promise which had been held out earlier, to the effect that allied intervention would attract Russian sympathy, This expectationhad not been fulfilled.Mr. Lloyd George said that the Secretary had seen GeneralMaynard, from Murmansk, before his departure. GeneralMaynard said that it would be difficult to keep his Serbian, Frenchand Italian contingents together, and he was not altogether happyabout the position of his British troops, who, of course, did not want to go on fighting the Bolsheviks. He had said that theBolsheviks often fought well. The Russians under his commandwere not, in his opinion, strongly anti-Bolshevik, or very different from the Bolsheviks themselves. The Secretary had gathered theimpression that General Maynard was not averse from some arrangement with the Bolsheviks.Sir Robert Borden agreed that we should not continue tofight in Russia, but considered that we had obligations to the czechs. The Canadians had 2,500 men in Siberia, and theCanadian Government was very anxious to get them home.Would it not be possible to make an arrangement with theBolsheviks permitting the withdrawal of the Czechs and of ourown troops, and safeguarding the people who. had co-operated with us? Canada had only consented to send troops to Siberiaafter considerable pressure from himself, and he did not thinkthat opinion would tolerate their remaining in Russia afternavigation opened in the spring.Mr. Bonar Law asked, whether it would not be possible to instruct Mr. Clive to get Litvinoff to put his terms in writing.Mr. Balfour1 did not dissent, but said that care must be taken not to act in such a manner as to alarm our Allies. The French,for instance, were sending tircops to assist the Ukrainians. Itwas also said that the Bolsheviks would keep no terms. In anycase we must ask them not to massacre the adherents of the smallGovernments in the north, and to respect the new small Statesalong the Baltic. This they ought to consent to, as they had recognised them.Mr. Hughes enquired whether this proposal meant tharti wewould agree to the Bolsheviks&apos; terms if they granted certain conditions.Mr. Lloyd Geiorge explained that it was intended to learnwhat their proposals were and to empower Mr. Clive to receive them.Sir Robert Borden said that they should also be required torecognise their debts.Mr. Lloyd George said that they were willing to do so.Lord Reading asked whether this would involve recognising the Bolshevik Government.Mr. Balfour observed that we had recognised them as a defacto Government and then broken off, because they had im-prisoned and murdered our representatives. Pie further pointedout that we could not act alone, as there were other1 Allied troopsin Russia, whom we could not abandon. The French had lentRussia money and supplied the equipment of the Greek troopsacting under General Berthelot.General Botha expressed the opinion that after the great war another war should not be pursued in Russia. We had gone into war for our own protection; it was no concern of ours whoruled in Russia, all we need to do was to find some terms whichwould protect those in.Russia who had stood by us; beyond this we should not interfere.Lord Milner said that he did not entirely agree with the opinions expressed; he was quite opposed to aggressive action
against Bolshevism, but he did not wish the fire to spread; he wished to confine it to the area it had already ravaged. Hethought our going to Archangel when we did was quite justified,but he would like to withdraw from there now What he did not want to see was the spread of Bolshevism to the Don and Tuir-kestan. Bolshevism was, at the present moment, the greatestdanger of the civilised world; he did not wish to attack itsadherents, lest this should provide them with sympathy; but he wished to hold the marches. He would come to terms with theBolsheviks if they agreed to remain within their own boundaries.He would not agree, for instance, to their conquering Siberia.Mr. Lloyd George pointed out that the proposal was to giveauthority to Mr. Clive to receive Litvinoff&apos;s proposals. he understood that there was no opposition, to discovering whatthey might be. When we had received them we might considermeans of obtaining such,safeguards as we considered necessary.Mr. Balfour agreed, provided that this were done unofficially.It was decided that the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should authorise Mr. Olive fro obtain, in writing,from Litvinoff his proposals for an understanding with,the British Government. It was further decided thatthese proposals, when obtained, should be submitted tothe Imperial War Cabinet.Lord Curzon pointed out that the above considerations didnot apply to. the Caucasus; this was not a Bolshevik area, we were concerned in it by reason of our position in the East.   The niem-bers of the War Cabinet would doubtless recollect that general smuts had taken a pessimistic view of the military dangerthreatening us in India through  the Caucasus.    Our militarymovements in that area bad accordingly taken place frotmj East to west.   The position then was very precarious; Russia was beingoverrun;  Turkestan and Afghanistan  threatened; we pushedtroops into Persia then Russia broke up, and in order to stem thetide, we tried to get into touch with the Caucasus, the Cossacks,Alexieff, and others on the outskirts of Russia.   In this wehad net been very successful.   The Caucasus had been invadedby Turks and Germans.    It then became our object to hold the caspian, to keep the enemy from access to the .TranscaspianRailway; we had held Baku for a short time, and then we hadbeen expelled; we still held the Caspian.    Then came theArmistice; the terms required the   Germans   and   Turks   towithdraw  from  the  Caucasus;  they had  not  yet   done  so;and the Germans were still in Tifiis.   The problem there wasnot one of Bo^hevik and anti-Bolshevik, but one of nascent nativeStates not Russian in nationality; for instance, the Georgians,a Christian people, famous in history.    These areas have beenconquered by the Russians after a century&apos;s hard fighting.   TheStates forming there were constantly appealing to us to backthem at the Peace Conference: they wished to hold their ownagainst the world.   British troops were the only Allied troops sosituated as to be able fro protect them, and, should these troops be withdrawn too soon, disorder would immediately follow and these states would not have a. fair chance of constituting themselves ona sound footing.    A cordon should at least be left on the lineBaku-Batum until the Peace  Conference should appoint a mandatory Power fro take charge of the a,rea,Mr. Lloyd George enquired from whom the population inquestion exoected attack.Lord Curzon instanced the case of Bicharakoff, who hadorders from the Russian Government at Omsk to attack them,.Mr. Llovd George said that we appeared committed not onlyto fight the Bolsheviks, but also anti-Bolsheviks.[530-22] D
Mr. Montagu said that he agreed with Lord Curzon to this extent that our troops should be maintained in the Caucasus untilthe armistice terms had been fulfilled, but he was convinced thatwe should not be justified in remaining there any longer after-wards. On the ground of protection for India, he was not ready* to believe that any expenditure of Indian money was justified.Small nations were entitled to our sympathy, but he would let them, rise on their own roots without our assistance.Lord Curzon pointed out that if we withdrew, the Persianfrontier  would be re-opened.    The Azerbaijani Turks wouldinvade Persian Azerbaijan and Persia would appeal to us for. protection.   We should also lose the Caspian.Lord Milner suggested that it was unnecessary to come to adecision there and then. There was noi real difference of opinion.One division at Batum was not a big force to control eight million people under four different Governments. There was no inten-tion of remaining permanently in the country. We should atleast stay until all the Turks and Germans had cleared out, andeven after that we should maintain some force there in order thatthe country should not be in chaos, before the Peace conference had settled its future status. . The spread of chaos was the great danger threatening the Peace Conference. Should large bractsof the world be in a blaze, the Conference would be powerless, and. its decrees worthless.v Mr. Lloyd George pointed out that this might involve a pro-tracted occupation. The Canadian and Australian governments had given notice that they meant to withdraw their troops fromthe various theatres of war ,as soon as possible. The burden ofall occupations would then fall on this country. How did theWar Office propose to find the troops?Mr. Chamberlain suggested that we should make it very clear at the beginning of the Peace Conference that there were areas inour occupation in which we did not wish to remain, and that webegged the League of Nations to make arrangements to relieve us.Mr. Lloyd George enquired who threatened the peace in theCaucasus.Lord Curzon replied that, without considering invasion fromwithout, the Tartars and Armenians would fly at each other&apos;sthroats.Mr. Lloyd George pointed out that enterprises of this character would lead us into trouble. To furnish the troops weshould be asked to continue conscription in this country. Con-scripts could not be kept in such remote regions as Georgia.Lord. Milner agreed that volunteers would have to be depended upon for service of that character, but that it might be necessaryto extend obligatory service to furnish contingents for the occupa-tion of the Rhine.Mr. Churchill said it was a question of keeping 10,000 men for a few weeks pending a decision of the League of Nations orthe Peace Conference to secure order in a valuable country.Mr. Lloyd George thought that this estimate of the time re-quired for the formation of the League, of Nations and for its decision on this subject was optimistic. People, moreover, wouldnot appreciate the necessity of keeping troops in the Caucasus inorder to prevent Georgians, Armenians, and Tartars from attack-ing one another; the British people knew exactly what they had gone to war for, and the continuance of expeditions of this kind would affect recruiting disastrously.Lord Milner said he would rather noi occupy Germany at allwith British troops than abandon the countries in which theysecured order.Mr. Long said that the point was less one of policy than ofthe difficulty of obtaining men.   The maintenance of troops in any
11 IWC45part of1 Russia would, prejudice enlistment when it was most needed.Mr. Lloyd George said that an extension of the MilitaryService Act might be required, but it would not be obtained if thepeople thought that they were to be sent to Murmansk or tothe Georgian-mountains. He asked whether the War Office main-tained their demands for two divisions to be sent to the Caucasus.Lord Milner said that one division might suffice, and that asecond could not be sent without the &quot;War Cabinefs approval.Mr. Lloyd George said that he concluded that the despatch ofthe second was therefore dropped, and enquired how long the first was to remain. If it were to wait until the Peace Conference hadsettled the fate of the country it might have to wait a long time.We might agree to say that if the United States, France, andItaly did not wish to keep troops in Russia, we were also anxiousto withdraw.With regard to Serbia, it was unnecessary to re-open thisquestion until the proposals of M. Litvinoff had been received.Although no definite conclusions were agreed to, the general trend of the above discussion was that the British forces should not be withdrawn from the Caucasus until afterthe Turkish and German forces had been withdrawn; thata second British division should not be sent to theCaucasus without Cabinet authority; and that british forces should not be maintained there longer than couldbe avoided.Restoration and 3. With reference to the Memorandum by the TreasuryIndemnity. (P.46), it was pointed out that it controverted the conclusions ofMr. Hughes&apos; Committee.Mr. Bonar Law explained that instructions for its prepara-tion for his guidance in view of the Inter-Allied Conference thatwas to take place on the subject of indemnities, had been given before the appointment of Mr. Hughes&apos; Committee. It had beenprepared independently, and was not intended as a criticism ofthe work of the Committee. He had, moreover, thought it rightto give the Imperial War Cabinet the opportunity to read it.Consideration of the subject was deferred to the following day.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,December 23, 1918.o
