2Lord Curzon apologised to the Imperial War Cabinet for thetemporary absence of the Prime Minister, who was engaged for themoment at a Conference in connection with a crisis in the cotton trade.Activities of Ger- 1. The Imperial W^ar Cabinet had before them a Note by theman Propaganda.      Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referring to the activitiesof German propagandists (Paper G.T.-6456).Mr. Balfour said it appeared that the Germans were doing their best to carry on their old policy, and that they appeared still to have a regular scheme of espionage and propaganda in force.Before the armistice they had even gone so far as to use their diplo-matic body for the conveyance not only of literature but also of bombs into Switzerland, and thence into Italy.   Their activities were still practically an act of war, and should be regarded as a breach of the armistice.   The French felt very strongly in thematter, and proposed to direct Marshal Foch to  inform  theGerman military authorities that the activities of the german propaganda, information, and espionage services must be broughtto an end, and if this warning did not produce an early result they proposed that a second warning should be given, accompanied bya threat regarding the supply of foodstuffs to Germany.   It wasall right in principle to act on these lines, but the moment it came to a question of the supply of foodstuffs toi Germany our action might clash with the arrangements being made by Mr. Hoover,and also with the activities of the Inter-Allied Maritime Trans-port Council.     He saw no risk, however, in making the threat,and it was undoubtedly our most powerful lever.    In reply to aquestion by Sir Robert Borden, as to whether the United StatesGovernment should not be communicated with first, Mr. Balfoursaid that he would make sure that this was done.Lord Curzon suggested that there was a risk of the Germanssaying that the activities referred to had nothing to do with theGerman Government and were purely Bolshevist in character.Mr. Balfour said that he thought that practically all Germanactivities of this nature emanated from the German Government,and that one could be pretty certain that if we brought pressure tobear on that Government the activities in question would be stopped. Our secret agents and the secret agents of France andthe other Allied Powers all believed that these activities were going on.Mr. Long asked if there was not evidence that there was agood deal of propaganda being distributed among our own sol-diers. He had read some secret reports on the. matter, and there appeared to be a good deal of this going on, which was said to be initiated by Germany.Mr. Balfour thought there was a good deal of truth in what mr. Long had said, and hoped that the War Office was watching the question very carefully.Lord Milner said there was, no doubt, a good deal of Bol-shevist propaganda, but he did not know if it had anything to do with Germany.Mr. Hughes asked if there was any direct evidence that theactivities under discussion were initiated by the German Goyern-ment. He was perfectly sure that it was so, but he wanted toask if it was possible today one&apos;s finger on any concrete case.Mr. Balfour said that since the actual German revolution theevidence was only indirect. As he had already said, not only sir horace Rumbold, but also the French and our own secret agents,all took the view that the activities were initiated by the GermanGovernment.Lord Milner said the question was whether the GermanGovernment was any more to blame for Bolshevism than we were.
Lord Milner again pointed out that what was present to his mind was the difficulty of proving that the activities had anything todo with the German Government. The German Government was just as much afraid of Bolshevism as we were.Mr. Hughes thought that the Germans were a very orderlycommunity, and less likely to incline towards anarchy than ourown people.(At this stage Mr. Lloyd George entered. Lord Curzo,n brieflyexplained to him the discussion which was taking place,and the point to which it had reached.)Sir Joseph Cook pointed out that if the German Governmentsaid the activities had nothing to do with them, it was a surrender of responsibility, and the best of all reasons why Marshal Fochshould step in.Mr. Lloyd George said it was just.as likely that germany would say she was against Bolshevism as much as we were.Sir Robert Borden asked if we knew to what extent theGovernment Departments in Germany were carrying on in thesame way as before the revolution.Mr. Balfour said that in all the different bureaux he under-stood that work was proceeding precisely as it had done beforethe crisis came.Mr. Lloyd George said that in that case there could be noquestion that the warning should be sent.The Imperial War Cabinet decided that-The course of action proposed by the French Government&apos;should be agreed to. They invited the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs to make sure that the UnitedStates Government was informed of the action which itwas proposed to take.The Victuallingand Supply of enemy, Allied, and neutral Countries.2. With reference to the conclusion in connection with thevictualling and supply of enemy, Allied, and neutral countries,which had been agreed to at the Allied conversation held onDecember 3, 1918, Lord Reading pointed out that, up to date,nothing had been done as regards making Germany surrenderships for this purpose, and the time had now come when we wanted these ships very badly. The question was, how werethey to be obtained, as there was nothing in the armistice aboutthe surrender of merchant shipping. The only lever we could use was to say that if Germany wanted foodstuffs we must, havethe ships. It then came to an exchange of quantities, andwould bind us more or less to provide the food, while at the sametime we had no means at the moment of finding out the state ofthe food supply in Germany.Mr. Lloyd George asked if this state of affairs was in anyway the result of Mr. Hoover coming over here and taking thingsinto his own hands.Lord Reading did not think it had anything to do with that.He suggested that the best way to get the ships would) be throughMarshal Foch, or through the Conference about to assemble forthe extension of the armistice. ,: Mr. Hughes thought that we ought to say to Germany, &quot;Ifyou want food, hand over your ships; otherwise no food.&quot;Mr.. Balfour wondered whether, if we did it in this manner,we would, or would not, be precluded later on from saying toGermany, &quot; It is true you have given us your ships, but as youare not behaving well we do not intend to give you food.&quot;Mr. Hughes did not thinb that we would be precluded! from doing this. &apos;
Mr. Lloyd George asked Lord Reading to put before theImperial War Cabinet a definite proposal. The Imperial WarCabinet was not now in a position to discuss the matter.Lord Reading quite agreed. He pointed out, however, that,,as the Armistice Conference was now assembling, he had thoughtthat it was a good time to raise the question.Mr. Lloyd George said if there was any definite questionwhich Lord Reading could not decide on his own responsibility,then he had better ask the Imperial War Cabinet for a decision.Sir Joseph Maclay said that there was nothing in the armis-tice to compel Germany to give up ships.Mr. Lloyd George said that was quite true, but at the sametime there was nothing in the armistice about food. He then read anote which had been handed to him by the Deputy First Sea Lord,which suggested that the question of the surrender of german shipping might be referred to an Inter-Allied Naval commission which was now at Wilhelmshaven. Mr. Lloyd George then askedLord Reading definitely what he wanted the Imperial WarCabinet to do.Lord Reading replied that he wanted the Cabinet to say how we were to get the ships.. Mr. Hughes suggested that we should take the ships and use them as we thought fit, and make no conditions.Lord Reading undertook to consider the matter, and, ifunable to arrange it himself, to make definite proposals to the Imperial War Cabinet.Proposed Com- 3. The Imperial War Cabinet had before them a Memoran-munications Board,   dum by the Secretary of State for War with regard to a proposedCommunications Board (Paper G.T.-6449).Sir Robert Borden referred briefly to the matters raised inthe paper, and especially to the proposal for the establishment of similar Boards in the self-governing Dominions. He doubted if the Imperial War Cabinet were at the present time in aposition to discuss the question.Mr. Lloyd George agreed that very big questions were raised in the Memorandum, and that a decision could not be arrived winter that meeting.The Imperial War Cabinet decided To postpone the discussion of the matter.4. The Imperial War Cabinet had before them a Paper pre-pared by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff in connectionwith the military commitments of the British Empire after peacehad been signed (Paper G.T.-6434).Mr. Lloyd George asked for how long a period it was sug-gested that we should maintain the forces proposed in the Memo-randum. Further, he wanted to know why seven to ten divisions were required as a reserve in rear on the Western Front.The Chief of the Imperial Genera! Staff said that marshal foch had originally asked for eleven divisions in the front area and for eleven in reserve in rear. So far as we could ascertainat present, there were forty-five German divisions facing the-British Army on the Western Front. Germany had still got1,700,000 men under arms, and everything possible was being done by the Germans to recover military order. The German peace army before the war had numbered 800,000 men. She had. now on the Western Front 12 armies, each of 15 divisions, but ofcourse these divisions were weak.   There was still a good deal ofMilitary Commit-ments remainingafter Peace hasbeen signed.
disorganisation in the army, and Prince Rupprecht haid recentlybeen replaced by another General,. whose orders seemed to beobeyed. The same applied in the case of the Crown Prince&apos;s army.Mr. Lloyd George referred to the fact that the Germans hadsurrendered 27,000 machine-guns, and he was under the impres-sion that they claimed that they had not even sufficient machine-guns left to deal with the internal disorders in Germany.Lord Milner asked if anyone really proposed that at thisstage we could materially reduce our army. 14 to 20 divisionswas less than one-third of what we had been maintaining up todate, and there were many uncertainties in the European situa-tion.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that no onethought&apos;for a moment that, with the German Army as it was,there would be any chance of their getting to Paris, but if wewent in for any big reduction of our forces it would be takingsome risk if the French Army were also to bp reduced.Mr. Hughes raised the point - as to whether it would benecessary to maintain an Army of Occupation until germany had paid a War Indemnity.Mr. Lloyd George replied that that was exactly the point which he was making. The question was, was it not possiblefor us to ensure the indemnity being paid by economic pressureexerted through the Navy, just as well as by an Army of Occupa-tion.Mr. Balfour said he would like to be quite sure that wewould be in a position to bring sufficient economic pressure tobear. In view of the possibility of our not having the same con-trol of telegraphs, &amp;e, and of our having to relax our censorship,the blockade might to a certain extent break down.Mr. Lloyd George said that he was inclined to agree withthe proposals submitted by the War Office, provided that therewas no proposal that the maintenance of these forces should be permanent., Lord Milner pointed out that the only permanent forces whichit was proposed to maintain were those for guarding our ownEmpire, which had already been approved by the Cabinet. steps were now proceeding with a view to- providing such forces. Hewas afraid, however, that, in order to get the men, it might benecessary to increase the bonuses offered.Mr. Llo)rd George said that, unless anyone had any criticismto offer, he thought the Imperial War Cabinet might approve ofthe proposed forces being maintained for the present. Withregard to the Caucasus, Mr. Lloyd George said that if we com-mitted ourselves to operations in that region he could see no chance of our being able to get out of such operations for sometime to come.Lord Milner thought that our action in the Caucasus wasthe most economical way of dealing with the situation in theMiddle East,Lord Curzon thought that, however reluctant everyone wasto embark on operations in the Caucasus, we would be compelled,at any rate for a time, to maintain troops there. He was some-what surprised, however, at the size of the force two divisions which was proposed.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that it was proposed that one of the divisions should be an Indian one.Sir Robert Borden thought that a good deal would dependon what was settled as regards a League of Nations.Mr. Lloyd George said that he doubted if much advantage would accrue from; our . operations in , the Caucasus, and asked what responsibility we had, for instance, at Batum.[530-20] C
Lord Curzon said that what we had to do for the moment was to prevent disorder in the Caucasus, and give a chance to theautonomous states that were struggling into existence. whether we liked it or not, he thought that for the moment we must keeptroops there and keep open the Batum Baku railway; but, ofcourse, it was only provisional.Mr. Lloyd George asked what we were going to do aboutTurkestan.Lord Milner said that, in his opinion, the War Office pro-posal arrived at the greatest possible economy of force, for if weheld the Batum Baku railway we would screen great tracts of territory. We would need fewer troops in Persia and Turkestan,,and we would not have any anxiety about Armenia.Mr. Lloyd George said that he doubted if we were under any obligation to do this, and asked where we were going to get themen from. The proposal was to have 40,000 to 50,000 men inthe Caucasus, when we could only find about 70,000 for India.Lord Milner quite agreed that the estimated size of the forcemight be too great,, and perhaps it would not need to be two divisions.Mr. Lloyd George said that, unless the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff wanted a decision at once, he thought the questionof our future policy in the Caucasus should be reserved for con-sideration by a very full Cabinet, at which the Chief of theImperial General Staff should explain his views.Mr. Balfour pointed out that it was a very difficult subject. -The question had already been, considered by a very strong com-mittee, of which Lord Curzon was the chairman. He was most reluctant that we should undertake operations in the Caucasus,but for the moment there was so much Bolshevism in all these regions that he thought it was necessary for us to do something.Mr. Lloyd George did not think that Bolshevism was by any means such a great danger to us as the old Russian Empire was,with all its aggressive officials and millions of troops. Thesituatrbn with which we were faced now was not, in his opinion,nearly so difficult as in previous years. The matter would haveto be considered by a very full Cabinet, and he would then askLord Curzon to explain the situation.Lord Curzon said that he could either explain the situation to the Cabinet, or, if preferred, he would circulate a paper on thesubject. In his opinion there was a very big distinction betweentemporary and permanent occupation of the Caucasus. It wasunthinkable to say that we should keep two - divisions there foran indefinite length of time, but at the same time it was equallyunthinkable that we could withdraw our troops now.Mr. Lloyd George asked how many troops were there now.Lord Milner said that there was one division on its way toBatum.Mr. Lloyd George said that in any case the matter must beconsidered by a full Cabinet before we committed ourselves, ashe was afraid that our occupation might become permanent ifwe went there at all, unless the United States and Prance co-operated.Sir Robert Borden pointed out that one could not be sure of Russia so long as a Bolshevist Government was in power.The Imperial War Cabinet decided that (a.) The question of our undertaking . operations in theCaucasus should be considered by a full Imperial WarCabinet, at which Lord Curzon should be asked to. explain the situation;(b.) With the exception of the force proposed for theCaucasus, the War Office proposals should be approved.
Retention of 6. The Imperial War Cabinet had before them a Memoran-Dominion Troops dum prepared by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, on thein our Armies of contribution of the Overseas Dominions towards the Army ofOccupation. Occupation in Germany (Paper G.T.-6459).Sir Robert Borden said that, dealing with the proposal underthe two stages as suggested in the Memorandum, he did notthink there would be any objection to retaining two Canadiandivisions during the period of partial demobilisation, since he doubted if in any case it would be possible to get these divisionsback to Canada before the Peace Conference had been concluded.As regards the Canadian contribution to an Army of Occupationfor an indefinite period after demobilisation, he thought great difficulties were involved, and that public opinion in Canada. would not support compulsory service for such a purpose. Therewas a strong feeling that our men should be brought back as soonas possible. Any troops provided by Canada for an Army ofOccupation after the treaty of peace would have to be raised by voluntary enlistment, and whether it would be practicable to raise a division in that way was quite uncertain. It would be necessaryto obtain information in Canada, and from the corps now at thefront.   He would endeavour to obtain such information.Mr. Hughes said that as regards Australia he might givethe same reply as to the period of partial demobilisation, andthat he did not think that any objection would be advanced to two Australian divisions being retained during this period. As- in the case of the Canadian troops, it would not be possible, hethought, to get the troops back before&apos; the Peace Conferenceended. As regards, however, the proposal that Australia should contribute troops to an army of Occupation for an indefinite period, he thought the same arguments Avould prevail against itas Sir Robert Borden had advanced in the case of Canada, buthe did not think that the Australian people would approve ofthe proposal in any circumstances. He was not in a position,however, to do more than give his personal opinion, and the: Aiis-Australian Government would have to consider the proposal.Sir Joseph Cook asked if there was any urgency aboutcoming to a decision as regards the Army of Occupation afterdemobilisation.Lord Milner said that there was no hurry at all, and thatfor the moment it was quite sufficient for the War Office to get adefinite answer as regards the retention of Canadian and Aus-Australian troops during the period of partial demobilisation.Sir Joseph Maclay raised the question of additional shippingbeing now available to take 20,000 troops back to Australia.Mr. Hughes replied that arrangements had already beenmade to use 26 ships in December and January, and that every-thing possible was being done to fill ships returning to theCommonwealth.The Imperial War Cabinet (a.) Took note of the views expressed by Sir Robert Bordenand Mr. Hughes respectively that there would be noobjection to two Canadian divisions and two australian -lian divisions forming part of the Army of Occupa-tion in Germany during the period of partial. demobilisation;Demobilisation. 5. The Adjutant-General asked if, in view of the discussion.which had just taken place, he could proceed with the demobilisa-tion of the army to a force of 21 divisions with their accessories,exclusive of the troops required in the United Kingdom, India,and other garrisons abroad.This was agreed to.
(&amp;.) Postponed for discussion at a later date the proposalfor Canada and Australia to contribute troops toi theArmy of Occupation after demobilisation,League of Nations. 7. Sir Robert Borden asked if there was a committee dealingwith the League of Nations, because, if so, he thought that theDominions ought to be represented on it, since any opinion ad-advanced at the Peace Conference by the representatives of theBritish Empire would presumably be assumed to include the viewsof the self-governing Dominions.Mr. Lloyd George said that the matter was in the hands ofLord Robert Cecil.General Smuts said that the Section.which was dealing withthe matter could not start work before next Monday, as lord robert Cecil, who had been appointed to take charge of this work,was busy in connection with the General Election.Mr. Lloyd George said that the Dominions certainly must berepresented at the discussions.The Imperial War Cabinet decided that The Dominions should have representatives on- the Sectionof the Foreign Office considering the question of a Leagueof Nations, and invited Mr. Balfour to make representa-tions in this sense to Lord Robert Cecil.8. Mr. Hughes asked if it was proposed to discuss any ofthe Peace Conference questions, such as the League of Nations,before the Prime Minister&apos;s visit to Paris.Mr. Balfour then produced a telegram which had just reached him, from Colonel House, expressing great regret that the PrimeMinister and Mr. Balfour were unable to be in Paris on the 16thDecember to meet President Wilson.The Prime Minister said that he considered it imperative,before proceeding to Paris, to take a number of decisions on thequestion of demobilisation. He could not do; this during thepresent week, owing to the absence of most of the Ministers con-cerned in connection with the General Election. He therefore proposed to devote Monday and Tuesday of next week to the ques-tion of demobilisation. On Wednesday he would like toi have a discussion with the Imperial War Cabinet on the questions hewas to discuss at Paris. There were one or two matters on whichhe wished to* speak very plainly in Paris, and he wished to consult his colleagues on these.The Imperial War Cabinet agreed that: The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should expressregret to Colonel House that the Prime Minister was unable to reach Paris on the 16th December1, and should explain the reasons, arranging for conferences with president Wilson on some subsequent date.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.
