1. THE Imperial War Cabinet bad before them the follow-ing documents on the subject of a League of Nations: Report of Sir Walter Phillimore&apos;s Committee (Paper P.-26).Memorandum addressed by the Scandinavian Governments tothe Dutch, Swiss, and Spanish Governments (PaperP.-30).Memorandum, by General Smuts (Paper P.-44:).Memorandum by Mr. A. E. Zimmern, Foreign Office (PaperP.-68).Memorandum by Lord Eustace Percy, Foreign Office (PaperP.^69).Memorandum by the Admiralty (Paper P.-78).Mr. Lloyd George, in opening the Meeting, referred toGeneral Smuts&apos; Paper (Paper P.-44), which he considered one ofthe ablest State Papers he had read. He greatly regretted theabsence of the author, as he would have liked him to take partin the discussion. He was glad, however, to see that Lord robert cecil was present, as he had been in charge of this subject onbehalf of the War Cabinet, and he hoped that Lord Robert wouldconsent to initiate the discussion.Lord Robert Cecil said that he wished to associate himself with what the Prime Minister had said about General Smuts&apos;Paper. He regarded it as a valuable contribution to the litera-ture on the subject. There was, he thought, a danger in dealingwith the subject of the League of Nations, that it might beregarded solely as a device for keeping the peace. No doubt thiswas its original object, but, apart from formal machinery foradjusting international disputes, some organisation was requiredto deal with a number of other questions. This point of view wasably set forth in General Sanuts&apos; Paper.Two things might be said at this stage in the world&apos;s historywithout fear of contradiction. The first was that war had become so destructive that any future war would imperil, or evendestroy civilisation. The second was that international relationshad become so complicated that a new organisation was necessaryto deal with them.For instance, many new States were coming into being and means must be found to safeguard them. The New Europe wouldbe full of explosive material. To take one case, the Polish question would be very difficult unless great care be taken to avoid creatingin the centre of Europe a new and worse Balkan problem. Thesame might be said of the Caucasus and other parts of the world.The difficulties of the new States would be very great. Theywould require help to secure their existence. Failing such,, helptheir chances of ultimate success would be very doubtful. the ownership and administration of Constantinople, and of theconquered enemy colonies, were other cases in point.. There wasalso the Chinese question, which had lately engaged the attentionof the Foreign Office. Hitherto the policy there had been one ofspheres of influence. For various reasons, among them the aggression of Japanese policy, this method had not given very satisfactory results. Our Minister in China had recently sug-gested the pooling of all concessions under international control,in order that they might be administered for the benefit of humanity. These were merely examples of common problems to bedealt with. There was also the necessity of controlling water-ways, straits, international rivers, and international railways.We must therefore contemplate the creation of machinery otherthan that required merely to keep the peace. Without an organisa-tion of this kind the League of Nations had a poor chance of^pro-lonsed existence. There had been Inter-Allied organisationsduring the war which might serve as models for the bases of the
a IWC 4&amp;future League of Nations. There were, for instance, the supreme war Council at Versailles and the Inter-Allied Maritime Trans-port Council. Anyone who had dealt with these bodies mustknow that there were great possibilities in them, provided therewere a genuine desire to co-operate, and a permanent secretariatto keep the organisation alive in the intervals between formal meet-ings. Consequently, such had been the bases suggested in PaperP.-29.* In broad outline the suggestion was to establish in someneutral capital a permanent organisation presided over by a man of the greatest possible ability. A man, for instance, of thecalibre of M. Venizelos. Such a man would be the chief head ofthe secretariat, to be established in such a base as Geneva. Therewould be annual conferences of Ministers, Prime Ministers, and ministers for Foreign Affairs of the principal nations of theworld to act as the executive committee, representing the whole body of the League of Nations. Every four years there wouldbe a general meeting of the League; the most important work would be done by the secretariat and by the annual meetings.There would be, in addition, commissions to deal with currentwork. For instance, a judicial commission to adjudicate on justi-appreciable disputes; administrative commissions fro deal with suchmatters as waterways; a commission mainly of enquiry into suchmatters as disarmament (which might be thought the most impor-tant of all), or international industrial commissions, (also amatter of the highest importance).The. annual conferences would consider the chief points ofinternational interest at the moment, and would revise treatieswhich were not working well, or were out of date.   It was amatter of common experience that treaties were made as if foreternity, but in the course of time become anachronistic.If at any time a quarrel arose between any States in theLeague, or indeed any States in the world, likely to lead to dangerof war, a special meeting of the executive conferences would be summoned. The secretariat in calling the conferences wouldsummon both sides toi the dispute to state their cases publicly.The object was not so much coercion, as to procure delay and force the parties to come into the open and submit their dispute fro thehighest authority the world could supply.Should war ensue, he believed it would be possible in thisway to confine it to very narrow limits, and to prevent a wojrld-wide conflagration such as we had just suffered. This plan wasin accordance with the report of the Phillimore Committee, andwith the latest statements of President Wilson:In conclusion, he would like to make one observation. It was unnecessary at such a meeting to lay stress on the urgency of saving the world from war. During the election he had becomeaware of a very strong state of feeling in this country: and he hadbeen impressed by the growth of class bitterness. He was verymuch afraid that, unless the Government showed that it was very seriously in earnest about this matter, the view would grow thatthe present Governmental machinery was not to be trusted to dealwith serious questions. The feeling would grow that the richerclasses were not opposed to war, and that, indeed, they regarded itas favourable to their class interests. The opinion, he believed, wasfalse, but it must be admitted that the Press organs of thewealthier classes bad shown the least enthusiasm for schemes toput down war. He therefore urged that we should show our-selves to be really in earnest about this question.Mr. Lloyd George said that before proceeding with the dis-cussion he wished to have one question settled at once. Therewere In General Smuts&apos; Paper a few illustrations which he thoughtit would be advisable to cut out before the Paper was shown to* This paper has since been circulated to full Imperial War Cabinet,
President- Wilson. He suggested that the Secretary should beauthorised to reprint the Paper with the omission of certainillustrations on page 8, which he referred to.(This was agreed to.)Mr. Bonar Law pointed out that General Smuts dealt morewith the question of the use of force than Lord Robert Cecil.Mr. Chamberlain observed that the question depended moreupon American opinion than on any other save our own. he therefore suggested that we should hear President Wilspn&apos;s views before publishing ours. President Wilson, for instance, hadobjected to the publication of the PhiUimore Report, &quot;and had wished to expound his own ideas to us first. It was worth noting that Republican opinion in the United States didnot entirely back the President. He instanced the views ex-pressed by Senator Lodge. It might, therefore, be desirable notto go further than Lord Robert Cecil, until we knew how far theAmerican Government would go. For instance, would they put their forces at the disposal of an International Council? Thiswas more than the British War Cabinet could do within theBritish Empire. It could not, for instance, order out the forcesof Canada and Australia without the consent of the canadian and Australian Governments. General Smuts&apos; scheme, therefore,demanded more than we could effect even in our own Dominions.Mr. Lloyd George said that he thought that this was an over-statement of General Smuts&apos; conclusions. It was not suggestedthat the Council should have executive power to call out the forcesof any given State. It could ask a. given State to act as mandatory.The Versailles Council was taken as a model, and there had alwaysbeen a referendum from its advice to the executive Governments.Mr. Bonar Law drew attention to pages 17 and 18 of general smuts&apos; Paper as suggesting that action should follow automaticallyin certain contingencies.Lord Robert Cecil said that this only applied in the case ofrefusal to discuss a dispute at all.Mr. Bonar Law maintained that paragraph 19, nevertheless,,endowed the Council with executive authority.Lord Robert Cecil pointed out that, if any &quot;State broke the-agreement to submit to a moratorium, all the other LeaguedNations would automatically beat war with it. This would be acondition to the Peace Treaty. General Smuts did not really go further than himself or the Phillimore Committee, and did not propose that the League should determine the military contribu-tion of each country.Mr. Bonar Law said that General Smuts really did go further.For instance, he said that if one State did abide by arbitration, allthe other Leagued States would be bound to use their forces toback that State.Mr. Hughes said that he wished to make a statement on thissubject. He had from time to time expressed his views which mighthave misled his colleagues and others. . He wished, therefore, to declare that in his opinion some organisation for the control ofinternational affairs was essential. It was not only called for asa result of this war, but would have been necessary without it.One reason for this was the growth of the international proletariat.He did not hesitate to state that there was at the present time moreaffinity between a British and a German or Russian syndicalist thanbetween him and his bourgeois fellow-countrymen. In the next25 years the government of the world would pass into the h^ndsof the proletariat. That might, perhaps, be retarded, but it would come. He did not say that it would be permanent, but of its adventhe was certain.   It was in relation to this prospect that we should
consider the advantage or disadvantage of tne proposed Leagueof Nations. Many of the views concerning it were inspired] by great ideals, but we should examine the goal to which they would lead us. If, for instance, an international organisation werecreated that would legislate in the economic sphere, and, if itimposed an 8 hours working-day throughout the world, thosebarriers of conflicting interest which now existed between theworkers of different countries would be removed and nationalantagonisms would largely disappear.Mr. Bonar Law said that an 8 hours day in Russia and inEngland would not necessarily produce an equality of production.Mr. Hughes, continuing, said that we should not now be dis-cussing the League of Nations if President Wilson had not made it the corner-stone of his Peace Temple, and if we did not expectin a couple of days to be forced to discuss it with him. He wishedtherefore, to point out that the most moderate scheme as yet putforward, and the one least threatening to the independence of governments, was the President&apos;s own. He read the followingextracts from pronouncements of the President to the Council: President Wilson&apos;s Fourteenth Point is as follows: &apos;?&apos; A general association of nations must be formedunder specific covenants for the purpose of affordingmutual guarantees of political independence and terri-tarial integrity to great and small States alike.&quot; (The 8thJanuary, 1918.)At Mount Vernon on the 4th July, 1918, President Wilsonnamed among the objects for which Americans entered the war: &quot; The establishment of an organisation of peacewhich shall make it certain that the combined power oifree nations will check every invasion of right, and serve to make peace and justice the more secure by affording adefinite tribunal of opinion to which all must submit, andby which every international readjustment, that cannotbe amicably agreed upon by the people directly concerned,shall be sanctioned.&apos;&apos;Sir H. Drummond, in a note to Mr. Balfour (15th November,1917, War Cabinet, G.T.-2667), says:-&quot;He (Colonel House) told me that the Presidentthought it better that the Government of the UnitedStates should not in any way be committed to a cut-and-dried plan for the establishment of a League of Nations.The President hoped that if any nation showed an aggressive disposition; or clearly intended to go to war,Great Britain, the United States, Prance, and perhapssome other nations should Oocme to an understanding be-tween themselves as to what attitude they should adopt,and that, having come to a decision on that point, theyshould then determine what steps should be taken tomake it effective. Colonel House added that the Presi-dent and he were discouraging in the United States dis-cussions as to the League of Nations, &amp;o, and that hehad succeeded in employing a number of advocates of theLeague on various work immediately connected with the prosecution of the war.&quot;In the Times of December 1918 President Wilson is reportedto have denied that he had expressed approval of thescheme of the League of Nations to enforce peace.[530-23]C
In the Observer, of 22nd December, 1918, President Wilsonis reported to have said, on the previous day, in. acknovv^lodging a degree conferred on him at the Sorbonne: &quot;My conception of the League of Nations is justthis: that it shall operate as the organising moral forceof the men throughout the world, and that whenever, orwhatever, wrong and aggression are planned or con-templated, this searching light of conscience will be turned upon them, and men everywhere will ask: &apos; what are tne purposes that you hold in your heart against thefortunes of the world?&apos; Just a little exposure will settlemost questions. If the Central Powers had dared to dis-cuss tiie whole purposes of this war for a single fortnightit never would have happened, and if, as should be, theywere forced to discuss it for a year, war would have beeninconceivable.&apos;&quot;&apos;He ventured to say that the enforcement of a year&apos;s discussion was the right thing.Lord Robert Cecil pointed out that this was the moratoriumwhich he had suggested.Mr. Hughes, said that there was no question of disarmament and determining the economic status of the world.  All that was proposed was that nations should be compelled to submit to thearbitrament of their peers.   Was it advisable to go further thanPresident Wilson had suggested in the speeches from which hehad quoted?  He thought not.   He agreed that General Smuts&apos;Paper was a very fine paper, but he regarded the proposals in it asincompatible with national sovereignty.   Was it possible to do with the United States, Japan, France, and Italy what we couldnot do with our own Dominions.   He drew attention to a Paper&apos;by Mr. A. E. Zimmern (P. 68), which he regarded as a severelypractical   comprehensive pronouncement.    It did not aim too high, and as far as possible avoided both Scylla and Charybdis.It  suggested  a   Council  Of  Governments  each  vested  withits own sovereignty,  such as  we  had known at  Versailles.He   asked   that   this   paper   be   considered   in.  conjunctionwith the other.    It was not inconsistent with Lord&apos; robert cecil&apos;s Paper, which dealt   with machinery rather than withprinciples, and, as Lord Robert Cecil had caused it to be circulated,he assumed he would not object to attention being drawn to it.There was also another Paper circulated by the Admiralty (P. 78),with which he was in complete agreement.   It showed that the foundation of our national existence depended on a strong and in-dependent Navy, and that it would be fatal to depend for our naval protection on any allotment made by a League of Nations.Our coast-line was seven times longer than that of the UnitedStates, and freedom of the seas could spell no good for us.He would, therefore, urge Mr. Lloyd George not to commit the Governments of the Empire to any League of Nations going beyond the functions suggested in President Wilson&apos;s speeches.The President would doubtless explain his ideas on a League ofNations, as he had forced the matter on the world&apos;s attention.We should then know what he had in his mind and could discuss it. The compulsory reference of disputes to the tribunal and ayear for consideration, which he had proposed, were of the utmost importance. Nothing but a real dispute would survive a year&apos;discussion, but if compelling force was to be supplied, let it reside in the four nations that had fought this war to victory. Thesenations had common ideas, and could work together to maintainthe world&apos;s peace. Nothing should be done to impair our rightto maintain and to control exclusively such navy as was essentialto our safety.Mr. Barnes said that it was a mistaken idea that President
IWG 46Wilson^was responsible for me conception 01 a, JLeague of Nations.That conception had &quot;originated many years ago, and it had beenprominently in many peoples mind directly the war started. Theidea might naturally be traced to international intercourse, andit had two tendencies: the iirst, a practical tendency, as illustrated by the Conference at Berne in lu06, where a certain number of delegates from different countries met to study the question of theamelioration of industrial conditions; the second, Utopian in character, as instanced by the Conference of Socialists of various countries, which assembled every three years but which was com-pletely dominated by the German delegates. The idea of &quot; ruleby proletariat&quot; was a perverted form of Socialism. The trueSocialistic idea was the co-operation of all classes in the govern-ment of the country. Nothing but harm could come from theperverted form, of Socialism, and it was quite clear that the work-ing men of this country were getting more and more apprehensive of the danger of such rule. The war had added to the originalconception of the functions of a League of Nations the idea of the unification and improvement of industrial conditions, but progress had not been made in this direction, as the Trades Union leaders in this and other countries had been prevented during the warfriom coming together. In his view, the League of Nations mustconsist of the Great Powers of the world, and it should, on theone hand, police and keep order in the small and newly createdcountries, such as the Ukraine, Finland, &amp;c, and, on the other, itshould be empowered to investigate industrial conditions in allcountries, and to afford protection against oppression by the moralsense of the world. The disintegration of Europe imposed this duty upon the League of Nations. In all probability a great dealof the work of the Peace Conference would have to be done byCommittees, but it would be necessary for the Conference itselfto enunciate certain guiding principles. About six months agoPresident Wilson, in one of his speeches, had defined the Leagueof Nations as a body of nations coming together and agreeingnet to make aggression, and, in the event of any nation acting inan aggressive fashion, that the rest should concert the necessarypreventive measures. In Mr. Barnes&apos; opinion it was essential tohave some central authority of an international character, with executive powers. The League of Nations should aspire eventually to become a body of free communities on the model afforded bythe British Empire. As regards the practical side of the question,he thought that, whatever centre might be agreed upon, thereshould be the rudiments of the International Council permanentlyestablished with a permanent secretariat. He would set up theCouncil at once to deal with broad principles, technical mattersbeing left to be dealt with towards the end of the Conference..Mr. Hughes said that he agreed that the rudiments of theCouncil, with a permanent secretariat, might be established very shortly. He hoped he had not given the Cabinet the impression that by &quot;rule by proletariat&quot; he had meant Bolshevist rule.What he had intended to convey was that Labour was destinedto rule and what kind of rule that would be depended largely uponthe policy of existing governments. .Sir Robert Bordem said that, no doubt, at some later date theCabinet would take up General Smuts&apos; propositions in detail, inorder to see what practical effect could be given to them. he wished to associate himself with previous speakers in paying histribute to the great service he felt General Smuts had performedin producing his statesmanlike examination of the project of a league of Nations. General Smuts had taken a wide and fineconception of a method by which nations, great and small, shouldhave their quarrels settled by reference to a Council and not byrecourse to war. It was very necessary that international rules should be laid down and observed, and that force, if required,
should be exerted in order to ensure their observance. The peace ofthe world depended upon public opinion, because, although in any-orderly civilised country order depended upon the force behind,that force required the sanction of public opinion. He agreed with. General bmuts that the procedure of the Inter-Allied Con-ference at Versailles might usefully be followed by the new Inter-national Council. Subject to certain reservations in regard tomatter of detail, he thought that General Smuts&apos; proposals would afford a most useful basis of discussion at the Peace Cou-ference, and he would agree that the Prime Minister and theForeign Secretary should use those proposals as their brief whentalking over the question with President Wilson. It was quitetrue that the idea of a League of Nations did not originate withthe President, as it had been discussed at least fifty years ago.It was universally felt, he thought, that the awful sufferingoccasioned by this war made it imperative that some such piro-vision as outlined by General Smuts should be made as an alter-native to war.Mr. Balfour said that it would be useful to the PrimeMinister and himself to be instructed by the Cabinet as to whatreply they should give to a question which might be put to them at the Conference. The delegates would, at the Peace Conference,endeavour to rearrange the map of Europe, which was a dutyfrom which they could not escape. They would hope so to&apos; arrangeit that it should conform as precisely as possible to the wishes ofthe inhabitants. In this it was impossible to hope for completesuccess; nor, indeed, would any arrangement that might be madenecessarily stand for all time. He could best put the question by taking a supposititious case, There was in one State of Brazil alarge German majority. Supposing that at some future date themajority said that they wished to be independent of Brazil, andthe Germans said that they proposed to support their compatriots,what action should the League of Nations take? So far as he himself was concerned, he proposed to argue at the Peace Confer-ence that it was not possible to carry to its extreme point the prin-ciple of self-determination. Again, historic Poland includedLithuania. The Lithuanians maintained that their worst enemieswere the Poles. Was the Peace Conference to act on the principle ofmaintaining historic boundaries, or on the principle of self-deter-mination? He himself thought that it would be insanity to in-corporate Lithuania with Poland. His own view was that thereshould be no interference of any sort within the actual boundaries of any State, otherwise it would be impossible to foresee wherethe responsibilities of the League of Nations would end. In thecase of the British Empire there were Egypt and Ireland, both ofwhich countries would certainly claim at the Peace Conference to-be granted their independence. Here, however, it was obviousthat we could not permit outside interference with our owndomestic affairs.Lord Robert Cecil said that a League of Nations would, ofcourse, not be able to deal with every conceivable case. As regardsMr. Balfour&apos;s question, he thought it might be answered in this way.He had cited the case of Egypt, who desired her independence.Supposing the League of Nations decided that this was not a casein which it could interfere, there might, of course, be an insurrec-tion there, and this would have to be quelled; but if an outsidePower, say, Germany, said: &quot;We will support Egypt in herstruggle for independence,&quot; then would be the time for the Leagueof Nations to intervene. The only occasion when the League ofNations would intervene by force would be in order to compeltwo disputant Powers to bring their quarrel for the InternationalCouncil to investigate and settle.Sir Robert Borden said that the purpose of the League ofNations was to prevent war, which in some cases had brought
about the unity and consolidation of kindred peoples into a great power such as Italy for example. He would inquire by whatprocess the League of Nations could accomplish so beneficial a purpose, if it was not to interfere under any circumstances in theinternal affairs of any State.Mr. Hughes said that supposing the question of Ireland came- before the League of Nations, the League would probably wish tosettle it on the basis of a referendum to the Irish people. Thiswould mean, of course, civil war in Ireland. What would be then the position of Great Britain on the one hand, and of the Leagueof Nations, on the other, in regard to the Irish question mr. Lloyd George said that, as Sir Robert Borden had stated,the intention of the League of Nations was to prevent nations fromgoing to war. * In recent times there had been many cases wherenations had gone to war but might have been stopped from doing this had there been a League of Nations to intervene. There wasthe case of France and Italy in 1859, and then there was thequarrel between Bulgaria and Serbia which eventually involvedwar between two Great Powers, Russia and Turkey. Those were two instances in which the League of Nations might have inter-intervened with good effect. As regards Ireland, supposing the americans got so worked up over the Irish question that theydeclared they would stand it no longer, and were about to declarewar1 on Great Britain unless the latter gave Ireland her inde-pendence, the League of Nations would intervene not to settle thequestion of Ireland and to interfere in a domestic question of theUnited Kingdom, but in order to prevent two Great Powers fromgoing to war. &quot;Then take the question of the Great African Empire andthe lynching of negroes, the League of Nations would have theright to step in and discuss that question.Mr. Chamberlain said that it was undoubtedly the case thatCavour forced Italy into the Crimean War in order that italy should have a voice at the Peace Conference. If a League ofNations had been in existence at that time, Italy could have brought the question which affected her before the League.Mr. Churchill said that as long as the Great Powers remainedtogether the League of Nations might work, but the essential weak-nesis of the League was that if two of the Great Powers becameestranged other Powers would have to range themselves on one side or the other. You would then be faced with two groups ofantagonistic interests. For example, to take an extreme case,supposing Great Britain had a difference of opinion with theUnited States over Ireland and the matter assumed great pro-portions, a grouping of the Powers would follow7 and, on a questionof this nature, it would be difficult for the League of Nations to avert war.Further, in his view, a League of Nations could be no sub-stitute for national defences. He believed in a complete andintimate understanding between France, America, and GreatBritain which would be a basis on which a League of Nationscould be erected.Lord Reading said that he was of the opinion that we were asking too much of the League of Nations at the outset. He wanted to suggest that the proposal for a League of Nations should betreated seriously and as something which would lead to the pre-vention of wars in the future, but if you tried at this stage toguard against the causes of future wars the League of nations was doomed to failure. No country would give up her1 completesecurity without knowing how the League of Nations was goingto work. He advocated approaching the question from the generalpoint of view of humanity, that is, that some good should come outof the war.  Once we got into the region of General Smuts&apos; Paper,(5-10- 23] D
with limited armies, &amp;&amp;, there was a danger that the League ofNations would break down owing to too much being expected ofit at the start; everyone would ask what security we had thatGermany, who was authorised to have, say, an army of 100,000,was not saoretly preparing an army of, say, 500,000. Thedifficulties which confronted us with regard to a reduction ofarmaments were great; and if we attempted to solve them, theymight prevent the creation of a League of Nations at all. He didnot think the creation of a League should be dependent on agree-ment with regard to the reduction of armaments.He thought that we should enable President Wilson to go back to the United States and say that although he, PresidentWilson, had not got as much as he wanted with regard to theLeague of Nations, he had at any rate got a starting point.Sir Robert Borden said that in his opinion it was the very strong view of the common people that something should be done to reduce armaments. The people, were under the impression,perhaps an erroneous one, that profit-making in the productionof armaments led to war and was a direct inducement to war,and if we did not take steps to reduce armaments the Peace Con-ference would be a sham.Lord Robert Cecil agreed with this view, and also thoughtsome provision should be made against the private manufacturerof armaments and also against conscription. There was a danger in arriving at a definite scheme for disarmament, as this involved the question of the Freedom of the Seas, and this question was partial disarmament of the naval Powers.Mr. Bonar Law said that unless something definite wasaccomplished in regard to disarmament any discussion on theLeague of Nations would be in the main academic. Marshal Fochhad some time ago expressed to him the view that the futureEuropean countries on the left bank of the Rhine should Organisethemselves, into a combined force to meet any possible danger fromGermany. This was a hopeless point of view, as far as the Leagueof Nations was concerned. In his (Mr. Bonar Law&apos;s) view thequestion of safety was a relative one. If our Navy were reducedbut retained the relative supremacy which it possessed, at thepresent moment we should lose nothing. The same applied toFrance and her army.Mr. Lloyd George said that there appeared to be generalagreement on certain points, firstly in the idea of a League ofNations, and, secondly in the main as to its framework, in whichrespect he thought that Lord Robert Cecil&apos;s proposals were broadlyaccepted. On the question, however, of the power of the League ofNations, there was, if not disagreement, at least considerablehesitation and doubt as to the extent to which it should be carried.On the question of the desirability of the League of Nations, he agreed with Lord Robert Cecil, namely, that if it were not set upas the result of the Peace Conference, there would be profound dis-appointment in this country, and even profound anger. This, he felt sure, was the mind of a people who had suffered and enduredin this war. They regarded with absolute horror the continuanceof a state of affairs which might again degenerate into&apos; such atragedy. Hence any Government that dared to set up a Leagueof Nations that was not real would be sternly dealt with by thepeople, and sooner rather than later. If the League of Nationsdid not include some provision for disarmament it would be re-garded as a sham. Without some check on armaments there wouldbe the greatest disappointment among the people. His plan asregards disarmament would be to tell Germany, Austria, Bulgaria,and Turkey exactly what the size of each of their armies was to be.They would not be conscript armies, and they would be limited towhat was barely necessary for police purposes. If this were done the French people would never stand sending their children into
11 &apos;. IWC 46a conscript army for defence against a shadow. There was noFrench Government .which could induce the people to do so.Hence, if the League of Nations began by the abolition of conscrip-tion in the enemy countries, all the other countries would follow.Disarmament would be regarded as the real test of whether theLeague of Nations was a farce, or whether business was meant.He did not agree with those who considered that the League ofNations would not stop war. In his own lifetime there had beenthree great European wars, namely those Of 1870, 1878, and 1914.In his opinion ail these would have been stopped if a League ofNations such as he contemplated had been in existence. The war of 1870 had been brought on by a trick; there had been a forgedtelegram; if this had been held up for 24 hours no war could have taken place. Similarly in 1878 the war would have been stopped by compelling Serbia not to attack Bulgaria. TheSerbians would have said that the Bulgarian massacres mustcease, and this would have led to an inquiry into the whole matter.Similarly in the case of the present war, Lord Grey proposed a conference; Germany refused. If there had been in existencea regular permanent machinery, Germany could not have refuseda summons to attend. The meeting would have been automatic.Could anyone imagine in those circumstances that the disputewould not have been settled?Mr. Hughes said that the real dispute would never1 have been settled.Mr. Bonar Law said that this depended on armaments.Mr. Hughes said the real causes of the war were racial andeconomic.Mr. Lloyd George said that, at any rate, an obstacle and delay would have been imposed. In regard to the framework, he considered that the Imperial War Cabinet and Versailles wouldprovide admirable precedents. The Imperial War Cabinet con-tained the representatives of the self-governing Dominions andIndia, When questions arose for consideration one or two thingshappened. Either before their arrival in this country the PrimeMinisters had discussed the question with their colleagues, andtherefore knew exactly how far they could go in which case,when they assented to a proposition they knew that it would beagreed to by their own Government or else they said that theymust first discuss it with their colleagues. exactly the same was true of Versailles. The decisions of the Supreme War cabinet had executive force, not because Versailles possessed executive authority, but because its representatives carried the authority oftheir Governments. The authority was not vested in the VersaillesCouncil, but was derived from the Governments represented there.This is what he took General Smuts to mean. This was why hesaid you must isend Ministers with real authority who know the minds of their Governments, and this was the meaning of general smuts&apos; Articles 18 and 19. General Smuts made it quite clearthat nothing would be decided by a majority. If Great Britain 1stood out she could not be compelled by a majority of other nations to agree. He himself had never seen a case at Versailles wherethe parties did not eventually meet and come to some agreement.He quite agreed, however, that in the League of Nations it wouldbe a mistake to attempt too much. It must not be constituted asa body with executive power. But on the basis of the imperial war Cabinet and of the Supreme War Councilyou would get a body whose authority rested with the Governments. Failing this he feared the Peace Conference would be a failure.Mr. Hughes asked Mr. Lloyd George to take note that, as the causes of most wars were ultimately economic, the question of thedecisions of the League of Nations being binding on the BritishEmpire would be a matter of difficulty.
Mr. Lloyd George thought that Mr. Hughes was wrong in thinking that economic questions were the fundamentalcauses of wars. Racial feeling was one great cause, andthis was quite separate from economic considerations, as thecase of Ireland proved. You could not abolish it and it wouldbe fatal to try to do so. You might as well try to abolish family-feeling. He agreed with an observation of Sir Joseph Cook thatin Wales national feeling was as strong as it had been a thousandyears ago. Our aim was to utilise that feeling not for war&apos; butfor the preservation of peace.Mr. Hughes suggested that Mr. Lloyd George underrated thestrength of the feeling of internationalism among the Bolsheviksand their sympathisers.Mr. Lloyd George said the Bolsheviks would be beaten if theytried to suppress racial feelings.Lord Curzon pointed out an essential difference between theproposed League of Nations and the Allied Councils, which mightinvalidate Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s idea that it would always be pos-sible to secure agreement. The Allies had agreed because theyhad a great common object. Yet he recalled that even in their casean admirable proposal for the command and distribution of theAllied naval forces in the Mediterranean had been vetoed by theobstruction of one Italian admiral. In the future League ofNations the common aim would be absent, and you might get a wide divergence of opinion on many questions. Germany and her allies, for example, might urge one point of view, and the Ententenations might take the opposite point of view. How could thetwo standpoints be reconciled?Mr. Llovd George said that he did not accept the proposition that the Allies had always had a common aim. There had beenvery wide differences of opinion between them. For example, inthe case of Turkey the British and French point of view had been entirely different, and yet the Turkish question had been settledamicably. He did not claim that the League of Nations would always end in agreement. There would be many cases comparable with that referred to by Lord Curzon, where the Allies had failedto reach agreement. He thought, however, that even in the caseof the Italian admiral agreement would have been reached if some vital issue had been at stake, but as this was not the case wehad not pressed it. Just so in the case of the League of Nations;many questions would be pushed aside because agreement wasimpossible.Lord Robert Cecil pointed out that many non-contentiousquestions would be settled, and even in the case of the contentiousquestions there would be great advantages in delay.Sir Joseph Cook laid great stress on the principle of relativearmaments.Mr. Montagu urged that the League of Nations must be pressed not merely from the point of view of the United Statesof America, but as an essential from the point of view of theBritish Empire.Mr. Hughes observed that in connection with the develop-ment of the League of Nations, it would be necessary to create ordevelop machinery so that the different parts of the BritishEmpire could express themselves effectively.Mr. Lloyd Geoirge said there was one point he had over-looked in his first statement, and that was that he attached greatimportance to miovable meetings, that is to say that the meetingsof the League of Nations should not necessarily always&apos; be held atthe seat of the secretariat, but in different countries. He thoughtthat if only the leaders of the different nations, could meet itwould make all the difference in international relations.(The Imperial War Cabinet then adjourned.)
2. Lord Lytton, speaking on behalf ol me Admiralty, referred the Imperial War Cabinet to the Admiralty Memorandum on&quot; The Freedom of the Seas &quot; (Paper P.-74), and pointed out thatthis Memorandum naturally discussed the question from the pointof view of our national safety. The British representatives would, however, have to deal at the Inter-Allied Conference withthose who approached it from a different point of view. Withregard to that, much depended on the precise meaning of the phrase &quot;Freedom of the Seas.&quot; If it meant complete freedomof neutral trade from capture or search in war time, which iniact also meant freedom for belligerent trade, that would meanparalysing our sea power. It was unthinkable that we shouldassent to such a conclusion, and if it were forced on us it wouldbecome a dead letter in time of war. In a life-and-death strugglewe should inevitably use any means consistent with the dictates of humanity. It was, therefore, to some modified interpretation of. the phrase that we should have to look for any basis of profitablediscussion. He thought that such discussion would most probablydevelop into an attempt to create a Code of Regulations of Mari-time Warfare in the direction of extending the Regulations of the paris Convention and the London Declaration in the interest neutrals. There were grave naval objections to any such code,more particularly owing to the fact that it would rapidly becomeobsolete, owing to the continuous change in the methods and con-ditions of war. If, however, we were forced to discuss any suchcode, we should have to decide whether we would take our standon our interest as neutrals or on our interest as belligerents. TheAdmiralty considered that we should take our stand on ourbelligerent interest. In any future naval war we could probablyprotect our interest as neutrals by exercising pressure on the bei-ligerents, just as the United States had put pressure on us while they were a neutral Power, and in the last resort it might even be the lesser of two evils to become a belligerent ourselves. On theother hand if we accepted a position which hampered our sea-power in war we should have no remedy.If we were asked to justify our attitude we would point out,firstly that in peace our practice more truly corresponded withthe full freedom of the seas than that of any other Great Power;secondly that our policy in war,had always safeguarded the in-terests of humanity and was in this respect quite opposite to thepolicy pursued by Germany; thirdly that, although the claim weset up undoubtedly involved a set-back from the Declaration ofLondon, as far as the interests of neutrals were concerned, even this was defensible from the point of view of the League ofNations, since it was important that all nations should suffer tosome extent by the outbreak of a war, so that they should all use their best efforts to prevent war breaking out; lastly that theLeague of Nations itself would presumably wish, to use the verypowers that we claim as its most effective weapon if forced to war.Mr. Balfour offered to undertake the part of advocatusdiaboli, in ordeir to put before the Imperial War Cabinet the sort of arguments that might be advanced by President Wilson andothers. He suggested that Lord Lytton&apos;s argument went danger-ously near to asserting that whatever was settled as regards therules of naval warfare, the Admiralty would not be bound bythem. He considered that an argument which should, at any rate,be used with caution. On the general question he pointed outthat we should have to deal with those who would argue that wenot only wished to possess an overwhelming fleet, but also be able in time of war to have an absolute control of the whole oceancommerce of the world: It was not a sufficient answer to thattremendous claim for us to point out that we had never abusedthis power. It would not do to&apos; base rules applicable to all theworld on the national character of a particular belligerent.   It[530-23] E
14was obvious tnat if we and the United States had stood out of thepresent war, Germany would have abused the rules of war to theuttermost. Again, we might be told that we should in any case have these powers when acting as a mandatory of the League ofNations, and that we were therefore claiming, for the single con-contingency of our- being engaged in a war for our own hand, to exer-.cise not only the power of our naval supremacy to keep open these as tor our own troops and commerce and to protect the shoresof cur Empire from invasion, but in addition to this to enjoy the tremendous power of strangling the commerce of others.Mr. Lloyd. George suggested that, instead of attempting to argue the case itself, a proceeding which would still leave bothsides unconvinced, it would be better to make it clear to the Presi-dent that his proposals depended entirely on the League ofNations being a success. It was impossible to ask us at this stage to hand over to the control of the League of Nations powers abso-lutely vital to our existence, though we were ready to let theLeague of Nations give the fullest consideration to the whole sub-ject of the rules of war at sea when it had become a reality, andhad in actual working acquired the confidence of the nations.Lord Curzon pointed out that this fitted in with what SenatorLodge had been saying, with the support not only of the Re-publican majority but also of many Democrats.Mr. Lloyd George remarked that that might possibly pre-judice President Wilson against the argument.- Lord Curzon said that the British Government could not help the fact that a point which they would have had to make in anycase had also been made by Senator Lodge, though he thoughtit would, as a matter of fact, make it much easier for PresidentWilson to get this Peace Treaty through the Senate afterwards.Lord Reading reminded the Imperial War Cabinet that president Wilson was vitally concerned in certain aspects of navalwarfare, and particularly such a question as the use of sub-marines over which he actually went to war. He would naturallywish to be able to go back and sa)r that, on the issue on whichAmerica went to war, he secured a code which settled the question in the American sense. He suggested, therefore, that theAdmiralty might perhaps arrive at a Code of Regulations withregard to such things as submarines and mines which would makethe situation easier for the President than a blank refusal toconsider the whole question at this moment.Lord Curzon thought that that subject was better associatedwith the question of illegitimate methods of warfare generally.Mr. Balfour agreed, however, with Lord Reading that thiswould make President Wilson&apos;s position much easier.The First Sea Lord said that the Admiralty was quite willingto agree to regulations getting rid of the use of submarines andmines in the manner in which they had been employed by the Ger-mans in this war.Lord Lytton saw no objection, from the point of view of theAdmiralty, to Lord Reading&apos;s suggestion being combined withthat of Mr. Lloyd George.The Imperial War Cabinet concurred in the above view.3. With reference to the Report of Mr. Hughes&apos; Committee(P.-38) and Memoranda by the Treasury (P.-46 and P.-46a), Mr.Hughes reminded the Imperial War Cabinet that the Committeewhich had sat under his chairmanship had been appointed to inquire into firstly the economic effects of any indemnity, withregard to which some doubts had been expressed, secondly, theamount of the indemnity and thirdly the mode: of payment. TheCommittee did not consider whether under the&apos; terms of theArmistice we were entitled to ask for an indemnity ait all.  It had
suggested, however, that no just distinction could really be drawn between payment by way of indemnity for the cost of the warand payment by way of reparation for damage done by the enemy to property. The only reason why in paragraph 2 the Reportsaid that reparation should have precedence was in order to in-dicate the urgency of reparation in such cases as that of Belgium,where it meant restoration of property that had been destroyed and of materials that had been taken away.As regards the question of the economic effects of indemnity,they had bad before them the investigations by Professor Ashleyand Mr. Keynes on the French indemnity after the war of 1870,which showed that the receipt of an indemnity by Germany hadnot been harmful to that country, and, broadly speaking, it was more advantageous to be a creditor country and receive an in-demnity than to bear the cost of the war.As regards the question of the amount which Germany couldpay, the evidence before the Committee was of the vaguest ehar-acter. They had had before them business men like Sir C. Addis,,of the Hong Kong Bank, and Mr. Hirst, of the General ElectricCompany, both of whom thought that Germany could pay verylittle indeed, not more than from 60 to 125 million pounds a year.These gentlemen had, however, German interests or associations.On the other hand Lord Cunliffe, as the result of his inquiries in theCity, came to the conclusion that Germany could pay 1,200 millionpounds a year or even more. The 1912 Report of the Dresdner Bankgave some remarkable figures of the rate of German progress. As faras the evidence went, the Committee concluded that it leanedtowards the probability of Germany being able to pay a very sub-stantial amount. The Committee looking at the matter as it wouldbe regarded by a tribunal thought it right to state the amount Ger-many ought to pay, leaving upon the Germans themselves the onusof proving their inability to pay the whole of the sum demanded.It was no use starting out with the assumption that germany could not pay; he did not think that such a view could be takenup1 publicly, it could at most be whispered with bated breath.Our business was not to act as advocates for Germany, butas champions for our own country. If Germany stood inour position she would undoubtedly make us pay to thefull, and we could do it. He quite realised that the matter would have to be referred to an Allied Commission. Xhequestion was, what was to be the attitude of the Empire&apos;s delegateson that Commission? He considered that Germany would have a stable Government, and thought there was no country less likelyto fall under the sway of Bolshevism.Lord Milner suggested that the most certain way of &quot; bol-shevising &quot; Germany would be to put an excessive burden on her.Mr. Churchill asked if Mr. Hughes had investigated theeffects which would be produced upon the ordinary working-classhousehold in Germany by an indemnity? He had reckoned thatthe full indemnity proposed in Mr. Hughes&apos; Report would mean that each household would have to manufacture  85 worth ofgoods for export in. a year over and above sustaining itself.Mr. Hughes replied that the Committee had been more con-cerned in considering the effects upon the working-class householdin. Great Britain, or in Australia, if the Germans did not pay an indemnity. Of course the Germans were human beings and hadto live in the world, but not at other peoples&apos; expense. He onlywanted to give them a spur to constant industry. &apos; A salutarycourse of industry was the best cure for Bolshevism.To sum up, all he wanted was that the instructions to theBritish delegates on the Allied Commission should be to endeavourto secure the greatest possible indemnity which Germany couldpay,without damage to our own finances and industries andwithout danger to the peace of the world,[530-23] F
Mr. Montagiu1 asked Mr. Hughes how the indemnity could beexacted without an army of occupation, a point on which his report ha.d laid special emphasis?Mr. Hughes replied that the circumstances were such thatthe economic and financial pressure which we could apply would compel Germany to pay, providing she had the capacity to do so.If she did not have that capacity even an army of occupation couldnot get it from her.The Prime Minister thought that the instructions should ceT-tainly include a proviso that the collection of indemnity shouldnot only not involve economic injury to the Empire or create a menace to the peace of the world, but should also not require anarmy of occupation for its collection.Mr. Long reminded the Imperial War Cabinet of the factthat Mr. Hughes&apos; Committee had been required to present its Re-port in a very few days. His own conclusion as a member of theCommittee had been that no one could give any information reallyworth having as to Germany&apos;s capacity to pay. But the fact that men of such standing in the business world as Lord Cunliffe andMr. Gibbs were emphatic in their belief that a large indemnitycould be imposed, and that similar conclusions had also been arrivedat in the Reports of the Federation of British Industries and the associated Chambers of Commerce, would create a very awkwardsituation if the Government did not press its full demands inaccordance with the cost of the war to ourselves. This would be without prejudice to fuller information disclosing reasons for modifying that demand.Sir Robert Borden concurred in the view expressed by theCommittee, that Germany, subject to the considerations just men-tioned, which in his mind were controlling considerations, should pay a full indemnity. He agreed that it would be for thepeace of the world that a Power which had broken that peaceshould be punished. On the other hand if the Report really wasa statement of what Germany was in fact capable of paying, he did not find it convincing and was not prepared to concur in it.If one applied its conclusions to the ca.se of Canada, which hadabout one-eighth of the population which would be left to Ger-many after the loss of Alsace-Lorraine and Posen, one would find that Canada would have to pay an indemnity of 150 million poundsa year over and above the cost of maintaining the government ofthe country and developing its resources. Even with the enormousnatural resources which Canada had in proportion to-her. popula-tion. that would be impossible. He doubted if Canada could payeven one-tenth of that amount.Sir George Foster said that the Committee was appointedto report to the Imperial War Cabinet, and he thought for thepurpose of enabling the Imperial War Cabinet the better to reach a decision about the matter afterwards. He was under the im-pression the Report would not be made public. Such a Com-mittee had not the time nor the sources of information at its disposal to enable it to determine what Germany could pay with-out injury to her or to us. There were three sources of evidence available to the Committee in regard to the capacity of Germanyto pay: a Report of the Board of Trade; the evidence of Mr.Hirst, who estimated that Germany could pay 125 million poundsannually; and that of Sir Charles Addis, who estimated that Ger-many could pay from 60 to 65 million pounds annually. Apart from such evidence the Report of the Committee was based on the opinions of its members, framed in each case on such informationas each possessed. He had signed the Report subject to certainprotests, in order to expedite its consideration by the imperial war Cabinet. He agreed with the Report so far as it was infavour of presenting a bill for the total cost of the war to theparties which had wrongfully originated and carried on the war.
This would be a helpful lesson to mankind. He was in favour of reparation plus indemnity the one grew out of the other. Weshould first have reparation and then indemnity. Germany shouldbe made to pay to the last farthing, with the proviso that regardmust be had to her capacity to pay and to the effect of the modeof payment of the indemnity on the economic interests of theAllies. But when an attempt was made to fix the precise amount which could be extracted from the enemy Powers, then examina-tion must be made by some commission with more informationthan was in the possession of the Committee.Mr. Bonar Law said he did not object to our taking the line that we wanted Germany to pay up to her capacity, but he wouldhave protested if the intention had been to ask for the Cabinetto agree to the suggestion that the obtaining from Germany ofany such -sum) as mentioned in the report was possible. he did not agree with the view that President Wilson mightnot urge that we were not dealing fairly with his four-teen points in this matter. If on examination it was found thatall Germany was able to.pay was what would cover reparation,then it was foolish to quarrel about indemnities. On the 2ndDecember they had agreed with the Allies apart from the UnitedStates to appoint an Inter-Allied Commission to examine whatGermany could pay. Until they knew the result of that enquirywhy should they raise the question of principle?Mr. Lloyd George said that he did not think it could be argued that President Wilson had ruled out indemnities. It wasin his speeches and was covered by his use of the term reparation.President Wilson had contended that international disputesshould be governed by the legal and moral principles applicable to private disputes. When claims are put forward against a defen-dant in a court of law you did not put forward costs as one of theclaims. As a rule costs follow the event. In the next place, inany discussion with the President, it was important to remember that we had been fighting for four and a half years, whereas theUnited States had had to bear the cost of only a year1 and a halfof war. The United Kingdom, Canada, and the other Dominions,were crippled by the additional cost of the extra three years of fighting. Unless President Wilson was prepared to pool the whole cost of the war, and for the United States to take its share of thewhole, he was not in a position to reject our claims for indemnity.As regards the figure of 24,000 million pounds he did notbelieve that that sum could be obtained.Mr. Hughes said he agreed that it might not be possible toget that sum. But it was not for us to limit our demand, but forGejrmany to prove to our satisfaction that she could not pay allthat she ought to do.Mr. Lloyd George continuing, said he understood the Germandebt was between 6 and 7,000 million pounds, and the annualcharge on ft about 300 millions, which she would have to pay toher investors. In his view. Germany&apos;s debt to us should be a first charge on her resources, and the payment of interest on her own ,national debt should come after our&apos; claims had been met.Subject to the above considerations, he was in favour of appointing three delegates as members of the proposed Inter-Allied Commission. They should find out what Germany couldpay without damage to us. He suggested that the instructionsto the delegates should be: - To endeavour to secure from Germany the greatest possibleindemnity she can pay consistently with the economicwell-being of the British Empire and the peace of theworld, and without involving an army of occupation inGermany for its collection.Mr. Barnes expressed the opinion that the insistence on an
is.indemnity was an afterthought, and the representations wehad made to President Yv ilson were in the sense of reparation for damage done. He, Mr. Barnes, had no idea that the Government were going to ask for1 any indemnitybeyond that. To suggest that we intended to exact an indemnity on the immense scale proposed would have theundesirable effect of exciting pity for the German people.Further, if an impossible bill were presented it would carry with it priority of claim to payment; that would mean that Belgiumwould be paid in full and that probably we ishould not be paid at all. All were agreed that the damage done in Belgium came under reparation, but not all the damage done in France. he supported the claim to reparation in the literal sense, and wouldmake it cover all material damage in Belgium, in France, to our ships and for all the seamen who had been drowned by submarines.They ought to present a bill that Germany could pay and then there was a chance of all the creditors obtaining their proper share.Mr. Lloyd George did not think that the conclusion drawn byMr. Barnes necessarily followed. We might insist on reparationbeing dealt with first, and in that way we should come in for our share with Belgium and France.Sir Robert Borden said that President Wilson in his 14points spoke of reparation and nothing else and thus by duplication-tion excluded indemnities. We had spoken of compensation for damage done, but even that was confined to invaded and occupied territories. If President Wilson should put this contention for-ward to the Prime Minister and Mr. Balfour what answer couldthey make?Mr. Bonar LaAv suggested that they could point to the greatdeal of feeling which prevailed in this country on the subject.He, however, hoped they would not discuss the matter&apos; further,but wait for the reply of the Inter-Allied Commission. He knewof no way of obtaining payment except by gold, securities, and exports, noir did he see a way of our getting more than reparationwithout being damaged ourselves.Mr. Lloyd George, in reply to a question from Mr. Montagu,,said that while they had spoken during the discussion of Germanyonly, they did not, of course, exclude the other enemy Powers.The Imperial War Cabinet accepted the instructions to theBritish delegates at the Inter-Allied Commission onReparation and Indemnities as proposed by Mr. LloydGeorge, namely: To endeavour to secure from Germany the greatest;possible indemnity she can pay consistently with theeconomic well-being of the British Empire and ifche peace of the world, and without involving an army of oocupa-tion in Germany for its collection.Date of future 4. Mr. Lloyd George, in reply to Mr. Hughes, said it was -Meetings. difficult to fix the date of further meetings in London or in Franceuntil he had seen President Wilson. The date that had beensuggested for the beginning of the Inter-Allied Conference hadbeen the 6th or 7th January, but that was before President wilson had altered his plans. He hoped, however, that members of theImperial War Gabinet would be in London and available on saturday the 28th instant.2, Whitehall Gardens,London, S.W.1.o
