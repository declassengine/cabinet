THE ATTITUDE OF THE ALLIES TOWARDS THE EX-KAISER.MR. LLOYD GEORGE explained to the Allied Representatives that theImperial War Council, at which India and the Dominions were represented, hadbeen discussing, among other subjects, the question of the best way to deal withthe ex-Kaiser.M. CLEMENCEAU said that the question, in his opinion, should remain openuntil an official talk could take place between all the Governments concerned.PAYMENT BY THE ENEMY OF REPARATION AND INDEMNITY.MR. LLOYD GEORGE said that two drafting corrections were necessary inthe decisions reached on the previous day. It was proposed to ask for indemnityas well as reparation. Further, in the document addressed to President Wilson,the word &quot; surrender &quot; was suggested as a substitute for the word &quot; extradition.&quot;(These amendments were accepted!) .REPRESENTATION OF SMALL NATIONS AT THE PEACECONFERENCE,.M. CLEMENCEAU asked that the decision relating to the right of smallnations to explain their case at the Peace Conference should be read.(The decision was read by Mr. Lloyd George. M. Clemenceau made no comment.)&apos; ALLIED COMMISSION IN THE ADRIATIC.The Secretary drew the attention of the meeting to a decision of the previous evening concerning the commission of four admirals to deal with the situation inthe Adriatic.   This decision had not been finally accepted.(Mr. Lloyd George read the decision, which, after consideration by the Italianrepresentatives, was accepted.)REPRESENTATION OF DOMINIONS AND INDIA.MR. HUGHES said that he wished to ask a question concerning sub-para-graph (c) of Clause 4 of I.C.-98 (a) relating to the representation of the Dominions.He wished to know what was the exact interpretation of that clause. For instance,the question of raw material affected Australia.(It was generally agreed that on a question of this character Australia shouldbe represented)MR. LLOYD GEORGE said that he wished  to add India to the other -Dominions.    He pointed out that India had raised a million men for the war, anddeserved to be represented.;(This was accepted)ARMY OF OCCUPATION IN GERMANY.MR. LLOYD GEORGE then invited Marshal Foch to explain the situationconcerning the Army of Occupation in Germany. In respect to the Allied forcesoccupying territories belonging to the Austro-Hungarian dual Kingdom, he would at a later stage ask Signor Orlando to open the subject, and Sir Henry Wilson tocontinue it.MARSHAL FOCH explained that the regime on the Western Front was inaccordance with the conditions laid down in the Armistice bn the 11th November.To occupy the left bank of the Rhine and the Rhinelands, a total of 41 allied divisions was to be employed. Of these, 17 were French, 11 British, 9 American,and 4 Belgian. This force was adequate, should the enemy show any intention ofrenewing hostilities, to defend the line of the Rhine and to cross it if necessary,
These dispositions were to last until the signature of the Peace Treaty. After the signature of the preliminaries of peace, occupation might have to continue in order,to ensure the fulfilment of the conditions of the treaty. The force could, no doubt,,be reduced, but there were many unknown data both respecting the length of oceu-paition that might be required and the extent of territory it might be advisable to occupy. In this occupation presumably all the Allies would take a share; thatwas, all the Allies who had fought on the Western Pront. Among the french divisions it must be understood that&apos; Italian elements who had fought on that frontwould be included. What proportional share the Allies were to take in this furtheroccupation he could not say. For instance, he did not know whether the american army was to remain in Europe. It was not possible, therefore, at the present time,to say how many divisions each Ally would be expected to contribute. But he could say approximately what total would be required. He thought that it would be wise to keep thirty Allied divisions on the Rhine and in the Rhinelands to thewest of it, for one year after the signature of Peace. He said this without pre-judging what might be the state of Germany at that time.MR. LLOYD GEORGE enquired whether this estimate took into account an occupation of German provinces with a view to the collection if an indemnity ?MARSHAL FOCH replied that he was not considering that. His proposal was for one year. What further necessities might result from the conditions ofthe Peace Treaty he was not able to say. In order to reach a conclusion, as therewere a number of uncertain data in the situation, he would ask that the Govern-ments most interested should depute a military authority to concert with him, and,in the case of Great Britain, that Sir Henry Wilson should be authorised to&apos; settlethese questions with him as they arose.SIR HENRY WILSON said that he had no comment to make 6n MarshalFochs statement, except that it would appear that the British divisions were boundto increase or decrease according to the action of the American army. Should theAmerican army withdraw, their place would have to be filled by other Allied troops.He asked whether Marshal Foch had any knowledge of American intentions?MR. LLOYD GEORGE said that the Americans would surely take their share.SIR ROBERT BORDEN asked whether the divisions would all be of the samestrength?MARSHAL FOCH replied that they would be approximately of the samestrength. Although the American divisions had more infantry, they had lessartillery, and the French had to help them in guns.MR. BARNES enquired how many men would be required for the british share in the occupation?SIR HENRY WILSON estimated the number at 300,000, including lines ofcommunication, port authorities, etc.MARSHAL FOCH agreed with this estimate.BARON SONNINO enquired whether Marshal Foch had any knowledge of american intentions.MARSHAL FOCH replied that he had hone.The following decision was then agreed to:The British Government agreed to the proposal of Marshal Foch that the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff should confer with the Marshal in regard tothe detailed arrangements for the British portion of the Army of Occupa-tion of German territory.MILITARY OCCUPATION OF AUSTRIA.SIGNOR ORLANDO said that he had no military adviser with him, and thatthe question was a technical one. He would, therefore only express his views ingeneral terms. There were two Fronts in connection with Austria; one, the italian front, and the other that of the Salonica force. , As to the latter he could say nothing.
He would further point out that there were great differences between the Austrian,and the German Armistice. In the former the pursuit of an offensive against Ger-many, through Austro-Hungarian territory had been considered. In the latter,,strategical guarantees had been the main consideration. There was no occupationof Austro-Hungarian territory, with the exception of Innsbruck, on the same lines asin Germany. Marshal Foch could perhaps say whether it was desirable to maintaintroops in Innsbruck or not. As to the number of troops Italy should keep mobilised,he would also defer to the Marshall opinion. Fighting on the Italian Front therehad been 53 Italian, 3 British, and 2 French divisions, and 1 American regiment. As.to the last, the American Military Attache had expressed a desire to withdraw it,but this intention had not as yet been carried out, and Signor Orlando said that he hoped it would not be.MARSHAL FOCH asked what proportion of these troops had crossed the oldItalian frontier.SIGNOR ORLANDO said that he did not know, but thought that nearly halfhad crossed the frontier. : .SIR HENRY WILSON said that he had one or two observations to make. Theterms of the Armistice with Austria differed from those with Germany, because no-guarantees were required. The Austro-Hungarian Army was demobilised, the roumanians were taking over Transylvania, the Czechs Bohemia, and the Jugo-Slavs,.in collaboration with the Serbs, were forming a new State in the South.. He had heard, however, that the Italian Government were forming four armies to move into german Austria. Innsbruck also was being occupied, and the occupation of Laibachwas being considered. General Franchet d&apos;Esperey had been asked to occupy bothBuda-Pesth and Vienna. Sir Henry Wilson was informed that M. Clemenceau hadriot agreed to this. He wished to know whether the occupation of Austria was to beInter-Allied, or Italian, on the one side, and French on the other. The answer tothis question affected the strength of British garrisons in that part of the world.So far, only one British Battalion from Lord Cavan&apos;s force had been employed for occupation at Fiume, and another was in preparation to go to Innsbruck. FromGeneral Milne&apos;s force a brigade was to go to Bucharest.SIGNOR ORLANDO said that he believed, although he was not sure, that theCommander-in-Chief had objected to. an advance into Austria-Hungary. As faras the Italian Government was concerned, he had no intention, for political reasons,to occupy any part of Austro-Hungarian territory. . Should the Commander-in-Chief, for military reasons, require troops, Italian troops would be lent-to him. Asto the four armies mentioned by Sir Henry Wilson, he knew nothing of them.Possibly they had been formed with a view to an offensive against Germany from theSouth while that was still regarded as a possibility. The question to him appeared to-be only a military one. From the political point of view, Italy did not desire to occupy any part of Austro-Hungarian territory.The following decision was then agreed to: The British, French and Italian Governments agreed that the arrangements forthe military occupation of Austria, as provided for in the Austrian Armis-tice, were primarily a military question for arrangement between the ItalianCommander-in-Chief and General Franchet d&apos;Esperey. The military pro-posals, when formulated, should be submitted to the Governments concerned,through Marshal Foch.REPRESENTATION OF RUSSIA AT THE PEACE CONFERENCE.MR. LLOYD GEORGE proposed that the meeting should consider the questionof Russian representation, and of the Allied attitude towards Russia, at the PeaceConference.   He asked Mr. Balfour to express his views on the subject.MR. BALFOUR said that, in regard to the treaties entered into by Russia sincethe Revolution, such as the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, the British Government had never recognised them. It was necessary to come to some conclusion as to the repre-sentation of Russia and of the fractions of previously Russian territory which had formed themselves, or wished to form, themselves, into separate States. There wasalso the question of Siberia. He thought it. could safely be said that all desired tosee Russia re-constituted in some manner; in other words, that there should be a stable and coherent Russia in some manner comparable to the Russia that existed before the
554war. But he thought that no one could wish that her boundaries should be the sameas before; for instance, Finland could not be included within them. Finland had been much ill-used by Russia in the past, and, though the Allies had little reason to besatisfied with the conduct of Finland in the last year, it could not be our policy to deliver Finland to her former yoke. Much the same applied to the smaller nationalitiesin the North-West. The populations there were, by education, far in advance of the populations of Central Russia, from whom they differed in race, in religion, and&quot; in language. They had not hitherto been able to develop their nationality in consequenceof the pressure of Russia on the one side, and of Germany on the other. The FrenchGovernment had already acknowledged the Finnish Government, and Mr. Ballourfelt that the time must come when Great Britain would have to follow suit. Theother Governments of Esthonia, Livonia, etc., had not been recognised, but sympathy and good wishes had been expressed, and they had been led to suppose that their case would be considered at the Peace Conference.MR. LLOYD GEORGE asked whether all these States desired independence.MR. BALFOI7R said that at the present time they did. They were afraid ofRussia in its present form, and had the bitterest recollections of the &quot;former Russianbureaucracy, which had protected the German Barons along the Baltic. TheseGerman Barons would doubtless have to be bought out, or driven out. In all thesecases he thought that we should have to support the plea for independence, with aproviso that, with the advent of better conditions in Russia, these States could, attheir own option, enter into a Federal union with her. The case of the U kraine was particularly difficult. It was to a large extent an artificial State, created by austria and German Professors. Its population did not differ noticeably in race, religionor language, from that of Central Russia! The territories of the Don doubtlessought to be Russian. Trans-Caucasia, however, should not. The Georgians, Arme-nians, and Tartars were not Russian, and did not desire to become Russian subjectsagain. The peace would have to be kept in those regions, but not by Russia, who had previously enforced peace tyrannically and corruptly. He thought, therefore, thatwe could not say that we meant to restore the original Russia. The case ofTurkestan was analogous to the case of Trans-Caucasia, but, owing to its proximity to Afghanistan and India, was of special interest to Great Britain. If that were a correct estimate of the situation, how was Russia to be represented at the Conference?Some Russians of distinction wished to have a locus standi, but they had no title torepresent the present Russia. So little title had they that they could not returnto the country except at the risk of their lives. They could doubtless, in private,give the statesmen of the Allied countries information regarding Russia, and theirviews on the, subject, but they could not be regarded as representative; nor could wehave Bolshevik representatives. There were, however, other Governments inRussia. There was one at Omsk, one under General Denekin in South-East Russia,and one at Archangel and on the shores of the Arctic Ocean under Allied protection.These Governments had not coalesced, though they might wish to do so, as their existence was very precarious, and they were separated from one another by very con-siderable distances. Mr. Balfour was, therefore, unable to advise the Conference to admit any representatives of Russia as such. Representatives of Finland and other small nations should appear in the qualifiel manner agreed on previously. To these might be added representatives of the small Governments he had just mentioned.BARON SONNINO asked whether it was not premature to rule out Russia. Amonth would elapse before the Conference met, and. Russia was in revolution. It wasin the common interest that Russia should exist. He did not necessarily mean by this a unitary Russia, but possibly a Federation of autonomous States. A collection of verysmall and mutually hostile States would give Germany a chance of creating the same kind of trouble that had disturbed Europe in the Balkans. If it were decidel thatthe larger Russia was not to appear at the Peace Conference, but that small fractionsof it should be admitted, the meeting would be promoting the centrifugal contagionthat was spreading through Europe. Not only would small States, but possibly eventowns, ask for autonomy. Pie thought that assistance shoud be given to the various governments forming in Russia, and that sympathy should be shown in order topromote the creation of a future Federation of Russian States. The feeling in thecountries in question was rather against the systems of Government prevalent inRussia to-day and in the past than against Russia as such. His conclusion, there-fore, was that it was premature to decide this matter finally at once.[1070-5] . C
M. CLEMENCEAU said, that the art of politics was to solve problems as theyarose. He did not expect to settle anything for eternity at the present meeting.In general, -he agreed with Mr. Balfour. He would resist with the greatest energyany representation of Russia, which had betrayed the-Allied cause during the war.The peace which was to be settled did not concern her. As to our attitude to thesmall nations, and their attitude towards us, our peace policy would be the deter-mining factor. If we made a just peace they would, be attracted to us. If were-established a world of rival coalitions, we should produce among them the sametroubles that had brought about this war. We were not bound to recognise the smallnations at once; to use a colloquial phrase: &quot; let them cook,&quot; and when they appearedready we should recognise them.MR. LLOYD GEORGE said that, as America was not represented at the meet-ing, he felt that it was in any case premature to make any decision on the subject ofRussia. Nioi recommendation should be made now. It was not premature, however,to discuss the matter in order to ascertain the feeling on the subject. He himselffelt that we could not proceed as if there were no Russia. He admitted that ifany of the Allies were answerable for bringing about the war, Russia was the one.Russia also had been the first to go out. But.it must be recognised that, great asihad been the sufferings of the other Allies, Russia had probably lost more lives than any. Their troops had fought without arms or munitions; they had been outrage-ously betrayed by their Government, and it was little to be wondered at if, in theirbitterness, the Russian people had rebelled against the Allies. He doubted whether any other country would have borne as much as Russia and remained in the war.Russia, after all, represented something like two-thirds of Europe and a large partof Asia. It was a problem that must be faced. Could it be faced without givingthe Russian people a right to present their case? The affairs of nearly two hundredmillion people could not be settled without hearing them. It was not possible to saythat the Tartars, the Finns, the Letts, should come to the Peace Conference and notthe Bolsheviks, who stood far1 two-thirds of the whole population. The.Bolsheviks,whatever might be thought of them, appeared to have a hold over the majority ofthe population. This was a fact, a sinister one no doubt, and facts could not beneglected because they were sinister. He reminded the meeting that 120 years agosimilar feelings had been experienced, and similar views had been expressed in that very room, with Mr. Pitt, whose portrait was hanging on the walls, in the Chair, inregard to the French revolutionaries, and the dissidents in Vendee and in the southof France. He, therefore, strongly deprecated the adoption of any fixed attitudetowards Central Russia.SIR ROBERT BORDEN drew attention to Conclusion 4, sub-paragraph (e) ofI.C. 98 A., in which the term &quot; embryo nations &quot; was used. If this term applied toEsthonia and the Jugo-Slavs, did it not equally apply to the various governments in Russia, for instance Siberia and the Bolsheviks themselves]MR. BALFOUR pointed out that the inclusion of the Bolsheviks presenteddifficulties. The Prime Minister had given good reasons for their inclusion, but thefact that we were at war with them was a not inconsiderable obstacle. They impri-soned our representatives, and we expelled theirs. The Scandinavian nations were about to break off relations with them.LORD CURZON said that two questions were perhaps being confused. Theresolution quoted by Sir Robert Bioirden referred to Inter-Allied Conferences. Thematter at present being dealt with was the Peace Conference, in which the allies would- have to meet the enemy. No one could, say the Bolsheviks were among theAllies, but it might be maintained that they found a place among the enemy.It was generally agreed that no conclusion could usefully be reached in regardto the representation of Russia at the Inter-Allied Conference or Peace Conferencein the absence of any representative of the Government of the United States ofAmerica.INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS, LABOUR, AND OTHER CONFERENCES.MR. BARNES said that the Inter-Allied Labour Conference held in thiscountry and the similar Conference held in Paris had passed resolutions in favourof an International Labour and Socialist Conference being held at the same place
-and time as the Peace Conference, in order to exercise what influence they could onthe peace discussions. Their request had been put&apos;to the British and French PrimeMinisters. The Governments had to choose between two evils. If they permitted theConference, it would attract to it all sorts of&apos;doctrinaires--and extremists; if they refused permission, agitation against the Government would be fomented in each-country. .MR. PIUGHES said that there were two points which required to be cleared up, first, Labour representation at the Peace Conference, and, secondly, the holding-of an International Labour Conference.MR. LLOYD GEORGE said that the former was not the point at present underdiscussion.M. CLEMENCEAU said&apos;that he had received deputations from the FrenchFederation of Trade Unions, and from the Socialist Group in the French Parliament.They had put these questions- to him: Would the French Government agree to an Inter-Allied Labour and1 SocialistCongress, or would they agree to an International Congress, which would include German Socialists, to be held at the same time and place as thePeace Conference, or to be held elsewhere. In the latter case would theygrant the necessary passports?To this he had replied that it was impossible to permit such a Conference meet-ing at the same time and place as the Peace Conference, because such an arrange-ment would be sure to lead to undesirable public demonstrations. But the FrenchGovernment would offer no obstacle to the holding of a Labour Conference outsideFrance, and would grant passports and facilities for that purpose.He thought this would avoid the hostility which would be caused by the refusal of passports, and he saw no great objection to Germans being present at the LabourConference.   In his view their attendance was not likely to increase its prestige.With regard to the relations which should exist between the two Conferences,he had said that it would not be possible to admit of the Labour Conference beingrepresented at the Peace Conference. It would not be right to give preferential treatment to the industrialists of the towns over against the agricultural interests.He recognised that the Peace Conference could not come to an end without dealingwith Labour problems, and it should be open to- Labour organisations to make repre-sentations in writing and possibly by deputation.He had replied, further, that they could only submit for consideration mattersdealing with labour, and he had been asked to raise with the Allied Governments thequestion of allowing the Labour Conference to discuss problems other than labour.He had agreed to do so if the request were put in writing, but up to the present nosuch request had reached him.MR. HUGHES thought it would be a very false step if labour questions were discussed at the Peace Conference. The Peace Conference was an unsuitable body for such a purpose. It was not too much to say that if an International LabourConference were summoned and were asked what sort of Government they wouldlike to live under, its spokesman would decree a world not much unlike the worldnow under Bolshevik rule. If the Labour people wished to urge the Allies to belenient to Germany and to have no economic war, let them put their views in writing,like any. other sectional interest. It would be fatal to give them any greater privilegesthan were enjoyed by other citizens represented at the Peace Conference.BARON SONNINO said he could not on this matter speak in the name of theItalian Government, but speaking for himself he agreed with Mr. Hughes. Peaceshould be made by Governments and heads of States. No particular class or sectionshould have a separate voice. It would be very dangerous if they allowed specialrepresentation to be made on the basis of religion, sex, or interest. The PeaceConference must be run by Governments. If special regulations dealing with international labour were to&apos; be drawn up, they could be dealt with by the Leagueof Nations.MR. LLOYD GEORGE said he gathered that M. Clemenceau was against allowing the Labour Conference to&apos; be held anywhere in France.MR. BARNES said that he understood Mr. Gonipers and three colleagues had started, or were about to start, for the Labour Conference.
M. CLEMENCEAU said that the art of politics was to solve problems as theyarose. He did not expect to settle anything for eternity at the present meeting.In general, -he agreed with Mr. Balfour.

BARNES said that he understood Mr. Gompers and three colleagues had started, or were about to start, for the Labour Conference.
M. ORLANDO said that he wished if it were possible not to&apos; have a meeting:of the Labour Conference simultaneously with the Peace Conference. The repre-sentatives of the former would maintain that they spoke for the people and thatbhoir conception of the peace was the only just one. On the other hand, at thePeace Conference questions of great interest to labour would be certain to come up They had agreed that a Commission of financial experts would be required^Why should not the Governments at the Peace Conference be similarly assisted by labour experts? Large problems connected with reconstruction and the movementof labour between States would be sure to arise at the Peace Conference, and inhis opinion the Governments should have recourse to labour advisers analogous tothe military and financial experts.MR. LLOYD GEORGE said that the question of labour experts was reallyanother problem. With regard to the holding of the Labour Conference he was certain public opinion would not tolerate the holding of the Conference in thiscountry if Germans were to be present. He thought it dangerous to admit theclaim of the industrialists to exercise authority co-ordinate with that of a Govern-ment If the industrialists wish a Socialist Government they can vote for ona ata General Election. The furthest we ought to go is to say that the Governmentwould put no obstacle in the way of the holding of an International Conference.MR. BALFOUR said it was important not to restrict their decision to labourconferendes. There had, for example, been application for permission to holdreligious conferences.The following decision was then agreed to&apos;:The British, French, and Italian Governments agreed that they will placeno obstacle in the way of an international labour, religious, or any o-herconference being held, provided that, until Peace is signed, it is held in a neutral country.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,December 4, 1918.
