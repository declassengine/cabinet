2Condition of 1. THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff, who had recentlyBelgium. returned from Belgium, reported that the Allied advance was going on according to programme. The Germans were fallingback in good order, leaving the villages, roads, and railwaysintact. At Lille a good deal of damage had been done to railroad and bridges, but in all probability the damagehad occurred before the armistice. General Wilson said thathe had been present during the King of the Belgians&apos;entry into Brussels. The demonstration given in His Majesty&apos;shonour was remarkable, and the populace were mad with joy.The reception accorded to the Red Ensign on the car in which theChief of the Imperial General Staff was driving was wonderful. &quot;The people all appeared to be in good health; they were wellclothed and well shod; and the children, of whom there were thou-sands present, all looked well. The state of the shops was sur-prisingly good. In the flower-shops there were orchids,carnations, and roses, and in the sweet-shops an abundance ofgood things. An excellent meal was to be obtained at less pricethan would have been the case in Paris. At Louvain, on the otherhand, the women and children appeared not to be so robust, butthat was the only town in which the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff had observed the people not to be looking well. Here, too,were traces of the damage which had taken place four years pre-viously. The big Library was gone, and the Cathedral and someof the streets were a good deal knocked about.In this connection, Mr. Chamberlain urged that the british representatives at the Peace Conference should press for the inclu-sion of provisions in the Peace Treaty for replenishing the LouvainLibrary from German sources.Visit of Allied 2. The Prime Minister mentioned that he had invited ColonelRepresentatives to    House and Signor Orlando to come to London on the followingoncon&apos; Sunday, when M. Clemenceau was due to arrive.   He stated thathe had also invited Marshal Foch to accompany M. Clemenceau.He had spoken to M. Tardieu on the previous day, and had pressedhim to urge M. Clemenceau to bring Marshal Foch with him. Inthe event of acceptance, he hoped that a military reception couldbe arranged.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff undertook to com-municate with Marshal Foch, urging him to come, and inthe event of Marshal Foch coming he agreed to inviteField-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig to be present also.The Prime Minister requested the members of the imperial war Cabinet to be available in London on Monday, Tues-day, and Wednesday next, December 2, 3, and 4, . inconnection with the conferences with the Allied represen-tatives.Esthonia. 3  With reference to War Cabinet 502, Minute 5, Appendix(8), whereby it had been decided to supply the Baltic States with military material if and when they have Governments ready toreceive and utilise such material, the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff asked for the authority of the Cabinet in regard to sendingrifles and machine-guns, which were now ready, to the Esthonians.It was poin ed out that the question turned on whether a rightGovernment to receive the arms existed! The ostensible purposeof sending the rifles was to guard against Bolshevism ; but it wouldbe a disastrous policy, in the present state of confusion in the baltic states, for His Majesty&apos;s Government to interfere between Germanlandowners and the Esthonian population.
3IWC 38thatIn these circumstances the Imperial War Cabinet decidedThe rifles and machine-guns should be shipped at once, butnot delivered to the Esthonians until the receipt of specificorders from the War Cabinet.Captured german submarines.4. With reference to War Cabinet 504, Minute 3 (a), whereby the Board of Admiralty had been instructed to make arrangementsfor distributing the captured German submarines among the prin-cipal seaports in this country, the First Lord asked whether hewas to do this without waiting for the consent of the Allies andtheir views as to distribution among them also.The Imperial War Cabinet decided that Submarines should be distributed and exhibited  in british ports forthwith, without awaiting any formal agreement by the Allies for their distribution.Reconstruction of belgian Ports.5. The Imperial War Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby Sir Eric Geddes (Paper G.Tr-6365), on the subject of the re-construction of Belgian ports, but, owing to the unavoidableabsence of Mr. Balfour, it was decided that The Foreign Office should be asked to report before&apos;the ques-tion was again considered by the Cabinet.Representation atPeace Conference.6. Owing to the absence of the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, it was decided that -The consideration of Lord Derby&apos;s telegram with reference torepresentation at the Peace Conference, and of a Note byGeneral Smuts on the same subject, should be postponed.The german colonies.7. Mr. Long said that the Governor-General of New zealand had cabled asking that his Prime Minister might be allowed tostate in Parliament that each Dominion was to present at thePeace Conference its own case for the retention of German colonies.Sir Robert Borden entirely agreed that South Africa, Aus-tralia, and New Zealand should each put forward its case for theretention of German colonial possessions conquered in the war.Further, he was of opinion that a carefully prepared memorandum setting forth general considerations controlling or affecting thequestion would be useful.It was pointed out that, while it was the view of the BritishGovernment that each Dominion should present its own case, thefinal; acceptance of such a proposal must rest with the AlliedPowers.In these circumstances; the Imperial War Cabinet decidedthat The request of the Governor-General must, for the time being,be refused. &apos; -     .&apos; Freedom of these as.&quot;[530-17]- 8. Sir Robert Bbrden said that he was not at all clear as towhat President Wilson meant by the expression &quot; Freedom of these as,&quot; and especially as to what the expression was intended to mean in time of peace. He understood that a very full and ex,-haustive Memorandum was being prepared on the question.B 2 /
The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that in some quarters the expression was interpreted as meaning the &apos;&apos; Freedomof the Seas under the British Flag,&quot; but he was doubtful if theUnited States would take this view. He referred to a speech which had been made in London by Admiral Sims, giving thisview, the gist of which had been telegraphed to the United States.Lord R. Cecil and he thought that the publication of this speech in the United States would have led to considerable criticism pos-sibly to the recall of the Admiral1 but it had not done so. Mr.Roosevelt was determined to get President Wilson to define what he meant by &quot; Freedom of the Seas.&quot;Lord Reading confirmed this view.Mr. Hughes said, that there was a great divergence of opinon as to the interpretation of the expression &quot; Freedom of the Seas.&quot;He further pointed out that the Allied Powers had agreed to go tothe Peace Conference with a free hand, and suggested that ItabTand France, and possibly other Powers, would support GreatBritain&apos;s policy, but, of course, this was not certain.The Prime Minister said that &quot; Freedom of the Seas,&quot; in theactual practice of the United Kingdom, included the absohitefreedom of coastal trade.9. Sir Robert Borden said that the attitude at the Peace Con-ference of the British Empire on all important questions ought tobe determined by discussion in the Imperial War Cabinet, so faras there was any room for debate. Then might follow a discussion between the representatives of the important Allied nations, in-cluding the United States, as to the peace terms which should be proposed, or, rather, imposed. A recent announcement, credited to the Government of the United States, seemed to indicate that president Wilson was not f avourable to any such discussion inadvance. However, the President might have no objection to an informal discussion, at least.The Prime Minister stated that President Wilson objected tosuch a discussion, and said at the same time that he was very sorrythat President Wilson was not coming to England on his way toFrance.League of Nations. 10. The Prime Minister pointed out that, while the BritishGovernment was committed to the principle of a League ofNations, neither this Government nor that of the United states had agreed to any particular plan.Sir Robert Borden was of opinion that we should be preparedto state our views as to a League of Nations. It was doubtfulwhether any scheme yet formulated was practicable in the sense ofassuring permanent results of distinct advantage. No one couldwithhold his sympathy and support from any proposals giving thefaintest promise of success. The report of Lord Phillimore&apos;sCommittee contained the only concrete proposals advanced up todate. The report of the French Committee embodied principlesrather than any practical scheme. At the request of PresidentWilson, the report of Lord Phillimore&apos;s Committee had not been published. President Wilson desired to put forward his observa-tions thereon, which he had not yet done. Sir Robert Bordensuggested the preparation of a Memorandum containing an analysis of the various proposals and of the considerations whichmight be urged for or against each proposal. This would assist in clarifying ideas and in enabling a conclusion to be reached whichmight be submitted to our Allies. There was, at least, possible a league of the two great English-speaking Commonwealths; and,with a view to arriving at such a league, Sir Robert Borden againurged that the United States should be invited to undertake world-preliminary discussion betweenthe Allied Powersbefore the PeaceConference.
5 IWC 38    M 9wide responsibilities in respect of undeveloped territories and back-ward races. ,General Smuts said that Lord Phillimore was at work on thissubject on behalf of the Foreign Office, and he himself, with SirErie Richards, was also engaged in the matter.Mr. Hughes said he objected to President Wilson&apos;s views,which he interpreted as meaning a world-State and the surrenderby the Great Powers of their self-governing rights. No country would allow its vital interests to be decided by anyone except itself.Mr. Hughes then gave various concrete cases to explain his mean-ing. One of these was that in Australia we had a continent whichwould hold 100,000,000 people, whereas the Australian populationonly amounted to 5,000,000. We were going to say to thousands of millions of people that no one else should come into Australia^ which we had no moral right to do. If the question went to a league of Nations the Australian view would not be supported.Mr. Hughes eventually suggested that the best solution would bean agreement between the United States and Great Britain, whichwould ensure the peace of the world.Clause 3 of 11. Mr. Hughes said that it appeared to him that Clause 3 of president Wilson&apos;s President Wilson&apos;s &quot; Fourteen Points,&quot; if he correctly interpreted&quot;Fourteen Points.&quot; tne Presidents meaning, would cause trouble. The only inter -pretation in this connection idiich Great Britain could agree to would be one which left each nation the same rights as it had before the war.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that HisMajesty&apos;s Government had definitely agreed to abolish its most-favoured-nation policy during the period of reconstruction.The Prime Minister said it was open to us at the Peace Con-ference to make any suggestions we liked.. 12. Mr. Hughes said that a lair reading of President Wilson&apos;sproposals wouid show tnat tney did not include any suggestion asto a war indemnity, if this was intended, an invidious distinctionwouid be raaae becween a country liise Belgium, or even Engian^,and Australia. Australia would get no reparation for damageincurred during the war,.The Prime Minister pointed out that the question of a warindemnity was a very difficult matter, owing to the fact that it wasnot clear as to how Germany could be made to pay such an indern-nity. Mr. Lloyd George then gave, as an example, the instance ofa possible claim by Australia for 300,000,000Z., and pointed outthat it was not an easy matter to say how such a claim would bepaid He asked if it was Mr. Hughes&apos; intention that Australiashould be paid in gold, or by Germany selling goods, and to thisquestion Mr. Hughes replied &quot; By credit.&quot; The Prime Ministerthen pointed out that, in order to pay the debt in this manner, it,would be necessary for Germany to sell goods, and asked who was going to buy them. The total debts of Germany would probablyamount to some 20,000,000,000Z., and it would be very easy for theAllied Powers to say to Germany that she had got to pay this amount, but he suggested that it would mean that for two genera-tions we would make German workmen our slaves. He further pointed out that someone must buy the goods manufactured inGermany, and,  or the moment, he did not see which nation wouldprovide the dumping-ground for such goods. Further, we wouldhave to allow Germany to import raw material for the manufactureof the goods. Mr. Lloyd George thought the only way in which germany could pay a large indemnity would be by manufacturingcheaper than other nations and by selling to them.The Chancellor of the Exchequer referred to a Treasury Corn-Reparation,Restoration, andIndemnity.
mittee which had considered this question, and arrived at theopinion that 2,000,000,0007. was the maximum amount which Ger-many could pay ; but Mr. Bonar Law did not agree with, this view.The debt of the British Government would be 8,000,000,000/:., ofwhich 1,000,000,000Z. was owed to the United States.Mr. Montagu drew attention to certain papers prepared at an earlier stage in the Treasury, with the collaboration, he thought,of Professor Zimmern., concerning the effect produced by an in-demnity on the country receiving it. He suggested that these documents should be placed at the disposal of the proposed Com-mittee.   This proposal was approved.Sir Robert Borden was of opinion that a carefully consideredMemorandum on the enforcement of an indemnity would be useful.The first question was as to Germany&apos;s ability to pay.The Prime Minister proposed the formation of a Committee ofthe Cabinet to consider the question of an indemnity. What he wanted to find out was whether we could get an indemnity out ofGermany without doing ourselves harm in the future.A discussion of some length then ensued as to how such aCommittee should be constituted, and it was finally decided that A Committee, composed as follows Mr. Hughes (Chairman), -Sir George Foster,Mr. Walter Long,Mr. Hewins, andTwo business men to be chosen by Mr. Hughes, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Ex-cbequer,should investigate the matter, on the assumption that theenenry ought to pay an indemnity : the following ques-tions to be specially considered the amount of indemnitywhich it would be possible to exact; the means by whichpayment could be made; and the subsequent effect on theAllied countries of Germany having to pay such an indemnity. . &apos;2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,November 26, 1918.o
