2The Western Front. 1. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported  that  a telephone message had been received from General Du Cane, whosaid that the Germans appeared to be falling back along the whole line between the Ailette and the Meuse.   Our troops were following.steamshipJ&quot; Leinster.&quot;2. The First Sea Lord reported that the Irish mail boat&quot; Leinster,&quot; outward bound from Kingstown, had been torpedoed and sunk on the previous morning. Two torpedoes had been fired,the first at 9&apos;28, and the second at 9&apos;47, and the vessel had sunkthree minutes later. A very, heavy sea was running at the time,which had increased the difficulty of rescue work. It was feared that 50 officers and 300 other ranks had been lost.Allied Oonfrencesin Paris.Prime ministers statement.German Proposalfor Armistice.3. The Prime Minister, dealing with the Conferences which hadbeen held in Paris between the 5th October and 9th October, 1918,said that he went over to confer with the French and italian governments, after the discussions which had taken place in theWar Cabinet, mainly with regard to the situation in Turkey and bulgaria; but, after arrival in France, the news was published of theGerman proposal of an armistice in  order   to   negotiate peace,on the basis of President Wilsons &quot;Fourteen Points.&quot;   For1 somedays  no  official intimation   was  received by any of the PrimeMinisters, either from fhe United States of America or from anyneutral country, as to this proposed armistice, and, although itappeared in the newspapers that Prince Max of Baden had readput to the Reichstag the message which he had despatched to president Wilson, it was not possible for some days, owing to lack of official information, for the Prime Ministers in Paris to deal with thequestion.   The representatives of the three Governments, however,met every day and discussed the situation.   They also conferred with Marshal Foch and his Chief of Staff, and with the military representatives at Versailles, and, as a preliminary step, directedtheir attention to the terms of an armistice.   All the militaryauthorities demanded very drastic terms if an armistice were to begranted, and the Military Representatives at Versailles differed fromMarshal Foch to the extent that they were in favour of the german army being disarmed before the evacuation of the occupied territories.All, however, were agreed that the Germany army must retire tothe Rhine, and Marshal Foch, moreover, urged the setting up oftwo or three bridgeheads on the right bank.   The Italian government not only demanded the evacuation of the Trentino but also askedfor the evacuation of Istiia.   I he principal point made by the militaryauthorities was that, if an armistice were once granted, there wouldprobably never be any resumption of hostdities, particularly if theenemy evacuated all occupied territories, and it was therefore essentialthat the terms of the armistice should approximate as closely aspossible to the conditions of peace which could be accepted.   Themilitary authorities laid stress on the point that merely to allow thearmy to retire from conquered territories would enable the germans to do what they were most anxious to do, namely, to shorten their line, re-constitute their airnies, and place themselves, from a military point of view, in a better position to resume battle at a later date.On the receipt of President Wilson&apos;s telegram in answer to the message of Prince Max of Baden, the French Government were, onthe whole, pleased, but Marshal Foch thought that the part dealingwith the conditions of an armistice was insufficient.   Mr. Lloyd Georgesaid that he, personally, was alarmed at the telegram, and thatundoubtedly a very difficult situation would be  created if theGerman Government was wise enough to accept President Wilson&apos;terms.   Accordingly a telegram was sent, approved by the Conference3for transmission to President Wilson, dwelling on the desirability ofdemanding greater guarantees with regard to the military position(Appendix, Annex IV).   Mr. Lloyd George expressed the opinion
that the statements made by President Wilson to the effect that unless his terms were accepted he could not recommend an armistice,implied that if they were accepted he would recommend such acourse; and then for an armistice to be refused would have a bad effect not only on the Allied troops engaged, but also a most serious effect on public opinion in the Allied countries. It was undoubtedly a fact that many interpretations could be put on the meaning ofsome of the &quot;Fourteen Points&quot; which were to be the basis of theacceptance of the Germans&apos; request for an armistice, more particularly those passages which related to the freedom of the seas, to Austria,and to Alsace-Lorraine.The Prime Minister of Australia, in supporting the contentionof the military authorities that an armistice must approximate tothe basis,of the conditions of peace, urged that, as Germany had,since the outbreak of hostilities, made commercial treaties withRussia which would undoubtedly be greatly to her advantage froman economic point of view on the cessation of hostilities, it should bea condition of any armistice that such treaties should be null andvoid. It would be impossible, once hostilities had ceased, to startthem again to prevent Germany gaining these or any other economic advantages. Mr. Hughes suggested that steps should beefcake^ * *rprevent Germany being given a position of economic advantage atthe expense of Britain, France, or any of the Allies, and that adragnet clause should be inserted in the conditions of armisticewhich would generally give power to the Allied Governments totake any action necessary to safeguard Allied interests in this or anypther direction.Mr. Lloyd George pointed out that Clause 17 of the JointResolution, regarding the conditions&apos; of an armistice with Germanyand Austria-Hungary, provided for the present blockade conditionsremaining unchanged, and this&apos;power would, provide a lever for the enforcement of conditions such as Mr. Hughes spoke of without the renewal of hostilities. Moreover, as no final decisions were taken,and as the actual conditions of an armistice must vary, as the conferences had agreed with Marshal Foch, according to the militarysituation existing at the moment at which it was arranged, theconditions proposed would undoubtedly have to be reconsidered.The First Sea Lord urged that, while one of the conditions ofthe armistice was that at least sixty German submarines should beretained in Allied ports (Clause 10), no mention was made of theGerman fleet, and, if the conditions of an armistice were m any wayto have an effect on the conditions of peace terms, this point should,in his opinion, have most careful consideration.Attention was called to a telegram from Mr. Barclay, dated the9th October, saying that President Wilson was astounded at thereceipt of two telegrams from General Bliss enumerating the termsupon which the Prime Miuisters had agreed as a basis for an armistice with Germany and Austria, and it was explained that an error, dueprobably to the illness of General Bliss, who had not been able toattend the meeting of the Military Representatives in person, hadbeen made, and the misunderstanding on this question had nowbeen cleared up, a telegram having been sent to Washington by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs on the 10th October.Representation pf With reference to the suggestion which had been made tothe United States President Wilson in telegram No. 7230 of 9th October, that hein Europe. should send to Europe an American representative, possessing thefull confidence of the United States Government, to confer, whenoccasion arose, with the other Associated Governments so as to keep them accurately and fully informed of the point of view of theUnited States Government; Mr. Lloyd George pointed out thatthe Conference met with many difficulties through having noauthoritative representative of the United States present. As a consequence, President Wilson might have assumed that theconditions of an armistice with Germany, which were discussed at
the Conference, but on which no decision was taken, had beenagreed to. As a matter of fact, they were only prepared in order tobe ready.Lord Reading, questioned as to whether he considered it wasnot advisable that Colonel House should be at Versailles, urged thatthe difficulty about Colonel House leaving America was that he wasthe only means by which the representatives of the Allied Govern-ments could reach President Wilson informally, which was veryessential. At the same time, Lord Reading expressed an opinion in favour of Colonel House going to Versailles, if President Wilsonapproved.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in consultationwith Lord Robert Cecil, who had attended the ParisConferences, should prepaid a telegram to send to thePresident of the United States, giving a full account ofthe discussions which took place at the Conferences heldin Paris with regard to the conditions of an armistice with Germany.(b.) A corresponding telegram should also be sent to all theDominion Prime Ministers, by the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies, and to the Viceroy of India, by theSecretary of State for India.Mr. Lloyd George said that, with regard to Bulgaria, the onlytrouble which arose was that the French Government was anxiousto have full control of an attack on Constantinople. The british army in Salonica had for three years occupied a position on the right flank, in a most unhealthy situation, where it had suffered severely,and the moment when the right flank came to be the post of honourGeneral Franchet d&apos;Esperey issued instructions for the British army to be broken up and for another army, organised under a french general, to take its place in that position. General franchet d&apos;Esperey had also issued orders for French contingents to be sentto Albania, and for another French army to proceed to Belgrade, allunder the command of French Generals. Mr. Lloyd George saidthat he instantly protested, pointing out that General franchet d&apos;Esperey had made his dispositions without consulting general milne, which Marshal Foch never did with regard to Field-marshal sir Douglas Haig, and also that, if a similar situation occurred during an advance on Berlin, Marshal Foch, he was convinced,would never displace Field-Marshal Haig. The result of thenegotiations on this subject, however, was that General Milne wasto be left in command of the section of the Allied Army of the Eastmarching on Constantinople, on condition that contingents of allthe Allies were incorporated in his army, which, however, should consist mainly of British troops.With regard to Turkey, it appeared at one time as if proposalsfor peace would be put forward by the Turkish Government. Theconditions of an armistice with Turkey, which had been agreed upon by the British Admiralty and the British War Office, were submittedto the conference, and, in the main, accepted, a few conditions beingadded which made the terms of the armistice more drastic. Theseconditions had now been sent to General Allenby.It was suggested that it was desirable, now that the conditionsof an armistice with Turkey had been approved at the Conferencesheld in Paris, that President Wilson should be informed of these terms.The War Cabinet decided that The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, after informing theFrench and Italian Governments that it was proposed todo so, should telegraph the conditions of armistice, as.
9rj6 8Naval allied command in theMediterraneanMilitary -Representatives, at10 th  October, were unablequestion of the command of4. The Prime Minister stated that it had been agreed that ameeting should be held at Versailles between the Military Repre-sentatives and Representatives of the American, British, French,and Italian Navies to consider the liaison between the Allied navaland military forces operating against Constantinople, together withthe question of the command of the Allied naval forces.The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that the Naval andtheir meeting at Versailles on theto arrive at an agreement on thethe Allied naval forces engaged inoperation against Turkey. A proposal, he said, was put to themeeting that, as the command of the Eastern section of the AlliedArmy marching on Constantinople had been placed by the AlliedPowers under the direct command of a British General who wouldbe under the orders of the French Commander-in-Chief, the allied naval command should likewise be entrusted, as far as the opera-tions in the iEgean were concerned, to a British Admiral under theorders of the Allied Naval Commander-in-Chief, in order thatintimate co-operation between the two services might be ensured.The French Representatives argued that, since control of all major operations in the Mediterranean was already vested in the hands ofa French Commander-in-Chief, it was only logical that he should determine the forces which were required, and should also nominatethe officer in command, and they would not agree to the definiteproposal that a British Admiral should be placed in command. as no agreement could be reached, the question was referred back tothe Prime Ministers.The First Sea Lord pointed out that the British force in theMediterranean, although numerically inferior, was superior to theFrench force. The British naval force in the iEgean had done allthe spade-work with regard to any possible attack on the Straits,and he had already issued instructions to concentrate mine-sweepers, &amp;&apos;c, in that area, of which the French had none. Inorder to take the command from the British Admiral, it would benecessary to send a French Admiral to the iEgean, and AdmiralWemyss expressed the opinion that this would not be done, at anyrate, until the moment arrived for the big ships to move up theStraits, because the French Admiral bad taken up a strong line in refusing to withdraw battleships from the entrance of the Adriaticto the North iEgean.The opinion was strongly expressed that, as all the operations against the Turks, with the exception of French contingents sent toGallipoli during the operations in that peninsula, had been conducted by British naval and military forces, the command both on land and sea in any attack on Constantinople should be British.The War Cabinet decided that The First Sea Lord should prepare a memorandum, setting forth fully the arguments in favour of British command for the Allied naval forces operating against Constanti-nople, and that the Prime Minister, in consultation withthe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, should have authority to approve it on behalf of the War Cabinet, andto despatch it to the French President of the Council.[1865-484]Capproved at meetings of the Conference of British, Frenchand Italian Prime Ministers held in Paris, to the Presidentof the United States of America.
5. The War Cabinet took note of the conclusions reached atthe series of Conferences held between British, French, and italian governments in Paris between 5th and 9th October, 1918. (Appendix.)6. With reference to War Cahinet 482, Minute 7, the WarCabinet had before them a memorandum by the Inter-DepartmentalPrisoners of War Committee (Paper G.T.-5928) with regard to the ratification of the Anglo-German Agreement for the exchange ofprisoners of war, and the question of reprisals for the ill-treatment ofBritish prisoners of war in German hands.Sir George Cave said that the question was very urgent, andone on which there was very strong feeling in the country. he urged that it should be a term of any armistice that might be concluded with the Germans that our prisoners of war should be senthome immediately. This had already been done as regards Bulgaria,and he understood that General Allenby had also receivedinstructions that, in case of Turkey proposing an armistice, he should include in its terms the return of all British prisoners of war in turkish hands.Mr. Bonar Law said that this provision had been included in thedraft conditions for armistices with Turkey and the Central Powersrespectively, prepared by the naval and military advisers of theGovernments concerned, for the consideration of the recent ParisConferences.Sir George Cave, continuing, said that, with regard to theclause in the Agreement relating to the exchange of submarineprisoners, the Germans had declined to give way on this point.They bad also refused to ratify the Agreement unless their proposals relating to the Germans interned in China were agreed to. On this latter point Sir George Cave thought that the only way to keep thematter open was to agree that the Germans in China, though theymust now be interned, should be entitled to be repatriated, in thesame way as Germans in other parts of the world. Sir George Cavesaw no way of getting over the difficulty of the submarine crews. Ifwe ratified the Agreement as it now stood it would mean that twenty-five German submarine officers in Holland and Switzerland would beallowed to return home, on the terms that they were not again to goto sea or be used at the front. If we held out on this question, he saw no hope of the Agreement being ratified.The First Sea Lord stated that the Admiralty had estimatedthat the return of these twenty-five German submarine officers wouldbe in effect giving the Germans fifty additional submarines. At theend of this year the Germans would have a greater number of sub-marines than ever before, about 183, and the value of these returnedofficers for training submarine crews would be very great, especially as the Germans were at the moment finding great difficulty inobtaining and training crews.Mr. Bonar Law said that the House of Commons felt very strongly on this matter, and, should the Agreement not be ratified,the Government might find itself in a difficult Parliamentary situa-tion. He understood that there were some 60,000 prisoners involvedin the exchange on each side, and, if the Agreement was not signed,every relation of every prisoner in England would say that theGovernment had stopped 60,000 men coming home for the sake of twenty-five men.A question was asked as to whether the crews of the submarineswould be involved in the exchange, as well as the officers, and sir george Cave said that the wording of this clause was not very clear,and it was arguable whether the crews should be repatriated as welas the officers.Sir George Cave then raised the question of reprisals. He saidthat, whether or not we went on with the negotiations in regard to
the Agreement, it was essential to deal with the very urgent matterof the treatment of our prisoners in Germany. The Germans werebreaking their agreement, inasmuch as they were making prisonerswork within 30 kilom. of the firing line ; they were using prisoners forwar work of various descriptions, they were grossly overworking themin the salt mines, and were altogether treating them in an abominableway. At The Hague protests had been lodged and the germans had promised to make reforms, but nothing had been done.He suggested that the British Government should say plainly thatthe Germans would be held accountable for these breaches of inter-national law, and that the authors and those responsible for carryingout these breaches would be punished. He also suggested that weshould threaten reprisals immediately. He agreed that we could never compete with the Germans in cruelty, but the Germans were very sensitive to the treatment of their officers; and if we told themthat they must carry out certain reforms in regard to the treatmentof our prisoners in Germany and that, if they did not do so, reprisalswould be carried out after a certain time, he thought this would have some effect.Mr. Long said that, while the Germans were committing theseatrocious acts, we were treating Germans in this country with thehighest honour. He thought that something should be done withregard to the smart German officers&apos; internment camps in thiscountry.It was suggested that we might make it a condition of the peacethat those individuals who had been responsible for the ill-treatmentof our prisoners should be tried by a court of law. It was pointedout, however, that it would be very difficult to fix responsibility. Inaddition, no nation, unless it was beaten to the dust, would accept such terms. If England had been badly beaten in this war, we should never agree to our officers being tried by German tribunals. As amatter of principle, threats should not be made which, in practice,could not be enforced.Lord Milner said that the main object was to improve thecondition of our prisoners, and he thought improvement could beobtained immediately by making the treatment of the German officersin this country more severe. He suggested that this should be done without giving any notice to the German Government, and that weshould say that the treatment would be continued until the lot ofour prisoners was improved. It was pointed out, however, that underThe Hague Agreement of 1917 we were bound to give 28 days&apos;notice before taking measures of reprisal.Lord Robert Cecil said that he could not recall a single instancewhen the carrying out of reprisals had obtained good results. Thethreatening of reprisals had, however, in certain instances, been very effective. The Germans were very sensitive to outside opinion, andhe thought if we threatened to publish such instances of ill-treat-ment as were attached to Sir George Cave&apos;s memorandum it wouldhave a great effect on the German attitude to this question. Inaddition, there had been a change of Government in Germany, at thehead of which was now a man who was always reported to havelooked at the prisoners of war question from a humane point ofview.Sir George Cave, in support of the statement about the Germansusceptibility to public opinion, said that the German negotiators atthe recent Hague Conference had pressed that the hostile articles in the British press should cease.The War Cabinet decided To adopt Sir George Cave&apos;s suggestion with regard to reprisals,with the exception of making it a condition of the peace tohold individual Germans responsible for the ill-treatment ofprisoners of war.   On this latter point we should inform
american relations:Purchase of Wool.the German Government that we would take all steps inour power to insist that the persons responsible for theseoutrages should be punished for their misdeeds.With regard to the question of submarine prisoners, the WarCabinet deecided that- -We should not insist on an alteration of this clause in the Agree-ment. but should offer to ratify the Agreement as it stands.7. With reference to War Cabinet 483, Minute 13, the WarCabinet had before them a memorandum by Mr. Chamberlain (paper g.T.-5935) in which Mr. Chamberlain pointed out that he had been commisioned by the Cabinet to discuss with Mr. Summers, of theUnited States of America, any questions arising out of the ProgrammeCommittees, and stated that he had already had repeated interviewson the subject with Mr. Summers and representatives of the ForeignOffice, Colonial Office, War Office, and the Board of Trade. Mr.Chamberlain suggested that, in the circumstances, and subject toLord Beading&apos;s concurrence, the decision of the Cabinet recorded inthe aforesaid Minute might be amended so as to leave the settlementof the. wool question to him.Lord Beading having signified his concurrence, the War cabinet approved Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s proposal and directed-The Secretary to take the necessary action to alter the wording of Minute 13 of the 483rd Meeting.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,October 12, 1918.
APPENDIX.(I.C.-82.) -Summary of Conclusions reached at the series of Conferences held betweenthe British, French, and Italian Governments in Paris, between thb.5th October and 9th October, 1918.Five Conferences were held in all, in addition to a Conference on Man-Powerbetween the British representatives and Marshal Foch. The principal subjects discussed and the conclusions reached at this series of Conferences were as follows :&apos;- Military Operations in the Balkans.1. The French President of the Council should send two telegrams to GeneralFranchet d&apos;Esperey in the following sense : No. I.While you will continue the movement for the occupation of Serbian and Bulgarianterritories, I give you orders to re-group the British armies, which you should not havedivided without consulting General Milne and referring to me. You should place themin i,the eastern region of your position to carry out dispositions we have agreed on with our Allies, and which will be communicated to you in due course. On theother side, the French divisions marching, the one on El Bassan and Durazzo andthe other on Alessio and Scutari, should be taken away without being replaced, to dispose of as you wish, Italian troops continuing their advance in these directions. Inthe execution of your new plan, which you will submit, do your best not to separate thenational armies placed under your command.No. 2.The British, French, and Italian Governments agree that the immediate action ofthe Allies for exploiting the situation in the Balkans  shall be  developed oh the^following bases: (1.) The section of the Allied army of the east marching on Constantinople shallbe under the immediate command of a British General, who shall himself be under the orders of the Allied Commander-in-Chief;(2.) The section of the army of the east marching on Constantinople shall consist mainly of British troops, but shall also include French, Italian, Greek, andSerbian troops ;(3.) Reciprocally, some British troops shall take part in the operation in the-north. (I.C.-79, pp. 4 and 5.)2. At the end of the last meeting of the Conference, it was agreed, on the motion of Mr. Lloyd George To refer to the military representatives at Versailles, with whom should be associated representatives of the American, British, French, and Italian navies,the question of the liaison between the naval and military forces of the allies in the forthcoming operations against Constantinople, together with thequestion of the command of the Allied naval forces engaged in these operations^(I.C.-81, p. 11.) -Conditions of an Armistice with Turkey.3. Information having been received by the British Prime Minister during the conferences as to a possible imminent approach by Turkey for a separate peace, theConference considered the question of the conditions of an armistice with Turkey onthe basis of proposals drawn up by a conference of Admiralty and War office representatives in London. After several discussions on the subject, and reference tothe naval and military representatives of Great Britain, France, and Italy, the conditions set forth in Annex I were.approved. (I.C.-77, p. 6 ; I.C.-79, p. 10&quot;; I.C.-80, p. 1.)[1365-484] &apos; D
4. Note was taken of a request made to the French Government by the GreekGovernment, asking that, in view of the vital interests of Hellenism in great parts ofthe Ottoman Empire, negotiations for an armistice or peace with Turkey should not take place without a preliminary understanding with the Cabinet at Athens.The Austro-German Request for an Armistice.5. After the receipt of information that the Central Powers had applied to president Wilson for an armistice with a view to peace negotiations, the Conferenceinvited the military representatives at Versailles, with whom were associatedrepresentatives of the American, British, French, and Italian navies, to consider thequestion of the conditions of an armistice with Germany and Austria on the basisof the following principles : (1.) Total evacuation by the enemy of France, Belgium, Luxemburg, and Italy.(2.) The Germans to retire behind the Rhine into Germany.(3.) Alsace-Lorraine to be evacuated by German troops without occupation by theAllies.(4.) The same conditions to apply to the Trentino and Istria.(5.) Serbia and Montenegro to be evacuated by the enemy.(6.) Evacuation of the Caucasus.(7.) Immediate steps to be taken (&quot; mise en train&quot;) for the evacuation of allterritory belonging to Russia and Roumania before the war.(8.) Immediate cessation of submarine warfare.(It was also agreed that the Allied blockade should not be raised.) (I.C.-79, p. 9.)At a subsequent meeting the Conference had before them Marshal Foch&apos;s view(Annex II) and a Joint Naval and Military Report from Versailles (Annex III). no final decisions were taken on this subject, as Marshal Foch, at a later meeting, insisted that the actual conditions of an armistice would vary according to the militarysituation existing at the moment at which it was arranged.   (I.C.-81, p. 10.)6. After a prolonged discussion at one meeting, and an adjournment to enable adraft to be prepared by Lord Robert Cecil, M. Pichon, and Barron Sonnino, the secret and confidential telegrams in Annex IV were approved for presentation jointly by the ambassadors of Great Britain, France, and Italy to President Wilson. (I.C.-81, p. 10.)Among minor decisions taken by the Conference, the following are worthy ofmention : Postponement of a Conference of Oppressed Nationalities.7. It was agreed To postpone for a month the congress of oppressed nationalities which had been fixed for the 15th October, 1918, in Paris (XC.-80, p. 1.)Transmission to America of a Message from the Socialist Congress at Paris.8. It was agreed that It was undesirable that the French Government should officially transmit to washington a resolution from the Socialist Congress in session at Paris to president Wilson on the subject of the Austro-German request for an armistice. It was agreed, however, that the French Government should useits discretion to allow the resolution to be despatched as a private message,with or without delay as they might think fit.   (I.C.-80, p. 2.)Belgium and the Supreme War Council.9. The Conference decided that The request of the Belgian Government for a permanent military representative at versailles could not be agreed to, but that when questions affecting Belgium,such as conditions of an armiscice on the Western front, were underconsideration by the military representatives at Versailles, a Belgian military representative might be invited to attend.
Man-Power.10. In addition to the Conference of the three Powers, a useful conversation tookplace between the Prime Minister, Mr. Bonar Law, and the Chief of theImperial General Staff, with Marshal Foch and General Weygand, on thequestion of man-power. No actual decisions are recorded, but the PrimeMinister undertook that Marshal Foch&apos;s views should be put before the WarCabinet when the question of man-power came up. A full note of this conference is, therefore, being circulated separately.   (I.G-78.)2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,October 11, 1918.Annex I.Conditions of an Armistice with Turkey.

18. In stating their terms as above, the Allied Governments cannot lose sight ofthe fact that the Government of Germany is in a position peculiar among the nations of Europe in that its word canuot be believed, and that it denies any obligation of honour. It is necessary, therefore, to demand from Germany material guarantees ona scale which will serve the purpose aimed at by a signed agreement in cases amongstordinary civilised nations. In those circumstances, the Allied Governments demand that Within 48 hours : (1.) The fortresses of Metz, Thionville, Strassburg, Neu Breisach, and the townand fortifications of Lille be surrendered to the Allied Commanders-in-Chief.(2.) Heligoland be surrendered to the Allied Naval Commander-in-Ohief in theNorth Sea.&apos;19.

They therefore think it would be of verj great assistance if an american representative possessing the full confidence of the United States Governmentcould be sent to Europe to confer, when occasion arose, with the other associated governments so as to keep them accurately and fully informed of the point of view ofUnited States Government.(Repeated to Foreign Office, No. 1230.)
