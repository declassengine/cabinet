The western front:Reorganisation ofthe German ,Armies.Austrian troops on the western front.1. The Director of Military Operations reported that the GermanCommand had been reorganised. A group of armies had been inter-polated between those of the Crown Prince and Prince Rupprecht,and placed under General von Boehm. General von Boehm Wasreputed to be a good fighting soldier. The change was analogous to one we had adopted during the first battle of the Somme,when we interpolated the Vth Army between the IHrd and TVthArmies.2. With reference to War Cabinet 455, Minute 1, the Directorof Military Operations stated that there were no further indications of Austrian troops arriving on the Western front.The Italian Front.3, The Director of Military Operations reported that no furtherdefinite news had been received with regard to the operations on theItalian front. &quot; The Italians were pursuing a limited objective for the possession of certain peaks which would improve their facilities forobservation.Italian Cruiserwrecked.4. With reference to War Cabinet 458 and Imperial WarCabinet 31, Minute 3, the Deputy First Sea Lord stated that an italian mine-sweeper, the &quot; Gaeta&quot; was also reported sunk, and thatthere had been 1 killed and 6-injured on board theFrench destroyer&quot; Mangini.&quot; The total casualties so far as: could be ascertained,were 4&quot;. killed, 7 missing, and 140 injured. There were no civilian casualties, and there had been no damage to H.M.S. &quot; Archer.&quot;Submarines.5. :The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that an unidentifiedenemy sunken submarine had been discovered by divers in the; Dover-Straits. The evidence showed that it had probably been sunk by a mine about two or three months ago.With reference, to&apos;War1 Cabinet 458 and Imperial-War Cabinet31,&apos; Minute 2, Admiral Hope reported that there seemed no doubtthat the submarine had been sunk, as sweepers had now located it,and air and oil bubbles had risen in large quantities.Submarines off theAmerican Coast.6. The Deputy First Sea&quot; Lord reported that there appeared tobe three enemy-submarines, operating off the. American coast: betweenHalifax and.Cape Hatteras. iThe submarines seemed tobe working at a distance of between 100 and 150 miles from the coast.norwegian territorial&apos; Waters.7. With reference to Imperial War Cabinet 29,. Minute 11,. theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs stated that the Foreign Officeand the Admiralty were engaged in a very anxious controversy with Norway, which it might be desirable that the War Cabinet should consider.It was decided that The Secretary should - place the subject on. the agenda for thefollowing &quot;day,1 Friday, the 16th August.Transport of american Troops.8. With reference to Imperial War Cabinet 29, Minute 1, thePrime Minister called attention to the question of providing adequatetransport &apos; for the conveyance 6&apos;f American troops. The originalundertaking to send 100 divisions by July 1919 had been cut downto 80, and the American Government did not undertake to send the
reduced number unless the British Government assisted with cargosteamers. He had discussed the matter with Lord Beading, and hethought it desirable that Lord Beading should examine the situation from all standpoints, and that he should see General Bliss andGeneral Pershing in France on the subject. From information whichhad reached him (the Prime Minister) *it would appear that theAmerican Government were putting forward demands for stores,timber, &amp;c, on a very extravagant scale, which would place a very heavy strain on our man-power at home and on our shipping. If the americans could not maintain the eighty divisions, it would be better to -fit them into our organisation, and Lord Beading might discussthat point in France.Mr. Chamberlain confirmed the view that the orders issued bythe Americans for clothing, rifles, ammunition, &amp;c, related toquantities largely in excess of anything that the British or french had ever been able to use. He thought Lord Reading shouldslookinto the dispute which had arisen in the wool trade, and the agree-ment concluded, according to which no more men were to be taken from the wool trade because they were required to provide supplies for fhe American Army.It was decided that On behalf of the Imperial War Cabinet, Lord Reading should examine the problem of providing transport for the con-veyance of American divisions and their equipment, andthat the Prime Minister of New Zealand should com-municate to Lord Reading the views of the Dominions onthe shipping situation.as- 9. Lord  Curzon,  continuing the  discussion  on War Aims,,expressed his dissent from the pessimistic view taken by general smuts with regard to the military situation. That situation had greatly improved in the West, and, generally speaking, the moral of the Allied nations stood as high as ever, while that of the germans and their Allies had been dashed by the failure of their expectations.In the East, too, he considered the danger of the position hadbeen exaggerated by General Smuts. In Russia itself there were signs of reviving effort, while in the Middle East the position,though serious, was not as yet menacing. He did not himself con-template a great tide of invasion rolling against our EasternEmpire while our efforts were being sterilized in the West. nor did he agree with General Smuts that we should consider the next , i &quot; ?/ioffers of peace made by Germany, even if superficially -possible, A,y\.until further military results had been obtained. Even more/serious, to his mind, than the prospect of the War ending withthe United States&apos; and Japan relatively unexhausted and pre-dominant, was that of its ending with a predominant and unexhaustedGermany. He was convinced that it was essential to go on hammeringtill Germany was definitely beaten and brought to a different frame of mind, so that we could 6ecure a peace which Germany would keep and not have the strength to break. He thought general smuts had hardly been quite fair to Mr. Balfour&apos;s statement asregards the European situation. That statement appeared to himnot so much to lay down war aims, *as to outline war aspirationswhich it did not rest with us to settle, though they might besettled, in so far as they were attainable, by a Conference with our allies before we entered into any Peace Conference with the enemy.- As regards war aims outside of Europe, these ranged from a smallarea of definite certainty to a wide region as to which there werediffering degrees of doubt. The. area of certainty comprised suchmatters as the Islands of the South Pacific and German South-West - Africa, which could not iri anv circumstances be 2,&apos;ivenback.   In the middle sphere there was such a question as that of&quot;[706-3] 2 B
Mesopotamia. Mesopotamia obviously could not be handed back to turkey except in the case of a complete German victory, and its development as part of the future Arab State could only take place under the guidance of ourselves, who were the initiators of the Arabidea, and had already taken the work in hand. As regards Palestine,he was prepared to accept the suggestion of the trusteeship being offered to America, though his own information led him to doubt whether America would be as willing to undertake it as LordPleading had suggested, President Wilson&apos;s mind running . in thedirection rather of an international police jjaiker.. than of american administration. At the other end of the scale came such acrucial and difficult case as that of German East Africa. Thepossibility of that territory ever going back to Germany ought to be resisted to the very last, in view of the dangers, arising notmerely from black armies, but from enemy harbours, docks, sub-marine stations, wireless stations, and aerodromes, which it wouldinvolve to our whole position, and more particularly to our navalposition in that part of the world. Speaking for himself, with alife&apos;s experience of seeing the work done by England in the develop-ment of backward countries, he saw no reason why we should be sourgent in handing over such a region to anybody else. Whileentirely in favour of the idea of the United States extending its responsibilities where it could properly do so, he was not other-wise anxious to set up a series of American colonies everywhere inproximity to ours, and he deprecated the idea of our going to thePeace Conference with the notion of only receiving as much as president Wilson chose to offer us.Mr. Barnes expressed surprise at General Smuts&apos; pessimisticforecast of the military situation, and pointed out that it disagreedwith the forecast given by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff in&apos;his Memorandum. He agreed, however, that our statement of war aims had been too ambitious in the past. Our people would notfight indefinitely for all these aims, and both in this country and inFrance there was a growing movement in a pacifist direction. Themost effective way, in his opinion, of torpedoing that movement wasto summon an Inter-Ailed Conference for the revision of our war aims, so as to bring them more into line with the views of therespective peoples. As regards the German colonies, he agreed withGeneral Smuts&apos; conception that the Tropical African colonies shouldbe retained by the Powers now in possession, but subject to theoversight of an International Board, or of the League of Nationsitself. With regard to the islands in the South Pacific, he heartilysupported the view expressed by Mr. Hughes and Mr. Massey. if those islands were handed back to the Germans the South Pacificwould no longer be safe to live in. As regards Mesopotamia, he considered it should be an Arab State under British guardianship,and believed the same also to be the destiny of Palestine. He didnot consider that the British people, after all the efforts and sacrificesthey had made, would be at all in favour of handing over palestine to any other guardianship, even that of America.Mr. Chamberlain thought that the pessimistic tone of general smuts&apos; survey was due to the fact that he had purposely confined hisreview to the purely military situation, and had not taken account ofthe increasing effect upon the enemy of internal exhaustion. The extentof that exhaustion would depend, above all things, on our success indenying Russia to Germany. As regards Europe, he agreed with lord Curzon that all we could do was to indicate ideal solutions, andhe agreed that it might be necessaryto revise some of the provisionalundertakings given, which were contingent on the assumption of complete victory. But he was quite clear that the demand for revision should come from our Allies and not from us. After all,they would recognise sooner than anyone else whether the situation would allow of the fulfilment of their full war aims. It would be fatal for our future in Europe if we created the impression that we
were trying to back out of our agreements. at the expense of our allies. As regards the British Empire, he was by no means anxious that we should extend our responsibilities, or invite the jealousyinvolved in great extensions of British territory. But he was clearthat, whatever happened, we could not surrender to anyone either the South*Pacific Islands or German South-West Africa. With regardto Mesopotamia, Palestine, and East Africa, the question resolveditself into one of the security of the British Empire and of its Allies.No one conversant with the position of the Indian Empire could contemplate the possibility of allowing a revival of the threatimplied in the old Baghdad Railway scheme. It was equallyessential that German East Africa should not revert to the Germans,and he suggested it might be desirable that a reasoned statement ofthe case with regard to German East Africa, from the point of viewof our security, should be informally communicated to our Allies, andmore particularly to President Wilson. As regards Tropical Africagenerally, he was willing, in the last resort, to contemplate some such solution as General Smuts had advocated, though he did notconsider it desirable in itself, in view of the difficulty of clearlydefining the functions of the International Board. In any case hewas absolutely opposed to any form of condominium. He was entirely in favour of the United States taking an increased respon-sibility in oversea affairs, and thought the idea of an Americanprotectorate of Palestine probably the only one which would bewell viewed by any of our Allies. It was interesting, however, tofind in that connection how strongly Mr. Barnes had expressed himself against our abandoning it.Mr. Plughes hoped that the British Government would not commit itself to what General Smuts had said with regard to theacceptance of German offers of peace. He agreed with Lord Curzonthat it was essential to bring Germany to a right frame of mind.He was also opposed to the suggested Allied Conference on war aims. To discuss these matters with President Wilson at this stage would only create serious embarrassment.The Prime Minister expressed the conviction that an Inter-Allied Conference on War Aims, so far from leading to a generalmoderating of claims, would lead to each Ally accentuating its claimswith a view to subsequent bargaining. His experience of past Con-ferences convinced him that such moderate statements of War Aimsas those which he and President Wilson had put forward at thebeginning of the year would never have been accepted at a Conference.On the question of Peace Terms he considered it essential thatGermany should first be beaten. That was more important than theactual terms themselves. Germany had committed a great crime, andit was necessary to make it impossible that anyone should be tempted to. repeat that ,oJfenc.e. The -Terms of Peace must be tantamount tosome penalty for.the offence. It was from this point of view, as wellas for other reasons, that he thought it essential that Germanyshovdd be deprived of her colonies. When it came to the questionof what was to be done with those colonies, the thing that reallymattered was that they should be properly developed in the interestsof their inhabitants. It did not seem to him, in view of the immenseterritories already in our possession which called for development,that the fullest development would be secured if we took them over.But he considered that America, with her immense wealth and enter-prise, would do far more for the development of such a region as EastAfrica than we could, and therefore, from the point of view of develop-ment, in the interests both of the inhabitants and of the civilised worldgenerally, as well as to commit hereto oversea responsibilities, he was allin favour of inviting America to take in hand the trusteeship ofthat colony. He agreed, however, in answer to an interjection fromMr. Hughes, that, if America declined, the responsibility wouldhave to fall back on ourselves. As regards the military situation, hequite admitted the possibility of our not breaking through and
definitely beating the Germans in 1919. . But he was confident thatwe should achieve such progress, both actually and from the pointof view of the progressive deterioration of internal conditions amongthe enemy, that we could hope in 1920 to inflict upon Germany adefeat which she herself would recognise to be a defeat. He wasnot alarmed by the evidences of pacifism to which Mr. Barnes had referred. The temper of the French public was better than it hadbeen at any period during the war, and our own workmen were not going to give in until we had beaten the Germans. He was con-vinced that we ought to go on until we could dictate terms whichwould definitely mark the view taken by humanity of the heinous-ness of Germany&apos;s offence, and which would be the effective starting-point of a League of Nations.In a brief discussion which followed, Mr. Massey and Mr.Montagu both drew attention to the effect upon the Moslem popu-lation of the British Empire of handing over Palestine, which was mainly a Moslem country, to the United States, which had no experience of administering the Moslems, and whose ideas as to thefuture of Palestine might be thoroughly unsympathetic to them.Lord Beading expressed the view that America would not accept any proposal to make herself responsible for East Africa.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointed out that,even if the whole of the War Aims he had indicated in Europe werefulfilled, Germany would still remain the biggest military Power inEurope, and that those War Aims were, therefore, such as germany could, in the last resort, accept if beaten.(A full report of the discussion will be circulated as a separatedocument.)2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,jAugust 15, 1918.
