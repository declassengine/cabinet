2The Western 1. THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that theFront, movement of troops on the Western Front was proceeding accord-ing to programme. In a report which had just been receivedfrom General Sir John Adye, at Spa, it was said that the german troops were passing through on their way to Germany in orderly and well-disciplined formation, in good condition, and not at alllike a broken army.In reply to a question, General Wilson said that it was verydifficult to give a satisfactory explanation of the German collapse.There seemed no doubt that during the last six months we had beenoverestimating the strength of the enemy. He had been informedthat in the last few days of hostilities the German machine-gunnershad refused to fight.Sir Robert Borden suggested that one explanation was to besought in the failing spirit of the German people.The Situation inthe Baltic.Our Attitudetowards theex-Kaiser.2. With reference to Imperial War Cabinet 38, Minute 3,Admiral Fremantle stated that he had been directed by the first sea Lord to ask the Imperial War Cabinet for the instructions which they wished given to the squadron which was being sent tothe Baltic. The squadron was due to arrive at Copenhagen that morning. Arms were being embarked on a vessel at Rosyth, and she would be ready to sail on Saturday. The Admiralty wishedto be informed of the Governments policy, particularly in relationto the Bolsheviks, as to whether or not naval support was to begiven to the Esthonians in resisting the Bolsheviks. Further, ifGermans were co-operating with the Esthonians in opposing theBolsheviks, were we to assist the Germans ? .The Imperial War Cabinet decided To adjourn the consideration of this subject until the Secre-tary of State for Foreign Affairs could be present.3. With reference to Imperial War Cabinet 37, Minute 9,the Prime Minister said that an early decision was required as towhat action should be taken in respect of the ex-Kaiser. M.Clemenceau was coming here on Sunday next, and Mr. LloydGeorge wished to be fortified in any discussions on the subject withthe views of the Imperial War Cabinet. The French Government,he knew, was strongly in favour of taking steps to punish the ex-Kaiser. The Law Officers of the Crown had been asked to express their views, and a very powerful legal Committee had been called together to consider the matter. He understood that this Com-mittee had come to a unanimous decision. -The Attorney-General&apos;s remarks are given at full length inthe Appendix, and the following is merely a summary. He pointedout that the Law Officers regarded this matter as one of some considerable delicacy, and had asked for time to consider it. lord curzon, who had conveyed to the Law Officers the desire of theImperial War Cabinet that they, should consider the Question, had told him that probably ten days would be available for doing so.Only four or five days of the ten days had already elapsed, and inconsequence he hoped that the Imperial War Cabinet would excuseany shortcomings in the conclusions arrived at. The matter was partly a legal one and partly a question of policy. He would liketo point out that there was a choice between two diametricallyopposite courses, which were :-(a.)&quot;To grant impunity to the ex-Kaiser.(&amp;.) To punish him.It was difficult to see how we could justify the first course, as theex-Kaiser had been the supreme authority in Germany, and the
public statements made by him during the war would appear fully to warrant his trial. The ex-Kaiser was, in his opinion, respon-sible for the death of millions of young men, and of a loss of wealthwhich was greater than the loss caused by Napoleon in twenty years. What was an even more serious charge, in his opinion, wasthat the ex-Kaiser had, during the war, made a daring challenge to international law. In the circumstances, it was difficult to see how anyone could justify granting him impunity for his actions.The Attorney-General asked if it was proposed to try the ex-&apos;Kaiser&apos;s subordinates, such as the commanders of submarines, &amp;c.His own view was that these people must be tried, and he did not see how this could be done if the &quot; All-Highest &quot; were grantedImpunity. The Attorney-General then read an extract from&apos;&apos; Burke &apos;&apos; to support his contention that the supreme head of a nation must be held responsible, in certain circumstances, for the actions of the nation. Sir F. E. Smith pointed out that if theex-Kaiser were not put on his trial the lower classes would un-doubtedly say that he had been let off such a trial because he was an Emperor, and it was most undesirable at the present time togive anyone an opportunity of saying this. In his opinion it was essential that a ruler, if he were tempted to countenance actions in contravention of international law, should know that by so doinghe was gambling with his own personal safety. The question thenarose, if the ex-Kaiser were to be tried, how were we to get hold of him. The Attorney-General understood that the French Govern-ment thought he could be extradited, but in this view Sir F. E.Smith did not agree. He did not think it was necessary, however,to ask Holland to extradite the ex-Kaiser when we had a muchmore powerful weapon in our hands. Holland would have to. give him up if the Allied Powers said they wanted him.Again, on the assumption that we had got hold of the ex-Kaiser, what action was to be taken to bring him to trial ? Firstly,he might be treated by the Allies as Napoleon was, and impeachedfor being guilty of high crimes, such as breaking the peace of theworld, and he might be banished or otherwise punished. Secondly,he might be tried by an International Court. There were certain advantages, from the moral point of view, on the side Of the latter course, but at the same time this course would involve many diffi-culties, for it would be at once asked how was the Court to be constituted : was it to include neutrals and Germans % the attorney-General&apos;s own view was that it should only includecitizens of Allied countries.Sir F. E. Smith then pointed out that he would, no doubt, beasked for what offences the ex-Kaiser should be tried. Firstly, he might, as some people suggested, be tried for his responsibility forthe war as a whole, viz., the origin of the war. This course would raise a very big question, and the last thing in the world in whichwe wanted to be involved was a trial of great length, such as thatof Warren Hastings. In such a charge a German advocate couldenlarge very considerably, and prolong the proceedings, and in theopinion of the Attorney-General such a general charge would notbe wise. Secondly, the ex-Kaiser could be charged for his respon-sibility for the invasion of Belgium and all the suffering which hadtaken place in consequence, and also for his responsibility in approving of submarine warfare. The latter warfare had led to the  murder of thousands of women and children on ships whichwere not carrying any warlike stores.It was vital, in the opinion of the Attorney-General, to doevervthing possible to deter nations from adopting this kind of warfare in the future. Sir F. E. Smith again urged, the import-ance of a man who takes a responsibilitv on himself knowing thathe would be held personally accountable, and also again emphasised-sised that, as regards submarine warfare, the subordinate com-manders ought not to be tried unless the ex-Kaiser was also put
on his trial. Of the above two courses the Attorney-General wa&amp;in favour of the second, as being, in his opinion, infinitely clearerthan the first.Sir F. E. Smith then went on to say that the Law Officers ofthe Crown were not entitled to delegate their responsibilities, andhad arrived at their conclusions without reference to the Com-mittee which had been appointed to consider the question. Hethen read to the Imperial War Cabinet the names of the membersof the Committee, and pointed out that the Lord Chief Justiceagreed that a stronger Committee could not have been formed toconsider the matter. It was a point of great satisfaction to theLaw Officers to know that the Committee had unanimously arrivedat the same conclusion to which they had come, viz., that the ex-Kaiser should be tried. The Attorney-General proposed, in oom-sultation with the Solicitor-General, to put his view:s in writing.The Solicitor-General associated himself with the statement ofthe Attorney-General, to which he wished to add nothing.The Prime Minister said that, unless someone dissented, he-proposed to adopt the report of the Law Officers, which had been so ably stated by the Attorney-General, and supported by the solicitor-General. We were not concerned with the method bywhich the ex-Kaiser should be tried. M. Clemenceau would bein London on Sunday night, and Mr. Lloyd George hoped thatthe Attorney-General would be able to let him have the report- by then.The Attorney-General said he would do his best, but that it did not give much time.Lord Reading asked if it were desirable to make ia public state-ment as to what the British Governments views were concerningthe treatment of the ex-Kaiser without consulting the other AlliedGovernments.The Prime Minister said that he thought that must be left to-him.Sir Robert Borden said that he had been impressed by whatthe Attorney-General had said as to the undesirability of a long-drawn-out trial. He (Sir Robert Borden) suggested that thebest way of bringing the ex-Kaiser to justice might be by a resolu-tion of the Peace Conference.The Attorney-General said that he had tried, in his state-ment, to make clear that this was one way in which it might bedone.The Prime Minister said that, before considering- any detailsof that description, it would be necessary to wait until the reports had been received.The Imperial War Cabinet adopted the report presented bythe Attorney-General, and agreed that, so far as theBritish Government have the power, the ex-Kaiser shouldbe held personally responsible for his crimes against inter-national law.4. The Prime Minister said that he wanted the Imperial WarCabinet to consider the question of the measures for revictuallingAllied, enemy, and neutral countries. He had been pressing lord reading to take charge of the matter pending his return to theUnited States. As.President Wilson was coming to Europe itwas not necessary for Lord Reading to return to the United states at present. If the Imperial War Cabinet agreed, he would askLord Reading to take the matter in hand, and it would have to beregarded as very urgent.Lord Reading said that he was not at all sure that he wouldhave time to do it, as he had a considerable amount of work to do.The Prime Minister pressed Lord Reading to take the matter in hand, as Lord Robert Cecil was not now available to do it.Co-ordination of measures fore,   victuallingAllied, Enemy, and neutral Countries.
Lord Reading said it meant really acting as a High Commis-sioner, as so many questions were involved. He was of opinionthat a decision in the-matter should, at any rate, be arrived at that day.The Prime Minister said he felt that we were not, for the timebeing, being represented.   .(At this point the discussion was  discontinued, but was resumed later in the Meeting, as described below.)Lord Reading said that the American delegates, Mr. Hoover,and Mr. Hurley, who had passed through here on their way to france , had come over with the idea that they were not to attendany Allied Conferences unless forced to do so. Lord Readingpointed out, therefore, that we were faced with the difficulty that,while Prance, Italy, and ourselves had agreed that German dele-gates should come to London to discuss questions of food, Mr.Hoover, as representing the United States, wanted any suchmeeting to take place in Brussels. It was just possible that thereason Mr. Hoover took this view was because he had been associated with the Belgian Relief Committee.Mr. Barnes asked if the existing machinery could not be used1in the present case.Lord Reading replied that it was possible. His idea was thatone person should take charge on the Continent, and he hadsounded Mr. Hoover to see if he would be willing to do so, but hehad said no, as he had to return to the United States. Proma report which he had seen in the papers, Mr. Hoover had apparently (announced^ in an interview, that the deliberationswould take place in Brussels. It was very desirable thatwe should come to a definite conclusion as to what we wanted to do, in order to avoid our arranging one thingand the United States another. It was also very, important, as amatter of principle, that we should not allow the United Stages tothink that she could dictate to us in these matters.The Prime Minister said that he supposed the United states could claim that 90 per cent, of the food supply came from america. Could anyone say how much of the shipping necessaryto carry it would be American ?Lord Reading said it was difficult for him to say, but possibly the American proportion was about 40 per cent, to 60 per cent.British. It was also necessary to bear in mind the question offinance. Ever since our telegram about the &quot;Freedom of these as &quot; President Wilson had appeared to want to keep a freehand, so that if he did not agree with us he could go his own way.The United States was in a very powerful position as regardsfinance, food, &amp;c.The Prime Minister asked if it would be possible for theUnited States to get their troops back to America without our assistance in shipping.Lord Reading said it certainly would be possible, although it,would possibly take three times as long. He said it was essentialthat we should make it clear that they must work with us, or elsethe danger was that they would go entirely on their own. IfAmerica agreed on her own to supply the necessary food she wouldprobably say that she wanted the assistance of all enemy ships that were available.Mr. Bonar Law said that it would create a very difficult situation to have the United States acting independently of theAllied Powers.Mr. Long stated that the Minister of Commerce at Washing-ton had made a verv strong speech, in which he pointed out tb&quot;sacrifices that Great Britain bad made during the war as comparedwith the United States, and that he had asked if the United States[530-18] C
was now going to be selfish and try to have her own way. Mr.Long suggested that this showed a division of opinion in theUnited States.Lord Reading did not agree as to the division of opinion in theUnited States, and said that the President was doing everything in his power to prevent, now that the war was over, everyonein the United States trying to be first in the field as regardstrade. What he wanted, however, was to be independent and tohave a free hand in the peace discussions.Mr. Long pointed out that the British Government hadalready come to various decisions as regards their attitude at thePeace Conference, and a good many of these decisions would nowbe of little value, owing to the attitude of the United States.Lord Reading pointed out that the United States pendulummoved very freely, and that, now that the war was over, businessmen were thinking of trade. He again pointed out that PresidentWilson wanted to have a free hand in the peace discussions.Mr. Bonar Law thought that there was more in the Presi-president&apos;s mind than that, and that there seemed to be a tendency for him to use his power to make the Allied Powers do as he wished.The Prime Minister remarked that the attitude of PresidentWilson was not a very good beginning for the League of Nations,neither was the United States&apos; Naval Programme.Mr. Hughes pointed out that there must be joint action. Wemust make it clear that we could not support President Wilsonand also allow him to be independent when he chose. The ques-tion of whether the deliberations as regards foods should take placein London or Brussels appeared to him to be subsidiary to themain question, and if we insisted on having them in London itmight lead to friction without doing much to gain bur main point.Lord Reading said that he was most anxious to avoidAmerica going on her own as opposed to France, Italy, and GreatBritain.The Prime Minister said he had no doubt that Lord Readingwould handle. the question with his usual tact and judgment.He did not consider it advisable to fetter ham with any special instructions from the Imperial War Cabinet, but thought it wouldbe better to give him a free hand. He expressed the thanks of theImperial War Cabinet to Lord Reading for undertaking this responsibility.The Imperial War Cabinet agreed that (a.) Lord Reading (who accepted the invitation) should take charge, until his return to the United States ofAmerica, of the co-ordination of all arrangements forthe relief and re-victualling and supplying of Allied,neutral, and enemy countries, acting in these matters as High Commissioner with full powers on behalf ofthe British Government. Lord Reading&apos;s authority will extend to the co-ordination, so far as the BritishGovernment is concerned, of the action of all Alliedbodies dealing with this question. Lord Reading willbe the principal British Representative on the allied maritime Transport Council, and will act as chairmanin London of this body. His authority will extend alsoto the arrangements for placing enemy merchant ship-ping at the disposal of the Council;(b.) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should makea communication to this effect to our Allies as necessary.Imprisonment ofJohn Maclean.5. With reference to War Cabinet 364, Minute 14, theImperial War Cabinet had before them a-Note by Mr. Barnes(Paper G.T.-6379) regarding the imprisonment of John Maclean.
Mr. Barnes said that he thought that the continued agitationabout this man constituted a serious danger for the Government,and no good purpose was being served by keeping him in prison.Maclean&apos;s supporters were threatening to take very drastic steps,e.g., cutting off the light on the Clyde, if his release were not brought about. Also there were to be big meetings at the AlbertHall on Saturday and Sunday next, in which Mr. Lansbury wouldtake part, and Mr. Barnes was of opinion that the Maclean case would figure largely in the programme of these meetings. Mr.Barnes added that he understood the Secretary for Scotland wouldbe willing for Maclean to be released if it was a matter of generalamnesty. But the position was that in England and Wales therewere no political prisoners, like Maclean, under the Defence of the realm Regulations, and only two in Scotland, one being Macleanand the other a man called Milne.Mr. Long said that the release of Maclean affected the posi-tion of the Sinn-Fein prisoners, as they were imprisoned for thesame offence, i.e., sedition.The Prime Minister pointed out, however, that the case of the sinn-Feiners was somewhat different, inasmuch as they had beenimprisoned for active rebellion and conspiracy with Germany.Mr. Bonar Law said he had been impressed by what Lord!French had said at a previous Cabinet Meeting, which was to theeffect that if prisoners in Great Britain, who had been arrested forthe same offence as the Sinn-Feiners, were released, it would make his (Lord French&apos;s) task an impossible one. Mr. Bonar Law was,however, in favour of Maclean&apos;s release, provided it did not com-plicate the position of the Sinn-Feiners.. Mr. Montagu expressed the view that it was more than desir-able to release John Maclean. After the meetings, ttoi which Mr.Barnes had referred at the Albert Hall, it. would be impossible to release him, and therefore it was a question of doing it now ornot at all. Mr. Montagu added that all the signs pointed to a fight between the Government and those who defied its authority,and that it would be far better to take the fight on some impor-tant issue than on the right to freedom after an armistice had been signed of this one comparatively unimportant man.Lord Cave said that Maclean was backed by the revolution-aries in South Wales and London, and, should he be released, theserevolutionaries would certainly regard it as a triumph, and wouldprobably send Maclean to make revolutionary speeches in Londonand elsewhere.Mr. Hughes said he was in favour of Maclean&apos;s release. The-Sinn-Feiners were distinct from the so-called Bolsheviks. Macleanwas a political prisoner and had the whole of the Trade Unionistsbehind him.The Imperial War Cabinet decided that (a.) The Secretary of State for the Colonies should that after-noon place himself in communication with the chief secretary for Ireland, and inform him that the cabinet would like to release Maclean, provided it would haveno harmful effect in Ireland. If the Irish Govern-ment should not raise strong objections, Macleanshould be at once released. Should, however, the IrishGovernment think that it would make their positionimpossible, then the matter should come again beforethe Cabinet on the following day;(&amp;.) The above decision should also apply to the case ofCharles Milne, mentioned by Mr. Barnes in the Memo-ran dum under discussion.!2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,November 28, 1918.&apos;
APPENDIX.(G.T.-6411.) -Statement by the Attorney-General.SIR FREDERICK SMITH: Prime Minister, Lord Curzon conveyed to the Law-Officers of the Crown some days ago the desire of &quot;the Cabinet that they should give their opinion on this matter. The Law Officers pointed out the extreme importance,delicacy, and difficulty of the matter submitted to them, and the fact that they them-selves were very much engaged in other matters, and asked what period of time could resonably be allowed them to produce a written opinion adequate to the gravity of thetopic. Lord Curzon at that time took the view that they might be allowedten days. Well, of these ten days, only, I think, four or five have elapsed, andtherefoi-e the Cabinet will excuse any imperfection Of form in the statement Iam about to make. We have, however, arrived at a clear conclusion, other-wise we should have informed the Cabinet that we were not yet in a positionto give definite and final advice. The matters involved here are partly legal andpartly matters of policy. So far as they are matters of policy, the Cabinet will ofcourse merely treat our views as the opinions of colleagues who are not entitled to,and who are not claiming, any special -weight. The main question here which we, in common with our Allies, have to consider is whether the taking of proceedings against,or any punitive treatment in relation to, the Kaiser should become the declared policyof the Government. The Law Officers of the Crown answer this question in the affirmative. They point out to the Cabinet that the choice now to be taken is between two diametrically opposed courses, and that no half-way house is possible in the matter.The first is a decision in favour of complete impunity, an impunity which will be described as luxurious and wealthy ; the second is in favour of punishment. We wish the Cabinetto consider very carefully how it will be possible for them to justify a decision in favourof impunity. The ex-Kaiser&apos;s personal responsibility and supreme authority inGermany have been constantly asserted by himself, and his assertions are fullywarranted by the constitution of Germany. Accepting, as we must, this view, we are bound to take notice of the conclusion which follows : namely, that the ex-Kaiser is primarily and personally responsible for the death of millions of young men ; for thedestruction in four years of 200 times as much material wealth as Napoleon destroyed in twenty years ; and he is responsible and this is not the least grave part of theindictment for the most daring and dangerous challenge to the fundamental principles of public law which that indispensable charter of international right hassustained since its foundations were laid centuries ago by Grotius. These things arevery easy to understand, and ordinary people all over the world understandthem very well. How then, I ask, are we to justify impunity? Underwhat pretext, and with what degree of consistence, are we to try smallercriminals ? Is it still proposed it has been repeatedly threatened bythe responsible representatives of every Allied country to try, in appropriate cases,,submarine commanders and to bring to justice the governors of prisons ? Is it proposed to indict the murderers of Captain Fryatt ? In my view, you must answerall these questions in the affirmative. I am at least sure that the democracies of theworld will take that view, and among them I have no doubt that the American people will be numbered. How can you do this if, to use the title claimed by himself, and initself illustrative of. my argument, &quot; the All Highest&quot; is given impunity? Must wenot, at the moment of our triumph, avoid the sarcasm : &quot; Dat veniam corvis, vexat censuracolumbas &quot; ? In order to illustrate the point which is in my mind I will read to theImperial War Cabinet a very short extract, which represents our view with admirableeloquence, from Burke&apos;s speech in the trial of Warren Hastings : &quot; We have not brought before you an obscure offender, who, when his-insignificance and weakness are weighed against the power of the prosecutiongives even to public justice something of the appearance of oppression ; no, myLords, we have brought before you the first man of India in rank, authority, andstation. We have brought before you the chief of the tribe, the head of thewhole body of eastern offenders; a captain-general of iniquity, under whom allthe fraud, all the peculation, all the tyranny in India are embodied, disciplired
arrayed, and paid. This is the person, my Lords, that we bring before you. Wehave brought before you such a person, that, if you strike at him with the firm,and decided arm of justice, you will not have need of a great many moreexamples.   You strike at the whole corps if you strike at the head.&quot;Prime Minister, in my judgment, if this man escapes, common people will sayeverywhere that he has escaped because he is an Emperor. In my judgment they willbe right. They will say that august influence has been exerted to save him. It isnot desirable that such things should be said, especially in these days. Itis necessary for all time to teach the lesson that failure is not the only risk which aman possessing at the moment in any country despotic powers, and taking the awfuldecision between Peace and War, has to fear. If ever again that decision should be suspended in nicely balanced equipoise, at the disposition of an individual, let the rulerwho decides upon war know that he is gambling, amongst other hazards, with his ownpersonal safety.For these reasons we think the ex-Kaiser should be punished. If this view is accepted,the question arises : How is his person to be secured ? And the question has been asked,and will be asked, whether or not he can be extradited. Now, Sir, the French haveapparently expressed the view that he can. My own clear opinion is that that view iswrong, and I think my colleague, the Solicitor-General, is, on the whole, of the same opinion ; but it is not necessary to argue that question, because we do not propose to involve ourselves in a doubtful technical argument when we have more powerful weaponsat our disposal. Infinite vistas of litigious disputations are opened by an argumentwhether according to the law of Holland he can be extradited or not. And if, contraryto my opinion, he could be extradited, he could only be charged for the very offence(possibly a limited one) which had been successfully alleged as the ground in law&apos;of his extradition. I think it is unnecessary to ask whether in law we canextradite him, because it seems to me that Holland must, in effect, give himup. The League of Nations, or the Conference of the Allies which willprecede the formation of the League of Nations, has, or will have,powerful arguments to address to Holland, and the internal condition of Holland&apos;seems to me to be such that it would be very difficult for her to reject arguments of the kind indicated. This is not a point of law, but my own conclusion is that thedifficulty of obtaining control of the person of the ex-Kaiser from Holland will not bean insuperable one, though I should naturally defer to the views of the Foreign Officeupon such a point.. It may perhaps be assumed that the difficulty will not arise whichwould be occasioned in this connection by the ex-Kaisers return to Germany. the taking of unnecessary risks has not up to the present been a distinguishing feature ofhis career. Different considerations might arise if the reconstitution of germany should really bring with it an honest desire to deal with the Kaiser themselves.The few observations, therefore, which I have still to make will be made upon theassumption that it will be possible to obtain control of his person. 1 have made it clearthat in our judgment control should not be sought through the machinery of extradition.Supposing control of his person has been obtained, how is he to be dealt with ? Thereare two alternative courses. In the first place, he might be treated by the Allies asNapoleon was treated, that is to say, by a high assertion of responsibility on the part ofthe conquering nations. The Allies might say : We are prepared, before the bar of history, to take upon ourselves the responsibility for saying that this man has been guilty of high crimes and misdemeanours, that he has broken the peace of the world,and that he ought either to be exiled or otherwise punished in his own person. that course may be recommended by powerful argument, and I do not myself exclude it,Prime Minister. I do not say more of it at this stage than this, that by its adoptionwe should avoid the risks of infinite delays and of a long drawn out impeachment.We should carry with us the sanction and support of the overwhelming mass ofcivilisation. And we are bold enough to feel that we have nothing to fear from the judgment of the future. It is even possible as Austria and Germany will be reconstituted that there will be few dissentients in the governing classes of thesecountries.The second alternative is that he should be tried by a Court which must evidentlybe international in its composition. There are obvious advantages in this methodupon the moral side if this method of dealing with the situation be carried to a logicalconclusion. It is, of course, very desirable that we should be able to say that this manreceived fair-play, and that he has had a fair trial, but grave difficulties beset thiscourse in its complete application.   In this connection, how is the Court to be[530-18] .&apos; T?
constituted ?   Are neutrals to be members of the Court ? Are Germans to be membersof the Court ?The only advantage of judicial procedure over the other alternative-a highexercise of executive and conquering force submitting itself to the judgment of history lies in the fact that for all time it may claim the sanction of legal forms andthe protection in favour of the prisoner of a tribunal whose impartiality can beestablished in the face of any challenge. This advantage, it must be observed, largelydisappears if the fairness of the tribunal can be plausibly impeached. The Law &apos;Officers are not, indeed, of opinion that before a tribunal which consisted in part even of Germans, as Germany appears to be developing to-day, an indictment would neces-sarily fail. But it is unwise to ignore the difficulties. German and neutral represen-tation would undoubtedly be claimed by the Kaiser. We can only qualify the:consequent risk by saying that the German representatives would certainly be lessGerman than they were, and the neutral representatives less neutral.If a court be constituted, I confess that I myself incline on the whole to theView that the members of the court should consist only of citizens of the allied countries. Grave judges should be appointed, but we should, as it seems to meat present, take the risk of saying that in this quarrel we, the Allies, taking ourstand upon the universally admitted principles of the moral law, take our ownstandards of right and commit the trial of them to our own tribunals.I cannot, because time is short, develop the matter as I should like now, andtherefore I merely place it on record that I am well aware that the opposite view maybe supported by formidable arguments.The great question which I shall probably be asked and here again inter-Allieddiscussion will be necessary is: For what offences, in your view (assuming theadoption of judicial proceedings), should the ex-Kaiser be made justiciable ? Thefirst charge which will occur to many persons is one which raises in limine thequestion of his responsibility for the origin of the war. Well, Sir, I can only say,without giving a decision, that the trial of such a charge would involve infinitedisputation. We do not wish to become involved in a trial like that of WarrenHastings in its infinite duration. We do not wish to be confronted by a meticulousexamination of the history of European politics for the past twenty years. It is veryeasy to see that no German advocate of the ex-Kaiser would find it difficult to enlargethe area of discussion, carrying it to what would be described in Germany as the&quot; ringing round &quot; system, and discursively spreading from the question of the. origin of the war to a close discussion of the military significance of the Russian strategicrailways. The view which I have at present is that it would not be wise to add sogeneral a charge, but this provisional view might easily be modified if new and decisivedocuments were produced, like those recently disclosed by the Bavarian Minister, whowas in Berlin in August 1914.   Such revelations are very likely to be made.The second charge is extremely clear, and it is, in my judgment, a decisive one.A count should certainly be inserted in the indictment charging the Kaiser with responsibility for the invasion of Belgium in breach of International Law and for all the consequent criminal acts which took place. That is an absolutely clear issue, and upon .it I do not think that any honest tribunal could hesitate. It is even possible, obscure asthe present position in Germany is, that a partly German tribunal convened under .existing circumstances in Germany would reach the same conclusion.The next charge, m my judgment, which should be brought against him is that heis responsible in the matter of unrestricted submarine warfare. It may be necessaryto associate other defendants in this charge. But it will, in my judgment, be absoulutely impossible for us to charge or punish any subordinate if the ex-Kaiserescapes with impunity all responsibility for the submarine warfare. I wish to pressmost strongly upon my colleagues certain fundamental considerations in regard tosubmarine warfare, as it has been carried on since the incident of the&quot;Lusitania.&quot; Since then thousands of women and children, in our clear and frequently expressed view, have been brutally murdered. I am dealing withthe case where a ship is torpedoed carrying no munitions of war, but which it is known must or may be carrying women and children, and whereit is equally known that such. passengers had no possible means of escape, and I do-not in this connection deal with the vile cases of assassination when helpless boats,vainly attempting to escape, have been fired on and destroyed. Excluding the lastclass of cases, it is our view, and the view of the whole civilised world, that those actsamount to murder. It is surely vital that if ever there is another war, whether in tenor fifteen years, or however distant it may be, those responsible on both sides for the
1148conduct of that war should be made to feel that unrestricted submarine warfare hasbeen so branded with the punitive censure of the whole civilised world that it hasdefinitely passed into the category of international crime. &quot; If I do it and fail,&quot; theTirpitz of the next war must say, &quot; I too shall pay for it in my own person.&quot; How can we best secure that no one in future will dream of resorting to submarine warfare ofthis kind ? You can best secure it by letting the whole world know that, by the unanimous consent of the whole of that part of the civilised world whichhas conquered in this war, the man responsible for those acts is responsible inhis own person for that which he has done. To us of all people it is not possible to exaggerate the weight and force of these considerations. Nothing more vitallyconcerns these islands than that it should be recognised that these acts are crimes. Thecommission of such crimes, and their possible future development, menace us more,directly than any other nation in the world.The above are suggestions, and not necessarily exhaustive suggestions, in regard tothe offences for which the Kaiser should be tried. There are other individual caseswith which I do not think it necessary to trouble the Cabinet at this stage.It is true that the Prime Minister authorised me to form a Committee to report upon these matters, but the Law Officers obviously cannot place their responsibility for advising the Government in legal matters in the hands of anybody else, and they havearrived at their conclusions independently of the conclusions of this1 Committee, and,indeed, before they were informed of them. I think I ought to point out who are themembers who compose this- Committee, which is the Sub-Committee on Law of theMain Committee.,. They are as follows : Professor J. H. Morgan (Chairman).Sir John Macdonnell (Chairman of the Main Committee).Sir Frederick Pollock.Sir Alfred Hopkinson, K.C.Mr. C. A. Russell, K.C.Dr. Pearce Higgins.Mr. Justice Peterson.Mr. C. F. Gill, K.C.Mr. J. F. More (of the War Office).Of these, Sir John Macdonnell, Mr. Justice Peterson, and Mr. Gill are not members ofthe Sub-Committee on Law, but were called in for the special purpose of discussing the new issue as regards the ex-Kaiser.I think the Lord Chief Justice will agree that it would not be possible in thiscountry to form a stronger Committee for the purpose of arriving at a soundconclusion upon such matters. It is a source of satisfaction to the Law officers that this Committee has unanimously and independently of. them reached the&apos;conclusion that the ex-Kaiser ought to be punished, either by way , of trial or asNapoleon was punished. The Committee inclines to the first of those courses, namely,that he should be tried. I am not at present wholly convinced irpon this point,and, in the written opinion which the Solicitor-General and myself contemplate,we propose to discuss this matter in greater detail. Probably I have said enough tomake the Cabinet aware of the views held by the Law Officers. I could, and would,have said much more if I were not concerned to be economical of your time. as chief Law Officer of the Crown, I say quite plainly that I should feel the greatest difficulty in being responsible in any way for the trial of subordinate criminals if theex-Kaiser is allowed to escape.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,November 28, 1918.o
