ARRANGEMENTS EOR THE ARMY OF OCCUPATION IN GERMANY.MR. LLOYD GEORGE read the text of a resolution based on the discussion at the Allied conversation held at 11.15 a.m. on the .same day. The resolution,which reads as follows, was accepted without discussion: The British Government agreed to the proposal of Marshal Foch that the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff should confer with the Marshal in regardto the detailed arrangements for the British portion of the Army of Occu-pation of German territory.THE MILITARY  OCCUPATION  OF AUSTRIAN  TERRITORY.MR. LLOYD GEORGE said that, the representatives of the British, French,and Italian Governments who had taken part that morning in the Allied conver-sation had reached an agreement as regards the military occupation of Austria.He then read a draft of the resolution based on the discussion.SIGNOR ORLANDO expressed some doubt as to whether the wording of theresolution as read by Mr. Lloyd George gave effect quite correctly to the conclusions which had been reached during the morning&apos;s discussion. The discussion whichhad taken place in the morning referred to the number of troops, whereas the reso-lution involved other questions. He was not certain if the alteration made by thesubstitution of the words &quot; the Italian Commander-in-Chief and General franchet d&apos;Esperey &quot; for the words &quot; the Italian Commander-in-Chief and the militaryauthorities of the other Allies concerned,&quot; which had been erased, really improved,the resolution. The question of the composition of the French and British forces which were to occupy certain territories, and how they were to be used, was not one which could be decided by the Italian Commander-in-Chief and Generald&apos;Esperey. In the territories which affected the Italian Commander-in-chief the question was one which purely affected that Commander and whichever Govern-ment was concerned, and possibly Marshal Foch, and he did not see the necessityfor consulting General Franchet d&apos;Esperey.M. CLEMENCEAU pointed out that it was the question of the occupation of austrian territory which was being discussed.BARON SONNINO said that this was not exactly the point which the Italianrepresentatives wished to raise, and he gave as an example the case of the occupationof Innsbruck. The proportion of the troops.of each nation to be used for such an occupation affected each Commander and his respective Government, and possiblyMarshal Foch and General Diaz, but it did not concern General franchet d&apos;Esperey.MARSHAL FOCH said that General Diaz was only concerned with discus-sions affecting his own particular theatre of operations, and in such a case it wasnot suggested that he would have to consult General Franchet d&apos;Esperey, and vice versa. He fully realised the point raised by Baron Sonnino, and he thought the text of the resolution should be amended so as to make it quite clear.MR. LLOYD GEORGE suggested that it would be better to alter the resolution to make it read so that each General would be responsible.for the arrangements inhis own sphere.BARON SONNINO thought the difficulty would be in defining exactly whateach sphere was, and asked if it would not be possible to refer such questions tothe Supreme War Council.MR. LLOYD GEORGE said it was a case for each Commander to make hisown proposals, which should be submitted to Marshal Foch, who, in his turn, would submit them to the Government concerned!. Mr. Lloyd George then read anamended draft of the resolution, which he suggested should be agreed to.BARON SONNINO suggested a further amendment, and the substitution, in-one place of the text, of the words &quot; military authorities of the Governments oon-oeraed.&quot;
MR. LLOYD GEORGE said, in reply, that, to take the case of Lord Cavan,he was under General Diaz, and there was to him no question that General Diazwould naturally consult Lord Cavan.After some discussion as to the wording of the resolution, MR. LLOYDGEORGE, at the suggestion of M. Clemenceau, finally read the resolution, whichran as follows, and was agreed to: The British, French, and Italian Governments agreed that the arrangementsfor the military occupation of Austria, as provided for in the Austrianarmistice, are primarily a military question for arrangement respectivelyby the Italian Commander-in-Chief and General Franehet d&apos;Esperey, whowill consult together when necessary. The military proposals, whenformulated, should be submitted to the Governments concerned, throughMarshal Foch.REPRESENTATION OF RUSSIA AT THE PEACE CONFERENCE.MR. LLOYD GEORGE read a resolution, based on the discussion at theAllied conversation, with regard to the representation of Russia at the Peace Con-ference.The British, French, and Italian Governments agreed that no resolution could usefully be reached in regard to the representation of Russia at the Inter-allied conference or Peace Conference, in the absence of any representative of the Govern-ment of the United States of America, except as provided for in 4 (e) of the Con-clusions of the 2nd December.MR. LLOYD GEORGE then said that his idea was that it would be bettersimply to record no conclusion at all, and merely put the gist of the resolution inthe proces-verbal of the conversation.Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s proposal was agreed to.MR. BALFOUR said that, in the absence of any representatives of the UnitedStates of America,&quot; he hoped that all the conclusions arrived at would be treated asprovisional.MR. LLOYD GEORGE said that this question would be considered later on.INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS,. LABOUR, AND OTHER CONFERENCES.MR. LLOYD GEORGE read the terms of a resolution which had been preparedto give effect to the discussion at the meeting held that morning, concerning Inter-national Religious, Labour, and other Conferences.LORD CURZON suggested that the text as it stood was too wide, and suggested the omission of the words &quot;at any time.&quot;MR. HUGHES agreed that these words were not required. ,MR. BARNES suggested that the resolution should be more definite, and shouldlink up the Religious, Labour, and other Conferences more closely with the PeaceConference. Further, he suggested that the Religious, Labour, and other Conferencesshould be free to refer to the Peace Conference at any time.MR. LLOYD GEORGE said that he was not sure if it was desirable to alter the resolution in this sense. He pointed out that Lord Curzon had suggested apreamble being added to the resolution, somewhat to the effect; &quot; Whereas representa-tions have been received from Religious, Labour, and other bodies, the Conferencedecide ...&quot;LORD READING suggested that, instead of a preamble, it would be sufficientdf the following words were inserted in the resolution: &quot;agreed with regard-to the applications received from Religious, Labour  ...  .&quot;MR. BARNES again suggested that the Religious and Labour Conferencesshould be able to make representations to the Peace Conference, and said that what he wanted done, in the case of our Government, was the same as M. Clemenceauhad done in the case of France.[1070-9] B 2
MR. LLOYD GEORGE said that there could be no objection to allowing repre--sentations to be made to the Peace Conference, but he thought it was very dangerous to have too much to do with these &quot; Soviets.&quot;MR. CHAMBERLAIN said the matter was one for consideration by each government, and that naturally each Government would consult its Labour repre-sentatives before discussing questions at the Peace Conference.The resolution, of which the following is the text, was then agreed to: The British, French, and Italian Governments agreed that they will place no obstacle in the way of an International Religious, Labour1, or any otherConference in relation to the Peace Conference being held, provided that,until peace is signed, it is held in a neutral country.THE VICTUALLING&apos;AND SUPPLY OF ENEMY, ALLIED, AND neutral countries.MR. LLOYD GEORGE explained that the question of the victualling and supply of enemy, Allied, and neutral countries was one which had, up to date, been dealt with by an Inter-Allied body composed of French, British, Italian, and american representatives. Mr. Hoover had now come on the scene and suggestedthat the supply of neutral, liberated, and enemy countries should be placed underhim as Director-General, and that he should be under the Supreme War Council at versailles. The latter proposal was not practicable, in the opinion of Mr. LloydGeorge, as the Supreme War Council met only once a month, whereas the Inter-Allied Council met frequently. If Mr. Hoover&apos;s suggestion was agreed to, he wouldbe in practical control of all the food supplies. Mr. Hoover was a most able adminis-trator, and might be relied on to make sure that those countries for whose supply hewas responsible were thoroughly well catered for. One result would be that the Allied;countries would only get what was left over. Some system of joint Allied control would seem a better foundation for the League of Nations. Broadly speaking, barelyone-half of the food supply came from America, while one-third came from GreatBritain, and the rest froim the Argentine. Mr. Lloyd George then read out a resolu-tion based on the discussion at the Inter-Allied conversation that morning, whichremitted to M; Clementel, Lord Reading, Sir Joseph Maclay, Signor Crespi, SignerVilla, with Mr. Hoover and Mr. Hurley, if available, the examination of thisquestion.M. CLEMENCEAU suggested that M. Bouisson, who was a shipping expert,should be added to the Commission, and this was agreed to.LORD CURZON pointed out the great urgency of this question. Mr. Hooverwas already chartering ships to help Armenia, and this was disorganising the workof the Allied Maritime Transport Council. The adoption of this resolution was,therefore, essential, as action by Mr. Hoover was already being taken in an inde-pendent sense.The resolution, the text of which was as follows, Was then agreed to: The British, French, and Italian Governments remitted to M. Clementel,M. Bouisson, Lord Reading, Sir Joseph Maclay, Signor Crespi, SignorVilla, with Mr. Hoover and Mr. Hurley (if available) the examinationof the question of the victualling and, supply of enemy, Allied, and neutral countries, in its economic, financial, and other aspects, as well as the con-nected question of the handing over to the. Allies of enemy merchant ships,with a view to the preparation of a full report for the consideration of thefour Governments.THE FUTURE OF GENERAL MILNE&apos;S COMMAND.MR. LLOY&apos;D GEORGE then read out a resolution based on the discussion atthe Inter-Allied conversation regarding the future of General Milne&apos;s Command.He said that the resolution simply meant that that portion of General Milne&apos;s force which would be garrisoning European Turkey would remain under the command ofGeneral Franchet d&apos;Espeney. This left, however, a division or two to spare at salonica, and we wished to use some of these in &quot;the Caucasus, because, as everyoneknew, it was not easy to sendtiroops from Mesopotamia to the Caucasus, or&apos; to supply&quot;them from there.  lit was suggested that a separate Command should be established
dn the Caucasus, as the troops operating there could not be under the command ofGeneral Franchet d&apos;Esperey. t&apos;M. CLEMENCEAU said that he must ask for the insertion in the resolution of the words &quot; with the concurrence of the two Governments.&quot; General franchet d&apos;Esperey had already protested against the removal of troops from his command,since it was necessary for him to replace any troops that were taken away. Conse-quently, M. Clemenceau asked that no troops should be removed unless an agree-ment had in the first place been reached by the two Governments.LORD MILNER agreed that no troops would be moved without warningGeneral Franchet d&apos;Esperey.M. CLEMENCEAU pointed out that this would not be sufficient, and he asked that the question might, in the first instance, be discussed between the two Govern-ments. However, as regards the division which, he understood had already been moved he concurred in the suggestion- of Mr. Lloyd George that that should beregarded       fait accompli.MR. LLOYD GEORGE asked the Secretary of State for War if he could not say how many troops it was wanted to move.GENERAL WILSON said that the proposal was to put allthe British gar-risons, which it was necessary to leave in European Turkey, under the orders ofGeneral Franchet d&apos;Esperey, and that those troops who were not required asgarrisons should be moved if necessary.MR. LLOYD GEORGE thought that this was perfectly fair, and, in reply toa question by him, the representatives of France and Italy agreed that the arrange-ments for the removal of a division to the Caucasus might be proceeded with withoutfurther reference.The resolution, of which the following is the text, was then agreed to: The British, French, and Italian Governments agreed that, while the Britishtroops garrisoning any part of European Turkey, and the General-in-Com-mand of them, should remain under General Franchet d&apos; Esperey, the restof General Milne&apos;s army might be transferred to the Caucasus and else-where, and in that case should cease to be under the command of GeneralFranchet d&apos;Esperey. The transfer should be agreed to in each case betweenthe Governments concerned.RESERVATION OF SOME OF THE CONCLUSIONS FOR discussions with THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.MR. LLOYD GEORGE read a resolution regarding the reservation of certain conclusions for discussion with the United States of America,LORD READING suggested the addition of the words &quot; in so far as america is affected.&quot;BARON SONNINO suggested the numbering of the resolutions, and exceptingthose which concerned the United States of America.MR. LLOYD GEORGE thought that this would be the best solution.This was done, and it was agreed to remit the drafting of the resolution to the secretaries, who, after consultation with Mr. Balfour, drew up the following text: The British, French, and Italian Governments agreed that the conclusions reached at their Conferences should be regarded as provisional only andsubject to subsequent discussion and agreement with the United States ofAmerica, except the following, which either require immediate action ordo not concern the United States of American-Meeting, December 2, 11 a.m. (no exception).Meeting December 2, 4 p.m., Resolutions 1 and 2 (immediate action required in each case).Meeting, December 3, 11.15 a.m., Resolution 1 (concerns British andFrench Governments only).Meeting, December 3, 4 p.m., Resolutions 1 and 2.4immediate action required in each case).% Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,December 4, 1918.
