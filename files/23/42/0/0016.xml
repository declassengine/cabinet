2President Wilson. 1. With reference to the forthcoming visit of President Wilsonto London, Mr. Lloyd George said that a telegram had been receivedfrom Lord Derby saying that the&apos;President would leave Paris on the26th December, and would probably remain in England until the30th December. Although the President was ready to discuss matters privately with himself (Mr. Lloyd George) and Mr. Balfour,he would very much object to any conferences at which the PrimeMinister of France or Italy was present. Colonel House had suggested that, if possible, Mr. Lloyd George and Mr. Balfour should carry out their original intention of going to Paris on the 21stDecember, and bad pointed out that, in order to meet Mr. LloydGeorge&apos;s convenience, the President had arranged to keep the 22ndand 23rd December clear of all engagements. . Mr. Lloyd Georgesaid that the President had suddenly altered his plans, and we had altered ours accordingly in order to fit in with his wishes.. PresidentWilson apparently now suggested that he would be put to incon-venience in his arrangements if he (Mr. Lloyd George) and Mr.Balfour did not go to Paris as originally intended. It was absolutely essential to have time to discuss with the Ministers in London thequestions which were coming up at the Peace Conference, and it was quite impossible to go on changing our plans to meet PresidentWilson&apos;s wishes at any moment.Subject to the acquiescence of the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs (who had not yet arrived), the Imperial War Cabinet agreed generally  that  -It was impossible, in the present circumstances, for the PrimeMinister and Mr. Balfour to goto Paris on the 21st Decem-ber, and that Mr. Balfour should reply to Colonel House tothis effect.The Captured 2. The Imperial War Cabinet had before them draft memorandaGerman Colonies. prepared by Sir Erie Richards, under the direction of General Smuts,concerning the treatment of the captured German Colonies (PapersP.-34 and P.-34 A), and a memorandum by the Foreign Office,entitled &quot; The Far East and Non-African Colonies,&quot;-in so far as itaffected Germany&apos;s non-African colonies (Paper G.T.-6507); alsoMr. Long&apos;s memorandum on Paper P. 34 (Paper P. 45).Mr. Lloyd George suggested that the discussion by the imperial war Cabinet should be confined to those colonies as to whose fatethere could be some doubt. One thing was quite certain, and thatwas that none of Germany&apos;s colonies would be returned to her.Another thing that was certain was that those colonies which hadbeen captured by Dominion troops must be retained by the Dominionsconcerned, such as the Pacific colonies south of the Equator, andGerman South-West Africa. It would probably be better, therefore,to begin by discussing East Africa.General Smuts suggested a discussion on all the Central african colonies together. The greater part of Togoland and the Cameroonshad already been given to the French, and it was really only a.question of boundaries.Mr. Balfour hoped that everyone would realise that France wasonly administering Togoland and the Cameroons, and it was quite outof the question that she should start any general discussion byassuming that these colonies had been handed over to her, as wehad not agreed to any such thing.Mr. Lloyd George and General Smuts agreed in this view, andGeneral Smuts said it was quite true that Togoland and the cameroons must be treated on exactly the same footing as the othercolonies at the general discussion. We must do our best to getEast Africa handed over to us, and also those parts of Togoland andthe Cameroons which we wanted.Mr. Long explained to Mr. Lloyd George, with the aid of a map,
mIWC 44the importance of Duala. He pointed out that this was the bestport on the west coast of Africa, and possessed irreat importance as a potential base for coal and oil supplies, and a wireless station. Mr.Long said that Sir Frederick Lugard, who had a very wide knowledge-of African questions, was of opinion that the portions of the Cameroonswhich we had from time to time been anxious to get were of little value, and he would be inclined to give the whole of the Cameroonsa/nd Togoland to France. Further, Sir Frederick contended that the-argument that a certain coast district was wanted as a health resortwas ludicrous, as anyone who wanted such a resort could come toEngland just as easily. He (Mr. Long) was, however, averse from giving up anything.Mr. Lloyd George asked why the Americans should not offer toiiake their share in any control that might be necessary ? He saw noreason why we should be asked to do it all.Mr. Balfour and Mr. Long both called attention to the fact thatthe United States were now objecting to a condominium in connec-tion with a loan from Liberia.Mr. Hughes wished to know what policy we were going to adhere to in the discussions. What he meant was, were we going to start by saying that East Africa was to be handed over to us, or were wegoing to approach it from a different view, and start by saying thatit should be administered by a mandatory Power ? He was averse.from making any demand, to commence with, at the Conference, onwhich we might be beaten and have to give up in the end.Mr. Lloyd George said there was a great deal to be said for thepolicy which had been advocated by Sir Bobert Borden in the summer. Sir Bobert Borden had pointed out that it would create avery bad impression if the British Empire came out of this war with-a great acquisition of territory, and if the United States undertookno new responsibilities. If America were to go away from theConference with her share of guardianship, it would nave a great-effect on the world.Sir Bobert Borden then read extracts from certain speechesmade by President Wilson, in order to show the views which thePresident held. One of the most important assets that we could get-out of the war would be assured goodwill and a clear under-standing between Great Britain and the United States. Therewere very strong elements, such as the German and Irish, in theUnited States which were bitterly opposed to our Empire, and wemust not put into the mouths of these people a plausibleargument that we had gone into the war for territorialaggrandisement. He frankly said that, so far as Canada was con-cerned, she did not go into the war in order to add territory to theBritish Empire. In so far, however, as the colonies conquered bySouth Africa, Australia, and New Zealand were concerned, he wouldbe prepared to support their retention on one consideration, and oneonly, and that was that their acquisition was necessary for thefuture security of the Empire. As regards the remaining conqueredterritories, he was in favour of entrusting their control and dominionto whichever State was appointed as mandatory for that purpose by the League of Nations, on the lines suggested in General Smuts&apos;paper. The mandate would be for the development of thosecountries in the interests of the inhabitants until they were capableof governing themselves. He assumed, of course, that the Frenchand others who had occupied enemy colonies would agree to the-same policy.Lord Curzon suggested that we might be too ready to assume that the United States would be willing to accept these obligations.If she accepted any such responsibilities, she might have to accept them in Constantinople or Armenia before she accepted them in africa.Mr. Lloyd George agreed that this was probable, but that by making the offer to America we would remove any prejudice against
us on the ground of &quot; land-grabbing.&quot; It was not a question ofannexation, but of assuming a responsibility. These territories couldnot be left to be exploited by Arabs or by European capitalistswithout a strong Government to control them. He did not considerthat we could postpone this matter till the League of Nations was actually set up. President Wilson was now inclined to keepGermany out of the League of Nations in the near future, so thatthe League of Nations for the present would, in fact, be nothing morethan the existing Allied Conference. We could hardly put off thequestion till the League of Nations was completed. British and dominion public opinion would not tolerate our giving backterritories after we had held them for nine or ten years, whereas itmight accept a transfer of some of the captured territory as part ofthe general settlement.Mr. Chamberlain pointed out that there were really two questions : firstly, whether we wished to interest the United states in responsibility for backward countries, either in a possessory ora mandatory capacity ; and, secondly, where we wished the Americaninterest to be. Personally, be was all against interesting the UnitedStates in Africa, and considered the East a better and more naturalfield for their activity.Lord milner  suggested that the right beginning would be to start ourselves by advocating the mandatory principle. If that was accepted, we could then invite the United States, in a general way,to become one of the mandatories and share in the &quot; white man&apos;sburden,&quot; before beginning to discuss in detail the particular regionin which she was to exercise her mandate.Mr. Lloyd George agreed, but pointed out that PresidentWilson would, naturally, at once reply by asking us to particularise,and we ought to know, in our own minds, .what territory we wouldbe prepared to part with.A short discussion followed as to the precise distinction betweenthe occupation of a territory in a &quot; possessory &quot; and in a &quot; mandatory &quot;capacity. It was generally agreed that &quot;mandatory occupation&quot;did not involve anything in the nature of condominium orinternational administration, but administration by a single Power-on certain general lines laid down by the League of Nations. , Theselines would naturally include equality of treatment to all nations in respect of tariffs, concessions, and economic policy generally.Similarly, there would be no militarisation, or fortification of theterritory in question. Finally, there would be a right of appeal from the mandatory Power to the League of Nations on the partof anyone who considered himself ill-treated, or claimed that theconditions laid down by the League of Nations were not beingfulfilled. Subject to such appeal, which might involve the Leagueof Nations withdrawing the mandate in the case of deliberateand persistent violation of its conditions, the mandate would becontinuous until such time as the inhabitants of the countrythemselves were fit for self-government.Lord Milner pointed out that the mandatory principle was not altogether an innovation. Our administration of Egypt for thirty-fiveyears was carried on on that principle, and subject to innumerableobligations which we consistently fulfilled, at one time even to the^extent of giving a decided preference to other nations over ourselves.The more we had been able to get rid in Egypt of a condominium,the more satisfactorily were we able to carry out our duties as a mandatory.Lord Reading suggested that, although this was true in fact,,giving Egypt as an example might not altogether appeal either to;France or America. He went on to express the view that. theUnited States might very possibly, while accepting the principle of mandatory occupation, ask what reasons there were why this should.not apply equally to German South-West Africa and the PacificIslands.     Such   occupation  would,   it   might   be   urged,   meet
the main argument as regards the security of the adjacentDominions.Mr. Hughes suggested that, both as regards the Pacific Islands,which were in the immediate neighbourhood of Australia, and presumably in the case of German South-West Africa, thedifferentiating of their occupation from that of the. adjoiningDominion would create insuperable difficulties in respect of customslaws, coastwise trade, methods of economic development, labourlaws, &amp;c. He had made it perfectly clear to President Wilson thatthe demand for the Pacific Islands was being put forward in theinterests of Australian security, and not in the interests of theBritish Empire.Lord Milner urged that the question of South-West Africa andthe Pacific Islands should be treated quite separately from that ofthe other occupied colonies. We should make it clear with regardto them, from the outset, that we treated them as belonging to theDominions concerned.Mr. Lloyd George agreed that the real basis of claim in this case was one of geographical contiguity and security.Mr. Long pointed out that the French certainly meant to stickto the provisional bargain they had made with us over the Gameroonsand Togoland, and expected us to support them in the retention*ofthose territories. The Japanese meant to do the same as regardsthe Pacific Islands north of the Equator. Personally, he consideredthat British public opinion would strongly resent the giving up ofGerman East Africa, unless it were part of a general review of thewhole case of colonial territories captured by the Allies.Mr. Hughes wished to say, for purposes of record, that Australiacould not regard herself as responsible for the position which Japannow held in the North Pacific. In General Smuts&apos; paper, he,Mr. Hughes, was made to say that the arrangement whereby Japantook the islands north of the Equator was. fair and equitable, andwas the result of negotiations to which he had been a party. Thefacts were that the then Colonial Secretary had informed theCommonwealth that it was vitally important not to offend Japan ;that Japan was in possession of the islands anyhow, and that nothing we could say would affect their occupation. That was thereal position, and Australia simply accepted the inevitable.Mr. Bonar Law agreed, and. said that Mr. Hughes had&apos;acquiesced in that which was already done.Sir J. Cook added that he regarded it as a serious matter that japan should be brought to within striking distance of Australia.Mr. Balfour said he had no doubt that France and Italy would both object to the whole of the policy which was being discussed.France not only considered that she ought to retain all the territoryshe was occupying, but M. Cambon had, in fact, been suggesting tohim that he wanted an enclave of territory near the mouth of the congo from Portugal, for which we might pay Portugal by conces-sions in East Africa.Lord Milner suggested that this attitude on the part of Franceand Italy was all the more reason for our taking a more moderate line.Mr. Lloyd George said that the question ought certainly notto be discussed merely as one of our giving up East Africa, or what-ever the territory might be, but as a general question dealing with what all the Allies were prepared to give up.With regard to East Africa, General Smuts said he wished toput in a strong plea for Britain being the mandatory Power in this case. The British Empire was the great African Power right along the eastern half of the continent, and securing East Africa wouldgive us through communication along the whole length of thecontinent a matter of the greatest importance from the point ofview both of land and of air communications. In his opinion it wasnot only on the grounds of our conquests and sacrifices, but on the[530-24]&apos; C
1 t;obvious geographical situation, that we were entitled to makea strong claim to being the mandatory in that region. Personallyhe would give up very much in order to attain that. He was notputting in a claim to East Africa for the South African Union, butthe view he had expressed would be very strongly felt in the Union,which had taken the main share in the conquest of East Africa. Hewould prefer to see the United States in Palestine rather than EastAfrica,Mr. Balfour suggested that the line of argument pursued - byGeneral Smuts was perhaps playing a little fast-and-loose with thenotion of mandatory occupation.Mr. Long pointed out that, as regards East Africa, it wasnecessary to consider the interests, not only of the natives of german east Africa itself, but also of those in other British territories in africa, who had helped us in the War, and who would be profoundlydisturbed if that territory were handed over to any other Power.There was no guarantee that the United States would understandhow to govern African natives.Lord Curzon pointed out that we had accepted the principle ofself-determination, and could not therefore allot mandates to this or that Power without the consent of the populations affected. In thecase of Palestine, for instance, both the Jewish and the Arab elements in the population were quite definitely in favour of a British andnot of an American mandate. He thought we were a little apt inthis discussion to forget the best interests of the people themselves.If we were able to give a better Government than other Powershe did not think that we ought to step out of the scene simplyfor fear of being accused of territorial aggrandisement. after all, our greater territorial occupation during this war was the inevitable result of our previous position as a colonising Power, inconsequence of which we were already contiguous to the enemy inthose regions^Mr. Hughes pointed out that self-determination could, of course,only be one factor in a decision. In the case of such a territory as new Guinea a referendum would be a futile proceeding. TheUnited States themselves would never consent to. a transfer ofMexican territory to Germany or to Japan by referendum. Theprinciple would be a dangerous one if it were made an absolutelygoverning one.Mr. Lloyd George pointed out that this was really covered inPresident Wilsons article 5 by the words &quot; as far as possible.&quot;Summing up the discussion, Mr. Lloyd George said that he agreed with Lord Milner that the first step was to find out if theUnited States were prepared to take their share of responsibility ina mandatory capacity. As to the question where that mandateshould be exercised, he earnestly hoped that we should not let theUnited States into Europe, and, above all, into so dominant aposition as Constantinople, which had been suggested. He waseutirely in favour of their undertaking a mandate in Armenia, whichhe hoped we should not touch ourselves. As regards Palestine, hehad been in favour of entrusting that to the United States originally,but had changed his mind. It would involve placing an absolutelynew and crude Power in the middle of all our complicated interestsin Egypt, Arabia, and Mesopotamia. Everyone with any complaint to make against British administration would rush off to the UnitedStates, who would not be able to resist the temptation to meddle.Every Bedouin would be going to the Americans, and we should beput into the humiliating position of continually giving in to the americans on every complaint raised by them, up to a point when wecould stand it no longer, and then might find ourselves involved in aserious quarrel. It was from this point of view that he felt that, weshould have to consider the transfer of East Africa as the least un-desirable alternative. He considered Palestine and Mesopotamiaboth of equal importance, and had frankly told M. Clemenceau,
Baron Sonnino, and Signor Orlando that we intended to stay inPalestine and Mesopotamia, to which M. Clemenceau had answered,&quot; All right, I ddn&apos;t care.&quot;Lord Curzon said that he agreed with the Prime Minister aboutPalestine, after having also originally shared his views in favour ofentrusting the mandate to America. - The Eastern Committee were unanimous on the question, and so were the inhabitants of thecountry themselves. He drew attention to a resolution in favour ofBritish trusteeship, passed by a meeting of American Jews, whichwas reported in the previous day&apos;s &quot;Times.&quot; The AmirFeisal statedemphatically that, while he was prepared to throw in all his influencewdth the British in Palestine, even to the extent of helping the Jews,he would oppose any other Power with all his might. The principleof self-determination was still further emphasised in connection withPalestine by the Anglo-French declaration of November 1918, bywhich we had endeavoured to get out of the unfortunate Sykes-Picot agreement. On the other hand, there was Armenia, wherethe inhabitants themselves were asking for either French or Americanprotection.Mr. Montagu said it would be. very satisfactory if we could find some convincing argument for not annexing all the territories in the world.Lord Milner pointed out that Armenia was really essentially amore important country than any of the others under discussion.The mere fact that we did not want it ourselves was no reason for not assigning the responsibility of it to the United States.Mr. Chamberlain concurred in this view, and suggested that the essence of a good bargain was that both sides should be satisfied with the result, and that it was not right to assume that nothing would be of value to the Americans unless it involved an injury tous. As regards Palestine, he did not think we ought to ask for itand run the danger of sacrificing East Africa for it, because palestine would come to us inevitably by the desire of the inhabitants. Ifwe were to make a test question in approaching the United States,lie would select Armenia, in which the United States already had an interest, and not East Africa.Mr. Churchill said that if we had to give up some territory hewas strongly in favour of giving up German East Africa. we already had more territory in that part of the world than we hadeither the wealth or the capacity to develop. On the other hand, ifAmerica were introduced in the heart of European politics, inArmenia, or anywhere else in the Mediterranean region, this wouldbe an incentive to her to make herself the greatest Naval Power.An African colony used for purposes of investment would raise nostrategic question.Admiral Wemyss supported this argument, and said theAdmiralty would regard a large American fleet in the Mediterraneanwith greater apprehension than anywhere else. An Americanoccupation of Palestine, or Armenia, would inevitably lead to herbuilding up a fleet in the Mediterranean, with bases and lines ofcommunication.Mr. Balfpur said he did not see any reason why such policeduties as the United States might be called upon to fulfilin Palestine or Armenia would lead to her maintaining a great fleet.Sir Bobert Borden said that fP the chief result of this war wasa scramble for territory by the Allied nations, it would be merely a prelude to further wars.Lord Milner said that he wished to get America in in any case.He considered that the future peace of the world depended on agood understanding between us, and regarded this policy of a man-date by the League of Nations, not as a mere cloak for annexation,but as a bond of union leading to better working between the UnitedStates and ourselves. The essential thing was that we shouldsurvey the whole field from that point of view.
Sir Robert Borden said that he entirely agreed. Personally he-did not regard the presence of an American fleet in the Mediterraneanwith any apprehension.. Lord Milner and Mr. Chamberlain expressed their concurrence in this view.Sir S. Sinha said that, while India was not after any scramblefor territory, he wished to urge emphatically that, whether german east Africa were retained in our possession or assigned to us or anyother Power in a mandatory capacity, there should be an open doorin that country for Indians, and that they should not be subjected tothe disabilities and restrictions to which they were subjected in otherparts of the Empire. There had been over 300 years of contact between India and East Africa, and the Germans themselves hadadmitted the Indians as desirable immigrants. He wished theposition of Indians in East Africa to be made safe and clear, what-ever else happened.The Imperial War Cabinet instructed The Secretary to draft resolutions arising out of Ithe discussion,for consideration at the next Meeting of the Imperial WarCabinet, to be held on the afternoon of Monday, the 23rdDecember, 1918.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,December 20, 1918.
