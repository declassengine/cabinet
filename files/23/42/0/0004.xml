2The Western Front. 1. THE Director of Military Intelligence explained, with the aid of a map, the advance made in the Merville salient. He statedthat the average depth of the advance was 1J miles on a front of6 miles, and that we had captured between 600 and 700 prisoners.The Director of Military Intelligence considered the advance ofimportance, and stated, in answer to a question, that there was a chance of our recovering Bailleul. He did not think, however, thatwe had any big objective in view, as the Merville operations were more a tapping of the enemy&apos;s weak points than anything else.The Director of Military Intelligence stated that we had madea number of patrol advances in the neighbourhood of Arras. our patrols had found the Ficheux area unoccupied, and had reached thenorthern extremities of Neuville-Vitasse.On the French front, the Director of Military Intelligence statedthat the French had made an advance in the Lassigny area, and had reached the outskirts of the town. Between the Oise and the Aisnethe French had also made an advance on a front of 15 kilom.,and had captured 2,000 prisoners.The Caucasus. 2. The Director of Military Intelligence reported that it now appeared that General Bicharakoff had never gone to Baku, but was at Derbend, from where he had sent a message to General Dunster-ville to say that the Turks (presumably the Daghestani Tartars) had occupied Kizil Burun, about 80 miles North-West of Baku ; thatthe Bolsheviks were sending troops to Baku from Astrakhan ; thathe fiimself had been attacked by the Bolsheviks at Derbend, but haddefeated them, and, having been joined by half the originalBolshevik garrison of Derbend, he was now proposing to occupyPetrovsk and try and get reinforcements from the Northern Caucasusto help Baku.Food Situation at archangel,3. With reference to Imperial War Cabinet 31, Minute 5, theDirector of Military Intelligence stated that the food situation at archangel -was acute, and that if we were going to meet the require-ments of General Poole, it was necessary for us to do so within threeweeks, otherwise the ships would be unable to unload at Archangel,and get out before the ice formed. The Director of Military Intelli-gence said that only 15,000 tons of flour was being shipped, but thatGeneral Poole required 40,000 tons.It was decided that The War Office and the Minister of Shipping should go into thequestion, and make definite proposals for the considerationof the War Cabinet.Food Situation at murmansk.4. The Director of Military Intelligence stated that the food situation at Murmansk also gave rise to a certain amount of anxiety,but that the question was not so acute as that of Archangel, owingto the fact that Murmansk was an ice-free port.Submarines. 5. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that H.M.S. &quot;Stour&quot;reported having sunk a submarine three miles south of Souter Pointby means of depth charges..Fire at Howden Air 6. The Deputy First Sea Lord stated that a fire had occurred atStation. the Howden Air Station on the morning of the 16th instant, whichhad destroyed three of our airships. Only one casualty had beenreported. In answer to a question, Admiral Hope stated that, as faras the Admiralty had been able to discover, there were no signs of sabotage.
Air Activity. 7. The Chief of the Air Staff stated that he had recently been to France, and had made some enquiries with regard to the air fighting- which took place in the battle between 8th and 12thAugust. He said that the daily average for the four days&apos; fighting was 40 enemy machines destroyed, and 21 shot down out ofcontrol, making a total of 61. Our daily average loss had been 21machines. With regard to the first day, it had been stated thatthe 50 British machines which had been brought down in thefighting seemed a high percentage, but be had since discoveredthat five of these machines had landed on our side of the lines, andhe hoped that, when all reports had been received, this numberwould increase perhaps to ten. Another point with regard to theair fighting in the recent battle, was the number of our machinesbrought down by enemy fire from the ground. Out of a total of45 machines brought down on 8th August, about 75 per cent, ofthese had been brought down by fire from the ground. this further emphasised the views upon which we had already taken action, viz., that it was necessary to provide special armouredmachines to attack ground objectives. An experimental squadron of such armoured aeroplanes should be in action in France in thecourse of the next few weeks.Kaids on Enemy 8- T]ae Cilief of t^e Air ytag. rep0rted that we had carried outAerodromes. a -q^jj^qj. 0f raids on a large scale against enemy aerodromes, andhad inflicted very heavy damage. In one of these, in which an australian squadron had taken part, the Habourdin Aerodrome,near Lille, had been attacked and several of the sheds had been destroyed. A train and motor-cars on the roads had been success-fully attacked.Use of Parachutes 9 The Chief of the Air Staff stated that the Germans wereby Scout attaching parachutes to their scout aeroplanes, and that owingAeroplanes. this the    ilots of three German aeroplanes which had beenbrought down in flames had escaped. It was not known whetherthe occupants had landed safely. We were also making experimentswith parachutes, but so far they had not been very satisfactory.Archangel: 10. The Chief of the Air Staff stated that we had one seaplaneSeaplane and carrier   and  two   mixed   aeroplane   and seaplane squadrons atAeroplane Carriers.   Archangel.   A. certain amount of Russian materiel and personnelwas being collected and organised by us.said on the Black 1L The Chief of the Air gtaff reported that information hadores&apos; been received from the Independent Air Force to the effect that anattempt had been made to set on fire part of the Black Forest. Itwas rumoured that the attack had met with success.Mr. Massey said that he had been informed on the previous day at Newcastle that manv of the fires which had recently occurred a tour aerodromes were reported as due to sabotage.General Sykes stated, however, that the Intelligence Branchof the Air Force was working in close co-operation with the WarOffice, and enquiries had been going on for the last three months,but that, so far, they had been unable to discover any evidence of sabotage.
Employment of 12. The Imperial War Cabinet had before them a note by irish Labourers in Balfour, covering a memorandum  by the  French  ChargeFrance. d&apos;Affaires, in regard to recruiting Irish labourers for agricultural work in France (Paper G.T.-5432).It was stated in the memorandum that the French Mission sentto Ireland for the purpose of recruiting labourers for service inFrance had achieved, a real success. The mission had travelledthrough a part of Ireland, notably the counties of Donegal andGalway, and had entered into relations with the clergy and the peasants themselves. The reception given to the mission, whichwas often very reserved at first, had always ended by becomingmost sympathetic. The mission had received assurances that itwould be possible to recruit a considerable number of Irishlabourers to France, but it had been considered imprudent toaccept the very numerous offers that had been received. It was thought best to start by an experiment of sending 100 labourersfrom Donegal and Galway. These labourers would spend two orthree months in France, and would there be divided up in small groups in the most Catholic districts of France.Major Baird, on behalf of the Air Ministry, said he hoped thatthe recruitment of these Irish labourers would not affect the supplyof men to the Air Service, because Ireland, as a whole, was themost hopeful source of recruits for air mechanics. Between the20th July and the 10th August, the number of such recruits for theAir Service was 128.The viewr was expressed that, while the number of Irishagricultxiral labourers recruited for France was small, there couldbe no doubt that the French Government expected the experimentof 100 men to lead on to the recruitment of several thousands. IfIrish agricultural labourers were given the choice of either going into the British&quot; Army or into French agriculture, they would un-doubtedly choose agriculture, whereby they would escape militaryservice, and the whole scheme of military recruitment in ireland would be upset. There was, therefore, much to be said for stoppingat once and entirely the recruitment for agriculture in France.On the other hand, it was pointed out that M. Clemenceau had very warmly welcomed the idea, and it would be difficult now to notify him that the Irishmen were not to be sent.Sir James Campbell, speaking for the Irish Office, said that, inthe opinion of the Board of Agriculture for Ireland, it was extremelyimprobable that the Irish agricultural labourers would be obtained for France. The French Mission appeared to be building too muchupon the hopes and hospitality extended to them while in Ireland.No men had actually been engaged yet, and &quot; the very numerousoffers&quot; referred to in the Memorandum were merely offers from theclergy to help.In these circumstances the Imperial War Cabinet were of opinionthat No action in the matter was required.13. With reference to War Cabinet 455, Minute 17, and WarCabinet 460, Minute 10, the Imperial War Cabinet resumed theconsideration of Section 40Dof the Defence of the Realm Acts,adjourned from the 16th August, 1918.The Deputy Secretary of State for War stated that the regulationwas the result of discussions which had taken place last year at meetings of the Imperial War Conference, and of representations made by the Prime Ministers of the Dominions. The Army council had been inclined to oppose the Regulation because it tended to identify the Army as a segregation camp for venereal disease. Atthe request of the American Government the Regulation had beenDefence of the realm Acts:Section 40 D.
extended and made to apply to the American troops in this country.There was undoubtedly veiy determined opposition to the Regula-tion, mainly on the ground that it penalised women and not men.To that objection there were several answers. It was held not tobe possible to pass a Regulation under the Defence of the RealmActs which would be applicable to the whole of the civilian population. In the next place, the soldier was penalised because,if he hid the fact that he had contracted the disease, he was liableto be court-martialled and to be condemned to two years hardlabour. He was also liable to be sent to hospital for treatment which might last for many months, during which he would loseordinary pay, and also efficiency pay, and his wife would lose herseparation allowance. The opposition to the Regulation camemainly from Societies which had resisted the Criminal law amendment Bill last year. If Mr. Barnes&apos; suggestion to suspend the Regulation were adopted, it would have a prejudicial effect onthe adoption of Clause 5 of the Criminal Law Amendment Bill,which was an extension of Regulation 40 D. It should be borne in mind that the prevalence of the disease in the Army appeared tobe diminishing.Mr. Barnes said that such figures as were available showed that little, if any, diminution of the disease could be attributed to the regulation. On the other hand, it had considerable effect infomenting an agitation which was rapidly assuming very largeproportions. When it became generally known that a number of innocent women had been subjected to examination, and that somehad even gone to prison, and, after having been found innocent,had been dismissed, there would be a widespread and violent outcry.He fully recognised the weight which must be given to the representations of the Dominion Premiers, who had been impressed with the temptation which surrounded soldiers from overseas, but no figures were available, and he was inclined to think that theextent of the evil had been exaggerated. He urged that either the Regulation should be suspended, or that it should be madeequally applicable to both sexes.Lord Reading said he did not wish to offer any formal opinon as to whether the civilian population could or could not be embracedin a Regulation under the Defence of the Realm Acts, but it wouldbe difficult to pass and enforce a Regulation which the Law officers had already decided to be illegal. It would probably be urged thatthe Government were doing under the Defence of the Realm Act:what ought to be done under Statute. One of the women&apos;s societieswould be certain to take a test case to the Courts and appeal underhabeas corpus. From the political standpoint the proposal to extend the present powers by Regulation instead of by Statute, so as tobring every man under the Regulation, would, in his opinion,greatly increase the present agitation, and would have the result of enabling evil-disposed women to resort to blackmail a very real danger.Lord Robert Cecil said there was a great advantage in having a case which was logically defensible, and he did not think theGovernment would be able to maintain the Regulation in its present form, whereas it might be possible to maintain it if it were madeto apply to both sexes.Mr. Massey did not see why the disease was not made anotifiable one, and women kept off the streets by law, after, say,10 o&apos;clock. The present condition of things was a national disgrace,and should not be allowed to continue. Soldiers from overseas werebeing subjected to temptations to which they ought not to be subjected, and the Government was distinctly blamable in thematter.Mr. Munro said he had received many representations on thesubject from the women&apos;s organisations in Scotland.   The agitationWas mainly based on the one-sided character of the Regulation, and,[706-4] C
in order to remove that grievance, he would like to see the regulation extended equally to both sexes.Sir George Cave said that it would be a serious matter to drop the Regulation, and if that were done he would not be able to go on with clause 5 of the Criminal Law Amendment Bill. He did not wish to lay too much stress on the available figures, because thePolice were reluctant to bring the charge, and the Magistrates were reluctant to convict. Nevertheless, it remained true that there were some fifty women locked up for from three to six months, each of thema centre of infection. The Police returns from several areas didshow a very real decrease as a result of the enforcement of the regulation, and it was significant that Canada had adopted the regulation, with a useful amendment enabling the Court to choose the doctor. Something could no doubt be done to improve thepresent administration. There could be greater privacy, andGovernors of Prisons might be authorised to inform the Police ofcases of women discharged before being cured. He thought theviolence of the present agitation might possibly be abated by makingthe Regulation apply all round. The Regulation was undoubtedlydoing good, and it would be a pity to lose the benefit obtained from it. The suggestions put forward by Mr. Massey would require legislation. On the whole, he was inclined to recommend that,as agreed at the Committee of Home Affairs (Seventh Meeting,Minute 1), Mr. Macpherson should prepare a statement for propaganda purposes, and he (Sir George Cave) would circulate to the War Cabinet a memorandum on possible improvements in procedure. Further, the Solicitor-General might be asked to advise on the legal position.Major Skelfcon stated that, in the American Army, they hadfrequent and strict inspection of their men. For example, lastweek, out of 20,000 American soldiers in England there were 21cases reported. In his view licensing of houses had been a complete failure, and at the base ports in France such houses had been putout of bounds. It had been found impossible in practice in most countries to keep the administration of such houses free frombribery.Dr. Thompson said he did not think the disease could be stampedout by the examination of women, nor did he think that the presentregulation would appreciably diminish the venereal rate. He hadgreater faith in prophylactic measures. In the American Navycompulsory prophylaxis had been abolished, and there had been an increase of the disease in the Navy on that account. Whethera man was punished or not for concealing the disease was amatter left to the discretion of the individual commanding officer. The situation in American ports was not essentiallydifferent from that found in the ports of this country, of Australia,and of India.It was decided that (a.) The Deputy Secretary of State for War should circulate tothe Imperial War Cabinet a draft statement suitable forgeneral propaganda.(h.) The Secretary of State for Home Affairs should circulate a memorandum on possible improvements in theadministration of the regulation, and should consider what steps, if any, could be taken by the police toremove temptation from soldiers arriving at the chiefrailway stations in London.(c.) The Law Officers of the Crown should be asked to advise the Government on the question of extending Regula-tion 40 D to the civilian population generally.(At this point the Dominion repiesentatives withdrew.)
FinancialTreatment ofPersons of enemy origin Suspendedfrom Employmentin government offices.14. With reference to War Cabinet 444, Minute 7, the WarCabinet had before them a memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer in regard to the financial treatment of persons of enemy origin suspended from employment in Government offices (PaperIt was pointed out in this memorandum that the Treasury hadto issue instructions to Departments with regard to the treatmentof employes in Government Departments who would be suspendedfrom their employment during the war in consequence of the recent decision of the War Cabinet against the employment of persons inGovernment offices who were not the children, of natural-born subjects of this country or of an allied country. It was proposed to lay down the following rules : (a.) Persons who were taken into His Majesty&apos;s forces would receive the same treatment as other Governmentemployes who join the forces.(6.) Those persons not taken into His Majesty&apos;s forces, but who might be lawfully pensioned, should be pensioned forth-with, or so soon as (during the war) the statutoryconditions became fulfilled.(c.) Those persons who were not taken into His Majesty&apos;s forces .and might not lawfully be pensioned, in the case of civilservants with established rights, receive half theirordinary remuneration during the period of their suspension-sion, subject to certain conditions stated in thememorandum.The War Cabinet approved the proposals contained in the-Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s memorandum.(Initialled)A.
