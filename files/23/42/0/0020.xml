.2Belgian Troops andLuxemburg.Military and naval Positionin Eussia.1. Lord Robert Cecil drew the attention of the Imperial WarCabinet to a communication (Paper G.T.-6584) from the french ambassador, stating that the Belgian Government wished toparticipate in the occupation of Luxemburg, with three battalions,and adding that the French Government were in favour of grantingthe Belgian request.It was mentioned that Marshal Foch was opposed to suchparticipation, probably because he hoped to see Luxemburg annexed to France, but that was not the view taken by M. Clemenceau.The Imperial War Cabinet decided that The request of the Belgian Government should be acceded to.2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff enquired whether he was to proceed with demobilisation measures in the case ofthe troops at Murmansk and Archangel, and elsewhere in Russia.He was not anxious to do so, as that would involve finding othertroops, both technical and drafts, to take their place. To order outdrafts at this moment would not be a popular proceeding.Again, there were two British battalions at Omsk. these were to have been reinforced by three Canadian battalions, but theCanadian Government had decided that these were not to go beyond Vladivostock, and neither the Japanese, nor the americans were sending up any reinforcements. General Knox had suggestedthat it might be as well to send the Canadian battalions back to canada, and replace them by Indian battalions.Sir Robert Borden pointed out that his Government had refused, pending a definite decision on Allied policy in Russia.Sir S. Sinha urged that it was very undesirable to send indian troops to Siberia at this time of the year.Some discussion followed as to the general situation in Siberia.Lord Robert Cecil gave a brief resume of recent events in Siberia,more particularly in connection with the dispute between the americans and the Japanese over the administration of the railway.Both he and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff agreed tha,t the battalions at Omsk were in no immediate danger.Mr. Lloyd George expressed the view that the present position was highly unsatisfactory. We were neither, interfering effectively in Russia nor evacuating it. The essential thing was to arrive ata definite Allied policy, and he considered that this was the veryfirst thing to which the Allied statesmen should address themselveswhen they arrived in Paris.Admiral Fremantle informed the Imperial War Cabinet thatthe Admiralty had received a telegram on the previous night fromthe Admiral in command of the Sixth Light Cruiser Squadron, atRiga, to the effect that the Lettish troops in Riga had mutinied,and that H.M.S. t: Ceres &quot;had opened fire on the Bolshevik quarter,at the request of the Esthonian Government. The mutineers had subsequently surrendered, and British patrols were keeping orderin the town. The Admirals orders had been to land arms and give naval support, if required, but not to land men unlesscircumstances made it urgently imperative to do so. &apos; As a matterof fact, he had landed about 5,000 out of 20,000 rifles withhim, his policy being not to let any rifles go out of his hand unless hewas satisfied that the men could use them. He was, in fact, dailytraining men on the shore, alongside one of his ships, and collectingthe rifles again every evening. He was being besieged by requests for assistance, not only from the Esthonian Provisional Government,but from all sorts of other bodies. Admiral Fremantle wished toknow whether the Imperial War Cabinet wished to withdraw the sixth Light Cruiser Squadron, or to face intervention on a larger scale. There was a danger of our being drawn into operations fromwhich it would be difficult to disentangle ourselves. A decisions would have to be come to quickly, as the ships would have to leave
IWC 48Riga before the middle of January if they were not to be ice-boundthere. From the Admiralty point of view it was certainly desirableto get the ships away from the whole of that area, both because ofthe damage they would suffer from the ice, and because of the danger that the ice would obliterate the navigation marks through theminefields. In this connection he mentioned that the port of Libau,further South, was ice-free, and, as there was no Bolshevik troublethere, as at Riga and Reval, there was not the same danger ofentanglement if a ship stayed there. He wished to add, however,that it was probable that if we withdrew the ships from Riga thelocal Bolsheviks would massacre all their political opponents.It was pointed out that the troops which mutinied were actuallypart of the forces, of the Government of order, which we were sup-porting against the invading Bolsheviks, and that this showed thehopelessness of the task of attempting to prop up a local Governmentwhich rested on such weak foundations.It was generally agreed that on this particular question adecision could not be postponed till the general question of our policy in Russia was settled in Paris, and in view of the probability thatRiga would be frozen up before such a decision was reached :The Imperial War Cabinet decided that The Admiralty should instruct the Admiral in Command of the sixth Light Cruiser Squadron to withdraw his ships fromRiga and Reval, owing to the danger of their being shut inby the ice, but that one ship might be left at Libau readyto be withdrawn at short notice.The Imperial War Cabinet also decided that No demobilisation should take place in the case of the troops at archangel and Murmansk pending a decision upon allied policy in Russia^The Imperial War Cabinet further decided that The Foreign Office, the Admiralty, and the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff should each prepare a report from their pointof view, on the situation in Russia, with a view to theforthcoming discussions in Paris.3. Mr. Barnes expressed his agreement with the view previouslyput forward by Sir Robert Borden, that we could not leave thePeace Conference with Russia still a scene of warfare. It was equallyclear that we could not fight Bolshevism in Russia except on a large scale. It was no use merely poking with sticks into the kennel toinfuriate the dog. He would be in favour of getting all sections ofRussians, including the Bolsheviks, to meet, at the instance of thePeace Conference, with a view to adjusting their own differences.If this failed, then intervention might be justified, though he con-sidered that it should be limited to economic pressure. He did notconsider that we could suppress Bolshevism forcibly without Americanhelp. ,Mr. Churchill expressed the conviction that the more the Alliesattempted to get away from this problem the more it would stick tothem. He was in favour of joint action by the five Great Powers, or,if America refused to act, by the rest. The intervention should becollective, and not by one Power only, and with joint contingents.He was all for negotiation, with the object of securing a satisfactory settlement without fighting. But he considered that there was no chance of securing such a settlement unless it was known that wehad the power and the will to enforce our views. What we should say to the Russians was that if they were ready to come together wewould help them : and that if they refused, we would use force to
restore the situation and set up a democratic Government. In his view,Bolshevism in Russia represented a mere fraction of the population,and would be exposed and swept away by a General Election held under Allied auspices. A decision on this question was urgent. Itwas the only part of the war which was still going on, and if weignored it we should come away from the Peace Conference rejoicingin a victory which was no victory, and a peace which was no peace :and in a few months we should find ourselves compelled to gatherour armies again, and summon the-Conference anew in order to dealwith the situation.Mr. Lloyd George agreed that the question was one upon whichwe should come to a decision before anything else. Even a fewweeks&apos; delay might easily drift us into disaster. He felt that wehad never yet arrived at any satisfactory decision. He himself had found himself frequently leaning first in one direction, and then in another, owing to the absolute contradiction between the informa-tion supplied from Russia by men of equally good authority. Wewere, in fact, never dealing with ascertained, or, perhaps, evenascertainable, facts. Russia was a jungle in which no one could say what was within a few yards of him. In any case nothing could be worse than having no policy, and it was better to proceedresolutely on a wrong hypothesis than to go on hesitating asthe Allies had been doing. He wished to lay before the imperial war Cabinet the views which he.was in favour of putting forward to President Wilson and M. Clemenceau in Paris, if his colleaguesconcurred.He was definitely opposed to military intervention in any shape.In the first place, it appeared to him a tremendously serious under-taking. The Germans, who had occupied only a relatively small part of Russia, within striking distance of Petrograd and withpractically nothing in front of them, had found themselves unable,either to go to Petrograd or to save the situation in the west, while-all the time they and the Austrians had something like a million men stuck in that morass, the greater part of whom they had not even yet succeeded in disentangling. In our case the Allies were on-the mere Iringe of Russia, with less than 100,000 troops. TheBolsheviks had raised their forces to 300,000, which might exceed,000,000 by March, and had greatly improved their organisation.Where were we to find the troops with which to march into the heart of Russia and occupy the country ? We already had to findtroops for Germany, Palestine, Mesopotamia, and the Caucasus. he asked what contribution Australia, Canada, or South Africa wereprepared to furnish to the task of conquering and keeping downRussia ? No British troops could be found for the purpose withoutconscription, and if Parliament endorsed conscription for thatpurpose he doubted whether the troops would go. Our citizen armyware prepared to go anywhere for liberty, but they could not be convinced that the suppression of Bolshevism was a war for liberty..A further reason which weighed with him was the danger that military intervention would only strengthen the very force which we-set out to destroy. It was impossible to ignore the parallel of theFrench Revolution. There, too, there had been horrors as bad as, orworse than, those of the Bolsheviks, perpetrated by a small fraction,which had secured the control of France. There, too, we were invited to help. Toulon and La Vendee corresponded to Riga andthe Ukraine. But the very fact that we intervened enabled Danton.to rally French patriotism and make the terror a military instru-ment. When the Revolution was suppresed we were no better off.France became organised as a great military machine imbued,with a passionate hatred against us. Were we prepared to face a revolutionary war against a population of over 100,000,000,. associating ourselves in this intervention with allies like the Japanese,,against whom feeling in Russia was so passionately strong. he knew of no authority on the strength of which we could be justified.
in hypothecating our r-esources and our manhood in the belief thatthe Russians would regard us as deliverers. For Russia to emanci-pate herself from Bolshevism would be a redemption, but the attempt to emancipate her by foreign armies might prove a disasterto Europe as well as to Russia. The one thing to spread Bolshevismwas to attempt to suppress it. To send our soldiers to shoot down the Bolsheviks would be to create Bolsheviks here. The best thingwas to let Bolshevism fail of itself and act1 as a deterrent to theworld, just as the failure of similar movements in 1848 had had a salutary effect in Europe.On the other hand, he considered that the application ofeconomic pressure was another matter. This was something thatthe Bolsheviks were beginning to realise themselves, and he con-sidered that M. LitvinofFs presence at Stockholm was largely due tothe fact that the Russians were starving.In conclusion, he hoped that the Cabinet would agree to supporthim in refusing to countenance any military intervention, and ininviting the representatives of all sections of Russia to appear beforethe Peace Conference, as Sir Robert Burden had suggested, with aview to their composing their differences.Lord Robert Cecil, while generally agreeing with Mr. LloydGeorge that any invasion of Russia would be fantastic, said therewere difficulties arising out of our existing obligations to the Czechsand other parties, whom we had been helping and whom we couldnot suddenly leave in the lurch. He presumed that assistance inthe shape of money and equipment would still be furnished to them.It was also necessay to take into account the possibility that theBolsheviks were organising these great forces with a definitelyaggressive purpose, largely for economic reasons. Colonel Boyle, a canadian officer who has just returned from Russia, was of theopinion that the Bolsheviks were determined, as a next step, to invade Roumania and other, adjoining countries, such as Poland.The Imperial War Cabinet would have to face the possibility of suchan aggression, and would have to take measures to assist thesecountries in defending themselves.Lord Curzon pointed out, as an additional argument againstmilitary intervention, that neither France, nor America, nor Japan,meant to furnish soldiers for the purpose, and that the whole burden would have to fall upon ourselves.It was generally agreed that, in cases where there was anexternal aggression by the Bolsheviks against an existing Governmentwith which we had been co-operating, we should be entitled tosupport that Government in any manner which did not involvemilitary intervention, and that our general policy should be that, as sir J. Cook expressed it, of &quot; walling off a fire in a mine.&quot;Subject to the.above considerations, the Imperial War cabinet endorsed the general policy with regard to Russia outlined by Mr. Lloyd George.4. Resuming the discussion on the Prime Ministers report ofhis interviews with President Wilson (Imperial War Cabinet 47,Minute 1), Mr. Barnes expressed his dissent from the ratherdespondent tone taken by Mr. Hughes. Considering that PresidentWilson&apos;s statements were not final, and that his mind would still be influenced by future discussions, he considered those statements as not unsatisfactory. The President had been against the handingback, of the German colonies to Germany. He had agreed, or atany rate had shown an open mind, with regard to the incorporation of German South-West Africa in the South African Union ; evenas regards the Pacific Islands, he was prepared to have Australia asa mandatory; as regards the Freedom of the Seas, his views didnot   really  seem now  to clash with the view we had  put toC   .President Wilson&apos;visit;Statement by thePrime Minister.[753]
M. Clemehceau; namely, that our navy must be able to do in a future war what it bad done in the present one. The leastsatisfactory thing, to his mind, was that. the President showed noinclination to become responsible for any of the backward areas ofthe world! As regards the Jugo-Slavs, President Wilson&apos;s viewscoincided with our desires and our sense of what was right, if notwith our pledged word. He regretted that the. President seemeddisposed to side with the Jingoistic claims put forward by theFrench to the Saar Valley. There certainly was a Jingo spirit inFrance which we ought to keep in check. In his latest speech,M. clemenceau had openly avowed a policy of balance of power against the wider policy advocated by President Wilson. he regretted to hear Mr. Hughes&apos;s comparison between the UnitedStates arid France. Americans abandonment of her past attitude ofnon-intervention was a great fact in the w orld&apos;s history of whichwe should make the most. If there was a question of having to! support France or America at the Conference, he was entirely in favour of supporting America for all we were worth.As regards the League of Nations, he disagreed with the Frenchsuggestion that it should be discussed last at the Peace Conference.He considered that it should be discussed first, and its main principles agreed upon before they went on to other discussions,such as those on mandatory occupation, which would be entirely inthe air if no&apos; general decision on the League of Nations had been arrived at. After the general decision, the details could, of course,be left to a Commission. He wishedto suggest, with regard to thevenue of the League&apos; of Nations, that the Hague Palace of Peace,with its existing equipment and accumulated&apos; documentary material,should be utilised. Important International Conventions had alreadybeen agreed to there, even if they had not been put into effect.Mr. Lloyd George  said   he   agreed  with  Mr.  Barnes thatMr. Hughes had taken a somewhat too pessimistic view of PresidentWTilson&apos;s attitude.   He could only speak of impressions, but theimpression he had derived from the discussions was that there wasonlv one point where they were up against a really hard resistancefrom President Wilson and could get no nearer to an agreement ;that   was   the   question  of   indemnity.     On   the  question   of freedom of the Seas it seemed1 as if the President had been influenced by his discussion with M. Clemenceau.   On the Leagueof Nations he had been by no means extreme, and even on thedifference between mandatory occupation and annexation of the pacific Islands, though he was evidently prepared to put up a fight,he did not regard his attitude as irreconcilable.   Consequently hewas not pessimistic about inducing President Wilson to agreeultimately, though possibly under protest, to the things to whichwe attached importance, providing he could secure his League ofNations, which, politically, was a matter of life and death to him.On the other hand, he entirely agreed with Mr. Hughes that ifPresident Wilson should, in the last resort, prove obstinate, then the sacrifices of France and Great Britain were such that they were entitled to have a final say, and would say it.   But they would not do that till every       r.i at agreement had first been made andexhausted.   They wuictl (-gin by assuming that, in the main, theywere in agreement.   The President had evidently been affected byhis reception in this country, which was even warmer than hisreception in France, and the fact that the majority in the UnitedStates were more pro-British than he. was would also carry weight.Consequently, as long as he could go home saying that he had.secured the League of Nations, for which be had fought, and hadnot had any too direct rebuffs on other questions, it would be allright.     In any case, the British representatives were not goingto leave the Peace Conference without securing the things whichmattered most to us, though he was inclined to doubt whetherGermany could actually pay all the indemnity we had a right to demand.
Representation 5. The Imperial War Cabinet had before them a telegram fromat the Peace Lord Derby, dated December 15, 1918  (Paper G.T. 6068), in conference. regard to representation at the Peace Conference.   In this telegramit was suggested that the Allied Great Powers should be invited toappoint five plenipotentiaries each ; the smaller Allied Powers threeeach ; the new States recognised as Allies, two each ; States in thecourse of formation, one each; neutral States, one each. Theprinciple on which summonses would be issued might be thefollowing : Representatives of Allied Great Powers at all sittingsand committees; smaller Allied Powers and new Allied States tohave the right to be represented at all sittings at which questions concerning them were to be discusssed ; possible representation of states in course of idrmation and Neutral States to attend whensummoned by the Great Powers at sittings devoted to discussion oftheir interests and desiderata. It was suggested that the Congressshould be composed of two phases -(l) The settlement, properly speaking, of the War.(2) The eventual organisation of a Society of Nations.Lord Robert Cecil said that it was proposed in reply to telegrapha general acceptance of the French proposals in the following sense : &quot; Prime Minister has now considered matter. We agreewith French proposals on the understanding that they relatemerely to issue of invitation to Allied and Friendly Powers,and that number of representatives of smaller Powers to attendsittings of Conference will form subject of subsequent agreementbetween Great Powers. We assume, of course, that arrange-ments come to in recent Inter-Allied conversations in london with regard to representation of British Dominions hold good.We think question of division of Conference into two phasesshould await further discussion.&quot;Mr. Hughes said that, under the French proposals, the dominions would not be accorded representation equivalent to, say, Sweden,He called particular attention to the second of the two phasesproposed, which referred to the eventual organisation of the Leagueof Nations. If the League of Nations were to endure, it would be one of those questions at the Conference which would most vitallyconcern the Dominions. It was probable that in 25 years the whitepopulation of the British Empire overseas would exceed the popula-tion of Great Britain. He therefore suggested that, when theConference discussed this question, the Dominions were entitled torepresentation equal to that accorded to neutrals. Australiahad put and kept more men in the field than Belgium, anddeserved as much representation at the Conference. &apos;In reply &apos;to this, the Prime Minister pointed out that at ameeting on December 2, 1918, at which M. Clemenceau and SignorOrlando were present (Paper I.C.--.98 A), it had been agreed by therepresentatives of the British, French, and Italian Governments &quot; That there should be five delegates at the Inter-allied conference of each of the great. Allied and Associated Powers,namely : &quot; France,&quot; Great Britain,&quot; Italy,&quot;Japan,&quot; United States of America.[753J I)As to the League of Nations, he with Lord Robert Ceciland Mr. Barnes, that it was desirable to establish and lay downthree or four general principles with regard to it at the verybeginning, and then refer the matter to a committee to work out.
Representatives of the British Dominions and India should attend as additional members of the British delegation whenquestions directly affecting them are under consideration.&quot;The Prime Minister pointed out that the Dominions and india would be in the same position as, if not better than, the smallerAllied Powers, because it had been agreed at the same meeting &quot; That the smaller Allied Powers should have1 no right of representation at all the meetings of the Inter-Allied Conference,but that any of the smaller Allied Powers should have the. rightto be represented whenever questions concerning them werebeing discussed.&quot;The Prime Minister&apos;added that in all discussions on the subject,it had been intended to include in the five delegates representingGreat Britain, one representative of the Dominions and India.Sir  Robert   Borden   strongly   urged  that   the  question   of representation had a very serious aspect for the  Dominions, anda peculiar significance for Canada, which had no special materialinterest in the war, and  no claims to additional territory.   Itwould   be   regarded   as   intolerable   in   Canada   that   Portugalshould have a representation in the Peace Conference  which wasdenied to that Dominion.     Canada  had lost more men killed inFrance  than  Portugal  had put  into the  field.   If the french proposals were adopted as put forward in Lord Derbj&apos;&apos;s telegram,the result upon public opinion in  Canada would be such as he did not care to suggest, or even contemplate.     The status ofthe Dominions was not well understood by foreign Powers, andit would  be  not  only  proper,   but   necessary, for  the   BritishGovernment   to   set   it   forth   fully.     The British Empire hadthe   right   to   define   the   powers and functions of the nations which compose it, and foreign Powers had no right to question that definition.     He alluded to the unanimous resolution passed in the Imperial War Conference in 1917, which was accepted bythe British Government, and which declared that the constitutionof the Empire was based on the  principle   of equal  nationhoodand adequate voice in foreign relations.     Each Dominion shouldhave as ample a representation as Belgium or Portugal.    Therewas no question on which the people of Canada were more insistent-than their claim to representation at the Peace Conference which would settle the issues of a war in which they had taken so notable a part.He hojsed that the Cabinet would appreciate, although it was almost impossible for them fully to appreciate, the strong feeling in Canadaon this subject.     To provide that Canada should  be called   in only when&apos;her special interests were in question would be regardedas little better than a mockery.    It would be most unfortunate fromthe point of view of the Dominions that the British delegation shouldbe selected entirely from the British Isles.   That delegation had authority to represent not only the British Isles, but the whole empire.      He,   therefore,   strongly  urged   that   the   delegationrepresenting the British Empire should be in part selected froma panel, upon which each Prime Minister from the Dominions shouldhave a place^ and that one or more of those Prime Ministers shouldhe called from time to time, as occasion might require, to sit in the delegation representing the whole Empire at the Conference.Lord Robert Cecil agreed with Sir Robert Borden as to the wisdom of creating such a panel, and suggested that its members might serve on a kind of rota.The Prime Minister, who also approved of the idea of the panel,said that the real business of the Peace Conference would be trans-acted not at the formal conferences, but at the small informal conversations. The Dominions and India would have the samerepresentation as Serbia, Belgium, and Boumania. He considered,however, that it would be unwise to press for such a full representa-tion of the British Empire, at the first big conference and its final
The Victuallingand Supply of enemy, Allied, and neutral Countries.(ft.)(d.)6. With reference to Imperial War Cabinet 42, Minute 2,Lord Reading asked the Imperial War Cabinet to authorise theappointment of two British representatives to serve on an Inter-national Council to deal with questions of the distribution offood and enemy shipping. He said that President Wilson had proposed that these questions should be referred to the supreme war Council, with Mr. Hoover as Director-General in chargeof the general policy. To this proposal, however, the british representatives had objected. They had instead agreed, togetherwith representives of the other Allies, to the formation of anInternational Council which should determine the general policy, withMr. Hoover as adviser. It only remained to appoint the two british representatives to serve on the Council.Lord Robert Cecil suggested that, instead of creating this new machinery, it would be better to develop the existing allied maritime Transport Council into an International Economic Council,as had in fact been decided by the Government (War Cabinet 501,Minute 7). On the Transport Council were such men asM. Loucheur, M. Clementel and Signor Crespi, and he had alwayshoped that American representatives of weight, such as Mr. Hurleyand Mr. Hoover, might be added to it. Under the Council wasthe Food Council, and the whole organisation appeared to him tobe admirably equipped to deal with the problems of re-victuallingAllied, Neutral, and Enemy countries.Lord Reading replied that the Allied organisations referred toby Lord Robert Cecil would continue as at present, but new machinery had to be set up to deal with enemy and devastatedcountries, and also to meet the difficulties created by Mr. Hoover.He hoped that a Minister, and not himself, would be appointed bythe Cabinet as one of the British representatives on the proposed international body.The Imperial War Cabinet decided that Lord Reading and Sir Joseph Maclay, the British represen-tatives on the Allied Maritime Transport Council, shouldbe appointed to serve on the new International bodyreferred to by Lord Reading.2)Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,December 31, 1918.omeeting, as five delegates from Great Britain and three each fromthe Dominions and India, because in that event there would be nofewer than twenty-three representatives of the British Empire at such meetings : and in attempting to get so full a representation we might run the risk of losing more than we gained.The Imperial War Cabinet decided that-(a.) Representatives of the British Dominions and India oughtto be present at the opening session and at any othersession of the Peace Conference or the Allied preliminary conference (should it be held) at which Belgium andother smaller Allied States were represented.The British Dominions and India, should in all respectshave the same powers as, and be on an equal footing atthe Conference with, Belgium and other smaller AlliedStates.Lord Robert Cecil should re-cast the telegram to Paris onthese principles.The Prime Ministers of the Dominions and the representa-tives of India should be placed on a panel from whichpart of the personnel of the British delegation could be filled, according to the subject for discussion.
