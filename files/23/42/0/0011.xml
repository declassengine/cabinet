2Conclusions ofAllied Conversa-tions on Mondav,December 2, 1918.1. WITH reference to Papers Nos. I.C.-98 (a) and I.C.-99 (a),the Prime Minister said that the conclusions of the Allied conversa-tion which had been held on the 2nd December included, amongst other things, those of the payment by Germany of reparation andindemnity, the attitude of the Allies towards the ex-Kaiser, and the representation of the Allied Powers at the Peace Conference. Hehad asked the Secretary to the Imperial War Cabinet to circulate the conclusions arrived at during the Allied conversation, as he wouldlike to have the views and suggestions of the Imperial WarCabinet before the representatives of France and Italy joined theImperial War Cabinet meeting, which they were going to do at11-15 a.m.-Mr. Chamberlain called attention to the use of the word&quot; extradition &quot; at the bottom of p. 1 of Paper No. I.C.-98 (a), where he thought the proper word would be &quot;surrender,&quot; as used in thedraft telegram to President Wilson.The Prime Minister said that &quot; surrender &quot; was the right word,since the ex-Kaiser could not, hethought, be extradited, and in thisview Lord Curzon agreed. The Prime Minister undertook to propose this alteration to our Allies.Mr. Barnes asked if it were possible to communicate with president Wilson before he left the United States.The Prime Minister said that it had been agreed to send atelegram to President Wilson and that a copy of this telegram was attached to Paper No. I.C. 98 (a). He further said that there hadbeen a certain amount of discussion at the Allied conversation heldon the 2nd instant as to whether the ex-Kaiser should be treatedsummarily, as was done in the case of Napoleon, or whether a Statetrial should be held. M. Clemenceau was strongly in favour of aState trial, as he considered it would be very much more impressive.Sir Robert Borden was not prepared to agree without furtherconsideration that a State trial would afford the best method ofdealing with the ex-Kaiser. A trial before such a tribunal might become impressive in more senses than one if it were dragged out formany months or even for years, with the attendant opportunity for ;the ex-Kaiser to exercise his well-known art of posing and intriguing.In his opinion the public opinion of the world and the justice of thecase would be better satisfied if the ex-Kaiser were dealt with by resolution of the Peace Conference. The proposal was to create an ad hoc tribunal to try the ex-Kaiser for an ad hoc crime and byad hoc procedure. The tribunal was to be constituted not by theLeague of Nations but by the Allied belligerent nations. A sentenceby a tribunal created by the Allied nations with whom the ex-Kaiserhad been at war would not rank higher in point of fairness or justicethan a sentence by the Peace Conference upon facts which were known and admitted.The Prime Minister suggested that perhaps Sir robert borden would like to raise the question when the representativesof France and Italy joined the Imperial War Cabinet meeting at11-15 a.m. .Mr. Chamberlain hoped very much that Sir Robert Bordenwould do this, as he thought that a good many people held theview that a. State trial would give the ex-Kaiser&apos;s friends too muchopportunity for exalting him.Lord Reading asked if the view held at the Allied conversationwas definitely in favour of a State trial; and the Prime Minister repliedthat there was no question about it, and that if we wished to propose any other course we must ask our Allies if they would agree.A discussion of some considerable length then ensued as regardswhat method should be adopted for dealing with the ex-Kaiser, and during this discussion the following were some of the more important points raised.Lord Reading thought that, if a Court were to be established,there would be considerable advantage in calling it an International
Court instead of calling it a Judicial Court; and the Prime minister pointed out that the Lord Chief Justice had on the previous dayraised this very point, and suggested the term &quot;International Court,&quot;which had consequently been used in the first paragraph of the telegram to President Wilson.Sir Robert Borden suggested that, as the Court was to consistof nominees of the principal nations victorious in the war, in the broad sense it would not be an &quot; International Court &quot; unless neutralnations were added, and in any case it could not have any morejurisdiction than the Peace Conference.Lord Curzon asked if the action proposed in Paper No. I.C.-98(a) did not mean that action should be taken at once instead of waiting for the Peace Conference.Sir Robert Borden said that the Peace Conference would know the facts just as well as any International Tribunal, and he stillthought that the matter could best be dealt with by this conference.Mr. Hughes suggested that one difficulty in dealing with theex-Kaiser by a resolution of the Peace Conference would be that hewould not have any chance of defending himself, and to thisSir Robert Borden replied that his defence in any case would be purely formal. Mr. Hughes did not like the idea of an international court, in case one did not get a conviction. Such a result would,in his opinion, be dreadful. He would not take the risk of bringing the ex-Kaiser before an International Tribunal it was in theinterest of mankind that he should die. He also thought that itwould be difficult to say exactly what international law meant, asit was, at the present time, in a state of flux.The Prime Minister and Mr. Barnes both agreed that it was notpossible to have a clearer case of the violation of international lawthan that of the invasion of Belgium.Mr. Balfour pointed out that M. Clemenceau said he had considerable experience in these matters. Mr. Balfour&apos;s opinion was that it would not be possible to decide on any Court whichwould mould into the laws of each of the Allied Powers. It wouldbe necessary to invent a law to deal with this case.The Prime Minister said that M. Clemenceau had quoted theprocedure of the French Senate, which in political trials sits as aHigh Court of Justice and makes its own procedure and even itsown sentence. He said that in his opinion, if ever there was a clear case of the violation of international law, the invasion ofBelgium was one. The refusal of. the ex-Kaiser to join in aconference of the Great Powers to discuss the matters at issue andtry thereby to avoid war was another of the many charges whichmight be brought against him. The case which could be made against the ex-Kaiser was one such as the world had never known,and the charges could only be brought out properly before an Inter-national Tribunal. He (the Prime Minister) could imagine nothing more impressive than such a tribunal. Even if it did have to sit for months, this would only be a very small matter compared with thefact that it was going to initiate the principle that the rulers of thefuture would be held personally responsible for their acts ifthrough any fault of theirs blood and treasure were wasted bynations going to war. It was a tremendous innovation that we were proposing, and in this connection it was perhaps not always clearly understood that, although Napoleon was in the first instance sent toElba and eventually to St. Helena, it never entered into the headsof our ancestors that he should be treated as a criminal.- In thepresent case it was our intention to treat the ex-Kaiser as such. Itwould, in the opinion of the Prime Minister, be undignified to get aperson such as the ex-Kaiser or the ex-Crown Prince out of the wayby means of a resolution of the Peace Conference. He (Mr. Lloyd.George) entirely agreed with M. Clemenceau that the ex-Kaisershould be brought before an International Tribunal, and if it turned[530-19] B 2
out that such a Tribunal had to sit for a few months, such a fact was, in his opinion, insignificant compared with the great principlethat was at stake.Mr. Churchill, whilst still seeing some difficulties in the way ofan International Tribunal, said that he was now inclined to agreewith the Prime Minister that such a Tribunal would be the best method of dealing with the case.Mr. Hughes pointed out that by resorting to an international tribunal, we would be calling for evidence on facts which were wellknown to the whole world.Mr. Lloyd, while agreeing with most of what the PrimeMinister had said, doubted if the International Tribunal, althoughfinding the ex-Kaiser guilty of breaches of international law, would pass sentence on him in the present absence of sanctions from inter-national law, and the ex-Kaiser might escape punishment in spite ofhis guilt. i ;Mr. Balfour suggested that the ex-Kaiser was responsiblefor crimes against; humanity rather than against internationallaw.Lord Reading asked if it; were not on account of this very doubtthat the Attorney -General had suggested that the ex-Kaiser shouldbe tried, for his responsibility for the invasion of Belgium and forapproving of -submarine warfare, as well as for his responsibility forthe war as a whole.Lord Curzon thought that the Prime Ministers arguments infavour, of a trial were very powerful, in fact, overwhelming. Hewould like to ask if it. were intended that the same Court should trythe ex-Kaiser,and also the ex-Crown Prince.The Prime. Minister replied in the affirmative..Lord Curzon then asked what action was to be taken as regards other responsible German officials, who ought to be tried.The Prime Minister thought that it would be better to settle the case of the ex-Kaiser first. Probably his trial would result in atrial of his principal accomplices, and words to this effect had been included in the telegram to President Wilson. M. Clemenceauthought, however, that a court-martial would be a good enoughmethod of trying the offenders of lower status.Mr. Long wanted to know if it were quite decided to try theex-Crown Prince, as he thought the case against the ex-Kaiser mightbe weakened thereby. Mr. Long strongly supported the view takenby the Prime Minister.The Prime Minister said the case against the ex-Crown Princewas that he had a very considerable amount to do with the warparty in Germany, and had used his influence to bring about a war.General Smuts was of opinion that some definite proceduremust be fixed as regards the trial of the ex-Kaiser and his subordinates, and asked if it were not possible when the Allies met and considered the question that they might not come to thesame conclusion as Sir Robert Borden.Sir Robert Borden observed that we should carefully considerthe points to which the present proposal would lead. If the PeaceConference, instead of exercising jurisdiction upon admitted andacknowledged facts, should propose to establish an international tribunal before which the ex-Kaiser should be impeached, some definite and permanent principle should be asserted and embodied in the proposed action. The principle to be asserted should be setforth in terms as precise and definite as the subject would permit,and should be so expressed as to include all persons responsible forforcing upon the world an unjust and aggressive war. The tribunal should be established or provided for upon a permanent basis, sothat all rulers and advisers of rulers in the future might know the penalty for any such action as that undertaken by the Germanautocracy in 1914. If such a principle were formulated and such a tribunal established, then both the principle and the Tribunal could
be declared to apply to the events which forced this war upon theworld.   He desired to observe that, whether the ex-Kaiser was tobe sentenced by the Peace Conference or to be tried before theproposed Tribunal, bis surrender should be asked for without delay.The Prime Minister agreed in this view.Lord Reading asked if we could do more now than to saywe wanted the ex-Kaiser brought to justice.The Prime Minister said he had met no one who did not agree on that point, but the question was whether he should bs dealtwith summarily or by trial.Mr. Lloyd said that even if the ex-Kaiser was brought before an International Tribunal, it might be necessary later to refer the -matter to the Peace Conference in order that he might be adequately punished, following the analogy of an Act of Attainderrather than that of impeachment.The Prime Minister said there would be no difficulty in doing this.The Prime Minister asked if anyone wished to raise anyother points.2. Mr. Hughes said that with reference to Paper No. I.C.-98(a), he saw that it was proposed to establish an Inter-Allied Corn-mission to report on the question of payment by the enemy of reparation and indemnity. He noticed in the terms of reference tothe Inter-Allied Commission it was only proposed to refer to repara-tion, and he would like to ask the difference between reparationand indemnity. He also noticed that each of the AlliedGovernments was to send three delegates to the Inter-allied commission.The Prime Minister pointed out that in Paper No. I.C.-98(a),although reparation was only referred to in the terms, both reparationand indemnity were referred to in the marginal note. He undertook to propose to our Allies the addition of the words &quot; and indemnities &quot;in the text of the resolution. As regards the three delegates to besent by Great Britain to the Inter-Allied Commission, the PrimeMinister asked Mr. Hughes to get his Committee to suggest threenames. The Prime Minister said that it was not enough to decide how much Germany could pay, but it was also necessary to say howshe could pay.Lord Curzon pointed out that according to Paper No. I.C.-98 (a)this was specially provided for in the proposed terms of reference tothe Inter-Allied Commission.The Prime Minister said that it also ought to be considered by our own Committee.Mr. Hughes pointed out that this was one of the points which hadbeen considered by his Committee. His Committee had prepared areport in the rough, and he hoped to be able to give the PrimeMinister a copy of it at a very early moment. It was difficult to dealfully with the question as to the capacity of Germany to pay. . Thepeople who knew Germany and its internal conditions best were those whose evidence could not safely be taken because their interests and outlook leaned to the German side.It was agreed that Mr. Hughes&apos; Committee should recommend three members toact as the British delegates on the Inter-Allied Commission.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,December 3, 1918.o
