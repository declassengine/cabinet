2The Western 1. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that thereFront, was no further information from the Western front beyond thatcontained in the morning&apos;s telegrams. He had, however, received a rather interesting letter from General Currie, in which GeneralCurrie stated that during the recent attack one of the battalionsunder his command alone captured thirty-eight machine-guns.Thirty-three German guns had been used by the Canadians againstthe Germans. General Currie said that the number of German deadwhich had been seen was extraordinary, and quite a number of these had been bayoneted. General Currie added that he thought thatthe success of his troops was greatly due to the two months&apos;&quot;training they had had previously.In reply to a question as to whether the battle would be con-tinued, General Wilson stated that it all depended upon what happened to-day and to-morrow. If any weak spots could bediscovered in the German line, he said they would most certainly be attacked.Submarines.2. The First Sea Lord stated that a successful attack had beencarried out against a submarine on the 13th instant, 3 miles north ofWhitby. Although no actual wreckage had come to the surface, yet the sweepers reported that there was little doubt that the submarine had been destroyed.Italian Cruiserwrecked.3. The First Sea Lord stated that the British Consul at Livornohsd reported that a lighter of ammunition for one of His Majesty&apos;s ships exploded in that port on the afternoon of the 13th August,with the result that the Italian cruiser &quot; Etruria &quot; was wrecked. Itwas feared that about twenty Italians were lost. There were no british casualties.Bombing Raids,4. The First Sea Lord reported bombing raids over Middelkerkeand Varssenaere aerodromes. At the latter place six machines linedup on the aerodrone were set on fire, and fires started in the hangars.Hits were obtained on two Gotha hangars, one of which wasdemolished. Large petrol dumps in a wood near the aerodromewere also set on fire. The fires were observed still burning threehours after the attack. One enemy aircraft was destroyed and onedriven down out of control.   All our machines returned safely.The shipping situation :Tonnage forArchangel.5. The Imperial War Cabinet had before them a note from theGeneral Staff, War Office (Paper G.T.-5397), containing a request that the British Government should earmark three ships to be usedfor carrying flour to Archangel. The-Prime Minister said that theshipping position at the moment was most critical. We were shorton imports by about 250,000 tons, owing to the amount of shippingAve had used for bringing over American troops. The americans were under the impression that Ave were not disclosing all our avail-able tonnage, and it was quite certain that are had the samesuspicions of the United States Government, and with more reason.He thought that something should be done to try and convince theUnited States Government of the magnitude of our effort in regardto shipping, and Avith that purpose in view he proposed to see Mr. Hoover before the latter returned to America.Mr. Massey said that, from an Australian and New Zealandpoint of view, the shipping position was most serious. He was afraid that unless immediate steps were taken we should find that thefinancial and commercial position of these two countries would be so seriously affected that their capacity for carrying on the war wouldbe. materially hampered. He thought that the serious position ofaffairs should be made known to the Imperial War Cabinet.
6. The Prime Minister read out to the -meeting a telegram of thanks from Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, in answer to the telegram of congratulations from the Imperial War Cabinet sent onthe previous day.7. Sir Rennell Rodd, resuming the discussion on War Aims,suggested that a good deal of what had been criticised as Imperialisticaims on the part of Italy were really defensive aims connected with her position in the Adriatic and in the Mediterranean generally.There had been in recent months a great change of view with regardto the Bohemian and South Slav questions. Baron Sonnino would either have to acquiesce in that change or resign. His attitude was based, firstly, on the idea that Italy should not be expected to renounce her claims unless there was a general renunciation allround, and, secondly, on the fear that a Jugo-Slav State, underwhatever auspices it started, would eventually fall within the orbitof the Central Powers. Relations with Greece were much more satisfactory, and he believed Italy would agree to a settlement inconnection with the iEgean Islands, providing she retained some one point, e.g., Rhodes, for herself.Mr. Massey. though disposed to regard the suggestion that palestine should be entrusted to the United States as worthy of consideration, was not prepared to agree to the idea that Americashould be given any of the Pacific Islands which we had conquered.These islands, and more especially Samoa, from its strategic position,would be of the greatest consequence to the great British population which was destined to inhabit the Southern Pacific in the future.He illustrated the strategic importance of these islands from theexperiences of the first few months of the war, and concluded byexpressing the hope that when our delegates went to the PeaceConference they would be definitely united on the policy ,of norestoration to Germany and no condominium. As far as Australiaand New Zealand were concerned, nothing would be satisfactory tothem except the retention by Britain of the German Pacific Islands.Mr. Hughes said that as regards the Pacific Islands his attitude was that if anyone wanted to shift Australia from them they wouldhave to come and do it! On the general cpuestioh, he wished to have time for more careful consideration. What was essential was thatthere should be complete agreement in the Imperial War Cabinet asto what the attitude of the British delegates at the Peace conference should be, and, as far as he could see, that complete agreement hadnot yet been established. From the point of view of Australia, itwas vital that she should have a voice in the settlement before itwas made, and he should like, if possible, to have these matterssettled definitely before he returned to Australia.General Smuts suggested that Mr. Balfour had stated our peace  aims from the Foreign Office point of view  and on the message of congratulation toField-marshal sir Douglas Haig.Mr. Chamberlain said that if the United States could beprevailed upon to provide more of the stores for supplying their army from their own country instead of from England, he thought this would ease the tonnage situation.Lord Ptobert Cecil said that he thought the whole positionrequired looking into, and drastic remedies would be needed. he considered that the whole economic position should be put into thehands of one individual, and that we should prevail upon our allies to do the same.It was decided that Whilst realising the critical position of the shipping question, itwould be impossible, in the circumstances, not to accede tothe request that we should detail three ships to carry fkavrto Archangel.
assumption of the complete defeat of the enemy.   He could not seethat the programme based on that assumption was justified by thepresent military  situation.   He did  not suppose   that  anythingwould happen materially to affect that situation during the presentyear.   Nor had he any expectation that the Allies would be able to force a  decision in 1919 on the Western   front,  which,  by theexperience both of the enemy and ourselves, had always proved afatal theatre to the attacking party.   He doubted the possibility ofa real restoration of the Russian front, and feared that the enemy,giving   ground   slowly  on the  West, would  concentrate a con-siderable   effort,  mainly   carried  out by Turkish  troops,  in theEast.   The  menace there was to ourselves and no one else, and what he feared was the campaign of 1919 ending inconclusivelyin the West and- leaving our whole position in the East damaged and in danger.   He was very loth  to   look forward   to   1920.Undoubtedly   Germany   would   be   lost   if   the   war   continuedlong enough.    But was that worth our while ?    Our Army wouldshrink progressively, and we might find ourselves reduced, beforethe war ended, to the&apos;position of a second-class Power comparedwith America and Japan.    It was no use achieving the object of destroying Germany at the cost of the position of our own Empire.From this point of view he considered many of the items in theForeign Secretary&apos;s programme not as war aims to be secured inthe treaty of peace, but as things that would come of themselves inthe revolution which would follow the war.    His own suggestion was that we should concentrate on those theatres where our militaryand diplomatic effort could be most effectively brought to beartogether, i.e., against   our  weaker  enemies :   Austria,  Bulgaria,and Turkey.    A serious  offensive  from  Italy  against  Austria,efforts   to   widen   the  breach   between   Bulgaria  and   Turkey,and  hard  blows  struck at Turkey itself, were the objects weshould concentrate upon.     Beyond  that, we should perfect our economic policy, not necessarily as a settled post-war policy, but as a -sword to hang over Germany, and a safeguard in the event ofincomplete victory.   With regard to the German Colonies, he pointedout that the Germans themselves now concentrated all their colonialambitiorn on the establishment of a great, solid block across Africa.This block, with its potentialities of a huge black army and of sub-marine bases threatening the whole of our world-traffic, could not be conceded.   In this issue our principal trouble would be with theUnited States, and it wrould be essential to conciliate them by bringing them into the business.    The suggestion which he hadalready made was that, while we should retain the German Coloniesterritorially, the whole of tropical Africa should be placed under a development Board, the Presidency of which should be entrusted to    1the United States.A certain amount of discussion&apos; followed as to the precise scope and powers of such a Development Board and of its relations to theactual territorial Sovereign. It was pointed out that the schemewas susceptible of immense modifications according as practically all the powers were given to the Board and territorial sovereigntylimited to police duties, or the Board confined to the mere overseeingof the carrying out of certain treaty restrictions. It was also pointed out that the other colonial. Powers affected might object tosuch a Board, most of all, perhaps, a Power like Portugal, in whosecase external control was most desirable.(The discussion was  adjourned to  11*30 a.m.  on Thursday,  the15th August, 1918.)A&apos;full report of the discussion on War Aims will be circulated as aseparate document.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,August 14, 1918.
