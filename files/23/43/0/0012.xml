SIR RENNELL RODD : I ought to begin by saying that a great deal of what has in the past been criticised as Imperialistic ambition on the part of Italy has beennot so much Imperialistic as defensive. In any case the last few months have made agreat difference as regards the Italian view of the Czecho-Slovaks and South Slavquestions. There is, I may almost say, now in Italy a real enthusiasm for the Bohemianquestion. Bohemia, as one looks upon it on the map, is a Slav country, almost entirelysurrounded by non-Slav countries, with the exception of where it touches Poland. It,therefore, is a kind of enclave. It is almost inconceivable that Bohemia could acquirecomplete independence, and be taken away from the Austrian Empire, and that thatEmpire should still survive. That is the way the Italian looks at it, and he says if youare to clear away the heart it follows that the lower limbs must go too. It is perfectlytrue, as the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said, that great opposition has been experienced on these questions from Baron Sonnino. When I left Rome three weeks ago -Baron Sonnino&apos;s position was practically this. The most important political factor in Parliament had determined to force his resignation. I think he would be willing togo ; he has been working single-handed ; he is a man who does everything himself, andemploys hardly anybody in his office, and I think he would quite readily go on thegrounds of ill-health. Perhaps a year ago I should have looked upon this as aserious matter for the Allied cause, but I think we can now afford to letBaron Sonnino go. He has done his work well, and has been of great service to us, but I think there are many questions which would work easier withouthim. It is difficult to say this of an old friend, and of a Minister for whom I have the highest respect. At the same time he may remain, and, ifhe does remain, it will be that he will come into line with the new prevailingviews. I think it is only fair to him just to explain to you what is the view he has taken on this question. It is not a mere question of Imperialism. He is convinced that thearguments he brings forward are valid. There are two points which he raises. he says if we are to renounce, no doubt all the existing agreements must be revised. Heis the first to recognise that the new developments have changed the whole situation.He says : &quot; If we are to renounce, do not let me be tlie only one asked to renounce. Ifthere is to be renunciation, I do not wish to be affected alone.&quot; I think there is sometruth in it. He says there is no tendency on the part of France to renounce her claims.Certain things have been assured to France, and the Allies are supporting her claims in regard to Alsace-Lorraine. He views with great suspicion the activities of Picot inthe East, and he says : &quot; I will renounce if I have to, but I do not wish to renounceeverything and then find that nobody else has renounced anything.&quot; With regardto the question of the Southern Slavs; he says he has not been very favourable tothem, not because he has any particular animosity to them, but because he looksahead. His view is.that they may be perfectly ready at the present moment to bury all their religious and other differences, and to work together with theAllies for their common ends. Their own ends are independence, if possible ; if not,autonomy. The peoples of Jugo-Slavia, however, are very remote from most of the Allies,especially from the more powerful Allies they are very far aw^ay from France and our-selves. From Italy they are separated by the Adriatic Sea and mountain ranges. Onthe other hand, the whole of their land frontiers are coterminous with the Magyar orGermanic races, to some extent also with Bulgaria, also in the south. The Germanicquestion, however, is for us the important one. Though for the time being the animosityengendered by war may continue, he does not believe it is possible to constitute apermanent buffer-State keeping Germany off the Mediterranean through the Jugo-Slavsalone. He thinks that economically and commercially they must eventually gravitatetowards the people with whom they have had long association, and with whom they must do trade. It must be their object in the end to conciliate them, and in that way germany will come down and exercise her influence in the Mediterranean through these Jugo-Slavcountries, which she will gradually economically bind with herself. Therefore, he says :Do not let us prematurely renounce any strategic points which may be valuable to us tosecure, and which we may theoretically have secured by understandings among the Allieswhich will be useful to keep Germany away from the Mediterranean, and especially from the Adriatic. That is the line of argument he follows, and although I do notthink it is necessary to agree, at the same time I.think it is an argument which is worthstudying and worth respect. As regards the other points which the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs raised, namely, the rivalry between France and Italy, it is unfor-unfortunately a very vital fact and one which we have to recognise. Of course that also is a mediterranean question. Italy is exclusively a Mediterranean Power with a veryexposed coast line all round; France has an opening to three seas, but Italy only exists
in the Mediterranean. Tunis is only separated from Sicily by a short distance, andfrom Tunis all the way.to Gibraltar the whole coast is under the control of France.Therefore, Italy views with considerable apprehension the idea of any larger extensionof French territory on the Mediterranean coast. Hence her apprehensions about-Syria.As regards the historic claims in Syria, Italy says with some justice : If you talk of history, my historical claims to any of these countries that have been civilised by Italyor where the population is largely Italian are just as historical as any claim France could possibly raise in regard to Syria. That is the kind of argument one meets there. Ido not see any very great prospect of doing anything more than just keeping theserivalries under. The French have not helped; they are always treating Italy in adictatorial way and with a certain amount of prepotency ; and the Italians are sensitive.They consider they have an economic future; they have a perpetually increasingpopulation, whereas France has a decreasing population, or at any rate a stationary one.They believe that in a few months&apos; time Italy will be independent in regard to ironand steel owing to their discovery of big irou deposits in Val d&apos;Aosta. This will be agreat commercial development. Their only outlet to the world is the Mediterranean,about which they feel sensitive. I think that is only fair to bear this in mind when theItalians are accused of being unnecessarily sensitive in regard to France and theMediterranean Sea.As regards the ^aegean Islands, there has been in the last few months a considerablerapprochement between Italy and Greece. The removal of a very troublesome element in the shape of the former Italian Minister at Athens has led to very excellent results, and from what I have gathered from conversations with thinking people in Italy that if Greece will cultivate friendly relations with Italy I do not think there will be any great difficulty in a settlement for the handing over of a large numberof those Turkish islands to Greece. I believe Italy will wish to keep a point there (itmight be Rhodes, where the population is chiefly Mussalmen, as distinct from the otherislands) especially in view of what may happen in the Eastern Mediterranean, in order tohave a link between the Black Sea and the Eastern Mediterranean trade. I have heardlately very favourable reports indeed of the Italian activities in the development of thecountry she has occupied, especially the country round Valona. British officers havespoken to me in the highest terms of the work which has been done in the developmentof that country. I think those are the three main points raised by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs, and I do not think there is anything more that I can say ofany value.MR. BARNES : What is the new development by which the Italians will get more iron ?,; SIR RENNELL 110DD : The discovery in the mountains of enormous depositsof iron found under the snow an almost inexhaustible supply of good iron ore whichit is proposed to develop by the use of water-power both, for mining and for smeltingpurposes.MR. BONAR LAW : I have heard so often about these developments that I amsomewhat sceptical. Signor Nitti told me that in this case it was a finer analysis thanthat of the. Swedish ore.SIR RENNELL RODD : It has not been discovered before because it has beenconcealed under the snow.THE PRIME MINISTER : I think you have something to say, Mr. Massey, inregard to the German colonies.MR, MASSEY : With regard to the German colonies, following up whatSir Robert Borden said, Mr. Prime Minister, I would just like to say this, while I amvery glad, and nobody is better pleased than myself that America has at last realisedits duty to civilisation.and has come into the war, still I do not know that that is any reason why we should hand over the German colonies to the United States, even astrustees. I am not altogether opposed to your suggestion with regard to Palestine ; Ithink that is worthy of consideration, and especially in view of the fact, which is perhaps a sentimental reason, that the people of the United States are of the samestock as ourselves. If we are going to part with it, if it is not going to remain in the possession of the British, I would sooner see it go to the United States, either astrustee, or in any other way, than to any other nation. I have no doubt general smuts will have something to say about the African colonies. . But I cannot agree that
the Pacific colonies, that is to say, the islands occupied by Germany and in possessionof Germany, should even go to America, We do not know what may happen in thenext twenty years ; we may be at war with America. I hope not; I do not think forone moment we shall; I think we shall always continue to be friends.ME. BARNES : Are you referring to the North Pacific ?MR. MASSEY : No, I am speaking of the islands south of the line. So far asthe islands north are concerned, I am content to abide by the agreement. I say thaton behalf of New Zealand. I cannot help recollecting that America is supposed to bevery strong on what is called the Monroe Doctrine, but they have not applied it totheir own conditions. I cannot help recollecting what has taken place with regard tothe Philippines, and the Hawaii Islands, and even part of the Samoa Islands. perhaps the members of the Imperial War Cabinet will recollect that America is to-day inpossession of a very important island in the latter group, known as Pago-Pago;, which isprobably the very best harbour in the Pacitic. I do not mean to say it is valuablefrom the producing point of view, but the harbour is there, and there is no question about it that the nation which controls the Samoan group has a tremendous advantage,even more so than the possession of what is called German New Guinea. I do notthink that German New Guinea any more than Samoa should pass under the controlof any foreign Power outside the British. We have to look to the future, and there isno question about it that there is going to be in time to come a very large population of British citizens in the South Pacific, and I think it would be exceedingly dangerous for them if we allow Germany to come into the South Pacificand occupy Samoa, as before the war, or occupy New Guinea. I am particularly strongin regard to Samoa, because I cannot get away from what has already taken place.It was the headquarters of the German fleet in the South Pacific ; and it was the headquarters of trading in the South Pacific. Members will recollect what happened to the squadron. If Samoa had not been handed over very improperly to Germany,there would not have been a German fleet in the Pacific at the outbreak of the war,and we should not have sustained such disasters. We were called upon by the BritishGovernment to send an exjaedition to Samoa. We took the risk, and we sent it, thoughit was a tremendous risk.THE PRIME MINISTER : How many miles was it ?MR. MASSEY : About 1,500 or 1,600. It was a tremendous risk, consideringthat at the time there were five German cruisers in the South Pacific. Whatsaved us the Germans did not know it was the battle cruiser &quot; Australia.&quot; TheGermans were not aware of this, otherwise the New Zealand Expeditionary Force would never have got to Samoa,MR. HUGHES : That was an oversight on our part that we did not inform them !MR. MASSEY&quot; : They got there all right, though we had a long way to go. Whenwar broke out we were called upon to send our Expeditionary Force, practically withoutescort, to Albany about ten days&apos; steam. I took upon myself to flatly7 refuse. I said it was madness. In the first place the instructions came along and we actually sent out two ships from Auckland, and eight ships were to go from Wellington the samenight. We got a warning from Australia that the Pacific was dangerous, and we held the ships in Wellington, and we called back the ships that had gone from Auckland.We brought them down to Wellington and a few days afterwards came word to send them up. i took upon my-self to refuse. I told the Governor-General that if the ships were sent out I could no longer retain the position of Prime Minister, and he cabledto the Imperial Government with the request that an escort should be sent; andthe escort was sent, A first-class Japanese cruiser came down and escorted our troops to Australia and then picked up the Australian troops and then went on. The&quot; Sydney- &quot; joined them as an additional escort at Albany, and that was the trip whenthe &quot; Emden &quot; was sunk. The &apos;.&apos; Emden&quot; was watching those troops from the momentthey left Wellington to the Keeling Islands. That is the result of allowing theGermans to come into the Pacific. I am not finding fault with the Imperial WarCabinet; and 1 have every7 possible confidence that you will do the right thing, but Ido not know what will happen when you come to the Peace Conference. At anyrate, I do hope that when we go to the Peace Conference, so far as the German Coloniesare concerned, We shall be united on one point- that they will not go back toGermany, and that we shall have nothing in the way of a condominium. We have hadexperience, and you have had experience.   We have had experience with our friends
the French, but no one can say that the condominium, in connection with the new hebrides was satisfactory ; indeed nothing was more unsatisfactory. I want to make myposition perfectly clear, that nothing would be satisfactory to the people of Australiaand New Zealand except the retention by the British of the Samoan Islands.Mr. Hughes is more concerned with New Guinea than I am, and I leave him to speakso far as that is concerned. The South Pacific is practically British now, and we want to keep it British. If we do not do it, if there is any weakness in this connection,we shall have the same trouble over again as we have had during the past fiveyears, and that trouble was due to weakness in days gone by. The mistake was made when the Samoan Islands, which were so important from a strategic point of view, weregiven over to Germany.MR. HUGHES : What are we asked to discuss, Mr. Prime Minister ? The whole situation ?THE PRIME MINISTER : Yes.MR. HUGHES: That will take a-considerable time. I am not going to say a word about the Pacific ; 1 have already said what I want to say, and my views areperfectly well known. I am not going to sa)r one word about America or any other country, but I am going to say this : that I assume that there is no doubt in the minds of the members of the Cabinet as to what the attitude of the British Government orthe British delegates to the Peace Conference will be on this matter. If there is any doubt now is the time to declare it. While I am not able to speak as to what the feelings of the Australians will be, all I have to say is, that my attitude is : &quot; If youwant to shift us, come and do it; here we are &apos; J&apos;y suis, j&apos;y reste.&apos;&quot; That is theposition, and I think it is fairly right. With regard to these other matters which areinfinitely complex and difficult, I should like to have an opportunity of carefullyconsidering the statement made by Mr. Balfbur yesterday, and to read the report ofthe Committee on the League of Nations, which, unfortunately for myself, I have notread, and which I have now found. I have here a little pile of documents which, -bythe blessing of Providence, has escaped me until this moment, and I am going through them. I am not going to stand committed to any policy until I understand things.I hear talk about disposing of the Balkan problem in this way and that way; aboutRussia, Turkey, Alsace, Italy, and all these things, and what the attitude of thePresident will be or will not be. These are very, difficult problems, but I assume thatthese other people will also have something to say on these matters. The problems ofwhich Sir Robert Borden and Mr. Massey have been speaking are problems upon whichwe can decide what our attitude will be, but what are the delegates at the PeaceConference going to say, and what is the Government going to say in the interimthrough its privileged mouthpieces ? When we come to these other questions I think we ought to discuss them and try and get some idea of what we are fighting for.Nearly every day events take a new aspect, and I have here a statement of the things that have been said about a League of Nations, Rights of People, Economic War,Freedom of the Seas, the Attitude of President Wilson, statements by Mr. Asquith,Mr. Balfour, and yourself, Mr. Prime Minister, and no doubt there will be other state-ments yet. The difficulty will be, of course, to reconcile some of them and to continueall this time and not make statements that-will hopelessly embarrass and entangle us.I want to say this on behalf of Australia; we came into this war because we were partof the Empire, a,nd we heartily approve of this war, but of course you may get us intoa war to-morrow which we may not heartily approve, and therefore it is vital we shallhave some opportunity of moulding the foreign policy of this country before it is made.I mean foreign policy in regard to that settlement after the war which is to be permanent, because it is equitable and because it is practicable and because it takescognizance of facts. One fact is, of course, to. which I have already directed yourattention, namely, that we are in these colonies and we propose to stay there. Thereis another fact; France went to war and for fifty years, more or less, she had her eyeon Alsace-Lorraine. Germany determined to hold it. France is determined to get it back. These are facts; and there are others. So when we speak of equity, of coursethere are conflicting claims for the consideration of the Court, and no doubt they willhave that attention they deserve. I am unable to say anything of a useful natureabout this, but I do say this, that before I return to Australia I should like to havethese things settled definitely, so that we know where we are on all these matters.MR. BONAR LAW : But events change.[543-7]
MR,. HUGHES: I know ; but we are like corks in a stream ; neither is there achannel buoyed, nor is there anybody pointing out the way. Clemenceau says one thing ; we agree. President Wilson says another ; we avoid it, we soothe him. Whereare we going to and what do we propose ultimately ?MR. BONAR LAW : We shall be lucky if we do not have the same experienceas we had after the revolutionary war with France.MR. HUGHES : It should be in this matter as in all others, men may not beable to say precisely by what means they are going, but they should know wherethey are going to.   We do not even know where we desire to go.MR. CHAMBERLAIN: We surely know where we desire to go ; the question is :Can we get there and stop there ? Nobody who heard the Foreign Secretary&apos;s speechwould fail to have a clear idea of what the desiderata of our Government are.MR. HUGHES: What evidence is there that the Foreign Secretary&apos;s opinions arethose of the British Government ?MR. CHAMBERLAIN: That is what you are invited to discuss now. If youdiffer you should express your differences.MR.. HUGHES : Mr. Balfour sets before us the facts, and the benefit of his advice; he admitted freely that there were alternative courses to pursue. I have just glanced at a report which Lord Curzon prepared, last year I think it was. Thatcovered, in part, some of the things that were discussed the other day. I am not sure,you know, especially after what Sir Robert Borden said yesterday, what are the opinions on such a relatively minor matter, if you like to put it so, as the question ofthose colonies which were lately German. That is a relatively minor matter, thoughit is a matter of fundamental importance not merely to us -in Australia, but very greatimportance to the Empire. *- MR. BALFOUR : I was quite clear as to what my view was.MR. HUGHES : Of course you were ; but other people have been just as clearon the. other side. Three people have spoken, Sir Robert Borden has spoken, andalso Mr. Massey ; will anyone say their opinions coincide ?THE PRIME MINISTER: Let us have your opinion.MR. HUGHES ; I have none. I am here to try and find out what are thefacts, and I do not pretend to swim easily in these waters at&apos;all.MR. BARNES : But you had a very definite view about the South Pacific.MR. HUGHES : Human nature is very much the same the world over you know.THE. PRIME MINISTER: Let us hear what General Smuts has to say aboutAfrica.GENERAL SMUTS : I do not like to strike a discordant note, Prime Minister,but last year, when we had our conference in April 1917, I expressed certain views inthis Cabinet which then seemed to be heterodox, but I think the events of the lasteighteen months have added force to what I said, and the subjects we are discussingnow are so important and far-reaching, not only for this country, but for many othercountries, that I think we ought to discuss in the most thorough manner all these issues and see what is the best line for us to take. Mr. Balfour, in a most interesting and ablestatement, one of the most interesting that has been given in this room, has stated our peace aims, but he has done so entirely from the Foreign Office point of view, and it isimpossible, I think, to settle a question like this purely from a Foreign Office point ofview. Of course our aims may be quite good in themselves, and yet may be unattain-able. It is, after all, the war situation that settles these matters, and when we discussour war. aims it seems to me the fundamental factor to discuss is : what is the war position and are we entitled to look forward are we justified in looking forward to the attainment of our aims, considering the war position as it is to-day or as it may develop in the immediate future ? Mr. Balfour&apos;s programme, as I understood ityesterday, seemed to me to assume the complete and final defeat of the enemy. I notedthe principal points he referred to. In regard to Alsace-Lorraine he said we must continue to fight for the possession of these provinces for France, unless Francevoluntarily waived her claims.   With regard to Italy, she has our bond;, and the bond
7156-stipulates for a number of conditions which Italy can renounce, but which we cannot.Whether these terms are reasonable or not it is not for us to say. Austria must be destroyed ; if she remains as she is she will be a German satellite, so she must be destroyed even at the risk of the German part of Austria going to Germany, and therest must become independent States Hungary, Czecbo-Slavia, Jugo-Slavia, &amp;c.We are bound further to establish a united Poland, with access to the sea. Wemust destroy the Brest-Litovsk Treaty. With regard to the Balkan question, in trying to deal diplomatically either with Turkey or Bulgaria, we must not touch any territory which belongs now either to Greece or to Serbia, because they will not allow that, and itmight, for very good reasons, have fatal consequences. Palestine we cannot restore tothe Turks; we most make some other arrangement with regard to Palestine, either under an American Protectorate, or a British Protectorate, or an international Protec-torate. Mesopotamia must be an Arab Statue under British jarotection. The german colonies must under no circumstances be restored to Germany. However goodthat programme may be in itself if it has to be carried out, it presupposes to my mind, a complete smashing a complete military defeat of Germany, and when I askmyself whether there is anything in the present situation that justifies such a programmeI am most doubtful. I do not think that programme is justified as the military situationis to-day. What is the situation ? Only a few months ago we were in the gravestanxiety about Paris, and about the Channel ports. Since then we have bad three verybrilliant counter-strokes. We have driven the enemy back from certain areas ; we haverecovered about one-third of the territory which the enemy has taken from us since last march, and if we wish to recover the other two-thirds this year, or next year, it willprobably mean very bloody fighting and very heavy losses to us. That is the situation.The situation, since last year, when we discussed our war aims, has not really improved.No doubt the submarine peril has lessened, or largely disappeared ; the American army has come in as a tremendous factor, but there are dangers in other directions for us.On the continent of Europe Germany has had enormous successes. The Russian army has disappeared ; the Roumanian army has disappeared. Most disastrous peace treatieshave been concluded with the Russians and the Roumanians, so that the whole situation as it has developed since last year when we discussed these questions and as it standsto-day, does not justify a very ambitious programme on our part at all, and thequestion arises : What about the future ? How, as sane, wise, sober men, can we look forward to the development of the war situation for the balance of this year and next yearand thereafter ? I assume that nothing material is going to happen for the rest of thisyear. We have all read the statement of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, andwe may assume that no great operations are likely to be undertaken this year, unlessperhaps in Italy, although that seems doubtful. What military situation can we look forward to in 1919 ? We shall have in 1919, not only British and French armies, butalso the American army massed in the West, and the question arises whether, in 1919,these armies will give us a decision in the West. Our experience hitherto of the West hasbeen a very fatal experience; so also has the experience of the Germans. The Westhas always been a fatal theatre to the attacking party. The defence has such enormousadvantages that, after four years of the most bloody fighting in the history of the world,and with our respective armies on both sides at their best, neither side has been able to force a decision in the West.Now what difference will the Americans make ? The Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff calculates that next year we can take the offensive in the West with a reserve ofseventy divisions. I ask myself quite soberly and dispassionately: Will seventy reserve divisions be able to give us the decision in the West next year ? I do not think so ;I do not look forward to that. I do not know with how many reserve divisons theGermans started their offensive on the 21st March, but if our expectations have to be guided by the German gains since the 2ist March, then I do not think seventy reserve divisions are likely to force any decision in the West. I am afraid that whilstbloody fighting will go on in the West, the Germans- will return to their oldpolicy of assuming a purely defensive attitude in the West, of retiring slowlybecause they have very much ground to give up before ever we get to points vital to them, and in the meantime trying to stabilise their position in the East.They have the whole of the East before them. We are not going to have a russian front; what with this trouble we have had with America and Japan, itseems to me unlikely that there will be a real re-establishment of the Russian front.The Germans have the Black Sea, which is now a German lake ; they have a fleet atOdessa and a railway right on to Baku, which they may take any time, and there is thedanger that they may cross the Caspian and get on to the borders of India.   The Turks
have seven divisions in North-West Persia, and they are already evidently preparing the population there and raising armies there, and&apos; the probability is that next year wemay find a very great offensive in the East launched against us by the Turks, and to a minor extent by the Germans. Nobody- concerned in this war except ourselves hasany interest in Asia. If Persia comes under Turkish influence, if the Turks get toTranscaspia, and if this wave extends even to Afghanistan, our position in Asia is verymuch endangered. Certainly no other Western Power is affected at all by it. therefore the dangers that we have to face are these : That in 1919 there will be no decision inthe West ; we may reach the end of 1919 with the West still an indecisive theatre. In themeantime, our position in the East has been damaged very, very seriously. It is verydifficult for us to meet the enemy there. We have from the coast to cross mountain barrierswhich are very difficult, and the enemy has enormous advantages in that theatre of theEast. That is our danger. If there is to be no decision in 1919, what are we to look forward to % Must we look forward to 1920 ? I am very loth, Prime Minister, to look forward to 1920. There is no doubt that by prolonging the war indefinitely Germany7will lose, but the question which- arises is : Is it worth while to us ? What is ourposition going to be ? The War Office submitted a paper as to our army at the end of1919. This year we started with sixty-two divisions, and it appears from this paper that, if we have the fighting that we look forward to in 1919, we shall, at the end ofthat time, have thirty-one divisions, which means that our army will have gone downby half, and if we have to look forward to 1920 and to serious fighting then, our army will practically have disajDpeared, and so will that of France, and I dare say the germans will also suffer badly. It may well be that, by the indefinite continuance of the war, weshall become a second or third-class Power, and the leadership, not only financially andmilitarily, but in every respect, will have passed on to America and to Japan. europe will have fought itself out to a finish, and she will have been utterly smashed, and not even the roots of future progress would be left in her. When we look at questions suchas we are considering here, we have to consider very carefully how we are going to beaffected by them whether, in the attempt to prolong the war and to smash Germany,we may find that we have achieved our object, but at the cost of our own life and the life of the Empire, and Germany is indeed broken but we are broken too, and we have sunk toa second or third-class Power. 1 am very much against fighting it to the absolute end,because I think that, although that end will be fatal to the enemy, it may possibly be fatal to us too.I should like to make a few suggestions about this matter. I do not look forward to an absolute end of this war from a military point of view. I think the attemjjts tofight out this war until the enemy is utterly smashed in a military7 sense has too greatdangers for us too. Complete military victory may be attainable, but the risksthat we are running are too great and we have to take a more moderate line.The war has lasted four years; if it lasts some years more the risks will be too great. I would say this, Prime Minister, that as soon as the military tidehas really7 turned, and it is turning now7 as soon as it has really turned andit is clear to us that the enemy is going under, and the enemy does come tous, as I am sure he will come, and is prepared to concede those terms which weconsider essential, then we should be prepared to make peace, and not fight it out to the absolute end which may be disastrous to us too. I think the dangerof continuing the war beyond such a point, the point when the enemy is going down,is too great, and when&apos;be comes to us prepared to concede our essential terms, that is thetime we should make every effort to obtain peace, even though the German armies maynot have been smashed to the extent some people would like and although we may nothave reached that complete military predominance which we have considered desirable.THE PRIME MINISTER: Are you going to deal with what you consider theessential terms ?GENERAL SMUTS: Yes ; if we apply this to Mr. Balfours programme, then Icome to this conclusion, that a great deal of that programme is&apos;not really the programmeof this war, but a programme of the future, and will be settled by the years thatwill follow the war rather than by the peace. Take the case of Poland. I am sure that although we have pledged ourselves to stand by a free Poland, we are not going tocontinue the war for that purpose.MR. BALFOUR: It is not a pledge.GENERAL SMUTS: It seems to me that it is a very difficult question; thePoles want a free country although they have proved just as incapable of governing
themselves as the Irish ; even more so. They may become the prey to any greatmilitary Power, and we are not going to sacrifice the civilisation of the world for the attainment of a free Poland.Then there is the breaking-up of Austria. Whether that is a good thing for theworld is to my mind doubtful, too. It seems to me these &quot;are not war aims ; these arethings which may be accomplished in the revolution which will follow the war, just as things are now being done after the Russian revolution. The)&apos; made peace at Brest, butthey found that peace has not settled anything, and that the revolution is going to accom-plish a very different&quot; settlement than the one which they envisaged in that treaty.That is why, I think, a number of these questions relate to the political programme ofthe future and not to the war.Then you have Alsace-Lorraine, the Italian claims to Daimatia and parts of&apos;Austrian-Tyrol, and so on. I am almost inclined to put these things on the doubtful list.Of course we have our Allies, and we have, to stand by them, but I do not think that inthe last resort we should be justified infolding our arms and saying: These are ouragreements, and we must stand by these agreements to the very end. I think thiscountry, and the Government of this country, has the gravest responsibility for thefuture, and the time may come when, in our own judgment, we must speak toour Allies. I should say with regard to our programme, Prime Minister, which Iconsider even more military than diplomatic, that, for the future, we must limit ouractivities to those theatres and to those points where we can bring to bear, inco-operation, both the military and the diplomatic factors. And we should do so at theweakest points of the enemy&apos;s armour. I do not consider the Western front in thatlight, and I do not consider that Germany is the weak point. I do not think,that is a very fruitful field, and I would advise concentration on the weaker members-of the enemy&apos;s combination-Austria, Bulgaria, and Turkey. We should do everything possible, both diplomatically and in a military sense, to finish off these three countries.Instead of massing our armies in the west, we must consider very carefully whetherthe time has not come to launch, either this year or early next year, a great attack against Austria from Italy, reinforcing Italy strongly, and instead of wasting all our forces in this impossible theatre in the west, try really to finish Austria. Austria, withouta doubt, is in the most desperate condition, all our information leads to that conclusion.Austria is getting ripe ; the pear is getting ripe on the tree, but the pear will not fallso long as we keep shaking another tree. The same applies to Bulgaria and Turkey.I quite understand what Mr. Balfour says, that we must be very careful about theattitude of Greece and Serbia, who are Allies and co-belligerents with us, but Ithink that something ought to be done there in the Balkans, and the best I can see-that can be done is to set Bulgaria and Turkey against each other. There is no doubt,from the information which is coming through to us, that trouble already exists betweenthem. Although we cannot at this stage promise Bulgaria any territory which now belongs to Serbia or Greece, certainly Bulgaria might be set going against Turkey,,and I cannot understand why we should have any objection to Bulgaria going right on.to Constantinople, although objections might have arisen at one time.MR. MASSEY: Why?GENERAL SMUTS : At one stage it could not be done because Russia wouldhave opposed it, but we are now in a stage when we could not do it without Greecegetting angry. Bulgaria has behaved treacherously to us and feeling is against her inthe Balkans, and also among our own Allies, but it seems to me that if the thing couldbe done that wpuld be the best course. We have very much to fear from Turkey inthe immediate future in this war. Turkey at one time was on the point of going outof the war, but this Russian peace has given her the old provinces in the Caucasus ; she has new areas which possess millions of Turks, and where no doubt she is training armiesfor the future, and in their advance to the East the Germans are going to make use ofthe Turks more than anything else. I do not think they will send many german divisions on to Trans-Caspia, but they will use the Turks as far as possible, and what-ever we can do to finish off the Turks, and make it impossible for them to launch this attack against us in the East, should, I think, be done by us. That I think should be our war policy underlying our peace aims Austria, Bulgaria, and Turkey should be dealtwith rather than Germany. Beyond that, Prime Minister, I would perfect our economic policy, which I consider very essential, not as a settled post-war policy for us, but as a -sword to keep over. Germany. If our military victory is not going to be complete inthis war, then we must have safeguards. A League of Nations in itself is insufficient,and may not be the safeguard that we want, but if we have a combination among the[543-71 D
Allied Powers which will be able to isolate Germany economically in the future if she doesnot play the game I think that would go far to complete the work of any military victory which we may achieve. I think we should endeavour to reach some economic agreementbetween the Allies not as a separate post-war policy, but a policy which will come intooperation if Germany does not play the game after the war.LORD ROBERT CECIL : Are you going to deal with Palestine and Meso-potamia ?GENERAL SMUTS : I am in general agreement with what has been said about them. I am quite sure that the Brest-Litovsk Treaty has created a condition which isimpossible for the future peace of the world, and I cannot conceive any clearerindication of a German defeat than that she should have to agree to the abrogationof the Roumanian Treaty and the Russian Treaties ; I think that would be a tremendousblow to her prestige.With regard to the German colonies, there is no doubt that the point is of extreme importance and very difficult. That may be gathered from Kiihlmann&apos;s lastspeech, in which he gave three German war aims : the first was the maintenance of the oldfrontiers of Germany, &quot;the frontiers which history has made for us,&quot; he said; thesecond is the freedom of the seas free movement over the seas in peace-time and freedom of trade in the world ; and the third is a colonial Empire &quot; corresponding to ourgreatness.&quot; He therefore puts in the forefront of German war aims a great colonial empire for Germany. A number of papers have been circulated already on this point,which is a very important point, and which will lead to the greatest difficulty at thePeace Conference. The paper which I have circulated gives some evidence toshow and I have folio wed the question fairly closely from the German publications,although my conclusions may be wrong- that the Germans have given up the hopeof recovering their Asiatic colonies. Very little is ever said about the Asiatic colonies-I mean the Pacific colonies. I wish that we in Africa were as safe as Mr. Hughes andMr. Massey are in the Pacific in this respect. The Germans are after a complete andsolid colonial block in Africa, which will include not only their own colonies, but some new ones the Portuguese colonies, which they almost had before the war, and probably the Congo, too. It is all supported by the pawn theory of. Hertling, in that speech,in which he said that Belgium is held as a pawn for good peace terms in regardto trade and colonies. It is quite clear that Belgium is being held as a pledge just asthe northern provinces of France are held in order to. enable Germany to recover hercolonies in Africa from us, so that she may have a block of colonies in Central Africa,including her own. The Germans, who are great theorists, planners, and organisers,know the tropics are essential for the future of their industries, and they want a greattropical block, and do not want to be entirely dependent upon our mercy and good-will for their future tropical raw materials, and they want to constitute this blockby keeping Belgium and Northern France as pledges in the meantime. It is^uite clear to all of us that we cannot concede them; the dangers have been pointed out over and over again. Germany not only wants a block of colonies in africa in order to secure her raw materials, but she wants to train a big black army;she says : &quot; France has done it, why not I&apos;? I will have 50,000,000 in a country whichwill be almost twice the size of India, I can train black armies to conquer the whole of africa.&quot; On the coasts she can establish submarine bases from which she can threaten the commerce of the world ; in fact she can accomplish all she desires by this meanswithout the Pacific colonies. The Red Sea route and the Cape route would be threatened. It is very clear to all that German desires cannot be met in that respect,but our greatest trouble is going to be our Allies, and especially America. The argu-ment was put here forcibly by Lord Reading to show that we shall have to be very careful. America is, of course, a great ally for war purposes, but she is going to be avery serious factor to deal with in regard to peace. She may be a greater troubleto us even than Germany in regard to peace, and it will be very necessary for us toattempt some arrangement by which we make America the president of someDevelopment Board in Central Africa, whilst these colonies are retained by ourselves and not restored to Germany. That Board should be an International Board, which- should be a sort of offshoot of the League of Nations if it comes into existence; Germanyalso being represented on this Board, which will see to the execution of this policy andto the distribution of the raw materials among the industrial nations of the world.America will thus see that we have no selfish object, and that the policy isintended to secure the future peace of the world. I would favour an international&quot;Board (on which  the  various Governments are represented, with  the leadership
given to some Power like America, whom we want to conciliate and carry with us. Ido not say it is an easy policy ; it is a most difficult policy, but we are going to be confronted in regard to the African colonies of Germany with the very gravest problem at the time of peace, and we must try if possible to eliminate that problem as far asthe Allies are concerned before we come to deal with the Germans.LORD MILNER : I quite grasp your idea, but who do you conceive should havedominion of this large territory ?    Is it to be divided among the different Powers ?GENERAL SMUTS : The Colonies would remain national.THE PRIME MINISTER : What about the German colonies ?GENERAL SMUTS : They would be kept by us-we should hold all of them andthere would be no restoration.LORD MTLNER : Germany would have the same commercial rights ?GENERAL SMUTS: Yes, and also would be represented on this Board, but would have no more national colonies.THE PRIME MINISTER: I want to know where our boundaries are. TakeGerman East Africa ; I take it we remain in possession. What are the functions of thisInternational Board ? Take, if you like, the question of Concessions, that is wherequarrels will come in, to a great extent. You have an application for a concession towork out an area, in regard to gold or anything else,- is that application to go theBoard or is it to go to the Government ?LORD MILNER : The Board, I should think.THE PRIME MINISTER: The Government then becomes purely a police weshould police the country. Who is to develop ? . Who is to borrow money to makerailways and to put boats on the lakes and that sort of thing ?GENERAL SMUTS : I assume that this International Board would see to that.LORD ROBERT CECIL : The idea is capable of immense modification. You may give almost everything to the Board, or you may give almost everything to the countrywhose flag is to fly over the territory. You might water it down so that it would be practically an ordinary dominion of the country with certain treaty restrictions as to free trade and as to treatment of natives, and so on, the International Board being theoverseers, or conversely you might give the whole thing to the International Board.THE PRIME MINISTER : I only want to see clearly what it means. What arethe relations of the Chartered Company and the Government ? I do not know whatthey are at the present moment in that country.LORD MILNER : The Chartered Company is the administrator of the territory and deals with rights in regard to minerals and so on. Land is now being declared to belong to the Government. .mTHE PRIME MINISTER : Who polices it ?LORD MILNER : The Chartered Company polices it. The Chartered company is an effective Government.LORD CURZON : There are several other difficulties, some of which I venturedto point out in some notes which I have circulated. The first difficulty in the schemeindicated by General Smuts is that you are going, to put Germany on to the governing body in so far as the International Board is a governing body, while she is to be theonly one of the European Powers that is to be allowed no territory at all. That is, ofcourse, a position she would only accept at the price of defeat. Secondly, you have todetermine the boundaries of - the area to which you propose to apply this system.General Smuts talked of this as a scheme for tropical Africa. Can you confine it totropical Africa? And if you confine it to tropical Africa, you at once bring in rhodesia and the Soudan.GENERAL SMUTS : Not Rhodesia.LORD CURZON-: Yes, Northern Rhodesia. Then, again, if you apply thissystem on this large scale, you have to get the consent not only of the Powers, mainlyourselves, who captured the German colonies during the war, but you have to get the
consent of all the European Powers as well the consent of France, of Italy, ofBelgium, and of Portugal. Then that means an entirely new system for the whole ofthe African colonies, and it means, before you offer that as a solution of the particular difficulty of the German colonies, you have to discuss the matter with all the Statesthat own dominion in Africa.THE PRIME MINISTER : I think it rests on this fundamental fact, that there isan essential difference between countries where you can have a white population andwhich cannot ultimately become white.MR. CHAMBERLAIN : Is it an essential part of General Smuts&apos;s scheme that itshould apply to the pre-war colonies of France, Belgium, Portugal, and England, as wellas to the conquered colonies of Germany ? I think it might apply to the german colonies which have been conquered.GENERAL SMUTS: That is a difficulty pointed out by Lord Curzon. My idea is quite elastic. .LORD MILNER: You would have a very large block if you were to take the congo and German East Africa.LORD CURZON : If you persuade Belgium to go in, you must persuade Portugalto go in. also.THE PRIME MINISTER : This is very important, and I suggest that we should adjourn till to-morrow morning at 11&apos;30, and then continue this discussion.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.
