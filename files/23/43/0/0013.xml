LORD CURZON: The general point of view which General Smuts tookyesterday seemed to be one of considerable pessimism, one that I do not thinkreflects the views of the Cabinet as a whole. I do not, of course, presume to disputeGeneral Smuts&apos; opinion on military questions, or on military grounds, but I couldnot help contrasting his speech yesterday afternoon with one which I did not hearhim deliver but which I remember reading a report of some six or eight months ago. It was delivered somewhere in the Midlands when, at a period of the warmuch less advantageous to ourselves than at present, he told his audience inemphatic terms that the defeat of Germany was certain.GENERAL SMUTS: I think here in the inner circle, when we are discussingthings seriously, we ought to weigh everything. This Cabinet is Imperial, and is going to break up in a short time, and some of its members are returning to theDominions, and I do not think any of us should go home under a wrong impressionas to the military possibilities.   That is why I laid stress on the other point of view.LORD CURZON: I am glad you did. If I may say so General Smuts is a verymeasured speaker, and I confess when I read that speech of his delivered somemonths ago, it cheered1 me more than anything I have read during the war. Hehas now told us that he laid excessive stress on the other side of the case yesterday; i hope he did, and I think if we look at the facts we shall find that he did. He spokeat a moment when the situation in France is far more favourable both as regards themilitary position, and as regards the m,oral of our troops, than at any time duringthe last year or more. He spoke at a time when our military advance there is, fromall I can learn, not yet exhausted. I am told that the policy of tapping which weare pursuing there can be continued during the winter, and is likely to be attended by substantial results, and I believe our Generals, in consequence of the better moral of our troops, hope to improve the position very considerably in the future.THE PRIME MINISTER: During the winter?LORD CURZON: I believe General Plumer is strongly in favour of doing soduring the winter.THE PRIME MINISTER: The policy of tapping right through the winter]LORD CURZON: Tapping up to the winter as long as it is possible. Thespirit and moral of our troops are higher than they have been for some time, and corre-correspondingly the moral of the Germans is less. We have to contrast their presentposition with the prospect that was held out to them and with what they were toldby Hindenburg and Ludendorff only a little time ago that they intended to separateithe French and the British Armies, to destro)r each in turn, and to get to theChannel Ports, results for the achievement of which Hindenburg was willing to sacrifice a million men. When we contrast that with what he has done, it seemsto me that the present moment is one of the happiest of the campaign rather thanone leading to despondent views.It seems to me further that General Smuts ignored, to some extent, the spirit ofthe various peoples. We in this country have gone through moments of depression;so has America; so has France, but, from all I can hear, the spirit of each of theAllied Powers is more confident, and more willing to go on now than it has ever been. As regards America, we are continually being brought into contact withauthorities from America. T was talking to a man of great moment, who is a personal friend of the President, only yesterday, and so far from the President, on whom we rely so much, and to whom we pay excessive deference, being likely to takethe same views as those expressed by General Smuts, I gathered from what he saidthat the President means to go on, and his people mean to go on, until Germanmilitarism is destroyed, and until the world is made possible for the civilised peopleswho inhabit it.Then, again, did npt General Smuts exaggerate the danger of the position inthe East? He spoke of the complete collapse of Russia. There really appear to be some signs of a reviving spirit and of renewed military effort there, and so far from being hopeless about Russia, I think the situation is not without real elements of hope.Again, as regards the East, about which I have spoken before to the WarCabinet, it is quite true that Germany, freed from the West, may direct her effortstowards the East, but General Smuts, yesterday, did not think she would do it with her own troops; he thought she would push Turkey in front of her. Well, we haveto look to that, and we are looking to it.   The position in Persia, Afghanistan, and
Iranscaspia is serious, but I do not look upon it as menacing, and I do not contem-plate, as General Smuts appeared to do yesterday, a condition of affairs when thewhole military effort of the Allies will Be sterilised in the West while a gigantictide of invasion will roll successfully towards the East. I think that was a some-what exaggerated view of the situation.Then as regards the conditions which he put forward and the policy which hesuggested.. His idea was that, regarding the military position in the West as held up and stabilised, we should endeavour to break up Austria in the Eastern parts ofEurope, which we have been steadily trying to do, and somehow or other direct theforces of Bulgaria against those of Turkey, even at the price of seeing Bulgaria in constantinople, ^ I confess that I was rather shocked at that part of his scheme,because if there is one nation in the East which has been more cruel and treacherousthan another in the war, it is Bulgaria. We could only give Constantinople toBulgaria at the expense of Serbia and Greece and our other allies in that part ofthe world, and it seems to me a prospect which we ought to regard, not only with no great satisfaction, but with very great alarm.Then, again, was General Smuts quite fair in his criticism of Mr. Balfour&apos;sspeech on war aims? After all, it is not for us here to lay down war aims in Europe.We cannot indulge in much more than war aspirations. It is almost academic tobe discussing at this moment in what way we want to carve out the future of these states the Czecho-Slovaks, the Yugo-Slavs, Poland, and so on. For my part Ihappen to disagree with the pronouncement made at Paris about Poland. I thinkit will be found impossible to secure a single and undivided Poland with access to the sea, and I do not believe our people would go on fighting for that if that were definitely laid down as a war aim which we must persist in fighting until we secure. I do not gather Mr. Balfour meant that. All I understood was this.He sketched out a Europe as he would like it to be if we were sufficientlyvictorious in the war to secure it. But it does not rest with us to do&apos; it. these things can only be done when we are at a conference table with our Allies; I donot mean necessarily the conference that follows the end of the war; it may be aconference while the war is going on. It seems to me not at all unlikely that you may get a state of affairs in which Germany will come forward with offers of rather-an attractive description, and then it may be that our Prime Ministers will be obligedto have a consultation with our allies to discuss them at a board. Then will be thetime to find out whether France is willing to renounce her claims in Alsace-Lorraine;what are the views of Greece, and how we can accommodate her claims with thosesay of Serbia. It will be for others to map them out. All we can do is to indicate ageneral view of the way in which we should like things to develop. Therefore, i submit the discussion of peace aims in Europe does not carry us far towards practicalresults at this moment.But take the discussion as it has covered a wider field. Here again weadvance from the extreme of certainty and that is a very small area to the otherextreme of the gravest doubt. The small area of certainty was that occupied byMr. Hughes yesterday when he said that whatever anybody else might do, he wasin possession of certain territories which he did not mean to let go.MR. HUGHES: It is better to be certain in a small sphere than flounderingabout in a big one.MR. CHAMBERLAIN: General Smuts takes that point of view about South-West Africa.LORD CURZON: Yes; I believe he does.We have this attitude taken by Mr. Hughes of &quot; J&apos;y suis, j&apos;y reste &quot; ; as regardsthe Pacific, we have General Smuts saying the same thing about South-West Africa,and we have Mr. Massey talking, quite rightly, about keeping Samoa. I hope they will persist in that attitude; if so, I think they will be victorious.Then there is a middle sphere, which is that occupied by, say, Mesopotamia.Is it Conceivable that the Peace Conference, or indeed anybody except an absolutelyvictorious Germany, will insist upon Mesopotamia going back to Turkey? It is outof the question, unless we experience a ruinous defeat that cannot be contemplated.Whatever the degree of victory, we may assume that nobody will want Mesopotamiato go back to Turkey. Then what is to become of it? Everybody agrees that theremust be an Arab State.&quot; We are the people who have evolved that idea. We are in good relations with King Hussein; we are building up the country; and we must be the trustees to whom it is given over.   There is no alternative.   I do not myself spend
five minutes in thinking about Mesopotamia, because I am convinced that there is-no country in the world capable of dealing with it but ourselves. I am not the leastdisturbed by the idea of our being accused of being capitalistic, monopolistic, orimperialistic.   No other solution is possible.Then we come to the other extreme of grave doubt, and that, unfortunately, is-the crux of the matter I refer to German East Africa. We cannot settle the fate ofGerman East Africa now.THE PRIME MINISTER: Do you propose to deal with Palestine?LORD CURZON: I accept the suggestion which was made the other day. but from what I know of the Americans I was surprised to hear our Ambassador speakas confidently as he did about the willingness of America to take over Palestine. Iwas talking only the day before yesterday to a man who is a friend of the Presidents,and in regard to whose influence with the President Lord Reading has privatelyborne testimony to me. I said: &quot; What is the view of President Wilson about this? &quot;He said: &quot; He has a great idea of international control, which fits in with his schemeof a League of Nations. He will join anywhere in regard to the policing of these territories, but do not be sure that he will be willing to administer them. He has theold traditional ideas of his party against assuming control and administering newterritories.&quot;THE PRIME MINISTER: It is no good unless he administers.LORD CURZON: You will find that difficulty; you will find a position inwhich President Wilson will say: &quot; I will join you or any other Powers in policing,,but I am reluctant to assume the whole administration.&quot; If he said to us in England:&quot; You must join in the administration,&quot; it is a position that I think we should be unwise to take up, for it is inconceivable that we should be allowed to join Americain administering Palestine without Prance and Italy. That would mean a Condo-minium, which is the worst of all solutions. Failing a British protectorate forPalestine, I am strongly in favour of pressing America to do&apos; it alone.Finally comes the case of German East Africa. I confess I look upon that with very, very grave alarm, because not only is there the question of the Black armyon which so much stress was laid, and the military resources which Germany would develop there, but there is the whole naval danger, the submarine danger, the docks,ports, and wireless telegraph danger, the aerodrome danger. You might find that ifyou let Germany return there she would sow on the African Continent seeds whichwould have a devastating influence in the whole world of the future. I do hope that whatever happens to that part of the world, whether we set up a Board or not,,we shall fight to the last against giving it back to Germany. If ever we do, we shallrue the day, because never again, if Germany returns into possession, would ourDominion forces be able to come from New Zealand and Australia to help us in.Europe; that would be out of the question. And the danger would not only be tous, but to all the nations who have sea-borne commerce in every part of the world.I do hope we shall fight to the last against giving back this territory to Germany.May I say another word; I am supposed to be an Imperialist. I do not knowwhether I am in every sense of the term, but I do rather regret, when I hear mycolleagues&apos; at this table almost wring their hands at the idea of anything being addedto the British Empire. I have spent my life in seeing these countries and contrastingtheir government with that of other nations. I say without any disparagement to america or anybody else: If you want to see a backward country fairly governed, on.the. whole, we do it better than anybody else. Why, therefore, should we sit downand say: &quot;Whatever we want, never let us contemplate finding the British UnionJack flying in new territories in the future; give them to France, or to any othernation, but for God&apos;s sake let us remain in the background.&quot; I do not take that view. My view is that the salvation of the dark places consists in having them under-British rule. It is rather unpopular to state this, and at a Peace Conference it may even be impossible to state it, but I deprecate the idea that when the time comes weare to sit still and take what President Wilson offers us. If he says: &quot; I cannot have-you British there,&quot; I am not prepared to say: &quot;All right, we are quite willing todisappear from the scene, you take our place.&quot; By all means let America come inwhere it is for the general convenience, but I am not anxious to set up all over theworld a new set of American dominions. That is merely my personal view. In anycase, I hope we shall stand up, whatever we do, for keeping German East Africa,from the Germans.
There is one other point: General Smuts seemed to be in favour, when nextGermany comes forward with peace proposals, of our discussing them, and even,provided they are fairly reasonable, conceding them. He spoke as if the great dangerof the future was an exhausted Europe; England being reduced to a second-ratePower, and America and Japan left in possession of the stage, with their resources,both in man-power and other respects, relatively untapped, and dominating the world.That is a prospect which might be very unfortunate for ourselves, but the otherprospect, which is much more serious, is that of a Germany left unexhausted. Itseems to me that if we were to follow his plan and enter into negotiations withGermany, she would be left absolutely in possession of the scene, for she would renew the struggle whenever she chose toi (do so,, with the whole world as at prejsentlaid at her feet, ourselves with insufficient resources to meet her or grapple with her,and with the victory not only in this war, but in future wars. Therefore, I come backto the point that, whether you call it militarism, or the military spirit of Germany, orthe military strength of Germany, you really have got to go on, whether it be forthree months,, or six months, or more, you have got to go on pursuing your present plan, and hammering away until you get Germany into a frame of mind very different from that which she is in at present. When we talk about militarism, wedo not mean reducing Germany to a prostrate condition, but we do mean bringingher to the frame of mind in which she will not refuse a peace which will be satisfactory to the rest of the world, a peace, moreover, which she will keep, and nothave the strength to break. The process will be a very difficult one, and at presentthe end may be far distant.MB-. BARNES: I heard General Smuts&apos; speech yesterday I must say with some little surprise, although, in certain respects, some of the things are similar to thosewhich have been simmering in my mind for some little time. He took a pessimisticview of the military situation, and, I rather thought, an unduly pessimistic view.I say that with some little doubt, because I am not a military man, and do not knowmuch about military affairs, but I read, only a few weeks ago, that comprehensivepaper by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, and I had in my mind the happen-ings of the last two or three weeks, which, I thought, had rather improved theposition rather than altered it for the worse. Therefore, I was somewhat surprisedto learn from General Smuts that the position from a military point of view wasnot so good as General Wilson seemed to think it was, and it occurs to me in that respect that the military experts ought to get together and ascertain, by expert advice, which is the correct view. It seems to me if General Wilson is right, then we ought to go hammering the Germans. - If, on the other hand, General Smuts is right,then it does seem to me that we ought to be reconsidering our position with a viewto applying our force to better advantage. Like Lord Curzon, I thought it was rather a weak point in General Smuts&apos; statement in regard to advising that we should go for knocking out Austria, or Bulgaria, or Turkey, or all three of them, because it occurred to me that, if we do that, we shall be weakening ourselves in the way ofafterwards dealing with Germany, and that we should leave Germany still strongfor another war. I think that, at all events, our chief consideration-and in this I agree with Lord Curzon ought to be to finish this war somehow or other withsuch a weakened Germany, and with such an altered Germany so far as the moral ofher people is concerned, that the world would be safe from another catastrophe suchas that which we have had during the last four years. I agree with General Smutsin his general statement about war aims, which, I think, have been far too ambitious.It is not a mere academic expression of what we wish, as Lord Curzon thinks.President Wilson and Mr. Asquith have both committed us up to the hilt aboutPoland, that Poland must be a united people with an outlet to the sea. PresidentWilson has expressed himself in that respect several times, and so has Mr. Asquith.I cannot recall the exact time, but I am almost sure that Mr. Asquith has said that,in his judgment, one of the considerations we ought to have in our mind ought to bea reconstituted Poland with an outlet to the sea. Therefore it is no mere academicexpression. We have been committed to these things, and these committals may haveeffect, for anything I know, upon the German mind. I agree with General Smutsthat we ought to be careful in not putting our claims too high. Poland may beentitled to a Government of its own with an outlet to the sea; the Slavs may be, andare, entitled to relief from long oppression; and, on the other hand, we must standby our bond; but I feel quite sure and I agree in this with General Smuts- that[543-8]C
our people are not going to fight on for those aims, and that one of these days war-weariness will count, and then we shall have to reconsider these things, and probably have to fall back. Take the secret treaties; that is another awkward factor in tilesituation. I am not saying a word against the Government for having made anagreement with Italy. Making the bargain with Italy and promising her theseDalmatian islands may have seemed the best thing to do at the time to shorten thewar and save life, because by that means we could more easily beat Germany.Unfortunately, the circumstances connected with the making of that treaty, and thedivulgence of that treaty afterwards by the Bolshevist Government; is a fact thatweighs very heavily upon the mind of our people, and it would be one of the bestthings that could happen to us. if we could get such a revision of our war aims as toget rid of that particular treaty.In regard to France, I believe there is such a feeling of comradeship between thepeople of this country and of France, that our people will be willing to fight along-side of France so long as France had any hope of being able to wrest her provincesfrom the Germans. All this, Prime Minister, leads up to what I think is one of themost important things, an Inter-Allied Conference of all the Powers on our side witha view to getting a revision of our terms a revision of our war aims, thereby getting the more whole-hearted support of all our people. It seems to me that the Powersmust recognise, the need for it, especially if they were met by others in the same spirit.Prime Minister, I am afraid we are not taking stock so closely as we ought to be doing of the spirit of our own people. Lord Curzon has just said that he believes that our people are as good as ever they were. On the whole, I believe they are sound;but still one ought to take stock of what is taking place both here and in France.Only a week or two ago there was a meeting of the French Socialists, following ameeting&apos; of the French trade unionists, and that section of the French Socialists that had been a minority up to that time led by Longuet, has now become a majority; theyhad 1,590 votes against 1,100 votes cast on the other side as a sort of mandate fromLonguet to refuse war credits to the French Government unless the French Govern-ment agreed to an International Conference between the democractic forces on our side and those on the side of the enemy. Then, in this country, the anti-war sectionsare getting an increased hold on our organisations. Take yesterday&apos;s newspaper;that is a sample of what is taking place. There was a meeting of delegates inLondon, and by 49 votes to 4 there again you had an expression of the anti-warsection in favour of peace by negotiation or something of that kind. ThenMr. Arthur Henderson has a very considerable following in this country, and apparently is making himself increasingly awkward. He is going to try to stampedethe Trade Unionist Congress, which is meeting next month at Derby, going there witha new grievance; that is to say, that you have prevented him from going to Switzer-land. I do not say you were not quite right in doing that, but, at the same time, all this shows me the need for doing something to counteract all that influence that isbeing applied in favour of an International Conference. It is getting a new startjust now in France, and also in this country, where Henderson has M. Huysmans athis elbow all the time. They are in touch with all the people in other countries, andit seems to me we ought to be doing something to torpedo that, and I think the best way of torpedoing it would be to have some Inter-Allied Conference, and lookingover the reports of last year&apos;s Imperial Cabinet, I find one of the committees was infavour of an Inter-Allied Conference at that time, and, as I gather, was supportedby the Imperial War Cabinet.LORD CURZON: I do not remember it.LORD MILNER: I do not either. There may have been some recommendation by the Economic Conference.MR. BARNES: I merely mention that incidentally, Prime Minister, as an.additional argument. It seems to me that you had it in your minds last year, but whether you had it in your minds last year or not, I think it is one of the things thatwe ought to have in our minds this year, because all these people are concentratingtheir efforts and focussing the anti-war feeling, and the anti-Government feeling, infavour of an International Conference, and I should like to spike their guns by having an Inter-Allied Conference. I should like to get Italy, and possibly others who are our Allies, to moderate their terms at such a conference.In regard to the German colonies, I agree absolutely with General Smuts. Ibelieve the proper thing there is that each of the nations already having territory in
that area should continue to administer those areas under some over seer ship, anInternational Board, or something of that kind, and I do not know why that Inter-national Board should not be the League of Nations.I am not sure that I agree with Lord Curzon in regard to Palestine and mesopotamia Mesopotamia, of course, is all right. I think there ought to be an arab State under the guardianship of the British people. I think I should be inclined to say the same in regard to Palestine. It is all very well to talk aboutPresident Wilson coming in and taking over Palestine. After all, President Wilsonhas done nothing to wrest Palestine from the Turks, and we have. I believe thesentiments of the people of this country would be rather in favour of keeping-Palestine direct under the British rule. There is a great deal of sentiment about the holy City in this country. I rather think, if we propose to hand over Palestine to america, with all due deference, agreeing as I do with bringing America in, andsharing the responsibilities for the custodianship of backward races, still, I think,there would be considerable opposition to Palestine being handed over to the americans after the sacrifices that have been made by us.I do not think I have much more to say, except to back up Mr. Hughes andothers in regard to the South Pacific. I think we are all agreed that there can beno Germans there if we come out of this war even as good as am^ of us may think.There can be no handing back the German colonies in the South Pacific, becauseif that were done the South Pacific would be no longer safe to live in. I think weare all agreed upon that. My chief point is that we ought to be making up our whole minds and preparing practical proposals to submit to our allies in the lightof existing facts. I am sorry to disagree with General Smuts about the military position in regard to which he is better able to judge than I am. It was rather a shock to me to hear yesterday that the position was so bad in his view, and Ithink his view and that of General Wilson ought to be very carefully compared tosee where we are.MR. CHAMBERLAIN: I cannot help thinking that in the survey of the war position which General Smuts gave us yesterday, he did not put quite the wholepicture before us, because he was thinking of the military situation more than anyother feature of it. My own feeling is that the exhaustion of Germany is verygreat indeed already, and that that exhaustion must increasingly affect her powerand her readiness to wage the&quot; war. It may be through these conditions, coupled with military failure, that we are nearer a good solution and a good victory than we are sometimes inclined to think. Whether that is so or not seems to me to depend, above all things, upon whether we succeed in I will not say restoring an Eastern Front but denying Russia to the Germans. If we deny Russian supplies to Germany I think the German power of resistance will not be as great as it mighthave been thought from the survey which General Smuts made yesterday. I do notthink, therefore, that we have to consider making a peace at any price by any means,or of making anything but a reasonable peace from our own point of view.As regards Europe, I agree with Lord Curzon, and I think the foreign secretary, if I rightly understood1, agreed with him also, that you cannot do morethan express certain aspirations. We know what would be an ideal solution, orthe bes,t solution possible, if we could deal with the matter in our own way. I want to say a word in regard to what Mr. Barnes has said. I think it may be necessary,and I think it has been recognised by our allies, probably quite as much as by our-selves, to revise some of the provisional undertakings which, we made with them atthe beginning of the war, which, as far as I know, were contingent on victory andon each of the Allies realising its own aspirations. That certainly was so in regardto the Syrian Agreement and the agreement dealing with that part of the countrybetween Russia, France, and ourselves.THE PRIME MINISTER: Do you remember the words we tried to put intothe Second Asia Minor Agreement in regard to the efforts made by each of theAllies lord ROBERT CECIL: As far as the Italians were concerned it never went through ultimately.THE PRIME MINISTER: We insisted on some such words.LORD ROBERT CECIL: I think we did, but the plan never went through;it was all subject to Russian consent, and we never obtained it.
MR. CHAMBERLAIN: The particular point which I wanted to lay stressupon was one which was mentioned by the Foreign Secretary, that whatever revisionthere might have to be of Italian aims, or of French aims, ought to start with theItalians or with the French. I think it would be fatal if we were to seek to revisetheir war aims at this stage. If the prospect of so defeating Germany as to carry through our full war aims disappear, the French and the Italians will recognise thatas soon as, or sooner than we do. They will be as little willing to go on fighting for anunattainable object as our people. But it would be fatal for our future in Europeif we produced an impression on France or Italy that, having brought Italy intothe war, having joined France in the war, and having come to certain terms withthem, we are now trying to back out at their expense. I believe we shall get the revision that is necessary, but I feel most strongly that the suggestion ought to comefrom them, in the first instance.As regards the British Empire, I do not know whether I am an Imperialist ornot.SIR ROBERT BORDEN: It depends upon the definition.MR. HUGHES: We ought to have a definition.MR. CHAMBERLAIN: I am not anxious to extend our British respon-sibilities, or to assume control, if it were not for other reasons necessary, of alarger part of the earth&apos;s surface, with the corresponding jealousy which thatcreates in other Powers. I think there is a certain danger in the great conquestswe have made this time, because we are absorbing more and more of the greattropical districts on which depend the industry and economic life of the world, andthe jealousy of us, if we control the whole of them, will, I think, be very dangerous inthe future. I do not, therefore, in the least desire to add to our obligations, and ifwe could have remained where we were, and devoted ourselves to developing all wehad, I should have asked for nothing better. But I think it is quite impossibleto contemplate the surrender to anyone, as any condition of peace, of either the SouthSea Islands or German South-West Africa. To surrender the one would be tooffend bitterly and deeply Australia and New Zealand, and to surrender the otherwould be, as I have heard General Smuts say, the beginning of the end of BritishSouth Africa.MR. HUGHES: I think it is -fair to say &quot;that the risk of offending Australiaought not to be considered for a moment; the question is that it would endanger us.New Guinea is only 80 miles away.MR. CHAMBERLAIN: I agree the Australians have good reason for sayingthat those islands ought to be retained as part of the British Empire, and I thinkit is impossible to contemplate their surrender.When you come to Palestine and German East Africa the question, to my mind, really resolves itself into one of security of the British Empire, and thesecurity of our present allies. The case for Mesopotamia seems to me one thatcannot be disputed by anybody who has studied the position of our Indian Empire the immediate danger in which that would be placed if the old German scheme ofthe Baghdad Railway could be revived and carried through to its conclusion withthe close association which now exists between the Central Empires and Turkey.German East Africa, it seems to me, is essentially not to be allowed to go backto Germany, because if you do you place her upon our great lines of communication and enable her to cut theni at any moment. I cannot help asking whether it is notpossible to prepare a reasoned statement of the case in this respect, which couldbe the basis of conversations with President Wilson or with our other allies-veryinformally in order that they may realise what &quot;the real danger is we have to. counter. I think it is very desirable they should not think we are out to graspwhat we can get, but that they should be brought to understand why we have to try to hold our own in these places.In the last resort I am quite ready to contemplate for parts of Tropical Africasuch a solution as has been proposed by General Smuts, but-1 do not think it is a desirable one if you can avoid it, and I think it will be very difficult to define therelative functions of the International Super-Board and the national administra-tion; but that problem might be studied. The one thing I would urge we shouldnot consent to anywhere is a Condominium. I am quite certain that as long as M.Clemenceau is Prime Minister of France that would meet with the bitterestopposition from him. He upset Gambetta&apos;s Government because Gambetta wasundertaking something like a Condominium in Egypt, and he did it as being the
9161friend of England, or as desirous of having good relations between the two countries,and because he said: &quot;Condominium leads first to friction and then to war.&quot; i hope, therefore, whatever else happens we shall avoid a Condominium, and if we decide to follow up General Smuts&apos; proposal, perhaps he would consider how farhe could work it out himself, with such a distinction of powers as will &quot;not in effectcreate a Condominium under the name of the national administration.I was very much interested with what Mr. Barnes said about Palestine. Itseems to me from many points of view that Palestine is of the least consequence tous of all our conquests, yet when he came to Palestine Mr. Barnes could not bear to part with it to anyone, even the friendly American, and almost contradicted inregard to Palestine all the principles that he had laid down in regard to the african colonies in general. I myself think it would be a good thing for the world ifAmerica, now that she has been brought into world politics, were kept there. Ithink it would be a particularly good thing for us if she had increased overseasresponsibility, bringing her increased knowledge; she would know better what theBritish Empire has done, and what its merits are, if she had to do some work ofthat kind herself, as she is beginning in the Philippines. I believe that palestine would be an ideal American protectorate. It is the only protectorate governed bya single nation that would be well viewed I almost said tolerated by any of theother allies with whom we are fighting the Russians, and the French certainlywould view with great jealousy an English protectorate there.MR. MASSEY: I do not think it matters about the Russians.LORD ROBERT CECIL: The Italians would welcome it.MR. CHAMBERLAIN: Yes, as excluding the French. I believe if you notmerely suggested that privately to him, but get about the idea that that really wasthe proper solution of the Palestine question, I believe you would get such an opinion in America as would make it easy for President Wilson to fall in with, and I shouldbe very glad to see a Palestine under American protection, interposed between egypt and the Powers further north.MR. MASSEY: What do you mean by &quot; protection &quot; ?THE PRIME MINISTER: Government by the United States of America.MR. CHAMBERLAIN: They would no doubt constitute a native administra-tion as much as they could, but it would be an American responsibility.LORD ROBERT CECIL: The problem of Palestine is perfectly prodigious.You have three races there who all hate each other bitterly, and you have to keeppeace between, the three. I am not arguing against the proposal, although I am not disposed to think it is the best, but it is a good one. I am told that the americans have recently made themselves very unpopular there, and that the only people whoare popular are the British.  That always happens. -MR. BARNES: I am not arguing against the proposal that it should be handedover to the Americans, but I think it would lead to opposition.THE PRIME MINISTER: Now let me say one word about the proposed inter-Allied Conference.MR. HUGHES: May I just interpose for one moment. Two things have been mentioned upon which I should like to say one word. I hope that what general smuts said in regard to German peace terms, and the probability of suggestions being put forward by them, and the possibility of our entertaining them favourably, willnot be the attitude of the Government. I think what Lord Curzon said is right, thatwe have got to go on hammering away at them for a long time until they get into theframe of mind when they will entertain the.kind of peace terms we want. It hasbeen suggested that there should be a, conference of the Allies on war aims. I thinkthat would be a very great mistake. These are war ambitions rather than war aims,although I am bound to say that, if you were to judge the tone of the debate from my rather unfortunate observation that &quot; we intend to hold on to what we have got,&quot;evidently that does hot apply to other things to the Italian and Balkan situations,to Alsace, and to Palestine. So that I think to discuss now with President Wilsonthe question of these war aims would be to embarrass us lhost seriously.[54.3-8]D
MR. BARNES: On the other hand, you do not mind dealing with the presentembarrassment of Poland.THE PRIME MINISTER: I do not propose to cover the whole ground, butthere are one or two observations I should like to make about certain things whichhave cropped up in the discussion, and the first thing 1 should like to allude to isthe proposal put forward by Mr. Barnes that there should be an Inter-Allied Con-ference to discuss war aims. I do not know what could be achieved by a conferenceof that kind, which would serve the purpose which Mr. Barnes has in mind. Heseems to think that it would have the effect of moderating the aims of the Allies, and present such a series of demands as would appeal to the democracy of these and othercountries. I think it would have exactly the opposite effect myself. About sixmonths ago, President Wilson: and the British Government submitted to the worlda series of war aims of the most moderate character. If we had summoned an Inter-national Conference to consider them, you would never have, had those aimsrecognised, because&apos;, what happens at this sort of conference! Each Power insistsupon its own maximum demands, not because it intends to stick to those demandswhen it comes to the Peace Conference, but because it knows perfectly well from a bargaining point of view that, unless it does so the modified aims will become themaximum aims by the time you come to the Peace Conference. From the bargainingpoint of view, Baron Sonnino, who happens to be of Scotch extraction, and knowshow to drive a bargain pretty well, is perfectly right. He says: &quot; I will give up some-thing, providing France does the same thing, and England gives up something, but ifI am the only one who is to give up anything, then I go to the Peace Conferencehaving surrendered everything, and have nothing to bargain with.&quot; An Inter-AlliedPeace Conference, so far from having the effect of moderating the war aims of theAllies, in my opinion, would have the effect of considerably departing in the directionof increasing the demands which, on the whole, have been accepted by the programmeof January last. We had an Inter-Allied Conference here, I think it was in Februaryor March of 1917. What was the result? We answered Germany by demandingpractically everything on the face of the globe. All the most extreme demands thatfiad ever been put forward by any belligerent were incorporated in that document.I am afraid an Inter-Allied Conference would have the very worst effect from thepoint of view of moderating our war aims.The other observation I should like to make is this, that, whatever happensbefore we make peace, I think it is essential that Germany should be beaten. Ithink that matters more than the actual terms of peace.MR. HUGHES: That is quite right.THE PRIME MINISTER: Because, what is the position? Germany hascommitted a very great crime against humanity, and you want to make it impossiblefor any nation to be tempted to repeat that offence, and the first thing you have to,do is to show that any nation which attempts that will combine such forces in other nations against them as to make it impossible for them to succeed. When you cometo impose terms upon that country, I think they must be terms which will be tanta-mount to a penalty for the offence. You have, I think, to deal with nations asi withindividuals in that respect. You must say to a nation which offends: Your punish-ment is assured; you will not succeed; and your punishment will be a severe one; andwhen any nation gets tempted in future to attempt an operation of the same kind,their statesmen will say: Well, see what happened to Germany when they attemptedthe same thing 20, Or 50, or 100 years ago.Now I should like to apply that to the consideration of the German colonies.I think the first thing that matters is that they should not go back to Germany, not because Germany has not exploited them properly, and treated the natives badly,although that is an element which we cannot forget, indeed, there is a bigger case there than we have thought worth while to make.MR. BALFOUR: It has been made a little.   &apos;THE PRIME MINISTER: I think it ought to be made a great deal more.We have all heard the stories of how badly they have treated the natives. That is nota thing we ought to forget, but that is not the main reason. The main reason is, weshould say to Germany: There you are, you have plunged the world into this horror,and you have got to be properly punished, and you must be stripped of all yourEmpire in the future.   You will not be trustees of either black or white until you
have learned something of the arts of civilisation, and how to behave decently in thesociety of nations. That is the first thing you have to do, and until you do- it you have to be deprived of the Empire either of black, white, or yellow. I am sure thatis the first thing we ought to consider. Now, having come to that conclusion, the nextis: What are you to do with the German colonies? Well, I do not know that we needticket ourselves as Imperialists or otherwise; I think it is a good thing for.thesecountries that Great Britain has undertaken their development. I also agree with lord Curzon that Great Britain has done very much better than any other country could have done. But I think what matters is that these countries should be developed, and there&quot; is a limit to what we can do., I have been in the House ofCommons for thirty years, and I have seen bow this has been done. First of all, yousay you must have money for a railway in Uganda; that takes five or ten years. Thencomes Nigeria. We had once a very powerful Colonial Secretary, who was a very powerful personality, and who had a very dominant influence in his Government.He was able to do in the course of years very much more than an average Colonial-Secretary would if he had been there fifty years.LORD MILNER: It was the only time anything was done.THE PRIME MINISTER: You cannot reckon on that; that was a very exceptional case. That one of his exceptional standing power could hold that office at all was exceptional. Therefore we must not reckon on that particular time ofdevelopment; if he had been an average Colonial Secretary it would have meant a railway in about ten years. If we grab all these countries it will simply mean that itwill not be done, and I think it is not merely in the interests of those countries wemust not forget that the first consideration is those countries themselves and thepeople who dwell in them but it is in the interests of the British Empire as well that somebody should develop these lands, so long as there are conditions imposedthat will not confine the benefit exclusively to the country that develops them. There-fore, I would bring America in definitely, not to reward America, not to attractAmerica, although that is not to be overlooked, but you want to commit Americadefinitely to the policy of white nations helping to develop these backward countries.I was very much impressed with Sir Robert Borden&apos;s suggestions on those lines.America is enormously wealthy, she is very enterprising, and there is no doubt, say,if East Africa were handed over to America, America would do far more for EastAfrica in twenty years than we could do in 200.  Why?MR. HUGHES: I think you are wrong.THE PRIME MINISTER: Let me give the reasons. First of all, for the simple reason that the British Empire has got millions and millions of square miles,and it is just as much as we can do to develop them take India, for instance. Thereare millions of square miles in Africa which we cannot develop for probably a century, and if, in addition to that, we are going to add East Africa, Togoland, the cameroons, and all these other countries, we shall simply have to let some of themwait. If we have German East Africa and begin to develop it, Uganda will suffer;and Nigeria will suffer. Therefore, from the point of view of first of all committingAmerica to the policy of development, by the white races of these backward countries,and in the second place because that is the quickest way by which these countries can be developed, I should have thought it was desirable that some of these greattracts of territory should be handed over to the trusteeship of America.MR. MASSEY: You are not speaking of German South-West Africa?THE PRIME MINISTER: Well, that is so essential a part of that country,that I do not see how the Cape, for instance, could possibly allow it to be handedover, and the same thing applies to the islands of the Pacific. I agree in everything that has been said about the islands of the Pacific, but I am thinking rather ofthose great African tracts which will either have to be handed over to GreatBritain or to an International Board or to America. I agree with everything thathas been said by Lord Curzon and Mr. Chamberlain that, to admit anything in thenature of a Condominium, would be fatal.MR. HUGHES: You put America there by herself?THE PRIME MINISTER: As trustee for those territories. I would saydefinitely to her &quot; Will you undertake the guardianship of this territory ? &quot;   If you[543-8]E
said: &quot;Will you administer this territory?&quot; they would probably say &quot;No,&quot; butif you said: &quot; Will you take the trusteeship of the people who are here?&quot; shewill spend money, she will develop the country and do her best for the natives ofthe land. Therefore, I entirely agree with Sir Robert Borden. Whether, in additionto that, you can give Palestine- MR. HUGHES: If she refuses you fall back.on. ourselves, do you?THE PRIME MINISTER: I think we must. We could not give it to Germany.I am. dead against any international control. I think you must undertake it. thoughthat would be a misfortune for us as well as the country itself.. The last thing to which I wish to refer is about the military position. I do not take General. Smuts&apos; view about the military situation. If he confines it to 1919 hemay be right; I would not say we can overthrow the German military: power in1919, but I do not take his view7 that you cannot carry on further. I am sure you can if there isi progress made. I am not alarmed about the Socialist Conference.These conferences do not represent the vast majority of the workmen as&apos;a rule. i know how they are elected in this country, and so does Mr. Barnes. In SouthWales, it simply means that there are 10,000 miners in a district; 50 of them go toa public-house and elect the representatives of the whole 10,000. These men do not represent the workmen in any of these areas, and if you put it to the workmen: &quot; Areyou going to make up your minds to beat the Germans ? &quot; they will tell you that is what they are out for. The workmen of this country have made up their minds tobeat the Germans. That is what is in their minds. If reasonable progress hasbeen made they would be perfectly willing to go on. Every time I have hearddiscussions and I have heard them now for four years about peace, I have heardtfeis sort of thing: &quot; Now do you think France will stand another winter ? &quot; I have heard that in 1915, in 1916, and in 1917. Everybody agrees that France is muchmore prepared to go through the winter in 1918 than they ever thought she was in1916 or 1917, and she will go through the winter of 1919 as well if she sees a reason-able prospect of beating her hereditary and very bitter foe.MR. MASSEY: Have you seen the telegram from America to Mr. Barclaywith regard to peace terms?THE PRIME MINISTER: Yes, I saw that. We know our own difficulties,and we are beginning to realise what are the difficulties of the enemy, which arevery great. They have been able to draw upon their man-power to a much greater extent than ourselves, because they have&apos; had two millions of Russian prisoners.They are able, too, to draw labour from Russia, but all that is bleeding them whiterand whiter. It may enable them to prolong the war for an additional year or two,but everyone knows that this is a very fatal thing for Germany that they should been abled to do it by such means, because they are forced to put all their vigorousyoung men into the trenches.Then Austria, I think, is in a very rickety condition; the same thing appliesf to Turkey.   The economic conditions, are bad; their harvests are very bad; and atime will come when this will react on their armies, and then, I think, will be thetime when we can probably overwhelm them. There will be a good deal of fightingnext year. I do not think we shall break through, but we shall wear them down agood deal, and by the .following year I think it is quite within the limits of achieve-ment that we should be able to beat the Germans and inflict upon them a defeatwhich they themselves will recognise to be a defeat and that is what is important.Then the Eastern front. Mr. Chamberlain said it would be quite enough ifthey could be deprived of the resources of Russia. I think we ought to get morethan that. I think Russia has got to be deliberately reconstituted, not as a force,but as a menace.MR. MASSEY: A united Russia.THE PRIME MINISTER: Even if it is not united so long as it will forcethem to keep men there, either to abandon Russian territory or to keep large armiesthere, that is a thing they cannot do for a couple of years and at the same timekeep reserves on the West which will enable them to stand the constant pressure of armies which are increasing month by month. They cannot do it, and that is why I do not take General Smuts&apos; view. I think it is entirely a question of ourkeeping up the pressure. We may have difficulties with public opinion. Publicopinion now is all right; but it will go down again.   Then you have to bring it up.
I believe that by a real effort to sustain the spirit of the public we should be able tokeep them going for two or three years, and that is the thing that matters. If youdo that, I believe you will inflict upon them such a defeat as will enable you to dictate terms, and the terms that should,be dictated ought, in my judgment, to be such as will mark the view which humanity takes of the heinousness of the offencecommitted by Germany. That is the only basis of any League of Nations. TheLeague of Nations will start here. You will say: Now this is the thing that willhappen to any nation which repeats this offence in future. Unless you are ableto do that this war is not won.ME. HUGHES: I would like to address myself to a point Mr. Balfour made,which had great force the condition of Russia and these smaller nations whichhave been cut up and are to depend upon Germany. Is there anything we can dowhich will prevent them becoming her vassals?THE PRIME MINISTER: Russia will be recreated, and a recreated russia will federate these states with herself. I agree with the Foreign Secretary&apos;s views as to this, but the one I am doubtful of is Poland. He has been much more sanguineas to the possibilities there than I am. I am very much afraid that, with regard to poland, you could not draw the line between aspirations and war aims. I do. notbelieve you can, because each of these nations thinks naturally about its own branchof the business, and they say: Here these Powers have given a particlar pledge; they regard it as a pledge, and yet Poland has been sold so often. She was sold byNapoleon, who talked very much the same as we are apt to talk to her. I am verymuch afraid of the same thing happening here. The United States of America hasbeen keen about that. There are millions of Poles there, with consequently a verylarge number of votes, and I do not think this was in their point of view a great waraim so much as it was a great electioneering aim. I am afraid that if we cannotachieve that in the end, Poland will say: Here we have been sold again. If we defeatGermany completely, it is quite within the realms of possibility that you can achieveyour aim, and in that case Poland, as a Buffer State, will be very useful.MR. MASSEY: Before the proposal with regard to Palestine goes further, andas we may not have another opportunity of expressing an opinion upon it again, Iwould ask you to consider the effect on the Mohammedan population of the Empireof handing over Palestine to the United States as they are intensely concerned.MR. MONTAGU: I would like to make the same observation. The americans have no experience or knowledge, so far as I know, of handling Mohammedan ques-tions; and I should not have thought the ideals which they have with regard to palestine would be very agreeable to the Mohammedan population.THE PRIME MINISTER: The alternative is to give her great slices of africa.LORD READING: I should have doubt if they would accept the proposal to administer East Africa. -THE PRIME MINISTER: They have millions of negroes, you know.LORD READING: They are nervous of being drawn in.SIR ROBERT BORDEN: If they could be convinced that it was practical to ship all their, negroes to East Africa they would agree.THE PRIME MINISTER: They have been very glad to get their labour.SIR ROBERT BORDEN: They have been a great trouble.MR. BALFOUR: I do not admit that the sort of sketch I made is really athing Germany would not, in the last resort, accept. If all my war aims were carriedout Germany would still remain the biggest military Power in Europe by far she has over 60 millions and with an increasing population, in addition to- the Austrians.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,August 16, 1918.
