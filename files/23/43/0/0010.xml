c 2 o i AMR. CHUKOHILLj     I will first state the soope of theMinistry of Ivlunitione,     It provides everything required hythe ftar Office and also everything that is - required by theAir Ministry * ......TU&amp; PKXMB MIMSSEls     Do you design for the Air Ministry fMB* OHOBCHILL;     Yes* -   We eolleot and manufacture almost all the. raw materials -and a large portion of the semi-preparedmaterials for the Admiralty,    We make all shipbuilding -material*So do not manufacture for the Admiralty in the building of theships or in the manufacture of their monitions,      S?hey have aseparate establishment which is about one-fifth the- aim of theMinistry of  -fonltions, - from whieh they supply themselves, andof course as the Cabinet will readily suppose, whatever advantages that gives from a departmental point of view it leads to greatduplication of staff, divergence of policy in regard to labourand in financial matters, difficulties in regard to a uniformpolicy for contracts, and considerable friction, but it has notyet been found possible to get over those difficulties, though am bound to mention- them, and in solving them lias one ofthe only remaining great economies - in - men and money that canbe made aMMm HGSHiSSs     Are the two difficulties in the two classesof machines fundamental t-MR, QHURGHIIdi:     Hot at all? the - difficulty lies - in there-being two establishments, aa it were, competing sometimes in themxm workshop and in the same class of material, of labour movingfrom one set of conditions when they arc making Admiralty shellsto-another set of conditions when they are making Army shells- SIR HOBSlff BOKQBAi     33o they compete in the purchase ofraw materials ?12R, GR0KOHIL1s     Yes, to - a certain extent but It is afertile source of waste; still there are great difficulties In response moving itsHE, bonar LAWs     I believe a great deal .of competition sincethe

in.. tlie beginning has been got over.MR. OHUEGHlMij     A good deal hasj we have boon doing our very,bast, but a simplified arrangement would be to have three fightingServices, a universal Wax Labour Supply Department at the Ministryof national Service, and a universal Supply Department dealingwith materials        X toresay perhaps when the war is over weshall get some organisation of that kinds,The foundation of the munitions programme is, of course, labour. and tonnage9-    1 do not mention finance because finance- is nota limiting factor*     I do not mean it is not a factor which isnot very carefully -considered, but we axe held up before wereach the limits of money by the supply of materials.        $he-supply of materials, the amount of tonnage, the supply of skilled labour, and the competition fox the materials between the Departmentsfox priority and so foxth, really produce a scrutiny of projects fromthe point of view of economy which is fax more important, accordingto my experiences than the financial control operative beforethe wax.    At any rate the Chancellor of the exchequer^ lineis no longer a gold line, but it is a steel line, and a materialline, and a tonnage line,    0 fax as labour is concerned in allthe munition industries of the country, taking the widest? view and including the Admiralty, there axe 3,400,000 persons ofwhom. 080,000 are woman.     In the munition industries proper youmight say there were two and three quarter million persona ofewhom three quarters of a million were women?   There are -5,1300controlled firms under the Ministry of Munitions,&apos;     It is an enormous field of labour *      Watching this very closely anaconstantly I am muoh sat ruck by the fact that the main motiveIs political rather than social or economical,,        I mean thatthis great body of labour becomes restless, if it, fox themoment, loses its.conviction of the neoesaity of the war, oxif it thinks that the wax is being needlessly prolongsa, or ifit thinks that the war is not making, any progress or is notbeing

being rigorously pursued.     Of course all those tendenciesoome tip when the operations at the front are practicallyquiescent or stagnant, hut the moment any misfortune occursthe whole&apos;of this great body rallies with the greatestspontaneity and reveals the deep feelings of devotion andpatriotism which animate them all, or practically all*   It isa Very remarkable fact that in this year that I have occupiedthe office of Sinister of Lamitions almost to a day, we havehad a good many strikes which hare been very provoking,hut taking the whole thing together, we have lost fewer daystoy mm striking in the whale year, than the workers havegiven us hack voluntarily in working during their Easterholidays after the disaster of March, in fact there are one million days8 working -credit according to a calculation whichI have lately received on the total time schedule of a -yeasts work?        It is a marvellous record and people whohear ah out a strike hero and there vexy often do not realisewhat a - tiny part it is in our gigantic scheme of production,Meantime m have boon doing&apos;our best to release man for service in the Army by processes of substitution and dilutionwhich.are constantly at work, and which touch the very rootsof the most ohairished ofejects of trade unions,, and very good?esuits have been obtained in this direction.     We havereleased since May last 170,000 men for the Army.     Up to thepresent time this year v/e have released 120,000 men, and nearly all of those have gone since the 21st .iareh*    We release from seven to nine thousand men a week,ME, HUGHESt     Are they mostly mechanics or labourers-fMB* OHXJEOHILLg Zhey are skilled man.ME * HuGlXftSi Artisans ?MB. OIFuHCHILL: skilled artisans in most oases *     All ofthem had been subject to scrutiny before,     We have actuallyreleased mere then 16f* of the total number of men of militaryego whom mt have on Government woaric, and I think you willreadily

oat   H . *aitsreadily understand that it is a very difficult thing togo on Handing away these men and yet at the same time to meet and (substitution in introducing women and simplifying processesfor training men to replace those who have gone away, and intraining new elements from the Peace industries into the WarIndustrie0O     But. I think it is only right to say that we hawsvery nearly reached the limit; we run the risk of making anothergreat mistake if we overstrain our resources of sclentiflapro$notion, hut 1 will refer to this point again, later on.$he.other foundation on which we build is tonnage*     In1917 we got approximately 1,000,000 tens a month for monitionpurposes?MR? momsi tonnage for material ?MU OHUEOSILLj   Yes?    Tonnage to carry material for making munitions of war?    That is in round figures?   Last yearwe had great stringency on shipping,   -We had fierce discussions as to what should be done, and-I was directed, after longconsultation, to cut down to ten million tone instead of twelve,     $hat is a 2Q$ cut.     I thought myself at the time thatthe Shipping Goatroller&quot;s estimate was not only a conservative estimate but if I may say so a Scotch conservative estimate, andthat in fact he would be better than his word, and so he was?He has carried during the months of this year almost what weoriginally asked for and&apos; almost what&apos; we had. in 1.917? We have got about 960,000 tons a month this year as against 830,000which was all that we were told we should get?     Luckily, we did not consider ourselves absolutely&apos;limited by the tonnage thatwas promised us, and an&apos; order came from the- Cabinet that mwere to order in excess of our allocation?-    We have consequentlylarge quantities at the ports ready to come- forward, and owing to the&apos;shipping situation being better than was expected, we have succeeded in lifting this, very large amount?the demands for a still larger output?It is a hugeproposition0Wo have been very successful in dilution

liSI propose to budget for next year on the basisof 1,000,000 tons a month.    It is what we had in 1917which la what we were hoping to get this year, and Ithink that will be a very good basis for us to takenext year.   Of this totel volume of imports, two-thirdsare made -up of steel and explosives or with materials for making explosives.     Two-thirds of the whole ofthis,  either ore in some form or another from Spainor Her way, is used to make steel or shell steel, or else it is some form of nitrates or explosives.H&apos;e make, from all the sources that- we- can draw fromat the present time in this country, 30$ more steel-&apos; than we were making before the war.    It is/veryremarkable fact showing how this industry has grown.MR. HUGHES;   Made for commercial purposesbefore the War *r?.&apos;H, C HUH CHILL:   Yes, made for everything.   the steel output of this country has advanced 30$ on what it was before the War,    in regard to electrical energy,-when war broke out we had reached, a certain standardwhich was the result of 30 years * development, andthis we have multiplied by 2$, times in the -war- period.MR. HUGHES:     Have you the cost per unit ?MR. CHURCHILL:      All prices now are greatly influenced by war conditions.     A great many branchesof our production have&quot;been much cheapened.     Wehsve

lithave only just held our pre-war peeltion in regardto Home Ore which is what- it was in 1913, &quot;but ofcourse it has been held in face of continual takingaway of men.My steel Budget for this year will be       Iwork on a November to November basis, which beginsafter a big offensive each time *- will approximateto 8 million tons.       Of that the Admiralty have about  -! million tons, fox- shipbuilding and other-materials.    There was a time,  about 8 or. 9 months ago,, when their shipbuilding was believed to be limited by the amount of shipbuilding material we provided,but we have got over all that and they have now gotmore than/they can handle and are actually storingup.-    The Admiralty are the biggest consumers ofsteel.   The next great demand on the steel budget is for shell. About 2 million tons of steelfor shell is required in a year -      The War Office,including railways,  require about 1 million tons;munitions,  including the Air, the guns,  and the tanks and so&apos; forth require another million, and then theCivil needs of the country and all other miscellaneousdemands require lg millions, making the total of millions.       We throw a good deal more shell on theenemy than the whole civilian needs of the countryactually require. How I pass /from

m   3-   *from the material is to the ordnance&apos; group*&quot;-MR. CHAMBSRLAIK: Before you leave the at eel, do youhappen to know how much of the steel that you turn out is supplied for the use of the Allies&quot;MRv GHUBCHILL:   Yes, 362,0-00 tens, which is a small,portion of the 8 million tons.I-sat working down from the foundation of tonnage andlabour, and through steel, and coming to what we make out ofsteel.   First of all,  shell;   now the batteries which fireden the Sesame in 1916 hurled 25*000 tens a week upon the enemy in that great offensive; that was an unprecedented; and anunparalleled development of artillery.      Last year weprovided for a 38 weeks5 offensive&quot;46,000 tone a week, andthis year I prepared for a 38 weeks&apos; offensive, or battleperiod,- on-a basis of 81,000 tone a week.   Since the 21st-March, a period of 14 or 15 weeks, ire have got rid ef only34,000:tons a week, leaving us 16 or 17 thousand tons a week in hand,   1 propose to budget next year on the &quot;basis of 45,000tons a week which will harmonise with 1 million tons ef ship^ping a -month, and 1 propose to sad to this 48,000 tons a weekall that we can keep in hand between what we actually fire and &apos;the 51,000 tons which we have provided for this year;   thatwill probably bring next year up to SO,000 or 55,000 tons aweek,   Of course one can always slew down-if it appears&apos;later on te he&apos; necessary.THE 1%1-MB Mill STEM.   What are we actually firing now mr.. CKUROHILLs   34, 000 tens a weak since the 21st March,making 16,000 or 17,000 tens a-week oredit.This brings me immediately to the Question of guns, - itis obvious that we have reached the limits of - the weight ef shell.We are not going to win the war by piling up larger masses ofshell, or by hurling greater masses of shell. If you go on the basis . of

- 9&quot; -119of 45, 000 or 55, 000 tons a week next year that will he enough.You will not huve sufficient gunners and you will not have thefacilities to heave more.&apos;   So that if you cannot increase the weight of material that you hurl at the enemy, the&apos; only greatfield in which we can move is to hurl it further       to throw thesame&apos; weight further.   An increase of range in artillery is reallyequivalent in many&apos;aspects to an increase in the number efguns without however demanding more personnel, because gunshave a wider axe, and consequently much more powerful eoneen**tratione can he rapidly brought to hear on this or- that portion&quot;of the front and one gun can watch a bigger front.        Theincrease of range is vitally Important because if you are to. attack you want to be able to support your troops in the attacknot only in the first line but also in the second line with your heavy and concentrated fire without the necessity of moving, the guns very far forward, or, indeed, - moving them atall.   On the other hand, in defence of course it is enormouslyadvantageous to have an increase of range &quot;because you can keepyour guns away from the immediate danger of capture.   So i thought that the great new task we should undertake was an effort to increase generally the range of our artillery for next year.The field gun range really depends upon the shape of the trail.The trail of eur present gun is like a pole and does, not allow the breach of the gun to he sunk more than a certain amount and unless you can cock a gun up at a&apos; steep angle you &apos;cannot getthe range, therefore we have had for a long time under design,and upon which agreement has been finally reached by all parties concerned, a new gun for the field artillery,    it Is a wonderfulgun.    It has the same barrel or tube as the present gun butit has a box trail which gives 30 degrees elevation;     it firesfaster than the French 75,    It fires an 18 -pr shell as againsta 14-pr shell;    it is absolutely stable.      1 saw this gunfired three weeks ago -and they put a card up 50 yards away.   Thegun

gun fired ten rounds and all ten shots passed through the semehole, although the gun- was $wallowing its own recoil each time.There are many other features, one of which is that the gunweighs ho more.than the existing gun.   By May of next year we hope that the British artillery, will then .-have. 3,500 field guns,   and of those we hope that nearly 3,000 will he these newguns,  and the other 1,500 will he guns whioh have air recuperatorsThus the range of the British Field Artillery will he raised from6,000 to 10,400 yards.   It is a terrific achievement if it can be  done8- Another method of increasing the range of the heavy and medium guns is to have more tubes than hitherto for the gunswith the longest range.   The tubes wear out much mom quicklythan the carriages and the same lot-of carriages and gunnerscan fire mere ammunition and use up more tubes for the 6W longrange gun      nearly three times as many ,  if they can be provided.Another direction in which we are working is in regard &apos;to- the stream line shell *   In this connection the French have gone some distance and the Germans have gone a very considerable distance.   You put a long false hose -on- the-shell and give itincreased facility of travel through the air, the differencevarying according to different shells from perhaps 500 to 1200yards, and I hope to provide next year a proportion of ammunitionsuited to each gun.It might interest the Imperial War Cabinet to mention in passing two freak types of ordnance which we are making, oneof which is a very long range gun which will shoot 75 miles.This is &quot;being made very quickly &quot;by -taking a 16* gun and liningit up to 8 inches and it is hoped that useful places will befound, next year behind the French front where it can fire on german towns.-ME, BOKAR LAW;   1 suppose the life of this gun is very short ?MR, CHURCHILL:    It will fire 150 rounds, then you mustre-line.

The other monstrous weapon is the 18&quot; howitzer,frhis was asked for by the Array and we are making half-a-do senas early as possible.     They will be in action by the. Spring.It is m beautiful weapon $4 feet long.-    It throws a ton about24,000 yards? but the point is that it throws it with extremeprecision-      It would almost hit this room at 24,000 yards distanceIt would break e bridge for instance with almost complete certaintyin a few shots, or a canal lock, or anything of that kind, andthat is why they wanted to have a weapon of this kind which shotwith accuracy and which, at the same time, will not wear outsoon.     This&apos; gun will go on firing away almost indefinitely with-out any marked erosion..In regard, to guns you must remember that by guns I meanguns and. carriages - the whole thing complete - which is acomplicated apparatus.     We have a great many more tubes readythan carriages, the tubes are in advance of the carriages.     Thecarriages are the limiting factor and we always have difficultyin getting complete concurrence in this class of production.At the time of the late emergency in March we were in a very satisfactory position as regards gun equipments because not onlywere the 1,200 gun equipments which we had lost, replaced,.but thebatteries of the British Amy now have 260 more guns in theirregular establishment than on 21st. March.MR. rnjOinSB:    Of at least equal calibre?ICR. CHURCH III.:    The increase is rather on the heavy side.The Prime Minister asked me the other day what we had got readyif a new emergency occurred.     There are in France and at homeat the present time, apart from the weapons Which are being used by the troops, about 1,300 guns which are immediately ready.    Theoutput for the next two or three months will be very large.   Intoaddition/providing for our own Army we have promised the Americans280 heavy guns of which we have supplied 64 up to the 1st June and mm looking around to see in what way we can.add to that- number, be-cauee they will be completely dependent upon the British and Frenchfor

for their artillery during I91B.MR. MASSJ8Y:    Have they no heavy guns of their own?MR, CHURCHILL:    Hardly any.     The total number of gunswhich we have made in the last 12 months was 9*335*     Theestimated output in nsw guns in the next 12 months includingthe six-pounder guns for the tanks. Is 23,000.     This mootstriking example of the expansion of the British gun output isdue to the great factories which were put up by the Prime minister when the Ministry of Munitions was founded.     In- the 12 monthswhich ended on the 31st July, 191*5, the total number of newguns and repaired guns which were inspected and issued to theBritish Army was 239*     I?or the week ending 15th June last thetotal number was 4?6, or double as much, practically, in aweek as had previously &quot;been produced in a year.     That is anincrease of 10,000$.     So much for guns..SIR ROBERT BORBKK:    Is the British Army in Franee fullysupplied with all the artillery that it needs?MR. CHURCHILL:    It is fully supplied with everything, inaddition to the 1,300 guns in reserve.T.H1 PRIHS UIHI.STBR:    It is gunners we stand In need of.We discussed this very question yesterday to see if we eouldnot get some American gunners.MR. CHURCHILL:   Jfow I come to the question of rifles. -These were the great factor of delay at the beginning of thewar, but they raise no problems now.     Our weekly output is about24,000 and 6,000 repaired and we have a total reserve of260,000 plus probably 1,000,000 of what I call non-servicetypes which&apos;are quite all right but which are not the typeusually used In the field.MR. HU0HB3:    Will they take service ammunition?MR. CHURCHILL:       Yes.      In addition to that it came to my notice that there had been accumulated in Americaat our expense an enormous number of Russian rifles, part ofthem

them belonging to the United States and part to ue.     Therewere no lees than 5B0,0QQ which &quot;belonged to America ,end therewere 370,000 whioh belonged to us.     I brought the 370,000 over here and found them in very bad order.     X am having them oiledtoand put in/order.      I have also 750,000,000 rounds of smallarm ammunition to fit these rifles and the Americans haveanother store over there.     1 wanted to have them over here inorder to have something to fall back upon in case of an invasionor anything of that kind, brides which I have always had inmind the possibility of Intervention in Russia, in which case we should have these two lots of rifles to draw upon from bothsides.MR. HUGHES:    Are these rifles ready now ?MR. CHURCHILL:    Yes,  if you want 100,000 you can havethem in a month with almost limitless ammunition.MR. MA8S8Y:    Have they been used ?MR, CHURCHILL:    No, they are brand new Russian rifles.In regard to machine-guns there are three kinds - VickereLewis and Hotehkiee,     We had in existence when we went to waronly 1,100 in the British Army.   Last week we had rather a badweek and we made 2,750,     This year we are expecting to make140,000.     When you think of the scale on which machine guns arerequired, the enormous number, it is evident that any question of introducing a new type has got to be considered with the utmost possible care,     People take a fancy to this or that invention,but they forget that there are no means fer making the &quot;outputon this gigantic&apos; scale unless you stiek to the same patternand develop the repetition process.     It takes anything froma year to 18 months to start production on a large scale of anew type.     We have decided that the policy of the War Officeand the Ministry of Munitions is not to make a new light machine gun but to stifck to our existing patterns of machine-guns,and when we do make an advance/to ii :

to go to an automatic rifle which a soldier can carry andhandle himself.     We have adopted an automatic rifle which hasbeen agreed upon, and we are making every effort to put it into production and make 100,000 as quickly as possible.     I canguarantee no effectual deliveries for 15 months more at least.You see how difficult it is to put these things into operation.MB. HUGHES;    &quot;$hot is the number of rounds the automaticrifle which you have in mind can fire per minute ?MB. CHURCHILL:    They will fire a continual stream ofshots without taking your finger off the trigger;     you caneither press the trigger each time or hold it down, and in thelatter case the gun continues to discharge.MR. HUGHES:    By what device can you cool the barrel ?MR. CHURCHILL:    By not firing; more than enables you toget this burst of fire.     It gives this tremendous power offiring without taking the rifle from the shoulder      usingit like a hose pipe       and with high-class men it would play a very Valuable part, hut in the hands of men who were nothighly trained it would simply mean that you would fire off ina few minutes more ammunition than you could carry to the battlefield.We divide the machine guns between the Army, the Air and tanks.     The figures are as follows:    The Army takes 56,000, theAir takes 49,000 and the Tanks take 35&quot;,000,   Lately the Air havesomewhat reduced their estimates which&apos;were exaggerated. There isa slight difference between the air gun and the ground gun, theformer being of a rather lighter pattern.   Perhaps it is a goodthing that the Air demand was exaggerated, hecause it has had theeffect of getting things into full working order very quickly ona great scale..Now I come to -explosives.     The condition of explosivesis very good and we have nothing to worry about in that direction.We make about 5,500 tons of explosives a week but we could openout, if need he, up to 10,000 tons a week.     The explosives depend

-f s? Cl 3of course entirely on nitrates.     The Chile voyage is a longvoyage;    a ship does only 2\ voyages in the year, nnd it isconsequently very hard on tonnage.     We are completely dependenton Chile for nitrates.     The suggestion which has heen made isthat we could coerce Chile into making a certain arrangement aboutshipping &quot;by threatening her not to take her nitrates.     Such acourse would end in complete disaster for us, heeause Chile knowsthat we cannot carry on the war without her aid.     We are endeavour-ing to extract nitrates from the air, and we hope to obtain a moderate amount next year by this means but in anfr case itwill nnly amount to the equivalent of two or three ship loads.It is only by the development of this method that we can become independent of Chile.     Germany, of course, through theresearches of Professor Haber, has not only made herselfindependent of the outer world, but has provided all sherequires for the purposes of the war and in addition greatquantities for agriculture.MR. MASSEY:    By water methods ?MR. CHURCHILL:   By various processes.     We have got a process ourselves which we think is the best of all, but at present it is only on a small scale and ;just beginning to work.     We have &apos;got, luckily, one means of keeping ourselves Independent at least for some time.     We have a reserve of nearly 200,000 tons ofnitrates here.     It is the only reserve that exists on this side ofthe Atlantic.     The French and the Italians live from hand to mouthabsolutely, and confront us at intervals with the threat of a compMbreakdown of the whole of their ammunition plant and filling factories.     I then remonstrate and rebuke and negotiate and thendole out a little.MR. HUGHBIS:   Where does the German get his nitrates from ?MR. CHURCHILL:    Entirely from the air.MR. HUGHJ3S:   Why are we dependent on Chile - he cause wehave plenty of air here?MR. CHURCHILL:

MB. CHURCHILL:    Beenuse we have not yet developed thiswonderful industry.MR. CHAHBSSLAIM:    1 think it cost Oermany something like 2,000,000 before she got&apos; anything out of these&apos; experiments.SIR ROBERT B0RB8N:    It is being carried on in the UnitedStates for which purpose I think they are using the electrical power of Niagara.&apos;MR. CHURCHILL:   The filling of the explosives into theshells is also in a satisfactory condition.     Our filling plantshave feet a good reserve of capacity which makes it possible to fill this or that kinfl of shell very quickly as the military needschange, and they are always changing.     We have also a&apos;reserve in ease of disaster.     We had a very serious explosion only lastweek at Chilwell, but by keeping a certain reserve capacity we are able to go on without any apparent difficulty.How closely allied to explosives are chemicals.     Next year the British artillery will he firing from between 2  to 30$ ofthe whole of their shell charged with chemicals and with poison gasof different kinds, instead&apos;of being filled with explosives,which is an entirely new development and which is increasing.There are three methods of discharging these gases upon theenemy.     First of all, by firing them from artillery from which youwill see what a very, serious part that has become in our artilleryproblem.     Secondly, you hurl the poison over in cylinders of gasfrom little mortars sunk in the ground, and we are also preparing tohave it dropped from the air in bombs, though we have hot started on that yet for reasons which require a great deal of consider-at ion.     The third method, and I think one of the most, important,is the discharge of it in gas clouds.   &apos; The wind is favourable -,.to us six times as often as it is to the enemy, and the dischargeof gas clouds along the front inflicts losses on a very greatseals.     Gas clouds were discontinued for some time on our Bide,but they are now coming into fashion again and we hope to makea

a speciality of them in the coming season.   . there are, broadly speaking, three classifications of gas srhlch are used -lethal, lachrymatory, and irritant.     Lethal is represented bygases like and N.G. - these are the names *- and thelachrymatory gas by S.K., and the mustard gas       the irritantis called H.8.     Those are the symbols by which those are described.     In addition to this, a new type of gas is now coming forward&apos;which it is important to keep secret.     Hithertowehave tried to penetrate the mask of the enemy by sending throughit a poison in the shape of gas, or in the shape of a spray, butthe new method, which both sides are trying on each other1amasks with ceaseless persistency, is to try to - send a fine dust -little particles of solid -* which make the man cough and splut-ter and cause him great agony, which compels him to remove hismask when he becomes affected by the ordinary poison, so he getsthe benefit of them all.     On&apos;the other hand, we have been safe-guarding -ourselves against these methods and there is nothing more successful than the manufacture of the masks which the War Office,to whom the credit belongs, have now handed over to tha Ministryof -Munitions.     we have got the. best mafek in TSurops;   there isno doubt whatever about it.     We have made 11,000,000 cr12,000,000 up to date of .this complicated bos respirator which you have no doubt seen when you went to the front.    Wesupplied the Italians with-2,000,000, and also all theAmerican reinforcements, and we have still got large reserves.-We. have added a coil to the cylinder of this mask which, willprotect.us against the particulate form of attack X have justreferred to, as well as all the others.     I ought to say that oneof the big features of the Munition Programme for 1919 is thetripling

IS *itripling of the gas plants &quot;that we have this year. Iam tripling all my plants and preparing to make thisments.   The&apos;mustard gas has heen a source of menaceand.ihjury to us,    1 dare say we have lost 150,000men who have heen wounded and injured by this gas duringthe year.     The Germans have heen firing it upon us for a year and the French have only Just begun to fireit, while we ourselves have not yet started.    It hasbeen a matter of great difficulty to moke it.   Sow thedifficulties are solved chiefly by Mr. Quinan who came to the rescue,  and we have produced a really satis-factory method,  even better than the one which theFrench have.   We are so developing this   that inAugust it will he possible to begin firing it from theBritish front in appreciable quantities.    It is not a specially deadly gas hut as you know, even only totouch it causes terrible wounds and inflammation.    1hope to be producing 1,500 tons a month in the spring of next year and it should he&apos; possible&apos; &apos;to make thewhole area in which the enemy * s. troops are operatinga really infected area.   This of course has its hearingon our tactics next year,   if we take the offensivewo may he certain that one side or the other will hefiring this irritant gas with great persistency night and day along the threatened portions of attack andtherefore the troops passing over the area of attackwill all go sick in a few hours.       That is anotherreason which makes it so necessary to study what i call the &quot;vehicular&quot; form of attack by cross-countryvehicles and tanks, which alone will enable you to convey across the infected ground large bodies of men.gaswar . fere almost the largest of our new develop-

-19 - 129Lord Weir dealt in detail with the aeroplane posi-tion and really said practically all I wanted to sayon that, subject.    Of course it is -an enormous branchof our activities&apos;and very complicated to supply.Practically it is as large as the ordnance and shell.Engines are the.limiting factor.    The total output in 1916 of engines was 6,500; last year it was 16,000and this year we are trying to make 44,000 engines.The engines are of course much higher-power,  on thewhole, as well as being in greater numbers.    Thetotal demand of the jjct Service up till Septembernext year it? 63,000 engines,  including an enormousproportion of very high-powered engines.    1 think itwill be very difficult&apos; indeed to meet this demand.The engine output has fallen off in the last threemonths seriously, owing very largely to the men youare takings away.    The loss of a few skilled men,perhaps half a doss en,  sometimes hinders the work of1,500 women.     They took swear seven men from a certainplace which was making crank shafts for a particularengine the other day to make them into inf&amp;htry soldiers&apos;.The consequence is that there has been a.drop of25 engines a week in the output.    It is a melancholysituation.       My engine outputs ere seriously down,and I oen no longer make the hopeful report that&apos; i made at the beginning of the year.     I am. not pro-ducing 70ft of what I hoped to produce.

X raised, the question the other day;     Are we getting the full value for the amount of material we give to the Air Service?I know a searching study is being made by the Air Minister-, hut i must draw attention to the fact that the sort of statement thathas been made in the past, that you require fifteen machinesbehind, the line for one that was flying in the air against theenemy - statements like that ought not to be accepted as thelast word in the economy of air fighting.     X am confident that better results can be produced and we hope to make, in conjunctionwith the Air Department, a searching statistical investigationshowing the amount of value which each class of engine gives -the number of flights made, the freight of bombs dropped, and so forth, with a view to continually analysing and revising theeoonomy of this class of supply.     X hoped last-year that weshould be throwing 1,000tons of bombs a week on the Germans, and started on that basis, but so far I think we have worked uponly to 28o tons a week.     We hope that will improve very m-chin the next two or three months.SIR ROBERT BORESXT: - Is the X*merioon motor turning out well?MR* CHURCHILL:   Very good reports been made about it.They are how getting really on the move, and I think Lord- Weirthinks that may solve our joint difficulties to a very largeextent.LQRIX mmi    If we can rely on the &quot;Liberty&quot; motors itwill relieve the skilled labour position in the British engineshops,       Far too much skilled labour has been taken away,the programme has been practically, ruined, and if we can getthe American motors our difficulties will be solved.Detroit is beginning to produce motors now/.

MR. MASSJSY:    Cannot you got the skilled men back ?MR. CHURCHILL:   That is what 1 feel.X think the time has come to increase the supply ofrailway material both for locomotives and waggons as well as forthe permanent way.     It seems to me that ^e have been runningon a very fine nargin and if there is any spare capacitynext year both for the Home and the Military Hallways I must give a larger allocation of steel and of labour to themanufacture of locomotives and rolling stock.Mechanical warfare is the next point.     In regard toTanks the total programme *hich has been approved by theWar Cabinet would enable us to have   4,800 large Tanks ofvaraous kinds and 480 of the older, Mark IV, pattern bythe 1st June, 1919.lift. HUGHES:     What speed has the large Sank?MR. CHURCHILL;       It varies from 5 to 6 miles perhour.       The lighter Tank   can do up to 10 wiles, and we hovea Tank ^hich will do 15X which is as fast as &amp; cavalrycharge.     But that at the moment is in the air.     We maybe ready with it this time next year.      If you add to thatthe probable output of (Chateau Roux which is an Anglo-American ^stsiblishment9 the production of which may safe&amp;untto about 1,800 Tanks, deducting the estimated losses,perhaps you might count on having 5,000 Tanks available bythe 1st June, 1919* In addition there will be 8 to 10thousand of the little Tanks which we do not make but ontshich the Fronch and the Americans are specialising.     you can see what an enormous output of guns these thi&amp;gs require -15 or&apos; 1$ thousand 6 Pounder guns and 30*9Q0 machine guns.That is all on the way,       it is a very heavy programme;but I do not think it is enough/and

and 1 think yon axe falling snort of what will do thetrick ** and it is not heing maintained.   Taking swey so many men has led&apos; to the Tank programme even the limited one on   which we have embarked being retarded.   The Tank production is very very seriously deranged by the men who have been takensway and there seems to me to be no proportion between the-advantage derived from a few hundred infantry men and the advent age of punctual delivery of these engines of war.That brings me to two general questions with which Ipropose to close; but I should first of all like to pay a tribute to the extraordinary work which Canada has.done in theproduction of munitions,     Considering that before the Warpractically no munition   factories existed in Canada it isamazing to think that she has supplied the British Army inthe field with upwards of 08 millions of shells of variouscalibre, 45 million artillery cartridge cases, 28&apos;million fusesand 68 million lbs. of propellents and over 47 million lbs.of high explosives0    A little while ago.when the Canadianproduction was at its highest three-tenths of the total ofshell steel used by the British Armies in the field owns from canada,   Unhappily, difficulties connected with the dollarcredits and transportation made it necessary to reduce it fromthat high level, but we have in the Canadian factories,a reserve capacity which may he drawn upon if the requirements,of the Array should increase and this reserve power can alsobe utilised by the Americans,   They have placed orders for something like 14 million shell forgings and 11 millionshells quite recently in Canada,.     I think lord Weir also referred to the services of Canada in regard to aviation,she is actually taking as her basis-- the training of something like 2,000 pilots.in&apos; the year, and is making at the- aeroplane

- 23 4    fjX &amp; t*aeroplane factory at Toronto all the m&amp;ohines which sherequires for training this large body of men,&apos; as well ashelping us in regard to raw materials particularly spruce.I would like on behalf of the Ministry of Munitions to ex-press my&apos; sincere gratitude to the Canadian Government, thePrime Minister and the Minister of Finance for the enormousassistance which they have given in the supply of the armies in the field.The great distance and the shortage of tonnage hasprevented Australia from carrying into effect theefforts she made in the first months of the War to pro-dues munitions, but she produces in-valuable raw materialas far as tonnage allows.   Mere than half of our totalimport of lead comes from Australia.   We also get very impor-tant supplies of copper, and sine concentrates are now also being developed as a new feature in the supplies of mater-ials we get from Australia.The production of munitions in-India is very smallindeed at the present time.     We get manganese and shellacand other valuable raw materials from India, and they .arenow exploring the possibilities of developing munition plantcapable of supplying 15 Divisions.   1 must say in view ofthe risk to which India will be exposed if the War continuesinto 1920 it does not seem that is sufficient provision, andI think, if the prime Minister would approve, the Ministry ofMunitions and the India Office ought to - meet together and conoert a large scheme for the provision of machinery,and of a certain number of experts from this side for thepurposes of the development of considerable munition plants in India.    India may become very Seriously menaced in theyear 1920.     I would propose, if you approve, to arrange with the Secretary of State to make you a joint report with our proposals in a short - time.MRs MONTAGU.

MR. &amp;OHTAGUj 2 shall be very glad; the Ministry ofMunitions Priority Coimaittee is at present the only obstacle to the development of munitions in India.THIS prime mmsTimz    Sir P. Sinhn has already mentionedsome of the difficulties they experience in India in regardto the manufacture of munitions.MR. CHURCHILL:    $ow I would like,  if X way, te refer to two general questions in closing.     First how to use our re-maining resources of men and material so as to develop theBS&amp;iffium war power of the Country for the supreme moment andto maintain British strength ?     That is the first question.The second is how te- defeat the German Armies, in the West.Can we do it in 1919 or must- we wait until 1920 ?     All ourmunition arrangements,- and ,so forth rest on the answer to questions of that kind.     Take the second one first, theconsequenee of waiting until 19.20 will be very- serious,undoubtedly it must involve a great campaign for the defenceof India, and no one who has heard Lord &apos;Curson&apos; a impressivestatement the - other day can have any doubt whatever thatwe are menaced by most grave developments in Central Asiawhich we have no means to arrest effectually till we come tothe wide roadless and rail roadless tract between the Russianstrategic railways and the Indian -Frontier.     The only thing thatwill shield India from that blow is a victory in the Test in1.919*     We &quot;can only regain the initiative by over-comingsome great difficulty.   &apos;.I:.think the. great difficulty to he-overcome is impatience at present.      We want to chose .&amp;climaic and make a plan, looking sufficiently far ahead andthen rigorously subordinate the intervening events and make them all lead up to that,    and save up everything for that object;   make everything a mere preliminary to that asfar as we can having regard to our daily emergencies.How,

135$few it is quite clear to me that man-power will not &quot;be enough by itself; we shall never have sufficient.man-powerto pull off unaided a decision in 1919 in the West.   Thereis a difference between our position now and the one theGermans rill he in next year when we have the same numericalsuperiority as they have now.   We are tied up at four vitalplaces,  namely, Calais, Amiens, Verdun and Paris, and wehave spread out our Forces guarding those places.   Wecannot give ground &apos;&quot;hich is the flesh and blood of France.When we attack next year it will be open to the Germans -to save themselves as they have already done at thebeginning of last year by making a retirement on a portionof their front and concentrating on the defence of therest.    Therefore 1 say that it will not be enough to try to win by man-power alone.    You cannot do it,   You musthave something else, and what else can there be but a developmerit of this scientific and mechanical apparatus.   You musthave a stronger Allied Army,- that is the foundation, andin addition you,,must have a great&apos;vehicular attack not only with fighting Tanks, but with great numbers of cross-country vehicles, with all the preparations of the bent formsof artillery and gas on other partis of the front,  and withan air superiority which carries.-out. unceasing .bombing operations.    If this is the true policy for the Allies asa whole, does it not answer - the first question which i venture to ask, via. how should we employ our limitedremaining.resources of men ?   Are we to lay emphasis on menor on material ?   Obviously we have got to have both.    Buton which should we -now lay emphasis ?   I should like to pointout that the situation now is entirely different from what it was last year.   Last year we knew we were going to havea:great&apos; attack and we thought we should have to meet it without the Americans.    How we, know that the Americans

are pouring in, and we know also that wo cannot, after July .recruit any more new men who&apos; will reach the battlefield beforethe decision of the year is over,     Bo I wish most earnestly toask the Sax Cabinet to consider whether they have not reached thelimit of drawing away aien from munitions which will cripplefatally our power of supplying the Array with the scientificapparatus that alone can give it this superiority.      Comparethe difficulty and the consequence of dragging 100,000 more menfrom the munitions with the ease with which you will get 1,000,000&apos;additional Americans over to eiurope.   Besides the limiting factor on the American transportation is not now men or tonnage,it is equipment.    I have shown you that they arc solely dependenton us and the French all this year for artillery *   We nave,really equipped a very large portion of their Forces, end we canstill further encourage them by saying:    &quot;If you have no equipmentnever mind.    Come all the same&apos;.   You will not be short of gunsor any conceivable thing, because you can be supplied   when youcome over here.&quot;I venture to submit those three general conclusions for your consideration.     First of all, make a plan and choose the time,and try to force events into the proper mould; secondly layemphasis now on tine highest possible perfection of equipment and training rather than on mere numbers for the British Army,and thirdly, Which is so obvious, bring in the Americans by every conceivable means and be in a position to assure them thatwhen they arrive they will be furnished with the highest classesOf equipment.THE pkimjs MINXOTFR:      it is an absorbingly interestingstatement that we have just listened to.    I think the aostimportant point raised is as to the desirability of our coming to a conclusion as to what our general plan of operations is going to be in the future.. I ventured to raise this point withour Allies once or twice last week.    I made proposals that the versailles Military Representatives should examine the whole ofthis -

mSI&apos;? .this question.    The men on our Staffs, and more particularly those in the field, have got the whole of their energies and theirthought engaged upon immediate operations.   For instance, you cannot get General Foch to consider a problem of that kind; infact it would be a mistake to try and get him away, because hehas to repel the attacks of the enemy, and it - is.just as much ashe can do.    The same thing applies to Field Marshal uaig and his advisers, and also to General Fetain and his advisers, and, toa certain extent, even to our own Staff, though that does notapply to the same extent, but they have this in mind.    I had atalk with General Radcliffe and General Har ington on this veryaspect and I know they are occupied with this problem which mr. Churchill has referred to.    In the main the only body thatis free to consider the future is the Military Representativeswe have got&apos; at Versailles.    We definitely passed a resolutionlast week that the problem should be considered by them and itwould be very -valuable, if Mr. Churchill has ideas upon thesubject, and I know he has, if he were to send his contribution in both to the Staff, who I know are considering the question,and also to. our Military Representatives at Versailles, who willnave to make a report to the Supreme&apos;War Council probably in thecourse of the next few weeks.MR, HUGHES:   One point which I merely wish to raise but whichwe cannot discuss now is this.   The Prime Minister has spoken of the position of the French Staff, and of General foch, and,to a lesser extent, of the English Staff, and 1 have no doubtit is quite true that they have their own business to do, whichis to defeat the enemy* but 1 cannot help feeling that we mustdeal with the.situation as it is or as it undoubtedly will be,or may be.       When you speak of the Allies and of the VersaillesCouncil    do   you   not   think   that   the   Empire   ought   to look   at    this   from   our   own   standpoint-      and *.--.&apos;&apos;&apos;.&apos;.&apos;

28. -    138tand to determine what the proper policy for us ought to be ?THE PRIME MINISTER:   Of course.   That is why our staff are examining it independently of Versailles *MR. HUGHES:   You brought up a question this morning -quite naturally the French think of Paris; we naturallythink of the Channel Port3.   We have to consider our owncircumstances and endeavour to. persuade our friends to adoptsuch a policy as will promote them.    I think we ought todiscuss this at a separate Meeting.THE PRIME MINISTER;    I think it would he very much better-,-- and this is the suggestion which has jmst beenmade to me, and I think it in a good one,  that in so faras it is discussed it should be discussed rather at&apos;theMeeting -of the Prime Ministers, which by the way- we havenot held this week.MR. HUGHES:   We want to know this because we have togo back and adjust our things according to circumstances,in order to bring ourselves into line with the policy.of theEmpire.   Whether we have two years more of war,  or one year,or whether we shall want so many men      that is a matter of life and death to us, and to go and tell the people ofAustralia that the War may be over in 3 months, or 4-months,or 6 months when our policy is quite the other way, or when there is no policy at all, that&apos;will not do.   We want to know where we are. ]MR * MASSEY:   It seems to me to be quite impossibleto discuss the proposals .-,of Mr. Churchill at the time atpresent at our disposal a    As far as I am concerned I *wouldnot attempt to do it,.but there is one point which appealed to me strongly,  to which I want&apos; to refer, and it is this.I cannot help thinking that it would be simply folly to takeaway artisans from munition works under existing cireum-stances.   We want fighting men badly, , hut it is no

use putting them in the line unless we can. supply them withmunitions and 1 think steps should he taken to get as manyhack as possible.14R. 10H0:     That cannot be discussed &quot;by itself.   Thereare big labour difficulties in making a &quot;clean cut,M   At this moment I do not hesitate to say that the feeling^in the Coun-try is worse than it has ever been in regard to the War*Everything Mr, Churchill said is correct.    I am quite certainthe heart of the people is quite sound, but there is s strong feeling against our taking older men, who have already done their share by sending 4 or 5 sons to the Front,    If theseolder men are dragged out and the younger men are left in munition factories, that creates a difficulty which we haveto consider here,   and if these men are returned from the/array you cannot go on/taking the older men without creatingsuch a feeling in the Country which would be fatal,JIB, CKM82KLAJK.     Of course the British Cabinet did netcome to the decision to take,these men without a most c&amp;re-ful examination,   XJnder the pressure of events of March 31stthe cry was all for taking men,THE PRIME MINISTER.,     Not only that but my own recoilec-tion is that there were proposals to this effect by the Minis?try of Munitions.MB., CHURCHILL:      J carried them out but I have-now reached the end and 1 am only afraid of what is coming,TRl PRIME MIHISTlHj     We never went beyond what waspromised.MR, CKAMBBKLA21J;   Orders are&apos; suspended if we take so many men from this or that indsutry, and if we make excep-tiezis here and there you destroy the work of the Recruit-ing programme,, and so the Divisions must consequently go down.You cannot treat one of these demands by itself.   We&apos; deal withthem almost week by week and the moment you make a concession$n one place it reappears in a demand for a concession in another

another.SIR ROBERT BOKDKN:    What may be the greatest need ata certain juncture in the War, three month sj afterwardsmay be the least.    The situation varies till the time.    I donot imagine that it is possible to lay down a fixed rulewhich will be a guise at all -times until the War is ended.MR, CHURCHILL:    In March I -was all for taking awaythe men.THE PRIME MINISTER:    But I think you are now referring to the possibilities of the future.   When we took those&quot;men out of munitions at the early part of the german offensive this year the Americans had disappointed us.They had promised us 1? Divisions, not by July, but had promised 1? Divisions by March, but instead of sendingthese 17 Sivisions by March we only had 1.    Thus we we re-confronted with a tremendous gap which we certainly thoughtwould be more than filled up.    It la important I think thatthe Prime ministers should examine this matter as it has ahearing upon the report to be furnished by the generalStaff.   How soon do you think you will be able to give usthis Report ?GENERAL RADCL1FKB:    Between July 16th and July 19th.Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.July 15th,.1918.
