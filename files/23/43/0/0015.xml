DISCUSSION OF PEACE CONFERENCE ARRANGEMENTS.The Prime Minister: Perhaps Sir Robert Borden would start the general discussion on the Peace Conference arrangements.Preliminary Discussion between Allied Powers.Sir Robert Borden : I do not think that I have very much to say. The attitudeof the British Empire on all important questions ought to be determined by discussion in the War Cabinet, so far as there is&apos; any room for debate. Then should follow a discussion between the representatives of the important Allied nations, including theUnited States, as to the Peace Terms which should be proposed, or rather, imposed.A recent announcement credited to the Government of the United States seemed toindicate that President Wilson is not favourable to any such discussion in advance.However, the President might have no objection to an informal discussion, at least.The Prime Minister: He objects to that discussion between the Allies.Sir Robert Borden: Then I suppose he objects to any discussion whatever beforethe formal Peace Conference takes place ?The Prime Minister : Have you any general views at the present moment that you would like to indicate ?Sir Robert Borden: As I said here the other day, there are two questions whichare closely related to the proposal for a League of Nations upon which we are likely tohave trouble with the United States. They are the &quot;Freedom, of the Seas&quot; and theretention of the German colonies by the British Empire. In this connection I thinkit is unfortunate,that President Wilson is not coming here until after he has visitedFrance. ..;:r &quot;Ti^rA. ^ V&apos;;;:k^;::,&apos;,. &apos; Tlie Prime Minister: It is a pity on the whole, because I think it would haveimproved;his general/attitude.Mr. Chamberlain : Or his tone.The Prime Minister: Yes..Freedom of the Seas.Mr. Bonar Law : There has been a violent attack in the newspapers in regard tothe &quot; Freedom of the Seas.&quot;Sir Robert Borden&apos;: I really have no idea what the President means by &quot; Freedomof the Seas&quot; in War and Peace. As far as I am aware there has always been&quot; Freedom of the Seas,&quot; except, perhaps, in the Black Sea and the passage of theDardanelles.Mr. Chamberlain : There is one other exception, namely, in regard to coastal trade America reserves to herself certain rights in regard to coastal trade.The Prime Minister: As far as we are concerned there has been absolute freedomof coastal trade.Sir Robert Borden: America makes more restrictions in regard to coastal tradethan any other country. I do not think President Wilson intended to refer to coastal trade, since he says &quot;outside territorial waters.&quot;Mr. Barnes : &quot; Outside territorial waters &quot; is also meant to apply in war.Sir Robert Borden: Yes, what does he mean by ensuring &quot; Freedom of the Seas &quot;in peace ?   Is it not ensured already ?Mr. Long: Admiral Sims recently made a very strong speech on exactly the same lines as indicated just now by Sir Robert Borden regarding the action of the UnitedStates of America, in which he said that there was complete &quot; Freedom of the Seas &quot;under the British flag, and he suggested that the only country that did not adhere tothis policy was the United States of America. His speech was very significant. the gist of the speech was telegraphed, to America,, and. if is rather surprising that it hasnot been very much criticised ; but it has not, Lord Robert Cecil was in the chairwhen the speech was made, and I heard afterwards that the speech would lead to trouble with President Wilson.
Lord Heading: The situation has so much changed that people in the UnitedStates do not know exactly where they are, and they are simply feeling their way.There was a possibility that the American Government might recall Admiral Sims, butevidently the Republicans have so strong a hold, for the time being, that theAdministration has been quite disorganised, and there may be important changes.Mr. Long : Mr. Roosevelt is determined to &quot;get on the President&apos;s track&quot; over this absurd question of the &quot; Freedorrjof the Seas,&quot; and it is possible that the Presidentwill not be able to go on with it.League of Nations.The Prime Minister: We are committed to a League of Nations as a general principle, but as to the method of carrying it out, although we have discussed it, wehave never agreed to any particular plan, and I do not think that the President of theUnited States has any very definite ideas in his own mind.Lord Heading: I do not think he has any concrete scheme.Sir Robert Borden: With regard to this question of a League of Nations, weshould be prepared to state our views. It is doubtful whether any scheme yetformulated is practicable in the sense of assuring permanent results of distinct advantage.No one could withhold his sympathy and support from any proposals giving the faintestpromise of success. The report of Lord Phillimore&apos;s Committee contains the onlyconcrete proposals advanced up to date. The report of the French Committee embodiesprinciples rather than any practical scheme. The report of Lord Phillimore&apos;sCommittee has not been published in accordance with the request of President Wilson,as he desired to put forward his observations on the subject, which he has not yet done.I suggest the preparation of a memorandum containing an analysis of the various proposals and of the arguments which can be urged for or against each. This will assist in clarifying ideas and in enabling a conclusion to be reached which can,, if desired, be submitted to our Allies.The Prime Minister: Mr. Balfour is away, and we do not know who is working on this question of a League of Nations, although I know Lord Robert Cecil has been working on it. If no one is working on it now, then I think we had better appointsomeone to do so.General Smuts: You asked me some time ago if steps had been taken in regard tothis matter, and the Foreign Office have now. divided the work into six or sevensections. The question of the League of Nations has been entrusted to Lord Phillimoreto work the whole thing out. I have myself also been working at the question with sir Erie Richards, and we are also compiling a memorandum.German Colonies.The Prime Minister : But Sir Erie Richards is working on the question of theColonies.General Smuts: The work in connection with the Colonies is now finished, andsimply awaits printing.Sir Joseph Cooh: Will that come before the Cabinet ?The Prime Minister : It will be circulated.Mr. Long : We must certainly discuss it.League of Nations.Sir Robert Borden: Whether the establishment of a League of Nations is possibleor not, there is at least possible a league of the two great English-speaking Common-wealths, and, with a view to arriving at such a league, I should like again to urge thatthe United States should be invited to undertake world-wide responsibilities inrespect of undeveloped territories and backward races.Freedom of Seas.     .   ,I understand that a very full and exhaustive memorandum is being prepared uponthe question of the Freedom of the Seas.
German Colonies.I entirely agree that South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand should each putforward its case for the retention of German Colonial possessions conquered inthis war. I think a carefully prepared memorandum on this question would alsobe useful as well as upon the question of indemnities, which is both complex and difficult.The Prime Minister : The question of the fate of the German colonies is onewhich will have to he discussed very carefully. As you know we discussed it before you left, and you made one or two suggestions, but since then things have changed,and we have to face a new situation. East Africa and Palestine will also now have to-be considered.The Prime Minister : Have you anything to say, Mr. Hughes ?Mr. Hughes : Is this a general discussion ?The Prime Minister: Yes, it is a general discussion in regard to the arrangements-for the Peace Conference.Preliminary Discussion between Allied Powers.Mr. Hughes : I think what Sir Robert Borden has said in regard to the generalscheme of our deliberations is right.   We ought first of all to decide amongst our-selves what is to be the attitude of the British Empire on, say, the &quot; Fourteen.Points,&quot; and if there is anything which does not seem to be covered by PresidentWilson&apos;s terms, we should see how we can raise them.   Having decided what our attitude is to be we should then endeavour to get our views endorsed by the Inter-Allied Conference.   The Peace Conference itself would of course in these circumstancesbecome practically a recording body.   If, as I assume, the Allies themselves agree to-such views as are satisfactory to us, the rest will follow in due course.   The german delegates will not be able to do more than concur in what the Allies agree amongstthemselves.   I think, therefore, that it is of considerable importance that all of usshould have an opportunity of expressing our opinion on certain important matters that affect the British Empire.   The first one is in regard to the &quot; Freedom of these as,&quot; about which I certainly do think there is a very considerable difference ofopinion between what President Wilson wants, and what this Empire is preparedto accept.(Lord Hardinge entered at this point.)Freedom of Seas.Mr. Hughes : As regards the &quot; Freedom of the Seas,&quot; Italy, France, and GreatBritain, and I suppose also the other Allies who are to be represented at the Conference,all agree that they will go into the Peace Conference with a free hand. I donot think that this necessarily means that they will make use of their &quot; free hand &quot;in &quot;the way which Great Britain desires, although I think you may assume that Franceand Italy, and possibly Japan, too, will do so. As to the minor Powers it does notvery much matter. As the question of the &quot;Freedom of the Seas&quot; is one on whichwe cannot give way in any circumstances, and is also one which is bound up with thatof a League of Nations, we ought to have a very clear understanding what we are going to do in the event of the President proving obdurate. There is, however, lesslikelihood of that, now since he has been beaten at the elections. Still, there it is. Heis a very obstinate man, I think.Clause 3 of Mr. Wilson&apos;s Fourteen Points.Clause 3 of President Wilson&apos;s &quot; Fourteen Points&quot; deals with economic questions. I certainly think that if I interpret it correctly (and mine is, I think,the only fair interpretation), the clause as it stands, will create a good deal of trouble.The only interpretation that we ought to agree to is one that will leave each nation with the same powers that it had before the war as regards tariffs, loans, and commercial treaties. I do not know whether your attention has been directed to aForeign Office telegram recording the decision of the French Chamber of Commerce,in which it was stated that the French Chamber had decided that, in future the
4 if 7H]17 ageneral clause in commercial treaties providing for most-favoured-nation treatment, sofar as duties, and customs were concerned, was not to be inserted. I do not know,in the absence of the general purport of the discussion, what this statement means,and whether the French Chamber is in favour of the abolition of the most-favoured-nation treatment, or not. At any rate, for reasons which are quite obvious to thosewho. understand the circumstances of Australia, we cannot agree to being deprived of our right to make discriminating tariffs. I do - not know to what extent clause Zcould be held to involve the whole of the British Empire in an agreement with,regard to raw materials, and I would like to hear the views of the members of the:Government on that point. If it is held to involve the whole Empire we ought toconsider it very seriously because the necessity for an adequate supply of raw material is very vital to us in Australia.Reparation, Restoration, and Indemnities.I am not going to speak about those clauses which affect Middle Europe, and&apos;,the Russian Republic, or the nationalities of one sort and another that have been setup during the war, but there is in addition to the question of a League of Nations,,another point that ought to be considered, viz, the clause that deals with reparationand restoration on which question no doubt ought to be allowed to exist as to whatis meant.   It states that &quot; Compensation will be made by Germany for all damage caused to the civilian population of the Allies, and their property by the aggression of germany by land, by sea, and from the air.&quot;I do not think that upon a fair interpretation of this paragraph you can includeindemnities; and if so an invidious distinction is at once made between a country likeBelgium and, say, a country like Australia, or even like England. Belgium will get back, under the heading of reparation and restoration, a great deal of the loss whichthe war has caused. We shall get nothing. After all, reparation and restoration for damage done is only an indemnity in another form. The loss which Australia hassustained has not come in such a way that one cannot say they have got near us,although they have endeavoured to do so, and their efforts to do so have resulted inAustralia incurring a debt of some 300 millions. I, therefore, hold that we ought tomake every effort to stretch the interpretation of the clause, I have just mentioned asfar as it will go, and show that there is no distinction of kind between indemnities and.payment for damage done. 1German Colonies.As regards clause 5 and the question of the former Colonies, I understand thatthe attitude of the British Empire is to stand firm for their retention, but I certainlydo expect a great deal of difficulty, although not so much in regard to the Pacific.You will find that the President will offer very many or fewer objections to the pacific than to Africa.However, I think the course suggested, namely, that those Dominions who are primarily interested should put their case forward, is the best course, and in this entirely agree. I do not think that America regards the Dominions as being synonymouswith Great Britain, although she may do so and may say &quot; with all parts of the Empire.&quot;At the back of her mind she says : &quot; These are as we were, and, by increasing their territory, does not necessarily mean that it is increasing the territory of Great Britain.&quot;It may be quite a wrong distinction but, at any rate, there it is. Therefore, I think itis quite right that each Dominion should put its own case forward.^League of Nations.As to the League of Nations, I have read the Report of Lord Phillimore&apos;sCommittee, which was circulated last June or July.   It seemed a fairly comprehensivedocument, but I cannot recall it for the moment.   If it is to be published, as LordPhillimore&apos;s Committee suggests, without involving the Government, well and good;* otherwise I think we ought to discuss it.   I would like to hear what the views of the-* .        [543-10] C
(Government are on the League of Nations. As to a League of Nations, I believe in it as strongly as any man, but it depends upon what sort, of a League it is.The Prime Minister: We want to know your views as to the kind of Leaguewhich we ought to recommend as we are discussing it here ? -The Government has noviews apart from the War Cabinet. All we have done is to commit ourselves to theprinciple, but we have no definite scheme as how to carry it out. Therefore it is open for anyone to make suggestions.Mr. Hughes: I will put my views forward for what they are worth; It is a bigquestion. I will draw attention to what I object to rather than to what I agree to. Iobject altogether to President Wilson&apos;s scheme of a League of Nations. Where does itend ? I do not know. It would appear that there is no substantial difference between his view and that of Wells. That is to say, he wants some sort of world-State, in facta Utopia, in which all nations would have to surrender some of their self-governing rights.There is to be an international police and there is to be a navy and,an army, and so on,for this purpose. But it will not bear examination for ten minutes. It is a veryobvious thing that no country will allow for a moment its vital interests to be decided by anybody but itself. I speak with some considerable experience of what nations will do in that direction, and those who shout loudest for international arbitration will standmost rigidly on their own rights when a vital right is threatened. Let us ask ourselvesif Great Britain would agree to interference by any Council of Nations as regards the size of her navy. Certainly not. I will take the case which affects Australia withregard to this League of Nations. You have Japan and China, which are desirous thattheir people should be allowed to settle in Australia, which is a continent capable of holding 100,000,000 people. There are at present only 5,000,000. We have no moralright at all to refuse any more than you have in regard tO India. We have gotAustralia, and we are going to hold it, and we say to the world in respect to this100,000,000 of people : &quot;You shall not come in here,&quot; but we have no moral right tosay anything of the sort. This is all right now, Great Britain&apos;s navy and the power ofthe Empire keeps out the Japanese and Chinese, but the League of the Nations, as Iinterpret what is meant, would absolve these things, and moral right would become theonly touchstone by which every claim would have to be met. The white Australiapolicy would come up for example, and Japan would say &quot; We want to come into yourcountry&quot;; and we would reply &quot;No.&quot; The question would then be taken to theLeague of Nations. By what right can 5,000,000 people usurp territory that wouldfeed 100,000,000 ? You have no moral right at. all. Therefore they come in. Butwhilst Australia had a leg to stand on she would fight. That will not do. The rightof Great Britain to India might come up. What sort of right is it ? It comes up before the League of Nations, and 200,000,000 make their voice heard. They say :&quot; What right have you now to India, since we have had this war for liberty ? we want to govern ourselves, not by the methods of Montagu, which is to come by degrees,but by a decision of the Council of Nations.&quot; You cannot agree to any League ofNations which might do anything of the sort. The League of Nations which we could agree to would be a League binding together the United States and Great Britain Idon&apos;t care how closely and possibly France and Italy and such other nations as you may think proper. If America and Great Britain were to stand together the peace ofthe world would be assured. If France would come in it would be trebly assured, andthere would be no danger of any war and no danger of any friction. There would beno attempt to interfere with the internal Government of each nation, and although therewould be great rivalry between the United States and. ourselves we are very muchlike one another. We should not fight, although we should have a keen trade war.By common sense and circumstances we should be prevented from fighting. I do notcare what sort of a League you have; and you could have a great Anglo-Saxon Empireif you liked. That would assure the peace of the world. I think it would be workable,and we should be bound together, not by any Utopian scheme but by ties of blood, ofcommon history and of common purpose. You would find that the American thinksvery nearly like the Englishman. At any rate, he thinks very much like the Canadian1and the Australian, and we are all cousins. It seems to me that if necessary a Leagueof Nations might leave France out of account and also Italy. The League of Nations,in my opinion,-that will ensure the peace of the world is the League of Nations whosehistory and traditions and ideals are nearly alike, and a League which will not interferewith the internal government of each particular member. In 1915 the Labour Partyin Adelaide carried a resolution about a possible League of Nations, and I think theviews then expressed were just such as I am now stating.
Reparation, Restoration, and Indemnity.Mr. Bonar Law : Perhaps I might mention one thing which is a question of fact,hearing upon what Mr. Hughes has just said. The British Government has definitely-committed itself for the period of reconstruction to abolish the most-favoured-nation treatment, and the Foreign Office has written to all our Allies with whom we havetreaties, saying that, for the period of reconstruction, the question must stand in abeyance.The Prime Minister: May I just make one or two suggestions which we could actupon immediately ? Mr. Hughes has raised the question of an indemnity. Well, thequestion of an indemnity is not so easy a matter as it appears. For instance,supposing we said to Germany: &quot;You must pay Australia 300 millions.&quot; How isAustralia to be paid 300 millions ? She cannot be paid in gold. Even if you took thewhole of the gold of the German Empire I do not suppose they have 200 millions. Andif she paid all the war debts of all the Allies, Germany would have to pay20,000 millions, at least. I should like therefore to find out by what means Australiacan get her 300 millions. There are only two ways : one is by gold from Germany and Germany has not got sufficient gold and the other is by selling goods.Mr. Hughes : By credit Germany can transfer credit to some other country./   The Prime Minister : She would have to sell the goods to us mr. Hughes : N o.The Prime Minister: To whom could she sell them ?Mr. Hughes : To France or to America.The Prime Minister : But France or America is not going to be the dumping-ground of cheap German goods.There is first the policy of indemnities. If you say to Germany : &quot; You must payable debt of 20,000 millions,&quot; that means that you must hold Germany in bond and make every German workman your slave for a whole generation.Mr. Bonar Law : Far more than that.The Prime Minister : Well, far more, if you like. Say for two generations. Hewould have to work for the world in order to clear off this debt of 20,000 millions;whether he sells the goods to France or to America, that is a different question.Mr. Hughes says : &quot; No, I am not going to have German goods in Australia.&quot; Therefore,some other country  must take them in order to pay Australia the debt of 300 millions.Therefore, I want to know where the country is to be found which is to be the dumping-ground of German goods.The second policy is that we must not send raw material to Germany. If germany is to pay 20,000 millions in indemnities, and is not going to get any raw material to manufacture goods, what is to happen ? All these policies are hopelessly inconsistentand we really ought to think these things out. I can say on the platform that every penny of the 8,000 millions which we have had to raise in this country forthis war, Germany has got to pay. But if I were to say to them : &quot; How is she goingto pay ? &quot; they could not answer, as they do not think of that at all.There is only one way, and that is by manufacturing goods in Germany at acheaper rate than one could manufacture them here, which would throw the wholeof our workmen here out of work, and Germany would practically supply us with goods for the next fifty years.Committee of Cabinet to consider Questions of Indemnity.What I want to propose is a Committee of this Cabinet, which will include expertsand can sit and consider this question of indemnities. I am afraid even the indemnitieswhich we are already demanding are going to land us into inconsistent policies. Ithink you could, if you saw your way to raising the money, stretch the terms to includealmost anything, but this would, I think, be damaging in the long run : and we must consider in the first place to what extent by demanding great indemnities we willbe damaging our own trade in the future. I should like, therefore, to appoint aCommittee of this Cabinet, if someone will act as Chairman. A Committee which should include experts to advise the Cabinet in the first instance, and afterwards to advise therepresentatives at the Peace Conference.
Sir. George Foster: Is it practicable to state what is the cost of actual damage ?Mr. Bonar Law : About 4,000 millions in actual damage. The most we could claim-would be about 1,000 millions, which is more than we should ever get.The Prime Minister: I should like to find out whether there are any means of&quot;making Germany pay, which will not do us more harm in the end.Mr.&apos;Montagu: Is not General Smuts&apos; Committee working on this ?General Smuts: I think the Treasury Committee has been set up to dealwith this ?The Prime Minister: I think the Chancellor of the Exchequer might be theChairman.Mr. Bonar Law: I am afraid that is impossible with my other work.The Prime Minister : A Committee might be appointed, and Mr. Hughes ought tobe on it, because he is raising the question. Then we ought to have experts on it as-well ; and they can all work this thing out, because I cannot see my way and I say it quite frankly to demanding an. indemnity which will make us worse off than we shouldbe otherwise, unless we are to be like the old Greeks, and force the Germans to workfor us.Mr. Long : They must have raw material.The Prime Minister: Yes, you must give them raw material; they cannot makebricks without straw. I think the Lord Chief Justice ought to be on thisCommittee, too.Mr. Hughes: Of course, this is so much a political question that you can practicallyget experts to give you any opinion you please. Therefore there ought to be two.&apos;experts on the Committee, one who represents one school of thought, and the other whorepresents the other.I The Prime Minister: I have not yet been able to find a man who represents &quot; theother.&quot; If you can find a man who represents the other view, we will put him on theCommittee at once.Mr. Hughes : I did not mean that there were two views in regard to the demandingof indemnities. What I meant was the free trade view, and the opposite views. Forexample, one man will hold that exports are to be paid for by imports, and another willnot agree.The Prime Minister : Do you suggest that the Chancellor of the Exchequer will represent the Free Trade view ?Mr. Hughes : No.Mr. Bonar Law : I have never met that difference of opinion. Free Traders andTariff Reformers have a great difference of opinion as to exports being paid for by imports, but I have never met anyone who holds the view that you can pay a foreigndebt in any other way than by gold or by exports.Mr. Hughes: I did not say you could. What I mean is, the more you send out ofthe country the better for the country.The Prime Minister: Can you name any experts ?Mr. Hughes : No, I do not know of any. I might mention Mr. Harold Cox, though have never seen him,The Prime Minister: He is a violent Free Trader.Mr. Hughes : Then there is Mr. Hewins.Mr. Bonar Law: The first thing is to get a Chairman. I do not think any of us,I mean members of the British Government, can possibly spare the time. If one of thefour Dominion Prime Ministers cannot do it, I believe the best man would be Sir GeorgeFoster, if that commends itself to the others.The Prime Minister: He is the Finance Minister, and therefore in that particularline of business, and I think he is most suitable.
Mr. Hughes: I do not suggest a Committee at all, but T say that the recommen-dations of a Committee of the Cabinet would, naturally, have great weight with theCabinet, and since my Government has stated that indemnities ought to be included inthe Terms of Peace, I certainly think we ought to represent those.views.The Prime Minister : Certainly.Mr. Bonar Law: I agree. Your suggestion was on the assumption that neitheryou nor&quot; Sir Robert Borden can give the time, just as none of the members of theGovernment could give the time, to act as Chairman, but at least I hope you will be amember.The Prime Minister : Could you yourself, Mr. Hughes, give the time, as Chairman,,to work it out ?Mr. Hughes : I do not know whether I could or not. It is a very difficult problem,.I admit.  &apos;The Prime Minister: It will take a tremendous lot of working out.Mr. Hughes: Quite apart from what I might believe myself my position isvery clear : My Government has put forward certain views and, of course, I mustsupport them.Mr. Bonar Law: As regards machinery all through this war we have abandonedwhat used to be the old principle that if there was a Committee the Minister incharge of the particular department concerned must be Chairman. We have given that up long ago, because to be Chairman of a Committee means a tremendousamount of detail work that requires much time; consequently we have all sorts of committees with subordinate Ministers as Chairman.The Prime Minister : I think the political side ought to be represented. If wecan get 20,000 millions indemnity out of Germany without damaging our own tradeand business we ought to recommend it. Germany was responsible for the war, and ought to pay. There is one thing that has deterred the Allied statesmen up to thepresent from demanding the full indemnity and that is the fear that it can only be paid for by Germany selling goods. We are not going to take cheap German goods, andFrance will not take them either.Sir George Foster: The fact is we cannot help Australia by buying cheap Germangoods.The Prime Minister : That is so, and Australia will not have them.Sir Robert Borden: It comes to this, if you talk about an indemnity you must first of all find out how Germany can pay. I entirely agree that Germany should payall she can, subject to the qualifications already made. The point the Committeeshould investigate is Germany&apos;s ability to pay. Outside certain resources in gold and otherwise which we might get the only thing out of which Germany can pay an indemnity is the labour of her people, if they are supplied with raw material. That isthe whole situation, and that might be investigated by a Committee, but they will haveto work pretty fast if their Report is to be of any value to us.Sir George Foster: We do not want to duplicate effort. What about thisCommittee of the Treasury which has been investigating similar questions ?Mr. Bonar Law : If this new Committee is started they can see at a glance whatthe Treasury Committee say in regard to this question, and they can also have theassistance of those people who have reported to it. I have gone through their Report,,and, in effect, it says that the very most that we can get out of Germany is 2,000millions.   For myself I do not accept that; but that is their view.Mr. Barnes : What does that mean ?Mr. Bonar Law : It includes everything.Mr. Long: A different view is taken in some quarters in the City. I heard it said by certain people in. the City yesterday that we ought to get a far greater sum thanthat, and that we are not asking enough of Germany.Mr. Bonar Law: I am not prejudging the question. What one naturally asksoneself is, with all the immense internal (wealth in Germany, i.e., railways, &amp;c, why[543-10] D
cannot we get a mortgage on that. It does not help, however, as they would have topay it outside their own borders. Take our own debt of 8,000 millions for example, ofthat amount about 1,000 millions will be owed to the United States, and the burden onthis country of paying the interest on that 1,000 millions will be far greater than onthe whole of the rest.Mr. Chamberlain: I should like to see a Committee formed which will include theDominion representatives, and I should like this Committee to take the report of theTreasury Committee, giving an estimate which the Chancellor of the Exchequer thinkslow, and to set to work to prove it to be wrong, and to prove how much more germany can pay. Having reached this stage, they should turn specially to the people whothink Germany can pay more. After all, Bismarck was informed after the war of 1870that France could not pay what she did pay, and I think it was only one man whothought she could pay so much. Bismarck&apos;s only regret in future years was that hehad not asked for more.The Prime. Minister : That was a very small indemnity.Mr. Chamberlain : Yes, it was very small. In the present, case the conclusion ofthe Treasury Committee is that you cannot get more than 2,000 millions.Mr. Bonar Laic: The Treasury report was done hurriedly.The Prime Minister : At any rate we are not precluded from demanding a verymuch bigger indemnity from Germany if it can be paid without dumping cheap goodsupon Australia or ourselves.Mr. Montagu : Ought there not to be available for the Committee a number of WarCabinet Papers, prepared, I think, by Mr. Zimmern and one or two other economic experts?The Prime Minister : Yes.Sir Joseph Cook: Would it not be advisable to put a couple of business men fromthe City on the Committee ?The Prime Minister: Would you have them actually on the Committee ?Sir Joseph Cook : Yes ; two representative business men on the Committee. you have to satisfy the outside public view which is very widely held that Germany is capable of paying far more than we have demanded, and you can satisfy that view bestby having a couple of business men to represent it.Lord Reading: Is it not more an economic than a political question ? Politicalquestions arise after. What you want to know is : What are the economic and financialpossibilities of Germany ?Mr. Hughes: Is it not the same as calling expert witnesses in a case ? If you call aman as an expert witness are you precluded from calling other experts?Lord Reading : Quite the opposite. You have assessors who sit because of theirexpert knowledge ; you may call whoever you like, whether they are experts or not.There is an advantage in having business men on the Committee, otherwise it may besaid that this question was simply decided by politicians.Mr. Bonar Law: The inclusion of business men is likely to make too big aCommittee; and in such a case you would probably have to make the government officials members also. I think you ought to make the fullest use of our government officials, who really are very able men,.whatever you may think of them, They have theeconomic side thoroughly at their fingers&apos; ends.Mr. Long : Is there not some reason for having the Committee rather bigger becauseeverybody is so busy ?The Prime Minister: I am not a believer in big Committees. I should have thought Sir George Foster might take the Chair, with a thoroughly good man as secretary, who could get hold of the right class of business men, and that sort of thing.   I think Mr. Long,should serve on the Committee and also Mr. Hughes.Mr. Hughes : No, I will not serve on it.The Prime Minister : Well, Sir Joseph Cook will serve.Six Joseph Cook : I do not wish to serve on the Committee.
The Prime Minister : Have you anybody to suggest, Mr. Hughes.Mr. Hughes: I much prefer to remain free so that I can criticise:-The Prime Minister: Well, that is not quite playing the game here. We reallywant to ascertain what is the best thing to do. It is very easy to stand outside andcriticise what everybody else does, but here we have to help one another. Tt is no useone saying that every decision that is come to is wrong ; we really must all assist here.I am not challenging the possibility of getting more out of Germany, but let us find outhow we can do it.Lord Heading : Ought not Mr. Hughes to be the Chairman ?The Prime Minister : We have offered him the Chairmanship.Mr. Bonar Law : If Mr. Hughes is able to accept, I think he should do so.The Prime Minister : I asked Mr. Hughes if he&apos; would be Chairman, it was the firstthing I did.Mr. Hughes : I did not say a word to that.Sir Robert Borden : What do you say to it now ?Mr. Hughes : What I would say is that I prefer to&apos; have nothing to do with it;nevertheless, I will do what you want me to do.Sir Robert Borden : Sir George Foster will be very glad to have Mr. Hughes under-take the Chairmanship.The Prime Minister : If Mr. Hughes acts as Chairman, I am sure Sir George Fosterwill be willing to assist in every possible way.Mr. Hughes : I should be glad if Sir George Foster would take the Chair, though it makes no difference to me.The Prime Minister : Mr. Long will assist also; he will be able , to suggest somevaluable witnesses.   I think Mr. Hewins would be helpful too.Sir Joseph Cook: Mr. Hewins is very clever ; you should also look outside for a couple of representatives.Lord Reading : Lord Cunliffe would be a very useful member.Mr. Bonar Law: You could not leave out the Governor of the Bank if you havethe ex-Governor as a member. &apos;Lord Reading: I would suggest Lord Cunliffe and Lord Revelstoke.Mr. Montagu : What about the Deputy Governor ? He knows a great deal about this subject.Mr. Bonar Law: I think Lord Inchcape is a better man.The Prime Minister : Lord Inchcape is a Free Trader, therefore I think youought to have a man who is a Tariff Reformer.Lord Reading: I would prefer Lord Revelstoke.The Prime Minister: Lord Revelstoke is a Tariff Reformer.Mr. Long: Lord Revelstoke is a very able man, but the people you have to convince outside may not regard him as suitable. I suggest a man like Mr. Gibbsj whois practically the head of Herbert Gibbs &amp; Co., who is a very capable man, and in whom,I am told, the City has more confidence than in most other people.Mr. Bonar Law: As I have had so much to do with the City in regard to the WarLoan, I am a little afraid of arousing jealousy amongst those people with whom I have dealt.The Prime Minister: This is a private Committee,.the report of which will not bepublished.Mr. Chamberlain (to the Prime Minister): I suggest you and the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer should think this matter over between yourselves.Mr. Bonar Law: If you like I will suggest some names to Mr. Hughes after I havehad time to think it over.
Mr. Hughes: Who exactly is on. the Committee ?The Prime Minister: Mr. Hughes as Chairman, Sir George Foster andMr. Long these are the three political representatives, and I think that is sufficientpolitical representation.   Then we will see who we can get as experts.Mr. Bonar Law : Do not you think Mr. Hewins will be useful ?The Prime Minister : Yes.Sir Robert Borden : And two business men.The Prime Minister:  Yes, I will not have a bigger Committee than that.Mr. Hughes: What about a financier ? w&apos;The Prime Minister: (to Mr. Hughes): You had better look into that matter.You can see the Chancellor about it.Mr. Bonar Law (to Mr. Hughes) : You have yourself intimate friends now in theCity and you might ask these people who &apos;are working with you to suggest namesto you, and I will consider which are most suitable from the Treasury point of view.The Prime Minister : They must be men whose opinion carries weight and men of real status. If you do that, and agree with the Chancellor, I will agree to whatevertwo names you suggest.Mr. Bonar Law :  I think Lord Cunliffe would be a first-rate man.Sir Joseph Cooh : There is a certain class of people who think that Germany oughtto pay for everything, and it is a person who will represent that point of view that you.want on the Committee. .  .The Prime Minister :  They do not realise the difficulty.Mr. Barnes: There is also a feeling which is becoming very general that,,whatever you do to make Germany pay, you must not put our own people out of work..The Prime Minister: That is the very point.Further Meeting of the War Cabinet.Mr. Hughes: When shall we meet again, Mr. Prime Minister ?The Prime Minister: I should rather like to wait; I do not quite know whatquestions will be raised by M. Clemenceau, so I would rather like to wait until I see him, which I will do on Sunday evening. I shall know by Sunday night what questionshe proposes to raise, then if every member will be available for the first three days of next week we might probably arrange a meeting on Monday morning to have a discus-sion before I meet M. Clemenceau on that afternoonRepresentation at Peace Conference.Mr. Hughes : We have not yet discussed Lord Derby&apos;s telegram and general smuts&apos; memorandum.The Prime Minister: They had better stand over until we see what the Frenchideas are, so that we can discuss them together.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,November 26, 1918.
