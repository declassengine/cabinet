what the position is in regard to naval matters. Perhaps yon will permit me, onbehalf of the British Government, to give the representatives of the great Dominionsand of the Indian Empire welcome to the first. Imperial Cabinet ever held in the BritishEmpire. I need not dwell upon the essential distinction between this gathering andany other Imperial gathering we have ever held of representatives of the Empire.Previous gatherings were very properly characterised as Conferences, but this is aCabinet in the real sense of the term, with power to take decisions and to give effectto them. And it is held to take counsel about the utilisation of the resources of theBritish Empire to the best advantage in the fulfilment of the most terrible duty everimposed upon any Empire a duty upon the proper and effective discharge of which not merely the destiny of the Empire depends, but, I think, the destiny of civilisationfor many ages to come.I do not know that it is necessary for me to say because the fact is thoroughly-well known to us all that we were precipitated into this war before any opportunitycould have been afforded us to consult first the Dominions or the Empireas a whole. A few days before war became inevitable, there were many well-informed statesmen in this country I am not sure that it is not true of the majority who thought it could be avoided; and even when a European war seemed to be inevitable, there were still very many statesmen who were peculiarly qualified bytheir knowledge to judge of events, who even then thought that we need not necessarily be involved in it. And it only became clear a very short time before the declarationof war that Germany meant deliberately to provoke it for sinister ends which have since become clear to impose, first upon Europe, and, through Europe, upon the world,a military despotism ; and I am sure that the representatives of the Empire willrecognise that if they were not consulted before we had engaged ourselves in this war,it was due entirely to circumstances, not merely over which we had no control,but which many statesmen with an intimate knowledge of the facts did notat the time even foresee. However, we entered into it, as we conceived, for the defenceof liberty, for the protection of weak nationalities who were threatened by a powerfulautocracy, and we took for granted that the Dominions and the rest of the Empire .would take exactly the same view as We did, that the very highest traditions of the BritishEmpire made it imperative upon us to accept the challenge the moment it was throwndown. And the sequel proves that we were right in making that assumption; for all parts of the Empire have nobly come to our aid spontaneously and with a good heart,recognising that our quarrel in this is the quarrel of the whole Empire, and, throughthe Empire, the quarrel of humanity.The Imperial Staff and the advisers of the great Navy of Britain will present theirviews as to the military and naval situation, and therefore it will not be for me even toattempt to give.any sketch of. the position from a.military or naval point of view. TheForeign Secretary will, if not this morning, at any rate I hope to-morrow morning, give to the Cabinet a view of our foreign relations in respect of our Allies and in respect neutrals, and of the obligations into which we have entered. We shall have from theChancellor of the Exchequer a review of the financial position in this country. Weshall have from the Minister of Blockade his summary of the actual position with regardto the blockading operations of Germany. The Secretary of State for India is here also,and will submit to the War Cabinet a document in which he will review the financialposition, and the position in regard to military assistance and assistance in supplies amost important contribution for the consideration of this Cabinet. The ShippingController will also submit a paper as to the shipping position a most vital considerationwhen we come to weigh and estimate the prospects of this country in the war.I can only give a sketch of the task which I conceive is in front of us, and of theefforts which it will be essential for us to make in order to accomplish our purpose. we ought, in my judgment, to have in the first place a very frank discussion of the peace terms-such a discussion as would be impossible in public, and such a discussion as would not be possible in the first instance even with our Allies, at present-free,sincere, candid discussion amongst ourselves of what we conceive the peace terms ought,to be. That is essential, not merely in order to equip those who will enter the PeaceConference, which will come sooner or later, with a knowledge of what the Empire as awhole desires to be achieved at that Conference. It is more than that. We cannotreally measure the effort which we have still got to put forth until we have a clearcomprehension of what we are aiming at, and what we conceive to be the essentials ofany satisfactory peace. I think, it is too early to lay down in rigid detail even ourminimum demands. The war is not over, and although things for the moment seem tobe going our way, the enemy is by no means exhausted.   Plis army is-greater than ever;
he is in possession of hundreds of thousands of square miles of Allied territory ; his- power is still unbroken; he is still a very formidable, dangerous, and incalculable foe.And, therefore, whatever consideration, whatever attention we may give to the subject,however long we may deliberate, for us now to lay down, even in our own minds, in anyrigid way, even the outlines of the terms without which we could not assent to signinga treaty of peace, is something, I think, which is beyond any human council at this stage.But we ought to have a very clear idea what it is we are aiming at, what we should like to achieve, what we hope to achieve. And I think we ought to go beyond that:we should also dwell upon what we think we must achieve, unless the blood which hasbeen spilt is to be spilt in vain, aod unless the world is to be plunged once more at nodistant date into the same welter of destruction.Well, now, let us consider the things which surely must be essential to any rational,acceptable peace. The Germans must be driven out of the territories which they haveinvaded. They must abandon the lands which they have overrun France, Belgium,Serbia, Boumania, Montenegro. The freedom and independence of those countries mustbe restored, and Poland must be not merely restored, but restored under conditionswhich will give freedom to its oppressed population, and the events of the last few days in Bussia have brought that possibility nearer to realisation than it ever was before.Compensation must be demanded for the damage done to these ravaged countries. It*is undoubtedly desirable that there should also be such a geographical adjustment ofthe map of Europe, on the basis of recognising national rights, as will prevent trouble in future, secure a more permanent peace, and also make firmer and more solid the foundations of democratic freedom in Europe.Now that surely is the very least which we ought to achieve in a peace. But ifwe only accomplished so much, we should have failed in some of the main purposes towhich we have set ourselves in this terrible struggle. There are at least four or fiveother essential aims to be striven for, and the first is this : the conviction must beplanted in the minds of the civilised world a conviction that will ripen into an instinct that all wars of aggression are impossible enterprises ; that they accomplish nothing but the destruction of the aggressor. Men must in future be taught to shun war asevery civilised being shuns a murder; not merely because it is wrong in itself, but because it leads to inevitable punishment. That is the only sure foundation for anyleague of peace. There has been a good deal of discussion lately about leagues of peace,and there is no doubt at all that we should endeavour to establish a league of that kind. But unless you drive that conviction into the human mind in every land, theleague of peace will be built on a foundation of sand ; and therefore the first thing to accomplish in this Avar is to make every country feel that in future, if it attempts to repeat the outrage perpetrated by Germany upon civilisation, it will inevitably encounterdire and destructive punishment. That, I think, is essential to the peace of the world.I will come later on to consider how far we have accomplished that.The second aim which I hope will be achieved by this war is the democratisationof Europe. It is the only sure guarantee of peaceful progress. The menace to Europedid not come from its democratic countries; it came from a military autocracy. France,before the war, had just elected a peace Parliament. The majority had been elected ona peace ticket. It was the most peaceable and peace-loving Parliament that had ever been chosen in France. The election was fought on a military question, where thepeace party won, because they regarded the proposals that were set before them asprovocative. It was essentially a peace Parliament. Bightly or wrongly, it was an extreme peace Parliament. In spite of the bad leadership of the party, the Frenchdemocracy were so bent on peace that they preferred choosing bad leaders who were for peace to choosing men of much greater power and genius who they thought wereassociated with military purposes. Now that was France. Italy well, Italy was soreluctant that she was months late in coming in, and it was with great difficulty thatthe most powerful statesman there was able to persuade the Italian Parliament, evenin the end. The Italian democracy was very loth to embark on war, and if it had notbeen for the fact that they thought that there was the appeal of their unredeemedterritory in Austria, they would never have come in. Then, as for ourselves, we havebeen reproached, and probably rightly reproached, for our unreadiness. That is a very different reproach from the reproach of provoking war. The only rebuke which can bejustly levelled against the British Government was that they were not ready for war.Well, now, that was the spirit of the democracies of Europe, and if Germany had hada democracy like France, like ourselves, or like Italy, we should not have had thistrouble. It is the only sure guarantee of peace and goodwill amongst the people. Thenations are not eager for war.   And the democratisation of Europe has come nearer
within the last few days. In fact, if there is wisdom amongst the democratic rulers ofRussia, not merely will Russia become a great democratic State, but Germany mustfollow her example inevitably; and the speech of the German Chancellor within thelast few days indicates that clearly.Wei], now, what is the third aim ? The disruption of the Turkish Empire as an empire. The Turks have been ruling, or rather misruling, the most fertile and themost favoured lands in the world. They have not ruled successfully any of the landsthey have taken over, and I am not sure that they are not the only race in the worldof whom that can be said. They are ruling lands which were the cradle of civilisation,the seminary of civilisation, the temple of civilisation, and, from the material point ofview, lands which at one time were the granary of civilisation; and now those fairlands are a blighted desert, although once upon a time they were the richest in theworld. The Mesopotamian expedition and its history is in itself the greatest reflectionupon Turkish misgovernment. It proceeded through lands which were at one timeabout the richest under the sun, and yet they were so swept of everything by hundreds of years of Turkish misrule that India had to supply practically everything for the.expedition. They could only proceed slowly, after making railways and gettingtransport facilities for carrying everything there ; and yet this was a country that atone time maintained countless millions of people, and even countless armies. Now thehistory of the Mesopotamia expedition is the condemnation of Turkish misrule in that quarter of the world. The same applies to Syria, the same applies to Palestine, thesame applies to Armenia it applies to all those famed lands. Well, the Turk mustnever be allowed to misgovern these great lands in future. We owe it to these lands,for the gifts with which they have enriched mankind, that we should do something to restore their glory. There have been many expeditions from Christendom into that part of the world to wrest them from the grip of the Turk. I believe this is the last,because it is the one which is going to be successful, and completely successful. It isimpossible that these lands should any longer remain under Turkish government. Theyhave been a constant source of irritation, and friction, and war. There has been no onecause which has been so fruitful of bloodshed as the misgovernment of the turkish empire. I am not sure that even this war had not something to do with Germanambition in the East,&quot; in fact, as the Indian Secretary was pointing out to us yesterday,there is a good deal to be said for the point of view that this was one of the mainmotives which inspired Germany in plunging the world into this chaos of blood. she had made up her mind to open up the road to the East, and probably to establish herdominion in the East. Well, we are blocking that road, and the abolition of theTurkish Empire wall to a very large extent settle the European mind, and it will givethe energies of these great nations something to operate on which will be beneficent tomankind as a whole. It will be a great achievement to restore these lands to the greatglory they enjoyed in the past, and to enable them once more to make their contributionto the happiness and prosperity of the world. You will hear it from the Staff, I hope,how far we have proceeded with this task. I believe we have gone already about fortyor fifty miles beyond Baghdad.General Maurice.-Thirty-five miles up the Diala and forty miles up the Tigris.The Prime Minister. How far are we on the road to Jerusalem ?: ,  General Maurice. Well, we are at the gates of Palestine.The Prime Minister. We have entered the land of the Philistines, I believe ?General Maurice. Yes.The Prime Minister. That is very interesting.   I hope we shall conquer thePhilistines.And, as another war aim which, concerns ourselves alone, I shall be verydisappointed if this war does not lead to a reconstruction of our own country in many respects, economic, and industrial-local government, the relations of capital andlabour, the conditions of life amongst the people and generally in an improvement,in a raising of the standard of life of the vast multitudes of this kingdom ; and finally to a greater solidarity of aim and action of the British Empire. This war isalready making it a great democratic commonwealth which will exercise a real, abeneficent, and I think a permanent influence upon the course of human aftairs.- It is becoming more and more consolidated without in the lenst impinging on the freedomof the constituent parts.I do not know that I should at this stage say anything about the German colonies
which have been conquered so very largely, and in some cases entirely, through theefforts of our self-governing dominions. All I would like to say at this stage wouldbe this that I hope we will treat this question as part of the whole problem of thesettlement of the war, and not consider it merely from the point of vieAv of anyparticular part of the Empire. We shall consider it, I trust, not merely as membersof the same Empire, but also in reference to the great Alliance into which the dominionsas well as ourselves entered when they embarked with us upon this war. The extentto which we can establish&apos; permanently our dominion in those colonies must dependvery largely upon the measure of success we achieve in the war, because if the successwere partial we could not expect our Allies to bear such a very large share of the sacrifice as we who are enjoying practically the whole of the advantage. That is all Iwould like to say at the present stage on that question.Well, now, I have only given a rough sketch of what I consider to be the mainaims of this country and of the British Empire in the prosecution of this war. Are weanywhere near attaining these objects? We are getting nearer. No doubt the war hasbeen a great disappointment to Germany a very, very great disappointment toGermany. She reckoned upon having the most perfect military machine in the world.So she had. And she reckoned upon France being far inferior, not merely in numbers,but in equipment, in discipline, and in leadership. She regarded the Russian army asan ill-equipped mob, very badly provided with transport, and therefore unable to bring up her millions to the point of conflict with Germany. As for us, they thought that,from a military point of view, we were contemptible, and they said so. And theyreckoned and with some show of reason-upon being able to brhig this war to atriumphant conclusion in a very few months. There is no doubt about it-that was their reckoning, and there was a good deal to be said for it. There were many soldiersto whom I had the privilege of talking before, the war not German soldiers, but soldiersin this country who, looking at the condition of the French army and contrasting it with that of the German, thought that Germany would just walk through them withoutthe slightest difficulty, and for the first few weeks it looked as if that calculation werejustified. Now all that has gone, and the result of the war has undoubtedly been agreat surprise and a great disappointment to Germany. She has fought for three years,and at the end of it, so far from advancing, she is retreating. Her casualties are almost equal to what the whole of her army on a war footing--was at the beginningof the war, which I think was between 4,000,000 and 5,000,000 was it not ?General Maurice. -Just under 4,000,000.The Prime Minister. Well, I see the casualties are put down at a little over4,000,000.General Maurice.- Those are the acknowledged casualties.The Prime Minister. Those are the acknowledged casualties. Very well; hercasualties exceed the number of her army on a war footing before the war, and I thinkif she could have foreseen what was going to happen she would have hesitated a ,gooddeal; and I think she would have hesitated long enough not to have taken the step which, in a fatal moment, she took when she declared war, first against Russia, andthen against Belgium, and thus brought the British Empire in against her. Still, herpunishment is not sufficiently severe, even now, to create that essential conviction inthe mind of all military autocracies without which peace is impossible.Now, I dwell on this because I want later on to come to the question of what isstill left to be done, and that is the question to which I hope this Cabinet will addressitself. Germany has failed, but we have not yet succeeded. She is retreating inthe West, but she is retreating with a purpose. All you can say is, she would not haveretreated if she had been strong enough to hold her own, and she would certainly nothave retreated if she had been strong enough to advance. That is so, is it not,General ?General Maurice. Yes. &apos;The Prime Minister. But let us look quite frankly at the position. She has more men in the field now than ever she had. Her equipment is more powerful. She is inpossession of hundreds of thousands of miles of Allied territory. She is in a. very powerful military position, acting as she is on interior lines.; and the enormouscasualties which we have had to sustain before we could force Germany to take this laststep shows that Germany has still got enormous resources. I would not like to embark upon a prediction, but looking at all those objects which I have ventured to[428-1 a] I C
submit constitute the main purpose of our engaging in this war, although I am veryhopeful, I should still say it would be a fatal error to reckon upon our being able to do  destroy the military power of Germany as to be able to achieve those aims in 1917.They are purposes which Germany cannot possibly assent to unless she feels thoroughlybeaten. It would be a mistake for us to assume that we can beat her in 1917. If we can,all the better ; but for us to base the whole of our action, the whole of our arrangementsupon the anticipation that in 1917 we are going to inflict such a military defeat upon a power which in 1917 is at its strongest, might be a miscalculation which would be fatal to the whole of our purpose.To attempt less than those aims which I have indicated would mean the renewal of the conflict at no distant date, the throwing away of the great sacrifices whichhave been made, and the postponing of the great struggle for the elimination ofwar and of the military autocracy which means war, until another generation, perhapssterner, more purposeful, more tenacious in the prosecution of its ideals than the oneto which Providence has first entrusted the accomplishment of this great task.The Allies are depending more and more upon the British Empire. Ministers whohave visited other countries will bear me out in saying that each time they go to thosecountries they feel that there is on their part a greater and a greater dependence uponthe strength of the British Empire. VVe started with 100,000 men, we have got -3,000,000in the field ; but that is not all, as I shall point out. Lord Milner has just returned from Russia, and that is the tale he tells of it; they are all looking to Great Britain,and that is even more the case now after this revolution. The autocracy there was probably looking to us less than the people; but now that the people are on top their wholehope is centred in Great Britain. Lord Milner and I went to Borne, as you know, andwe found exactly the same thing there. Many a time the Foreign Secretary and Ihave had to visit France, but invariably we have found, each succeeding time, a growing dependence upon the strength of Great Britain. And that is inevitable,because it is not merely that we have increased thirty-fold, with the magnificent help which has been given us by the Dominions and by India, the numbers of our armies-they are depending upon us for other things which are just as essential to the wagingof a successful war. Our finance is their very life-blood, without which they could not get on 1 will not say they could not have got on for a single day, but they would only have tottered along and staggered along had it not been lor the financial support which great Britain had given them. Then there is our shipping they would starvewithout it. It is not merely that they would not have their cannon and their shell,because we are bringing them steel and ore and material for their cannon, but theywould starve. France, a great wheat-producing country, has to depend upon the fleetsof Great Britain for her daily bread. The same thing applies to Italy; the millions of Italy would have died of starvation had it not been for the British Empire. then there is coal they have got to get their coal from here. The mines of France are inthe hands of the enemy, and we have got to supply them with coal. In men, inmaterials, in food, and I think ] should add in moral, more and more they are dependingupon the &quot;physical, the material, the moral support which the British Empire is giving to the whole of its Allies in this gigantic world struggle. The sense that we are getting more and more behind them is giving them most of their courage, and thatsense is increasing.I say at once we could not have done it without the help the Empire has given us.It is impossible in words to describe our sense of gratitude and the thrill of pride withwhich we always think about the way in which the Empire came to our assistancewhen we risked the life of these islands upon the struggle for liberty in Europe. Wehad 100,000 men to go to France at the beginning. The Dominions and India have practically given us a million already. It is really very difficult to dwell uponwhat we feel about that; and the achievements of their valour well, they are just ahousehold tale on every hearthstone in these little islands. We know what we owe tothe Dominions how, in the first battle of Ypres, when our little army had all been pratically thrownun, and there was nothing left between this powerful military machine and our shores (and if they could have concraered the Channel Heaven knows whatwould have happened then), the gallant soldiers who had come from India were thrownin, and helped to turn the scale at their first struggle. And in the second struggle,when for a second time, by a diabolical device a device which had been consideredhere; we knew about poisoned gases too, but we disdained even to discuss them at this table, and when the matter was mentioned we said &quot; No, we won&apos;t look at that&quot; andwe absolutely refused even to debate it at this table when, I say, by a diabolicaldevice the French lines were broken, and the Germans for  a second time nearly
succeeded in their attempt upon the Channel upon which we depend so much, we shall never forget how the valiant sons of Canada helped us. And so I might go throughthe whole list ; it is no use beginning to select instances. New Zealand, SouthAfrica, Newfoundland, India, all have played their part; and here, last of all, we see how the brave sons of India are sweeping the Turks before them in the land ofMesopotamia. We all know these things, and it is the fact that the Dominions andIndia have come in, and corne in not merely to show that they are contributing, but come in with the whole of their might and strength it is that which has turned the scale inthis great struggle, and we wish to acknowledge that. And Australia too, of course the glovious fights&quot; of Australia in the Dardanelles and Posienes, and many anotherfield where they sustained heavy lists of casualties all that lias really made theinfluence of the British Empire, believe me, cominant in this struggle. It reallydepends upon what we do how this struggle is going to turn out ; whether it is going tobe a sort of a defeat it cannot be -but whether it is going to be a sort of half success which will mean a repetition of the struggle, or whether it is going to end in a victory which will create a.new world such as has been the vision of many of us for years. our army a great citizen army has become a veteran army. Its amateur officers are becoming skilful, trained leaders of men, and if this struggle goes on, we shall have to depend more and more upon the British Empire.Now what is it necessary for us to do ? That is what I want to put before thisgathering. What is it necessary for us to do in order to achieve the very sublimepurpose which we have set before us ? The first thing we must get is this : we must get more men. Germany this year has put every available man into her army,relying undoubtedly upon our not being able to carry the conflict beyond 1917.She has therefore made the most amazing effort. She has called up men fromunessential trades, she has organised the whole of her civilian population, and practically all her able-bodied men have been flung into the conflict in 1917. Ifthe war goes beyond that, France cannot help us. France has already put oneout of six of her male population I beg your pardon, one out of six of thewhole of her population into this struggle. It is a most wonderful effort, and she cannot do more. She has put her &quot;blouet&quot; in, and that is all she can do.Next year she has got 200,000 or 300,000 coming on boys of 17 ; she can do thatnext year, and that is about all she can do. Then Bussia. Well, Bussia is Bussia.You never can tell what she can do ; and the trouble of Bussia is that if she could put men in, she has not got the lines of communication, the transport, which wouldenable her to make use of those men. And., therefore, the winning of this war in thereal sense of the term, depends upon the efforts which the British Empire is able toput forward.Well, you will have figures circulated which will show exactly what we have alldone Great Britain, Ireland, and the rest of the Empire. We are relying upon getting a good deal more assistance from India, especially in the breaking up of the Turkishpower. I am sure that the resources of India, which have been willingly andenthusiastically placed at the disposal of the Empire in this struggle, which she hasmade her own just as much as it is ours, will be available for any further effortsthat she may be called upon to make ; but undoubtedly it would enable us to concentratefar more upon the struggle in the West if India were to be able to undertake thelarger share of., the effort Avhich is to be made in the struggles in Mesopotamia, and egypt more especially. Then, efforts have been made to secure more labour from India  because there we have a great scarcity. There ia a great scarcity behind the lines inFrance, and this struggle is becoming very largely a matter of making roads, con-structing railways, and generally making the access to the front, improving the access to the front, so as to enable us to bring up our ammunition and men. Thereundoubtedly India could render us enormous assistance in the way, not merely of helping us with labour for that purpose, but, subject to what the War Office say, I personally think there are many men now engaged upon work behind the lines, andaltogether right up to the lines, who I think might be replaced by men from India. Ithink we might incorporate into our armies men from the great Empire of the East whowould release other men for other purposes men not merely from the Army ServiceCorps, but I have also asked the War Office to consider whether even in the artilleryit is not possible to. utilise very large bodies of men from India for the purpose of bringing ammunition up and for other purposes, because there are hundreds of thousands of men absorbed in the artillery ; they are not all gunners; there are very largenumbers of men who could be replaced by others without a very considerable amountof preliminary training being required to make them efficient for such purposes.
Well, that is one point which I wished to bring before the Dominions and beforeIndia. I have already drawn the attention of the Prime Minister of Canada to thequestion of tonnage. Canada more especially could help us very considerably in thematter of tonnage, because the whole of the campaign depends upon the tonnage ofGreat Britain, and if Canada could help us in the matter of shipbuilding it would be an enormous assistance to us. I was hoping to be able to make a similar appeal toAustralia, had a representative been present from that Dominion. I do not know towhat extent New Zealand can help us in the matter of shipbuilding, but Mr. Masseycan no doubt tell us later what is possible to be done in that respect. As to roadmen,woodmen, and matters of that kind, we have already made an appeal to Canada and toNewfoundland to help us.I have to apologise for taking up a very much longer time than I had anticipated in placing these considerations before the Cabinet. To be ready for 1918 means victory,and it is a victory in which the British Empire will lead. It will easily then be thefirst Power in the world. And I rejoice in that not merely for selfish reasons, but because with all its faults it is the truest representative of freedom in the spirit evenmore than in the letter, of its institutions. We are here representing a great manyraces. Even in the United Kingdom there are three or four different races, and theDominions and India, representing a very considerable number of races, are of their freewill coming together to tender spontaneously their assistance to the Empire in this great struggle. That I regard as the triumph of the spirit and tradition of Britishinstitutions; and therefore, when I foresee that in 1918, with a special effort on thepart of all of us, we shall be able to win not merely a great triumph, but to win it through the agencj^ of the British Empire, I feel that it is worth our while to take stepsto organise the Empire now, and to enable it to attain the heights of noble achievementand influence in the glorious task which is set before it. I apologise to you, gentlemen,for having taken up so much of your time.Sir Robert Borden. May 1 express, so far as Canada is concerned, our appreciation of your words of welcome, and of what you have so kindly said as to the efforts whichthe Indian and Overseas Dominions have made toward the winning of this war. Theideals and purposes which you have described were manifest to the Overseas Dominionsat the very inception of the war. The British Empire owes something to the issue which germany herself raised, for the spirit manifested by the enemy nations in preparing for and precipitating war, and in the methods by which they have carried it on theircynical disregard of treaties and of accepted international usage, their barbaroustreatment of Allied territories in their occupation, the terrorism which their militaryforces have imposed upon the civil population of those territories, their ruthlesssubmarine campaign all this aroused in the first place the spirit of the OverseasDominions, and has since maintained their purpose as it has been manifested during thepast two and a half years. The Canadian people have taken part in this war becausethey believed that the Empire was fighting for right and liberty, and because they realised their duty as one of the Empire&apos;s nations. That, T think, expresses very briefly,but very completely, our purpose.I entirely agree that our entry into this war would be worse than useless if thesupreme purpose for which it was undertaken should not be accomplished. Althoughthe war was precipitated by the military autocracy of Germany, I have become moreand more convinced as it has proceeded that the spirit of the autocracy had communicated itself to the German people. This war will not have been carried on toany useful purpose unless such a result is attained as will make it clear, not only to theGerman military autocracy, but to the German people themselves, that a war of aggression cannot be undertaken as a profitable- business enterprise. The Germanpeople were convinced that their experiences of 1864, 1866, 1870 might be repeated;and I have no doubt that this purpose, on a much grander scale, was intended in 1914.So I thoroughly agree that all our effort and sacrifice will have been in vain unless this war is carried to such a conclusion as will make it apparent to the German people that anunprovoked aggression cannot be profitable to them, and unless that lesson is learnedby the whole world.The Overseas Dominions of the Empire, so far as land forces are concerned, were,I suppose, very much in the same position as the United Kingdom. We had the samenjbblems in Canada as you have had here when we felt it necessary to embark upon theorganisation of military forces upon a much greater scale than we had first supposedwould be necessary. There has been a practical unanimity among our peojole inundertaking that tremendous effort, and we are prepared to continue it so far as may be
90-possible and necessary. Of course, in our country we have certain elements to whomthe purposes of the war do not appeal so strongly as to other portions of our population.With respect to one of these elements, perhaps some change for the better in thatregard may be discernible at present. Our forces already sent overseas amount toabout 300,000 men. I am glad to hear from the Prime Minister that the efforts ofIndia and of the Overseas Dominions have been of important service. In Canada weare proud - our people are proud of what the Canadian forces have achieved : theyare equally proud of the valour, spirit, and determination which have been evinced anddisplayed by the Indian troops, by the forces from the other Overseas Dominions, andby those from these Mother Islands.It is not desirable to-day to speak in any detail upon the terms of peace whichhave been outlined by the Prime Minister. We shall be better able to consider themafter we have heard from the Foreign Secretary and from the naval and militaryauthorities. With regard to what can be done by Canada in the future in ship-building, I am sure that her utmost efforts will be exerted. The Prime Minister didnot allude to assistance from the United States, or to the conditions which might develop in case that country should enter into the war. Of course their industrialdevelopment is much more advanced than our own, not only in shipbuilding, butin other facilities for industrial output. Possibly greater relief might be obtained fromthat source than is generally realised, because they are a very resourceful people andof great adaptability. While I suppose their shipbuilding facilities are not comparable to those of the British Islands at present, I am confident the)&apos;- could be very greatlydeveloped in the immediate future.The demand is for more men in the fighting line. The demand also is for men who can undertake necessary duties, such as railway construction, forestry, and other workbehind the fighting line. I am not prepared to say at the moment how many men wecan still send from Canada, but we shall do our utmost. For work in which we have special experience, such as railway construction and forestry, I am confident that wecan render a great deal more aid than we have given up to the present time, andwe shall be prepared to do it.I feel that the purpose for which we are gathered together round this table is bothimportant and necessary. While the Overseas Dominions have taken what is forthem a very considerable part in the prosecution of this war, there has not been offered to them up to the present an opportunity for any such consultation as thatwhich we are now having. It was due to the Overseas Dominions that this step should be taken. The causes on which this war arose were in one sense causesin which the Overseas Dominions had no voice whatever; in fact, one of the treaties brought into question in this war was made long before the Dominion ofCanada or any other of the Overseas Dominions had ,come into existence in theirpresent constitutional form. We took part in the war for the reasons 1 have mentioned I am speaking for Canada ; the other Dominions will speak for themselves but taking that part we have felt, and 1 presume it was a natural feeling, that greater opportunities for consultation ought to have been allowed. I do not desire to be misunderstood; i thoroughly realise that in the difficulties inseparable from theorganisation of the British Empire on a military basis to win this war, it was perhapsimpossible to do more than has been done in that regard.So far as we are able to bring further assistance to the supreme purpose for which thewar has been undertaken, we are not only willing but eager to consecrate our bestefforts to that great end. I am sure that the events of recent weeks, while they may .not have all the significance which is perhaps attached to them in popular opinion,will, nevertheless, have a very stimulating and encouraging effect upon public opinion in all parts of the Empire. We have been hungry in Canada for good news as to the war&apos;sprogress. In our Dominion, detached in distance from the actual scene of conflict, wehave eagerly looked from day to day for news of an advance, for news of encouragement and cheer. It is a happy augury that the calling of this Conference is coincident withthe recent marked successes which have attended the Allied armies in almost everytheatre of war.Mr. Massey. Sir Ptobert Borden has spoken on behalf of Canada, Mr. PrimeMinister; will you allow me, in addition to what he has said, to thank you onbehalf of New Zealand for the welcome which has been extended to the representativesof the Overseas Dominions at what you have rightly said is the first truly imperial cabinet in the history of the EmjDire.    I hope and believe that its deliberations[428-1 a] &quot; D
will be for the benefit not only of the Empire but also of the people whom in each caseat present we specially represent. I am quite certain of this, Mr. Prime Minister that though the responsibility which devolves upon us.at present is a very heavy one,that never in the history of the Empire have the people who managed public affairs had so many opportunities for good as those which are open to us now. (Hear, hear.) AndI hope and believe that those opportunities will not be wasted that they will notbe thrown aside-but that they will be taken advantage of to the fullest possible extent.I would like to say how pleased I am to see here this forenoon the representativesof India (hear, hear), not only on account of the part the people of India have taken assoldiers and citizens in the great struggle through which the Empire is passing, butalso because it is undoubtedly a recognition of their right to take part in the con-sideration of questions specially affecting- the great country to which they belong.You, Mr. Prime Minister, referred to the fact that the Dominions were notconsulted with regard to the declaration of war which took place in the beginning ofAugust 1914. That, of course, is correct, but I would just like to say and I think know the feeling of the Dominions upon this point; I certainly know the feeling onthe part of the people of New Zealand and in the southern hemisphere and I will say this, that the Dominions thoroughly agreed; bhey knew perfectly well that it was quite impossible for the British Government to consult them ; they realised that the honour of the Empire was at stake, that the honour of the citizens was at stake, and thatthere was no other course open but that of drawing the sword and going to war.We can congratulate ourselves now upon what you have pointed out that theoutlook is very much better than it was even a few months ago ; but we know perfectly well that the position is still a serious one, and that it may be a long time before wehave the opportunity of discussing peace terms seriously, and of entering upon peacenegotiations. I do not propose to discuss what you have said with regard to peace terms, except upon one point; but I would just like to say this : that though we maynot be able to end the war during this year of 1917, much as we should like it muchas I should like it, much as the people we specially represent would like it I have no hesitation in saying that though we may not be able to end the war in 1917, I am sure of this, that, speaking generally, the people of the Empire are prepared to go on untilthe power of Germany is broken.   I hope that will be soon.Just one other point. You touched lightly, Sir, upon the possibility of what might happen to those territories which were the German Colonies before the war, andwhich are now held as enemy territory by British troops. I am only going to dealwith a very small point in that connection, and it is one with which New Zealand,I may say, is specially concerned. We have felt for a very long time past that in theGermans we had very bad neighbours in the South Pacific. We have got rid of them I hope permanently. We have got rid of them, so far as New Zealand is concerned,by taking possession of Samoa and let me say this, that if we have to. give backSamoa and allow the Germans to re-establish themselves in the South Pacific it will bethe bitterest pill that the New Zealanders have ever had to swallow. I leave general smuts to speak about South Africa, and he will probably speak strongly, but I canspeak of the South Pacific, and that part in which New Zealand is especially concerned,and I speak of what I know.Then there is another point I want to mention, and it is this. You referred to thefact, and it is a fact, undoubtedly, that this war is going to lead to the reorganisation of the Empire. I hope it will lead to a complete reorganisation ; I hope it will leadto a development of our resources in every way in a way that has never been attempted up to the present time. I hope that we shall never again be caughtin the unprepared state in which we were found when this war broke out; and I hopeit will lead to a state of things in which the Empire will be able to produce sufficientfood for its own population, without going outside to foreign countries.I am not going to aeal with migration, and preference, and many other subjects which in the ordinary course will come up on the other side of this Cabinet;but I would like just to say this one word on a subject which, next to the winningof the war, is uppermost in my mind. I hope that this War Cabinet, whichis meeting for the first time this . morning, will have as its outcome that for alltime the Dominions will be properly represented in the councils of the Empire.I hope that it will lead to a strengthening of the Empire, and to a closer union of its constituent parts.That is all I wish to say, Mr. Prime Minister, and P thank you again for thewelcome you have extended to us.
11fThe Prime Minister. I am sure you will all like to hear one who is not merely arepresentative of a great Dominion, but who has proved himself to be one of the mostbrilliant Generals in this war, arid who, in driving the Germans outside a greatterritory, has given us a striking exhibition of skill, courage, and resolution^General Smuts.-Mv. Prime Minister, I am very thankful to you for your goodwords, which I do not personally deserve. I also wish to thank you for your words ofwelcome to us this morning, and I am only very sorry that my chief has not been ableto be here. T am sure that if he could have been present at this Conference, by his military understanding and genius, and his political wisdom, he would have been ableto contribute very considerably -much more than I ever could to our councils here.We are the only part of the Empire which has had to face from the very outsetinternal trouble, and of a very severe character; and the position, although it ismuch better, and much safer and sounder now, is still such that General Bothathought he should remain there.With regard to our work, I have listened with very great pleasure to your state-ment here this morning, Mr. Prime Minister. I am not going into any of the mattersupon which you. have touched ; but I am very glad that we are reaching a point atwhich we can define what we are fighting for. I think the time has come when we have very clearly to make up our minds what we are fighting for, the objects we have inview, and how we propose to achieve them. The war has lasted a long time, and theworld is getting exhausted. What you say is perfectly true-that we are a sort offinancial, and economic, and moral mainstay to the whole of our Allies ; but the worldis feeling the pressure-1 am sure our Allies must be feeling it and the time questionis becoming important. We are now in the third year of the war ; the war will not goon for ever, and we want to achieve success we want to achieve the objects for whichwe are fighting. And if we want to achieve those objects the time is coming when we should clear our minds, see what we are fighting for, and see what is the best wayof shaping our military, our diplomatic, and our whole policy in order to achieve theend we have in view. I think this Conference may do an enormous amount in theway of clearing the situation, and in defining to ourselves what our objects are and how we propose to achieve them.The power of the defensive, of course, is enormous. When you drive a countrylike that of the Germans a vast Empire like that to the defensive, as they are beingdriven now  and When they come to have the idea that they are fighting for their existence as I have no doubt the German people at present think is the case, it isenormous, the power that they will develop. We have, therefore, a veiy difficult situation to face, and we have to consider the whole position very carefully, and see what we want to achieve, and how we can achieve it, and direct our plans accordingly.On details I do not propose to speak. I daresay we shall have statements whichwill make it clear to us what the whole position is, and then it will be more possible togo into the details.Sir Edward Morris. Mr. Prime Minister, I should like to add one or two words to thank you for your welcome here this morning to the various Dominions. I do not know that I can add anything to what has been said by Sir Bobert Borden, Mr. Massey,and General Smuts, who have just spoken. I speak for the smallest Dominion, and Iam sure we shall be only too delighted to go on, no matter how long the war lasts, and make our contribution. And, with General Smuts, I should hope that at a very earlydate we may be in a position to know what the chances are of, in time, absolutelybeating&apos; the Germans, because no matter in what form we may accomplish the higheraspirations and ideals suggested in your speech, it seems to me that even though wehave to take another year, or two years, if there is any possibility of beating them, thatis really the one way in which we can accomplish what we have in view.Mr. Austen Chamberlain. Mr. Prime Minister, before asking the Maharaja, ofBikaner to speak on behalf of India, I should like to ask your permission to say onesentence myself. I would like to express the thanks of all of us, and of the Governmentof India, that Plis Majesty&apos;s Government should have summoned representatives of Indiato this Conference and perhaps I might also be allowed to thank Mr. Massey for thevery cordial words of welcome to which he gave expression in speaking of my colleagues.His Highness is chargedwith a message from the Buling Chiefs and Princes ofIndia, but though it comes specially from them I think I may say that it represents thespirit not only of the Ruling Princes and Chiefs but also of the people and of theGovernment of India.[428-1 a] E
The Maharaja of Bikaner. After the words which have fallen from the distin-distinguished representatives of the Dominions, I think it is only necessary for me to tender to you thanks on behalf of India for the kind words which you have addressedto us; and I can only add, without detaining you for any length, that it is our desireto help in every way we can, and that we shall gladly do our best and our utmost to render what further services we can when we know the best way in which we can doit. But as Mr. Chamberlain has just said, I have the honour and the privilege and thepride of bringing a message from our Ruling Princes, which I can assure you expresses the-sentiments of the Government of India as well as of the people of India ; and with yourpermission I will just read extracts from it. It is our desire to help in every way wecan and we shall gladly do our best to increase to the utmost the effort of India when we learn in what ways our help can best be given. At a banquet which I attended atBombay His Highness the Maharaja of Patiala, one of the Ruling Princes, one of the rulers of the Punjab States, gave me this message :-&quot; Following our traditions of loyalty and attachment to our august Emperor,His Imperial Majesty, and inspired by the clarion call of duty, we, the Ruling Princesof India, feel only too eager to participate to the best of our humble abilities in theburden of the great responsibility which has been laid on the shoulders ofthe Empire. Such a desire is as natural to us now as it has been in the past, whenon similar occasions, though of lesser moment, spontaneous offers of loyal supporthave gone forth from us and valuable services have actually been rendered to theBritish Government.&quot; In the present great struggle, we are anxious to see the complete overthrowof the Central European Powers in their campaign against civilisation andhumanity, and we, eagerly look forward to the d&amp;j when Britain and her Allies willunfurl the banner of victory.&quot; For our Emperor and the British nation it is a true &apos; Dharma Yudha &apos; a fight tor righteousness- -in which India is only too proud to participate, and tomake any sacrifices that it may involve. I am expressing the united feeling of the ruling Princes of India in expressing to His Imperial Majesty and to his Govern-ment, as well as to our brethren in Great Britain and her colonies, our earnestassurance that India&apos;s Princes will spare no pains to co-operate in the cause of theEmpire ; that their, staunch devotion and lo) alty to the august person of HisImperial Majesty, and their feelings of steadfast friendship and alliance with thenations of Greater Britain, will find satisfaction only in practical demonstrationthereof; that their determination to be of what,humble assistance they can in thepresent crisis will be even more resolute, if that is possible, than it has been inthe past; and that no accident, trouble, or sacrifice shall deter them from thecourse which they have laid out for themselves. We have no other motives but those of pure attachment to His Imperial Majesty the King-Emperor, and such asspring from unity of interest with Great Britain and her colonies.&quot;After that, any further words from me would be superfluous.Mr. Walter Long. I need only say a very few words, because a statement willbe circulated setting out what the Crown colonies have done. As the Cabinetknow, there are special difficulties in connection with the Crown colonies. Thewhite population is, in nearly all cases, in a great minority, so that there are alwayspossibilities of trouble ; and at the beginning of the war a very large proportion of theavailable white people left to join our forces, either here in England or (in some cases)they returned to the dominions to which they belong and joined the forces there.And that necessarily deprives the Crown colonies of their ordinary governing orprotecting element. But, none the less, they have come forward, I think, reallymagnificently; they have found troops in very large numbers, and they have, to thevery best of their ability, not only made actual grants in money, but they have pooledtheir resources for the Empire in a way which has been of enormous benefit to us andhas really very largely strengthened us. There have been most wonderful testimonies(which I hope the Cabinet will take an opportunity of reading for themselves) from the natives who are under British rule. It has been, I think, one of the most remarkablecontrasts of the war that, whereas the natives who have been under German rulehave rejoiced at their release from German rule, and have given, as we all know,most unfavourable accounts of some of their experiences, it has been almost invariablythe case that natives under British rule have considered this as an opportunity of
OGtestifying their respect for British rule and their desire to remain under it; and therehave been the most touching letters received from races in different parts of the worldgiving us contributions in money small in themselves, but veiy large when judged bythe resources of the people from whom they come. It is a splendid tribute to themethod and system of government by the British Empire.I do not think I need trouble the Cabinet with anything further now. The crown colonies Statement will be circulated and will give full information. In three of theCrown colonies compulsory service has been established; in another it is underconsideration; and the Cabinet may be assured that, if more men can be got, by onemethod or another they will be got, and that there will be no relaxation on the part ofthe Crown colonies in what they believe to be their duty, namely, making every possible contribution they can. And I think the statement which will be circulatedwill show that so far they have done their duty.o
