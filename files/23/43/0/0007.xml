Mr. BALFOUR: I understand that I am desired by the Prime Minister andthe Imperial War Cabinet to make a survey it can only be a partial survey ofthe foreign affairs at the present time. The field is immense, and I do not think itis worth traversing in its entirety, especially as Lord Curzon will deal with partof it-not the least important part later on. Lord Curzon is the Chairman *bfthe Eastern Committee, which includes representatives of the India Office and theForeign Office, and it is suggested that he should discuss the new and rather dis-quieting developments which have taken place in the East since, under the SovietGovernment, Russia has fallen into complete collapse. I shall, therefore, nottouch upon that branch of the subject, nor do I think it is worth my while discussing the countries such as South America, which are not immediately related to thewar.Every country at this moment is affected by the war, and it is a surprising,and almost disquieting reflection, for the Foreign Minister to find that his policy,or his efforts, in places as far removed from each other as Mexico and Persia,depend upon the day-to-day operations on the Western front. We get information from Teheran, for example, to say that whether the Persian Government will orwill not yield to a certain demand depends upon the events on the Western front.We get from Mexico a statement to the effect that the question of whether Carranzathrows himself more openly than he has hithertb done in the arms of the germans will depend almost entirely upon the turn of events on the Western front.Diplomacy in the face of a situation like that is almost powerless. No telegrams,however persuasive, no argument, however conclusive, have the slightest effectcompared with the facts, or the interpretation of the facts, put upon the militaryevents by the different Governments who are watching with intentness the swayingfortunes of the great battle.I think perhaps it will best meet the convenience of the Imperial War cabinet if, as regards the Allies, I confine myself to a very few observations about France,Italy, Belgium, Greece, and Japan, and as regards neutrals, Holland and Spain .and I shall have something to say when I have dealt with those aspects, aboutRussia, and something also t&apos;o say about enemy countries.About the Allies, whom I have enumerated, I think we may say with confidence that the moral of France and Italy, in spite of military difficulties and militaryevents which have not been wholly favourable to the Allied cause, the moral is better than it was a year ago. You never know how long a particular mood willexist in any country, least of all in the Latin countries.&quot; They change more easilythan those of northern birth, and even those of northern birth are not alwaysconstant in their outlook on contemporary events. But, of courjse, F&apos;rance is beginning to see more and more that unless the War is going to end favourably tothe Allies, France sinks for ever, without any hope of redemption that I can see,into the position of a third-rate Pfower. The French are realising that, and theirpatriotism, as well as their historic pride, revolts against it, and I am inclinedmyself to think that unless quite unforeseen misfortunes overtake our cause, Francewill fight on as long as she finds great Powers like America and ourselves ready tofight on her side. That is my hfope, but it is also my belief, a belief, I admit, which you cannot hold with absolute security, but which I venture to hold with some con-fidence.Italy entered the War, not for defensive, but for offensive purposes. She isunlike France; she is a young country, and very ambitious of expansion, and withgreat, if rather undefined, ambitions, to be an Eastern Mediterranean Power, or at least, to be on an equality with France in the Western Mediterranean. It hasbeen curious to watch through these years of stress and strain, when one wouldsuppose.that all that Italian, or, as a matter of fact, French, statesmen would have time to think of would.be how to drive away the danger from their doors, a danger which threatens their very existence, how much rivalry there exists betweenthem in other parts of the world. The Foreign Office has constant smalltroubles, for example, over the rival claims of Italy and France inPalestine; over the settled policy of the Italian politicians to get on anequality with France in connection with all Eastern Mediterranean affairs, andit falls to Britain to act, as far as possible, as peace-maker betweenthem. Allies though they be, they do not love each other. No French admiralwill serve under an Italian admiral; no Italian admiral will serve under a french admiral, and that really complicates the position, which, as the Imperial WarCabinet, I think, already know in fact, certainly do know, because the Prime
Minister dwelt upon it in his opening statement aggravates the difficulties ofthe maritime position, already great, in what is our weakest maritime spot, namely,the Mediterranean and the approaches to the Mediterranean. But Italy itself,under the stress of its great defeat last year, has begun to realise that if it is to exist it must fight, and it is fighting now in a very different spirit, and with, asfar as I can judge, a much more united spirit than it did in the earlier, and in onesense, mere ambitious stages of the war.Of Belgium I need say nothing, or scarcely anything. The Germans are mak-ing frantic efforts permanently to destroy the country which for the moment theyhave overrun, plundered and oppressed, and they are trying to destroy it or makeit subservient to themselves, which is very much the same thing, partly by politicaland partly by industrial methods. Belgium has always consisted of two races andtwo languages. You may go right back to the furthest historical times and you will find that division, but it has never produced any political difficulties of a seriouscharacter. The Fleming and the Walloon have always lived side by side, and have always, or almost always, formed part of one political community, and as far asI am aware there has never been any real obstacle to their forming a homogeneouspolitical community. But the Germans, characteristically enough, are trying towork upon the fact that the languages are different, and, although there is notvery much Flemish literature, that the literature is different, and they are trying to introduce a moral split in a country which they have physically destroyed. Allthe information that reaches me-it is chiefly, I admit, from the Belgian Ministerhere, who may be taking too rosy a view of the situation but all the information get shows that the German effort is not successful. It is too openly cynical inits efforts, and I do not think it is in harmony either with the political traditionsor the present wishes of the Belgian community. I think that effort at Belgiandestruction will fail.I wish I were happier about the economic side of it. It is not a subject whichit would be, I think, appropriate to deal with at length on the present occasion,but I can describe it in a word. The country is in the main, or was, largely an industrial country. It depends therefore, like all industrial countries, upon itsmachinery, its fuel, and its raw material. The Germans are taking away everyscrap of machinery they can lay their hands on. All the raw material has been removed. It is said I do* not know whether it is said with truth, that they havemade preparations to destroy the coal mines if they are compelled to abandon thecountry. The result of that will be that when peace comes, and however it comes,we shall find Belgium a derelict country; not derelict in the way that a pastoralor an agricultural country is derelict after it has been overrun, a misfortune whichthe next harvest will almost cure, but derelict in a manner which will strain allthe efforts of Belgium&apos;s Allies to. put right. The worst of it is that unless we can provide when I say &quot;we&quot; I include, of course, America as well as the BritishEmpire the machinery, Germany will make an effort to do so, and the economicdependence of Belgium on Germany will, already threatened by Belgium sgeographical position, become, through the operation and these other economiccauses, extremely difficult to throw off. This is a problem which I believe is beingconsidered by some Departments of the Government. It is not strictly a ForeignOffice question, but the Belgian Government are constantly bringing it to me, andI thought it would be only right that I should lay before this Imperial War Cabinetthe character of one of the greatest difficulties of the smaller order which awaitus in the future.As regards Greece, I need only say that since I last attempted a survey of this character matters have enormously improved. The King, who was a mere Germantool, has been got rid of. M. Venizelos is firmly settled, and although the presentKing, partly perhaps from family affection and partly from youth and inexperience,and perhaps &quot;incapacity, does not show himself very easy to deal with, I think wemay look forward with fair confidence to the immediate future, provided M.Venizelos&apos;s life is spared. The Greeks are fighting well. They are fighting anenemy.whom they detest, and they are fighting in a country which they know, andI believe they will turn out to be useful soldiers, provided that their moral is notruined by a revolution at home. It is a one-man show, and I certainly could notanswer for the consequences if either by assassination or through the strain ofover-work M. Venizelos were incapacitated. From that point of view it is ratherserious, but otherwise I think we may count Greece among our effective Allies.I will not say anything about Serbia.
Leaving Europe I must say something about one other Ally, and that isJapan. Japan&apos;s importance in the earlier stages of the war consisted in her givingus invaluable aid in clearing the Pacific and Eastern seas of enemy raiders. since then I think the First Sea Lord will agree with me, and he knows more about itthan anybody, as he was in the Mediterranean at the time when the Japanese gave us their assistance their naval assistance, though not on a great scale, has beenreally valuable. I hope the time is very near when we may count upon assistancefrom the Japanese army. It is really a tragic reflection to think that at a timewhen man-power, especially trained man-power, is the great problem which facesthe Allies, we have among those Allies a military power which has shown itsbravery and its powers of organisation in a manner which called forth the admiral-tion of the whole world, and that nation has not sent a single^ soldier, orbeen able so far to send a single soldier, to any theatre of military opera-tions. Everybody round this table knows, and I need not dwell upon it,that the obstacle to Japan&apos;s going into Siberia, and as far as I can see theonly obstacle at this moment, lies in the fact that the arguments against intervention,which are real arguments and ought to be taken into account by every statesmandealing with the subject, those arguments weigh with the authorities at Washing-ton more than they weigh with any of the other principal Allied Powers. It isimpossible for us to move for a large variety of reasons, and particularly for one reason which is itself conclusive. I am convinced that Japan will not move on a scale commensurate to the war issues without American aid. Japan will act, Ibelieve, not only without American aid, but without anybody&apos;s aid and withoutanybody&apos;s leave as soon as she finds that she is menaced in Eastern Siberia. Shewill say, she almost has said: The Allies, those who make up the Allies, hesitate;well and good; so far as their interests are concerned, we, the Japanese, are readyto help if asked, but we won&apos;t thrust ourselves into their affairs unasked. But if in Eastern Siberia we find ourselves face to face with a German, peril then we shall take such military steps as seem to us necessary, but of course they will be confined to Eastern Siberia. I dp not say Japan says that, but that is the way I interpret the unsaid. If Japan confines herself to Eastern Siberia I will not say her inter-vention will be wholly useless, but it will not be what we want. What we want isthat she should go so far west as to be a threat to German domination in Russia.That, I believe, she will do if we can get America to throw herself heartily intothe scheme; that, I think, she will not do unless we are able to convince PresidentWilson and those whom President Wilson trusts. Personally I know there is agreat deaf of mistrust and jealousy, or fear, I ought to say, of Japan. I do notshare that mistrust or those fears so far as the immediate future is concerned, andby the immediate future I mean, let us say, the next five or ten years.. If you askwhat will happen after that, if you say to me: Have you any security that as timegoes on Japan, will not turn out to be the Prussia of the East, as many describe her,my reply is that I have no security, but I do not think it is worth our while to try to penetrate the future. For the present I believe Japan is what she professes tobe, a faithful ally, ready to do her best, within what she conceives to be reasonable limits, to aid in the common cause, and I think we can safely call upon her to co-operate with us, and that she will do so, not perhaps to the full extent which we might under certain circumstances hope for, but in a manner which will proveextremely important in redressing the balance of the war.Sir ROBERT BORDEN: What is the main objection of the United States!* Mr. BALFOUR: I can tell you the professed arguments of which the main are:Firstly, that Japan and the yellow races are unpopular in a white country, that, toallow intervention even, though it is Allied intervention, in which the Japanese will play, and must play, the main part as regards numbers, will be to alienateRussian sentiment and to drive them into the hands of Germany so that our laststate will be worse than our first, and, in our attempt to weaken the German attack in ithe East we shall, in fact, be throwing Russian sentiment on the German side and we shall find in fact that we have strengthened rather than weakened our enemies.That is one argument. The other argument is a military argument. PresidentWilson is always coming back to this point. He says: No soldier that I consult canever convince me, can ever bring arguments of a, convincing character to show that anything we can do at Vladivostok, which is; very nearly I think, 5,000 miles fromthe German frontier that anything we can do through Vladivostok and the singlerailway   which   connects   Vladivostok   with   the   West   will   really   prevent
Germany withdrawing a single division she wants to withdraw from poland, or the Ukraine, or any part of Russia, and until I am convinced that it is going to have the effect that you hope upon the military situation on the western front, I think it will be a great risk, and a useless risk, to try intervention. That isthe sort of argument which he puts forward. As you will see for these reasons he ismore ready to help in Murmansk and Archangel, where neither of these argumentsapply. He seems to have, so far, an inveterate dislike to take the line which Italy,France, and ourselves have been persistently impressing upton him for so many months now.Lord CURZON: May I remind you of the important consideration of theWestern constituencies of America?Mr. BALFOUR: I have only mentioned the main arguments. It is thoughtby many, though Lord Reading has never suggested it himself to me in any of hisletters, that the Japanese are so unpopular in California, as, of course, they are in western Canada and Northern Australia, that the President, who was on a criticaloccasion returned . by the Calif ornian vote, is unwilling to do anything so-unpopular as to send American troops under the leadership of a Japanese general.Those who really know America far better ithan I can profess to do will better beable to judge the exact weight which considerations of this kind are likely to have with the American Government at Washington,I want to say a word or two now about two neutrals. There is somethinginteresting to be said, if one had time, about almost all the neutrals, but there aretwo of especial importance of whom I think the Imperial WTar Cabinet would liketo hear.   One is Holland and the other is Spain.With regard to Norway and Sweden, as everybody round the table knows,arrangements have just been completed which I hope will put the Allied relationswith these countries on a satisfactory economic basis.Holland, however; is a constant preoccupation for us. I believe that, broadly speaking, the sentiments of her people are with the Allies. They know well enoughthat we are honestly struggling for small nationalities, and they know well enoughthey have nothing to fear from the domination of Great Britain or America, butthat they have everything to fear from the domination of Germany. While I thinkthat, on the whole, their desires are for an Allied victory, their Eastern frontieris open to German attacks. Their army, I am told, is of very good material, but;t is ill-equipped with certain necessary elements in a modern army, they have noheavy guns and they have no aeroplanes. There will be no difficulty, our military advisers tell us, in Germany over-running Holland, at least up to the water defences,and even the water defences probably would not very long withstand a german attack. Whatever we may say about the brutality of German methods, and the merenarrative of them makes our blood boil, it has been successful up to a point. Ibelieve it to be extremely bad policy in the long run, but I do not think it has beenbad policy, especially if you consider merely the immediate necessities /and theimmediate ambitions of Germany and Holland with the example of Belgium on hervery borders. Holland naturally shrinks from the policy of becoming the victim of similar treatment herself. While,, therefore, Holland is mortally afraid of war withGermany, we, looking at the problem from our side, feel, at the present time at all events, very ill-provided with the means of adequately defending Holland. earlier in the war a certain number of troops were allotted in order to be rapidly sent toWalcheren in case of a German attack. Everybody knows the strain upon our men;how difficult it is to send large bodies of troops into Holland, and Ido not think we can expect Holland to take a bold line against german pressure until the military situation changes in. our favour. If thingsgo really well with us, which may not be very long hence, if the balance of numbers were to alter on the Western front in our favour, if Germany had to say toherself; well whatever happens to us we dare not bring in 800,000 or 400,000 addi-tional trained Dutch troops against us. and if Holland thought that the allies had troops to spare, then I think a very different complexion might come over thediplomacy of the situation and the task of the Foreign Office would be much less em-barrassingthanitisatthe present time. At the present time we are constantly brought up against problems of very great difficulty. We cannot allow Holland to do grosslyunneutral acts in favour of Germany. At the same time we cannot say to Holland:If in consequence of your retaining your neutrality you require our assistance youshall have ijt, because I have just explained we are not in a position to give assistance on a large scale at the present time.   Neither can we say to Holland: If you cannot[543-4] C
maintain your neutrality we shall, of course, have to treat you as an enemy. Thatwould be not only a repulsive policy ito us from a sentimental point of view, but itwould be extremely dangerous from a naval point of view, because, while our military advisers tell us that we cannot effectively, at the present time, defend Hollandagainst German attacks, our naval advisers tell us that if Holland were really to fall under the control of Germany, if the Estuary of the Scheldt and the Dutohports were really to come under German control, the task of the Admiralty in protecting British commerce against submarine attack would be almost intolerablyburdensome. Our position therefore is one of very great difficulty, and over thesand and gravel question), of which most of you have heard, and over a more recentdevelopment connected with the Limburg Railway, and over other analogousquestions, we have had most anxious and indeed painful negotiations with Holland,who, from our point of view, has not always behaved well, but whose difficulties, Ithink, after what I have said, everybody round this table will thoroughly realise.Spain is in a different position, because Spain cannot be attacked effectively byGermany, in fact, Spain cannot be attacked at all. Her territorial-waters might bemore flagrantly invaded than they are by German submarines;, but even if theGermans showed even less respect for Spanish territorial waters, I do not see, fromthat point of view, that the position of Spain would be much worse than it is to-day.The importance of Spain from our point of view is not its military importance, but its economic. No doubt Spain is dependent upon the Allies, for coal and cereals, but weare dependent, so I understand from the Minister of Munitions, upon Spain forcertain essentials for our armies. We must have iron ore and we must have the materials out of- which sulphuric acid is made, also pyrites, which is a. sulphate of iron, we must have that in order to cany on the day to day work of munition making.That, in one sense, puts us i, you may almost say, in the hands of Spain. She could,if she wished, squeeze us very seriously; on the other hand, the power of the allies to squeeze her is so formidable, and I think I may go further, I think the friendlysentiments of the King and the greater part of the people are so clear in their view as tfo the interests of Spain, that they realise that Spain in the long run must beon the side of the Western Powers, and that they cannot permanently afford toquarrel with the nations who hold the domination of the seas. This makes mefairly happy about our future relations with that country. I am very anxious thatthe Departments concerned, should now begin to rival the Germans in taking steps in Spain for seeing that after the war Spanish resources are. still going to be a tour disposal. That is outside the immediate province of the Foreign Office, and inany case I should not have time to deal with the complicated, subject on an occasionlike the present.   I think that is all I need say about the Allies and neutrals.There is a country which is neither an ally nor a neutral, but about which i must siay something, and that is Russia.. The position in Russia is absolutelyunexampled in the history of the world. It is an amazing reflection, I think, if youcast back your mind four or four-and-a-half years you would have said Englandis a great naval Power, but has no ambitions and no capacity to become a greatmilitary Power; and you would have said: Russia is a military Power. With itscentral organisation, its enormous army, and its freedom from the difficulties whichsometimes beset free countries; it is an. Empire made for war and made for nothing else; it is a military Empire; and only a military Empire. If you had said that in four years you would find that Russia could not defend herself against Finland, andthat the British Empire had an army of four or five million men you would have said that the greatest paradoxical prophecy could not go further. That is what has actually happened. If you want to add to the paradox it is this, that whereas whenthe war broke out Russia might be regarded, and was regarded, as thegreat enemy of free institutions, the great exemplar of what autocracycould do, &quot;and then when that autocracy fell the greatest blow everdelivered against the cause of freedom was delivered by the revolutionarysuccessors of that autocracy, you would feel that that gave us the mostsurprising of the surprises which history, as it unrolls itself, is always presentingto our gaze. I was fool enough when I last addressed the Imperial War Cabinetabout a year ago to hazard a prophecy. I said that, however badly the RevolutionaryGovernment was likely to manage the war, at all events it would manage it betterthan the autocracy had managed it. There never was a more lamentable forecastmade in the history of the world. Who could foresee that the Russian Government,not beginning, mark you, with the Soviets, but beginning with Kerenski, would setitself deliberately to work:to destroy the army, and succeed in doing so? It wasKerenski who abolished capital punishment.   I admit that other people have done
on a grand scale what Kerenski did on a small scale, but between them they have socontrived it that the only obstacles at this moment to the Germans doing what theylike and going where they like in the country are the distances to be traversed, thedefectiveness of the communications, the difficulty of obtaining food, and the dangerof disease. Russia itself can do nothing and does nothing against them, and oneafter another they have given up every power of resisting the action of Germany,so that if the war were to end at this moment Germany would find herself in controlof all the Russian supplies with a door open through the Black Sea to the East, withthe Black Sea itself turned from a Russian lake into a German lake, and Russiacut off from the West by Finland and that series of independent States which she hasbeen creating right down to the Black Sea,, a Russia, as far as we can see, with no power whatever of reaction, as the doctors say, against the disease. Everybody whom see from Russia, whatever1 view they take about intervention says that withoutintervention the Russians can do. nothing and will do nothing. It is an amazingand humiliating consideration. It is the lowest depth to which a great country has ever fallen in less than eighteen months, and the problem presented to us is not onlyformidable in its magnitude, but formidable through its absolute novelty. We haven(o experience to go by; the reports you get of the state of Russia, though they agree in certain broad outlines, never agree as regards the particular-facts. One ofthe ablest men from Russia came to see me recently, and I was complaining to him of this state of affairs. He said it is perfectly true; you not only get different reports from different parts of the country, but from the same small district you getabsolutely contradictory reports from two witnesses;, both of whom appear, as far as you can judge, to be trustworthy. The diplomacy of such a problem is exceedingly difficult, if not impossible. There are only two- things I can see that we can do inRussia; one, which I have already referred to, is intervention, and that depends onthe Americans. The other is partly what we can do at Murmansk and Archangel.I will not dwell upon that because: it is more a military problem than one with whichI am concerned, but I think I must say both from my colleagues and myself that it is causing us great anxiety because our powers of sending troops there are limited, notonly in regard to our finding men but still more in1 regard to our finding tonnage, andwe do not know what fotroes can be brought against us. Rumours pile up of thousandsupon thousands of Germans and Finns and White Guards and all the rest of them whoare prepared to attack that coast and drive us off and establish submarine baseswhich would shut off the North of Russia from Allied intervention as the East ofRussia is shut off by the German Armies and the South of Russia is shut off by the black Sea and the German and Turkish navies. If that happens this huge country will be hermetically sealed to1) Western influence except through the enormouslyroundabout method of going through Vladivostok and by thousands of miles of single railway which connect Vladivostok with the West. I shall be pleased to answer any further questions about Russia, but that seems to me to be the mainoutline of a most unpleasant situation,Me. ROW ELL: What is the attitude of the so-called Soviet Government?Mr. BALFOUR: That is a question which is well worth asking, but is not easy to answer. When the Bolshevists started their wild career they genuinely believed,I think, or at all events Lenin genuinely believed, that they could bring the war toan end by starting a Bolshevist Revolution in Germany and Austria to begin with,to be followed up by a Bolshevist Revolution in Great Britain, France, Italy, India,Egypt, and no doubt ultimately in Canada, and the United States of America. Thatwas. their ambition,. but they have had a rude awakening. I have no doubt that among them are subordinate Germ am agents who are simply paid by Germany. I donot think Lenin is paid&apos; by Germany, but I am not quite so sure about some ofLenin&apos;s important colleagues. I have on more than one occasion spoken to&apos; Mr.Lockhart who is now in Moscow carrying on under great difficulties our diplomatic relations, such as they are, with the Soviet Government. I ought to say that at onetime Mr. Lockhart was a more enthusiastic supporter of the JBolshevists than he isnow. I have put to him on more than one occasion this question: Can you tell me asingle thing which the German General Staff would like the Russian Governmentto do which the Soviet Government has not done? He has never- taken up the.challenge, and though I am\ not by any means certain that this subservience toGermany, this falling in with and almost anticipating Germany&apos;s wishes, is due tosheer straightforward corruption, I do not exclude that possibility. Whether thatis the fact or not, the fact is, as I have stated, that.many of the things they havedone could not have been forced upon them by the Germans.     For example, the
sabandonment of the Black Sea Fleet. The Germans had no fleet there, the russians had overwhelming power- in the Black Sea. Yet they have allowed the Russian fleet to be taken with the result that I have communicated to the Imperial War Cabinet,namely, that, the Black Sea is now a German lake, and Germany can land troops, andhas landed troops, in Trans-Caucasia, with the possibility of extending her line ofpenetration not only from the Black Sea and through Trans-Caucasia, but over the.Caspian and into the very heart of Central Asia. That is one example, and therewas no earthly military power or naval power which could have made the Sovietsdo this. It was either sheer incompetence carried to an almost incredible degree, orabsolute treachery and corruption. As you have asked me about the Soviet let me.say this: I gather that, as might be expected, their power is waning. Their poweronly came into existence because apparently the other classes in Russia wereabsolutely incapable of joining together.to oppose them. I was told yesterday byMr. Bagge, who was our consul for years in Odessa, and who has just comeback, that there were five thousand officers, I think, in Moscow who, if they had beenunited, could have stopped the whole thing. The same applied in Petrograd. but every class and every party in Russia seems stricken with paralysis; whether it israce, Or whether it is generations of autocratic government, or what the cause maybe I know not, but when the Bolshevists, the majority of the leaders among who mare Jews not Russians, got the thing in hand, although I do not think they haveshown statesmanship at all, nevertheless they have made decisions. If anybody hitsthem they hit back as hard as ever they can. The result is that although they arelosing in power at this moment, they are still ,the only, or almost the only, power in Russia. Siberia is said to be getting restless. Still the Bolshevists are almost theonly power in Russia which is to be counted with. They have not only taken private property and in that sense become a socialist State, but they do not know how to manage private property or private enterprise at all. They have got no money andno prospect of getting money. They have shown no power of organising the means,of transport, with the result that Central and Northern Russia, which cannotsupport itself even in good times, is largely dependent upon the South and has begun to starve. And then there is this all-important point to be remembered. I am told that if you speak to a Russiam peasant or Russian supporter of the Revolution he says: Well, the Cadets came into office when the autocracy was abolished. Theypromised this, (that, and the other, but they did nothing. Following the Cadets cameKerenski and his party, who, I think, called themselves Social Revolutionists. Theypromised us peace and also land. We got neither peace nor land. The Bolshevistscame into office. They promised us peace and they gave us peace, or at all events we thought they gave us peace, and we certainly got the land. Then if you go on to say:Well, the Bolshevists are failing, you will get the reply: Yes they are failing now,then we shall go back to the autocracy.   That is what Mr. Bagge told me yesterday.THE PRIME MINISTER: Does he think they will go back to the autocracy?Mr. BALFOUR: He thinks the peasants will.Mr. COOK: Who have they got?Mr. BALFOUR: He was very vague about that, and I do not much trust theseprophecies, but his stories about the temperament of the people are really extra-ordinary. They seem almost born for servitude. While everybody is nice andgood-natured under this Bolshevist rule, there is no sort of discipline or socialco-ordination at all. The way he put it was that all the porters of the houseslolled about and came in when they liked and did what they liked. Suddenly therewas a rumour that the Germans were advancing and were some hundreds of miles off. These porters at once became respectful, and they touched their hats when their chiefs came in. Another case he cited was that he knew of peasants whohad robbed a big landlord in their neighbourhood of his land and burned his house and destroyed his cattle: They heard that the Germans were coming and theyimmediately brought forward, as he told me, a very large sum in roubles, and presented it to this man and begged him to come and live among them again.Thejr are absolutely like children, but I do not think they will ever go in for the bolshevist theories of Socialism. I do not quite know what their theories are;they are very difficult accurately to describe. In one case I got a translation,issued in a Russian town, in which Socialism took the form of declaring all thewomen to be held in common. I do not think at Moscow they have got that lengthyet. The peasant is quite determined that the landlord shall not have it, but thathe himself shall keep his own. That is not the Bolshevist theory, which is thatthe peasants&apos; land should belong to the State.
Mr. HUGHES: Their theory is the stronger one.Mr. BALFOUR: Some observers believe, as you would expect in a completelyignorant country where most of the people can neither read nor write, the localpriest, who can more or less read and write, is gradually getting back his power in the villages.THE PRIME MINISTER: He is not a good type.Mr. BALFOUR: No, he is a poor type. The peasants are beginning to con-gregate around them and coalesce for the purpose of getting provisions, and thereis the danger of this kind of organisation spreading. Therefore we must try, ifwe can, to give them something to crystallize round. Something which will prevent this orgy of impotence which is now going on, and I do not think that canbe done without intervention.Mr. COOK: Is there any danger of Germany making some of these peoplefight?Mr. BALFOUR : That is one of the great perils I foresee. The German,luckily, has a most extraordinary tendency for making himself abominated inevery country where, he sets foot, and that is our salvation; otherwise, look whatopportunities he has. You talk of his military position and of his having interiorlines; look what an enormous advantage interior lines are for the purpose ofpenetration. The one thing that you can buy a Russian soul for at this momentare the boots, the clothes, and the other things of which he has been absolutelydeprived since the war began, and of which he is in urgent need, and for which heis prepared to exchange his corn. But he is not prepared to exchange his cornfor worthless paper roubles. One would naturally say that the proper thing to dois to try and effect a penetration into Russia, not merely a military penetration,but a commercial one; but the difficulties are extraordinary. We have sent out a big mission, included in which are a great many commercial people, and I think the Americans are also going to try to do something in this direction. Luckily forus the Germans who could give gold for corn, cannot give boots, because they haveno boots for themselves. If Germany could produce in time of war what she pro-duces in time of peace, I believe she would have the whole country at her feet. she would be master of their resources, and they would look to her for everything they want. We can produce some of the things she wants, but we cannot get themthere, or only in small quantities.Mr. ROWELL: I suppose the Greek Church is impotent.Mr. BALFOUR: The Greek Church is low in the scale of civilisation, but theRussian is religious by temperament.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN: It is rather a remarkable thing that since the fall ofautocracy and the rise of Bolshevism, the patriarchate has anathematised theBolsheviks.Mr. BALFOUR: I am told that the weakness of the Russian Church in itsopposition to the Bolsheviks lies in the fact that they are regarded as merelyfighting for their own land and their own goods. They, more than any-body else, have been corrupted by autocracy. They became almost an instrument of State, they were managed by what they call the Holy Synod, the Chairman ofwhich was a layman appointed by the Czar. The Greek Cnurch in no part of theworld, I think, can compare with the Western Churches, whether Protestant orRoman Catholic, and it is worse in Russia than anywhere, owing to its subservienceto autocracy for all these years. There may be a revival of some sort, but thequestion is how soon and what direction will it take.Mr. HUGHES: Does what you have said apply to the great Russians or tothe whole of Russia, and is there any hope at all in Russia other than that peopledby what you call the true great Russians, of setting up something in the form ofGovernment which will ultimately control the others?Mr. BALFOUR: That is a most important question, and a very interestingone. What I am afraid is happening is that out of the Empire which we used toknow as the Russian Empire will be carved a certain number of States along thewestern side, and a State in Siberia on the eastern side, leaving a sort of morass,a huge, flat, moving, unsolid mass, in. the middle. You.see it is on the western side.[543-4] D
that Western civilisation has affected Russia. It is on the western side that racesmore vigorous than the great Russians are to be found, the Finns, the Letts, theLithuanians, the Poles, the little Russians, and some elements in South Russia, alsothe Siberian, who is more or less of a mixed race, and a descendant of exiles, andwho possesses a great deal of the vigorous Russian elements.THE PRIME MINISTER : The Georgians are a fine type, too.Mr. BALFOUR : Yes, the Georgians and also the Armenians. They have all got a tinge of Western culture, of Western blood, and of Western vigour, andthen you have got those endless morasses belonging to the Slavs all that centralflat part of Russia which has never produced a great man, and which apparentlyis totally without inherent or internal vigour: you do not know what to make ofthis ringed centre, and it is a most tremendous problem. Let me say this, because this touches questions in which we are concerned; if we had to reconstitute at this moment the map of Europe according to our wishes, which should we like to see,the old Russian Empire reconstituted with, broadly speaking, its old limits, ofcourse under free institutions, or should we like to see vigorous smaller nation-Personalities a ring of smaller nationalities round the outside or should we like to seeassociated in confederation those smaller nationalities with this great inert massin the middle? I am not quite sure which is for our interest. I do not suppose that it will turn out that we shall be able to control the evolution of events, but ifwe could control it, I am not quite clear in what direction I would steer. How-ever, these are tremendous speculations.Mr. HUGHES : What is the policy of the Foreign Office in regard to Russia ?In what way are we trying to rehabilitate it? Is there some man or some menwho have the capacity of leadership, who can get a sufficient force of men who willlight and who will wake these dreamers up?Mr, balfour: We have not found him; if we could find him we wouldback him. Broadly speaking, our policy, since everything went to pieces, hasbeen to say : We refuse to intervene in the internal controversies of Russia; theinternal controversies of Russia are for the Russians to decide, but wherever we find any body who is prepared to fight Germans we back him.THE PRIME MINISTER : Wherever we found anybody who looked like aman.Sir ROBERT BORDEN : What about the Czecho-Slovaks in Siberia; is thereanything new about them?Mr, BALFOUR : That looks as if it might be a great tragedy. Here are avery line body of men, numbering I suppose roughly 50,000 to 60,000, some ofthem have reached Vladivostok, some of them echelonned along the railway, fighting,as far as I can discover, with German prisoners who call themselves Bolshevists.You have the people at Moscow first trying to have them disarmed, and now try-ing to negotiate with them, but I do not think they have any power for negotiating,and I do not think the Czechs would allow themselves to be disarmed. Thatagain is a question that would be solved if we could intervene, and as the PrimeMinister and my colleagues know quite well, some weeks ago I earnestly pressedthat we should use these Czechs in Russia, and I think if it had rested with theBritish Government alone, an attempt would have been made in that direction.The French, however, insisted that they should be taken to the Western front as fast as tonnage would allow, and the Czechs themselves are very anxious to get outof Russia. They will not lend themselves to that policy; but I think they would if they could be persuaded that that was the way to kill Germans. They are veryunwilling to be dragged and quite rightly so into these domestic controversiesin Russia.Mr. COOK: Have you any idea what men like General Alexeieff and General&quot;Korniloff are doing?Mr. BALFOUR: In a feeble way I believe they are trying to get Cossacksto help us.Mr. BONAR LAW: I heard that General Korniloff is dead.Mr. BALFOUR : Undoubtedly the strongest man in Russia is a man whowas once Minister of War, General Savinkoff.
1161Sir ROBERT BORDEN : I suppose there is a danger of the Germans induc-ing these people to put in a Government still more favourable to them if that ispossible.Mr. BALFOUR: The danger is twofold. First there is the danger asregards the welfare of the educated classes, and secondly there is the danger asregards the uneducated classes. As regards the danger of the educated classes,they say : We do hate the Germans, but if nobody will help us we will go to whom we choose. They want security, and after all, security is bread and life, and much as they hate the Germans, the Germans will give them what they want,and the Allies won&apos;t. The danger as regards the uneducated classes is somewhat different. I always have a fear lest when the pinch of starvation and hunger getsmore acute the Germans will be able to get as much labour as they like by saying :Come to Germany and you will be fed. Luckily they have not too much food for themselves, but still there is an unlimited reservoir of labour if they can use it,and under the stress of suffering I am not sure that they will not be able to do so.Mr. MASSEY: Are there any indications that the pinch will be severely feltduring next winter from the point of view of scarcity of food?Mr. BALFOUR : Yes.Lord MILNER: Do you not regard the Siberian grain stocks as more or lessa decisive factor, if whoever gets control of them can feed the Russians?Mr. BALFOUR: Yes, I think they are. In Western Siberia there are probablylarge supplies. To the Germans and to the Austrians the Ukraine has been amost bitter disappointment. I presume that the newspapers are right when they say that the bread ration in Austria is to be reduced.The other thing the Imperial War Cabinet would probably like to know some-thing about is the relations of our enemies to peace, if you do not think it is gettingtoo late.THE PRIME MINISTER: I think that must be treated as a separatequestion.General SMUTS: It might even be advisable to set up a small committee toconsider the matter, and thus treat the subject of peace quite separately by itself.Mr. MONTAGU: The Foreign Secretary has not dealt with the enemy countries at all, and I wonder if he could tell us in a few words anything aboutthe present political conditions in Germany and Austria.THE PRIME MINISTER: That is another matter.Mr. COOK: A discussion in regard to peace would be most welcome.Mr. BALFOUR: I think you are probably right that it should be put off.Mr. CHURCHILL: I should like to know if the cordial assent of the UnitedStates is an indispensable preliminary to getting the Japanese into Siberia. is there no means of substituting for the formal assent of the United States some extra support or guarantee to Japan by Great Britain that if she goes on we will support her? If we are to be held up by the difficulty of convincing PresidentWilson, month after month will go by and we shall be worse off than we are even now. As the Americans get more and more drawn into the struggle on the&apos; western front it is quite possible that they would come round to Japanese intervention moreafter the event, once it has taken place, even though they were not committed to taking the responsibility of the decision at the commencement.Mr., BALFOUR: I think it is possible, as I have already indicated to theCabinet, that the Japanese in their own interests may make a limited intervention,and that having made a limited intervention they will grow and expand into a fuller intervention, which is what we really require, but if you ask me whether wecan attempt to go on without the Americans on the bigger scale I rather think wecannot for two reasons. I do not think Japan would do it. Japan wants american assistance in material and in finance. It is conceivable that you might get roundthat, but it is not very easy to see how you could do so. The finances of the BritishEmpire, as the Chancellor of the Exchequer knows, are not overflowing in ourcoffers.   Italy and France are absolutely dependent upon America and upon our-
selves, and if you say: Well, won&apos;t America indirectly subsidise the Japanesethrough us, I should greatly doubt whether the Americans would consent to that procedure. It would be rather a thin example of camouflage, which I do notthink would commend itself at Washington. They would like to do it openly ornot at all. Another argument which would be really very strong is that it isperfectly notorious that this is a subject of anxious and difficult deliberation amongthe Allies, and that it has been so for months. If America does not come in every-body will say: There is a split; the Allies no longer are acting as one body with one policy, and all the dangers which President Wilson anticipates, all the feeling against the yellow races will be enormously accentuated, because everybody inRussia will say: Why are not the Americans coming in? If the Americans willnot come in, they will reply to their own question that it is because they object tothis invasion of the yellow man into the white man&apos;s country; that they think this is an attack upon Russian independence and upon Russian development, andfor that reason they are standing aloof, because of a procedure to which they havemoral objections. I think that would have a really most disastrous effect uponthe whole expedition. America is now not only the largest and wealthiest of theAllies, but the one nearest the scene of action, and the one to whom this intervention in Siberia should commend itself on military grounds.Mr: HUGHES: How long is it since you heard President Wilson&apos;s views?They are probably frequently changing. Why I ask that question is this: when was in New York and in Washington I met the Committee on Foreign Relations,which had been entrusted with the duty of advising President Wilson on thisquestion.Mr. BALFOUR: Was this the Committee of the Senate or of the Cabinet?Mr. HUGHES: The Cabinet Committee, and their view then was distinctlyin favour of a joint operation; there was no suggestion whatever against such an operation, but they certainly did not give me the impression in fact, they said soplainly probably that arose out of what I said about Japan that they were notin favour of Japan operating herself.Mr. BALFOUR: We are all agreed that Japan should not operate alone.Mr. HUGHES: Doctor Schlesinger and the other members of the Committeewere distinctly in favour of a joint operation.Mr. BALFOUR: This is extraordinary information, and quite new.Sir ROBERT BORDEN: I think Colonel House is the Chairman of this Com-mittee.Lord MILNER: Who are the members?Mr. HUGHES: I cannot remember their names at the moment, but I willsupply you with them this afternoon.Mr. BALFOUR: If it interests anyone, of course it is open to anyone present to see what our procedure in the matter has been, and in this connection I amhaving a summary made in the Foreign Office of our action in the matter.Mr. HUGHES: The impression I formed in talking to these men was that thematter had not been pushed as one of the first importance. It was being treated as one of several questions. For example, it did not, from what I gathered from them,seem of greater urgency than the question of the Pacific, and, indeed, we discussedit together.   They were to present an Interim Report in a day or two.Mr. BALFOUR: That may have some effect on the Presidents mind.Mr. HUGHES: I met a number of men there, and amongst othersDr. Nicholas Murray Butler, who is either a member of that Committee or in close touch with them, and he.was distinctly favourable to intervention. He is, I believe,a Republican, but the majority of those with whom I spoke are Democrats, and Ithink the President will practically follow what they say. It is of the utmost possible importance to get into touch with this Committee, because, after all, thePresident will follow what they say.Mr. BALFOUR: Do you see any objection to my mentioning this to lord reading?  He has not given us a single word about it.
Mr. HUGHES: I have no objection.Mr. COOK: I take it, Mr. Balfour, that you have definitely pressed for a combined expedition?Mr. BALFOUR: Yes, in the strongest way.Sir ROBERT BORDEN: I have some personal knowledge of that. I happened to be in Washington at the end of February, and went with Lord Reading on theoccasion when he saw President Wilson. I saw him in Ottawa a few weeks before I left, and he told me that the negotiations had been going on almost withoutintermission.THE PRIME MINISTER: I wonder whether it would help matters if we hada request sent from the Imperial War Cabinet to Lord Reading saying that we had discussed the matter here, and intimating the importance attached to it by therepresentatives of the Dominions?Mr. BALFOUR: You see, President Wilson knows, not merely that the british war Cabinet  I admit not the Imperial War Cabinet is strongly for it, but he knows that the French Cabinet is for it, and the Italian Cabinet also.THE PRIME MINISTER: You must remember that the action taken by M,Clemenceau in regard to the Czecho-Slovaks at our last meeting at Versailles would weaken that impression, and I noticed that Mr. Frazier at once took note of the factthat M. Clemenceau attached more importance to the Czecho-Slovaks than to japanese intervention.Mr. BONAR LAW: Did we ever get the strongly worded message fromGeneral Foch that we hoped to get as to the military position?GENERAL WILSON: M. Clemenceau would not let him do it.Mr. LONG: Our own Chief of Staff has laid great stress on it.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN: A suggestion made by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs might have some weight with the President. The Secretary of Statepointed out that it was extremely probable that the German penetration wouldthreaten what the Japanese consider the individual interest of Japan, and in that case Japan would act with or without our leave, and probably without consultation,in defence of her own interests. In that case her action would be limited to EasternSiberia with two consequences: first of all, that she gives the minimum assistance tothe Allies by her intervention, and secondly that the intervention takes place in that part of Asia about which the Americans are most sensitive, and where the presenceof the Japanese would be most Offensive. I think it would be worth while to put thatargument before President Wilson, if it has not already been done.Mr. BALFOUR:  I might put it again, but it has already been done, more than once.Sir ROBERT BORDEN: It would be far better to have Japan to go in withthe other Allies under an obligation to withdraw, than to go in solely on her own account.Mr. CHURCHILL: Have we actually put it to the Japanese that if the UnitedStates agree, but were not prepared to give any cordial or active support, would theyconsider any way in which we could assist them?Mr. BALFOUR: I ought, perhaps, to say that this has given me some anxiety.At Versailles it was decided that we should, as it were, reverse our method of opera-tions. What we had been doing up to that time was saying to America: Will youassent to come in with us? If you will we think we can get the Japanese in. at versailles we decided to reverse the operation, and I was instructed by my foreigncolleagues there to say to the Japanese: Now then, will you come in if America comesin? If you will tell us you will come in, then we will put pressure on America. I atonce sent for the Japanese Ambassador here, and, as my colleagues already know, Igave him an aide-memoire in which I set the question out so that there would be nomistake, and he at once telegraphed it out, but got no answer; that is the curiousthing.Sir ROBERT BORDEN: I saw that; that is several days ago.[543--4J If!   \ .,        ; \     E .
Mr. BALFOUR: Of course, I have remonstrated with the japanese ambassador, but all he can say is he believes it is merely a proof of the very careful examination which the Japanese Government are giving to a very big proposition;but that, does not leave me wholly satisfied.THE PRIME MINISTER: My attention has been drawn to some very interesting communications in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; from Japan, which seem toindicate that Japan is rather excited about intervention, and there is a big feeling in favour of it, but you can see that it has become a political question there, andthere is one party which is very insistent upon there being no intervention, excepta joint one, as they are afraid of any quarrel with the United States of America. Ithink it would be worth while making another effort in the name of the imperial war Cabinet. At any rate it would furnish a new excuse for again approachingPresident Wilson; he has been very obstinate about it, but if there is this convergingpressure coming from this Committee in the United States of America, I think itwould be a good thing to approach him again.Mr. BALFOUR: There is a telegram which I have to answer to-day, andwhich, I think, you have seen, which shows that President Wilson is still consideringit, and that he has not shut the door. If the Imperial War Cabinet desire it, I willsend an entirely separate telegram showing that the matter was fully considered bythe Imperial War1 Cabinet, and that they were extremely anxious that the policy should be carried out.Mr. BONAR LAW: I suggest that the message be a direct message from theImperial War Cabinet to President Wilson, and not sent in the ordinary formthrough the State Department.Mr. COOK: Would President Wilson like us to go on without his being included?Mr. BALFOUR: I do not think he would like that; I think he must come inhimself.Sir ROBERT BORDEN: We should be faced with all the disadvantages you have already mentioned.THE PRIME MINISTER: If you go on without President Wilson it wouldbe bad.Mr. COOK: But for political reasons he might like it himself.Mr. BALFOUR: On the whole I think the balance would be the other way.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN: It would not be as if you were acting before you hadknowledge of his views; to act in defiance of his views is a very different thing.LORD MILNER: I feel doubtful about the President saying &quot; I disapproveof it &quot;; I think he is hesitating.THE PRIME MINISTER: He sent a direct message to his military representative at Versailles practically ordering him not to take any part in theconsideration of this question. This document was shown to. me; it was veryemphatic, and there is absolutely no&apos; doubt about it at all, and General Bliss told mehe could not take any part in considering this problem. He was very sorry, because he is disposed the other way. But President Wilson is against it, and at one time itwas a very great gamble. It might have thrown Russia into the arms of Germany,and that would have been a very formidable thing. Take Poland, for instance,Germany has been in occupation of Poland for two or three years, but is not gettingany men out of that country. But if you forced Russia to declare war on Japan, andhad American, British, and French troops in the army, and the Russians attacked, itis the beginning of war against the alliance. It is a thing that requires very carefulconsideration.Mr. MASSEY: There are more sides than one.Sir ROBERT BORDEN: Is there a separate Government in Siberia?Mr. BALFOUR: There are the beginnings of it, and there are suggestions thatSiberia does not like the Soviets.Mr. MASSEY: There was one for some time, and then the Bolshevists knockedit out.   We have received information that they are now trying to re-establish it.
THE PRIME MINISTER: Before we separate, I should like, on behalf of theimperial War Cabinet, to send a message of congratulation to the Italians. I think they would be rather pleased, and it would cheer them up, and support them.Mr. CHURCHILL: Perhaps you would mention Lord Cavan&apos;s name in it?THE PRIME MINISTER: Has there been no reference in the newspapersto the fact that Lord Cavan is now in command of our troops in Italy? The Germansalways make a point of giving publicity to the names of their generals who are doing well, and, I think, Lord Cavan&apos;s name should be mentioned.LORD MILNER: I had not the least idea that it was not generally known.THE PRIME MINISTER: I do not think the general public know it, andLord Cavan is a very good soldier.Mr. WALTER LONG: He did brilliantly in that attack the other day.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN: In your message to the Italian Government, I supposeyou will introduce into it some words making allusion to the British troops.THE PRIME MINISTER: &quot; Accompanied with the Franco-British troops.&quot;You must not make too much of that; there are only five British divisions there outof fifty-four, and you must not give the impression that they have really done it.Mr. HUGHES: We have been now some four years at war, and I do not knowwhether the information is available, but I should certainly like to know what arethe precise results as regards casualties, and the reasons which led up to the strategywhich has expressed itself in different offensives and in different battles on thedifferent fronts. As far as Australia is concerned of course, I speak only for her we have never had the scratch of a pen to tell us anything about this. We havepoured the men into this machine, and we have lost a great number. That is, ofcourse, quite true of everybody else, but I am merely speaking for myself. I thinkthat it is quite1 futile to be asked to express any opinion as to the war situation,because, after all, from the admirable review of the present situation, as set forth byGeneral Wilson and Mr. Balfour, nothing could be finer, and nothing more completethan what we have heard; but the whole thing is apparently turned on the situation on the Western front. Diplomacy, what is it? It is hamstrung. Although Mr.Balfour does not tell us so, practically speaking, Japan is waiting to see what willhappen before she decides whether she will go into Siberia. What happens on theWestern front after all is what the brain at the head of affairs directs, and, shortly,what we want to know is: Are the men that we are pouring into this machine, themen who are dying, the men who are suffering, are they being properly led? Is the strategy as good as it possibly can be? If there have been blunders, at the eleventhhour can we&apos; repair them?&apos; I do not suggest that there have been blunders, I do not say so at all, because i know nothing whatever about it, except that for four yea;rs we have been hammeringaway, and we are now where we were before the Battle of the Marne, and, perhaps,worse, because then we had tremendous potential resources which we had notmarshalled, and thus we were well on the way. But up to this time, what has happened? The Germans have conducted military operations, which have been almost universally successful, and have failed only to break right through theWestern front; they have done everything else. We have, of course, had some success in Mesopotamia, and Palestine. Therefore, I think, it would be a good thing if a return or some memorandum could be furnished reviewing comprehensively the whole situation.  Whether this is possible or not I do not pretend to say.THE PRIME MINISTER: That leads up to the discussion initiated by sir robert Borden, in which Mr. Massey, General Smuts, and Mr. Lloyd took part,following largely on the same lines as Sir Robert Borden. I do not know whether mr. Hughes has anything further to say on that subject. If not, I was going tosuggest that, say, the Prime Ministers, with General Smuts as the representative ofSouth Africa and representing General Botha, should have a discussion on thequestions raised by Sir Robert Borden, and again raised by Mr. Hughes, and thatany conclusions we may come to, or any recommendations we may be prepared to make,should come up for discussion before the Imperial War Cabinet. I think, however,,that it would be desirable that we should have a preliminary discussion with theSecretary of State for War, and, when necessary, with the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff.  I think the sooner we meet to discuss this question the better.
Sm ROBERT BORDEN: I think the sooner the better by all means. . Theconditions at the front are such that we do not know when the thunderbolt will fall.The question at present is as to whether man-power will permit us to throwanother division, or part of a division, into any particular part of the line. That,as I understand, is only temporary, during, say, the next sixty days, after which theChief of the Imperial General Staff tells us that the anxiety, will to some extent passaway, provided that the lines now held by the Allies on the Western front sub-stantially remain the same as at present. I am anxious to take that matter up, and,as a matter of fact, I have decided to leave to two of my colleagues the work of theImperial Conference, and to devote myself, so far as I may be of any assistance, tothe consideration of this question.Mr. COOK: It would have a good effect on the war atmosphere in the Dominionsif a joint statement could be made.(It was decided that the First Meeting of the above Committee should be held to-morroio in the Prime Minister &apos;s Room at 10, Downing Street, at 12 noon.)2, Whitehall Gardens,20th June, 1918.o
