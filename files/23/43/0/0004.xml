SIR ROBERT BORDEN : Prime Minister, you asked us to make a statement ofthe war activities in the Dominions since we last met. So far as Canada is concernedI shall put this in very summary form. When we were here last year the total enlist-ments for the Canadian Expeditionary Force were 403,000; up to the 31st May of thisyear they were 513,729. At that time we had despatched overseas 300,262 ; up to the31st May this year we have despatched 378,477 men. A year ago we had in France125,465 men ; on the 31st May of this year we had 160,222 men. Our casualties atthat time were 78,291; on the 31st May of this year they were between 152,000 and154,000. We sent from Great Britain to France from the 1st March, 1917, to the 3lstMay, 1918, 130,696 men to replace wastage and to increase the forces. Since we methere last year an enactment for compulsory military service has become law in Canada,and under that law we have enlisted up to the 23rd May 64,535 men. In May wesecured in all over 37,886 men ; probably 70,000 to 75,000 men have been obtainedunder the Military Service Act up to the end of that month. In addition to these wehave secured in the United States 18,000 men.THE PRIME MINISTER: Have you secured many French Canadians from theStates ?SIR ROBERT BORDEN : Very few.   Up to the 31st May, 1918, the total of all ranks who have been sent overseas amounts to 378,477.   The men who have gone from canada to Imperial naval and military forces, and as French, Russian, and Italianreservists, number at least 27,050.   Some 13,345 Canadians have joined the Air Forces.   II believe at the moment there are more than 10,000 Canadians in the Air Services.With respect to the enforcement of compulsory service, the difficulties in Quebec,although serious, have been exaggerated and I believe they have been overcome. we found it necessary to exercise a good deal of patience and firmness. We were obligedat one time to withdraw the operation of the Habeas Corpus Act, and, in addition tothat, we made the provision that anyone engaged in forcible resistance to compulsory service, or in encouraging forcible resistance, should ipso facto become a member ofthe Canadian Expeditionary Force, notwithstanding age or physical condition oranything else. I think that probably it had a good effect. It seemed to be basedboth on practical and logical considerations. Certainly it was practical, and it was alsological because any person displaying so excellent a fighting spirit should have anopportunity of exercising it against the enemies of the Empire.MR. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN : I hope Sir Robert Borden, if he has occasion to speak to our own people, will tell them what he has just told us.SIR ROBERT BORDEN : We have also prohibited the manufacture, importationand inter-provincial transportation of intoxicating liquors. The sale of intoxicatingliquors is under the jurisdiction of the provinces, all of which have enacted prohibitionexcept Quebec, and it is prohibited there as from the first day of May .1919.MR. BONAR LAW : Is it really unobtainable ?SIR ROBERT BORDEN : I have never made any practical experiments. I under-stand it is very difficult to get. It was not unobtainable by any means until we passed this Order, because one province would supply another, and various devices existed forevading the law as between the different provinces, but these devices have been defeatedby the Order in Council, which has been so framed as to prevent evasion. ,.We have also established a Food Controller, and latterly the Canada Food Board&apos;.The Canada Food Board keeps in close touch with the Food Controller of the UnitedStates.   There are frequent conferences, and the co-operation between the two countries   *is all that can be desired.It has been found necessary to establish a Fuel Controller. We are dependenton the United States for 16 million tons of coal per annum, and they also depend upon us for a certain amount. The geographical situation and the location of the coal areasaccount for this. For the purpose of fuel supply the United States have treatedCanada precisely as if Canada were part of the United States.In regard to steel plates the United States have been good enough to supply us with these at precisely the same rate as themselves. But, in addition, we have made arrangements with the Dominion Steel Company in Canada to supply 50,000 tons ofsteel plates a year for five years at an agreed price. New yards have been established,and they are kept at work in order to increase the output of shipbuilding to thegreatest possible extent.We have undertaken a National Registration. All men and women in Canadaover 16 years of age will be registered on the 29th June,    Various particulars
with regard to their occupation, their usefulness, their capabilities, and so forth willbe taken at that time, so that after that date we hope to have data which willbe of great service in connection with the enforcement of the Military service act, and which will also be of vast importance in mobilising our effort for war purposes.We have established a War Trade Board, which works in close co-operation withthe War Trade Board of the United States. There is great commercial intercoursebetween the two countries. Each country requires raw materials of the other.Restrictions have to be placed upon the use of these raw materials. The War trade board deals with the importation and distribution of articles required for the war, andalso restricts exportation where necessary.We have also established a Canadian War Mission at Washington, which has beenvery useful in keeping in touch for war purposes with the various departments of theUnited States Government. In that connection, we have sent to the United states for recruiting purposes and to assist in organising the forces of that country 229Canadian officers.The increased production of food has been taken up actively by the Departmentof Agriculture in co-operation with the provincial Governments, and a very muchgreater area of land has been cultivated. The crop to be obtained depends upon theclimatic conditions of the season.   The prospects seem very good indeed at the moment.We have continued actively the production of munitions. The total amount oforders placed in Canada has been 1,148 million dollars ; the disbursements amount to943 million dollars, of which 372 million dollars were provided in the first instance by the Imperial Treasury; 460 million dollars were provided by the dominion government and 100 million dollars by the Canadian banks. There are 950 manu-facturers who have received contracts, and 400 of these are now engaged. Sevennational plants have been established by the Imperial Munitions Board. We have started also the manufacture of high-grade aeroplane engines, some of which are nowbeing produced, and it is expected that from 1,000 to 1,500 will be delivered in 1918.Through the agency of the Canadian War Mission at Washington&apos;we have undertaken for the United States Government the production of shells, cartridges, aeroplanes, &amp;c,and in this way 100 million dollars worth of orders have already been secured. Itis anticipated that probably another 100 million dollars worth will be secured duringthe course of the year. We have also undertaken recently the production of seaplanesand kite balloons, owing to certain apprehensions of the Admiralty communicated tous by Admiral Sir William Grant, Commanding the North American Station.With regard to labour we have had a number of strikes, very few of which havebeen prolonged. I believe there has been less loss through strikes in Canada than inany portion of the Empire, unless it may be South Africa. In the Government whichwas formed last December a very able representative of organised labour, SenatorRobertson, was included, and his services have been of inestimable value to the peopleof Canada during the last eight months. He has the quality of conciliating men ina very marked degree. He is a broad-minded, able, level-headed man, and one of themost useful and capable men in the Government.We have also established a Pensions Board and an Invalided Soldiers&apos; Commission,but I need not dwell upon these unless desired.We have found it necessary, on account of our relations with the United States,to establish a Controller of Electrical Power, who works with the correspondingdepartment of the United States Government, and all difficulties on this question are,I think, in process of adjustment.Also we have very considerably increased our taxation. I think the War profits tax is the most severe that has been established in any country so far. Certainly,those engaged in business are of that opinion. So far as incomes are concerned we did not feel it desirable to go much beyond the taxation of incomes in the United States.Canada will require in future large amounts of capital for its development, and unduetaxation of capital brought into the country would be detrimental.With regard to the raising of moneys for the war we have had difficult conditions,but they have been met. Last autumn the Minister of Finance undertook a domesticloan. The amount fixed was 150 million dollars. The total realised was 400 million dollars, and estimating the relative wealth of Canada to that of the United States as1 to 30, or, as some say, 1 to 50, it would represent a loan of from 12 to 20 billiondollars in the United States. It will be seen that the Canadian effort was wonderfuland far greater than could have been anticipated.
We have enacted what is popularly known as the Anti-Loafing Act, which requires that every man in the country, regardless of income or position, between the ages of16 and 60, shall be engaged in some useful occupation: We except strikes, which arise out of actual difficulties between employers and employees, but not sympatheticstrikes. This law has been very useful. It is couched in general terms so that it ispossible to interpret the law as local conditions might require. It has been exceedinglyeffective in the western provinces, where, I believe, some people of alien birth were inclined to insist upon wages at from 6 to 8 dollars a day for doing agricultural work,and not working-at all unless they got it.With respect to the effort of the United States in this war, we are closely associated with them and perhaps realise their conditions better than they might be understood here. As you all know, the quality of the men sent over by the UnitedStates is wonderfully good, and will so continue. If that country has sufficient timeto organise, and if it proceeds with the organisation of its military forces uponefficient lines I have not the slightest doubt that at the end of this war it willpossess the most formidable military force of any of the belligerent nations. Thepeople of the United States are working in deadly earnest in this war ; that may notbe true oi absolutely the whole of the country, but certainly it is true of much thelarger portion of it. One of the greatest problems of the moment is how to bring theAmerican forces into active military service with the least possible delay. I shall make a suggestion later with regard to that.We are anxious in Canada to know authoritatively what you regard as yourgreatest need. Outside finance and outside the necessary mobilisation of all the energy of the country for war purposes there seem to be four main requirements men,food, munitions, and ships. Sometimes we are more or less at a loss to know what isthe greatest need. Realising at the moment that men were the greatest need, werecently took power under a Resolution of our Parliament 10 abolish all exemptionsof every kind in respect of any class or portion of a class called out. That law hasbeen acted upon by absolutely abolishing exemptions in respect of men from 20 to 22years of age. From that class has come the largest portion of the recruits who joined the colours in May. Our action has naturally produced a great deal of outcry,particularly among the agricultural classes, and we do not know how far we may haveto go. Upon that point I will not dwell further ; but we should like to be in conference with the relative Departments of the. Government here in order to reach a conclusion.With regard to naval and shipping matters, I had a talk with Sir William Grantbefore I left, and I hope to confer with Sir Joseph Maclay later. I think the dispositionswhich are being made in regard to submarine attack on our side of the Atlantic areas far advanced as could be expected under the circumstances. We have in service alarge number of patrol boats, mine-sweepers, &amp;c, and we have arranged for the produc-tion of seaplanes and kite balloons, which have been recommended by Sir WilliamGrant as additional precautions.(The Chief of tlie Imperial General Staff entered at this point.)Now I come to some matters which were raised the day before yesterday by thePrime Minister, and, in order to discharge my duty both to you and to my own people,I will be perfectly frank. It would be idle for me to sit here unless I was perfectlyfrank. I hope any observations that I make, if they are not regarded as agreeable,will be understood as having been made under a thorough sense of duty and with themost earnest desire to help, and with no other purpose whatever.I have no special or technical knowledge of military matters. But no one could fail to be disagreeably impressed by the statement that Germany with an equal force hasbeen able to drive us back in her recent offensive and to inflict upon us greater lossesthan have been sustained by her own forces. The net result of that is that Germanynow has a superiority of numbers. What is to prevent Germany with a superiority in numbers from repeating even more successfully what she did with an equality of numbers during the past three or four months ? I may say that the success of theGerman effort during the last three months or&apos; thereabouts since 21st March has produced a most depressing effect upon us in Canada. I am not desirous of dwellingon matters of the past, upon which it is useless to lay undue emphasis ; what I say is put forward with the desire that we may in the future avoid the terrible disasters andthe unfortunate mistakes of the past. There must be a cause for our failure, anddoubtless that failure depends upon more than one cause.
It is unnecessary to say that the men of these Islands are as brave, as intelligent,,and as good fighting material as can be found anywhere in the world. We have sent from Canada more than 375,000 men to the front since the commencement of this war.Of that force 175,000 men were born in the British Isles. When I speak of the goodwork in preparation and organisation that has been accomplished by the Canadians atthe front, I am speaking of a force which has been derived to the extent of two-fifthsfrom men born in these Islands. It seems apparent, having regard to the material ofwhich the British Army is composed, that the unfortunate results which have obtainedduring the past year, and especially during the past three months, are due to lack offoresight, lack of preparation, and to defects of system and organisation. Since our last meeting I sent for General Currie, the Commander of the Canadian Army Corps,and I ordered him to tell me the truth so far as he understood it with respect to theoccurrences of the past few months. Before this war we had no actual militaryexperience. On the 1st August, 1914, he was an insurance and real estate agent inVancouver, although he had been connected with the Canadian Militia, and had studiedmilitary tactics and military affairs more or less throughout his life. Last year I heardexcellent reports of the efficiency of the Canadian Army Corps. Since my arrival thisyear the information which has reached me, indicates beyond question that GeneralCurrie has wonderfully developed and improved its efficiency. I asked him to describeto me the incidents of the past year, the incidents of the past three months, and to tellme his own experience. I shall not go through it all, but I will give you a few incidentsby way of illustration. The Canadian Army Corps were ordered to take Passchendaele.Previous attempts had been made, and I understand that they had all been unsuccessful.General Currie looked over the situation and reported that he could take Passchendaelewith a loss of 15,000 men. Eventually he took it with a loss of 16,000 men. Hereports to me that the gain was not worth the candle, that the result was not worth theloss, that immediately alterwards the British Army went on the defensive, and the taking of Passchendaele at so great a loss had really no result of importance. Accordingto his report the situation, when he was called upon to attack Passchendaele, was amost indescribable confusion in all the arrangements. He gave me illustrations, ofwhich I shall quote one. Whenever the Canadian Corps was called on to attack,General Currie always had his attacking troops in the trenches at least thirty-six hoursbefore the hour fixed for attack, in order that both officers and men might becomeacquainted with the nature of the ground, might learn precisely where the objectivelay, and the nature of the intervening terrain. On one of his flanks a British battalioncame into the trenches the night before the attack, and had no opportunity whatever of becoming acquainted with the ground. Four companies wandered over to the Canadiansin the morning, and asked if the Canadians knew where they should go. the canadians gave them the best information in their possession. Two of these british companies stationed themselves at a point which proved to be about 100 yards ahead of the barrage. When the barrage lifted those two companies became non-existent.The two supporting companies in their confusion and lack of knowledge came over and attacked the Canadians. General Currie was informed that he would be supported by364 guns but he found only 220. In more than one instance a battery which shouldhave had six guns had only one or two. Each gun is supposed to cover 15 yards ;&apos;abattery with one gun instead of six must therefore cover 90 yards, and the barrage isconsequently ineffective. When General Currie asked for more guns he was asked tosend indents. He said he could not fight the Germans with indents ; he wanted guns,he could not get them. Incidents like this occurred all the time, not only atPasschendaele but elsewhere. There-was lack of preparation and of foresight. Therewas also lack of proper intelligence. Three days before the offensive of the 21st Marcha tip was given by the British Intelligence Service to the Canadian Army Corps thatthere would be no offensive at all. General Currie told me that, when documentscame to him signed by the Chief Intelligence Officer, he made a practice of looking at the signature, and, if it was that of the Chief Intelligence Officer, he always tore upthe document and threw it in the waste basket without reading it, as he was confident that it was more likely to mislead than to inform.As to preparation to meet the German offensive, General Currie told me that, ata conference with three other Corps Commanders, enquiry was made as to thepreparation of barbed wire entanglements. The Commander of the Portuguese saidthat his corps had not been using any barbed wire as their defences were completewithout any such precaution. One British Commander said that his corps, had putout 30,000 yards of barbed wire, another reported that he had put out 33,000 yards,while the Canadians had put out 375,000 yards. General Currie described to me the[543-2] C
character of the barbed-wire defences which were prepared by his corps, and theco-ordination of his machine gun defences. I do not believe the Germans could possibly have got through our line had it been prepared throughout in the same manner as the defences of the Canadian Army Corps. At all events the Germans wouldhave been stopped at a very early stage. He described to me the elaborate nature ofhis barbed-wire defences. Before the front there were seven zigzags of barbed wire,very skilfully arranged, and co-ordinated with machine gun defences. Before eachtrench, back almost to the horse lines, there were similar defences with machine gunemplacements carefully concealed and very strongly protected. When he had toextend his line he increased his machine guns by 50 per cent., and trained thenecessary crews therefor within a few days. As to the arrangements in the BritishCorps with regard to machine guns, I am convinced that they might be greatly improved ; they are very different from those which prevail in the CanadianArmy CorpsTHE PRIME MINISTER : In what respect ?SIR ROBERT BORDEN : I think in the British Army they are so arranged as tobe dispersed instead of concentrated. In the Canadian army corps we have them incompanies so that their fire can be concentrated. In regard to the British Army, I was told that they simply dispersed them amongst the battalions without co-ordination, andwithout effective arrangements for concentrating their fire. I know from a Field-Marshalin the British Army that, many years before this war began, he made a strong-recommendation that the machine gun arrangements in the British Army should beplaced at least on a level with that of the Germans. I do not think anything was donefrom the time that report was made up to the time the present war broke out.I asked General Currie why the British Corps Commanders did not establishbarbed-wire defences on the same scale as his own. He said that many of the commanders stated that they had held the Germans in 1914 without barbed wire andthat they could hold them in the same way in 1918. Apparently these officers wereutterly oblivious of the remarkable changes in methods of warfare which have takenplace in the meantime. Last year I was told in France that the methods of the yearprevioiis were in some respects obsolete, and that new methods were being continuallydevised.General Currie described to a British officer on one occasion the character of theCanadian barbed-wire defences. That officer told him that in his corps they had nothing comparable and that in his particular battalion the men were engaged in preparing lawn tennis courts last autumn while the Canadians were erectingbarbed-wire entanglements.I am informed that there has been conspicuous failure to remove incompetentofficers. No one questions the splendid gallantry of officers, as well as men, in theBritish Army. Officers who make mistakes are always ready to atone by their deathin fighting to the last, but mistakes, even though atoned for by death, will end inlosing this war. I have reason to believe that some of these brave officers areexceedingly casual, although they are brave beyond description. This war cannot bewon by casual allusion to or reliance \xpon what was done in 1914, and by neglect of preparation, which would have stopped the Germans.I do not wish to be understood as suggesting that General Currie criticised all the divisions of the British army. He told me that there were many many magnificentdivisions properly trained and thoroughly organised, but that there were enough not properly trained, organised or led by competent officers to give the Germansopportunity of breaking through.THE PRIME MINISTER: Do you mean by &quot; officers &quot; general officers orregimental officers ?SIR ROBERT BORDEN : I think he means officers all the way through.THE PRIME MINISTER : Including Brigadier-Generals and Corps Commanders ?SIR ROBERT BORDEN : He told me the younger members of the Staff last november or December recommended that ten Corps Commanders ought to be dispensed with and other men put in their places; but that none were removeduntil about the time this offensive began ; perhaps shortly before ; the others havenot been removed.
MR. MASSEY : This is very important statement about the Corps Commanders,because I understand an Army Corps consists of three divisions, consequently theseare men in very high command.THE PRIME MINISTER : Who suggested these changes ?SIR ROBERT BORDEN : The younger members of the Staff at the front. Isit or is it not the case that men of great ability who have gone into the army duringthis war have been systematically held down to positions no higher than Brigadier-Generals ? If that is the case, I say with all respect, that it amounts to scrappingthe brains of the nation in the greatest struggle of history. At the outbreak ofthis war Canada had a small permanent army. What would have happened if wehad laid down the principle, and acted upon it, that no man should fill a higherposition than that of Brigadier-General xrnless he had been a member of our standingarmy? What would be the position of our Canadian Army Corps to-day if that principle had been carried out ? Certainly the remarkable ability of our Command-ing Officer would never have been discovered or utilised and the Canadian Army Corpswould not have been in its present condition of efficiency. Doubtless the career of menwho have undertaken military life as a profession must be considered ; but after allthe issue before us makes the career of any man&apos; of little consequence. Of whatimportance is the career of any man around this table, of what1 consequence is thecareer of all of us together compared with the present issue ? Less than dust in thebalance. If we fail to use the brains of the nation for the best purpose available wecannot have much prospect of winning this war.With respect to lack of organisation let me give an illustration. General JackStewart is a Scotchman. He came to Canada about twenty-five or thirty years ago.He is as good a railroad builder as any man on the North American continent, and hehas had extended experience both in the United States aud Canada. I understandthat he is under the direction of officers who know nothing about railway construction, to which he has devoted his entire life. I understand hecould carry on his present work if given complete charge of it, with 40 per cent,of the men presently employed ; the rest can go into the line I believe there hasbeen a report that he is not considered sufficiently self-assertive. Self-assertive ornot, I know he can accomplish results. He was asked as a most urgent matter tobuild a railway for the construction of which the French Engineers estimated six weeks and the British Engineers three weeks. He examined the ground and reported that hecould build it in six days. He actually built it in four days. A man who can accom-plish such results need not be put in the background because he is not consideredself-assertive. The future of this war in more senses than one depends upon our earnest-ness. We came over to fight in earnest; and Canada will fight it out to the end. Butearnestness must be expressed in organisation, foresight, preparation. Let the pastbury its dead, but for God&apos;s sake let us get down to earnest endeavour and hold this line until the Americans can come in and help us to sustain it till the end.So far as the Americans are concerned, let me give you another illustration.General Currie was asked a little more than two weeks ago whether he could sendinstructors to train machine gunners for the United States troops. He was engaged intraining more machine gunners for the Canadian Army Corps, and he said he couldspare no men. The officer who came to him took &quot; No &quot; for an answer. The same afternoon General Currie, after giving further consideration, concluded that the same purpose could be answered in another way. Accordingly he reported to the officerthat if twenty companies of Americans were sent he would train them with his ownmen, as he could do that without interfering with his own training arrangements.From that day to the present he has not heard a word on this subject.I venture to suggest that the Canadian Army Corps might be used with great advantage for training American troops. We live next door to these people; weunderstand them and they understand us.THE PRIME MINISTER : The problem which they have to solve is yours ?SIR ROBERT BORDEN : That is so. I should be glad to discuss this question with the Prime Minister ; and I am confident that good results could be accomplishedupon that line. &apos; The Americans are very earnest; they have the same earnestnesswhich animates our own people. I believe they would welcome the opportunity to unite with us in the formation of an army. At all events the proposal is worth considering. The Americans would get on with us probably better than with any ofthe Allies ; and I believe that their training would be expedited becaxise, as I have said,
we understand them and they understand us, and there is the best possible feeling between the people of the two countries. It is singular in one way and not in anotherthat the American people are proud of what Canada has done in this war. If theorganisation can be expedited in the way I have suggested, it is desirable to attempt it.The whole issue of this war depends on the speed with which the American troops canbe organised, trained, and put into the fighting line. When that is once done therecannot be much doubt as to what the result will be. If this war continues for a year or eighteen months, the United States will have a more formidable military force in thefield than any of the belligerent nations. Meantime it is a question whether we shallbe ignominiously defeated and driven out of France, or whether we can hold on.I have spoken with a great deal of frankness, but I hope that what I have saidwill be received in the spirit in which I put it forward, and I can assure you that it isintended only to be helpful and not to discourage.THE PRIME MINISTER: We shall consider very carefully the statement which sir Robert Borden has just made.MR. MASSEY : I think Sir Robert Borden was justified in expressing the opinionthat he has expressed and in making the statement that he has made to the imperial war Cabinet. The representatives of the Overseas Dominions of the Empire are nothere for the purpose of fault finding, neither are they here for the purpose of adversecriticism. They are here to speak plainly and to be perfectly candid. I would like tosay here how much I appreciated the statement which the Prime Minister made to usa day or two ago. It was made in the proper spirit. He wras perfectly candid with us, and we intend to be candid with you. We cannot understand I am speaking fromthe New Zealand point of view   what has happened during the last few months. Wewere given to understand that our armies, the Allied Armies, were superior in numbers and moral to the German forces, and yet we see what has happened since the 21stMarch last, for the first time in many years, and this is what we have to face, and we might just as well face it at once the Empire is in danger. I believe that we shallget out of it, as the nation has got out of similar dangers in days gone by. Still, theoutlook at the present moment is far from bright, and it is up to us, if we can, to finda remedy for the evils which exist, and there must be a remedy. There is somethingwrong somewhere, and we have got to find it. For instance, I do not know that thePrime Minister is possessed of the necessary information to tell us, but I hopewe shall be able to get it from the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, thehistory of what happened to the Fifth Army, I have made many enquiries, but have never found an oBicer who lias been able to tell me. So far as my own country is concerned, it is only right that I should say this, there has been agreat deal of uneasiness felt ever since the Passchendaele fight. I have not seen the New Zealand Generals, but I hope to have an opportunity of seeing them before long. Sir Joseph Ward and I will visit the front later, or possibly the generalswill come to London. Reliable officers and men have made statements to me whichhave been unasked for so far as I was concerned that were horrifying with regard towhat took place at Passchendaele. I was told last night by a most reliable man aman I knew years ago, before he joined the army at all that the New Zealanders (hewas one of them) were asked to do the impossible, what was found to be impossibleafter the fight. He said the New Zealanders were sent to Passchendaele, to a swampylocality where it was almost impossible to walk, and where they found themselves up against particularly strong barbed-wire entanglements, which it was impossible forthem to cut. They were, he said, simply shot down like rabbits. Now, somebody is responsible for that, and whoever is responsible for it ought to take the consequences,whatever they may be. These are the sort of things that are going to lead to serious trouble. I do not shut my ears to the opinions of uneasiness that have been expressed in England ; but if this thing goes on, if it is not remedied in the nearfuture I am not pessimistic, but I feel we shall have such trouble as very fewBritish citizens contemplate. Therefore, I do hope that we shall be able to get an explanation of what took place at Passchendaeie and other places. I hope that weshall be told what happened to the Vth Army. I have not sought information frompeople who ought not to give it to me, but though I have asked many persons I amstill in the dark, and I presume most of the members of the War Cabinet are in thesame position at the moment.
Now, so far as New Zealand is concerned, 1 do not need to tell members of theWar Cabinet that we are only a small community of 1,150,000. The number of troops,,all branches, which have sailed from New Zealand, including camp strengths and troops in training, as at the present date, amount to 108,140. This, of course, does hotinclude the whole of the enlistments, because members will understand that a great many men have enlisted, either under the Compulsory Service Act or voluntarily, whowere afterwards turned down as being physically unfit, so that in all probabilityanother 10,000 enlisted who are not included in the number I have mentioned.Then we know that a very large number of young New Zealanders are said to haveenlisted in the Imperial Army: I do not find any fault with them. Probably they thought that the openings would be better and the prospects would be better in alarger army, and thus they were prepared to go to England, and we placed nodifficulties in their way. At that time men in New Zealand were turning up more rapidly than we could train them. Quite a number of men went over to Australia andenlisted there. I think we made a mistake in allowing them to go. I am puttingdown the total who went at 2,000, who left us in that way. I know that is under the mark. That brings up the total of New Zealanders who have left their country or areleaving there for the purpose of assisting in the war to 110,140. In addition to that wehave equipped two hospital ships. I do not say that they are ours, but we havechartered them for the period of the war and have supplied all the necessary equipment.These are doing good work. We have spent about 500,000Z. on these hospital&apos; ships.We have sent 500 trained nurses to the front ; most of them are there to-day. We have sent 12,000 horses to Egypt. The casualties up to the 30th April, 1018 that is, six orseven weeks ago-were 44,933. The casualties at Gallipoli were 8,277, and the numberof men returned to New Zealand, mostly incapacitated from wounds or from sickness and some of them, of course, who were found not to be able to stand the hard workentailed by the fighting, number 19,302. Just one *ord with regard to the details ofthe casualties. Killed in action, 7,963 ; died of wounds, 3,069 ; died of disease, 818 ;died from causes unknown, 769 ; drowned, 50 ; missing, 104 ; prisoners of war. 130 ;wounded, 32,130. It is needless for me to remind Ministers that, in all probability,a very large number of these men will, in the ordinary way, return to the front. Sofar as the financial side is concerned, the total amount we have raised for war purposesis 46,304,8001. Of that 1 think perhaps the Finance Minister wall correct me if I amwrong 36,000,OOOL were raised locally in New Zealand ; the balance was raised inEngland at the commencement of the war. The compulsory provision was not inoperation, and it was not found necessary to bring in any of the capitalists who generallyfind money for these purposes, but the compulsory provision, being on the Statute Book,had its effect. On our loan we are paying 4f per cent, interest, which, of course, isfree of income tax. That rate is low, I think, compared with the rate paid in England.Our total war expenditure to the. 8th April of this year is 41,775,3361. It is worthmentioning that, at the commencement of the war, a number of citizens desirous of con-tributing towards the financing of the war sent to the New Zealand Government172,476L, to be used for any purpose it liked.&apos; We used that money in the purchaseof horses and equipment for the forces for Egypt. Then, in regard to voluntary contributions, in money and goods, to the 31st December, 1917, the citizens of NewZealand contributed voluntarily, for such purposes as the Red Cross, the &quot;t-M-CA.,and the Belgian Fund, 4,543,244L Since then, though I am not able to give the exactfigures, a very great deal of canvassing has been going on for funds, and with great success, I am bound to say, and I think I am justified in saying that, from, the 1stJanuary of this year up to, say, the end of May, not less than another 500,000L havebeen contributed for patriotic purposes.In regard to pensions to returned soldiers, 17,117 pensions have been granted.The total amount which we have paid out up to the present for the purpose of pensionsamounts to 1,122,052L, and our net annual liability up to the present, so far as pensions are concerned, is 930,000Z. Needless to say, this is rapidly increasing, and will go on increasing as long as the war lasts. Without going into details, I may say that ourpensions are&quot; given on a liberal scale, and also provisions are made for giving financialassistance to the dependents of soldiers. In regard to soldiers who have come alongeither voluntarily, or who have been called up compulsorily, and who have been earning,say, from &apos;300l. to 1,000L a year, it was found impossible to keep their dependentsin the same state of comfort which obtained prior to the soldier&apos;s enlisting. For thepurpose of attending to such cases we have set up a Financial Assistance Board, so thatdependents can come to this Board and obtain assistance, in addition to the ordinaryprovision by way of allowances and that sort of thing. Dependents can obtain[543-2] D
assistance for such purposes as the payment of insurance premiums, or the paymentof taxes, or the payment of rent, and things of that kind.With regard to prisoners of war, we have not many.   There are only 395, and weare taking good care of them.Those are the principal details. I want now to refer to some points similar tothose mentioned by Sir Robert Borden. So far as compulsory service is concerned, weintroduced and passed into law our Compulsory Military Service Act in the session of1916, and were looking forward to meeting the position. At that time men were coming forward fairly satisfactorily, but they were not coming forward at the same rate as at the outbreak of war. We found too that there were quite a number of menwho were shirking what seemed to us to be their duty. They were quite willing thatothers should go to the front and do the fighting and put up with the hardships that soldiers have to put up with. We thought it was unfair, and we brought in the compulsory Service Act, on the lines of Lincolns legislation, which he brought into,operation at the time of the Civil War in the United States. I am bound to say this that it has worked very well indeed. Of course, there was a proportion of the popula-tion who were opposed to anything in the way of compulsory service ; but I think theAct was necessary.Sir Robert Borden also alluded to the supply of food. We have not got a FoodController in New Zealand, but we have a Government organisation that looks after theprices of food. There are lots of complaints and lots of adverse criticism with regard toit, but we are in this position to-day namely, that the increase in the cost of living, as itis called, to use the common term, is less in New Zealand than in any other part of theBritish Empire. According to figures, the increased cost in New Zealand has been27 per cent. ; it is very much higher in Australia, and even in the United States and canada. I think I am right in saying that in England it is something like 100 percent., as compared with 27 per cent, in New Zealand. The cases are not necessarilyparallel, but they are interesting to notice.Our principal difficulty I am glad to see the Shipping Controller present hasbeen at times to find sufficient shipping to take away our produce and to bring it to this side of the world. I want to take this opportunity of saying that the ShippingController has treated New Zealand generously; I have not the slightest fault tofind with his administration. We have lost some ships, but we know the reason.Few ships are going to New Zealand at present, but we have to put up with it, because we know perfectly well that they are required for other more urgent purposes ; but weare looking forward to the return of those ships. I hope the Shipping Controller willlet us have enough to go on with. Up to this morning I think we had nearly 5,000,000carcasses of meat in the stores in New Zealand, in addition to dairy produce, whichwere awaiting the ships to come along. It is exceedingly important to us that weshould get the ships ; it is very important from the point of view of the war, because,if we do not export our produce to the world, from the financial and commercial pointof view we might as well put up the shutters, because the Finance Minister will not beable to collect the taxation he requires for war purposes.There are one or two other items which are worth mentioning. I would like to tell the Imperial War Cabinet what New Zealand is doing for her returned soldiers. we know perfectly well that, in order to meet the enormous liabilities that we are pilingup, and which are likely to be further increased very greatly increased, I am afraid before this war comes to an end, we shall have to increase our output. We have not come to that yet, hxit that time will probably arrive, and we are endeavouring tomake arrangements for increasing our output by giving to our own soldiers, in thefirst place, and later on to soldiers from the Imperial Army, an opportunity, if they feel inclined to take it, to make homes for themselves and to become industrioussettlers and help their own country and the Empire in that way. Up to the time ofour leaving New Zealand, some 700 of our returned soldiers have been placed on theland, and are actually in possession of their holdings, which have been selected byBoards not appointed for that particular purpose, but which have made it part oftheir business. These Boards select the soldiers, and the soldiers are given sectionsof land which are suitable to the variety of farming they desire to take up. They areassisted financially ; an advance up to 500L is made to each soldier selected, but if heis a good man and wants more the Department has authority to lend him up to 750LThe numbers of soldiers who have taken up sheep farming and who have turned outwool during the last year, and also those who have taken up dairy farming with success,have surprised me. Hard work and strict attention to business is absolutely necessaryto the successful farmer.   I believe that 90 per cent, of the soldiers that have been put
upon the land are going to become successful farmers. When the main body comeback, of course, we shall have to make provision for them, and we are looking forward to making provision for at least 5,000 of our own soldiers. We have a considerableamount of improved land awaiting settlers, which will be suitable for many men who arenot able to live in bush country. For those soldiers who will return physically fit thereis plenty of new land in the bush, but for the other men, who are partially incapacitated,we are making facilities for supplying them with land in agricultural districts at as reasonable a price as it is possible to supply it, certainly at a price which later onwill enable them to make a comfortable living. Some have been assisted by the pensionsthey have received. In this direction the outlook from our point of view is encouraging.There will be a lot of men who will come back who will be unable to return to the trades and professions at which they were formerly employed ; they have got to change to other trades. Men who were formerly carpenters, for instance, are very often not able to go back to their former occupation. What we are doing is this : we are making certainarrangements with the Trades Unions and with employers and with the authorities of technical schools. In the case of the technical schools, if a man is desirous of learninganything useful which a technical school can teach him, we allow him 1Z. a week, inaddition to his pension, during the time he is at the school. On the other hand, if hegoes to learn a trade at some of the industrial establishments in New Zealand, wearrange with the Trade Unions, the labour organisations, and with the employers togive him the minimum pay, not the pay generally given to an apprentice, but theminimum pay of a journeyman. Many men have taken advantage of this. It is too soon to say whether what we are doing in this direction will be successful, but fromappearances it is likely to be good. It will, of course, cost money, but we are justifiedin spending money in this way, and it is not wasted from the point of view of the State.The production of food during the war comes next in importance to the supply ofmen. Men first and food next, that is what I have impressed upon our people. Someof them have said to me, &quot; We shall be just as usefully employed producing wool, ormutton, or lamb, or whatever it may be,&quot; but I have always taken up the otherposition, that we have to find the men first, and that it was the duty of those left behind to go on producing the food. In spite of the scarcity of ships, we exported from New Zealand last year in the way of foodstuffs and other products, such aswool, 31,500,000t. worth, and if we had had ships sufficient we could have exportedanother 5,000,O00L or 8,000,000 . worth. I am not complaining in the least; I havealready expressed myself on that point. Considering that 110,000 men at least havebeen withdrawn from their ordinary occupations, I think those who are left behindhave risen to the occasion and exercised a great deal of energy and industry, or elsethat 31,500,0001. would not have been forthcoming.I am glad to say that we have no strikes in New Zealand ; we are not entirely free from strikes there, but we have none just now. In New Zealand we have no industrialtrouble at the present moment from one end of the country to the other. Of course,we cannot expect that state of things to continue indefinitely. We know some time orother that we shall have labour troubles, but the patriotic appeal which we have alwaysmade has been very successful. I myself control the Department which deals with industrial trouble, and I have found in the past that an appeal to the workmen and employers on patriotic grounds, and for the sake of the Empire, has always had a good effect.Then we have established a Soldiers&apos; Employment Department. Every soldierwho comes back to New Zealand is looked after by this Department, which makes itits business to get a list of those carried by every ship with returned men on board.Every man is interviewed and asked whether he requires employment; whether he hasa business to go back to ; and whether he wishes to return to his former employment.This record is kept, and if a man desires new employment it is the duty of the Soldiers&apos;Employment Department to find it for him. Up to the present the Soldiers&apos; employment department of New Zealand is able to account for over 19,000 men. Every man whohas been willing to work has had the opportunity of getting it. So far as theGovernment is concerned returned soldiers get preference in regard to employment on government work, whatever that employment may be. It is rather too soon to look forward to, but we have .sufficient work for 15,000 men as soon as demobilisationcommences.We do not anticipate any difficulty in finding revenue. We have had greatly toincrease our taxes, and although we may suffer from it, we know perfectly well thatthe money has to be found ; we know perfectly well that if we win the war we shallhave something left; but if Germany wins the war we shall have nothing left.   I do[543-2] E
not think the Finance Minister expects more than the usual difficulty in finding money,which will depend to a great extent upon Sir Joseph Maclay being able to-give; ussufficient shipping.I was very interested in what Sir Robert Borden said about the Anti-LoafingLegislation. We have a similar legislation in New Zealand. We have got a law whichis part of the war legislation, which requires that every man in New Zealand, if he isphysically fit, it does not matter what his position may be, must show that he isoccupied in some useful occupation. We leave it to himself to say what his occupationis to be. It has not been found necessary strictly to enforce the Act, but there it is,and it has had a good effect.Before we left we found it necessary to pass legislation providing for the controlof industries. By this means we are able to take men from non-essential industries and find employment for them in industries which are really essential, such as theproduction of food.Sir Robert Borden has told you briefly what has taken place in the United States.My colleague and myself, as well as the Australian members of the party, had theopportunity of seeing what was happening in the United States. We only passed through the country, and only stayed one day in New York, but on the ship on whichwe sailed there were 2,300 American soldiers, and as we were nearly a fortnightcoming over, we had an opportunity of finding out a great deal of what has taken placein America, and I want to endorse what has been said by Sir Robert Borden. What--ever may have been the case up to the last few months, or the last few weeks, at thepresent moment the Americans are going into the war with a keenness and an energywhich will surprise many, which I am delighted to see, and which I am glad to acknowledge now. They mean business, and as they have the population and the wealth, I have no doubt that what has taken place in America will have a very goodresult on the whole course of the war. I never saw better men, and better conductedmen, than the 2,300 with whom we travelled. If all the soldiers sent from America areanything like the men whose acquaintance we made, 1 think the Kaiser will have to reconsider what he has said, namely, that what America was doing was only bluff.I only hope they are not too late. I do not want to take a pessimistic view of theposition, but I hope they will be here in time to assist in saving the position.We are very proud of the record of New Zealand; at the same time it is only rightto admit that we have had less difficulties with which to contend than some of theother dominions of the Empire. Possibly we have had less to contend with thanAustralia. Probably we should have had greater difficulties had our population beenlarger. There is only a little disaffection here and there, which we find especially when a by-election comes along. The feeling in New Zealand is this, and it has existedalmost from the commencement of the war : We are going into this war to fight for ourselves. The impression during the Boer War was that we were sending troops tohelp England. That is not the feeling to-day. To-day we feel that we are fighting for ourselves just as much as we are fighting for the people in the United Kingdom, andthat the troops from the United Kingdom are fighting for us just as much as they are-fighting for the people of these Islands. On that account there has been much lessdifficulty than otherwise might have been the case.Not exactly at the beginning of the war, but after the war had been going on for ayear, we had to make arrangements with the war authorities in England in regard tothe supply of men. We arranged to send a certain number each month, and I am glad to say that up to the present we are not a single man behind. Later on the WarOffice told us that our monthly draft was too large, and it was not necessary to send so many, and they cut it down. I was very glad, therefore, when the appeal went to theDominions from the Prime Minister, after that big fight at the end of March, to be able to respond to the requirements satisfactorily to us and, I have reason to believe, satisfactorilyto the Imperial authorities. I do not know, of course, how long we shall be able to,keep up 2,000 a month. Our General in Command in England told me yesterday hewas afraid there would be difficulty after October of the present year. There are over,000 from New Zealand on the water at the present moment. We are now callingTip married men. We have some 10,000 married men who have joined up withoutbringing the Compulsory Service Act into operation at all. We have not yet called into-camp any married men with children. We are taking the married men without children first. Then we intend to take the married men with one child next. Then thereis the annual crop of young fellows as they become 19. We do not compel them to enlistat 19 ; but the Compulsory Service Act makes them come in at 20. This has worked well.   We hope that, after the end of the European summer, it will not be necessary ta
eend so many men overseas as we are doing from New Zealand at present. If so, weshall experience difficulty; but, whatever the difficulties may be, I want to Bay this, apartfrom any adverse criticism, and apart from any criticism such as we have had from sir robert Borden, and which I endorse, New Zealand is in the war right to the very end.We have been able to do what we have in New Zealand because of the very largeproportion of the people there who are possessed of the true British spirit, which comesout all the more clearly the greater the difficulties to be met. We are patrioticImperialists, and we have supported the Home Government in every possible way.Although we have had our difficulties, I am bound to say that we have had the whole-hearted support of the great bulk of the population, and I believe that will continueto be the case.   ^ ,I will conoids by saying that anything that New Zealand can do, either here orin our own country, is only to be asked for by the representatives of the ImperialGovernment, and we will do our best to meet their requests.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,June 13,1918.0
