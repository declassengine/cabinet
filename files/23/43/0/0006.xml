GEIJJEAL WIL30I: In the remarks 1 am going to make thismorning I want to try and keep off detail and look at the thing a little bit in.the large.    Therefore,xif I do not try to answer what Sir Robert Borden brought up the other day had better do so some other time.    I would rathef keepaway from that for the moment and look at the picture in a somewhat different light.    I will divide my remarks under three headings; firstly, I will run quickly over all the 10theatres; secondly, I will show what 1 think is the differ-ence in the strategy between the Allies and the enemy, and thirdly, I will try and look a, -little hit into the future.We are circulating a Paper giving a good deal of detailwhich I will not touch upon ads this morning, and there is another Paper, a copy of which the prime Minister has reeeiv-ed, which gives a great deal of detail about the Dominions,so also I will not touch upon that point.As regards the different theatres of war, there are 10.We have France, which you all know just as much as I do, or nearly, with its 170 divisions on our side and&quot;with 200 or205 on the side of the enemy., with a line gradually gettinglonger, and with consequent greater anxiety to us, no doubt.We have Italy, which is the scene now of this Austrianattack.   You have seen the telegrams; the enemy has got alodgment in three places over the Piave, and which are markedon that map in front of theIllrd and Ylllth Italian Armies.She only really dangerous place is the Montello; that is theplace opposite the Italian VIIIth Army, where the enemy has got on to the Montello height.    It is a very strong place;they ought not to have got there, and they ought to be driv-en off, and probably will he, I should think.   As regards the attack on the British, we lie to the left of the VIth Army -on that little red patch on the map.. As you have seen bythe telegrams, we have re-established our line, and taken

700 prisoners.    We have done very well, although the attack was heavy for the size of the defense.    There were 4 or 5Austrians divisions against 2 of ours.The next theatre is Salonica.    The British have got 41/3divisions at Salonica; the French have got 8; the Italiansij^i the Greeks 6; and the Serbians 6, a total, roughly, of25 divisions, opposed to about even numbers.    That has beenvery stationary for a long time, and there is no sign of anattack at present.    That red line on the map is the line weare holding at Salonica.    The difficulty is that if the enemydrove in there, it would tend to throw half or one-third ofour force into salonica, and the other half back into Greece.For that reason we have been asking the French commander-in-Ohief to so arrange his plans that if he is heavily attacked,and cannot hold both Salonica and Greece, he shall give upSalonica and cover Greece.    The reason of that agat$n is morea naval question.    If we get thrown into Salonica, and theenemy gets into Greece, he can get his submarines here, and,in the end, we shall lose salonica too.   We have had greatdifficulty, as a matter of fact, which the Prime minister has often tried to remedy.   We had at Salonica at one time a French General called General sarrail; we could not get anyplans out of him, ever,    hatterly we have had a General downthere called General Guillaumat, and we have not got anyplans out of him either.    We have only got some sketch of plans, but no real plans, and it is very tiresome.   Meanwhilewe have 4 /3 divisions down there, under the French Command,of course.The next theatre is Palestine. In Palestine we have british and 4-g-. Indian divisions, a total of 5-g- divisions,and 3 Indian Cavalry divisions. India has played up in amost admirable way, and is sending us battalions so that weoan put them into our divisions, gradually pulling out our

&quot;battalions, and bringing them to France.    Gradually, there-fore, the force in Palestine will become increasingly of an indian character, and our battalions will come back to France.I shall have something to say about that a little later.Mesopotamia is the next theatre.    We have in Mesopotamia1 British and 4^ Indian divisions, and 3 Indian Cavalry Brig-ades.    The Mesopotamian theatre, really, is changing; it used*0 ^e &quot;frki-3       Basra, Bagdad   it is gradually becoming Basra,Bagdad, Hamadan, the Caspian, stretching out to the right.She original idea, of course, was to go up this way.    We havenow got ourselves somewhat deflected and are going out that way.    Our forces are much stronger than the forces opposedto us - at present they are1 much stronger.    There is no dang-er of any sort there at present, but, of course, our line isgetting much longer, and as this road, especially this bit,is bad, the difficulties of transport are great.The next theatre - I shall touch on these again a littlelater from another point of view, lb-tit I am just running rough-ly through them now - is East Africa,   in East Africa wehave 13 battalions.   It seems a small show, but we have beenchasing these Germans and the latives of that country desper-ately hard and have not yet knocked them out.    General smutswill tell us a great deal more about it than I could.   We goon and gradually on, and gradually are ending it, but it justdoes not end.The next theatre, which is a new one, is Murmansk. In this theatre there are three important ports, namely, petchenga,Murmansk, and Archangel. Owing to the Ffcnns having apparentlyjoined somebody who is an enemy of ours, I suppose the Germansthese ports, and especially Petohenga, the western one, aregradually getting into danger. If the Boehe can get Petchehgaand establish a submarine base there, they would probably nextgo for Archangel.   We are trying to hold those places, andwe have despatched to those three ports a couple of thousand4.

of our own men.   There are others, including the Serbians, wehad hoped to get some C&amp;echo-slovaks, but they do not seemever to get there.    They have been collecting up in this eoun-try; some of them went this way, and we tried to get some ofthem this way.   A certain number of them got this viray, I for-get exactly how many, but about 8,000 or 10,000, and thisway we had hoped to get quite a considerable force, but none of them have got through, and it does not look now as if theywould get through ever.    Our idea in holding these places was because it is the last and only door into Eussia, except this,so that, if we give up these places, or if we are compelledto evacuate them, we shall lose all direct touch, so far as england is concerned, with Russia.I will just touch on this Persian theatre, which is nowopening, with all this Shiraz trouble we have had.    The Per-&apos;sian theatre may be an absolutely separate theatre of fighting,presently.   At the present moment there is no regular war go-ing on here.    It is very curious but, at the present moment,the War Office is responsible for this particular campaign,which has now, as I was just saying, stretched out to the caspian.   The War Office are trying to figure it out now. ThePrime Minister had a Meeting about it yesterday.    GeneralMarshall1s troops are really facing to the north-west, andwe were only discussing this morning whether we ought not to face this way, too, or whether this ought to be a thing forIndia.   At the present moment the War office problem is&apos; a problem of going      from Bagdad out to the Caspian, facingthat way.    We have got a campaign coming, I hope, but it hasnot yet arrived, in Siberia.   But I will come back to it pres-ently.That is nine, and then ne have one other theatre that isconstant always, but someone else can say something about that,the Sea.    The Admiralty, I expect, will deal with that.

fhoee are the 10 theatres, 9 land and one sea..Looking back for 4 years, it is curious to see the way inwhich the strengths of the Allies and the enemy sway backwardsand forwards.In this next room, when I used to he Director ofMilitary Operations before the War, I went into this War agreat many years before it came.   I used to he puzzling how we would tackle this problem, and the problem we had then was:France, Eussia, and England against Germany, Austria, andItaly.   We &quot;stood in those days like this: we estimated that,on mobilisation, France had 75 divisions --(assuming divisions to he approximately equal)   Russia 78; and England 6; thatmakes 161.    On the other side Germany had 121; Austria 61;and Italy 36; that was in the month of August.   When the warcame it came a little hit different, because Italy did not join either side, and in addition to $ranee, Russia, and Eng-land, we had Serbia,    so in August 1914 we stood like that -about 160 divisions to 220, if Italy had joined the Germans.At the end of a year1s war, in the winter of 1915-1916      inthe months of lovexnber, December, January, and February - westood like this: France had increased from 75 to 105 divisions;Russia had increased from 78 to 100; England had increased from6 to 25, including the effort of the Dominions; Italy had 37,instead of the 36 that I used to think in the old days wouldhe on the opposite side; Serbia had dropped from 8 to 6; and roumania, who did not come in until 1916, brought in 20 divi-sions with her.    If you count at the time when Roumania came into the War, ms. ism instead of 160 divisions we stood at 293;vsrhilst the Germans, who started in with 121 divisions, had 160*the Austrians, who smarted with 61, had now 67; Bulgaria had10 - (Bulgarian divisions are double the size of the others,which makes these 10 equal to 20 of our divisions); and theBurks, who had also entered the War, had 50.    So the enemy hada total of 297 divisions, and we had 293,

Those are the 10 theatres, 9 land and one sea.Looking back for 4 years, it is curious to see the way inwhich the strengths of the Allies and the enemy sway backwardsand for\mrds.In this next room, when I used to he Director ofMilitary Operations before the War, I went into this War agreat many years before it came.

So the enemy hada total of 297 divisions, and we had 293,

.1 will now pass to 1918, the present position.     TheFrench have I think about 106 divisions, that is to say theFrench, have risen from 75 to 106.     We ourselves have risen from 6 divisions to 80, which includes, of course, the effort of the Dominions and India.      Italy has risen from 36 to 50.Serbia keeps constant at 6.    The Greeks have joined with 6,and I have put the Americans at 15 today,      I really do not know quite what the number of American divisions is; itincreases a littlef from day to day.    There are 7 american divisions in the line; we have 5, that is 12; and we have got 5 more behind;hence I have put the number of american divisions at 15.      That gives us a total of 863 divisions.Today the Germans have 242; the Austrians have 79; the bulgarians have 14 - which Is the equivalent of 28 - and theTurks have dropped to 39, giving the enemy a total number of divisions in all theatres of 388 against the Allies&apos; 263.Although Russia is not actually in the War, there are a numberof divisions, both German and Austrian, absorbed in Russia;otherwise that 388 against 263 would make the position very different.     So it &amp; is very interesting to watch, from a soldier&apos;s point of Hew, how we go backwards and forwards.In 1914 we were abcu t 160 to 220, if Italy had joined theGermans according to the old proposal.      In the winter of1915-6 we ran up -if you include Roumania - to 293 divisionsas compared with 297 enemy divisions, and then owing principallyto the enormous effort of Germany the position was 263 Allied&quot;&apos;-&apos;-&apos;divisions to 588 enemy divisions.THE PRIME MINISTER: That Is owing to the withdrawal ofRussia?GENERAL WILSON I Yes, offing to the collapse of Russia4Qn one side there was an emonmous increase of the german divisions from 121 to 242; they exactly doubled their Armyin 4 years.    Still, that is nothing approaching what we

ourselves have done.     1 have got just a few figures toshow you which I thought might interest you.In August 1914, when we started this War, we ,had13,820 regular officers.     We have at the present moment220,770 - I call every officer a regular officer now - soit is scarcely a. fair comparison, and yet it is really so,to compare 15,820 with 220,770.      We have lost 32,000 officersup to today, that is to say nearly three times our totalestablishment of officers.     Another 8,000 have been perma-nently disabled.    Thus we have lost a total of 40,000 officersWe have 220,770 inthe field at the present moment.    I.do notthink there is anything in history at all like this.     I have&apos;discussed this very subject with G-eneral Foch and he always&quot;says there is nothing in history at all like the expansion ofthe British Army in the time.As regards guns, we started this War in 1914 with 486gunsj    in Prance today, we have 8,271, which does not Includema chine guns&quot;..The only other figure I was going to give you was the educational side of this enormous ^a&amp;hine.    We always hada certain number of schools of coux*se, ?ftiich are still kept up in England; but we have added 192 military schools Inorder to train officers, and we have at these schools at thepresent moment 65,420 officers and Non-Commissioned Officers,who are going to become officers.     That will give some idea-Of the enormous effort that has been made.A separate paper has been prepared in 2&apos;egard to the effort of the Dominions, to which I referred at the beginning,wo I will not say anything further on that point now, as Ithink the Prime Minister himself Is going to say somethinglater about the tremendous effort of the Dominions. Justrunning roughly over the various theatres brings me to theend of the first part.How 1 should just like to say what I think of the

strategy of this War *     It does not follow that because 1 thinkit it is rightj but it does not follow either that it is wrong,I always thought and still think - If my language is more thatof a soldier than^o&apos;f a statesman you will forgive me - that theBoche would go into this war- with two objects, first, to get   ahold of the salt water everywhere, and second to take the near east.     We used to h. ave long discussions about this years beforethe war, especially I think with the Prime Minister and theMinister of Munitions.     In order to get possession of the seaI believe his original idea, as it certainly was, I think, ours,mine at any rate, was to capture those ports.     I thought, too,that the way he would get to the near East would he this way,by Aleppo and Jerusalem, and by that way at the head of thePersian Gulf.     Now we soldiers have one advantage over you,that is we have no miorals whatever of any description, andtherefore as the Baches were all soldiers I gave them the credit of having no morals at all; that is to say, 1 gave them the credit of thinking that they would go to war whenever it suitedthem, not whether it was right or wrong, hut whether it wouldsuit them or would not suit them.     Well, for various reasonsthey went to war in August 1914j and I think they were quite clear and probably quite right in thinking that they would get a decision quickly.     I certainly thought a quick decision wouldbe reached.     1 did not think the war would be over soon, but 1thought a decision would he reached on one side or the other inthe first six months, and I think most peiple thought so too.Those who knew the pprohlem best thought so most, 1 think.    TheBoche did.     When I used to be constantly in Germany and Francetwenty years before the war 1 talked often on this subject, both with the French and,with the Germans, and 1 think all of usthought that within six months a decision of some sort - not theend of the war, but it would he,clear who was going to win -would be reached.

x want to advance what I believe to he the differencebetween the two strategies of the two opposing sides.       we the waysoldiers have a sort of formula in which we say that/to win awar is to bring decisive numbers to a decisive place at a decisive time.     The Boches say exactly the same thing inGermany.     How what did they do?     They put the1 hulk of their forces, 84 of the 121 divisions which they had in August, 1914,at least as far as we can make out, on&apos; this side.    The line inthose days was like that.-   That is the old Duchy of Luxembourg,this is Holland of course coming down to that corner.   As I say, &quot;there were from 84 to 90 divisions out of 131.      The Germans had put the others up against the Russians.     Well, they set to workto get a decision at once and they as near as made no matter gotit.      That   is the line today, hut the line In 1914 - I personallywas with Field Marshal Lord French here -   and the French lineran out there.     The Boches, of course, were in Amiens and theywere all over this country here.     The ports were entirel?/ attheir mercy.      It is very difficult to sa;y now why they did notoccupy the ports.      I think the reason probably - we will find out one day - is that they had not got enough troops.     every single available man was employed in this desperate attack infollo?committing  up the French and British in their retreat.     It wasa very hot summer and we.were all exhausted, including the Boches,They failed therefore to get their decision in August and only just failed.     At the beginning of September we managed to turn round and fought the battle of the Marne.    The Boche knew Suite?*ell that he had not got his decision.    Be said; Well, I willhave a go now for -fe the ports.    And then there came that racefcem the Marne stretching up to the sea.     It was a most

extraordinary race, each aide thinning out divisions up and down the line, and racing them up and down the line, we to our left,they to their right as hard as ever they could go, by train, by&apos;bus, and by every conceivable thing, and yet of course holdingprevented a decision.     As f ar as I can see, looking at it throughGerman spectacles, they thought they would get thei-r decision inAugust 1914.      I want to say here that I do not think that theBoche - I do not think that we ourselves - had any idea of the november and December of 1914,      The beginning of October and november 1914 settled the fete of the ports.     The Boche thereforehad made two drives for a decision, one against Prance, as it were.,and one against the ports., and had just failed each time.      Whatdid he do then?     It seems to me that he said:    I cannot get adecision there, I am not strong enough, so what I will do is this,I will go and see if I can knock out somebody else and then we will withdraw toops and presently bring them back here and thenget a decision.     He left on this front what he considered asufficient number of troops to block us and the French and thenset to work on an outside campaign to knock out other people witha view presently, he did not know when, to bring back sufficienttroops to try again to get a decision.      So what you find is this:Having failed in August, September, October and November to obtain&apos;a decision in France, in the middle of November he is setting towork in Russia.     He works against Russia from November 1914 till   &apos;October 1915.     His first big drive in Russia, is from November 1914to February 1915 and then again in May to October he is fightinghard in Galicia, first in the North and then in the South.    later in the same year from November 1915 to .April 1916 we find himfighting in the Persian Gulf, always pushing out that side or downto the South - always trying to knock oirt that side and keep quiethere, with a single exception, to which 1 will refer later.   Fromthe line all the time, and in the end, as you know, we justfuture of the submarine at that timein September, October,

October 1916 to January 1917 he really does achieve a bigthing, and knocks out Roumania, and by March he had got theRussian Revolution going and the whole of that side was finishedreally.     After making attempts in Persia and after trying; to seize the Suez Canal, we come to the one exception., which wasvery cnirious - 1 have no idea, and I do not think anybody has,why he did it - that tremendous attack which he made at Verdunon February 21st, 1916.     He may have thought if he took the fortress of Verdun he would really knock out the French nation,or whether it was that the Crown Prince may have wanted sometm$M-zst in Germany I do not know, but it was a very terrible4fight which lasted from February 21st till the following October.The German attack at Verdun was iiamensely relieved by our bigoffensive on the Somme on July 1st.The Boche1s idea of strategy was that he wanted a decisiveplace at a decisive time and he thought that he had it in August1914.     He tried and failed but he nearly got his delesIon.&quot;  1do not think anybody who was not there knows how nearly he gotit.     Then we fought the battle of the Marne which pushed him.back.     He fights again here and fails and then gives it up.He blocks that line and then trams his attention to other theatres.     low at the end of four years he is going to try it again, but this time with about 205 divisions instead of 84 asin 1914.     That is the picture that 1 see of German strategy -decisive numbers at a decisive place at a decisive time - everysoldier agrees to that.7

Svery soldier, I think, agrees that this is the decisive theatreso long as the bulk of the troops on both sides are concentratedalong that front.     Where we differed, the Allies and the Boehe,was in regard to time.     They thought they had the right time inAugust, 1914;    they were just wrong.     They thought they had it again in October and Hoveraber, 1914, and except Yerdun, which I&apos;do not understand, they never tried it again till the 21st ofMarch of this year.     low they are saying again;    we havedecisive numbers, this is the decisive theatre,   we call thetime;    and they called the time on the 21st March.     The Alliesdid differently to that, the Allies, I said:    this is the decisive theatre and so everything must be poured into this theatre and then, on different occasions, although they did not actually say it, I think they acted in a way that makes one thinkthat they were saying it inside themselves:   this is &amp;he decisivetheatre, we have the decisive numbers, now we will try.     Wehad, of course, two very notable exceptions;   one was theDardanelles, and the other was Salonika.     With this exception, -practically speeking, as much as possible of troops, guns, indeedeverything, were poured into France and on several occasions theAllies attempted to gain real decisions;   the fissgtet of decisionsthat the Boche tried to get in August, 1914.     I have got a listof them here, but some of them look so small now.     There isHeuve Ohapelle, and also Yimy,in 1915.     We tried again in 1915at Loos, and the French in the Ohampagne.     In 1916 the enemy, ofcourse, made the French fight at Yerdun, and then we relievedthat pressure by ourselves trying to get a decision on the Sommein the same year, and last year we tried several times to get.a real decision in favour of ourselves.     We tried at Arras, Vimy;the French tried at the Aisne and in the Ohampagne.     We tried -though perhaps it is. hardly fair to say so - at Messines;    I

think we tried also in flanders and in a limited way the Frenchagain tried on the Chemin-des-Dames, and we tried lastly in iovemberof last year at Cambrai.     I think the difference between thetwo strategies then is this:  -the Germans thought that they could get a decision in August, 1914 and went to war straight away, and,from a soldiers point of view, quite rightly.     They failed.They tried again there and failed again,     They blocked that place, and they never made another attempt,except at Terdun,ss&amp;ecks: worth talking about,     they  devoted themselves to offensivesin other theatres and then, on the 21st of March they came backto the Western front and again tried for exactly the same classof decision as they tried for in 1914.     It is very nearlyfair and it is very nearly true to say this^that, when we tookBullecotirt, a little village, at the end of the Somrae fight, theBoche took Roumania;   when we took Ifessines, they took Russia;and when we took Passchendaele, they very nearly knocked outItaly in the same months.     iind our decisions, or attempts atthem were here, all theirs being out on that side.I have now come to the last little point,\7s,&apos;   &quot;\s\\

I will now refer to some of the difficulties which theAllies have experienced.      The Germans have had their difficultiestoo I am sure, but I think we have got more.     First all, weEnglish expanded in this amazing way, then the Dominions cameand helped us and had to come very long journeys.     Then we had great difficulties in regard to the blockade.     We have had all along great difficulties with the submarines.     From everytheatre, whether it is the Americans transporting their men, orsomething coming from South. America, or   whether it is somethingcoming; from Australia or whatever it is the distances aretremendous.      We have had a certain amount of difficulty inregard to Ireland.    We have had a certain number of strikes,though I fancy that these are in common with our enemy, because we hear anyhow that they have great difficulties in regard to&apos;strikes in Germany.     Also from the beginning of the war, fromthe first part of the war certainly, we failed to realise what this war meant.     Some of these difficulties I think the germans have not got.     They have got others 1 daresay of their own, butI think on the whole ours is the longer list of difficulties.Then France, whe has I think three principal difficulties to contend with.    One is the loss of this territory, which produceslarge supplies of c2ial and contains, I believe, nine tenths ofhere steel works, or something like that, with the town of Lille,the greatest of all centres, which is a terrible loss to France.aThen France has. always had/difficulty, which we have not got,on matters like that with which M. Caillaux was concerned.Italy has also had great political difficulty, such as thatconcerning Signor Giolitti of which I am not a judge.     Butthey have had another difficulty which we have had - I thinkall of us have had, although I do not pretend to criticise -that is, the Pope.. -   Italy, in addition, has had one.further difficulty more than France or us, and that is the shape ofher frontier which, has governed the whole of her action in this war.     She starts with a frontier like that and she has kept on

pushing out that   way with the result that any threat that waypoint of view the Italian frontier is a shocking one, which makes their position exceedingly difficult.With regard to Russia, Russia had her own peculiar diffi-cultiesj perhaps the main difficulty was corruption.     I rememberthe last time I was in Russia before the war going round someto build some mobilisation stores and had built them. He hadbuilt some sheds but had. forgotten to put down a concrete floor.Consequently all the leather and the whole mobilisation/wereabsolutely rotten.     Everything was a. mass of corruption.    Russiatoo had this difficulty, only not so acute, but still the samesort of difficulty, in regard to her frontier, which is like that.Consequently the Austrians were able to go in there and theGermans were able to go in there        This frontier (Russian)presents the same sort of difficulty as that  (Italian) but inthe former there ismmore room.     That is a strong form offrontier If this fellow can mobilise quickest.    If, on the otherhand, as in this case, this fellow takes seven weeks to mobilise,when it took the Germans nine days, it puts him into exactly the opposite position.     In the case of a frontier of this sortyou want very rapid powers of mobilisation.    Lastly Russia hadno mechanics.    The bulk of the mechanics in Russia were Bo-ehe,and when they came back to Germany the bulk of the works inRussia fell down and never recovered.     Consequently they couldnot turn out munitions.    When Lord Milner and I were in Russialast year they were turning out, I believe, one aeroplane amonth or one a week.Then, common to all the Allies, we had, exterior lines allthe time and have still and the enemy has interior lines,     Then,in addition, in common to us but not to them, we have no unity of command.    I do not think it is fair to say that the Germansterrified the wits out of her and it does now.Prom a soldier sxnobilisation stores in Poland.stores

command the Austrians although they come awfully near it.      until recently we really did fight three wars - ourselves against theGermans, the French against the Germans, and the Italians againstthe Germans.     General Foch as joxx know has been made General-in-Chief.      I have known him intimately for twelve years j    I have worked with him for this war for twelve years.     He Is a very,very fine soldier,; and an absolutely glorious fighfeer - the mostglorious fighter I have ever seen.In a paper which is to be circulated by the War office which goes into more detail, I give at the,end the possibilityfor the future.    &apos;. Of course we have to look at things even ifthey are not very; nice.      The best we can hope for, for the minute, is that that line shall remain something like it is now. ,The worst that we-can expect would be for that line to be broken,for the French to&quot;run out and for our forces to be pinned up against the ports.      That is the best and that is the worst.    Itseems to me that for another two months we have got a very, very anxious time.      It is not possible to say what is going to happen,If this day two months we are standing approximately on our presentline 1 think the anxiety will begin to pass, partly because ofthe enormous increase in the American troops, and partly becauseof the large numbers which we, here in England, are again goingto put into the field owing to this last Bill that has been passed.Two months later than that, according to my calculations - thatmakes it the end of October or the beginning of Movember - the anxiety ovight to be passed as regards that front, but between-theday when all anxiety is over and the day when, chiefly owing tothe Americans and ourselves, all of us, we say?    This is the decisive theatre, we have the decisive numbers, now we will try -between those two days there is a long period.A.S regards^ Italy, the Italians ought to be able to standthere.    There is no difficulty about it;    they have got very goodlines and the numbers&apos; are equal.     They really ought to kill all those Austrians.

There is a country there that always gives me a greatdeal of trouble - I refer to Switzerland.      So far she hasnot moved at all.      She occasionally shouts for coal, or ivheator something, but does not take any side.     There is another country which I do not wish to say much about as that chieflyconcerns the Admiralty - I refer to Holland,Of course, as I said before, there is all this Siberianand Caucasus side to be dealt with up here.As regards the future - I am speaking as a soldier - I want to see us established along the Rhine j but it seems tome that if we do get ourselves into that pass, that is notgetting a real decision on this front.     It seems to me we(the East)have to get a position on this side/as well as on the west.If that is so, we have got to get everybody to help, and wemust get the Japanese,     I can see no other way out of it.No military dicislon, as far as I can see, that we can gethere now will settle the east.     It is for that reason thatI think that between the days when all anxiety is- past, this autumn and the time when we throw down the glove here for a/--final clinch we ought to exploit the outside theatres as muchas we can, so that at the Peace Conference we, the Britishanyhow, will not be so badly off.8, Whitehall Gardens,18th June, 1918.*
