PROCEDURE AT INTER-ALLIED AND PEACE CONFERENCE.The Prime Minister, after welcoming Sir R. Borden and Sir G. Foster, said: Itseems to have been finally decided that President Wilson should come over to Europe,and I do not think that any discussion can usefully take place between the Allies until he arrives. Although Colonel House faithfully represents the Presidents views, I donot think he would dream of discussing, in the Presidents absence, any of these important points.   I think that is Lord Reading&apos;s view also.Lord Reading: Yes.The Prime Minister: In this connection the following telegram, which has just been received from Lord Derby (1526), is interesting : &quot; Colonel House been to see me and tells me President is issuing a note to america stating it is his intention to leave for France directly after assembly of congress, i.e., he leaves on 3rd December. He will state in note American&quot; Commissioners will be appointed to attend Peace Conference, but says nothingabout attending it himself, leaving that for moment an open question.&quot; Colonel House begs that this information may be treated as strictly confi-dential, as he does not know exactly when note will be published in America. as you will have seen by his message to His Majesty, President intends to come direct to France.&quot; Colonel House very anxious to know at once whether you assent to Versaillesbeing meeting place for Conference ; as all American stationery has to be printed inAmerica, they are completely hung up until they know whether you agree. Pleasewire. He also asks me to put you following question : Chief of the General Staffspoke to Mr. Frazier at last meeting suggesting that official language of theConference should be English. Do you agree to colonel House putting thisforward as joint request from British and American Governments ? He thinks thatif&quot; we concede place of meeting to Fiance they might be willing to concede choice of language to us.&quot;The Prime Minister continued : As M. Clemenceau and also, possibly, Sr. Orlandowill be here on the 1st December, which means that we shall have a discussion withthem on *the 2nd, we ought, between now and then, to have a full discussion amongstourselves as to the line we are going to take. There are two or three questions we arenot clear about; for instance, if you will remember, there is Palestine and East Africa,and two or three questions of that kind. We have not quite settled either in our minds what sort of government we intend setting up in Mesopotamia. Then there is theeconomic question, and to what extent we shall impose restrictions upon the export ofraw material to Germany, and for what period of time. I am only indicating a few of the questions, but there may be others. I do not know whether we can discuss these to-day. There is also the important question of representation. We have to putforward our own suggestions as to the&apos; number of representatives. I know that inM. Clemenceau&apos;s view there ought to be five. That was Colonel House&apos;s view also.Still, that was not put forward by them officially, but was only mentioned informallyin the course of a conversation I had with these two gentlemen. As a matter of fact,the Conference had broken up when they actually suggested it, and it is only, therefore,some sort of idea of what they have in their minds. There must be a certain numberof permanent delegates, and there may be delegates who will come there ad hoc todiscuss certain specific questions which affect their own particular Dominions. That isone suggestion, but all these suggestions can be discussed between now and the 2ndDecember, when the French and Italian Prime Ministers will be over here, and conceivablyColonel House also, although I am not sure. Meanwhile I do not know whether thereis anything to be gained by taking up time by discussing this to-day. What do you think, Foreign Secretary ?Mr. Balfour: I should not think there was very much ; I think it will have to beprepared, and if you wish to discuss the fate of the Emperor of Germany this morning,I do not think we have too much time.Mr. Barnes : Might I refer to a question arising on this ? I had a memorandum from the Foreign Office asking my advice about an International Conference; I assumeit is the same one that the Labour men put to the Prime Minister. I answered theForeign  Office that, in my judgment, it would do more harm than good to refuse
passports (to Prime Minister) You remember you said you would discuss it with o rAllies and the Dominions.The Prime Minister: You can put that down for discussion too.Mr. Barnes : I merely mention it now, because if you are going to issue passports,the sooner you do so the better, in order to give them sufficient time.Sir Robert Borden : It is necessary for us to confer and decide as to what we are going to propose at the Peace Conference, or, rather, what we are going to propose to the Inter-Allied Conference.The Prime Minister : Which is the really important Conference.       .Sir Robert Borden : There are two subjects upon which it is possible we may have some difficulty with America. I have taken some pains, as you know, to ascertain the attitude of the United States of America, and, more particularly, of the Presidenthimself on certain questions. He expects, as I understand, to have some difficultyrespecting the Freedom of the Seas whatever he may mean by that I do not know and the retention of the German colonies. It is certain that he has strong feelingsupon the first question, and probably upon the second his views are.equally fixed. Itwould seem very desirable that we should have before us a brief or memorandum on thequestion of the Freedom of the Seas, examining it from the historical aspect, from the strategic aspect, and from the legal aspect, so that the various considerations will bebefore us in a form readily available. As to the second question, you know,Prime Minister, that I suggested to you by telegram the great importance of having the Dominions themselves, who are particularly interested, put forward their claim strongly, so that it will come rather from them than the Government of theUnited Kingdom. Persons wjio are very closely in touch with affairs in Americahave urged that upon me. I was informed that those claims would present lessdifficulty if they were put forward insistently and urgently on behalf of Australia, NewZealand, and South Africa, rather than by the United Kingdom itself. I think this is really all I have to say. . .The Prime Minister: With regard to the first question, namely, the Freedom ofthe Seas, I think that is an admirable suggestion of Sir Robert Borden. I suggest that either the Admiralty should collaborate with the Law Officers or that the Law officers should prepare a Paper of their own. On the whole I think perhaps the Law officers should prepare a Paper of their own dealing with the historical and the legal side, andthe Admiralty can deal with the strategical side.Admiral Wemyss: With a view, I suppose, to ultimately merging the Law Officers&apos;Paper into the Admiralty Paper.The Prime Minister: You prepare your Paper independently7 and the Law officers will prepare theirs.With regard to the German colonies, I also think that is a very admirable suggestion of Sir Robert Borden, and that is why I venture to put forward the suggestion thatwhen you come to the case, say, of Australia, or the case of New Zealand, or the case ofSouth Africa, that the case should be presented by the representatives of these particular Dominions at the Inter-Allied Conference, which is a thing that matters.If we come to an agreement at the Inter- Allied Conference we are really in a position to dictate terms afterwards. Of course, we shall have to discuss the question afterwards,but then it will only be a discussion with a view to making concessions. We haveGermany entirely at our mercy, and if we can agree amongst ourselves upon a particularpolicy, we could then dictate, and that is why the Inter-Allied Conference is theimportant one, and at that Conference I think the Dominions ought to be represented the particular Dominion which is concerned in the special German colony underconsideration should be represented to present its own case. I did venture to put before Colonel House the view of the British Government, and I told Mr. Hughes that about a fortnight ago. I told Colonel House quite specifically that the view of theBritish Government was that none of these colonies should be restored to Germany,and that the colonies which had been captured by Australian, or New Zealand, or SouthAfrican troops, with the exception of East Africa, which I put in a different category,as a subject for further discussion, would have to be held by the Dominions which had captured them. I said that was the view of the British Government, and that statementhas already been made public by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.
Lord Reading: The retention of the German colonies should be based on the viewof the Dominions themselves.The Prime Minister: On the view of the Dominions, which are not, in any sense ofthe term, colonies, but independent communities who are acting in co-operation with us.Sir Robert Borden : There is another suggestion which was mentioned to me in regardto any colony that might not be handed back to Germany, East Africa, for example,but might not be retained by or incorporated in the British Empire. I under-stand the President is very strongly of the opinion that it would never do to haveinternational control.The Prime Minister: Of the colonies ?Sir Robert Borden : Of East Africa, for example.Mr. Balfour : Of anything.Sir Robert Borden: His reason is that there would be the danger of friction..His theory, as far as I can learn it, and the information comes from a pretty reliable source, is this : he thinks a colony like East Africa, which is not to be handed back toGermany, should be placed under the control of some minor Power whose possessionof it would not arouse any ill-feeling or jealousy.The Prime Minister: That has not worked very well in the case of the Congo.Mr. Chamberlain: Or in the case of the Dutch Colonies. I do not think you will find the treatment of the native in the Dutch Colonies is very good.Lord Curzon:  I do not think the President means to push that.   You will remember in a telegram that came the other day from America some indication wasgiven that some small neutral State should be put in charge.   I mentioned this to-Colonel House, and gave some of the illustrations which have already been used.Colonel House said that he had never heard the President say that.The Prime Minister: I do not think he has thought it out.Lord Reading: I do not think these views ought to be taken too seriously.The Prime Minister: In the course of a conversation I had with Colonel House Igathered that his view was that America could not run colonies.   Their experimentwith the Philippines had not been a great success.   You required a special knack of&apos;handling colonies which did not interfere with the people of those colonies, and whichallowed them to run their&apos; own way.Mr. Hughes: You do not propose to discuss this to-day ?The Prime Minister: I am entirely in the hands of the War Cabinet.Mr. Hughes: I have one or two points to make which we can discuss later. Ithink if you are going to deal with the ex-Kaiser in his present position we should discuss that question now.Mr. Montagu: In the arrangements which you are discussing this morning, are youdiscussing the negotiations for peace with Germany only or the negotiations with turkey and Austria at the same time ?The Prime Minister: Oh, certainly, all at the same time ; that is why I mentionedMesopotamia and Palestine.Mr. Balfour : A telegram has been received this morning from America to theeffect that the President did not want any preliminary conference at all, but it is rather difficult to know what he means exactly. We must have a preliminary conference. For the President to think we should have a conference at which will be present the Germans, the Austrians, and the Turks, and we have to fight out thesequestions before them, in the first instance, he cannot really have given his brains tothe subject, and I think it is a grotesque proposal.The.Prime Minister : He probably does not want to have a formal conference.Lord Reading : He is afraid of it being said that there has been a secret conference..The Prime Minister: I do not think we had better proceed with this discussionfurther at present.
TREATMENT OF PRISONERS OF WAR.Lord Gurzon: This is a draft telegram about prisoners to which I invite theapproval of the War Cabinet; &quot; Information reaches His Majesty&apos;s Government of shocking lack of organi-sation in release of British prisoners in German territory, and of their returnmarch on foot, miserably clothed, without food or transport, and with no escort orguides, to the Allied lines, with the result of lamentable suffering and heavymortality. His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot tolerate continuation of this crueltreatment, and must insist on adequate arrangements being made, in all above-respects, by German authorities with whom responsibility lies. Otherwise weshall be compelled to take this into account in any question of revictuallingGermany or satisfying requirements of German population. His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment are ready to lend all available assistance by forwarding food, clothing, andtransport to prisoners&apos; camps, where they are not otherwise forthcoming, and areaddressing.Allied Commanders in this sense.The Prime Minister: Sir Maurice Hankey will now read the conclusions on thissubject.(Sir Maurice Hankey then read to the War Cabinet the following conclusions.)&quot;(a.) The Admiralty, on behalf of the British Government, should send thefollowing wireless telegraph message en clair to the GermanGovernment&quot;: (Then insert the telegram prepared by Lord Gurzon.)&quot; (b.) The War Office should call the attention of Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haigto this message, and should direct him to make all possible arrangements to push forward food, clothing, transport, and other relief measures in advanceof the British lines to assist the released prisoners ; he should make such com-munications to General Haking as he thinks advisable, and arrange with marshal Foch and General Persfiing for corresponding action in advance ofthe French and American lines.&quot; (c.) That the Foreign Office should repeat to the French Government the message quoted in (a), and should ask them to take corresponding action.&quot; (d.) That a statement on the subject should be made in both Houses ofParliament this afternoon.&quot;Mr. Hughes: I do not think that &quot; in advance of the British lines&quot; goes far enough. &apos; You want to say &quot;to the prisoners,&quot; &quot;to the camps,&quot; and &quot;to the menen route.&apos;&quot;The Prime Minister: &quot; Between the camps and the British lines.&quot;Sir Eric Geddes : I understand the discussion to apply to prisoners within 50 or60 miles of the British lines, but this covers everybody all over Germany.The Prime Minister: We must see that prisoners, wherever they come from,are properly fed.   I think we must take the responsibility right through.(The Conclusions, as finally approved, are as follows.)(a.) The Admiralty, on behalf of the British Government, should send thefollowing W/T message en clair to the German Government : &quot; Information reaches His Majesty&apos;s Government of shocking lackoforganisation in release of British prisoners in German territory, and oftheir return march on foot, miserably clothed, without food or transport,and with no escort or guides, to the Allied lines, with the result oflamentable suffering and heavy mortality. His Majesty&apos;s government cannot tolerate continuation of this cruel treatment, and must insist onadequate, arrangements being made, in all above respects, by german authorities with whom responsibility lies. Otherwise we shall be compelled to take . this into account in any question of re-victuallingGermany or satisfying requirements of German population. His-Majesty&apos;s[543-9] C
Government are ready to lend all available assistance by forwarding food,clothing, and transport to prisoners&apos; camps, where they are not otherwiseforthcoming, and are addressing Allied commanders in this sense.&quot;(&amp;.) The War Office should call the attention of Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Ffaigto this message, and should direct him to make all possible arrangements to assist the released prisoners, by pushing forward food, clothing, transport,and other relief measures, between the British lines and the prisoners&apos;camps; he should make such communications to General Haking as he thinks advisable on this subject, and should concert with Marshal Foch andGeneral Pershing for corresponding action by the French and AmericanArmies.(c.) The Foreign Office should repeat to the French Government the messagequoted in (a), and should ask them to take corresponding action.(cZ.) A statement on the subject should be made in both Houses of Parliament that afternoon.MESSAGE FROM PANAMA NEGROES.The Prime Minister: I do not know whether the members of the War CabinetTaave seen this telegram from the Association of Universal.Loyal Negroes of Panama,but I will read it :-&apos;&apos;-&apos;.&quot;&apos;..-&apos;/ - -&quot; Negroes throughout Republic Panama send congratulations on victory and inreturn for services rendered by negroes throughout the world in fighting and freedom of all the nations beg that their heritage wrested from Germany in Africamay become the negro national home with self-government.&quot;ATTITUDE TOWARDS EX-KAISER.Lord Curzon &apos;: While in Paris last week I had a conversation with M. Clemenceauwith regard to what the attitude of the Allied Governments should be towards theex-Kaiser. I do not think I need argue the case about the desirability, still less thefairness, or the equity of trying him and the Crown Prince. We know the war was started by the Kaiser, and we have reason to believe that all the cruelty, the iniquities,and the horrors that have been perpetrated, if not directly inspired by him, have beencountenanced and in no way discouraged by him. In my view the Kaiser is thearch-criminal of the world, and just as in any other sphere of life when you get hold ofa criminal you bring him to justice, so I do not see, because he is an Emperor and living in exile in another country, why he should be saved from the punishment whichis his due. When I spoke to M. Clemenceau about the matter he said that, as far,as he. knew, the French jurists had not looked at it from the point of view ofinternational law and of the questions that will arise in respect of internment and extra-dition, but he said public opinion in France, as represented by the press, was strongly in favour of steps being taken tor the trial of the Kaiser and that he himself sharedthat view, although he would be very glad to hear from our Government what our ideaswere on the subject. He then discussed the form which such a tribunal might take ;I think he had the idea of an international tribunal, composed not only of delegates from Allied countries which have taken part in the recent war but of neutrals as well.He discussed the two conditions; first, of a successful demand for the person of the kaiser himself and putting him up for trial before a body to which he himself couldanswer for his misdeeds ; and the other was the question of the trial taking place in theabsence of the Kaiser, supposing we were unable to get him from Holland? He did notthink that would be a fatal bar. He thought the terms of indictment might be drawnup and that they might be sent to the Kaiser, if we could not get hold of him. Asregards punishment, the idea which he mentioned I do not think he said much aboutexecution ; I do not think that entered into our minds was that of treating the Kaiser asa universal outlaw so that there should be no land in which he could set his foot. these were the general views that he put forward, and he awaited further information from us. There were two other points mentioned. One was that as we all hoped that a league of Nations would emerge from this war, would it not be really a great act ofinitiation if the first step that would really call the League of Nations in an effectivemanner into being, should be an act of justice taken by the world as a whole. I saw the Attorney-General this morniug On my way to the Cabinet. You will rememberwe referred to him some time ago the question of constituting a tribunal for the trial of alL^jjhose persons who have been guilty of such acts of murder as that of Nurse
Cavell and Captain Fryatt. I asked whether his Committee were considering thequestion of trying the Kaiser ? He said they had not approached it yet, but that themajority of the Committee and it is an effective Committee, as we know werein favour of that course, and would submit a recommendation to that effect and put before the War Cabinet the scheme of a tribunal by which it might be done. On apoint of law, I imagine that any action taken for getting hold of the Kaiser should betaken now; that is to say, it must be taken before the Peace Conference. He wouldbe a prisoner of war now, but if you postponed it till after the Peace Conference youmight not get him at all. That seems a reason why we should come to some decision at once.   I have not thought it necessary to argue the case on its merits.The Prime Minister : I do not know why we should prescribe limits of punishmentsat the present stage. If he is guilty at all then he is guilty of a criminal offence. Hehas put to death hundreds of thousands of prime young fellows from this country andall over the world. He has been responsible for the deaths of several millions. he did it very recklessly, and a still greater culprit is the Crown Prince, who had beenadvocating this war for many years, and who hailed it with joy when it started. these people have been very irresponsible. Kings have been tried and executed for offenceswhich are not comparable with the offences which these two culprits have been guilty of, and I think rulers who plunge the world into all this misery ought to be warned forall time that they must pay the penalty sooner or later. I do not think it is sufficientpunishment to this man that he should get away with twenty millions of money, as i see is stated, to Holland or Corfu, or wherever he goes. I think he ought to stand histrial. With regard to the question of international law, well, we are making inter-national law, and all we can claim is that international law should be based on justice.I think if we demanded this man, if he is not responsible, he could then make his case. The League of Nations is a Committee composed either of diplomats or states-men, but this ought to be a judicial tribunal which should be set up by the Allies.Germany ought to be invited to join in it, and I have no doubt she will send men,in her present state, who will judo-e the ex-Kaiser very impartially. There is a sense of justice in the world which will not be satisfied so long as this man is at large.Lord Gurzon: It was M. Clemenceau&apos;s view that if the nations set up this tribunala League of Nations will be in existence, and this will be its first act.Mr. Barnes : I am doubtful if neutrals should be represented. They have nothelped much in this war, and some of them are distinctly pro-German.The Prime Minister : This demand, if made, should be put forward promptly, andif Holland wishes to come into the community of&apos; nations she must do so on the under-standing that she does not shelter men who are guilty of crimes against internationallaw. I am perfectly certain that under pressure Holland would give up these twocriminals, and the sooner they are tried, I think, the better. I support the suggestion of Lord Curzon that we should make representations of this kind to our Allies andassociates in this war.Mr. Long: I suppose any men whose names have been given as committingatrocities, like some of the men at Lille and Ostend, will be included with the kaiser.The Prime Minister: That is a trial for specific acts, like the murder of CaptainFryatt.   That is a thing for negotiation with Germany at the Peace Conference.Mr. Long : We have the actual names of the men whom we know to have committedcrimes.General Smuts : The people mentioned by Mr. Long have actually committedcrimes, but there seems to be some difficulty in regard to the Kaiser as to whether he has actually committed crimes, and I should like to hear what the legal officers have to say.The Prime Minister: The crime for which he is responsible is plunging this worldinto war.Sir RobeH Borden:&apos; It is a crime against humanity.Mr. Hughes : I think you should be sufficiently general in your remarks to prevent us being thrown on the rocks.   You cannot indict a man for making war.   War has
*been the prerogative of. the right of all nations from the beginning, and if you say, well,,as the result of this war, millions have died, you can say&apos; that much of Alexander and ofMoses and of almost anybody.The Prime Minister: I am not sure that they also ought not to be brought to-justice!Mr. Hughes: If you say that it is a good thing that he should die, let us say so,but yon cannot say he should die because he plunged the world into war, because hehad a perfect right to plunge the world into war, and now we have conquered, we havea perfect right to kill him, not because he plunged the world into war, but . because we have won. You cannot indict him, Mr. Prime Minister, for breaking the law. Ihave no doubt a principal is responsible for the acts of his agents. Let him be tried for those acts ; let him be condemned.Mr. Churchill: According to that, any General commanding a force of which oneprivate soldier commits a gross act of war ought to be committed for trial which isabsurd. I agree with Mr. Hughes that it is within our rights to kill him as an act ofvengeance, but it does seem to me, if you are going to deal with him on the basis ofwhat is called justice and law, it is difficult to say that the ex-Kaiser&apos;s guilt is greaterthan the guilt of a great many very important persons in Germany who supportedhim, including the Parliament of the nation, which supported him unanimously. Itdoes seem to me that you might easily set out hopefully on the path of hanging theex-Kaiser and have general public interest taken in it, but after a time you might findyou were in a very great impasse, and the lawyers all over the world would begin to seethat the indictment was one which was not capable of being sustained. It might even be found that the ex-Kaiser was not altogether a free agent and that he was carriedaway by the tremendous influences around him. I think it should be looked at very carefully by the Government before committing itself to any decision.Sir Robert Borden: You might try him for a crime against humanity very muchin the same way that Napoleon was banished to St. Helena. Napoleon was not formally tried. They banished him first to Elba, from which he escaped, and finallythey sent him to St. Helena.Lord Gurzon: They captured him first.Sir Robert Borden : What Mr. Churchill says is quite pertinent. I was informed by the Duke of Connaught that before the war broke out the Kaiser sent a message to each of the German sovereigns, and that every one of them supported him inhis idea of making war with the exception of the King of Wurtemburg. They are allpretty much in the same boat as the ex-Kaiser, and so are the men who have perhapsbeen forcing the ex-Kaiser&apos;s hand all the time, because, from what we learn, he was against war up to a certain time. Y. ou remember that despatch from the french ambassador at Berlin, which I believe was not really an official despatch in the first,instance, but which was afterwards made official.Lord Reading: The first question is : Is it feasible to prosecute him at all if you.can get him ? That is a question about which you must make up your minds before you take action. You must not start out by indicting him for committing a crimeagainst humanity, and then find it is impossible to carry it through.The Prime Minister : What do you mean by &quot; impossible &quot; ?Lord Reading: That you could not charge him because there is no offence.The Prime Minister: You mean a legal offence ?Lord Reading: I mean an offence upon which anybody can agree.Hie Prime Minister: Surely, if the charge against him is that he is responsible forplunging the world into this war, it is possible to make a case.Lord Reading: I am not arguing against it, but I see. very great difficulties, andall I am saying is that I think we ought to be careful to know what we are doingbefore we make any representation It may be that you could try him for that, or foran offence against international law, on which you have a better case, but the firstthing you have to determine is whether it is feasible to prosecute him either for the oneor for the other.
The Prime Minister: I do not understand that; you could set up a tribunal,surely.Lord Reading: By agreement.The Prime Minister: Yes, that is what I mean.Lord Heading : You must say what the tribunal is to try him for, and if you wanthim at the present moment you must be prepared to say to Holland under what chargethey have to deliver him up.The Prime Minister : To stand his trial.Lord Reading : Then you must make up your mind that that is the charge.Mr. Chamberlain: Is there not another danger ? We have not done with theGerman people yet. They are in a state of flux and transition. What is going to emerge from the welter I do not know. Any of us would be rash at this moment toprophesy. When you go back to the beginning of the war, I think it is impossibleto distinguish the guilt of the ex-Kaiser from the guilt of the people who welcomed andapplauded and supported him throughout. If you are going to treat the ex-Kaiser asthe sole root of evil, you are going to acquit the German people. I think it is too early to do that before you are satisfied that their change of mind and heart is complete and permanent. I think there is a great danger for our own people in our teaching themthat the ex-Kaiser alone was to blame and that the German people were as innocent aslambs. The Prime Minister spoke of inviting the Germans to appoint representatives on this International Tribunal. I think, to invite the Germans, or to sit with theGermans, who helped to make a scape-goat of the ex-Kaiser, whom they at one timeworshipped and supported, would be degrading for us. Of course, there is always the danger that the ex-Kaiser might go back. M.j first point is that the mind of theGerman people has not really changed by the ex-Kaiser&apos;s inglorious and undignifiedexit. Let us beware that we do not create a Hohenzollern legend like the Napoleoniclegend. Here is King Charles&apos;s statue which stands at the end of Whitehall to-day. Ihave nothing against that except for the fact that it leaves people to this day foolishlydecorating it.   The Napoleonic legend grew with St. Helena.Lord Curzon: Do remember that Napoleon all the way through had the supportof one very powerful party in this country and elsewhere, but as far as I know theEmperor William stands alone in the universal execration of mankind. The PrimeMinister, in his remarks, said he thought there would be no difficulty in getting the ex-Kaiser given up by Holland. I wonder if that is the case ? I should have thought there would have been many difficulties ?Mr. Balfour : I imagine the difficulties would be prodigious.Sir Robert Borden : We might consider what has been the influence of the ex-Kaiseron the German people in the past and what it might be in the future if we proceedagainst him. As Mr. Chamberlain said, he has made an inglorious exit, he is in ahumiliating position, and he has not much influence in Germany to-day.Mr. Montagu: One important point would be to see that the tribunal was properlycomposed. The majority of the neutrals are people who are either afraid of germany or else sympathise with Germany. &apos; .-The Prime Minister : It would include jurists from all the Allied countries.Lord Reading: I should not go too far in the direction of jurists.Mr. Chamberlain: You must say about this^what President Roosevelt said of the seizure of the Panama Canal:   &quot; Let there be no taint of legality about it.&quot;The Prime Minister: I am entirely with Lord Curzon on this matter. I think this man ought to be tried for high treason against humanity. That is my view, andI regret to see there is hesitation upon that subject. I think it is a cardinal mistake.There is no legend you can create about a creature of this kind. Napoleon fought; hewas actually under fire; and he showed great talent and power which won theadmiration of the world, but the ex-Kaiser is a poor wretched thing who never showed,any strength of character or any brilliancy of mind, and I do not believe anythingcould create a legend for him or for that poor miserable creature of a son.Mr. Chamberlain: He was a legend in Germany, but he may have fallen.[543-9] D
The Prime Minister : A great many legends have been destroyed by this war,and the ex-Kaiser is one. He posed really as a fine courageous fellow ; he has shownhimself a poor miserable coward who ran away at the first sight of difficulties.Napoleon III, at any rate, faced the fire with his men and was eventually captured,but nothing can create a legend for the ex-Kaiser. Charles I was at the back of hismen in battle ; he showed some qualities which deserve some respect, but there is nothing in this man that merits anything of the kind. If it is the view of theImperial Cabinet that we should not agree with M. Clemenceau on this subject, very well, I accept it, but I accept it under strong protest.Lord Gurzon : I think we ought to await the Report of the Committee which islooking into the matter from the legal point of view.Mr. Hughes : What people outside think is that he has committed treason againsthumanity, but unfortunately that is not a crime at all, otherwise the world would havebeen very different from what it is to-day. What I suggest as a course of practical politics is this, that you should make a public declaration of policy that all those personswho have committed crimes against international law, persons of the type who were responsible for the death of Captain Fryatt, the sinking of the &quot; Lusitania,&quot; and anythingof that kind, whether they were Generals or Admirals or Kaiser or peasant, whoeverthey were, should be brought to justice.The Prime Minister : That is letting off the greatest criminal of the lot. If whatthe Minister of Munitions says about the man who is the root of the whole trouble,and who deliberately made war, is right, that he could shift the responsibility on tosomeone else, and show that he did his best to prevent it, then that is his case, and lethim make it, and on it he ought to stand his punishment. The German people havestood their punishment.Mr. Hxighes : I think that 85 per cent, of the German people are as bad as theex-Kaiser ever was, and are as deserving of death ; but I am not in favour of this85 per cent, getting off free and sheltering under the blood of this man.The Prime Minister : They have not got off&quot;free ; they have incurred about 5,000,000or 6,000,000 casualties and they have starved for four or five years, but neither theex-Kaiser nor his household have suffered any privations or anything else.&apos; Mr. Long : And he has taken his millions with him.Lord Gurzon: Ought we not to await the Attorney-General&apos;s report to see, firstly,from the point of view of the law, what kind of tribunal it would be possible to setup, and secondly, the point, semi-legal and semi-diplomatic, can we get hold of thisman ? The Foreign Secretary said he thought there would be great difficulty in gettinghim given up. Thirdly, the matter cannot really be decided here ; we must discuss it with our Allies. -; The Prime Minister: The question here is not whether we should try him ; thequestion is whether whoever meets M. Clemenceau, is going to say the BritishGovernment aoree, or, as I understand, the British Government do not agree.Mr. Bonar Law : Of course, this sort of thing would appeal to the public mindtremendously, and it seems to me that M. Clemenceau wants to get the credit of that,but does not want to take the responsibility.Lord Reading : We should first of all examine the question to see what chance ofsuccess we have. Before we commit ourselves to anything we should have some case toput before you, when probably you may be able to see a way of getting over the legaldifficulty. You ought at least to know what is the precise charge and how far it isfeasible to proceed, the procedure to be adopted, and what means there are of getting the ex-Kaiser handed over to stand the trial.The Prime Minister: So long as the reference includes the real crime of theex-Kaiser I am perfectly willing it should go to the Law Officers.Sir Robert Borden: Until we get their report the question might stand for further-consideration.Mr. Chamberlain: The Law Officers might not- only consider the charge to be framed against the ex-Kaiser but also the defence which would be likely to be put upby him.   His defence might be our trial.
The Prime Minister : Unless I have confidence in our case I would not proceed.I never knew there was anybody here who doubted that we could go before any decenttribunal with a clear conscience.Mr. Chamberlain : My only doubt is the possibility of securing a good tribunal.If you have a tribunal which includes neutrals, then, as the Secretary of State forIndia points out, you will be up against the danger that these neutrals have eitherbeen neutrals because they sympathise with Germany or because they were afraid ofGermany. -Mr. Churchill: There is the case between Germany and Russia; Russia has beengiven very many hundreds of millions by the French to complete strategic railways, andif Russia was in the hands of a couple of women they might persuade her either thisway or that. There is a great deal to be said about Russia in this matter, if youunfolded the question.The Prime Minister : I have heard all this said by pacifists, but I never knewanyone here was against it.Sir Robert Borden: It might assist us in coming to a conclusion if we consider what would probably have happened if Emperor William had followed the course-of Napoleon and surrendered himself to the British forces.   What would you havedone then ?The Prime Minister: I know what I should suggest he should be put on histrial; he and his son, as the two persons primarily responsible for this great war andfor all the suffering which it has entailed.Mr. Balfour: Your second observation shows some of the difficulties in our way.Personally I dislike the Crown Prince more than the Kaiser; I think he is the greaterbrute. I think that whatever good qualities the Kaiser may possess are wanting inhis son, but you cannot make out that the son is any more than a subordinate of hisfather. He had the influence, no doubt, which the heir to a throne so often has, but you cannot drag him before a Court of Law because his father went to war.The Prime Minister: The Crown Prince took a systematically organised part in stimulating the action of the ex-Kaiser and of Germany, and there is abundantevidence about it.   He is perfectly responsible.Mr. Balfour : If you are beginning propaganda-The Prime Minister: No, certainly not propaganda. There is no doubt whateverthat he forced his fathers hand very largely upon this subject.Mr. Hughes : It would be a very serious thing if this man were brought up for trial and not convicted.The Prime Minister: All those who have no confidence in our case are right invoting against it, but, as I say, I have complete confidence in the Allied case, and wouldlike to see it put forward before the strongest body of jurists. Sir Maurice Hankey hasdrafted something which perhaps he will read :  /&quot; As a preliminary to the possible discussion of the question with our Allies,the Imperial War Cabinet decided to invite the Law Officers of the Crown toexamine the question from a juridical point of view, including the possibility ofconstituting a Court, for the trial of, and framing charges against, the ex-emperor of Germany and the ex-Crown Prince, as well as to consider the possible line ofdefence that the accused might adopt.&quot;The Prime Minister: My objection to the first part is that it presupposes you will only try him on what would be legal charges.Lord Reading : It is not sufficiently wide.Mr. Hughes : Is that confined to the ex-Kaiser only ?Mr. Balfour: I must put in a plea for Talaat and Enver, who certainly ought tobe hanged.The Prime Minister: That can be brought forward at the next Imperial WarCabinet meeting.
2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,&quot; November 20, 1918.0(Lord Reading then, read the following conclusions on this subject, which were-approved by the Imperial War Cabinet): (a.) To invite the Law Officers of the Crown to examine, from the widest point ofview, the question of framing charges against the ex-Emperor of Germanyand/or the ex-Crown Prince (i.) For the crime against humanity of having caused the war ;and(ii.) For offences, by one or both, against international law during thewar;with a view to bringing home to one or both the fresponsibility for theacts charged;(b.) To invite the Law Officers of the Crown, to consider the constitution of a tribunal to try the charges framed ;(c.) To invite the Law Officers to examine with the Foreign Office the practi-ability of inducing the Dutch Government to hand over the ex-Emperorand the Crown Prince to such a tribunal for trial.Mr. Hughes: When is the probable date of the Inter-Allied Conference.The Prime Minister&apos;: The 14th or 15th of December.
