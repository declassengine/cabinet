THE PRIME MINISTER : Perhaps the Foreign Secretary will now let us havehis statement on War Aims.MR. BALFOUR : Well, Mr. Prime Minister, it is a tremendous subject, and I donot see how it can be treated very rapidly. Of course, it falls geographically intofour different sets of interconnected questions. There are the Western questions,connected with France and Alsace-Lorraine ; Italy and Italian aspirations ; then thereare the most complicated of all, the great Central European problems, which nowextend, since the Brest-Litovsk Treaty and the developments which have followed upon that, froth the Arctic Ocean down the east cOast of the Baltic to the Black Sea and tothe iEgean and the Mediterranean. Those are the most involved, and perhaps someof the most important, certainly the most embarrassing, questions which will have tobe dealt with. Then there is a whole group of Eastern questions, centring roundPalestine and Mesopotamia; and then finally the question of the German colonies,which&apos; is hot the easiest, perhaps, to settle, but certainly the simplest of all.As regards the first group, the Western group, there is very little to safcy. In thecase of France we are not bound by treaty to add anything to French territory, butwe are bound by our declarations to France to secure for her Alsace-Lorraine. Itdoes not rest with us, in my opinion, to modify that policy. If the Allies are com-pletely successful it will not require modification. If the success of the Allies isqualified, it is possible that qualification may be necessary, but any suggestion of compromise on the subject of Alsace-Lorraine, if it is to take place at all, must comefrom the French and. not from us. I therefore pat that on one side with this furtherobservation, that a certain number of hints and suggestions which have come to us from various sources imply that certain Germans that section of Germany which is most desirous of having ah arrangement that we could regard as satisfactory would apparently be prepared to compromise, and to give France a great deal as regardsterritory, but to retain the control over the mineral resources of Alsace-Lorraine, whichhave turned out to be of extraordinary importance since they were handed over by france to Germany in 1871. That transfer has had economic results which no humanbeing at ike time foresaw, and which, I think, will add a great deal to the difficulty incoming io ah arrangement with Germany about that district.As regards Italy, we are bound, unlike the case of France, by treaty. In 1915,Mr. Asquith^s Government were determined and quite rightly to bring Italy, if itwere possible, into the war, and in order to bring her into the war they.no doubt gave&apos;terms to Italy which cannot be justified on ethnological grounds, and which, I believe,would embarrass Italy itself if they were carried out in their completeness. But theTreaty is there, and we are clearly bound by its provisions, and any modification of itmust be an Italian suggestion-at least, so it seems to me. There has been quite a distinct change in Italian opinion since April 1915.MR. HUGHES : Have the terms of that Treaty been made public ?THE PRIME MINISTER : The Bolshevists published it..   MR. BALFOUR: But we have never admitted it.MR. BONAR LAW : The publication was not quite accurate.MR. HUGHES : t should like to have a copy.THE PRIME MINISTER : I think copies were circulated last year.SIR MAURICE HANKEY : Copies were circulated last year, and a copy was sent to Australia.MR. BALFOUR: Circulated confidentially, of course.THE PRIME MINISTER : I think you had a copy last year, Mr. Hughes.MR. BALFOUR : There has heed a change in Italian public opinion undoubtedlysince 1915. The great defender of the 1915 Treaty in its entirety,&apos; without modifica-tion or variation of a comma, is Baron Sonnino, and Baron Sonnino is no doubt rather a difficulty to us at this moment. We have to remember, in the first place, that he is aman of very high character, resolute courage, and absolute disinterestedness ; and inthe second place, that he was really, I believe, the man who brought Italy into the warmore than anybody else.. Sir Rennell Roddis here, and he knows Baron Sonnino much better than I do, and I have no doubt he will give you his impression, which will be worth much more than mine, of the Italian position after I have done, but to put it
oo&quot;briefly, I should say that Baron Sonnino has only slightly changed his attitude since1915, but that the Prime Minister (Signor Orlando) and Signor Nitti are quite prepared to consider any change in the Treaty of 1915, provided that Treaty, whencarried out, really did give Italy what Italy has an ethnological claim to, and gave herreasonable frontier securities. I really think that this is all I need say about theWestern or Italian-Franco part of this tremendous problem.SIR ROBERT BORDEN : Is Baron Sonnino one of the representatives of Italyat the Versailles Conference &apos;?MR, BALFOUR : He is in my position, that is to say, the Prime Ministers usuallyask their Foreign Secretaries to&apos; go with them, but we are not actually members.THE PRIME MINISTER : You are members-the Prime Minister and another member of the Cabinet.MR. BALFOUR : At any rate the differences are rather technical thansubstantial.When you come to the second problem, that of Central Europe, which is by far the most complicated of all, the question which meets you on the threshold, which hasbeen perplexing us&apos;all through this war, and which we can only, perhaps, now say is moreor less finally decided, is the status of Austria the status that Austria ought to occupyif we are successful; in other words, let me put it this way : What ought we to tryfor ? Ought we to tight for the destruction of Austria as a State under theHapsburgs, cutting it up into its constituent ethnological units, or ought we to try tokeep it together in some shape or another under the Hapsburgs with, roughlyspeaking, something like its present frontiers ? One&apos;s first instinct is to say : &quot; Well,Austria has been there for all these centuries.&quot; Someone once said, I forget who itwas, I daresay Sir Rennell Rodd can tell us, &quot; that if Austria did not exist she wouldhave to be created.&quot; She has performed, more or less badly, a certain function in thebalance of European Powers, and if there was the slightest hope that a renovatedAustria, or an Austria at all, would be a counterpoise to Germany in Central Europe,it really would be worth while seeing whether we could not keep her and alter her. Iconfess that the whole trend of events in the last three or four years shows that eitherAustria goes to pieces or that Austria remains a satellite of Germany. She has nowgot, I believe, a military treaty with Germany; she will be forced, I have not the slightest doubt, into an economic treaty, though there will always be diniculties inthat. She is absolutely dependent on Germany if she&apos; is to remain under her present constitution, because nobody can understand the Austrian constitution unless they keepin mind that Axtstria exists as Austria by so manipulating her constitution that aGerman and a Magyar minority can keep the control in Austria and Hungaryrespectively. It is Germany&apos;s interest that that German-Magyar minority should bethe controlling force in the Austrian Empire, and that being so the Emperor of Austriawill always be dependent on Germany for his security and the unity of his dominions.It is therefore impossible to conceive a condition of things under which Austria wouldplay the part which we should like to see her play, namely, that of an independentpowerful counterpoise to the other great Central Power, Germany. Thus consequently the whole movement, almost unconsciously, but quite steadily, has been going ordrifting in the direction of giving autonomy, real independence, if possible, to thePoles in the extreme north of Austria, to the Czecho-Slovaks, also in the north oAustria, and to the Jugo-Slavs in the south of Austria. If that policy were carried outsuccessfully and to its full logical conclusion, the only chain that would remain of theHapsburg Empire would be the Magyar portion of Hungary and the German portionof Austria, and it is extremely doubtful it is, perhaps, more than doubtful whethera State so constituted could hang together, whether there would be in it any elements of stability. I am disposed to think and all those whom I have consulted would, Ithink, take this view that, if that state of things were reached, the German-A.ustrianswould insist on joining the German Empire, and the Magyars would form one of thelarge number of independent States which seem likely to emerge from the presentchaos in Eastern Europe. You may say : &quot; Would it not be a great disaster that theGerman element in Austria should join the German Empire? Would it not addstrength to the homogeneous element of the German Empire, which would make ii&apos;even more formidable than it will be after even the best peace is secured which wecan hope for ? &quot; On the whole, 1 am not sure that it is so very important. Thenumber of Germans is not so very great. I think it is roughly 11,000,000, but those11,000,000 would not all be in the German part of Austria ; many of them are
scattered about over parts of the Austrian Empire, and I should myself doubt whetherGermany would get any very important addition. Then, remember, if it does get an addition, important or unimportant, whichever it is, it would be undoubtedly an anti-Prussian and a pro-Bavarian addition. The population is Roman Catholic inreligion like the Bavarians and the Wiirtembergers, which is&apos;-very hostile to thetemperament of North Germany, and I am not sure if the Prussian element inGermany wants these people to be added to the Empire ; I am not sure if they were added to the Empire they would greatly increase the strength of the Germany in thefuture. However that may be on the whole, I venture to suggest that it would be inthe interests of the world that Austria should be broken up into its constituentelements rather than that the population of 51,000,000 or 52,000,000, which is the:Austrian population now, should be bound to its other Central neighbour, forming an immense addition both economically and from the point of view of man-power. Ofcourse I have to admit at once that we have got all sorts of difficult problems beforeus when we try to reconstitute Central Europe on ethnological grounds. Bohemia,for example, as I think I said at the Cabinet the other day, is of all the constituent,States in Austria the one for which 1 am inclined to feel the most respect. TheBohemian element shows a power of uniting, of avoiding the party fissures which make Poland such a difficult problem for its friends, if not for its enemies. the czecho-Slovaks have been prepared to fight for their cause, to be imprisoned for theircause, and to suffer in every sort of way in order to regain their ancient autonomy.Their frontiers, at any rate on the Bohemian side, are very clearly defined.Unfortunately, there is quite an important German strip of territory running along the Bohemian mountains which it is difficult to include in Bohemia and difficult to exclude from Bohemia. It is, perhaps, the worst specimen of the kind of questionwhich meets us all through these ethnological redistributions of territory, namely, thatwhile the nucleus of ci country is fairly homogeneous, there is a disputed fringe wherethe population is evenly divided, and very often the frontiers which nature has markedout are not the frontiers which correspond with the ethnological divisions. I thinkmyself in some cases we shall have have to throw ethnology to the winds, and take awell-defined mountain range or a big river as a boundary where purely ethnologicaldivisions might suggest some modifications of the natural divisions. As regardsthe Jugo-Slavs in the southern part of Austria, 1 do not think there will be much difficulty in that way. I think you could easily make a province which will be practically homogeneous and Jugo-Slav.There are also other difficulties which have to be met. Perhaps among the smallerdifficulties is Montenegro. Montenegro is purely Jugo-Slav ethnologically, linguistic-ally, and religiously.   I think it is Roman Catholic ; Serbia is Orthodox.SIR MAURICE BLANKET: The Austrian provinces of this ideal Jugo-Slavkingdom are, in the main, Roman Catholic.MR. BALFOUR : I think there is, in fact, a not unimportant Mahommedanelement too.LORD ROBERT CECIL : There is a very large one in Bosnia.MR. BALFOUR: Compared with the&apos;whole it is not very great, but it is notunimportant.MR. MASSEY : Bohemia is mostly Roman Catholic.MR. BALFOUR : Yes, Bohemia is all Roman Catholic. Although it was thehome of the Bvussites, it is practically all Roman Catholic now. The Jugo-Slavs arepartly Orthodox and partly Roman Catholic. This Roman Catholic element would, Ibelieve, only a generation ago, have been felt to be an overwhelming difficulty in theway of a union of the whole race, but they tell me I should very much like to know what Sir Rennell Rodd hears in Italy that the situation has greatly altered, andundoubtedly the resolution arrived at at Corfu, in which both parties of the idealkingdom were fully represented, the religious question did not play an important part.The other great difficulty in Austria is not merely, Austrian, but it carries us over from Axistria to Germany. It is the question of Poland. Poland, as everybody knows,is now cut xip into three fragments the fragment that belongs to Germany, but whichhas never been Germanised in spite of every effort that the Germans have made, andwhich is very antagonistic to Germany; the Austrian element, which has been much better treated by Austria than German Poland has been treated by Germany, and is
therefore much more amenable to the Hapsburg influences ; and the remaining part,which belongs to, or did belong, to Russia. Poland is a really difficult question&apos;,because you have there no natural frontiers at all.&apos; It is not too much to say that thereare neither north, east, nor west frontiers ; south frontiers, yes, in parts, but there is ribother definite frontier at all. You have a history behind you in which Poland played a great, part in that region of Europe, but a historic Poland which included greatforeign elements the whole of Lithuania, for instance, and part of Little Russia andother districts which the patriotic Pole, at any rate a few years ago, would have liked to see&apos;added to&apos;a new Poland, but which cannot be added to a new&apos; Poland if youconsider either the language question, or, in some cases, the religious&apos; question, or theethnological question, and there will always be a difficulty in getting the Poles, whoare more romantic than reasonable, to cut their frontiers according to the genuineclaims which Poland has upon our sjmrpathies. 1 That is one difficulty. Anotherdifficulty, and perhaps the worst of all, is that the part of Poland which is most Polish,or which is as Polish as any other, is in the grip of Germany, and is regarded byGermany as absolutely vital to German interests.MR. CHAMBERLAIN : You are referring to the greater part of Silesia andPosen ?MR. BALFOUR: Yes. Germany has two reasons for holding on to those pro-vinces like grim death. One is&apos; that- if it-is&apos; &apos;trakeri&apos; away from Germany Berlin-wouldbe quite close to the German frontier ; it would be almost on the German frontier. Ihave not the measurements here, but it is very small. It is not only a small distance,but there is no natural obstacle at all between Berlin and its eastern neighbours. Thatis one objection, but a greater German objection is the economic point. It so happensthat in Silesia and in Posen are the. great eastern coalfields and manufacturing dis-tricts, and there is nothing that Germany would not do to prevent those being restored to their rightful owners, namely, the Poies. A third difficulty with regard to Poland isthe access:to the sea. At Versailles we promised&apos;access to the&apos;sea ; &quot;we were-too wise,too cautious, to promise a bit of coast-line. xOf course, what the historic Poles Wouldlike to have had is Danzig. Danzig is one of the great Hanseatic free cities. Tt has never been, I&apos; suspect, really Polish, becaxise the Poles have never been a commercialpeople, and the Germans have. All the same, Danzig was to all intents and purposes the port&quot; of Poland dependent on &quot;Poland, and it is surrounded by&apos;territory which ispurely Polish, or Polish&apos; to the greatest extent. - But I. do not think that we-! could contemplate really giving Danzig to Poland. It is almost impossible. If you did ityou would cut off the eastern provinces of Prussia from the western provinces ofPrussia ; in other words, you would give Poland an access to the sea, a fragment of thecoast-line, by cutting Prussia in two. Well, E do not think that is within the reach of practical politics, or it is very difficult to conceive its being so. Therefore, I think the promise of access to the sea must be a&apos; promise to be fulfilled by making free thenavigation of the Vistula.        1 :- .   &apos;&apos;LORD CURZON : It is not a treaty obligation, is it? Are you speaking of thelast Versailles Conference?*&apos;*&apos;** -       U1XMR. BALFOUR : Yes, there was nothing before that.LORD CURZON : I am speaking about access to the sea ; was there anv promisemade before ?   &quot; &quot; &apos;-&apos; - 1 :&quot;   i!1 &quot; 1&apos;&quot;f&apos; &apos; &apos;        &apos;&quot;   J&quot;*MR. BALFOUR : I rather think there was, but I do not remember all the facts.Poland says &apos; Yoti cannot shut us up and give us no access to the sea, and PresidentWilson, I. think, has committed himself to that.      -   -&apos; 1&apos; THE PRIME MINISTER : I think Colonel House is the man who did it.MR. CHAMBERLAIN : I think President Wilson committed himself to it at thevery beginning&apos;. 1 1 -&apos;MR. BALFOUR : It is a problem which I wish some of us had leisure more carefully to look into.

hand, and which ought to he done quickly, or somebody ought to make suggestionsquickly. If that were done it would immensely simplify the reconstruction of europe on an ethnological basis.SIR ROBERT BORDEN : Something like we have in Canada.MR. HUGHES : It leads iip to the freedom of the seas.MR. BALFOUR : That is a very big question. I am not sure in what sense youare using the term &quot; Freedom of the seas,&quot;MR. HUGHES : In the worst sense.THE PRIME MINISTER : You mean the German sense ?MR. HUGHES : Yes. The navigation of a river differs from the navigation ofthe sea.MR. BALFOUR : The river is territorial property, and what you would do by the sort of treaty I contemplate is what has been done by Germany on the Rhine.MR. HUGHES : The argument is stronger, but there it is.MR. BALFOUR : That we shall have to fight about.SIR ROBERT BORDEN : We have both rivers and railways between canada and the United States you know.MR. BALFOUR : That is a good analogy.,SIR ROBERT BORDEN : We navigate the St. Lawrence and run our railwaysinto the United States and they run their railways to the Western part of Ontario.MR. BONAR LAW: That is during peace ; if you were at war it would be different.SIR ROBERT BORDEN .: I am speaking of the problem with regard to accessby interior States.MR. BALFOUR : I now have the exact decision arrived at Versailles in regard to poland, to which I have just referred, and which reads as follows:  &quot; The creation of a united and independent Polish State with free access to- the sea, constitutes one of the conditions of a solid and just peace, and of the rule of right in Europe.&quot;I think that is sound, but we have to remember that whatever we do we shall get into difficulties over Poland. I believe the best course would be to follow theethnological divisions of the Eastern frontier, to make arrangements with regard tothe navigation of the Vistula, which Avould give Poland access to the Baltic, and tomake no plans for the Western or German frontier of Poland until we know how muchwe are going to beat Germany.I now go from the question of Poland to the question of those States that wereRussian before the Russian collapse, and this brings us to a set of problems which ofcourse none of us ever contemplated when the war broke out, and which have reallybeen forced upon our attention, you may say, in the last few months, since the Brest-Litovsk Treaty. As soon as Russia went into dissolution I confess I did not foresee it-she suddenly showed signs of divisions which everybody knew existed as historical facts,but which I did not think would show themselves immediately and strongly in the way they have done. Of course it has partly been encouraged by German intrigue, and thelargest of all the areas which shows a desire to break off from Ptussia, and. which, least of all, ought to break off on ethnological, linguistic, or religious grounds, is the Ukraine.I have no doubt that German and Austrian intrigue had a great deal to do with that. Asa consequence of that we have now to consider the following new States the Ukraine,Lithuania, Lettland, Esthonia, and Finland. They all belonged to the RussianEmpire, although the Ukraine alone is substantially Russian, both in raceand in religion. As regards religion the Lithuanians are in the main roman catholic. The Letts, the Esthonians, and the Finns are in the main Protestant,but in race they differ both from the Russians, from the Poles, from theGermans, and from each other. Germany&apos;s behaviour here has been extremelycynical and ingenious, but I think it has been so ingenious that it is going ultimately to defeat itself.   Germany has quite deliberately refused to consider the ethnological
divisions in breaking up these districts.   What she wants to do, and has succeeded in doing, is to carve out a series of areas which will make each of these States hostile to each other State, and which will make the internal Government of each of these Statesdependent upon her.   The result is that she will be the controlling influence what-ever happens as long as these divisions are allowed to last.. You might put it thisway : That she has arranged a chain of border States, part of whose business is to watch one another ; she has deprived Georgia of Baku, and by doing that Georgiawill always be an enemy of Turkey.   She instigates Turkey to claim rectification ofthe frontier with Bulgaria, so that Turkey will always be the enemy of Bulgaria ; she has refused the Bulgarians the whole of the Dobrudja, therefore Bulgaria and Roumaniawill always quarrel; she has given Bessarabia to Roumania so that Roumania and theUkraine will always quarrel; by giving the Oholm districts of Poland to the Ukraine,Ukraine and Poland will always quarrel; and by giving part of Russian territory to finland, Finland and Russia must remain enemies.   By her action in each of thesecountries she rules through the minority who must look to her for protection ; it maybe the big Polish landowners in one place ; the big German landowners in anotherplace ; it may be the Poles here, or the Little Russians there ; but she always contrivesto make the Government of the country dependent upon her, and what she proposesto do and is doing is not to incorporate these countries in her Empire that would beto make them far less useful to her and far more embarrassing to her policy than theyare at present she proposes to make them dependent upon her in the way I have just  described, and  not  only this,  but in  addition, to  bind  them  to her bytreaties  which will make them economically dependent, economically subservient,and by military conventions will  put  their man-power, in  case of  need,  verymuch at her disposal.    She may put German princes at the head of them, but whether she does that and has therefore a sort of personal union with the german empire or not, she will not admit them into her system, because that would do two things : it would, in the first place, give them all the fiscal advantages of the Germansystem, and they would be economic elements with full rights within the german empire ; and in the second place, they would have the right to send representatives to the Reichstag, and there would be a minority in addition to the Polish minority, andthe Danish minority, and the French minority, under which the Reichstag alreadysuffer.   You would have a Lett minority, the Polish minority would be enormouslyincreased, and so forth.   So what Germany wants to do is not to incorporate these states in the German Empire, but to put them in a position much more useful to her,namely, to make them slaves economically and contributors of men from a militarystandpoint.   Lord Curzon the other day gave an admirable account to the imperial war Cabinet of the dangers to India which might ensue from German and Turkishdomination in Central Asia.   I do not believe there will be German domination in central Asia if we can break down the Brest-Litovsk Treaty.   It is a very long wayafter all to get there across the Black Sea, and across the Caucasian region, and thenacross the Caspian, and I do not believe the peril is very great if you break down thissystem that the Germans are putting up ; but if you leave the Germans controlling allthe border States in the manner I have described, and having in addition to thatprobably a subservient Russian Empire, with a Czar dependent ultimately, against hisown revolutionaries upon German influences, then I think the peril of Central Asiamay be considerable.   Therefore, to my mind the most important thing to doj so far asthe East is concerned, is to smash up the whole arrangement which Germany has arrived at by the Brest-Litovsk Treaty, to destroy her prestige in those countries, tomake instead of the States which she has created States which are either really inde-pendent, or which are joined to Russia as free autonomous communities in some kindof federal union.   In any case, I think we shall have to make arrangements by which russia will have some communication with the external world by the West, because ifyou keep the geography in mind, you will see that if there is a series of States fromthe north of Finland down to the Black Sea, all under German domination, none ofthem connected with Russia, Russia is entirely cut off, and you cannot get at it anyhow.Those are the problems of Northern Central Europe.Then you come to what has been the perplexity of statesmen certainly ever since1875 the Balkan question. Ever since Turkey has been expelled, the problem ofthe relations between the Balkan States has kept us on the edge of war year afteryear. All Europe has been tormented with these problems, which sometimes seem tobe absolutely insoluble. The great difficulty there is Bulgaria, and the feelings withwhich Bulgaria is regarded by her Serbian and her Greek neighbours. The Bulgarianshave behaved quite abominably.   I do not know how much of the stories I hear is to
 be believed, but I am told that the atrocities that the Bulgarians have committed upon the Roumanians; upon the Serbians, and upon the Greeks in the districts where Roumanians, Serbians, and Greek populations have been overrun by Bulgarian troops, are past the limits of horror. Bulgaria is also credited by her neighbours with being insatiable, that is to say, they regard her as a Balkan Prussia, with the German idea Of domination ingrained in her mentality, and therefore with a subtle determination to be the leading Power in the Balkans for the present and ultimately--if her full ambitions are satisfied--succeeding to the Empire of Alexander the Great. I do not know what limits some of these politicians put upon Bulgarian ambitions. I do not think those remote dangers should perturb us, but the immediate difficulty is really very great, and it is very great for this reason: the Serbians and the Greeks are our Allies; the Serbians have suffered immensely, almost beyond belief, during the war. We owe them a great deal. They have fought with great gallantry, and though they have got their obvious national defects I think on the whole they are worthy of very high respect. The Greeks under their King pursued a very tortuous course, but under Venizelos they have behaved on the whole extremely well, and we owe a great debt to Venizelos, a debt which is very difficult to overestimate. But if you suggest to  Venizelos, for example, that some of the territory which the Bulgarians now occupy is really Bulgarian, and therefore in a settlement should be handed back to Bulgaria or left to Bulgaria, he would say to you : You absolutely ruin me, and you ruin my party, because the Emperor of Germany did promise King Constantine that the limits of Greece should; if Greece behaved well, be respected. Now you propose that I should go out of the war after fighting, and after all the cost in men and money, with smaller territory than Greece could have had without fighting." That, he would tell you, is absolute ruin to the cause of Venizelos, to the cause of Greek liberalism, and to the cause of Greece remaining on the side of the Allies. Of course this verbal promise which he quotes was not a solemn treaty; it was a promise made, so far as I can understand the matter; by the Emperor William to his brother-in-law Tino; but still, there it is; it appears, whether it is true or not, whether it would have been kept or not to be universally considered by Greece to have been binding, and I think, therefore, Venizelos is right in saying that: "Whatever happens the Bulgarians must not get part of my Greek territory, which they never would have got if we had not joined the Entente." Moreover, the jealousy and suspicion of Bulgaria are so great that you can hardly talk to a Serbian or Greek about coming to terms with Bulgaria. They at once think they are going to be betrayed; then you see their bristles go out, and you have the utmost difficulty in making them believe that you do not mean to throw them over in order to get peace with Bulgaria. On the other hand; if you get peace with Bulgaria, if Bulgaria really did change sides, it would have an overwhelming effect upon the results of the war. It therefore requires the most careful steering, the most cautious diplomacy you can imagine, and, I think, the best way of dealing with it--at least the best way which suggests itself to me--is to say privately to Venizelos and the leading Serbian statesmen : "Now, here is a difficulty. What is your solution?" and get them to speak. Ultimately I think we shall have to force a solution, upon them, and a just solution. I think the time will come, or may come, when we shall have to say  to them that something must be settled, and we shall have to make the best solution we can whether they like it or not. These Allies must come out of the war better than they went into it, otherwise they will have a genuine grievance against us. I do not believe that it is possible at this moment to go much further in that subject than I have gone.

 THE PRIME MINISTER: What about the islands ?

 MR. BALFOUR: The islands, I think, ought all to be Greek.

 THE PRIME MINISTER:  There was some difficulty with the Czar over the islands at the entrance of the Dardanelles.

 MR BALFOUR: Yes. Of course Italy is a trouble about the islands. Italy claims some islands down by Rhodes--the Dodecanese. Italy claims them, and I suppose Italy must keep them.

 MR. CHAMBERLAIN: She has been in possession of them since the Turkish war.

 MR. BALFOUR: Yes. There remains, then, only the East Palestine and Mesopotamia, and the colonial question. As regards Palestine and Syria, one of our 


diplomatic difficulties is the arrangement we came to with the French and Italians,known as the Sykes-Picot Agreement, which still subsists as a diplomatic instrument,but which I think is historically out of date. I believe both the French and Italiansknow that it is historically out of date, but I am very unwilling to raise that question with them in any formal way, especially with the Italians, who do not so much wantanything for themselves, as that they do not want France to get anything unless they getsomething equivalent. One of the greatest embarrassments of the British ForeignOffice, as Sir Rennell Rodd knows very well, is the jealousy of the French and theItalians as regards the Eastern Mediterranean and the adjacent territories. It is oneof the strongest motives that moves, at any rate, Baron Sonnino and those who thinkwith him. They are not jealous of Great Britain, but they are bitterly jealous ofFrance, and for any extension of territory and any advantage which is given to france in those regions they insist on having an equivalent for themselves. That greatlyhampers the wheels of negotiation which drive very heavily sometimes over these problems, though they have not much practical substance. Certainly Palestine hassubstance. We are there, we are already doing great things in Palestine. We havedriven out the Turks, and we are giving the natives an adequate water supply ; we areencouraging agriculture ; wealth is increasing by leaps and bounds, and it is quite certain that Palestine can never be restored, or ought never to be restored, to Turkishrule. What ought to happen to Palestine is another question. I believe that the inhabi-tants, whether they be Arabs or Jews, or whoever they be, would, if left to themselves,wish it to be a British Protectorate. I confess for myself I should like to associate the americans in any Protectorate, and I do not know that, if you do that, you can exclude the French and the Italians. I have no doubt we alone could do better than we could in combination with other people, but at the same time, this extension of Egypt to palestine, especially if you are going to have a Protectorate, as I think you must, overMesopotamia-THE PRIME MINISTER : I have no doubt you have thought about it, but haveyou formed an opinion as to the desirability of America taking charge of Palestinealtogether ? There is a good deal to be said from the point of view of indticing her todo so, and it ought not to be difficult when you come to deal with the colonies. Thesecond point is, you there interpose the whole power of America between Egypt andanything that might come from the north.MR. BALFOUR: Individually I expect there is no great difference of opinion between us. I should have no jealousy of America taking that job over, but I do notthink she would be anxious to do it ; she would regard it as a bribe.THE PRIME MINISTER : I think the American public would be pleased;President Wilson would probably shrink from it a little.MR. HUGHES : It is probable that the American public know where Palestine is ;beyond that I do not think they know much about it.MR. BALFOUR : I agree.THE PRIME MINISTER : They will get more imperialistic as the War goes on.MR, BALFOUR : I think that is worth thinking of.SIR ROBERT BORDEN : I think they know more about Palestine than youimagine.MR-. HUGHES : Yes, because they have learned it all at school.MR. BALFOUR: Whatever is done about Palestine will have to have an inter-national flavour; I do nOt think yott Can avoid that.THE PRIME MINISTER : I am afraid of anything in the nature of a condominium.MR. BALFOUR: The Mesopotamian question is again perplexing. I rememberquite well that, in my own opinion, at the very beginning of the war it was a greatmisfortune that we had to go there, because I pictured to myself a British area under british rule open to attack from any military empire, Russian or Turkish, or whatever it might be, from the north, and we should have great difficulty in defending that.But all that state Of things has gone ; there is no great Russian Empire in the northwhich is coming down through the mountains of the Caucasus to the Persian Gulf, andthe difficulties now are of a different kind. We are pledged to hand it over to the[543-6] D
Arab State, in other words, not to annex it, but I think it is clear that in some formor another we must be the guiding spirit there. However, whether you call it aBritish Protectorate, or whatever name you give it, I do not see how we can avoid theresponsibility of, at all events, guiding it in its earlier years. Wonders are being done, I believe. It is going to feed itself, to pay for itself even in time of war amost amazing performance-and to hand all that back to Arab misrule, and ultimately to Turkish reconquest, or to the Germans, seems to me to be quite impossible.Then another question which has recently cropped up, and with which theCabinet is acquainted, is that arising out of the oil problem. I do not know whetherthe Admiralty paper was circulated to all the Imperial War Cabinet. I am told that it was, so you know all about it. In addition to the oil regions, which we alreadylease from Persia, apparently in Mesopotamia there is a geological extension of thatfield which makes it almost the most important oilfield in the world so it is alleged.Oil to us is becoming a vital national necessity, if only because we are the greatmaritime Power. We do not produce enough oil for ourselves ; in fact, we can scarcelybe said to be an oil-producing empire at all, and our main resources must be from this region, and how we are to deal with that situation when the Peace Conference comesround I am not very clear. With every desire not to acquire more territory than wecan help out of this war in that I believe I differ from some of my colleagues ; I am anxious to keep down the extension of the British Empire as much as possible I amvery reluctant to see anything done which would endanger our obtaining oil from this region. I do not care under what system we keep the oil, whether it is by a perpetuallease or whatever it may be, but I am quite clear that it is all-important for us thatthis oil should be available.MR. HUGHES : Is it considerable in Mesopotamia ?MR. BALFOUR : I am told it is the biggest in the world. If you take the Persianpart which we have got you will see it on this map the Mesopotamian oilfield isa problem which must be faced, and faced quite seriously, when the peace . question has to be settled.LORD CURZON : If we lose control of the oilfields at Baku I believe these arethe only remaining important ones.MR. BALFOUR : I believe these are much better than those at Baku.[The Members then consulted a map showing the Mesopotamian oilfields.)THE PRIME MINISTER : I am in favour of going up as far as Mosul before thewar is over.MR. BALFOUR: Well, Prime Minister, I think I have practically finished.I have circulated a paper which gives my personal views about the German colonies which can be stated in a few words. I am personally very opposed to giving back tothe Germans under any pretence anything in the nature of a maritime base, or any area in which they can levy black troops. Unless Germany alters her whole character,unless really there is a new heaven and a new earth, I am sure that to do so would put us in the power of Germany. That is my first proposition-that no colonies should be handed back to Germany. My second proposition is that Australia, New Zealand, andSouth Africa should obtain the colonies which are adjacent to them the colonies southof the Equator in the Pacific and German West Africa. There remain, of course, the islands in the North Pacific ; those we promised to help Japan to get in exchange for japan sending us naval assistance which has proved very valuable in the Mediterranean.The Dominions were consulted about that, and agreed. There remain now practicallyonly the African colonies.   I do not know how they should be treated.MR. HUGHES : I should like to understand exactly what the position is withregard to that promise.   What is it ?   Is it anything more than a mere conversation ?MR. BONAR LAW : No, it is more than that. It was done in the early days before I was at the Colonial Office, and it was done with the approval--THE PRIME MINISTER : It was done by Lord Grey.MR. HUGHES : Was it done before I came to England in 1916 ?MR. BONAR LAW : I found it an accomplished fact before I went to the ColonialOffice.
MR. HUGHES : We were never informed of that, you know.   It was not before I&apos; came to England.   I saw the Ambassador with you and Sir Edward Grey as he thenwas.MR. BONAR LAW : I remember that conversation with you, Mr. Hughes wewere going over old ground.THE PRIME MINISTER: It was done right at the beginning of the war.MR. BALFOUR : There was something more done. We said that we would help them at a Conference, that was, when the question arose as to whether theywould come in and send naval assistance.MR. HUGHES : I am certain of this. I have been in office from the beginningof the war, and I am certain the Commonwealth Government were not consulted ; theymay have been notified.MR. BONAR LAW : My recollection is this : That when I went to the ColonialOffice I found you had been at all events informed, and I think had approved of it.When you were over here we were trying to get some assistance from the Japanese,and we went into it again, and you quite definitely agreed to it.LORD CURZON : It was done in the time of the present Government. Iremember arguing it at this table. You submitted a paper drawn up by the ForeignOffice by Mr. Nicholson or . somebody I do not know whom. It dealt withShantung in the first place, and with the islands north of the Pacific in the second place, and. the matter was formally discussed here, and the Cabinet decided, upon youradvice, to make this arrangement with Japan that we would support her claims to the islands north of the Equator.MR. HUGHES: I must look up the cable, but I am pretty sure we neverassented to that as a Government.LORD ROBERT CECIL : I will have a memorandum prepared on the subject.MR. BONAR LAW : The record of this is in the Colonial Office.LORD ROBERT CECIL : There were two negotiations, one in 1916 and one in 1917.MR. BONAR LAW : We will get the history out.MR. BALFOUR: There remains, of course, the question on which severalopinions have been put forward by members of the War Cabinet. Lord Curzon haswritten a Paper, Mr. Walter Long has written a Paper, General Smuts has written a paper, and I have written a Paper, none of them quite agreeing with each other as tothe proper method of dealing with the German colonies. I see the objections, ofcourse, to every plan that has been started. All I plead for is this : Do not return thecolonies to Germany, and, if you can, avoid coming out of this war as a Power whichhas gone into it with every profession quite genuine professions too of disinterestedaction, with an increased territory compared to which everybody else&apos;s increase of territory sinks into insignificance.THE PRIME MINISTER : That seems to have always been our fate.   .MR. BONAR LAW : Of course, the French have tremendous increases in africa.SIR ROBERT BORDEN : I entirely agree with Mr. Balfour as to territorialaggrandisement, except so far as it may be absolutely necessary in order to ensure theEmpire&apos;s security. I fully appreciate all that has been said against giving back theGerman colonies, and I am willing to support any measure to prevent Germany fromconsummating any attempt to dominate the world or overthrow the British Empire.But a very bad impression will be created in Canada if we do come out of this warwith great increase of territory. The people of Canada are not prepared to fight,and will not fight, for any territorial extension of the British Empire, which we regard as already unwieldly. There are before us proposals for new frontiers and protectorates to guard us against attack in the future; we speak of establishingcolonies here and colonies there. All this is supposed to be based upon the idea of preventing Germany from carrying out successfully any attempt to assassinate theworld ; but I think we shall have to walk very warily. I go beyond what Mr. Balfourhas said in regard to the United States. If our Empire is to continue as a world-wideCommonwealth of Nations, it must rely not only upon its self-governing DominionSj
but upon the co-operation and support of the United States of &quot;America, with whomthe closest and most intimate relations should be maintained. Without the UnitedStates and without some of our Allies in this... war our situation in the presentstruggle might have been very unfortunate. The more we can induce the UnitedStates to undertake its just responsibilities in world affairs, the better it will be for theworld and the better also for the British Empire. I put the future welfare and peace of the world first, but I think this purpose is equally essential for the security of ourhuge and scattered Empire which we believe to be perhaps the greatest influence forthe welfare of humanity and the advancement of civilisation that has yet been established.Lord Reading can speak with more authority on this than I can, but I know something of the spirit of the United States through our own relations with their people. It hasbeen the traditional policy of the United States to keep aloof from Europeancomplications, and for that matter free from complications elsewhere throughout theworld. It is true that in the Spanish War they acquired interests in the Pacific whichare very important to them, and which, I should imagine, are very much in our inteiestas well.MR. MASSEY : And the Philippine Islands too.SIR ROBERT BORDEN : I think it is becoming increasingly apparent to thepeople of the United States, as indeed to the people of all the Dominions of theEmpire, that no nation can possibly keep itself isolated from the activities of theworld, whether in peace or in war. Speaking before the Bar Association at new york about two years ago, I ventured to liken the present international situation to thesystem which prevailed in some of the Western States of the American Union before there was any regularly organised enforcement of law. People were robbed,plundered, murdered. At first everyone stood to one side and was neutral.Lawlessness and ruffianism were rampant. Then the respectable elements of thecommunity gathered themselves together and without any sanction of law establishedcertain tribunals which dealt with these ruffians and hanged them without muchconsideration. This action of the decent elements in maintaining order by force was thoroughly justified. Perhaps we are emerging by a like development frominternational lawlessness to international order. The first stage may witness lawabiding and honourable nations banding themselves together to prevent internationalrobbery and murder, instead of standing aside as neutrals. In the first instance andwithout any formal league the peace and order of the world may be thus measurablyassured. The more we can get the United States to realise her great responsibilities for the peace and welfare of the world the better it will be for us and for all mankind.For my part, so far as any of the German colonies are concerned, 1 should be ready tohave them pass under the protectorate, or for that matter under the direct control andownership of the United States. I firmly believe that the world, including the BritishEmpire, would be better off by that assumption of responsibility on the part of theUnited States.   I hope that when negotiations-MR; HUGHES : You are referring to the colonies in general ?SIR ROBERT BORDEN: I am not particularising. You, Mr. Hughes, canspeak with more authority than I respecting the islands in the Pacific with whichAustralia is immediately concerned, but which are not of immediate concern to us ; to whatever you urge with regard to them I am willing to give weight. I am speakingof the situation generally. We may say here that this would place the United states in too strong a position; that we would thus endow her with natural resources whichwill make her too formidable an opponent to us. I do not agree with that view; Iam confident that if we can induce the United States to assume internationalresponsibilities in reasonable measure for the protection and development of backwardraces, it will be better for Us, better for the United States, and better for the whole world. If we cannot maintain cordial relations in the future with a nation like theUnited States, composed very largely of the same elements as the white population ofthe British Empire, there is not much hope for the future of the world. Doubtlessthere will always be ri ?alry in commercial matters between us and the United States;yet, taking the broad view, we should not be afraid of strongly urging them all suchresponsibilities as they are willing to undertake. The chief difficulty I think will beto induce them to assume these responsibilities. They will be most reluctant to doso. They are very much influenced by the traditions of more than one hundred years. I for one ain strongly in favour of insisting, as far as permissible, that theyshould take their share with us.MR. HUGHES: Is it intended to discuss this matter to-day or not ?THE PRIME MINISTER: We might go on until a quarter to two, I think.
13148- MR. MASSEY : Is it intended to go back upon the arrangements made last yearupon the report of the different Committees set up to consider this question ? I amthinking specially of the one of which Lord Curzon was chairman, which dealt withthe German colonies and with the islands of the Pacific.THE PRIME MINISTER : Well, that is what we have to discuss. This is reallythe point of Sir Robert Borden&apos;s remarks.MR. BONAR LAW : You were not alluding to the Pacific Islands at all ?SIR ROBERT BORDEN : To the whole question of Africa and the Pacific Islands.I said that I was bound to give weight to the views of Australia and New Zealandbecause they are more immediately concerned. I was stating my own views from the broad standpoint to which I have alluded.MR. BONAR LAW : Would it not be better not to touch the question of theGerman colonies now ? The Ambassadors are here, and according to what Mr. Balfoursaid earlier we might hear the views of Sir Rennell Rodd, and perhaps devote a wholeday, or part of a day, to the question of the colonies. It is rather late in the day to start now.SIR ROBERT BORDEN : I ventured to say what I have said because I may nothave an opportunity of expressing my opinions again.THE PRIME MINISTER: I think it is very important to hear what you have put forward now.MR. HUGHES : I asked yesterday whether you intended to sit this afternoon, andI was told you did not, so I made some engagements.THE PRIME MINISTER : To-morrow afternoon would suit me still better.MR. MASSEY : I think we should have an opportunity of discussing it after what has been said by Sir Robert Borden.THE PRIME MINISTER: Certainly. I think there is a great deal to be said for allowing the Foreign Secretary^ speech and Sir Robert Borden&apos;s very importantsuggestion to sink into our minds before we begin otir discussion, and the Ambassador(Lord Reading) might also like to think it over before he says anything.LORD READING : My view with regard to Palestine is that I think it wouldappeal to the Americans to act as trustees for all the Powers. Of course they have avery large Jewish population, and an important population, and they pay very greatregard to them. I do not know that there is any country in which politically they are more equally treated than in America. There are some social distinctions, but they areimmaterial. Politically they are treated just exactly the same as any other individual asthey would be in this country and in our colonies. But having this large population thereis no doubt they pay a greater attention to them and, above all, the Americans areidealistic speaking of Americans as a whole, and not merely of New York and itwould appeal to them very strongly, I think. They have in mind, and I think we haveto get it into our minds, that America will never stand annexation of territories, in myopinion, so long as President Wilson is at the head of affairs. I do not mean to saythat there is not a section of the population which might take a different view. Ithink it is a minority, and a very small minority, but generally speaking I think you may take it that the American people would not stand for what I may call annexationin the ordinary sense.MR. BARNES : Annexation by America of course.LORD READING: I mean at a Peace Conference. America will never put.forward any claim ; that is quite certain. I am speaking of what you will supportwhen you come to a Peace Conference, and I think it is important that we should bearin mind that they have all along-every single speaker throughout America without exception has announced that this is not a war in which there can be any territoryacquired and so forth. They have gone very, very far ; one has always seen, as you have seen here, that that involves difficvdties when you come to the Peace Conference.At the same time I do think that yoti have to bear in mind that as the war progressesthey will be stronger - against giving back these territories to Germany. I think thatwill be, in my view, much more dominant towards the end of the war than it is at the[543-6] E
present moment. Even now, if you were to poll America, I think you would find alarge majority against returning the colonies to Germany.MR. CHAMBERLAIN : Have they said anything as strong, or at any rate, strongerin that direction this time than they said when they went into the Spanish War ?LORD READING: I cannot say, because I have not the same knowledge of theSpanish War as I have of this War.MR. CHAMBERLAIN : I remember the chaplain in the Senate giving thanks$0 Go.d in the Senate that they were unlike other men, and did not go into thatSpanish-American War to gain territory, but they came put with the Philippines.LORD READING: I am not sure that it is a good precedent.   It was a smallthing compared with the present war ; it was not in the face of the whole world ; theydid not take the same stand then as now, and, moreover, I do not think they are soSpecially pleased with having taken the Philippines. In truth, what I am anxious that weshould bear in mind in any considerations in these matters is that, when we come tothe discussion of what is to be done with Palestine or with the colonies, we alwaysought to try some way short of annexation by the British Empire, and to have it inmind, because you will find difficulties when you come to the point.   A great manyAmericans think that it is better that the colonies should be in the hands of GreatBritain than in those of any other country.   If they were to be handed to anybody,they would prefer Great Britain should have them, but they would not like theiracquisition as part of the British Empire.   It is a point to which I was going tosuggest that some attention shotdd be devoted.   It came up more particularly when mr. Hughes was in America.   If I may say so, he made very powerful arguments tpthe President, which I heard at the time, and afterwards in New York, pointing outhow important it was to Australia that she should have a certain part of the territory which was now occupied^ by Germany more particularly.   There was some comment,not much, the reason&apos; being, I think, that America thought that the moment had notarrived to discuss it, and I am quite sure that the press was warned, as they are there,by the State Department, not to discuss it, otherwise there would have been muchmore general discussion.   I think it had a great value, and I think it made an impression upon them   more particularly, it led them to the view that, in any circumstances, they could not hand this territory back again to Germany as germany was at this nioment.   You have always to bear in mind, I think, further, that if youreally did get a democratic Germany, in the sense in which we and America wouldunderstand the word, it would have been much more difficult to adopt the view whichat present prevails, that is, that nothing can go back to Germany ; but if you have a democratic Germany they would take quite a different view.   Otherwise I think the argument which Mr. Hughes put forward is a very powerful one, and did reallycommend itself to them, although I do not think the President would fall in with theview of Australia taking possession, but I think he would favour the view, as far as Ican judge, of possession being taken of them in such a way that at least there would bea just and fair disposition.   I think he would take that view.   He, of course, wouldnot like them handed back.THE PRIME MINISTER : What view would he take of a proposition of thiskind-Sir Robert Borden&apos;s proposition-supposing you start by saying : &quot; Well, you cannot restore Palestine or Mesopotamia to Turkey-that would be restoring themto people who oppress them and who have devastated these territories.&quot; The same thing applies to the colonies. If you restore these to Germany, Germany willabuse the opportunities, and therefore you cannot restore those colonies to the Germans.The next question would be: What will you do with them ? Well, they must beheld by someone as trustees on behalf of the nations, and especially on behalf of the natives of those territories. An international trusteeship always leads to trouble,exactly as our international trusteeship of Egypt led to troubleMR. MASSEY : And the New Hebrides.THE PRIME MINISTER: Therefore, let us choose the nation who is to act astrustee for each of these particular treaties. America would be the trustee for Palestine,and, if you like, you might even make her trusjtee for gome of the great african colonies. You might say : &quot; Will you take charge of the natives in that dominion onbehalf of civilisation?&quot; It is quite clear you- cannot leave them in this state ofbarbarism, which they have been in for so many centimes, that you will never pull
liethem out of it, unless, first of all, another nation comes in and does all for them.Great Britain will take Mesopotamia, purely as a trustee, also Samoa and New Guinea,and South Africa will look after South-West Africa. Would they regard that as a departure from their principles ?LORD READING: Not if it was real. They would if it was a mere paperstatement of a trusteeship. If there was a real trusteeship I do not think they would.I think Palestine would appeal to them much more than taking a trusteeship of the african colonies, of which really they have no knowledge, and they would dislikehaving to administrate them very much.   Palestine I do not think they would.LORD ROBERT CECIL: I think this ought to be discussed in connection withthe League of Nations. To my mind that is one of the great functions which theLeague of Nations ought to fulfil to deal with these very difficult territorial questionswhich are arising frorn tuns to time.THE PRIME MINISTER : You will have to deal with these questions before yougo to a Peace Conference, otherwise you will have great trouble.LORD READING : I cannot help saying, from what I have seen of PresidentWilson and the discussions that I have had with him, that you must be prepared tofind him of very strong opinion when he comes to the Peace Conference.THE PRIME MINISTER : Here is an extract from what he is reported to have said on the ,8th April, in the speech which he delivered. He ended up his speech by,saying, &quot;As to the Peace Conference., which must come some day, the position of theUnited States maybe summed up as jfchis:.&apos; Gentlemen of the Conference, we come here asking for nothing ourselves, and we are here to see you get nothing.&apos; &quot; I seethat he has since modified that in the official summary of his speech which is given tothe Ambassadors.LORD READING: Forgive me interrupting. We must be careful about that.On the contrary, he refused to let the Ambassadors have it. He refused actually to letanybody have it; it was not a prepared thing.THE PRIME MINISTER : This was given to me by someone who was present atthe meeting.LORD READING : Are you sure he is giving you the exact words ?THE PRIME MINISTER : I am told that he is a very reliable man, and I thinkit is very much like what President Wilson would say.LORD READING: He made this statement- A shorthand note was taken, and atranscript of those notes was presented, and I have seen it; in fact, I have got it, butnobody is supposed to have it, and that is not quite what he said. What he said was this, which is the shorthand note. I agree it may have been altered. &quot;Nobody hasthe right to get anything out of this war, because we are fighting for peace, if we meanwhat we say, for permanent peace.&quot;THE PRIME MINISTER : He may have said that as well. That is what we haveto bear in mind. The first condition is to see that he gets something, and then thesecond goes.Then we meet to-morrow afternoon at half-past three.MR. BALFOUR : About the publication of Phillimore&apos;s Report, as we have a minute before lunch, I might remind the Cabinet how the matter stands.MR. HUGHES: Whose Report?MR. BALFOUR : Phillimore&apos;s Report on the League of Nations. A Committeewas appointed by the Foreign Office, an independent and a very able one, practicallyconsisting of Sir Robert Phillimore (now Lord Phillimore), who is a great internationallawyer, three historians, and two Foreign Office representatives, and they drew up aReport which is in print and which we have circulated. We asked the Presidentif he objected to its being published. He said he did. I believe he wants to get out some report of his own. Lord Robert Cecil, I think, had better take up the text now,,as he knows more about it than I do.MR. HUGHES : When did we get this Report ?
- THE PRIME MINISTER : About a fortnight ago.LORD ROBERT CECIL : I think two were circulated, the substantial one was circulated some time ago now, when the Dominion representatives came here.SIR ROBERT BORDEN : The first one is the 20th March, No. P. 20.LORD ROBERT CECIL : It is not suggested it should be published now as theviews of the British Cabinet ; it is merely to be published as the basis for discussion ;that is all that is suggested, and I do not know that if that was made quite clear thePresident would object to that.LORD READING : He would not like it.THE PRIME MINISTER : Why ?LORD READING : Because he is anxious we should not ptiblish anything until he has had an opportunity of submitting a memorandum to you Upon it. If it is published by the British Government it carries of course greater authority, and he particularly asked that it should not be published.MR, BARNES : Has he a copy of the French Report ?LORD READING : Not before I left ; he did not know they were considering it.LORD ROBERT CECIL : I think it rather important to get something reasonable.Of course I am. very violently in favour of this scheme, but I am very anxious that weshould not be left merely at the mercy of the various schemes put forward by people who have not thought very much about the subject, and who merely sit down andwrite a scheme of a League of JSiations. Anyone can do that, and make a fairly goodscheme ; but it is only the people Tvho have been into it who know what the practicaldifficulties are, who are in a position to do it satisfactorily. I do not say that thescheme we have is perfect, or that it is right or the best scheme, but I do think it is ascheme that has been very carefully thought out and considered by competent men.It is moderate, and goes only a little way, and if it is found possible to go farther noone would be better pleased than I. What I am afraid of is that we shall be driveninto a welter of faddist schemes which have no practical value at all, and that thewhole idea will perish under that kind of flood. I do think it would be of greatimportance now to have this as a kind of standard for people to work to, and to considersomething which would stabilise and settle discussion on the subject. I quite agreewe must not do anything which will antagonise or annoy the President in a matter ofthis kind, but I do think we ought to try and see now whether, on those kind of lines,he would object to its publication. I think it is important, and I am not sure that ifyou leave it to the Americans we shall do very well, because I do not think they havebeen able to give very much attention to it.LORD READING : Very little.LORD ROBERT CECIL : And they do not know the atmosphere, the immenselydifficult atmosphere in which any scheme must be launched in Europe, at any rate.MR. HUGHES : Before any publication takes place I assume that it will bediscussed here, and that the Government will have a policy on it ?LORD ROBERT CECIL : You are very sanguine, Mr. Hughes.MR. HUGHES : I read a very interesting lecture by Mr. Barnes the other day ; ofcourse, I do not agree with it, but it was a very good one. Now then there is anotherCommittee Report. I have not read it, so I cannot say what it is, but surely on thisLeague of. Nations question everybody says something. You, Mr. Prime Minister, said the other day something about it ; you were very general and to your remarks no one could take any exception. But some of these days somebody will say something against it or for it, and those people will have authority, and then we shall be all committed.We ought to know what we mean.THE PRIME MINISTER: I should like to have the question of publication alittle more looked into. There are two objections which I can see to publication. Thefirst is if you publish this scheme, although you say : Well, this is not the government scheme, still, it does mean it has a Government imprimatur, and everybody will say this is the scheme of the British Government.   That is the first.   I do not think we
ought to publish it unless in the main we give a sort of Second Reading. Therefore, itis very important that you should have the scheme itself thoroughly discussed before you publish it. Now I have got an objection to publication which I should rather liketo consider. You know this war is not over yet ; it is a long way off, I am afraid. i cannot see Germany accepting the terms which we shall impose upon her withoutinflicting much more defeat upon her than we have done up to the present. I am verymuch afraid of a scheme being published which would get the people into the atmosphere of discussing that thing, and get their minds away from the victory whichis the only sure basis of any League of Nations. Are you quite sure that germany would not say : We accept the British scheme ; we think it is a very reasonable one ;there are a few details that- we should like to see altered just see what the effect ofthat wotdd be if, during the winter months when you have a sort of reaction from theelation of victory people get a little tired, peace talk begins about November and december, and then you launch this scheme and Germans say: &quot;We accept it.&quot; I amrather afraid of it.   I would like it considered.LORD ROBERT CECIL: I have pressed for months past that this questionshoiild be seriously considered, because I am sure you will agree with me that at anyminute you may have a violent demand from the people in this country to know whatthe policy of the Government on this point really is. At the moment it is not sobecause they are all elated.THE PRIME MINISTER : If by policy you mean whether we are in favour of a league of Nations or not. . . .      :MR. BALFOUR : We are committed.THE PRIME MINISTER : Then [ quite agree. If you mean by that, that it is going to be a violent demand from the people of this country for the details of yourscheme, that I do not believe. I think on the whole they will say: You gentlemenhave got to work all that out, and it is a very diffictdt thing. I believe they have got.it into their minds. There is a lot of common sense in the minds of the people. they say first of all you have got to have a basis, and upon that basis you form your Leagueof Nations. sMR. BARNES : We ought to consider for ourselves, I think, with the fullestknowledge.THE PRIME MINISTER: I agree.MR. M.ASSEY : Before publication.LORD READING : May I make one suggestion, Mr. Prime Minister, that weshould know what the Presidents view upon it is before you at any rate make publica-tion. I only want to make this observation, that the President for some time, I do not mean at all for the future, but for some time has been very cool about the League ofNations. He has definitely to my knowledge stopped a very big meeting which was tohave taken place, and at which Mr. Taft, the President of the League to enforce force,and President Lowell of Harvard University, and a number of very distinguished men,were going to speak, and he stopped it. In consequence the meeting which had been called turned to what was called a &quot; having the War Convention,&quot; and instead of-a Leagueof Nations meeting you had a loud beating of drums for war. That has gained strength in America, and the other has lost strength as the war progresses. I was suggesting that you should not commit yourself to any particular scheme, or even to the SecondReading of a scheme, until you have had the views which he wants to put before you.I know they are nearly finished. I have already heard some of them and I know thatthe matter is being considered, but I would suggest that nothing should be done untilyou have heard.   I should think you should hear in two or three weeks&apos; time.LORD ROBERT CECIL : I am afraid it is only too evident that some of mycolleagues do not want this scheme put forward.SIR ROBERT BORDEN : Even if I thought the proposal for a League of nations was absolutely impracticable, and that statesmen a hundred years hence would laughat it as a vain attempt. to accomplish the impossible, nevertheless, I would supportthe movement because of its supreme purpose and because it might succeed. I think we ought to do our utmost to support it. I am heartily in support of it, but I do seethe force of what the Prime Minister has said about the publication of the PhillimoreReport, and I think we ought not to publish it at present if the President so requests.[543- 6] &quot; F
LORD READING : That is only a question of a few weeks, but I know he is atwork on it.SIR ROBERT BORDEN : Does he propose to publish his memorandum ?LORD READING : No.MR. BONAR LAW : Do you think he has got a desire to be the first on the platform ?LORD READING : I do not think so.   If he did it would be-MR. BALFOUR : Not improper, but natural.LORD READING : It would be improper to hold us and prevent our publishingit until he has had the opportunity of publishing his.THE PRIME MINISTER: I have got the quotations which were sent me by aMember of the House of Commons from President Wilson&apos;s speeches about the Leagueof Nations, and they bear out what you said. I read them only yesterday. I wassurprised to see him take the line he has taken. If these mean anything they meant]be exclusion of Germany from the League of Nations until Germany has become ademocrapy in the British sense.LORD READING : I think that is very likely what you will find PresidentWilson will put forward.   I do not know because he had not come to it when I left.MR. BARNES: He always includes the word &quot;free.&quot;LORD READING: I do not mean he has changed his view about policy at all;he has a definite view which was not opportune at that moment when everything wasto be concentrated upon the war,SIR ROBERT BORDEN : This French [report is it an important pronounce-nient ?MR. BARNES : We have never discussed here. The report of the French hasbeen talked of in the House of Commons and in the House of Lords, but it has not beendiscussed here.LORD CURZON : You will haAre copies circulated, Sir Maurice ?SIR MAURICE HANKEY : I will ask for it.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,August 13, 1918.
APPENDIX.G-.T.-5515.--Memorandum fob the War Cabinet.War Aims.AS I was unfortunately prevented by illness from being present when war aimswere discussed in the Cabinet, I desire to place my views on record.I agree that the sooner a meeting of the Allies can be arranged in order to havea full discussion on war aims the better ; conditions have changed and reconsiderationseems to be necessary.   But before this step is taken it is obviously essential that we  -should be agreed upon our own view.I do not share the opinion expressed in some quarters that pacifism is spreading,or that the people are tired of the war in the sense that they would surrender on questions of vital importance to the Empire if they were made fully acqucUfld.il a.ihAmithem. I hesitate to express an opinion upon the military aspect of the situation, butI believe that we can and shall defeat the enemy decisively on the Western front, andthat when this has been achieved the other enemies will collapse.I regard the refusal to allow the German colonies to return to Germany asabsolutely vital to the retention of our African Empire, to the good government and progress of the natives, and indeed to the peace of the world. I do not believe in a condominium, the example of the New Hebrides is dead against thel success of thispolicy. But I would offer no objection to the suggestion that the United States ofAmerica should be asked to take some share in the future government of German EastAfrica,, if she is willing, and a working plan can be found. As regards the Pacific, Iam convinced any attempt to surrender the islands now in our possession would provoke violent opposition in Australia and New Zealand, and would be accompaniedby immense dangers to these two great sister nations, and might even strain their loyalty to breaking point.I would like to suggest that special maps should be prepared with the assistanceof the Admiralty and the War Office, showing the importance of all the german colonies to us, the advantages of their return to Germany in submarine bases, wireless stations, dep6ts for coal and oil, and the consequent power she would possess to attackour trade routes. I would send these maps to President Wilson, of course through our Ambassador, to the Allies, and to the Governments of the Dominions and crown colonies.I would also like to see the true facts of the case brought clearly before our peopleat home by special and carefully prepared propaganda.In conclusion, 1 will only saj^ I believe this war, with all its glorious sacrifices,will have been fought in vain, and that future generations will never forgive us, if weallow the pen to lose what the sword has won.W. H. L.24tft August, 1918.o
