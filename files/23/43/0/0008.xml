LORD CURZON : I have been asked, as Chairman of the Eastern Committee, tomake a statement to the Imperial War Cabinet about the position and prospects of theWar in the East. The Eastern Committee is a body composed of the foreign secretary, the Secretary of State for India, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff,accompanied by their expert authorities, General Smuts, and myself, and it has beensetup to deal from week to week, and, I may add, owing to the increasing urgency of theproblem, almost from day to day, with the political and military situation that arises in&quot;the East, and to advise the War Cabinet thereon.The area which I have to survey to-day is very wide. It contains many countries,many peoples of different races, religions, political interests and ambitions. It opensup to us a maze of problems which it is difficult to measure, sometimes even difficultto understand. &quot;The East &quot; of course, in itself, is a loose geographical phrase which requires definition for the purposes of my statement to-day. I am only going to dealwith a portion of the East, that which is frequently called the Middle East. You will see it defined geographically on the map which is in front of the members of theImperial War Cabinet. I think the blue sketch map is the more useful for our purpose, because it covers a wider area; the military and political action of our opponents because it is they who are converting this into one of the chief theatres ofthe war may be said to follow, broadly speaking, two parallel lines. The first is from the Black Sea, through the Caucasus to the Caspian Sea, then crossing the caspian Sea through Trans-Caspia, by the Trans-Caspian Railway, built by theRussians, through Turkestan and Central Asia, to the borders of Chinese Turkestan,the very heart of Central Asia, from which point the Chinese Empire stretches faraway to the Pacific Ocean. That is the northern line of movement and advance. Thesouthern line, upon which we and our enemies are equally moving, is the line thatruns from the eastern coast of the Mediterranean, through Palestine, through Arabia,through Persia, through Afghanistan to the borders of the Indian Empire. It is thecountries comprised within these two lines that constitute the Middle-East problem, the developments of which I am about to endeavour to sketch.The whole of this great area comprised in this map is a theatre either of actualwar of of probable war. That alone indicates the world-character of the problem withwhich we are confronted. It might, indeed, have seemed almost incredible four yearsago that, by the murder of an Austrian Arch-Duke in an obscure village in the heart of Europe, the whole of this vast area . should be involved in war. So, however, it is,and it is becoming increasingly involved in the war; and it may very well be thatthose whose&quot; eyes are almost exclusively concentrated on the West because of the magnitude of the forces there engaged, because of the peril to our shores, because ofits greater proximity to our lives are somewhat mistaking the real proportions andfocus of the case with which we have to deal, and that, as time goes on, they mayrealise that the Eastern is not less important than the Western theatre of war. I thinkit.is very important to lay stress upon this, not merely because the conditions which Ihave described naturally lead people to emphasise what is passing in the West, but because of the criticism, emanating very often from high military authorities, which H&quot;a*s b&amp;en apt to describe some of our outlying theatres of war in the East asfi,si de-shows.&quot;The campaign in Palestine and the campaign in Mesopotamia have been sodescribed. The description is not true, and it is becoming increasingly untrue. a It^ isnot true, first and foremost, for the reasons that those campaigns were undertaken, totheir inception, for a direct military and political advantage of the most obvious nature.The campaign in Palestine arose out of the operations in Egypt. It was necessary,more particularly after the evacuation of the Dardanelles, to defend Egypt from aserious attack. The Turkish invasion of Egypt was twice attempted and was twicethrown back, and with the forces thus released we were able to push forward into palestine. I will say something more about Palestine later. For the moment it is sufficient to remark that we were involved in the campaign in Palestine as part of thedefence of Egypt. The fact that we undertook this campaign to protect Egypt hassaved us from the necessity of holding up large forces in Egypt, quite apart from the severe blow dealt to one of the principal of our enemies in that part of the world.Similarly, the campaign in Mesopotamia was no roving expedition to captureterritory, it was an expedition undertaken to defend the western frontiers of the IndianEmpire. One of the earliest and most prudent acts of the war was the despatch from india of the forces which landed at the head of the Persian Gulf, and then made their way up the river in the direction of Bagdad. Circumstances occurred in connectionwith that campaign which I need not ahude to at the moment, but no one, I think, willdeny that the strategic objects of the campaign were, in the highest degree, sound, and
that they constitute an asset of inestimable value, as we find already, and may find inan increasing degree as time proceeds. Therefore, in regard to the Mesopotaniiancampaign, you should look at it,, not merely from the point of view of a blow dealt atthe Turks, but as a protective - measure for Persia and Afghanistan, and consequentlyfor India itself.Had that campaign not been undertaken it is pretty certain that the enemy wouldhave swept over Persia. He is endeavouring, indeed, to do so now. If you admit theenemy into Persia, Afghanistan is no longer secure. If Afghanistan is aroused the frontiers of your Indian Empire are in danger, and you are faced with a grave peril.Thus it will be seen from this preliminary sketch that the pendulum of war,swinging so fiercely in the West, is also swinging and, I think, swinging increasingly,towards the East; and should the prospect be realised, which was sketched out to us by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff a few days ago, in which the Western armies of the enemy are held up on the coasts of France and Flanders, it may very well bethat he will.devote a much greater effort to the East, and that even greater responsibility and risks will have to be incurred by us in that theatre.In the remarks I am about to make, I am not going to deal with the numericalstrength, of the various armies, with strategic or military dispositions, or even with theoperations of war ; I am going to try to present to my colleagues a general picture ofthe whole situation as it now presents itself in the areas involved.You may naturally ask the question: How came it that Germany, with herambitions in Central Europe, in Africa, and in other parts, of the world, thought ofturning her gaze and her ambitions towards the East? The policy is no new one.It has been germinating in the fertile brain of the Kaiser and his councillors for at least a quarter of a century. There had been premonitory symptoms of it,perhaps insufficiently noticed by us during that time, but now bearing their fruit.The. first overt act of the German military power was taken when the GermanEmperor, now a quarter of a century ago, ostentatiously took under his patronagethe then feeble and tottering power of. the Ottoman. Turk. We wondered why theGerman Emperor should pay his visits to Constantinople, Why he should be thefirst to patronise the then Sultan Abdul Hamid. That action on his part was fraughtwith a wide &quot;and sinister purpose. It was with a view to placing Turkey in ultimatepolitical and economic bondage to Germany, and laying the first stones of the causewaythat was to lead him to the ultimate conquest of the East.The next step was when, now twenty years ago, the German Emperor appeared inPalestine. Members of the Imperial War Cabinet will recollect the pictures in theillustrated newspapers of-the Kaiser, clad in a flowing white garb, riding in the guiseof a Crusader into the streets of Jerusalem and Bethlehem. From there he went toDamascus, where he addressed a great gathering and proclaimed himself the one and only western friend of the Moslems in the East. These were the premonitory symptomsof the policy that was impending. The thread upon which all the strings of this policy were to be woven together was the Bagdad Railway, which ran from opposite Con-stantinople through Asia Minor, and which was to place at the disposal&apos; of germany the resources of Asia Minor, and to take the Germans by easy stages to the head of thePersian Gulf and the frontiers of India.I need not go into the history of. that railway. It was regarded with keensuspicion by many people in this country, with a somewhat tepid and ignorant interestIby others. Fortunately it never matured. Had it matured I believe that we shouldhave been faced with one of the most formidable weapons devised against the securityof Great Britain in the East. For the moment the German policy in Mesopotamiawhich I have summarised is completely suspended. The earlier part of the line which runs through Anatolia is in the hands of the Germans and the Turks, and is themeans by which they carry their forces to the battlefields of Palestine and Mesopotamia.In the lower regions a different line along the rivers Tigris and Euphrates has been constructed for a very different purpose by ourselves. The old scheme of the Germanshas thus been frustrated.   That was the situation prior to the outbreak of war.When war broke out the Germans had not at that date much time to devote tothe East; the whole of their forces were thrust forward in a great torrent in thedirection of Paris and the Channel ports, with the object which we with so much difficulty but still with so much success frustrated at the time, and which is now beingreattempted in another form. But unable at that time to devote large forces to theEast, the Germans pursued their familiar methods of penetration into eastern countries.They proceed in this way : first, a skilful propaganda, directed by clever and un-serupulous instruments ; secondly, the despatch of emissaries, very likely long trained in advance, to the countries where they desire to operate ; thirdly, the pushing forward
of some subordinate all)7 as a sort of screen in front of them to meet the first shock ofthe battle ; and lastly, when the ground has thus ,been prepared by all these forces,the Germans themselves enter into possession of the spoils which have -been preparedfor them. Thus, at the beginning of the war Germany could not herself be very active in these territories of her ally Turkey, as she was involved in the campaigns with ourselves to which I have referred.Our campaigns with Turkey were three in number. There was the campaign inMesopotamia. Whatever may be thought of the circumstances which attended theearlier stages of that campaign, the misfortunes, the mistakes, and in one case the unfortunate disaster that attended our arms, no one, I believe, either soldier orpolitician, doubts for one moment that the strategical conception of that campaign was absolutely right,,that we were right to go up the Persian Gulf, to hold Basra, andto take Bagdad. Whatever happens in the war the fact that we succeeded in that object will be of enormous advantage when we come to sit at a Peace Conference. Thesecond campaign undertaken against Turkey was the campaign of the Dardanelles.That lies, I think, outside my range of observations this morning, but at the sametime I think everyone will agree that, whatever mistakes were committed, the strategical conception was also sound, and that if successfully persisted in/it mighthave had an absolutely overwhelming effect upon the future of the war. It had to be abandoned for reasons which all here know. The third campaign in which we were involved against Turkey wa^s that for the defence of Egypt. Twice their forces rolledup against the Suez Canal; twice they were repelled, and then we advanced into palestine. That is what happened in the earlier days of the war. Germany couldnot lend many forces to help her Turkish ally. She did, it is true, send MarshalFalkenhayn to Aleppo and to Damascus. Promises of German military assistance,which never matured on a large scale, were frequently made. German soldiers havebeen found fighting both, in Palestine and in Mesopotamia. We heard of a Germanbattalion the other day on the eastern side of the Jordan. But, broadly speaking, theTurks have been told that this was a battle which they must fight for themselves, andthat their future was safe, because, when it came to a Peace Conference, they mightrely upon it that the Allies would be forced to disgorge Jerusalem and. Bagdad asthe price of the evacuation of Belgium. Such was the situation in the&apos; early days ofthe war-Now I come to a turning point in the war, the full importance of which has, Ithink, only to be stated to be realised. There was a certain date in the war when theGerman ambitions towards the East suddenly acquired new force and vitality, and, withvastly larger momentum, have been gaining in strength ever since. That was whenthe collapse of Russia came. We are rather apt to look upon the collapse of Russiahere in its effect upon the military fortunes in the West. We see with a trepidationnot yet exhausted the great augmentation of German forces on the West by troopsbrought from the Russian frontier ; we see the paralysis of the Russian forces theni-selves, and the reaction of this unhappy event upon the fortunes of Europe is one of thephenomena of the war that is most present in our minds at the moment. The collapse of Russia had, however, a wider implication, and far more serious consequences. Itbrought about not only a great increase of force to the enemy in the West, but absolutedisorganisation in the East. The whole of Russia was laid out prostrate and impotentat the foot of an advancing Germany. The East once more became a favourable theatrefor her propaganda, for her emissaries, and ultimately for her forces. The real andtragic meaning of the disaster in Russia was not so much the increase of. forces to theGermans in the West as it was the opening of the East to a new campaign undertaken by her and her allies. All these phenomena which I am describing were almostimmeasurably accentuated by the second revolution, what I may call the BolshevikRevolution, in Russia. Then, as we all know, the elements retaining feelings of nationality and independence tried to set themselves up as separate Governments indifferent parts of Russia. Our policy was to encourage them, by money, by men, byadvice, by every means, moral and material, in our power, but they have unfortunatelycollapsed, and the whole of these wide areas lie helpless at the foot of almost anyconqueror who chooses to appear.The indications of this new and active movement in the East on the part ofGermany were first made quite clear when the armistice was concluded in December1917, to be followed by the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in March of the present year. Inthat armistice, concluded between Russia and the enemy Powers, article 10 providedfor the evacuation, independence, and integrity of Persia. That, you might think,could have nothing conceivably to do with what was passing in the West. v Article 7
of the treaty of the 3rd March, 1918, was even more significant. This time Afghanistanwas added, still more remote and still more difficult to understand, and the treatycontained these words : &quot;Basing this on the fact that Persia and Afghanistan areindependent States, the contracting parties pledge themselves to respect the politicaland economic independence and territorial integrity of these States.&quot; You can see atonce what these words mean. In the first place, they are a bribe to Persia and afghanistan, a bribe more particularly to Afghanistan, because, although Afghanistanis an independent State, she exists under the protection of Great Britain. Her rulerreceives large subsidies from the British Government, but is not allowed, under existing arrangements, to enter into relations with foreign Powers. Therefore this guarantee of the political independence and territorial integrity of Afghanistan was a distinct feeler for Afghanistan^ co-operation. Similarly, the passage in the treaty,besides being a bribe to these. States, was a direct challenge, for reasons which I willpresently point out, to the British power in Asia. Having paved the way by these clauses in the armistice and the treaty, let me ask you to follow me as I trace in itssuccessive stages the course Germany has since pursued.The starting-point was Roumania. The peace with Roumania placed that countryabsolutely, and, so far as Germany could make it, permanently under the heel ofGermany. The terms of peace provided for the complete future economic servitude of roumania. I will give as an illustration that feature of the treaty which compelled,the whole of the oilfields, the most prolific in Europe, to be leased to a Germancompany. Roumania was the first step. From Roumania the German pressesforward into the Ukraine. He makes a treaty with the Government of the Ukraine.Observe one of the features of that treaty. The cereals of the Ukraine, no doubt forthe moment exhausted by the incidents of the war, but full of enormous possibilities for the future, to the extent of 20 millions, are to be delivered over to the Germans.That is the second stage. From the Ukraine through Kieff, the sacred city, theGermans advances southwards towards the great seaport of Odessa, and the Black Sea.He captures Odessa; he moves eastwards towards the Crimea, and then, whether it beby an act of cowardice, or of treachery on the part of the Russian Soviet Government,it is a little difficult to make out, he obtains possession of the&quot; greater part of the black Sea Fleet. Even now I am not quite clear whether the/whole of the Black SeaFleet is in his possession or not. Part of it at any rate has gone to another port, and.it seems probable that the whole of the fleet must presently pass into the hands of theGermans, even if it has not done so already. The possession of the Black Sea Fleet,you can see at once, has double consequences. In the first place it opens tvp to theGermans, and their friends the Turks, the possibilities of going through the Sea of marmora and the Dardanelles into the Mediterranean, where, I may say in passing,every preparation has been made by the navies of the Allies to meet them ; but it alsoenables them to gain control of all the shores of the Black Sea, and to transport their troops through the Caucasus on its eastern side.The next stage is the Caucasus. I would ask my colleagues here to realise the enormous potentialities of that region. The Caucasus is, I suppose, familiar to mostof us as a long range of mountains rising to a great elevation, providing the historicline of severance in this quarter between Europe and Asia. We must look at theCaucasus as one of the greatest sources of supply of materials essential to germany that exists in the world. It is a country of great economic value. The naturalproduct of cereals is very great; there is an immense amount of threshed cornpreserved there in stacks ; there are mines of silver, lead, copper, and manganese,capable of being developed to a greater extent than anything previously attained. Onthe eastern shores of the Black Sea tea is already cultivated and is capable of much wider development, and when you get towards the western shores of the Caspian youcome to Baku and to Grozny on the railway line that runs to Petrovsk, and you findat these two places the most valuable oil wells in the whole of Asia. I believe20 per cent, of the production of petroleum in the world comes from these oil wells atBaku and Grozny, and you can well&apos; conceive that if Germany becomes possessed ofthese great resources, as she is on the verge of doing, she will be absolutelyindependent of American supply for the future. These few words, 1 think, willconvince my hearers of the enormous economic importance, apart from the politicalvalue, of the Caucasus.What are the political conditions there ? In the breakdown of Russia after therevolution, a government one of those well-meaning, but rather impotent, local governments was set up in the region of the Caucasus at Tiflis, which is the capital.We endeavoured, by such means as were at our disposal, to help it in every way-  [543-5] G
possible. It was honeycombed with discord, it suffered from lack of means, its military resources were inadequate, and it ultimately, in common with most of its unhappysisters, collapsed. The principal elements with which you have to deal in the Caucasus I am now speaking of the inhabitants are three in number the Georgians, on theeastern coast of the Black Sea as far as Tiflis, which was their capital ; the Armenians,and the Tartars. I will speak of each in a sentence. The Georgians, who are anancient people with a history, ctilture, and great traditions of their own, for the mostpart a Christian people, I suppose something like 2 millions in numbers, have taken the opportunity, naturally enough, to constitute themselves into a separate State, and,equally.naturally, Germany and Turkey have flirted with them and - recognised them.They are thus for, the moment disqualified from putting up any opposition to ourenemy, and may be regarded as being immobilised in the struggle.The Armenians, the most unhappy people in the world, have been broken bypersecution, destroyed by massacre, almost battered out of existence, with only a fewfragments remaining. Some of them are still fighting precariously in their own country between the Caspian and the Black Sea. Others are holding out at Baku itself.Naturally we give them what assistance we can, and naturally they look to us as their allies, and the Imperial War Cabinet must realise the fact that a victory of theGermans and Turks in this region means, in all probability, the final extinction of thatunhappy people. We are bound by every tradition of our policy, and everypronouncement of our leaders, to do what we can on their behalf, and there may yet betime to do something.The third group of inhabitants of this region are the Tartars. The Tartars you can understand will be, for reasons of race and of religion they are Mohammedans-ingeneral sympathy with the Turks, and indeed, it is the Tartar population of Azerbaijanin the north-west province of Persia, where there are some 2 millions of these people,who are inviting the Turks into Azerbaijan. Therefore, you have in the Caucasus asI describe it, not only all the prospects of great material advantage to the Germans,but you have a population in that part of the world either divided between itself, or,on the whole, more disposed to help the Germans than the reverse.We now come to a very curious phenomenon which has developed in the last fewdays. In this region which I have described Germany and Turkey are advancing side by side, but as they advance further competition is developing between the two, whichis not without some hope for ourselves in the future. When the peace with Russia was concluded, Germany handed back to Turkey those towns and provinces on the easternshores of the Black Sea originally held by Turkey for many generations, if not centuries,and taken from her for the most part by Russia in 1878. I allude to the port ofBatoum on the eastern shore of the Black Sea, and to the famous fortress of Kars, andthe Province of Ardahan. Of course, Turkey was delighted at the recovery of her losttowns and provinces, and the Turk on the eastern side of the Black Sea during Marchand April, almost unresisted, gradually possessed himself of the towns in the territoryknown as Trans-Caucasia-Ivars, Erzeroum, and Van. He has now advanced right intoAzerbaijan in Persia, to the shores of Lake Urumia, and his troops are in occupation ofTabriz. His advance is justified on two grounds which he variously employs. Some-times it is a pan-Islamic movement appealing to all the members of the Moslem Faithto join together and re-create a great Moslem dominion in the future. Sometimes the appeal is based on considerations of race the pan-Turanian movement-inviting thepeople of Turkestan and Central Asia once again to form a single nation. These arethe two pretexts upon which Turkey makes her advance. Simultaneously the Germans,somewhat alarmed at the Turkish movement and anxious to get the greater part of theCaucasus for themselves, have also appeared on the eastern shores of the Black Sea.Landing their divisions at Poti, they have taken them along the railway to Tiflis wherethere is a German Commander and a Council of War sitting. But now, as these twoAllies appear on the scene, this rivalry of which 1 spoke develops between them, andthere is a kind of race as to who is to get first to Baku. The Turks at the momentseem to be a little ahead of the Germans. The Turks are some 80 or 90 miles on therailway to the west of Baku. The Germans, of course, do not intend for a moment toallow the Turks to get hold of the oil wells at Baku, and the situation is almost comical.In this connection either yesterday or the day before we heard that the Turkish forces were firing upon, and were engaged in hostilities with the Germans. That is the somewhat confused and not over-encouraging situation which exists in the Caucasus.Now I want my colleagues, if they will, to carry their gaze eastward and to see what the capture of Baku by the enemy will involve. It means in all probability that unless we can destroy it in advance, the seizure of the Caspian Fleet not a very large
-asset, but consisting of a few gun-boats and a large number of steamers navigated bythe use of oil by the enemy is almost certain. The possession of the Caspian Fleet isvaluable for three reasons, firstly, because it gives the Germans, if they obtain it, thecontrol of the mouths of the Volga at Astrakhan; secondly, because it gives them themeans of transport across the Caspian Sea to the eastern side, where you will seeKrasnovodsk as the starting point of a new advance ; thirdly, it gives them anopportunity of conveying their forces, if so required, to the northern shores of Persia.With Persia I will deal in a moment, but you will see how the success which is effected by the seizure of the Caspian Fleet, and the crossing of that Sea, opens up the whole ofthe large question of Central Asia.From the shores of the Caspian Sea runs the Trans -Caspian Railway, built by theRussians some thirty years ago. In possession of that railway you are gradually takeneastwards through the State of Bokhara, once independent, but for the greater part ofthe last half-century in the hands of the Russians. From there you advance into the heart of Turkestan, one of the great cotton-producing areas of the world. You comeinto an area where there are large native populations- Tartars, Tajiks, Sarts, Kirghiz,until you finally reach the borders of Chinese Turkestan. Incidentally, the dangers ofthe situation are not decreased by the fact that, in that area at Tashkent, the Russiancapital of Turkestan, there are some 40,000 Austrian and German prisoners, not, Ibelieve, in a very good condition of physique or moral, but still capable, if armed and brought out, of exercising a very disturbing influence upon the situation. South ofthese regions, in the contiguous territory of Afghanistan, German emissaries have alsobeen continuously engaged in endeavouring-unsuccessfully, I am proud to say tosap the loyalty of the Amir.I have so far depicted the German and Turkish northern line of advance, sweepingthrough the Black Sea, the Caucasus, and the Caspian Sea into the heart of CentralAsia, and, in fact, covering and menacing the whole of the northern flank of India.Hitherto our action has; for obvious reasons geographical, military, and otherwise- been mainly confined to the southern line of movement, to which I alluded in theopening part of my remarks. I may perhaps be allowed briefly to tell my colleagues of the action that we have taken upon that line from the Eastern Mediterranean to afghanistan. I have already spoken of the campaign in Palestine. General Allenbyholds Jerusalem and some country a little distance to the north of Jerusalem, and at times has conducted successful raids across the Jordan. In more favourable circum-stances, had it not been for the necessity of taking away troops to the West, it mighthave been hoped that General Allenby would have been able to push forward his military forces considerably to the north, and we might even have hoped to see him inDamascus, which would undoubtedly have exercised a very material influence upon thefuture of Syria. But for the moment these ambitions are in suspense. The militarymovements that I have spoken of to the east of the Jordan bring us, however, into contact with one of the most interesting minor aspects of this war, where, to the east of the Jordan, General Allenby&apos;s troops are co-operating with Arabian forces.Arabia upon the map is depicted for the most part as a huge, staring blank, through which a single line of railway runs from Aleppo and Damascus to the east of the Jordandown to Medina. That railway was made during the last twenty years bylthe Turk inorder to maintain his connection with the Holy Cities, Mecca and Medina, which are ofcourse among the great assets of the Ottoman Empire. Early in the war, largely with our assistance, the Shereef of Mecca, an almost independent chieftain and the spiritual headof the Arabs, animated by hereditary hostility to the Turks, rose against them. Withour consent and approval he declared himself King of the Hedjaz. The Hedjaz is thestrip along the coast which contains the Holy Cities. His ambitions, which weencouraged, are to establish himself as the head of an Arabian confederacy which willunite against the Turk all those nomadic but not negligible elements that are scattered over the face of Arabia. He captured Mecca early in the day ; Medina has not yetfallen to his arms, but the forces under his sons have pushed eagerly forwards, and are continually cutting and holding up the Turkish railway of which I have spoken. Theyare actively engaged, in conjunction with us, in military operations to the east of the jordan, and we are hopeful of greater successes in the future. I ask you to give special attention to this matter, because, by the promises we have made, we are bound to the King of the Hedjaz. It would be disastrous and fatal if we were toallow the Arabian movement which is financed and to a large extent armed by us to collapse. Turkey would receive an enormous increase of prestige if she were allowed to flatten out this rising of Arabian power and to resume her old sway in thewhole of the peninsula.   By Arabia we must stand, not merely because of the promises
that we have made, but because it is Arabia which is to help us to solve the futureproblem of Mesopotamia.SIR ROBERT BORDEN : What is the population of Arabia ?LORD CURZON : That is very difficult to determine, as it is so scattered, andthere are parts which have never been penetrated by any European. Arabia is vital tous in the solution of the Mesopotamia problem. What I mean is this. No doubt the fate of Mesopotamia will be determined, in common with other acquisitions by conquest,at the Peace Conference. But one thing I hope and believe we are all firmly resolvedupon, and that is that these fair countries, with all their prospects of wealth in thefuture, shall never be handed back to the devastating dominion of Turkey. Thealternative to the Turk is the Arab. The Turk, as you know, is an interloper, who hasno affinity, racial or otherwise, with the people, and the disappearance of the Turk,which is already secured, opens up a future in which we may hope, if we have thestrength to do it, to create something like a new Arab State, which will be under british guidance and control, in that part of the world.I have now taken you through Arabia and Mesopotamia to the borders of Persia.MR. ROWELL : What countries do you say should not be given back to the Turk ?LORD CURZON : I am speaking of the whole area in which we are in military occupation in Mesopotamia. If you will look at your map, you will see that we have advanced from the Persian Gulf, first to the great commercial port of Basra, secondlyto Bagdad, and, finally, both to-the north and the north-west. On the Euphrates, wehold the valley of the Euphrates up to the place marked &quot; Hit.&quot; The Tigris valley wehold up to Tekrit- The river comes down from the mountains in the neighbourhoodof Mosul, and then spreads out into the plains commonly called Mesopotamia, whichare irrigated and fertilised by these two great rivers, the Euphrates and the Tigris,stretching from the desert on the west to the Persian border on the east. That is the region which we have captured from the Turks, and I hope that, whatever becomes ofit in the future, it will never be returned to them.Next we come to Persia. The Persian problem is becoming acute. Persia is anindependent State whose autonomy and integrity we have more than once guaranteed,and for which we desire no better future than that she should stand on her own legs.She is weak, she has a corrupt Government, she has no great elements of nationalstability, she has only been kept upon her feet for the last half-century by the rivalambitions of Russia in the north-west and ourselves in the south, aud she has, after theusual fashion of Oriental States, preserved her national existence by playing off one ofthese Great Powers against the other. The result of the sudden collapse of the russian forces on the north and north-west frontiers of Persia has been to open thosefrontiers to the enemy, and, for the moment, the military problem in Persia is threefold.In the first place, proceeding from our base at Bagdad, which, of course, has exerciseda wonderfully steadying effect Upon the military position in Persia, we are pushingforward into that country military forces which stretch from Khanikin, east of Bagdad,to the Caspian. The object of that cordon, which is being maintained by british officers, British forces, and armoured cars, in co-operation with a Russian force, still inexistence at the northern end of the line, is to shut Persia on that side to the enemy.Otherwise she might be overrun. I think that the very active steps we have taken in,the last six weeks or two months have enabled us to succeed in our object, and we havenow got to the Caspian. The Russian force under Colonel Bicharakof is proceeding toBaku ; in fact, he has already been to Baku himself to see what he can do in relief ofthe situation there. I think we have rendered Persia safe on that side. Whether wecan actively or successfully intervene at Baku remains to be seen. We are putting forward a military effort which is small in point of numbers, but big in point ofimportance.The rest of Persia presents two military problems. There right a good deal of disorder in the south, where a force of gendarmerie, called the South Persian Rifles,under a British officer General Sykes has for some time been in existence with aview to preserving local order. This force has never been popular with the PersianGovernment and has never been officially recognised by them. It has been the source of a great deal of trouble with the local tribes, and at the present timethe British Government are endeavouring to make arrangements to provide amore satisfactory solution of that problem. Then on the east of Persia you will see athin line dividing Persia from Afghanistan. Our object, asT think I have defined, isto deny Afghanistan also to the enemy.   For that reason we have had to establish a
cordon of troops from Meshed down to the Arabian Sea. These forces are partlyPersian and partly Indian and are controlled by ourselves ; they are a protectivescreen and are doing their work very well. The policy I have described we hope will succeed in keeping Persia out of the war. Whether Persia should be persuaded tocome into the war on our side it is exceedingly difficult to say. A great deal can besaid on both sides. It will be a good thing to have Persia as a friend ; if she becameour Ally it might mean obligations upon us which we might find difficult to fulfil. our main object is to deny Persia to the enemy, to have a friendly Government there, andto prevent her from becoming a focus either of German intrigue in her own territories,or a clanger to Afghanistan.Finally, we come to Afghanistan, and here we are approaching the frontiers ofIndia itself. I said just now that the Amir of Afghanistan has remained loyal&apos; to us tothis moment. He has, not been free from temptation. From the early days of the warGerman envoys have been in his capital and in other parts of his Dominion. in common with most oriental rulers, he has made ,it his business to temporise orostensibly to temporise with both parties. He entertains a German Mission at Kabul,and makes them comfortable, but he sees that they do nothing, and after being therefor six months or a year, he inform! them that it is desirable that they should seekhospitality from some other country. The Government of India are convinced that the amir has acted loyally to his pledges throughout. Whether we should encourage himto do anything more is a matter that remains for discussion. The great thing is tokeep him out of [the fight on the enemy side, and, if the occasion arises, we shouldstrengthen him, either in a military or political sense, by any means in our power. .I have now covered, in a sketchy way, the whole of this great area of conflict orpossible conflict, and I ask my colleagues for one moment to see what all this meansand to what it is leading. It means this, that Germany, if she be baffled in the West,either as the result of military operations or even as the result of peace, will turntowards the East. She can afford to give up everything she has won in Westernparts, in France and Flanders, if only this door in the East remains open to her. Ifpeace proposals were made now and the representatives of the Powers were seated at a peace Conference table, Germany could, I venture to submit to you, afford to give backBelgium, to make large concessions in respect of Alsace-Lorraine, to set upon theirfeet again the greater part of the wretched and feeble states of Central Europe whichhave been almost destroyed by her armies. She could afford to give up the whole of these,,ancl provided she were left to retain the string of subject-States she has created forherself on the Western borders of Russia, she would still have the illimitable range of future ambition and opportunity which I have been describing this morning. Let us,representatives of the British Empire who are here, realise fully that Germany is outin this war to destroy the British Empire. That is the first and foremost of her objects,and one of the methods of destroying the British Empire is not merely the destructionof her forces at Calais or Boulogne, but it is by rendering her position in the Eastinsecure. She sees that the power of Great Britain is built upon her overseas strength.I am not dealing for the moment with the Dominions, but the core and centre of theBritish Power in the Eastern world is India, and it is at India along these lines of advance I have been describing that Germany is striking. And observe that if she isunsuccessful now, if she does not push her forces right forward, as she is trying todo, or if she is held up by our efforts, the object will not be abandoned, but the attemptwill be renewed; and just as India for the last three-quarters of a century has been ina state of feverish, anxiety, and has consequently had to maintain large armies, andto tax her people, all for the fear of what might happen from a Russian invasion fromthe north-west, so that danger may be reproduced in what appears to me likely to be amuch more sinister and ominous form if the place of Russia in Central Asia is takenby Germany.What is it that remains for us to do ? What should be our policy in - thesecircumstances ? I think it was yesterday in the House of Commons in a speech madeby the Prime Minister or the Foreign Secretary that he was arguing that we must notin any case wash our hands of Russia ; that she is vital to the security of our positionin this area which I have described ; that either now, or in the future, or as soon aspossible, there should be built up a Russia ; and that no effort should be spared out of whatever elements can be found to recreate the Russian nation, a Russian Government,and a Russian State, even though it may take ten years or twenty years. That bulwarkmust be set. up to counter the victorious German Power both in the West and in the regions of Asia which will be open to her in the East.The second conclusion is this, that we cannot afford to give back to the enemy[543-5] &apos;    :    \ . D
Palestine and Mesopotamia. They are the two channels from which, if they werefrestoredto her, she would press down again, on the one hand, towards Egypt and, on the otherhand, towards the Persian Gulf, and, whatever may be the future of those regions, Ibelieve that the very strategic considerations which have led Mr. Hughes and otherPrime Ministers to speak so strongly about the retention of German colonies in otherparts of the world for the sake of the future security of their own dominions and theBritish Empire apply not les&apos;s forcibly in regard to Palestine and Mesopotamia.Whatever happens we must not hand back a weapon of so much power to theenemy.Finally we must endeavour by every means in our power to secureja friendly persia and a loyal Afghanistan, and, still further to the East, in the presence of my Indiancolleagues here, I say that the great barrier that we have to oppose to these ambitions isthat of a powerful, loyal, and contented India. India has played her part with vigour,with loyalty, and with success in this war up to date. Greater responsibilities awaither in the future. She will be fighting one day not merely for her place in the BritishEmpire, but for her own existence as a great people. And, finally, if we carry ourgaze still further to the east, does not all that I have been saying point to the supremeand crowning importance of getting in Japan from the Far East ? There is anothergreat area of possible advance north of the tract with which I have been dealing,namely, the regions of South Siberia and Northern Turkestan, which are well supplied with railways from Russia, and along which it is perfectly certain that Germany willpush her advance, and where the only means of holding her up is by Allied interventionfrom the East. If there is one conclusion more than another that I would impress upon you it is this : That the policy we are not pursuing to-day because of theopposition of the American President is the right policy, and the sooner we can throwour Allied forces in as large numbers as may be possible into the heart of Central Asiafrom that side, the more shall we facilitate the movements which our inferior forces aremaking in the South, and the better will be the chances of saving Asia from theGerman clutch.Such is my review of the Eastern situation.(End of Lord Curzon&apos;s statement.)SIR ROBERT BORDEN.: I do not think I have any remarks to make.MR. HUGHES : I have nothing to say except to express my very great pleasureand appreciation of the manner in. which Lord Curzon has set out these tremendousproblems, and to say that, as far as my view of the situation is concerned, I entirelyagree that the point upon which we must concentrate now is what you said yesterday,I mean Japanese intervention in Russia, and the rehabilitation by any means and byall means of Russia herself.MR, MASSEY : I only wish to say how much I appreciate the wonderful infor-mation which Lord Curzon was able to compress into the time he occupied in deliveringhis address.GENERAL SMUTS : I have nothing to add except to thank Lord Curzon.THE PRIME MINISTER: In regard to the question of Japanese interventionone very important telegram has arrived to-day from Mr. Lockhart, I do not knowwhether the Foreign Secretary has seen it.MR. BALFOUR : Most of the important telegrams are held up, I believe, by theRussians, whether simply to annoy us or with a view to decyphering thend I do not know, while unimportant things come through quickly.MR. MASSEY : Can you describe Mr. Lockhart&apos;s official position ?MR. BALFOUR: His official position is indescribable, and it is indescribablebecause he has to deal with an indescribable Government. We do not recognise theBolsheviks ; we have always refused to do that. I think it is more and more clearthat we were right. At the same time we thought it very inconvenient to have nochannel of communication on any subject with the Bolshevik leaders. Therefore, wehave accepted the arrangements by which a certain M. Litvinof comes here ; he doesnot see the Foreign Secretary ; he does not go to the Foreign Office, but the ForeignOffice have a method by which he can communicate anything he desires, to us, andwe can communicate anything we desire to him, and per contra we have  asked
Mr. Lockhart, who for many years was our consul-general at Moscow and who knowsRussia extremely well, to undertake to fill&apos;this very indeterminate and undefined position at Moscow, and he has been in the closest touch with the Bolshevik leaders and not outof touch wholly with important people of other parties. If anybody will study histelegrams since the Bolshevik Revolution, he will see that he himself has gone^through a considerable change of idea. He never was a Bolshevik in the s*ense of acceptingBolshevik doctrines, but he believed, and quite rightly believed, that the Bolshevikswere the only people, as I am afraid they still are the only people, who are showingpowers of organisation and energy, at all events, in certain aspects of their work. he also had a firm belief I do not know how far he retains it in their honesty. He didnot, of course, deny that there were Bolsheviks in German pay. Russia is permeatedwith German influences. The whole place is covered with German spies, and evenGerman officers in uniform. There is no concealment about it, but he believed firmlythat the Bolshevik leaders were absorbed in their own political schemes and speculationsfor a revolution which was to embrace the whole world in its circuit, and that theywere in no sense acting as German agents. I do not really know to this day whether hewas right or wrong. I think he was right about Lenin,; I am not quite as sure aboutTrotsky. At all events, it is only too certain that they did exactly what the Germans,which Lord Curzon has so admirably explained to-day, desired to see accomplished.It is throxigh them that the Black Sea Fleet has fallen,&apos;if not into the German hands,has become quite useless for commanding the Black Sea. They were specially warnedabout the dangers months ago, when it could easily have been parried. They promised that in no circumstances would that fleet fall into German hands. Tbey have broken thatpromise, as, indeed, they have broken many other promises. It seems that their power iswaning, but no other power is taking its place. Mr. Lockhart is in a very difficult andambiguous position ; not only is he without precise diplomatic status, but he has gotto deal with moving sands of a quite unstable national situation in Russia. While heis doing his best in Moscow, there are efforts being made at Murmansk and at Archangelto keep a bridgehead, at all events, by which we can enter Russia. We have sentGeneral Poole to look after those interests, but they are full of difficulty. I amdisquieted about the later news, I think it is not comfortable becaiise our forces thereare very small.THE PRIME MINISTER : The news from where ?MR. BALFOUR : Murmansk and Archangel, our forces are small and cannot be reinforced, as we had once hoped, by the Ozecho-Slovaks who are, I think, sufficientlyoccupied in the centre of Siberia and Russia. It is very difficult for us to increase theforces. If the forces are increased it is very difficult for us to supply them, and I am afraid that there is trouble ahead, but the Admiralty and the War Office are bothrepresented here so I will not touch on that point. There is one more thing I mightmention. We have sent out a mission under Mr. Lindley, who was First Secretarywhen we had an Embassy there, and who knows Russia well. We sent out with him a large number of commercial experts, and he will try and organise the variousmissions that we have in different parts of Russia. Mr. Lockhart will be under him in one sense. As at present advised we do not propose to interfere with Mr. Lock-hart^ initiative in dealing with the Soviet authorities in Moscow and elsewhere. also  may say he is in constant touch with the American Ambassador, with the french ambassador, and.with the Italian Ambassador, who are none of them accredited to theSoviet Government. None of them are living at Moscow, but have taken up theirabode atWologna, which is a railway jtmction, I think some 300 miles east of Moscow.Part of Mr. Lockhart&apos;s duties are to consult with them, to keep in touch with them,and advise us of what they are thinking. I think&apos; that gives you the best account ofMr. Lockhart&apos;s activities.MR. HUGHES: When you gave us that admirable review of the position theother day you said something about the attitude of the President of the United states in regard to Japanese intervention. Since then certain statements have appeared inthe press and certain communications have been handed to us. The situation haspossibly changed, and I wanted to know whether, as a fact, it. has changed, andwhether you are exerting any direct and urgent pressure on the President ?THE PRIME MINISTER : May I just interrupt here &apos;? I think we ought to havea discussion on this subject with the view to giving instructions to the delegates ofthe Imperial War Cabinet who will attend the Allied Conference at Versailles next week, and with the view, I hope, of making a further communication to the President.
I think before we discuss it I should like to circulate amongst my colleagues herea report of&apos; an interview I have had on the whole position. I think that ought to bevery carefully studied.MR. BALFOUR : You mean in regard to your conversation with M. Kerenski ?THE PRIME MINISTER :- Yes, it is rather an important interview. It bearsupon all these problems, and I should therefore like to see this discussed on Thursday,but we might have a preliminary discussion before that.MR. BALFOUR : Another document which will have to be considered, but whichI do. not think has been circulated yet, is one received from the Japanese Ambassador.It will be remembered that at the last meeting at Versailles on the 2nd or 3rd Juneit was decided that we had better invert our order of procedure, and instead of tryingfirst to press the United States President to come in, and then go to Japan, we should go to Japan and say : Will you come in if you are invited by the United States andthe rest of the co-belligerents ? In obedience to that, as you know, we sent an invitation to Japan. The answer to that invitation was given to me yesterday by theJapanese Ambassador. It is not wholly satisfactory, and I think that the documentitself and. the conversation that I had- upon the document with the japanese ambassador, of which I at once wrote down an account, should be circulated before we meet again..THE PRIME MINISTER : That, of course, is vital.MR. HUGHES: There is only one thing, and that is President Wilson. TheJapanese are very anxious not to run counter to the wishes of the United States.MR. BALFOUR: There is one rather disquieting sentence with which 1 will nottrouble you now, about not committing themselves to going further east than theeastern provinces of Siberia.MR. HUGHES : I would not press that.   I would let that be so.THE PRIME MINISTER : We had better have a discussion on Thursday afterreading this document.MR. BALFOUR : Is it not important that it should not be generally known thatM. Kerenski is here?THE PRIME MINISTER: It is very important that it should not be known thathe has had an interview with any Minister of the Government.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,June 25, 1918.o
