t H&quot; J G^MKRAL SYJC1S;    In drawing up, this paper, Sir, I have tried to survey the air position, first of all from the land point of view,then from that of the sea, and finally to see whether, and in whatway, we can &quot;build up a further and. direct striking air force.     Theair strategy of this force can soon be built up after a review hasbeeVi wade of what la absolutely required to hold the enemy and to co-operate with the Armies and the Fleet as has hitherto been done,I should here.like to ask that the conclusions which we have-tried to arrive at in regard to this question should be kept verysecret, as the objectives for which we are working will inevitablytake a long time-to achieve.Taking the first point, - the employment of the Air forces with the Armies, - the.Hoyal Air Force is called upon to co-operate with the Armies in an ever increasing number of roles - reconnaissance,photography, observation of artillery fire, location of hostilebatteries, contact patrols with Infantry, counter-attack patrols,bombing attacks on communications, and - a rol^e which has recentlyvery much gained in importance - that of firing upon ground targetsclose behind the line, or within a short distance of the line, with machine-guns and by dropping bombs upon them,     we hava perhaps alittle too much tendency to think of aircraft operating only with theArmy on the Western Front, and it is for. that reason that I shall lay stress here and there upon the air work which is being carried, out inother theatres.     Aircraft are at present co-operating with the armies in France, Italy, Salonica, Palestine and Mesopotamia.     In Indiathere is a small nucleus of air force, consisting of about 1-1 Squadrons,available for co-operation on the Frontier.     it is interesting toglance at the growth of the Air Service in these various theatres.   As4you will remember, when we first want out we had/Squadrons to accompany the Bxpeditionary force,SIR ROBERT BORIKNi How many aeroplanes are there in a Squadron?GTSFSRAL At that time there were 12;   now there aregenerally 18, but it depends upon the aise and type of the

machines; Squadrons consisting of the largest machines have 6 per^Squadron.    In 1914 we had, as I. say, a total of 4 Squadrons.   To-day in France there are 74, with their innumerable auxiliary units., Blse-where in 1914 there was nothing, except a single flight of aeroplaneswhich was collected locally in Egypt*egypt has formed the nucleus of expansion fox the Middle TSsst.There are 11 Training Squadrons and flying Schools in that country,,aad this number is now being increased to 21*   There, are also largerepair bases in Egypt, a considerable aircraft depot, two aircraftparks, and, three/wing repair sections.    In Palestine there are 5 Squ&amp;d-prons, in Salonioa 3, and in Mesopotamia 8*   With the exception ofPalestine, which is dependent upon Sgjcpt for supply, these theatreshave their own aircraft parks and other echelons of supply and repair-:a very important factor        One sometimes has an Idea&quot;that aircraft&apos;squadrons ean be launched by themselves, that is without their auxil-, plenipoteniary services, v/hieh are very heavy in personnel, material, .transport,etc.%ypt has also detached Plights during the past two years toco-operate with the King of the Hejaa&apos;.and Arabia, with the egyptian army at Barfur, and with troops operating against the Sonussi on theWestern Desert.   Going still further afield, the Squadron, which/-carried - out so much useful work in Bast Africa, was partly helped from%ypt, though it was derived largely, especially in regard to personnel from South Afrioa*Italy is a comparatively now theatre*   A Brigade of the RoyalFlying Corps, as it then was, accompanied the British troops whichwere sent there last September.   This Brigade was shortly afterwardsreduced to a wing of 4 Squadrons,   This wing has been of the gratest value, according to our reports, both to the Italian Armies and to ourown forces operating in Italy.Turning to operations with the sea forces, at the beginning ofthe War the total strength of the Uaval Wing of the Royal Plying Corps-we were originally, as you will remember, organised in a Military Wing,a Naval Wingand a. Central Plying School, and /

my; functions were before the F/ar to try and build up 8 Squadrons,-consistingfbf a heterogeneous collection of 41 aeroplanes and51 seaplanes, located at six different stations in Great Britain,Bases- wara shortly afterwards&apos; established at Oatend , Antwerp andBunk-irk, but with the exception of five seaplane   carriers whichcarried out one or two raids, no really vary serious co-operationwith, the tTavy was attempted in 1914.   nevertheless, when theDardanelles campaign started, the air work was carried out entirely by $aval Units.Row, however, a53 regards the Fleet, aircraft are reoognice$asan essential auxiliary.   I thin,! the First Lord   will hear me outthere.   Already the importance of aircraft in $aval action is such that the fleet provided with, the larger and more efficient equip-raent may, even though numerically weaker in surface vessels, havea very much greater chance of defeating the enemy, or at&apos;least of itself escaping defeat,.  There are&apos; now 14 aircratft carriers, and an ever growing numher of battleships and cruisers are &quot;being fitted tocarry one or more aeroplanes for reconnaissance or fighting work.The machines fly from the decks or tops of turrets, which constituencies-utes a great advance.   In addition, large Flying Boats are employedfrom bases on the north and East aoasts, for reconnaissance of the heligoland Bight and for patrol work over the various barrages.The second great function of aircraft with sea forces is toassist in the anti-submarine campaign.   The results obtained haveshown its very great Importance, and, as a consequence, they have led to the establishment of 45 aeroplane and seaplane stationsround the British Isles.SXR EGBERT BQXDBHs   Is that Including Ireland?SSSB1A1 SYlOSSi Yes.   The Americans are now taking over someof the seaplanes bases in Ireland.   They are marked on the map,on the South.

SIB HOBFJiT BQRDBM:   How many machines have you in thosestations in the aggregate?0isB;^Hisl* SYK3SSJ    I have not got the figure here.     It is 43.Flights of seaplanes, and 30 Flights of aeroplanes8 a Flight being on an average 6 machines.     There are also a total of 76 airships ofall types.     These, except for the provision of personnel, are not atpresent under the control of the Air Ministry.     It is- the intentionof the Admiralty to try and increase considerably the number of air-ships employed.     The small airships have done an enormous amount of-work lately in mileage, and, I think, have had a deterrent effect--&quot;-&quot;&apos;&apos;-&apos;upon submarines coming to the surface.-    As the First I*ord told us,their object &apos;is to try to keep them &quot;below and down to the lower- mines.The Bunkirk-Beyer group, also operates with Havai Forces andhas been linked up with the group attached to the Fleet.     Dunkirk,was formerly under the Army, or part of It was, but new it is definition-itely allocated the Viee-AdmiraX at Sever, so as to assist in the-never work.     The machines from Dunkirk also assist him materiallyby bombing  eebragge, Bruges, Ostend, and so help to keep down the submarines emerging from those places.Turning to the Mediterranean, the present strength amountsto a total ,of 6 Squadrons of aeroplanes and seaplanes.     These areemployed mainly on anti-submarine work,-but reconnaissances and attacks on the -Austrian bases and on the Dardanelles are also carriedout.     An airship station has been established, at Cassandra, and one is projected for Malta.Mr QKAMBKBiAXM:   Where is Cassandra?$&quot; SKliMs -SYKES:   In Greece - there.     Also, as you see, Xhave marked the projected balloon stations for anti-submarine workdotted about in the Medi tor rime an there... Mr EOWSLLj Are those marked in blue- the projected ones?&apos;mmsmm, KYOS:   Those are the existing ones, and ^hpselarethe projected.     That covers, very briefly, the functions of aircraft with the Armies.in the Field and with the Fleet.

Mow I should like to turn to the direct Air Offensive     *I The question of the necessary number of Squadrons or units to bemaintained with the Amies ami with the Fleet has been much debated,it has often been said that there cannot be enough aircraft anywhere,but it insist be remembered that we only have a certain, number, and thequestion to be answered is therefore what is the greatest numberthat can be usefully employed in the different theatres, and whether we cannot5 over and above that maximum, employ cur surplus to advantage in a more direct way.   What it scrams to me Is the right standpoint isthat we must be superior in the air everywhere.   If we maintain thatsuperiority with the Armies5 and I think we can fairly say that we aresuperior with the Armies everywhere now, and if we can maintain oursuperiority with the Fleets we should then look for a way of trying to aim at what may be called strategic interception - getting&apos; at the back of the armies end of the production, and of the formation inreallythe field, and strike in what X believe to be the only/practical wayat the root industries of the enemy.   One sometimes hears it argued9  .more or less on the lines on which 1 am at present stating the ease, -Why not put 1,000 or 10,000 aeroplanes into the field?   If you look at that small stretch of country behind our Front, you will see quite clearly the answer to that question,  torn, cannot concentrate such forces in that small piece of country.     In a comparatively smallway General Salmond massed 300 aeroplanes at Amiens to help to impede the eneay*s attacks    Of course something more than that might havebeen done, but the extent to which It is sometimes stated it shouldbe carried out I think is quite impossible.Turning to consideration of what we may sow call the strategicstriking arm of the Air Force, the first elements of this werecreated in October last in the shape of three Squadrons.   This littleforce was established in response to a popular demand for reprisals -wereThe Squadrons/used chiefly against the German ironworks inthe Lorraine Basin, and against the Gorman chemical industries in the vicinity of Mannheim.   The force was, of course, too small

to.achieve really groat results, but the moral effect of these re-prlsa-1 raids was, I think, eonsidarable.   It is also to be notedthat these attacks caused s very marfeet? Increase in anti-aircraft defences, entailing the immobilising of personnel ana material,these three squadrons which have been taken as a nucleus,-it isproposed to build up into a very large and powerful strategicstriking force8   You will see its grouping on this other maprather hotter, in that area.    Here is. the headquarters of theforcei here are the American headquarters of their Armies;   andthis is the depot for the maintenance - of our air forces con-centrated in the area,   the green labels are the aerodromeswhich the Americans are now trying to get made for the Air forces which they are going to. form in this&apos; same centre.9SB PS1MB UI&amp;XStBBi   What is the red?ifllMS SYXSS:   the red indicates our -own units. Our head-quarters are there? the Airosaft Berk is there; that is a Frenchaerodrome? these green ones are the Italian; these red ones areours 0Arrangements are also being made to build up another strate-strategic force in England, with the idea of striking more directly at certain parts of Germany.   Ton will see that to some parts ofGermany it is shorter directly from England than from any other area,the objectives of these forces may be classified firstly as attacks on sources of munitions supply, with the object of crippling theenemy1s land&apos;operations in every theatre of war, $ftp more particular-larly on the Western Fronts secondly, attacks on the submarine equip-meat factories sad submarine shipbuilding yards, with the object of-striking the submarine menace at its root; and, thirdly, numerousattacks by small foroee over a large area throughout Germany, onthe larger cities, with the object of securing a widespreaddislocation.of municipal and industrial organisation. Although itis convenient to bear In mind these three aims, the means of carryingthem out will necessarily interact, and it will be difficult to assign, any particular&apos;objective&quot;to any one of them, the weather is &amp;

very important factor, as wall as the types of machines available.In regard, to the munition supplies, we have studied thequestion very deeply., and have came to the conclusion that theindustries, in their order of importance, are        the chemical industries, the iron industries, and the machine shops.      It is interesting to see on the map the grouping of these industries.     Youwill see that there are three great groups.     They are very concentrat&apos;ed and centralised, and form excellent targets,LORD mmmx   They are all in Western Germany?GSNISHAL SXKKSt     Yeo, or; the Rhine - Westphalia.LOUD KILN1HJ     All oh the aide which is vulnerable from here?GSJIBBAX, 8300*8:     Yes..   &apos; Take this group, Frankfort and Maintz   ;and then this southern group, Longwy, Thionville, Saarbruken etc.,which, from our point of view is very convenient.     We are very fortu-nate in that way, and. also, to turn for a moment to the subject of -Home Defence, and we are very fortunate in that our own munition factories have grown up all over the country and arc not concentratedtwo ofin groups.     As we have seen/the principal areas are already within reach of our small strategic striking force.   The third and northernone, however, is very difficult to reach as yet.     We hope that before long it will be a good deal easier.Other very attractive targets are the Bosch magneto works atStuttgart, which are estimated to produce ?0 per cent of all themagnetos used for aviation purposes.     The built of aeroplane enginesare made at Mannheim and Stuttgart.     Then, with regard to the second part of our classification, practically the entire manufacture ofaccumulators for submarines is centred in &apos;two small groups of factories.     These, unfortunately, are at rather lohg range.     Afurther series of targets, lies, of course, in the Heligoland Bight,I turn now to my third heading, to which. 1 want to call yourspecial attention - the widespread, dislocation of municipal effort and industrial effort throughout the country.     The aim of such

attacks will &quot;foe to sow alai*s broadcast * create uncertainty as to&apos;where an attack is coming next, and - stimulate an outcry for anti-aircraft defences, which means a mass of material, a mass of     $0personnel,, and an enormous outlay in munition effort.   The air-craft of our Home- Defence locks up a great - many men, - and that issimply the result of a few raids.   One can imagine what would bethe result in Germany of a really serious continuous -effortagainst them *After careful study of all these considerations,- and tuepresent programmes of production and personnel, supply, we have worked out certain lines of attack upon Germany,    I think, however,they are too long to go into, here, but the,principle is, broadly speaking, to ley cut a certain amount of strength on the dislocat-ing effort,, everywhere, -just referred to, and than to - concentrate the whole of the remainder of our resources on the different vitalpoints&apos; and absolutely crush them.In conjunct ion with this system we have also worked out a scheme of strategic air routes; that -is to say, that if the armies were heavily attacked, or if it was essential directly toco-operate with the fleet, we could, by means of these strategic-air routes, concentrate a force bo as to assist at what hadsuddenly&apos;become a vital point.   Some of these strategic .air routesX have shown there on the map.   The green lines in $ranee are aseries of air routes with which the French have supplied&apos;us.   1asked for. them about two months age, and they have given us   thischain of routes by which aircraft can be moved from point topoint.-   The red line is a route which we have worked out so ae tobe able, if necessary, to fly aircraft to salonica, and, I hope,later on, to &amp;gypt, although our difficulty there is the last bitbetween Suda Bay and Bo Hum which is about 210 miles across.. Butas far- as the land route goes, it has, of course, been done several.&apos;times, and I do not think that it -will present serious difficultieswhen once we get aircraft moving along to it. le hope its use willnot be necessary, but it is very important to have something inthat v?ay ready.Turning to Home Defence, the defensive measures which have&apos;;hitherto been devised are, of course, defence e squadrons, anti-atee?aft

oxguns and searchlights, &quot;balloon &quot;barrages, reduction of lighting,&apos;protective works, camouflage, and ao on.    All of those absorb agreat amount of personnel and material., as I have said, and, mustof course,be created at the expense of the Armies and of the Fleet,and of our Strategic Striking Air Force.    It is therefore obviousthat we ought not really to proceed along lines of defensive measures,and I think that the alternative method, namely, the destructionof the enemy&apos;a aircraft&quot;bases and attacks on his aircraft factories,and supply arrangements, will afford very much&quot;better protectionthan the setting up of a large defensive organisation at homo.The Allies are beginning to lead in aircraft production both as regards quality and quantity.   If the special measures which Ihave touched upon can bo carried into effect, the superior resourcesof the Allies, especially when assisted by America, should ensure usso large a preponderance in the striking arm as to leave germany with very little margin for air raids.    If the British and Americanprogrammes can be realised - and to ensure this we want the closestsupport - the Strategic Striking Force should -fee by June, 1919, beable to deliver certainly hundreds of tons of high explosives at ablow, end with such/force I do not think Germany would have verymuch margin to divert aircraft for an attack on England,    I. have mentioned the fact of our horse industries being widely dispersed, soI will not touch upon that again.    It is a very important factorthat Germany, although in many ways having the advantage of interior  .lines, has, in this particular respect, rather a disadvantage.If I may now turn to what I have called the methods for developing our air power in accordance with the various phases, Ihave tried to outline, first of all we have to ensure the greatesteconomy of our present establishment and our future resources, inorder that all surplus to actual naval and Military requirements maybe utilised,to build up this striking Force.   To carry it into effectit is imperative that the allocation of all the available aircraftresources shall, in the first instance,rest with the Air Ministry,and that it shall supervise generally the use to which /

allocations are put.   I think the necessity for this ia a jusbifica-tion for the step which was taken by the government in creating aseparata Air Ministry&quot; to allocate the resouroes and view the air ,problem as a whole,   our experience has established to within eora-paxatively cloas limits the number of aircraft that are necessaryfor the service of the Navy and of the Armies In the Field.   combined with this knowledge of the tendencies of development and the rateof production, it should be possible to prepare a combined programme to cover all requirements in all categories, and from thence toconsider the development of the Independent aerial force whose elseand power should be only limited by the Empire*s resources.    sir robert Borden has rightly stated in his Paper that the Royal AirForce ia an Imperial Service.   The energetic co-operation of theEmpire in this effort ia, we think, an imperative necessity if successis to be achieved.   We are now, on our. part,, moat grateful for the  -remarkable effort &apos; which Canada has made to help us in the Air Force.We hope that this will continue.   The effort also of Australia hasbeen very great.    South Africa has representatives in almost everyair-formation which crosses the line.   India has not yet been developedbut we have taken the matter up with the Indian government in orderthat we may draw upon India* s vast resources.   We have in India a potential  reserve which should assist to develop the Air Force to cope with a possible menace to her frontier and with the danger in persia to which the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and LordCurason have referred,    On the other hand, if I may say so, 1 should like again, although&apos; perhaps it is reiterating,  to refer to the factthat if we can hit Germany absolutely at the source of her munitionssupply, it seems to me to be very, difficult to think of her pouringany vast material resources at all events into.the East.If this policy of striking at Germany&apos;a centre is right, wehave to collect our forces in all .these ways.   I have referred toour work in Egypt, and that also,, of course, will form a very strongnucleus from which anything Eastwards can.expand.   From the review

I have gone through you will see that, if properly organised&quot;developed, there is no doubt whatever that the air forces of theEmpire will remain the dominant factor in aerial warfare in 1919.We have also to aim at a co-ordination of effort, sis I have said,not only in the Empire but also with our Allies.   A certain amountdealhas been done in this direction, and we hope &amp; great/more will bedona, but unless we can ensure that co-ordinated effort it is goingto be- very difficult to achieve full value from this striking policy.If I may, I should liice to refer in a few words to what I personally- and I only say this from my own point of view - &apos; think as to howthings stand broadly at the present and in the immediate future..I should like, also to say a few words on the more distant future k -before going into my conclusions and recommendations at the end of.this statement.    In the next war it seems to mo that the existenceof the British Empire will depend, primarily upon its Air Force, Imay perhaps be over-enthusiastic, or at all events I.may be puttingtoo &quot;much importance upon it, but that is my conviction.    The giantaeroplane of to-day will inevitably develop in striking force to something analogous to an aerial Dreadnought, but even -the presentaero plane, if produced in sufficient numbers, could, on the out-break of a fresh war - which we hope will not come - quickly securesuccess for that Power which possessed undoubted aerial supremacy.The First Sea Lord told us yesterday that the Pleet was so different from the Army owing to the speed with which it was necessary to get a move on: well, I think in regard to the air the difference seven greater still.    If this is remembered,&apos; the ever Increasingrange and speed of aircraft make it certain thai the menace willthreaten the Dominions as well r-s the Mother Country.   It must beborne in- mind also that the enemy of to-morrow may be nearer to a dominion then to England herself, and the bearing of this on Germany1&amp;expansion through Asia and her ambitions in Africa is - obvious.   Itis imperative, to my mind, that the first line of the Air Force ofthe future shall be&quot;always upon a war footing.   The existence ofsuch a Pores ready to strike Is undoubtedly our surest means ofdefence.    &apos;when, ira audition, to what I /

new factors&apos; sees to he first the rait that naticnai&quot;&quot;SYmxars arcngnx-ing. - the whole nation is fighting,     The second great factor isthe air, and the third is the submarine,     I touch upon the. nationalfactor because it has such a direct bearing upon what we are trying to effect from the air.     This War, unlike any previous wars, is inthe fullest sense a war of nations.     The&apos; entire population and thewhole weight of the resources and industries are thrown into thebalance.     The success.of the Armies or Fiesta depends entirely-uponthe energy and moral of the nation.     It seems that hitherto what maybe called &quot;battering-ram tactics&quot; have been employed both by theenemy and by ourselves.     On both sides all the resources-have.been thrown in;   the -Armies have been thrown in and piled up against eachother;   the national production of material has been&apos; countered by approximately similar effort on the.other side.

Thosenew factore&apos; eeem to be first the fact that national armies are fight-ing. - the whole nation is fighting.     The second great factor isthe air, and the third is the submarine.     1 touch upon the nationalfactor because it has such a direct bearing upon what we are trying to effect from the air.     This War, unlike any previous wars, is inthe fullest sense a war of nations.      The entire population and thewhole weight of the resources and industries are thrown into thebalance.     The success.of the Armies or Fleets depends entirely uponthe energy and moraj of the nation.

There has been un-parallelled expenditure of resources of the two civilisations, andthia competition is still in progress, piling up against each other.

The avowed aim, it seem a to me, of our.strategy to-day may he eat- -pressed in the words &quot;national attrition&quot;.   This leans me to say, -is there any&apos; other factor or method which can he employed?   1 thinkthat factor is the air.   The Air Force has shared in this expansion,in this piling up, concurrently with the Army and thei Fleet, and,curiously enough, as it has&apos; expanded it does not seem       1 may he-wrong here       to have had a greater ratio of effect&apos;to the Army thanit had in the beginning.   We went out in the beginning, and I thinkthose four little Squadrons did no re to save the Army at the begin-ning than any one factor.   Although we have &quot;taken on -new functions, ,new attributes, carrying out tremendous work, and so on, I em not certain&apos; whether, relatively,  it is of. greater value.   The ratiostill looks more or less the come.   But now,  if we can maintain thatratio and keep that superiority which must be kept,  if the Germanbuilds up his air force as against us we must build up ours against him: hut if we cannot do that, it seems to- me that there is a new factor, and that new factor is our striking far back.

85,The avowed aim, it seems to me,  of ou^ strategy to-day may be ex-pressed in the words &quot;national attrition51.    This leads me ta say, -is there any other factor or method which can he employee?    I thinkthat factor is the air.    The Air force has shared in this expansion,in this piling up, concurrently with the Army and thet Fleet, and,curiously enough, as it h&amp;S expanded it does not&apos;seem       1 may hewrong here       to have had a greater ratio of effect to the Army thanit had In the beginning.   We went out in the beginning,  and I thinkthose four little Squadrons did more to save the Army at the begin-ning than any one factor.    Although we have -taken on new functions,,new attributes,  carrying out tremendous work, and so on, I am not certain&apos; whether,  relatively,  it is of greater value.    The ratiostill looks more or leas the same.   But now,  if we can maintain thatratio and keep that superiority which must be kept,  if the -Senaunbuilds up hi3 air force as against us wo must build up ours against him: hut if we cannot do that,  it seems to me that there is a new factor, and that new factor is our striking far back.

It is within our power however,  to ensure a sufficientdefensive air strength how to maintain that superiority and to buildUp at the same time this strong Ion.-;-rang arm.A review of the possibilities of this strategic attack,then, results in the conclusion that if such attacks are carriedout in sufficient strength they will, achieve a dislocation of rauni-Uon industries which lie at the root of all German military endeavours-our, will deal a heavy blow at the submarine at its source,  and bring about a far-reaching political and&apos;moral effect in Germanyitself.    As the offensive is a dominant faster in the war,  so wethink that this offensive in the air is a dominant factor in the air.

til inSIB WILLIAM WJSXB.;       1&apos;erhaps you would like me to amplify anregards certain phases, the statement which the Chief of the Air   .Staff has aade.    He ha&amp; given you, of course, a very full andeomprehensive picture of the.air situation from the strategicstandpoint,   vith the policy which he has set out X am mostthoroughly in support, and the endeavour of -the Air Ministry willhe to carry that through so far aa ever possible.Mew 1 think yon would probably prefer to hear from sue some ofthe-difficulties, and some of the practical limitations which we-have.   We are&apos; frequently asked this questions   Why are we unable toat once expend the Air Force to clear the skies of German machines and destroy German towns, and in a very broad sense, to -win the -war through the air?   Naturally the answer to that ie that the pre-reparations for an overwhelming aerial campaign are of exactly thesame character as any ether everwelmlngly strong, either military or naval, campaign.   As far as you can sum them up they are the oldquestions of man-power, time, and training.   If we could take skill-ed labour from the naval and munition work to make aero engines, ifwe could take men from the army &apos;to build&apos;up ear training aerodromes,with their accommodation; if we could take still more men from thearmy for air mechanics; if thousands of men could be taken from thearmy to build huts,aerodromes,..-and - rap-air shops in Jranee as bases for the new squadrons; if we could rob the- Army and Navy of stanysenior officers, then probably General Sykes might be able to guarantee an air victory, in say, two years frem now, butnnfortun-ately in that period we should lone the war.We new have 214,000 officers and men alone in the Air Force,and to give you some idea of our requirements we have 65,000 men inthis country engaged on building training aerodromes and other buildings*KB. KOWBL&amp;i   Is that in addition to. civilian labour?BIB WILLIAM ft&amp;IB:   Civilian labour numbers - about 140,000 muchof which is female labour.   Female labour is a very large pro-portioe,. especially in regard to&apos; the- -manufacture of aeroplanes.HJu EbGHBS.&apos;    How many &quot;pilots have&apos;you -. that -would indicate

I suppose, the number of -machines.&apos; soLUB WILLIAM WJSXB: You mean what is the number of machineskept in flight?MB. HUGHES:. lee.SIR ilLXIAM. WI2IB: Take the Stone y area alone, there are20,000 men from the army engaged in that work.   The plans which general Sykes indicated as to the developments of the force expected in September 1919, allowing for a very considerable increaee inefficiency of utilisation, comprehend that we shall require about$50,000 officers and men to manipulate 380 as against 1E2 active service squadrons operating to-day. -;     O- As regards long range bombing machines used for this in fiependent striking force, I presume.that you desire to have some information about that.   We propose to have continuous bombingover the whole-  4 hours, which means the use of day and nightmachines.   Sow the day bomber for long range work represents, thevery highest demand that is made on aeronautical design, and I amhere really speaking for my friend. Mr. Ghurohill, because it is really hie responsibility.  -Perhaps he will allow me to make these points.   Such a machine^, you will understand, must go this - long distance, and come back.   It must take accordingly a very heavyweight of petrol.   It must also take a reasonable weight of bombs, otherwise it is no use.   In addition to that It must be fastenough and armed powerfully enough to cope with short tango enemyfighting machines.   That is asking a very great deal from thedesigner.   Sow we have machines which are doing that at the present,moment and we will have machines very soon which will do it stillbetter.   General Sykes referred to a single attack on Cologne theother day,   the &apos;single attack was made because-with the machinesGeneral frenchard has at - present you require absolutely perfectweather conditions to carry out the-&quot;operations. &apos; We will give you machines very shortly which will have a very much larger marginboth of petrol capacity, speed.and climb.   Accordingly he willbe. able to attack Cologne or /

OAother pieces of equal radius on a very much larger number of 0**days.   To give you an idea, of those net? machines they carry about800 lbs. of bombs.   Their speed is between 125 and 130 milesan hour at IE9000 feet, and they have six hours petrol enduranceat that speed.   Coming to the night bombing machines, those ofcourse carry much heavier loads at very much slower speeds.   the proposition is therefore generally much easier,    in the past the night bombing machine for long range work although it *existed in the country, was not developed very thoroughly.   Forexample up to January this year, the total output in the country would not exceed, from the beginning of the war, something like70 of these very large machines.   Well, last month So wereturned put;   next month it is hoped that 70 will he turned out.So that is progressing very well.   These are also machines of6 hours petrol endurance, of about 85 miles an hour speed, andthey carry about one tone - those are the night bomhers.   the machines used behind the line for bombing are small machinescarrying a small load for 10 or IS miles behind the line.   Therehave been further developments in the night bombing machines,some of them now in construction having much greater endurance,approximately 12 to 14 hours, with a speed of a 100 miles an hour, carrying ljv tons of bombs.It has been said and is Very commonly believed that inregard to bombing machines, there should be no difficulty in providing plenty of pilots, because it Is a very easy machine to -pilot, and the pilot is trained like a chauffeur.    It is not so.The demands that are made upon the pilot in the bombing machinesininvolve longer training than/almost any other branch chiefly onaccount of .the difficulties of navigation.   The navigation train!must be very long and very thorough.   01Qua flying requires long experience end long trlanlng, especially in bomb dropping.   Theuse of the modern bomb sight has become so complicated that it involves very tedious and long training for that kind of work.In fact you may say/that

that bomb sighting is becoming approximately like artillery work.We hope, perhaps in 18 months, that the shooting from aeroplaneswill approximate,in accuracy to artillery.     We are now engagesin changing all the bomb designs.     The bombs are&apos; being improved,as projectiles, to correspond to the increased accuracy of sights.THIS PRIME JilHXSfEBi   How soon do you hope to achieveaccuracy?8th WILLIAM WJSIKs    We are now using a certain number of experienced pilots at home instead of using them in France; we have sent them to Stonehenge to a special school of bombing and theyare training others.TUB PRIME MINISTER:   Could you hit a battery?8Iu &amp;lLLIiO  \miVLi    So.TIBS PR1MJS MIIISTER;   Suppose you were aiming at six guns,,would you be quite sure of hitting one?SIR WILLIAM mmt    1 think so, at a radius of 30 feetdropping fi-om 12,000 feet.Ml BALPOURi   Then you could hit a ship of war.SIB WILL I-AM WEIR i    Yes.THE PRIME MIHX3TKRj   How soon do you say you can achieveaccuracy?SIR WILLIAM WK1RJ    It depends whether the machines onwhich to teach the bombers are sent now to Prance to meet the verygreat demand there, or whether we use them for training.up for nextyear which we feel rather inclined to do9 at the same time trying to keep things moating at the front,     I hope -you agree with me intaking up some of these smaller matters. sir ROBERT BORDKH.   How long does it take to train a manto do this, bombing work?SIR WILLIAM: WEIR?   The whole course at Stonehenge of  -flying, bomb sighting,, directional wireless, and navigation, takesabout 10 weeks that is apart from his ordinary flying instruction.

**X9**  .....- -mThe next point whieii has frequently arisen, is thequestion of s tandardi sat ion,     It is often askeds   Why cannotwe make acre engines in the amae way as, say. Ford motor cars.The answer is simply this.    That there is no type of aircraft which we know of at present which could be put in hand atonce in large enough numbers to cover all the functions requiredfor aircraft $     If we had such a machine we could not perfectthe manufacturing processes on a sufficiently large scale to turn out the machine&apos; for some considerable tiro and it would consequently be obsolete just about when you reached production.I can give you a very good example from my persons 1 experience.When X came to, the aircraft work I was very anxious to bring aboutstandardisation and it was obvious that there was only one typeof machine that one could start with, and that was the trainingmachine *    Both the Flying Corps and the Naval Air Service agreed on a specific type of training machine.     They said - This iscertainly the best machine.    That machine, with its engine, Xstandardised in March and put it Into production.    The produc-tlon cams in November, but unfortunately in October a brightyoung officer discovered an entirely nm system of flyinginstruction which revolutionised the whole thing, and made that machine quite useless.    Consequently everything had- tobe cancelled.We have msde very great progress in standardisation.At the beginning.of the year there were 39 types of aereplanesito-day including training machines there arc only 14 types, andon our: front in France there are 9 types.    There will be, apartfrom any entirely now developments, only 6 types to perform these functions in February next year.SIR ROBERT BORJDEM %   Do they all perform different work?SIR WILLIAM WEIR s    Yes - there are two kinds of fightingmachines.   I should like to point this out, that the tendencywill be to increase the number of types as the functionsincrease.    The low flying machine is quite a new type which

protects pilots completely against armour piercing bullets at point blank range. Of course, it has a very limited field of usefulness and only gets a proper target during a battle. The Boche is so good at hiding himself that only targets are seen during a battle; so that by the development of this type of machine a certain amount of energy is being put into an item which has a somewhat limited use.

Take another class of thing which might apparently be standardised in this country - the aero motor.     The Nolls Royce aero motor is most excellent, probably the best in the world, but in order to standardise such a motor it would call for such a mass of perfect facilities and organisation and very highly skilled labour, that the country cannot provide it. We are making as many as ever we can. America has studied it very carefully. America says - No, we cannot make this it would really not be possible for a long time. We are turning out or have in progress a very large number of high powered aero motors, but only a proportion of them are Rolls Royce because we cannot make sufficient. In that respect our new motor, which we call the A.B.C. which is a very big step in advance, fortunately has the advantage of being easily manufactured.

THE PRIME MINISTER : How is that turning out ?

SIR WILLIAM WEIR : Very well; tip to now we have had no trouble at all.

MR. BALFOUR : What is the weight per H.P. of the A.B.C. motor ?

SIR WILLIAM WEIR :

 SIR WILLIAM WEIR : Take the German motor of 260 H.P. it weighs about 920 lb. This A.B.C. motor is 340 H.P. and weighs 500 lb. and of course is very much simpler.

 MR. HUGHES : How does it compare with the "Liberty" motor ?

 SIR WILLIAM WEIR : The "Liberty" motor is a motor of say 380 H.P. and weighs about 900 lb.

 MR. CHAMBERLAIN : Are you satisfied with it ?

 SIR WILLIAM WEIR : Up to now we are absolutely satisfied with it; so much so that we were able to send Lord Roading, for publication in America, a telegram stating our confidence in the "Liberty" Engine. The delay in the aeroplane programme had caused a good deal of disappointment and dissatisfaction and the tests which we have carried out, justified us in encouraging the Americans to push ahead with production.

 MR. HUGHES : Which is the best motor of the three ?

 SIR WILLIAM WEIR : The A.B.C. is unquestionably the best on performance but the "Liberty" motor will be very useful for at least the next twelve months for the long-range machine.

 LORD MILNER : Whose invention is the A.B.C. ?

 SIR WILLIAM WEIR : It has been about eight years in development by a small firm.

 Another point which has been raised is the question as to whether we are using the scientific ability



Mmability of the eouatxy sufficiently la aircraft work?$here again I am speaking fox  Sr. Churchill but 1think ho will agree with me that the rapid developmentof.aeronauties during the war has been based verylargely indeed on the assistance given both directly and indirectly by the scientific men in thiscountryt       this assistance has been rendered partly by the advice, of men of standings sitting upon.Committees, and partly by the use within the technicaldepartment of the younger scientific men.      Shemost important of these Committees is the mainAdvisory Committee for aeronautics under the presidency of Lord Eayleigfe and the Ohaiiwsaship of air RichardvJlaiebrooka,        ffeey dictate the work which has tobe done, at the National Physical Laboratory&apos;and wepractically keep the national Physical Laboratory going on aeronautical work alone.        $his Committee has... see ft for engines, efco*, one of which Isunder air fiujpsld Clerk and the other under ProfessorPetavel*        In the department itself, where of course the actual work of applying the scientific resourcesof the country to the design of aeroplanes is -done,that is carried out fey the executive officers in thetechnical department.        I could name at least 50.of these men of the highest scientific &quot;training whohave done before the vmt all kinds of original research work apart altogether from work la connection withaeronautios*       $hen there is an experiajental branchwhich is under Colonel Mepkinsen.. himself a verydistinguished professor,.wao is also responsible forenlisting the services of all the University laboratoriesin

la the country.   A very largo numbor of theso laboratories are engaged continuously on work for the air service *    I do not think:there is any branch of war work where fuller advantage has beenta&amp;ea of scientific men in the country.   She proof of that ofcourse is the degree of superiority which we possess over theenemy,     hat is not merely a belief, because all the Germanmachines wo bring down, and we bring down a considerable -numberintact, ere sent over here, ere taken to experimental stations,flown, tested and all the results are recorded on exactly thesame basis, &amp;o we dc know what the Germans are doing.ME. HQW&amp;S; You know of course how many bow types theyhave introduced in any given time.SIR IILLIALI V/l&amp;lR: Of. course one of the outstanding reasons of our superiority to-day is because the Germans standardised too soon,   fhe proof of that is the fact that he cannot bomb throughthe day.   He can send a machine which can come over here and whichwould be able to defend itself but it would have no bombs when itgot here.   We have lost in the past through, putting our energiesin&apos; all. sorts of directions but we are now reaping the benefit ofit.   It may not have been a good policy in the past but still weare getting a benefit from it.SIB HOUSE!? BGRBlfh What is our effective range for bombing and how much has it increased during the past twelve months?BIB WILLIAM SfBXR: $waive months ago all our machines, withthe exception of the Eandley-Pags machine, vie re designed for use with the armies; the fighting machines do 2-4- hours, and there connaissance machines about 3f- hours.    Shis year, both our day and night machines do 8 hours,SIR ROBSR3? BORDEH: How much in mileage?- 5IS WIU.IAM Wilts. Roughly 8-50 miles,&apos;the total distancethere and basic; you must make allowance for weather etc.SIR ROBERT BOEDEB: Is it anticipated that the range will be considerably Increased?

UIK WXEbLOl mmi Yes,&apos; very considerably increased.. *wME* BOIAH LAW; Wxen do yon expect to go from London to Berlin?8 IK WILLIAM WEIR: It is something lixe the case of the terrasnmachines you could do it to-day but you would not carry anythinguseful to Berlin, besides there are many splendid targets without going to Berlin,Reverting to the question of technical development which youalways associate, with aeroplanes and engines, that ia only onebranch; accessories have developed equally fast and. they are very-complex and far reaching.   To give you a slight idea of the obsour-Ity of these things, about six weeks ago I asked the ConjointCommittee of Boyal Societies to investigate for us the question ofglue with special reference to the milk obtained from a certainbreed of cow in India.Then the question of replacement Is rather important.   It isnot only a matter of supplying aeroplanes to build up squadrons inFrance but it is a question of supplying aeroplanes to maintainsquadrons in Fronee and to replace those squadrons frequently with new types.   I*or example, by this -time next year with the exceptionof two types of machine, the Ksndley-Page and the Bristol* everytype of machine in France will be changed, or in process of change.low- let us taxe the aeroplane figures.    In Idlh the out-putwas  ,000, in 1916 - 6,000, in 1917 - 14,500.   for this year itamounts to 14,500 to date, and the figure will be something like30,000 for the year.   The engine figures in British and Importedare approximately the same.   We are now quite Independent of anyother country as regards aeroplanes but we are not independent asregards engines.   We still get engines from franco and America andfor a very long time we shall require to go on importing engines.MR. CH0.R0SILL: The importation of engines is one of our diffio-ulties.   In this connection we have bean arranging for a month torefcove some&apos; of.the. Paris factories and if the Libertyengine

illengine were delayed that again would affect our calculations.SIR WILLIAM WEllt   You might be interested to know wherethe output goes.   A typical squadron of single-seater fightingmachines in the future will constitute Z5 machines on the lineready for notion, 8 as a reserve, 8 for&apos; lessee before the&apos;squadron gets to France, and 12&apos;in the corresponding training&apos;-squadron,, making 53 In all required to a*fce- a squadron st the &quot;:&apos;,:kvery beginning*SIR 1G3BBT BOlBBIs   How many flying men will be allocateIto thatfSIS WILLIAM mint. fwenty-five. . in regard to the largeHaadley-yage machines, the squadrons will be constituted of 6machines on the line, 2 reserve,&apos;8 for preparatory wastage, for service trainings   We build up rather more than onetraining squadron in this country to keep one service squadron in the field continuously.WTSmwmi   What is the crew of the Handley-page?SIS WILLIAM Wills   It depends on the work it lias to do.Sometimes it carries three and sometimes five for the toag range *TH5 mZM UIBXafSSt   How far will they go; as far asCologne?SIB WILLIAM msiBs   They have gone to Cologne at night in vary good weather.   They carry a. heavy load of bombs butthere Is no margin of fuel.   One point about the squadronswhich requires to be watched is that the man-power associateswith each of these squadrons, for. handling, mechanics, andgeneral operations, is based on equal.man-power establishments.You want to know where all this output -goes to and ix^-ii^iSSMthis connection diagram. 5 is rather Interesting,   the blackrepresents..the number of machines In charge of the training    vtA^ilbrigades all over the&apos;world, including Great Britain, so that.very large proportion is training.

 LOW MILNER: This is our great offensive arm.

 MR. CHURCHILL: The Dunkirk force does a good deal in that way.

 SIR WILLIAM WEIR: This diagram shows the expansion to be hoped for by January 1st 1919 of the independent force; the little one is what it was in January last; the middle one is what it should be on 1st July and the last one is what it should be on 1st January. Incidentally the July one will not be realised because in view of the impending battle and the necessity for bombing certain railway junctions we have temporarily diverted some squadrons going to Nancy.

 THE PRIME MISISTER: What do you think is the effect of that bombing?

 GENERAL SYKES: I think it has a great effect; it delays the traffic; I think it is very important really.

 THE PRIME MINISTER: What is the effect in Germany judged by the effect upon our lines?

 GENERAL SYKES: Of course we throw a very much greater tonnage upon them than they do upon us and if one can gauge it upon the result in regard to ourselves I think it is excellent.

 THE PRIME MINISTER: What is the effect of the bombing of troops in action?

 GENERAL: It has a tremendous moral effect and a considerable practical effect.

 MR. BONAR LAW: Do they ever fly behind and attack from the rear instead of going in front of them?

 GENERAL SYKES: Yes, they attack on the roads mainly, and the points of junction and crossings and so on.

 MR. BONAR LAW: The fear of their being attacked from behind must have a very good effect.



Sill WILLIAM mm: Mother great moral effect is produced when those machines dire straight down at the troopsalmost vertically instead of flying on a leva! keel downwardsand in this connection the beat results have been achieved bythe.single seater machine with the fixed nuns in the hands ofone man       the pilotsAn General Sykes indicated the demands on man power are going to be heavy, and this brings up the question of thedifficulty in connection with senior&apos; Officers.      It is said thatthere is a low degree of efficiency in regard to the utilisation of man power in the Air Force,     Take a Squadron Commander, inthe first place he must be a skilful pilot.     He must&apos; have gonethrough the mill; that means he is between 22 and 28 years ofage.     He hag had probably an average of 21 months   experiencealtogether; you put this boy in command of 200 men, 20 other officers, a mass of very complex technical organisation somethingapproximating, let us say, to a small ship.     In the case of a ship it -would he commanded by a man of lb years training and yetthis hoy has to look after the whole of this organisation.Consequently, some allowance must he made for inefficiency andthere may be Seme lack of dlcipline hut we are doing everything possible to improve this.     We are striking the right note in theCadet School where the hoy goes from the commencement and we are having tremendous help In this connection from a CanadianGeneral - Critchley who is doing marvellous work in the trainingof the cadets.     The flying Instruction has also been entirelychanged in character.     Last year, of the pilots -going overseas,there were 10% who had less than SO hours&apos; flying.

esgSa? -J- -la April of this year there were no pilots who went IviPseaswith leas than SO hours flyings   20% of between 40 and 50 hours9,2Q% of between 50 and SO hours&apos;, 2cj% of between 60 end 70 hours * andthe balance had over 70 hours in the air*   lore than that prior to six months ago each hours single straight flying was considered effee-tive but to-day during every hour that he is In the air the pilotmust beilearning something.    When you hear about a considerable proportion of accidents there Is no doubt whatever it Is associatedwith this faots but on the other /:&apos;hand a boy who goes to France now is very much better trained than previously *   There may bo a few ad-dltional deaths in this country but it saves a large number of deathson the other side.The aerodrome and accommodation problems in this country arevery large and difficult *   I might read the character of the worksinvolved in the programme - repair depots , acceptance parks, storesdepots, and day and night flying home defence stations.   Then thedifferent classes of schools are in themselves a formidable list -schools of armament, aeronautical, artillery and Infantry co-operation,balloon schools, cadet schools , equipment officers&apos;8 schools, schools for aerial fighting, and gunnery j   schools for navigation and boding,photographs and special flying,. establishments for the training ofmechanics and for the teaching of telephony and wireless.   The areainvolved in those is 50,000 acres and as I have said there are65,000 people engaged in that work *   On the seaplane work alone11,000 acres of aerodromes and works are In hand .X would just like to repeat what General Sykes has said inconnection with, the tremendous amount of help the Royal Air Force hasreceived from the Colonies, and in connection with Canada to pay a tribute to the very high degree of efficiency they have attained.I think that the Canadian Aeroplane factory represent certainly thebest factory on the Continent of America and it has been mado amodel for the Americans *   In, connection with Canada,&apos; as You are aware,we have brought back from France two very well known Canadian offio-ers one of whom will toe attached to the Staff and theother

other will take over an important command in this country.In conclusion rather than say any more about the differentdetail a I feel that probably it would be better that you should see some of them and with that object I would like to arrangeallfor you/to come and have lunch with some of the leading officersin the flying corps;    then we Would go to Croy&amp;on to see thelarge -national factory which is the biggest, aircraft factory in the world; then to sec a modern acceptance park outsidethe factory; . then we&apos;would have one of each type of machine-used on the different fronts and also Mr. Churchill might have one or two of the new types.   Later we might also have.aseparate day to see some of the naval work. - I suggest Monday,July 8th, if that can be made possible.o a a aTHE PRIME MINISTER:    list are those diagrams ?81R WIT J. I AM WEIR:   These show the results.   You cannotrecord the results of the Royal.

You will notice there isa eozaplete change in the situation this year.This is the output diagram of aeroplanes since theMinistry of Munitions took it over in January last year, andthe red line above it&apos;is the engine production.MR. BALFOUR:    Is it right that the enterprise of theFrench flying men is very inferior to what it was ?SIR WILL I At? WKIR:    They do not pull their weight in pro-Portion to the amount of material,which they have.   AtMontdidier our eleven squadrons probably did more work than allthe French aeroplanes in.the French army.THIS P8.IM1 MIKI^TKR:   Have the Germans more machines onour front than \te have fGEMBRAL SYKESj    The Germans have&apos;here over 900 against our 4v.Qs  the re the French have a higher number so that betweenthe French and ourselves we have more than the Germans..SIR WILLIAM WEIR:    It is necessary to explain that thatwas at the beginning of the year when they (the Germane) were at full strength.    Those estimates are mace on the assumptionthat the squadrons are at full strength at the beginning ofthe season, but the Beehe cannot maintain his squadronsthroughout the year.    We maintain our squadrons.    It does-notmatter What happens to-day,  to-mcrrow morning there will hethe same number available for fighting.MR. BALFOUR:    What is the limiting factor now ? - imagines,aeroplanes or wood ?SIR WILLIAM WEIRi   Engines are the limitation.    As regardssending out to France completely equipped squadrons, it&apos; is a close race between;material and trained--personnel.Backwardnessin our training is attributable to want of accommodation ataerodromes.. we what the use of 30,000 women for example, butwe cannot use them because we have nowhere to/  .accommodate

accommodate them.SB?. CHUHOHILL j $he Royal Air Force has rot a capital of .15,000 aeroplanes in-their possession at the present timeand a monthly income of from two to three thousand,   $hey have got something like 2,500 engaged in continual,flying againstthe enemy but I think it ought to he possible to pay a biggerdividend than that.   Although the immense difficulty of gettingsquadrons organised must be recognised,, I am quite certain the air minister and Ms Board ere not entirely satisfied that the maximumdividend is being paid for the capital invested.SIR WILLIAM MR; The wastage is very high.   Last &apos;month the -wastage figure was 1,783 aeroplanes.-MR. HUGHES: $he labour you have got for making engines:is it as efficient as it possibly can be ?SIR WILLIAM WSIBs It is   uite good,    $he labour Iwas referring to is the labour engaged&apos; on making aeroplanes,that is ordinary labour.   We have also German prisoners engaged on them.$HE PRIME HISI8$1SR: Has en agreement been arrived at between th*Ose in   charge of the strategy of the Allies and thosewho are producing aeroplanes as to the part which aeroplanesought to play in the strategy of the future ?   Has there beena consideration, say, of the campaign of 1919 as to the partaeroplanes ought to play ? &apos;kGMSRAL SYKBSi   We have a committee at Versailles whichhas met once or twice and has been tackling that very point,only, as you know, the yronch are not very keen upon thisstrategic fighting;force,   $heir idea rather is that the wholeof the Air force should not bo utilised by armies but theyshould be. grouped in bombing squadrons along the whole length &apos;of the line and bomb Germany whenever possible,   $hey do not agree that to bomb actually into Germany is specialised work, $hiswork, of course, entails training and organisation, and it is notpossible

&quot;possible to carry It oat effectively spasmodically,   Their linerather is that it should be carried out spasmodically as andwhen possible.TH71 PRIME MI8ISTER: It is only a &quot;side-show&quot; with them,$he answer to this is&quot; in the negative.     $here really has notbeen anything thought out as to the relationship of the AirForce to the general strategy of the campaigns.GBH13BA1 SYKK3: We have met twice and have come up against a brick wall*Tm PRIM&quot; MXUISTBR;   There must be all sorts of things that the Air can take part in.SIR -WILLIAM vmiR:   There is a meeting, which takes placein Paris once a month nfileh cleans up a good deal in regard tosupply.   The Inter-Allied strategical meeting at Versailles willnot make ranch progress because they do not speak out frankly inconnection with this long-range bombing.Tim PHXMB MINISTER; Are you not thinking too much interms of long-range bombing f    there are other things besidethat, take the question of attacking troops on the march, inbattle, harassing them by flying colun5ns9 like cavalry, and allthat sort of thing, the kind of thing which we did at Montdidierand the French did note   You say it is effective in breaking the moral of troops...    I should have thought that that was an important part of the battle.   Is there no thinking out of that kind ofproblem of what use you can make of machines - in the battles ofthe future as well as in bombing ?GENERAL SYKES: That is done as far as we are concernedby the Forces actually in close co-operation with the armies, butthe difficulty is that the French do It spas modically.TEK PRIME MINISTER:   That is unsatisfactory,MB, HUGHES:   What Is the strength of the French AirForce ?GR113RAL SYIES;    I have-not the figures but it is verymuch larger than ours.MR. MA33BY:

MR. MASSI3Y:   Is there any difficulty in so our log suitable-&apos;,,men for the Air service ?-   GRKPSBAi 3YKES:    In sufficient numbers, yes.MR, HUGHES:   What is the policy of the Government inregard to the war in so far as man-power Is concerned ? Supposingthe war is going to last another two years and supposing our losses continue   on the scale of 1916 and 191?.   We are not fightingthis war for the oaks of fighting hut for the sake of heating the.Oerroans *   We want to find ourselves in a position to reap the fruits of victory, if we gain victory, and to stave off the resultsof defeat if we are defeated, or if there is a stalemate.    If weuse our man-power at the rate we are doing whether we win or losswe are &quot;done&quot;,   $hat is the way I put it,   I say you are usingup the flower of your nation. In two years at the rate you havebeen going on your chances as a competitor with America or withGermany will be very snail; so I say it amounts to this : wehave heard this afternoon of the potentialities of this wonderfulDepartment of the Air,   When the war started, of course, it was a negligible force.   Then it was developed and now it has become a great Arm,   Mow we go into battle with infantry and you do wellas&apos; you know if you corae out with say 80,000 casualties, &apos;$heAustralians have lost SO,000 in a week in some of the offensivesthat have taken place,-  You go into battle - I am talking aboutman-power now not money - you lose SO,000 or you lose 100,000;your losses for March end April were 160,000 a month or something like that.   You keep on like that and in two years where will yoube ?   fj?he Govern sent should consider how far it is possible to conserve its man-power because our object is not merely to win.this war at all hazards by the sacrifice of the last man we have got, because if we win, we lose, we are barren.    It is what wehave to do afterwards,   England h;:.s to live..   So I say. what Mr.Churchill says, goes right down to bedrock,   supposing you have 115,000 as your capital, monthly subscriptions 8,000 number of machinesavailable

available for active service, so much.    If it be necessary toincrease the capital in order to increase the fighting force,increase it.    That is what I say.    It is no good talking aboutinfantry or anything else when you have here a striking force which at any rate is as useful and as likely to bring you victoryas anything else,  and does it at an infinitely lower price of blood than anything else.   There-fore you should consider what isthe policy of the Government in regard to the war so that when this war is over in two years the policy will not be dictated byAmerica or anybody else, by our raan-power having- gone, and our having to accept the crumbs from the&apos;-table, or in any case, ifwe are a great Power then-----------THE PRIME MINISTER:    What is the hearing of this on theAir, Mr. Hughes ?MR. HUGHE3j   We have met here not merely to get informationbut to make use of it.    X say what I would like to know as a repre-serstative of one of the Dominions is;    What is the Policy of theBritish Government in regard to the Air Force,  the use of its)?san-powers  and of its resources generally ?   What line are wegoing along ?   I have set it out quite clearly and now I thinkperhaps we may either discuss it, or you, Mr. Prime Minister,might state it.SIR WILLIAM WEIR:   The.answer to that is that we are ex-panding the Air Force on the strategical lines -of policy laiddown by General gykea, while at the same time-we are taking everystep possible to increase the efficiency of its utilisation.MR. CHURCHILL:    I think the point Mr. Hughes raises is really a fundamental point which ought to be faced.   It is comingup not only in this field but in every field as to the conserva-tion of our man-power and&apos;- as to the use of our man-power in con-junction with scientific apparatus instead of merely foot soldiersto be shot down.   Although you. have got to find a minimum numberof men to cover the fronts to-day ought .we not to put the balanceof our effort as far as possible into this scientific machine.Aeroplanes / &apos;.are

 are not the only ones. Tanks are another great development. We are actually making far more Tanks than we have men to man them. Why do our men go on foot and get shot down in tens of thousands and the Tanks should be handed to the Americans? I say that is altogether a wrong development at the present time. The Americans are fresh, it is for them to put in the infantry at the end of this year and during next year. The use of our man-power in connection with the highest forms of scientific apparatus should certainly be a principle of our policy.

 THE PRIME MINISTER: You know the answer of the Germans to all that. They said the British depended for more on appliances than they ought; in the end it is the man that wins. The British perfected their equipment: we (the Germans) perfected our men, and that is more or less what is happening now. The Germans say the British equipment may be superior to ours but their men are inferior to ours -- not inferior in regard to quality of the men but in regard to their training. The result, there is no doubt, is that the Germans have a more trained army than we have -- speaking freely. General Radcliffe will bear out what I say.

 GENERAL RADCLIFFE: Yes.

 THE PRIME MINISTER: I think General Sykes said the fundamental principles are the same from generation to generation. It is the highly trained disciplined, well led of course, but especially highly trained skilled man who will win in the end, given fairly good appliances.



1 think it would&apos; be a pity If we were to trust too much tosuperior appliances to the neglect of the one great lesson of thisyear **-* that the highly trained man la the one who wins.GEIBIUL SMUTS:    I think there is no doubt about if that thatis the lesson of March.- MR. MlFOUR:   Observe the machine Is not a substitute foritraining; it is a substitute for numbers; the man who works the machine is more highly trained - your flying man is a much better trained man than your infantry man? your Tank man betterthan the infantry.   Therefore, I do not think the antithesis you have laid before us nuite meets the argument.mn PRIME&apos; MlfllSMHSR:    I do not say the Germans are right.s They have only gone in with a perfectly simple machine, which isnot a new one; they have gone in with a machine gun. It is notequal to the Lewis gun, that Is what I have been told. The Germanssay, that 4&amp; does not matter, it is $nits good enough, but whatmatters Is that you should train the man - in the use of the machine.We were all afraid ho was going to have about 5,000 Tanks, and allsorts of things to counter our own, but he has just got the maohinehe had in 1914.&apos; He&apos; spent the months just before the 81 st March intraining his men in the use of the rifle and generally in manoeuvringand all the t&amp;ings that you do when you are training a man for war,and it is with a simple machine he has beaten all our appliances, andif we begin to think that merely by perfecting our machinery we are going to win, then I think it is most Important that we should notbe taken away from the one great lesson of this year.ME. HUGHES:   What is that one great lesson ? We have beenbeaten at every point      that is one lesson.TKK PRIME MINISTER;    No, that is a fact.   We were beatenby superior training.   As a matter of fact, wo were not beaten bysuperior numbers.   I have made enquiries and find that we were beaten !by a thin screen of men who were highly trained. They employed the- tactics, as I have previously pointed out, that the Boers had in Africa-except

except they had the rifle and the Germane had machine guns, and theFrench practically-ran away from these very very highly trained men, and the enemy * a casualties were? insignificant.   They lone lessbecause they are highly trained, and that is another lesson of thewar,- that where you get highly trained men they lose far less thanyour mere rabble of half-trained men who run away.MR. HIXXHES:    I have made myself ill-understood, I thinic; I did not raise that point at all; highly trained men will alwaysbeat raw levies.   That has been true from the time of the Remanlegions to to-day-    The point In we have not enough men to go on and win on the same lines that we have been going on, and on theday of victory be able still to - remain a great nation.MR. CHURCHILL:    Here are 120,OO0-,000 Americana to come intothe war, if there is to be a contribution of numbers it is up tothem to do it, and we ourselves, should specialise on the scientificside.MR, CHAMBERLAIN:    Is not this one of the most important ques-tionn which the prime Minister asked the other Prime Ministers todiscuss with him as a preliminary to anything that might be said in the War Cabinet ?   X am not a Member of that Conference, but 1thought this was the kind of question you were going to discuss with the Prime Mini oterMB. HUGHES:   Kerensky said an important thing last night to mewhich I think you ought to -know.   He said a lot he had said to you,but speaking about -the Japanese he was very clear and very -firm onthis point, that in no circumstances at all would it be acceptable-to the people he represented, or to the Russian nation,  if theAllied force were commanded by a Japanese.   On that he was perfectly clear.    It did not matter where this Allied force got to, and it did not matter whether there were 500 japanese to 1 American or not,but if the Commander-in-Chief were Japanese,  then the psychological effect would be such that he himself thought it would be fatal bofar as Russia was concerned.MR. BOHAB LAW:    If that is right it kills the whole thing. ,

liftMR9 HUGH88: If the Japanese would agree that an Americanshould he called the Generalissimo, although having no controlover the Japanese, that would he satisfactory.IiQRP HILHKR;   He had altered his view hy 1 a.m.   I got himto admit that if the Japanese were a very great majority inthe Expeditionary force, you coup not refuse to let the Oomm&amp;nderlie Japanese, provided the whole force, no to speak, wae accompaniedhy a political mission composed of Allies who would not commandtroops at all hut would deal with the political questions arisingis. oonsequenoe of the expedition.&apos;2, Whitehall Gardens, s.W.June 29th, 1910,
