Our Attitude towards the ex-Kaiser.The Prime Minister : I want to get a decision from the Imperial War Cabinet onthe question of the prosecution of the ex-Kaiser. We must come to a conclusion inview of the fact that M. Clemenceau is coming over here at the end of this week. TheFrench jurists have advised the prosecution of the ex-Kaiser by the Allies, and Iunderstand the French are strongly in favour of it. We decided to refer the matter to the Law Officers of the Crown, and I invited them to be present here to-day toexpress their views. They appointed a very powerful Committee as powerful a bodyof legal advisers as you can call together to advise on this and other matters, and theyhave been considering this question for some time. I understand that they have come to a conclusion which is a perfectly unanimous one, and I think the Attorney-General had better explain to the Cabinet what the position is.Sir Frederick Smith: Prime Minister, Lord Curzon conveyed to the Law Officersof the Crown some days ago the desire of the Cabinet that they should give theiropinion on this matter. The Law Officers pointed out the extreme importance, delicacy,and difficulty of the matter submitted, to them, and the fact that they themselves were very much engaged in other matters, and asked what period of time could reasonably beallowed them to produce a written opinion adequate to the gravity of the topic. lord curzon at that time took the view that they might be allowed ten days. Well, of theseten days, only, I think, four or five have elapsed, and therefore the Cabinet will excuseany imperfection of form in the statement I am about to make. We have, however,arrived at a clear conclusion, otherwise we should have informed the Cabinet that wewore not yet m a position to give definite and final advice. The matters involved hereare partly legal and p^r^lvmatters of policy. So far as they are matters of policy, theCabinet will, of course, merely&quot; i^eat our views as the opinions of colleagues who are not entitled to,&apos; and who are not claiming,&apos; any&quot;^Special weight The main question herewhich we, in common with our Allies,have to consider.-is whether the taking of proceedings against, or any punitive treatment in relation to, the KaWershould become the declared policy of the Government. The Law Officers of the Crown answ7^ this&quot;question in the affirmative. They point out to the Cabinet that the choice now to. betaken is between two diametrically opposed courses, and that no half-way house ispossible in the matter. The first is a decision in favour of complete impunity, animpunity which will be described as luxurious and wealthy ; the second is in favour of punishment. We wish the Cabinet to consider very carefully how it will be possiblefor them to justify a decision in favour of impunity. The ex-Kaiser&apos;s personal responsibility and supreme authority in Germany have been constantly asserted by himself, and his assertions are fully warranted by the constitution of GermanyaAccepting, as we must, this view, we are bound to t ake notice of the conclusion which follows : namely, that the ex-Kaiser is primarily and personally responsible for the death of millions of young men ; for the destruction in four years of 200 times as muchmaterial wealth asj Napoleon destroyed in twenty years; and he is responsible and this is not the least grave part of the indictment for the most daring and dangerous challenge to the fundamental principles of public law which that indispensablecharter of international right has sustained since its foundations were laid centuriesago by Grotius. These things are very easy to understand, and ordinary people all overthe world understand them very well. How then, I ask, are we to justify impunity ?Under what pretext, and with what degree of consistence, are we to try smaller criminals ?Is it still proposed it has been, repeatedly threatened by the responsible representativesof every Allied country to try, in appropriate cases, submarine commanders and tobring to justice the governors of prisons ? Is it proposed to indict the murderers ofCaptain Fryatt ? In my view you must answer all these questions in the affirmative.I am at least sure that the democracies of the wrorld will take that view, and among them I have no doubt that the American people will be numbered. How can you do this if, to use the title claimed by himself, and in itself illustrative of my argument,&quot;the All Highest &quot; is given impunity ? Must we not, at the moment of our triumph,avoid the sarcasm : Dat veniam corvis, vexat censura columbas f In order to illustrate the point which is in my mind I will read to the Imperial War Cabinet avery short extract, which represents our view with admirable eloquence, from Burke&apos;sspeech in the trial of Warren Hastings : &quot; We have not brought before you an obscure offender, who, when hisinsignificance and weakness are weighed against the power of the prosecution,gives even to public justice something of the appearance of oppression; no, my
Lords, we have brought before you the first man of India in rank, authority, andstation. We have brought before you the chief of the tribe, the head of the whole body of eastern offenders ; a captain-general of iniquity, under whom all the fraud,,all the peculation, all the tyranny in India are embodied, disciplined, arrayed, and paid. This, is the person, my Lords, that we bring before you. We have brought before you such a person, that, if you strike at him with the firm and decided arm ofjustice, you will not have need of a great many more examples. You strike atthe whole corps if you strike at the head.&quot;Prime Minister, in my judgment, if this man escapes, common people will say^everywhere that he has escaped because he is an Emperor. In my judgment they willbe right. They will say that august influence has been exerted to save him. It is not desirable that such things should be said, especially in these days. It is necessary forall time to teach the lesson that failure is not the only risk which a man possessing atthe moment in any country despotic powers, and taking the awful decision betweenpeace and war, has to fear. If ever again that decision should be suspended in nicelybalanced equipoise, at the disposition of an individual, let the ruler who decides uponwar know that he is gambling, amongst other hazards, with his own personal safety.For these reasons we think the ex-Kaiser should be punished.    If this view is accepted, the question arises : How is his person to be secured ?   And the question hasbeen asked, and will be asked, whether or not he can be extradited.  Now, Sir, the french have apparently expressed the view that he can.   My own clear opinion is that that view is wrong, and I think my colleague, the Solicitor-General, is, on the whole, of thesame opinion; but it is not necessary to argue that question, because we do not ^r^nnseto involve ourselves in a doubtful technical argument when we ^ave more powerfulweapons at our disposal.    Infinite vistas of litigious deputations are opened by an argument whether according to the law of Hpllajrf ^ can be extradited or not.    Andif, contrary to my opinion, he could bs extradited, he could only be charged for thevery offence (possibly a ^ffiifed one) which had been successfully alleged as the ground. in law j^-niPe^fadition.    I think it is unnecessary to ask whether in law we canextredite him, because it seems to me that Holland must, in effect, give him up.    TheLeague of Nations, or the Conference of the Allies which will precede the formation ofthe League of Nations, has, or will have, powerful arguments to address to Holland,and the.internal condition of Holland seems to me to be such that it would be verydifficult for her to reject arguments of the kind indicated.   This is not a point of law,but my own conclusion is that the difficulty of obtaining control of the person of theex-Kaiser from Holland will not be an insuperable one, though I should naturally deferto the views of the Foreign Office upon such a point.    It may, perhaps, be assumed that the difficulty will not arise which would be occasioned in this connection by theex-Kaiser&apos;s return to Germany.    The taking of unnecessary risks has not up to thepresent been a distinguishing feature of his career.    Different considerations might arise if the reconstitution of Germany should really bring with it an honest desire todeal with the Kaiser themselves.The few observations, therefore, which I have still to make will be made upon theassumption that it will be possible to obtain control of his person. I have made it clearthat in our judgment control should not be sought through the machinery of extradition.Supposing control of his person has been obtained, how is he to be dealt with ? Thereare two alternative courses. In the first place, he might be treated by the Allies asNapoleon was treated, that is to say, by a high assertion of responsibility on the partof the conquering nations. The Allies might say &quot; We are prepared, before the bar of history, to take upon ourselves the responsibility for saying that this man has been guilty of high crimes and misdemeanours, that he has broken the peace of the world,and that he ought either to be exiled or otherwise punished in his own person.&quot; that course may be recommended by powerful argument, and I do not myself exclude it,Prune Minister. I do not say more of it at this stage than this, that by its adoptionwe should avoid the risks of infinite delays and of a long drawn-out impeachment. Weshould carry with us the sanction and support of the overwhelming mass of civilisation,and we are bold enough to feel that we have nothing to fear from the judgment of thefuture. It is even possible as Austria and Germany will be reconstituted-that therewill be few dissentients in the governing classes of these countries.The second alternative is that he should be tried by a Court which must evidentlybe international in its composition. There are obvious advantages in this method uponthe moral side,&apos;if this method of dealing with the situation be carried to a logicalconclusion.   It is, of course, very desirable that we should be able to say that this man
received fair-play, and that he has had a fair trial, but grave difficulties beset this-course in its complete application. In this connection, how is the Court to be constituted ? Are neutrals to be members of the Court ? Are Germans to be members-of the Court ?The only advantage of judicial procedure over the other alternative a highexercise of executive and conquering force submitting itself to the judgment of history lies in the fact that for all time it may claim the sanction of legal forms andthe protection in favour of the prisoner of a tribunal whose impartiality can beestablished in the face of any challenge. This advantage, it must be observed, largelydisappears if the fairness of the tribunal can be plausibly impeached. The Law officers are not, indeed, of opinion that before a tribunal which consisted in part even of&quot;.Germans, as Germany appears to be developing to-day, an indictment would necessarilyfail. But it is unwise to ignore the difficulties. German and neutral representation:would undoubtedly be claimed by the Kaiser. We can only qualify the consequent riskby saying that the German representatives would certainly be less German than theywere, and the neutral representatives less neutral. ;On the whole, if a Court be constituted, I confess that I myself incline on thewhole to the view that the members of the Court should consist only of citizens of theAllied countries. Grave judges should be appointed, but we should, as it seems to meat [resent, take the risk of saying that in this quarrel we, the Allies, taking our standupon the universally admitted principles of the moral law, take our own standards of&quot;right and commit the trial of them to our own tribunals.I cannot, because time is short, develop the matter as I should like now, andtherefore I merely place it on record that I am well, aware that the opposite view mayhe \supported.by formidable arguments.Tne great qliestion which I shall probably be asked and here again inter-Allieddiscussion will be nee s&amp;Ty ^s : For what offences, in your view (assuming the adoptionof judicial proceedings), slXll&amp; tne ex-Kaiser be made justiciable ? The first charge whichwill occur to many persons is one which TaSuL in limine the question of his responsibilityfor the origin of the war. Well, Sir, I can only say, wtfaWJv^JMlg a decision, that the trial of such a charge would involve infinite disputation. We do nofWfsn^tobecome...involved in a trial like that of Warren Hastings in its infinite duration. We cto not wish to be confronted by a meticulous examination of the history of European politicsfor the past twenty years. It is very easy to see that no German advocate of theex-Kaiser would find it difficult to enlarge the area of discussion, carrying it to whatwould be described in Germany as the &quot; ringing round &quot; system, and discursively spreadingfrom the question of the origin of the war to a close discussion of the military significance of the Russian . strategic railways. The view which I have at present is that it wouldnot be wise to add so general a charge, but this provisional view might easily be modifiedif new and decisive documents were produced, like those recently disclosed by theBavarian Minister, who was in Berlin in August 1914. Such revelations are very likelyto be made.The second charge is extremely clear, and it is, in my judgment, a decisive one. Acount should certainly be inserted in the indictment charging the Kaiser with responsi-bility for the invasion of Belgium in breach of international law, and for all the consequent criminal acts which took place. That is an absolutely clear issue, and upon itI do not think that any honest tribunal could hesitate. It is even possible, obscure asthe present position in Germany is. that a partly German tribunal convened under existing circumstances in Germany would reach the same conclusion.The next charge, in my judgment, which should be brought against him is that he-is responsible in the matter of unrestricted submarine warfare. It may be necessaryto associate other defendants in this charge. But it will, in my judgment, be absoulutely impossible for us to charge or punish any subordinate if the ex-Kaiserescapes with impunity all responsibility for the submarine warfare. I wish to pressmost strongly upon my colleagues certain fundamental considerations in regard to-submarine warfare, as it has been carried on since the incident of the &quot; Lusitania.&quot;,Since then thousands of women and children, in our clear and frequently expressedview, have been brutally murdered. I am dealing with the case where a ship istorpedoed carrying no munitions of war, but which it is known must&apos;or may be. carrying- women and children, and where it is equally known that such passengers hadno possible means of escape, and I do not in this connection deal with the vile cases ofassassination when helpless boats, vainly attempting to escape, have been fired on and d&apos; stroyed. Excluding the last class of cases, it is our view, and the view of the wholecivilised world, that those acts amount to murder.   It is surely vital that if ever there^
is another war, whether in ten or fiteen years, or however distant it may, be, those responsible on both sides for the conduct of that war should be made to feel thatunrestricted submarine warfare has been so branded with the punitive censure of thewhole civilised world that it has definitely passed into the category of internationalcrime. &quot; If I do it and fail,&apos;&apos; the Tirpitz of the next war must say, &quot; I, too, shall pay for it in my own person.&quot; Bow can we best secure that no one in future will dream ofresorting to submarine warfare of this kind ? You can best secure it by letting thewhole world know that, by the unanimous consent of the whole of that part of thecivilised world which has conquered in this war, the man responsible for those acts is responsible in his own person for that which he has done. To us of all people it is notpossible to exaggerate the weight and force of these considerations. Nothing morevitally concerns these islands than that it should be recognised that these acts arecrimes. The commission of such crimes, and their possible future development, menaceus more directly than any other nation in the world.The above are suggestions, and not necessarily exhaustive suggestions, in regardto the offences for which the Kaiser should be tried. There are other individual cases with which I do not think it necessary to trouble the Cabinet at this stage.It is true that the Prime Minister authorised, me to form a Committee to report upon these matters, but the Law pfficers obviously cannot place their responsibilityfor advising the Government in legal matters in the hands of anybody else, andthey have arrived at their conclusions independently of the conclusions of thisCommittee, and, indeed, before they were informed of them. I think I ought to pointout who are the members who compose this Committee, which is the Sub-Committeeon Law of the Main Committee.   They are as follows : Professor J. H. Morgan (Chairman).Sir John Macdonnell (Chairman of the Main Comm^^ee^mSir Frederick Pollock. ^,^^m-*......&apos;Sir Alfred Hopkinson, K*Q**M&apos;&quot;&apos;*&quot;&apos;&quot;^&apos;Mr. V. A ..Efissefj; KG.&apos; &quot; jr Pearce Higgins.Mr. Justice Peterson.Mr. C. F. Gill, K.C.Mr. J. F. More (of the War Office).Of these, Sir John Macdonnell, Mr. Justice Peterson, and Mr. Gill, are not members of the Sub-Committee on Law, but were called in for the special purpose of discussing the new issue as regards the ex-Kaiser.The Prime Minister : That is a very strong Committee.Sir Frederick Smith:. I think the Lord Chief Justice will agree that it wouldnot be possible in this country to form a stronger Committee for the purpose of arriving at a sound conclusion upon such matters. It is a source of satisfaction tothe Law Officers that this Committee has unanimously and independently of themreached the conclusion that the ex-Kaiser ought to be punished, either by way of trialor as Napoleon was punished. The Committee inclines to the first of those courses,namely, that he should be tried. I am not at present wholly convinced upon thispoint, and, in the written opinion which the Solicitor-General and myself contemplate,we propose to discuss this matter in greater detail. Probably 1 have said enough tomake the Cabinet aware of the views held hy the Law Officers; I could, and would,have said much more if I were not concerned to be economical of your time. As chiefLaw Officer of the Crown I say quite plainly that I should feel the greatest difficulty in being responsible in any way for the trial of subordinate criminals if the ex-Kaiser is allowed to escape. ,The Prime Minister: Have you anything to add, Solicitor-General ?Sir Gordon Hewart: No, Sir, I agree with the Attorney-General.The Prime Minister : Unless someone has anything to say upon it I suggest thatwe accept the report of the Law Officers of the Crown. The case has been very-ably stated by the Attorney-General, and his views are supported by the strongestlegal body that you can possibly summon together in a matter of this kind in thiscountry.   Does anyone dissent ?Mr. Barnes : We are not committing ourselves to the method, are we ?[543-11] C
The Prime Minister: No, we shall get a reasoned opinion upon that point. Ishould like to get it, if I may say so, in time for M. Clemenceau&apos;s arrival here.He will be here on Sunday, if we could get it before then it would be a great advantage.Sir Frederick Smith: We will do our best.The Prime Minister: M. Clemenceau will have the views of the French jurists asto the best method of procedure. Unfortunately they themselves will not be over here, otherwise it would be of great advantage if you could meet them and discuss thequestion.Sir Frederick Smith : Some of us have engagements in the provinces, but we will do our best to let you have it.Lord Reading : Will you make any public statement in regard to this until you have had consultation with the Allied Governments ?The Prime Minister: I think we must leave that for consideration.Lord Reading : The only thing that occurs to me is that it might create difficulty with America; that is all.The Prime Minister: America must paddle her own canoe. We have responsi-bilities in this matter greater than hers. Our sufferings have been very muchgreater.Sir Robert Borden: I should like to make one observation ; I have been muchj^OTessed by what the Attorney-General said as to the undesirability of a longdrawn-out trial. * Ife may be, if judgment of some kind is to be passed upon theex-Kaiser that it cd^i^ ^e done more effectively by a resolution at the PeaceConference than by any tnSi!&apos;v&apos;&apos;l&apos;^^W^quite sure that that would not be thebest way. ^&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;*&quot;&quot;&quot;-&apos;Sir Frederick Smith : That is the point I tried to make that i 128hnS 40thatview.The Prime Minister: That would require very careful examination with our allies. I should like to await the report of the Law Officers, and also to know whetherthis Committee has gone into that point.Sir Frederick Smith : They have discussed it in great detail.The Prime Minister: We will wait until we get those reports until we make up our own minds.Sir Robert Borden : I entirely agree.Sir Frederick Smith : I will have the report of the Committee printed as soon aswe have our own report done.Mr. Bonar Law: Then I understand the decision of the Imperial War Cabinet isthat, so far as we haVe the power, we intend to punish the ex-Kaiser. &quot;The Prime Minister: As the person responsible for these offences against inter-national law and against humanity.Sir Frederick Smith : As I shall myself be going to my constituency very soon, isone at liberty to say anything in that strain ?The Prime Minister: I propose to say something to-morrow. (To the Chief of theImperial General Staff) : Have you any objection ?General Wilson: No, Sir.Co-ordination of Measures for Revictualling Allied, Enemy, and Neutral Countries.The Prime Minister: I want someone on behalf of the War Cabinet to take inhand the co-ordination of the arrangements for the relief and revictualling of Allied,enemy, and neutral countries; to look after our interests in the Allied Maritime transport council; and to preside at the meetings of that body. We have been pressingLord Reading to take it in hand. He has from time to time helped us in these matters,and as the President of the United States is coming over to Europe in the course of the
^next few days, there does not seem any point in Lord Reading returning to Washington.As the Government of the United States will be here, it is very urgent that we shouldhave someone in charge of this question, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer and Ihave urged Lord Reading to take it in hand, and, if the Imperial War Cabinet agree,I propose a minute to that effect should be put through. Lord Reading has accepted this responsibility, but under very considerable pressure.Lord Reading : I think I ought to say I have undertaken it because you pressedme hard to do so, though I am not at all sure that I shall be able to carry it through.It means a good deal of work, but at any rate I am willing to try it, and if I find I amunable to do it, 1 must give it up.The Prime Minister : I ought to say that Lord Robert Cecil was the Chairman ofthe Inter-Allied Maritime Transport Council before his resignation, and he urged me toask Lord Reading to take it in hand, and I pressed Lord Reading to do so, as also did the Chancellor of the Exchequer.Lord Reading: It means a great deal more than that at the present moment.As I understand it, I shall have to act as a sort of High Commissioner representingthe British Government in these matters. The question must include finance and rawmaterials and the feeding of the enemy.The Prime Minister: The question of the feeding of the enemy is an absolutelynew element, and we feel we are not represented in that respect.(At this point the discussion was discontinued, but was resumed^ Zaier. .;^;vtfL&quot;,...\ 1 iy:&apos;L&apos;fj.^&amp;&apos;^\&quot;-^,.&apos;-t&apos;&apos;&apos;l/H triemeeting, as described below.)Lord Reading: I think we are lik^ ^&quot;experience very great difficulty in regardto these matters, and X^iuxf the question of these Inter-Allied Councils is likely to^&quot;&quot;^y- &quot;^p^iS&quot;^ &quot;maifter of policy.   That is the reason why I wish to bring it before the-CaLmet... (Lord Gurzon entered at this point, and the Prime Minister gave him a brief account of the discussion on our attitude towards the ex-Kaiser.)*Lord Reading : What I. was about to say is that Mr. Hoover has already arrived&quot;in this country and has/proceeded to France, but is coming back probably at the end ofthis week, when a really serious decision will have to be arrived at. The Americandelegates have come, I think, with the idea of not continuing the Inter-Allied Councilsunless they are compelled to do so. I think the idea they have in mind is that america wants to be free, and the reason I am pointing it out is that we are faced,quite early in these discussions, with this difficult point, on which we must come to a conclusion. France, Italy, and ourselves have arrived at the conclusion which was discussed here at the Cabinet-that the German delegates ought to be invited to come here, and that we should not go to Spa to meet them, and that there should be no discussion at Spa. (To the Prime Minister) ; You remember the view was taken bythe Cabinet that that was a matter which ought to be discussed here, and that theywere to come here on questions of food and assistance, and you telegraphed toM. Clemenceau in this sense. M. Clemenceau telegraphed that he agreed with yourview upon that. Italy says she will do what we think right. Now America is takingquite a different attitude, and Mr. Hoover, who was only here for a few hours, came tosee me and pointed out that he wanted this meeting to take place in Brussels.The Prime Minister : Why in Brussels ?Lord Reading : I think really it is because he has been associated with the. BelgianRelief, and he personally has a great fancy, not unnaturally, for taking part in a bigCommission there in which he again appears as the relieving person in regard to food.I think that is very largely the case. Mr. Hoover holds the idea that what is necessaryis that we should have some one person who should be in control of this abroad, underthe orders, of course, of the different Governments. I thought he meant himself, so I-asked him whether he was prepared to do it, supposing the various Governmentstook this view.    He said, &quot;No, he had to go to Washington.&quot;   In spite of our
discussion, and.in spite of my having pointed out to him the difficulties about Brussels,,and that London had been more or less agreed to as the meeting place, an announcementhas been made, which for the moment I will take as I see it in the press, to the effectthat Mr. Hoover has said.that he is going to start a Commission in Brussels for thepurpose of this relief. I think we have got to come bo a conclusion about this question,which is the first of a series of incidents which are bound to arise, and in which we shall find ourselves France, Italy, and ourselves taking one view and America takinganother. It will be very unfortunate if this does come about; as the result would bethat America would act independently. On the other hand, I think it is a very seriousthing to allow America, when she comes in at this moment, to dictate what the positionshall be, without discussion with us. We cannot allow her to say : &quot; This is what we intend to do, and you have to follow suit.&quot;The Prime Minister : You have seen a document, which I had forgotten for themoment, which bears this out.Lord Reading : The last thing I want to do is to bring detail before the Cabinet.But we must make up our minds as to the question of policy.The Prime Minister: On the facts, I understand that they claim that 90 per cent.,of the food is theirs.   How much of the shipping would be theirs ?Lord Reading : Most of the shipping would be ours.The Prime Minister: What percentage ? &apos;       .Lord Reading: I could not tell you at the moment, but it would probably be verymuch like what it has been in the case of the transport of American troops - 60 per cent.^ritisrfto^O per C^nt&apos; American. I believe they have a lot of ships ready to put in,Mr. Hurley told me&apos;fe^d a S00f numbe^ read^ in which *2 send food. Of courseone has to remember that ntfnfl Y^P^ important P^f. From discussions that Ihave had both with Mr. Hoover and Mr. Hurio&apos;;, liud. from 7the thmfs *hat 1 h.aveheard and seen, it seems to me that what the President is^o^f^tha^ver since our telegram to him about the &quot;Freedom of the Seas&quot; he has been trying to JS^i^a&apos;&quot;&quot;free hand, and not to be tied in any way to any of our Councils or any resolutions whichwe may pass. I think that is his object. He wants to keep perfectly free so that incase we cannot agree on any point, he can, if he thinks fit -ay i &quot; Now we must takeseparate action.&quot; He is in a position to do so with finance in his hands, and to a verylarge extent food, and although he has not all the shipping in his hands, still, America,is the next powerful to us.The Prime Minister : Can he get his troops back to America without our help ?Lord Reading : He would have great difficulty in doing so, but he could do it.The Prime Minister :  How long would it take him ?Lord Reading : I should think it would probably take three times as long.In general principle America must come in with us. If not, and they insist on-going their own way, we cannot help it.Of course, America would never break with the Allies, unless something serious-were to arise. It is not, however, a break with the Allies that I fear, but thatMr. Hoover might say : &quot;We are quite ready to deal with this thing and to deal with it ourselves. We will finance it, and we will find the food, but we want assistance in-shipping.&quot; He will further say : &quot; We carry food to enemy countries, so we oughtto have the use of enemy ships for the purpose of carrying that food to thosecountries.&quot;Mr. Bonar Law : It all comes back to this, namely, that we must work together,.You cannot have the United States acting independently.Mr. Long: The American Minister of Commerce has made a, very strong speech in which he said : &quot; What are yOu going to do ? You have been in the war for one anda half years ; England has been in the war for five years. England has put all her efforts-into the war, whilst we have been making money and accumulating wealth. Are yougoing to be selfish and pour all your, products into England to her ^ sacrifice or destruction ? &quot;   That is a very-strong speech which shows a division of opinion.Lord Reading : I do not think it is a division of opinion ; on the contrary, I thinkit is quite consistent with the Presidents view. The President takes that view, too-He takes the view that the Americans must be careful to restrain themselves and not
to make a rush, for trade. You see one is consistent with the other ; he wants to preserve independence. He does not want America to rush in and make large sums ofmoney and force up our prices.Mr. Long: The British Government has come to a whole series of decisions; Iwent through them last night, and in my judgment they will be of very little valueif the United States takes independent action.Lord Reading : The ptodnlum swings extremely rapidly in America, and^ what has happened is that from a tremendous war enthusiasm the pendulum is now swingingin exactly the opposite way, and everybody is rushing to trade. The President wants to check this enormous rush for profits. At the same time he wants to be armed,when he comes here, with independence. I am: quite sure that is part of theState policy.Mr. Bonar Law: I think it is rather more than that; the President thinks : &quot; Iam going to use our exceptional power in order to make the Allies do what I want.&quot;Lord Reading: That is exactly what I am suggesting by his independence. Hewants to say : &quot;You do not agree with me, therefore, we go our own way. As regardsfinance, food, trade, and so forth, we in America, instead of working with you, will be independent.&quot;The Prime Minister: It does not appear a very great beginning for the League ofNations, neither does the United States naval programme.Mr. Hughes: Two points occur to me, and there is a danger of confusing them, I.think. I did not gather from Lord Beading whether Mr. Hoover was acting as theresult of any directions or policy of the President, or whether he ^fjvea^lfl^onls&apos; as lord Reading suggests, with the desire to pose as the central ^fbgUEe&apos;\Lord Reading: I fee! quite sure tJ-^VWis acting in accordance with the Presidentspolicy. &quot;&quot;*$y***Mr. Hughes: It appears to me that there ought to be joint action by the Allies,including America, on this matter. In this connection I think it will be a very weakthing if we say -we want the meeting to be here in London as against a meeting in brussels, because they will say : &quot; These English want the thing in London,&quot; and youwill not only have the President against you but you will have America against you,which is more serious. If you have joint action and treat this as if it was subsidiary tothe bigger question, which is joint policy, I think you are on sound ground. I wouldtreat it as a broad general policy, and this is to be one of its phases. If you say youstand by London I think you would&apos; be making a mistake. You would probably then have America against you.   America is largely anti-English still.Lord Reading: Our meetings have hitherto taken place largely in London, andthe American delegates have attended here and there has never been any question about it.Mr. Hughes: To the extent that you need not give way on that; well, do not do so.Lord Reading : It is a matter of accommodation.Mr. Hughes: I do not think you should make that the main point of the attack.Mr. Chamberlain : It is a matter of convenience obviously.Lord Reading: The only anxiety that I feel is that we should be placed in theposition of three countries voting against America I do not want to find we threecombining against America.The Prime Minister: It is rather America combining against us in this case.Lord Reading: That is the position we should be placed in.The Prime Minister: I have no doubt that Lord Reading will handle the situation with his usual tact and judgment. I do not consider it advisable to fetter him withany special instructions, but that it is much better he should have a free hand. Ishould like to express the thanks of the Imperial War Cabinet to Lord Reading for undertaking the responsibility.[543-11] D
The Imperial War Cabinet agreed that: (a.) Lord Reading (who accepted the invitation) should take charge until his return to the United States of America, of the co-ordination of all arrange-ments for the relief and re-victualling and supplying of Allied, neutral,and enemy countries, acting in these matters as &apos;High Commissioner with full powers on behalf of the British Government. Lord Reading&apos;s authority-will extend to the co-ordination, so far as the British Government is con-cerned, of the action of all Allied bodies dealing with this question. LordBeading will be the principal British representative on the Allied maritime transport Council, and will act as chairman in London of this body. his authority will extend also to the arrangements for placing enemy merchantshipping at the disposal of the Council.(6.) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should make a communication tothis effect to our Allies as necessary.Imprisonment of John MacLean.The Prime Minister: The next question concerns the release of a man named JohnMacLean, who is a Bolshevist. He has a great deal of ability, but has used the wholeof this ability to prevent the manufacture of munitions. We had to prosecute him for inciting sedition, and he was sentenced to three years&apos; penal servitude. We lethim out after he had served only thirteen months because the workmen said that itwould ease matters. On his release he again started making seditious speeches, andhe was prosecuted once more and is now in gaol. Now exactly the same agitationhas started again.   He is Mr. Barnes&apos; political opponent, and Mr. Barnes thinks it will help him.Mr. Barnes: I do notitSWflftfflkJikgt ground. I want to say this, Prime Minister,that all the forces of opposition to the Governm&apos; PMre focussing upon John Maclean,including, not only the Bolshevists, but the Labour party?fcJffi!?.ey are threatening to do all sorts of things, and I am afraid they will put their threats into exeuuAVm c\n^ 2these days. For instance, I have heard it whispered that there is ori foot some schemefor cutting off the light on the Clyde, and Mr. George Lansbury has a meeting at theAlbert Hall on Saturday and also on Sunday, and I know that John MacLean willfigure largely in the programme there.Mr. Hughes : Demanding his release ?Mr. Barnes: Yes. I am getting resolutions every day, and I suppose every member of Parliament is getting the same thing. Meetings are being held all overthe country focussing all attention upon the release of this man. As far as Iremember the Irish objection was to the general release of all prisoners. It was thought at that time that there were a lot of these people, but there are not. Thereis not a single one in England or Wales; there are only two in Scotland, namely,John MacLean and another man named Milne.Mr. Hughes : Do you propose to let out De Valera ?Mr. Barnes: No, his case is quite separate from this case and from the case ofconscientious objectors.   He has no public opinion behind him.Mr. Long : I think you ought to have it present to your mind that if this man islet out of prison for making seditious speeches undoubtedly you will have great pressure put upon you to let out the Sinn Feiners. The Government of Ireland are agreed that it would be1 a disaster.The Prime Minister : There is this difference in regard to the release of JohnMacLean. John MacLean was imprisoned for using seditious language, but the sinn feiners were imprisoned for being engaged in active rebellion. They had organisedthat rebellion in association with the Germans. There is no doubt that preparations were in hand for a German invasion of Ireland, and the Sinn Feiners were to getrifles and guns.   That is rather a different thing to using seditious language.Lord Gurzon : If this man has been tried and convicted and imprisoned for a-.Second time, it is rather a serious thing to let him out again.Mr. Bonar Law: I was impressed by what Lord French said at the last cabinet meeting, namely, that if you released  people  here  in  England  who  had been.
-arrested on the same sort of ground as the Sinn Feiners in Ireland, you made his taskimpossible.Lord Gave: The imprisonment is under the Defence of the Realm Regulations ineach.case. From the English point of view, I wish to point out that this man, JohnMacLean, is backed by the revolutionary party. I am told that the agitation in hisfavour in Scotland is rather dying down, but that he is being supported by therevolutionists in South Wales and a few revolutionists in London. If you release himI have no doubt he will be brought to London and South Wales to make speeches, andit will be treated as a great triumph for them.Mr. Barnes &apos; The secretary of their organisation has been pushing this.The Prime Minister (to Lord Cave): You are against his release ?Lord Cave: Yes. -       ,The Prime Minister (to Lord Milner): What do you say?Lord Milner: I am against.The Prime Minister (to Sir Joseph Cook) : What do you say ?Sir J oseph Cook : I am against. /The Prime Minister (to Lord Curzon): What do you say ?Lord Gurzon : I am against.Mr. Hughes: I favour his release. This question is mixed up with politics. I&quot;have had to deal with this kind of thing in Australia over and over ao-ain and.I think it would create a bad precedent in regard to Ireland, for thjg Very good reason,that Sinn Fein is now quite distinct from Bolsh^j^^^ up at the AlbertHall, and asked for the rde^^^^^^t^ would lose 50 per cent, of the seatsthey are trying to get. ,,,EutLhis man, John MacLean, has a Scotch name, and he is a trade/TJjnohist, and 1&quot; say you will do well to let him out. His voice will be lost inthe turmoil of the election if he is outside, but if he is inside, everybody will clamourfor his release. If he is out let him say what he has to say, and you will be perfectly:safe.Sir Robert Borden: I am inclined to let him out.Sir George Foster : I think he is a bad man and a condemned criminal, and I would keep him there to the end.Lord Reading : I would let him out.   I think he is less mischievous out than in.Sir Erie Geddes : I favour his release.General Smuts : I would let him out.Mr. Long: 1 would keep him in.Mr. Bonar Law: From the point of view of Great Britain I would let him out,&quot;but I would not do so until I knew what the Irish Government thought the effect would be in Ireland.. . .Mr. Balfour: Like Mr. Bonar Law, I consider myself on the hedge in regard tothis question.Mr. Montagu : I am in favour of letting him out. You can let him out this week,but if you wait until after the meeting Mr. Barnes talked about, it would be verydifficult to do so. We shall probably have to do battle with the revolutionaries in thiscountry sooner or later, but do not let us bring it about over the issue of a miserablecreature of this kind.Mr. Bonar Law: We agree to let him out, but we must first send a telegram tothe Irish Government to see whether they regard it as dangerous.Mr. Long: I prefer to talk to the Lord Lieutenant on the telephone about it this afternoon. I know their views, but I do not believe myself that you can let him out and keep Sinn Feiners in.The Prime Minister: Then the balance of opinion, leaving out of account Mr.Bonar Law and Mr. Balfour, is in favour of letting him out.
Mr. Balfoitr: As I understand the Chancellor of the Exchequers hedge and myrhedge, it depends a great deal upon the Irish aspect of the question. If the IrishGovernment consider his release makes their position impossible, then I am for keepinghitn in ; but if the Irish Government raise no objection, then I do not mind.The Prime Minister: It is really a different case. The Sinn Feiners wereimprisoned not merely for making seditious speeches, but for being concerned in an active conspiracy for a rebellion in Ireland against British authority. One man whowas arrested had in his pocket a document showing the numbers of troops that could bebrought together when the Germans landed. Then there was another document, ifyou remember- I think we had it from De Valera referring to a rebellion in twomonths from that date.   That I put in a totally different category to John MacLean.Mr. Bonar Law: The difficulty I see is that it will probably be said that we areletting this man out as an act of grace because he is a political prisoner. What will the Irish Government say about these other political prisoners who have been put in prison, but not tried ?General Smuts : He has been imprisoned for making seditious speeches, for the goodof the country, and the case is quite different.The Prime Minister: I suggest the Colonial Secretary, who, I am sure, will be quite impartial in spite of the fact that he takes a strong line one way, should get through to Mr. Shortt, and tell him that the feeling in the Cabinet is that they wouldlike to release John MacLean, but that the Foreign Secretary, the Chancellor of theExchequer, and I, would like to release him if it did not do any harm in Ireland. Thatis my view. I do not think it is worth having an agitation about a man who does far more, harm in prison than outside.    Therefore I suggest that, as Mr. Long represents&apos;. &quot;    - .-. ..... O CD &apos; CD Xthe Cabinet&apos; m^^ffiUfe?8^- an?airsJ and as he supervises Ireland on behalf of the WarCabinet, he should oommum^&amp;*^i^]^Shortt and put this to him, and unless he(Mr. Shortt) thinks it will make matters tm&apos;^9iSiMCffi..BIi&apos;eland&apos; .then we should take this as a Cabinet decision in favour of his release. iffon&apos;&quot;^otherJiand, there aredoubts, we should have a Cabinet meeting here to-morrow, and Mr.&quot;-bonar.  aTL-JdJJjtake the chair.&apos; Mr. Long: Can I tell the Irish Government, Prime Minister, that whateverhappens over this man, the Cabinet will support them in keeping the Sinn Feiners-in order ?The Prime Minister: I think you might say that we reached this decision on thegrounds that there was a distinction between the two cases, and that John MacLean is-not in the same category as the Sinn Feiners.Mr. Barnes : Does this apply to the other man %The Prime Minister : Yes; he has practically served his time, I think.Next Meeting of the Imperial War Cabinet.Mr. Hughes : When will there be another meeting of the Imperial War Cabinet ?The Prime Minster: M. Clemenceau is coming on Sunday, and there will be oneeither on Sunday or Monday.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,November 28, 1918.o
