1. In accordance with the Conclusion mentionedin the margin, the Cabinet held a Special Meetingmainly to consider the text of Mr Lloyd George&apos;sMemorandum on Unemployment, as revised by himafter his meetings with the General purposes committee (CP.-59A (35)), and a Statement byHis Majesty&apos;s Government in reply thereto (CP--137(35)), in the form approved by the Prime Ministerand the Chancellor of the Exchequer for submission to the Cabinet.While the draft reply in CP.-1ST (35) was generally welcomed as an extremely able exposition,certain suggestions were made, some of which are summarised below(l) That the Statement should be amended so as to prodti.ee a less negativeimpression.   In particular, Section X,&quot;Conclusion&quot;, should be altered insuch manner as to bring out what theGovernment had accomplished (irrespective of Mr Lloyd George&apos;s proposals) and what it planned to accomplish in a constructive spirit.(3) ^hat, either at the beginning or atthe end of the Statement, a reference should be made to the opening words of Mr Lloyd George&apos;s Memorandum,&quot;This is a programme for thosecitizens of Great Britain who want to see something done ......&quot;, inorder to bring out the contrast betweenthe Government&apos;s achievements, which mr Lloyd George had ignored, and the lack of positive proposals of value in Mr Lloyd George&apos;s Memorandum..(?) That the &quot;captions&quot; in italics at thehead, of the various Sections shouldbe scrutinised carefully, with, aview to conveying a less negativeimpression.(4) That as the Statement represented theviews of a Government composed of three parties, it should, be amended to layrather more stress on the importance of. action by the Gevernment.
(5) That Section IX should be reconsidered,more particularly paragraph 144 (e.g.,the omission of the sentence &quot;There isno longer the same desperate need forhaste:    it is more important to avoidmistakes&quot;), and paragraphs 145 to 14?.(6) The omission of suggestions in variousparagraphs that the Parliamentarysystem could not be relied upon totake rapid action.- t?) That Section VII,  dealing with the raising of the school-leaving age,should be so amended as to avoid givingthe impression that the Government had made up its mind on this question,which is shortly to come before theCabinet from the point, of view of theGovernment&apos;s programme for the next-General Election.(S) That some reference should, be made inthe Statement to Mr Lloyd George&apos;sproposals for the re-conditioning of farm buildings.(9) That some reference should, be made tothe building programmes of His Majesty*office  of Works.In addition, a number of amendments were made,some of them intended to carry out the abovesuggestions, others more matters of drafting, e.g.,by the Lord President of the Council, the minister without Portfolio (raising some rather largequestions), the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries,the Lord. Chancellor, the Secretary of State for War(whose suggestions, in his absence, were handed tothe Chancellor of the Exchequer by the Secretary tothe Cabinet), and the Minister of Labour.   Theseeither had already been communicated to theChancellor of the Exchequer or were communicated, tohim subsequently to the Cabinet Meeting.The Cabinet ,agreed  (a) That G.P.-137 (35) should be re-drafted by the following Ministers:-The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Lord President of the Council,&apos;The Home Secretary,The Minister Without Portfolio,with full powers to settle the documentwithout further consultation with theCabinet:
vb) That the above .Committee should aim at completing the re-draftby the evening of Wednesday,July 17th, although it was&quot;recognised that, in view especially of the Naval Review, this allowed avery narrow margin of time, whiohmight have to be prolonged:(e) That the Statement should bepublished in the newspapers onthe morning of Monday next, July22nd, but that copies should becommunicated to the Press inadvance (e,g., at latest on the evening of Friday, July 19th,and earlier if possible), on theunderstanding that they would not publish \intil the date just mentioned.
