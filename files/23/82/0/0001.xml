TFE NAVAL CON-FFRENCF, 1935.A ngl o-G erma nAgreement .proposed visit to paris by minister for league   ofNations Affairs.(previous reference:Cabinet 32(35), Con-elusion 2 .)2. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs made a statement to the Cabinet on the subject ofthe exchange of Notes between Fis Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United Kingdom and the German government regarding the limitation of naval armaments(Cmd. 4930).    Fe pointed out that the Agreement was based on the proceedings  of the late Cabinet and ofthe Committee of Ministers to whom the question hadbeen referred by the Cabinet at the Meeting mentionedin the margin.    Fe and the First. Lord of the admiralty had ^bought it important to conclude an agreement which would enable us to control German programmes of naval armaments,  instead of the probable alterna-tive of an Anglo-German competition in naval arm a-ments.    In recent years many opportunities of achieving disarmament had been lost through delay inseizing the favourable moment.    It had been clear to the two Ministers that a better Agreement couldnot be obtained from Germany and that it was essentialto seize the present opportunity and secure theGerman signature to an Agreement,    &quot;verything   possiblehad been done to obtain the good will of France andItaly.   Nevertheless, the French had started a press campaing on the subject, and the French Governmenthad sent a Note which could be described as one of criticism rather than of outraged surprise,    &quot;&quot;&quot;heattitude o^ other Powers had been not unsatisfactory.Pie proposed that the Minister for league of nations affair should proceed on Friday next to Paristo meet M. Laval and to explain all th^ circumstances.The First Lord of the Admiralty gave the cabinet a statement from the Naval point of view, in whichhe said that the Naval Staff were satisfied and hadbeen anxious to bring abou* an agreement, more
especially as they rather suspected that if there hadbeen any delay the German Naval Staff would havea v.-aytried to whittle/what was proposed.   Fe gave particulars to show that the Agreement wasadvantageous to the French Navy no less than toour own.    As the existing Naval Agreements would come to an end in 19 36 it was very valuable to beable to record this Agreement with Germany, and it ought to help towards further Agreements,   ^hearrangements as to submarines were the most likelyto be criticised, but it had to be remembered thatthe London Naval ^treaty gave equality in stibmarinesand that the submarine was not the defensive replyto attacks by submarines:    in addition, the admiralty were rather less apprehensive       submarines todaythan they had been during the War.In reply to questions the Cabinet were informed by the Foreign Secretary and the First Lord that theaetual programmes  of construction were still being discussed with the German delegation.    Questionssuch as the rate at which the Germans intended tobuild up to the 35 per cent.,and of over-age andunder-age tonnage, and other technical matters,would be dealt with in these discussions.   mhe german delegation had given the British delegation tounderstand that they would spring no stivprises during these discussions.    If, after Germany had built upa Fleet on the 3-5 per cent, basis, we were to enterinto an agreement with other Powers reducing our owntonnage, the Germans would, under this Agreementhave to make a corresponding reduction.    If,  later on, we were to agree with other countries to abolishCapital Ships or Submarines, Germany would have todo the same.    It was quite cle^r, both from the
White Paper and the record of the discussions, thatif Germany should acquire colonies this agreement would none the less remain unaltered, and it was laid down that  &quot;the ratio of 35-100 is to he apermanent relationship&quot;,In connection with the question of the ratioattention *as drawn to the following passages in Sir Samuel Poare&apos;s Note to Ferr von Rihbentrop:-Paragraph 5 (c) :&quot;Germany will adhere to the ratio35 : 100 in all circumstances,e.g., the ratio will not be affectedby the construction of other Powers.If the general equilibrium of naval armaments, as normally maintained inthe past, should       violently upsetby any abnormal and exceptional con-struct ion by oth^r Powers, the GermanGovernment reserve the right to inviteFis Ma,jesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom to examine the ne&apos;r situationthus  cr eat ed.........., .&quot;Paragraph 3:&quot;With reference to sub-paragroph (c)of the explanations set  out above,I have the honour to inform you thatFis Ma .j es t y&apos; s Government in the United -Kingdom have taken note of the reserva-tion and recognise the right thereinset out,  on the understanding that the35 : 100 ratio will he maintained indefault o^ agreement to fhe contrarybetween th e tw o G ov er nm ent s ,&quot;The above, it was pointed out, rendered the ratio a fairly tight one,mhe attention of the Cabinet was also drawn tothe following passage in the leading article of&quot;The Tiroes&quot; of even date:-&quot;If Prance insists on increasing hernaval strength, then the British andGerman Governments will clearly haveto consider increases also&quot;.this point, it was suggested, was bound to be raisedby M. Laval in his  conversation with the Ministerfor league of Nations Affairs, ^ See Conclusion (c)below ,)

mtTE PROPOSEDAIR PACT&apos; .(Pr evi previous reference:Cabinet 32(35), Con-clusion 5.)Propos edVisit to paris by theMinister for league ofNationsAffairs.fx3. ^he Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that he was confronted with considerable difficulties in making progress with the proposedAir Pact:    for example, as to how Germany could bebrought into the discussion.    He had discussed thequestion on the previous day with the Secretary of st at e for Air and representatives of the Air Ministry,and the Minister for League o^ Nations Affairs.Full agreement had been reached between them, both as to what, they would like to see included in an air Pact or in an Air Limitation   Agreement and inthe matter of procedure.    It was proposed that theMinister for League    of   Nations Affairs, on theoccasion of his forthcoming visit to Paris and hisexchange of views with M. Laval, should make it his main objective to obtain an agreement as to howprogress was to be made on the Air Fact .   Fe wouldas to procedure-take some quest.ions/with him which he would  leave withm, I aval if the atmosphere appeared favourable.Admittedly, however,  it was douibtful whether hecould expect to make much progress on the present occasion,  especially in view of the French attitudetowards the Naval Agreement. ,mhe Cabinet agreed --fa) ^o approve the proposals of theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs and the Secretary o&quot;p Statefor Air   and the Minister for Leagueof Nations Affairs, as to the line to be taken by the latter on thequestion of the Air Pact during his forthcoming .vis it to Paris:(y)        take note that, the Secretary of  .State &apos;por Foreign. Affairs and theSecretary o^ State ^or Air would circulate, for consideration by theCabinet, at their next regular weekly meeting, a Joint Memorandum on thequestion, of the Air Pact and. theLimitation of Air Armaments.
DISPUTE between italy AMDABYSSINIA(PTTipiOPIA) .(previous reference:Cabinet 28(35), Con-clusion 9.)Reactions uponSomaliland.(previous reference:Cabinet 12(35),  Con-clusion 5.)4. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs raised, as a matter of immediate urgency, the questionof the dispute between Italy and Abyssinia.    Sincethe Cabinet had discussed the matter with FisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador at Rome the situation had deteriorated.very seriously.    There was no sign, ashad then been anticipated, that M. Mussolini&apos;senthusiasm was waning.    On the contrary, largeItalian forces were proceeding to the Red Sea, andItalian public opinion appeared to have accepted thesituation as inevitable.   mhe French Government,who, according to previous expectations, should inthe last resort hove supported the League in theevent of a clash, were shoeing every sign that inthat case they would, be on the side of Italy,    ^here was every prospect, therefore,  of our being placedin a most inconvenient dilemma.    Either we should,have to make a futile protest, which would irritateM, Mussolini and. perhaps drive him out of fhe league and in&quot;1&quot; o the arms  of Germany,  or we should m^ke noprotest and give the appearance of pusillanimity.In the circumstances he had been seeking for some basis  of discussion with       Mussolini.    One difficulty was to make contact with M. Mussolini.   When he had assumed office he had invited the Italian ambassador to see him, but found that he had left Iondon.In Rome Majesty&apos;s Ambassador found it difficultto make any impression on M. Mussolini.   Yet it was most important to ascertain what the Ducefs trueattitude was.The Foreign Office were opposed to Sir EricDrummondFs proposals that we should countenance -s-ofi^-p-a-rt jt-i^R-^.^ Abyssinia, which,  in spite of ouropposition, had become a Member of the league.
In searching for other alternatives, a proposal had &quot;been examined for ceding a part of British Somalilandto Italy.     Although it might he necessary to comehack to that suggestion, he was not prepared to .propose it at present.It appeared, however, that for some yearsnegotiations had been proceeding with Abyssiniawith a view to the possible cession to that country of a narrow corridor connecting it with the openanchorage of Zeila.      It seemed possible that on thebasis of that proposal M. Mussolini might be induced to talk.     No cession of territory to Italy was involved, but it would give Abyssinia an outlet tothe sea;    and side by side with this there would be some cession of territory by Abyssinia to Italy,e,g. roughly the Ogaden Country.      The previous negotiations had been on the basis that compensationfor this acquisition of territory by Abyssinia would begiven by a rectification of boundary in favour ofBritish Bomaliland and,  if possible, also similarrectifications in favour of Kenya and the Sudan.      Inthe new circumstances, however, these demands would haveto be dropped, though the rectifications of boundarymight be obtained later,  (out not of course in thecase of British Somaliland).      He had discussed thequestion with the Secretary of Stale and the permanent under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, who agreed in principle,  subject to certain conditions (some ofwhich are mentioned later).      He asked that the cabinet would empower him to approach M. Mussolini onthe basis of some such agreement.      His proposal wasthat the Minister for League of Nations affairs should proceed straight to Rome from Paris,      Therewas ample 11 cover&quot; for his visit in the Naval Disarma-ment Agreement and the Air Pact;    but, in addition,-8-
he chould have the mission of sounding M. Mussolini as toan agreement on the lines he had suggested.       His Majesty&apos;ambassador in Rome, who had been consulted, thought that thiswas the &quot;best chance of obtaining an agreement.      The Secretaryof State apologised to his colleagues for bringing forwardthis new proposal without Papers and at such short notice,but the circumstances were such that he had no alternative.The Secretary of State for the Colonies, whilesupporting the proposal, made it clear that the most importantconcession that had been contemplated in the earlier considera-tion of the matter had been the cession of territory to thesouth of British Somaliland so that British Somali tribalrights of grazing there might be guaranteed, and that a vitalpoint in any agreement would be to secure grazing rights forBritish protected tribes in territory under Italian juris-diction across the British Somaliland frontiers.    If Zeilawere given to Abyssinia and the rights of the Somali tribesmenin the territory handed to Italy were not safeguarded, he anticipated great trouble.      Moreover, it was essential thatthis should be made clear from the first in any public announcement on the subject that might eventually be made.There were certain other conditions affecting the possiblehanding over of 2eila and the corridor, which had been laid down during the previous discussions on this matter,but with which he did not trouble the Cabinet.      The effectof the agreement would be to hand over to Abyssinia 18 miles of coastline and a corridor roughly 12 miles wide by 40miles long.In the course of the discussion the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs agreed that if any arrangementwere entered into with Abyssinia it would be essential toinclude provisions to prevent facilitating the slave trade,which was still being exploited in Abyssinia.      It was pointedout that a provision to this effect had always been contem-plated.The discussion revealed that the attractions of thisproposal to M.Mussolini might prove insufficient.    the ogaden Country which it
was proposed that Abyssinia should cede to him, wasone which Italy was likely to acquire in any  eventif she entered on a military campaign.   Moreover,there would he no question of joining italian somaliland to Eritrea, as this was  inconsistent with the proposal for a corridor to he ceded byBritish Somaliland.    On the other hand, we couldstrengthen the proposals by promising support, tothe Italian demands for economic concessions inAbyss inia.Doubts were expressed as to whether theItalians  could be relied on to observe the gracingrights of the British Somali tribes.It was suggested to the Cabinet that it wasvery important, in any announcement that might bemade eventually on this subject, to make clear thatit was the sequel to long negotiations, and thatthe whole question had been studied for years ,Otherwise we might be confronted with an earlydemand by the Germans for colonies.The Cabinet were at first reluctant to take adecision involving the possible ultimate cession ofViallelHalfpart o* a British - Colony at such short notice andwithout further information and opportunity forreflection.    It was realised, however, that the onlychance of persuading M, Mussolini to desist from military operations was to take action at once.A communication would have to be sent in advance to Rome stating that the Minister for League ofNations Affairs would have an important statement to make.   Moreover, the question o* ceding the corridor to Abyssinia had been exhaustively$CWJLexplored during&quot; s^te*al years by the Departmentsprincipally concerned, an^ they were in agreement,
and all the information necessary to a decision was available.The Cabinet were impressed not only with theworld-wide importance of the issues involved inthe decision, tut with the desirability of showing to public opinion in this  country,  in the empire,and especially in South Africa (which is greatlyconcerned in a war between a European country anda coloured raje in Africa) and to the world at largethat we have made a very substantial effort to averta catastrophe.In the above circumstances the Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should be authorised to arrangefor the Minister for League of nations affair to proceed, from Paris direct to rome, where he would enter on converse-tions with m. Mussolini not only on theagreement with Germany on Limitation ofNaval Armaments and the proposed air pact, but *- Iso on the question ofAbys s inia tfb) that the Minister for Ieague of nations affair should be authorised to sound.M. Mussolini as to the possibility of arriving at some agreement wherebyAbyssinia should cede territory to Italy,-rttu  P,-* ,J*      adjoining Italian Soroaliland Ce .g., theacU* i(MHlMl^ A4*taee-**--0ga4*n) in return -for acession by the United Fingdom to Abyssinia o^the corridor at the western end o-0 Somalilandto connect Abyssinia with the port ofZeila.    Fe should, make       clear that anessential part o-p any such agreement would, be an undertaking by Italy to respect the grazing rights  of BritishSomali tribes in Ogaden,    In addition,he should be &quot;uthorised to promiseBritish support to Italy&apos;s  demands ^or economic advantages  in Abyssinia:(c) That there should be no question of6oncltiding any .agreement involving the cession of British territory except aspart of a complete settlement which wouldrule out any prospect of war:(d) That in any announcement that might eventually be made on the subject itwould, be important to make cl^ear  
(i) That the vital point in any agreement would &quot;be to secure grazing rights forBritish protected tribes in territory under Italian jurisdiction across theBritish Somaliland frontiers:(ii) That every precaution would be takento avoid facilitating the slave trade:(iii) That the proposal was one that had been studied closely for some years by theForeign Office and the Colonial Office.That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should arrange that the cabinet should receive without delay copies of anytelegrams from the Minister for League ofNations Affairs on this subject:To take note that whenever the Prime Ministerand the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should think it necessary, the Cabinet shouldbe consulted on the situation.
THE PRINCEOP WALES.5. The attention of the Cabinet was called tothe reference made to Germany in a speech by the prince of Wales at the Annual Conference of theBritish Legion on June 11th.The Cabinet were informed that the friendlyreference to Germany had proved somewhat embarrassingand had complicated relations both with Prance andGermany,  especially during the week when the Anglo-German Naval Conversations were taking place.The effect of the speech was reported to have been particularly bad in Paris.    Apart from theconstitutional aspect of the speech it was  claimed that before any such references to foreign countries were made in public the Prime Minister of Secretaryof State for Poreign Affairs should be consulted.The Cabinet left it to the Prime Minister totake any steps which he might deem advisable.
6.      The Cabinet were informed that Mr.  LloydGeorge had sent to the General Purposes Committee anamended copy of his Memorandum in which a numberof changes in the original version had been made.There was some evidence that Mr. Lloyd George wascontemplating early publication.The Prime Minister said he would summon ameeting to consider Mr, Lloyd GeorgeTs revisedMemorandum arid the draft of the Government&apos; s reply as soon as his colleagues were ready.      The draft reply would be circulated to the Cabinet.
CEYLON.Purchase ofTear GasApparatus byGovernmentNorthernRhodesia.(previous reference:-Cabinet 16 (35)Conclusion 2).7.      The Caninet had before them a Memorandum(CP. 117 (35)) by the Secretary of State for theColonies in the late Government stating that,with the approval of the Prime Minister, he had recently authorised in Northern Rhodesia the useof tear gas rather than rifle fire in certaincircumstances, and appending for their informationa Despatch from the Governor of Ceylon in which he made a proposal the exact parallel of thatrecently approved in the case of Palestine.The late Secretary of State considered that the permission asked for could reasonably be given.The Memorandum was supported by the newSecretary of State for the Colonies, and theCabinet agreed:To authorise the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies to give permission for the importation into Ceylon of a supply of tear gas and for its use,if necessary, subject to the conditionsmentioned in CP.  117 (35), para-graph 3.
