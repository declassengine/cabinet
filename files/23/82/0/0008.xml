Idispute between ITALY and: abyssinia(ethiopia) .General.II; &apos;!(PreviousMB fjpf^p enc e&apos;m Cabinet 39(35), Con-clusion 1.)l.The Cabinet resumed their discussion on thegeneral question of the dispute between Italy and abyssinia, which had been adjourned at the previous meeting in order to give the Secretary of state forForeign Affairs time to consider the matter further and to formulate fresh proposals.   They again had before them a Memorandum by the Minister for Leagueof Nations Affairs (CP.-151 (35)) on the probableprocedure at Geneva when the dispute comes beforethe Council towards the end of the month.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsbrought the following new factors since the meeting referred to in the margin to the attention of theCabinet;In Paris the French Government was showing moreinterest in the question as the Meeting of the Councilof the League of Nations approached.   He drew attention in particular to telegrams from the British ambassador in Paris (Nos... 143 and 143) reporting French insist-ence on the sanctity of the Covenant and Frenchloyalty to the League   of Nations.   These telegramsshowed the desire of France to secure the representa-tion of Italy when the Council met.   The FrenchGovernment also appeared rather keener than beforeon the proposed three-Power Conference.In Italy there were no signs of a change of attitude.    Signor Mussolini had not yet accepted,the two pre-conditions of a Conference of the threesignatories of the Abyssinian Treaty, namely,(1) that the Italian Government should be represented at Geneva, and (3) that they should, not have recourse to war with Abyssinia while the Conference was -sitting..The former condition, as the Secretary of Stateexplained later, was very important, because otherwiseItaly might succeed in keeping the League out of the
question altogether, in which case it was possiblethat neither Prance nor Italy would face up to thereal issues and there might not even be a three-PowerC conference.It seemed probable that the Council would meetearly next week.   The discussion might begin on the narrow question of a fifth member to the ConciliationCommission, but     $ all-d  ila^ wao botund to extend to the general question.The Secretary of State added that he was followingup the suggestion made at the last Meeting, that a despatch should be sent to the British Ambassador at paris for him to hand to M, Laval, and he proposedthat this Despatch should be the basis of the ambassador&apos;s talks in Paris and. of the preliminarytalks with the French at Geneva.   In this Despatchhe proposed, to deploy the whole case as to the-dangers to European peace and. security involved in anItalo-Abyssinian war, and to end on the note that thetwo Governments ought to agree a policy for avertingwar.   His aim was to avoid crude questions being putby either side to the other as to whether they wereprepared to carry out their obligations under the\ Covenant,   The underlying assumption, would be thatI\ both Powers realised their obligations and were therefore jointly interested to find a way out of\the difficulty.   He felt that it was necessary togive the Minister for League of Nations Affairs very wide authority to put all possible pressure on theDrench to join us in inducing Signer Mussolini tomodify his present attitude.The Cabinet were informed that the Little Ententewere putting pressure on the French in the samedir ect ion as our s e Ives .
If the Italians should refuse to be represented at Geneva or should withdraw owing to the extensionof the discussions beyond the Wal-Wal incident, it was thought that the Council would be bound, nevertheless,to consider the Abyssinian appeal.The view was expressed, and met with a good dealof support, that we should be on our guard againstproposals for a settlement which was not fair toAbyssinia, and that we should aim at a settlement acceptable to Abyssinia and. within the general frame-work, of the League.mhe Cabinet were informed that such informationas was available indicated that the Italians were faced with great difficulties, especially in Eritrea,on the military side of the problem, and might not beready to begin operations even in October.    If publicopinion forced them to act prematurely they would be running great risk.   This was understood also to bethe view of the French General Staff.There was general acceptance of the view thatthere were advantages, for the present, in playingfor time, as the longer a catastrophe could be avertedthe greater would be the realisation by Italy, of thedifficulties by which she was confronted from many directions, and. the hope of a weakening on her part&apos;  though the prospects were not bright at the moment.The Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should proceed on the lines thathe had indicated in. his statement summarisedabovev   that is to say, to continue efforts to induce the French Government to combinewith ourselves in putting pressure on theItalian Government to modify their attitude:and that the Minister for League of nations affair - should be given - latitudeto pursue the same policy at the forthcoming meeting of the Council of the League ofNat ions .
b-rcpTTTF betweenMaw andKbyssinta(PPPIOPIA).Supply of Anto Abyssinia(previous reference:Cabinet 39(.35), Oon-clusion 2.)2,   The Cabinet further considered the questionof the supply of arms to Abyssinia, and certainsubsidiary matters, which had been postponed at theMeeting mentioned, in the margin, and again had beforethem the following documents:-Memoranda by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs (CP,-147 (35)and C,P.-138 (35)):A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState fof th^ Colonies (C.P.-146(35)) .The Secretary of State for Foreign -affairs informed the Cabinet that if licences were granted for the export of arms to Abyssinia within the nextfew days there would, be fierce resentment in Italyand the door would be shut irrevocably to any hopeof a settlement.    In addition, the French Governmentwould be    upset   at a unilateral decision on our part.His advice to the Cabinet was to carry out our definite:obligations under the existing Treaties and to allowtransit across British territory.   This had theadvantage of being in consonance with the french attitude.On the question of export licences he inclined to the view that, if possible, this should be dealtwith by the nations collectively, and that the matter might be raised, in the most appropriate way, orsoundings might be taken by the Minister for Leagueof Nations Affairs, when the Council met.   This wouldpostpone a decision for - ten days, after which, a finaldecision might be taken.The -attention of the Cabinet was drawn to reports in the Press that we had already issued licences forthe export of arms to Abyssinia, which had caused anoutburst in Italy.    It was felt that some public statement must be made to clear the matter up.
March, when the crisis was not yet acute, and thatat the present time all licences to both countries were held up.Difficulties were foreseen in the matter of raising the question of collective action at Geneva,owing to its probable repercussion on the italian attitude towards the larger question, and owing tothe difficulty the British representative would,encounter in giving advice to other nations.While the undesirability of British weapons being used to kill either Abyssinians or Italians was mentioned,  the Cabinet were reminded of the adverse effect throughout Black Africa of a decision to refuseto the Abyss inians the means to defend, themselves.mhe disadvantage of allowing all orders fromAbyssiniato be placed elsewhere instead of in this country,from the point of view of the capacity of our armament firms for production, was also pointed out,Doubts arose as to the precise bearing, both,from the legal and moral point of view, of the Treatyof August SI, 19 30, regulating the importation intoEthiopia of arms,, ammunition and implements of war,on the question of export.   A suggestion was made thatthe legal question might with advantage be referred for an Opinion by the Law Officers of the Crown.-5-The Cabinet were informed that the Governor ofSomaliland had now notified the Secretary of State forthe Colonies/ that he did not consider it indispensable that arms in transit through the Protectorate should be accom-panied by an escort, and that the larger the quantitiesof arms the less need, was there for an escortsThe Cabinet were informed, also that no licences for export of any arms to Italy had been given since
The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to thefollowing Question that had been put down for answer in the TTouse of Commons the. same afternoon:-&quot;Major Sir Archibald Sinclair, - To ask the President of the Board&apos;of Tradewhat restrictions have been placed by His Majestyfs Government on theexport of arms, aircraft, or other military supplies to Abyssinia which do not apply to similar&apos; exports toItaly:    and whether Fis Majesty&apos;sGovernment is taking any international action with a view to placing an embargo upon the export of such material to either or both of these countries&quot;.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That,  in view of the probable adverse effect of a decision to issue licences for exportation to Abyssinia of armsand munitions of war on. the attitudeof Italy and France, and consequentlyon the critical negotiations in whichwe were engaged for the preservation of peace (as described in Conclusion 1),we should fulfil our obligations under existing Treaties to allow transit ofarms and munitions of war across british territory, but should not for the presentissue licences for the exportation ofarms and munitions of war to eitherItaly or Abyssinia.    Our eventualattitude must be governed by theprinciple of equal treatment to both countries:(b) That the reply to the first part ofSir Archibald. Sinclair&apos;s question should be to the effect that no discrimination has been exercised asbetween Italy and. Abyssinia, and sincethe situation became critical no licenceshave been issued for export of arms to either country.   The reply to the second part of the Question should be that astatement would be made by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs within thenext few days:(c) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should draft the Statementreferred, to above at the end of (b)in the light of the Cabinet&apos;s discussions on the subject and on the lines of conclusion&apos; (a) above.   He should avoid any suggestion of collective action, or that the question would be raised formallyat the forthcoming Meeting of the Council,and should exercise caution in any reference to soundings that may be taken at Geneva: i(d) That the Secretary of State for theColonies should, have authority to.endorse the attitude of the Governor
of Somaliland as to escorts fortransit of arms and munitions beingunnecessary, but should reservesending his reply until after theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs had made the Statement inParliament referred to in (c) above.
3. The Cabinet considered the question of theprotection of British subjects in Abyssinia, raised in paragraph 5 of the Memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs (C ,P.-147 (35)).The Secretary of State for India informed theCabinet that he had agreed with the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs a Statement to be made inIndia by the Viceroy relating to the protection ofIndian subjects.   Balf the Indians in Abyss inia,including the representatives of one very wealthyand loyal firm, had refused to leave the country,and the question of their protection was therefore important.mhe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said the suggestion was to concentrate British subjects inthe Capital and to increase the guard.   The egyptian government disliked the idea of sending a guard ofSudanese from the Sudan, and it might be necessaryfor him to ask for assistance from India in thisrespect.The Cabinet approved the oroposalsin CP.-147 (35), Paragraph 5) as ageneral guide for the present as tothe protection of British subjects in Abyssinia.

The Cabinet had before them an Interim ReportqYFTEM OP G-REA.TprttAIN   RE-(0.P.-144 (35)) of the Sub-Committee of the CommitteeORIENTATION OF.  of Imperial Defence on Defence Policy and Requirements,Interim Report.on the question of the Reorientation of the Air(previous Defence System of Great Britain.    Although theRefpr^nc^:Cabinet 38 Sub-Committee were not yet in a position to make(35), Con-elusion 2.) recommendations as to the rate at which the stages ofthe scheme should, be completed, they had reached thefollowing provisional Conclusions, which theysubmitted to the Cabinet for approval:-(I) To approve in principle that the final,scheme, as laid down in paragraphs 35and 36 on. page 11 of the Report by aSub-Committee on the Re-orientationof the Air Defence System, of GreatBritain and as Illustrated in Map No.3attached, to that Report, is the schemeto be aimed at.(II) Subject to the further consideration,which is now being given to the rate at which the stages of the whole scheme should be completed, to approve thecompletion by 1940 of that part of stage 1 of the defences described inthe following parts of paragraph 49on page 13 of the Report on the Re-orientation of the Air Defence Systemof Great Britain:-(a) The partial provision of A,.A.defences in the Inner ArtilleryZone covering Greater London andconsisting of 8 A.A, batteries and searchlight companies:(b) the provision of 9 of the A..A.batteries for the Outer ArtilleryZone, of which 5 are to be located in the Thames and Medway area:(c) the provision of searchlights inthe Aircraft Fighting Zone and OuterArtillery Zone from Portsmouth, toHuntingdon, except that the depth of the portion of the AircraftFighting Zone from Portsmouth toGodalming should be limited temporarily-arily to 15 miles.   This will require36 searchlight companies.(ill) To reserve for further discussion and consideration that part of the proposalsfor Stage 1 (contained, in sub-paragraph(d) of paragraph 49) which relates tothe raising and training of additionalA.A* defence units for the second and third stages ,
(TV) To take note of the fact that theproposal (contained in sub-paragraph?e) of paragraph 49) for theexpansion of the Observer CorpsOrganisation had already beenapproved by the Committee ofImperial Defence at their Meetingheld on the 1.6th April, 1935, whenthey had under consideration a Reporton the Organisation and Expansion   ofthe Observer Corps (C.I.D. PaperNo. 206-A).(v) To take note of the contents and conclusions of the Interim Reportof the Sub-Coromittee on Air defence research (Paper No. .D.P.R.-3.) ,Some doubts were expressed as to the expediency of adopting a scheme the effectiveness of which was subject to the limitations indicatedin the Report of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee;the manning arrangements for which had not yet been worked out satisfactorily, and which would cost avery large sum of money to complete.The Cabinet were reminded, nevertheless,that the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee had approved the scheme as &quot;the proper one to be aimed at&quot;;that the Chiefs of Staff had taken part in the meetings of the Sub-Committee on Defence Policy and requirements;    and that the Sub-Committee on air defence Research had expressed the opinion thatthe recommendations should be accepted pending thepractical development and the provision of theapparatus and weapons now being explored.     TheCabinet were also reminded that they were onlybeing invited to approve.the final scheme inprinciple and not in detail as well as thecompletion by 1940 of part of Stage I of the plan&quot;subject to the further consideration which is nowbeing given to the rate at which the stages of the
whole scheme should he completed&quot;.The suggestion was made that at any moment the question might he raised in Parliament or in thePress as to what provision was being made for air defence of this nature and that from a political point of view it was important to take a decision.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that he was not at all happy as to the dates of completion for which the plans under consideration had been worked out.     All the information he had at the Foreign Office pointed to the critical datebeing earlier than was anticipated in these plans;possibly indeed as early as 1938.      He was concernedalso at information furnished to the Defence Policyand Requirements Committee by the Chief of theImperial General Staff and the Chief of the Air staff as to the rate at which German preparations werebeing carried out.The Lord President of the Council reportedthat the date at which we should aim in defensivepreparation was under consideration by the ministerial committee on Defence Policy and Requirements andhe would probably have to present a Report to theCabinet on the subject at an early date.The Cabinet agreed:-To approve the following recommendationsof the Sub-Committee on Defence Policyand Requirements -(I) To approve in principle that thefinal scheme, as laid down inparagraphs 35 and 36 on page 11of the Report by a Sub-Committeeon the Re-orientation of the air defence System of Great Britainand as illustrated in Map No.  3attached to that Report, is thescheme to be aimed at.(II) Subject to the further consideration which is now being given to therate at which the stages of the
whole scheme should he completed, to approve the completion by 1940 of that part of Stage 1 of the defences described in the following parts of paragraph 49on page 13 of the Report on theRe-orientation of the Air Defence Systemof Great Britain:-(a) The partial provision of A.A.defences in the Inner ArtilleryZone covering Greater London andconsisting of 8 A.A. batteriesand 6 searchlight companies:(b) the provision of 9 of the A.A.batteries for the Outer ArtilleryZone, of which 5 are to be located in the Thames and Medway area:(c) the provision of searchlights inthe Aircraft Fighting Zone and OuterArtillery Zone from Portsmouth toHuntingdon, except that the depth of the portion of the AircraftFighting Zone from Portsmouth toGodalming should be limited temporarily-arily to 15 miles.      This will require36 searchlight companies.
