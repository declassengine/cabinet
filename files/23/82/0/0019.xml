1. The Minister for League of Nations Affairs drew the attention of the Cabinet to Article XVI, paragraph*f the Covenant of the League of Nations, as follows&quot;The Members of the League agree,further, that they will mutuallysupport one another in the financialand economic measures which are taken under this Article, in order to minimise the loss and inconvenienceresulting from the above measuresaimed, at one of their number by thecovenant-breaking State ........&quot;A Committee had been set up at Geneva to consider theapplication of this paragraph to the present dispute,but so far we had avoided, any commitments thereunder.Certain countries, however, were being very hard hit;for example, Yugo-Slavia to SO per cent, of her trade,and Roumania to a considerable extent.   With theco-operation of the Board of Trade, to which he expressed his thanks, conversations had taken place with representatives of Yugo-Slavia, and certain proposals (with which he need not trouble the Cabinetin detail) had been made for rendering assistance.He asked, therefore, for authority in principle to sanction such proposals as the Foreign Office, Boardof Trade and Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheriesmight agree.    It had to be borne in mind that assistance to foreign countries might strengthendemands from our own nationals.   That, however, was adifferent aspect of the question.   Approval to thepresent proposal was very important to our foreignpolicy, as it would come under the very Article of theCovenant under which we were appealing to certainMediterranean countries, including Yugo-Slavia, formilitary co-operation.The President of the Board of Trade reported, thatthe Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries was affectedalmost more than his Department, as the proposed
Chickens .   The proposed facilities to Yugo-Slavia-were not large compared with our own total turn-over,hut would apparently help the Yugo-Slavs .   unfortunate-nately it might give rise to claims from elsewhere.The Minister of Agriculture and. Fisheries reportedthat the quantities involved were not large enoughto break our own market, but would, undoubtedlycreate some difficulties.   For example, there mightbe trouble with the Dominions about the admissionof eggs from Yugo-Slavia.   There was also likely tobe trouble with some of our own industries, e.g.,the fishing industry, who would urge, if these concessions were given, that markets should beobtained for their produce elsewhere.   However, hewould not oppose the proposal provided it was understood that these difficulties would arise.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidwe might be able to ask for counter-advantages inother countries.The Minister for League of Nations affairs pointed out that some countries were losingproportionately much more than others.    This wasespecially the case with Yugo-Slavia.The question was raised as to whether these concessions would he made if the countries inquestion refused military co-operation.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs suggested that this should be reserved until theoccasion arose.The Cabinet agreed  To approve the principle of some assistance being given to countries such as Yugo-Slavia, whose trade was heavily hit by the application of sanctions, and. that details should,be left to the following Ministers:-The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,The President of the Board of Trade,The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries,.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.-S-

The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reminded the Cabinet that a Debate was to take placein the Rouse of Commons on Thursday, December 5th,on Foreign Affairs, as part of the general Debate onthe A.d.dress .    In his speech he would, hs-ve to refer to china and Egypt .As regards China he proposed to observe caution,as it was impossible to say much at the moment.As regards Egypt, he was in telegraphic communicationwith the British Nigh Commissioner as to the tenor ofhis remarks .    One point which he proposed to make clear was that His Majesty&apos;s Government never puta veto on the Egyptian Constitution.The Cabinet approved the above.
GERMANY.Re-armamentof *(previous reference:Cabinet,(35), Con-e-l-u-s-ion-9-t)DEFENCE RB-QNIREMPN^S .(previous reference:Cabinet 45(35), Con-elusion 7.)3 .   The Cabinet had before them a Note by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP.- 17 (35))circulating to his colleagues three recent Despatchesfrom Pis Majesty&quot;s Ambassador at Berlin (Nos. 112 9,1160 and 1178) on the re-armament of Germany andGerman expansionist aims.    In his view these Despatchesfully justified the warnings of the Foreign Office asto Germany&apos;s tremendous preparations, and he thought they would convince the Cabinet that there was no timeto lose in the preparation and completion of our owndefensive arrangements, which were an essentialaccompaniment, and, so far as possible, preliminary toany agreement to discuss with the German Governmentthe changes which, in Blerr Hitler&apos;s words, were almost certainly necessary to prevent &quot;an explosionin the future&quot;.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said he had circulated the above Despatches as he wasimpressed with the gravity of the situation, which led him to urge the importance of pushing on with ourown Defence Programmes.   He was somewhat depressedat the slowness with which progress was being made,as examplified by the case of the production of anti-aircraft ammunition.    If that were so in amatter which had priority in a time of urgency, whatwould be the position in the general re-conditloningof the -Services?   He made a suggestion that Lord.Weir should be brought into any Committee that wasdealing with the subject as he was particularly useful in getting over the difficulties made by contractors.He could not urge on the Cabinet too strongly theimportance of pressing ahead with our own measures.Germany, even if not completely ready, might easilytake some action if satisfied that the defences ofother countries were even further behindhand..A
The Secretary of State&apos;s remarks led to a preliminary discussion on the subject, of defence requirements.    The Cabinet were informed that the(Official) Defence Requirements Committee had submitted a Report to the Prime Minister immediatelyafter the Election, and that this Report had been circulated, only to the body that had started, the inquiry, namely, the Sub-Committee of the Committeeof Imperial Defence on Defence Policy and Require-ments.   Some discussion took place as to thedesirability of circulating this highly secretReport to the Cabinet, the results of which are recorded in the Conclusions below.On the question of seeking Lord Weir&apos;s co-operatiodoubts were expressed as to whether he could he asked to afford more help than he was alreadygiving.   It was thought, however, that Lord Weirwould, be willing to sit on any Committee, and ifnecessary he might perhaps be relieved of some ofthe other voluntary work he was going for theGovernment.The Cabinet were informed that Lord tfeir hadbeen consulted informally in connection with thesection of the Report of the Defence requirements committee dealing with industrial mobilisation.The Prime Minister said that, in view of itsmagnitude and the large issues raised, the Reportof the Defence Requirements Committee was not an easy one to handle, and, having read It himself, hehad arranged to discuss procedure at the week-endwith the Secretary to the Cabinet, who had alsobeen Chairman of&apos;the Defence Requirements Committee.A suggestion was, made that,-in view of theimportance of this Report from the point of view ofGovernment Policy, the Prime Minister should
himself preside over any Committee set up.A suggestion was made that at a very early stage the Ministerial Committee that was dealing with theReport might select some items on which immediate action could he taken without waiting for the eomple-tion of its examination of the whole Report.The Cabinet were warned that the industrialactivities connected with the re-conditioning of theForces would involve very delicate questions with labour.   Even in connection with the Air ExpansionScheme such questions had arisen with Trade Unions.The Cabinet were reminded that when the public were asked to make sacrifices for re-conditioning our defence Forces and defences there would certainly bea demand for action in the direction of disarmament:for example, the conclusion of a Western Air Pactwith a view to air disarmament,    in this connection the Cabinet were informed that some time ago detailshad been works?out between the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs and the Secretary of State for Airfor proceeding with the Air Pact, but the question had been held up first by the exigencies of Frenchpolitics, and now was likely to be held up by theGermans, who did not care to discuss these mattersdxaring the present Italo-Abyssinlan dispute.   Thedanger in this was that if the Germans reached acertain point in their Air expansion they would be unable to reduce owing to its effect on theirindustrial problem.   They were already trying to sellaircraft abroad.The suggestion was made that His Majesty&apos;ambassador in Berlin might be asked to ascertain from Herr Hitler whether he was, creating his AirForce on the basis of the exaggerated figure of1,800 French aeroplanes which he had mentioned inhis discussions with Sir John Simon in Berlin earlier
in the year, or on the lower figure of 1,000 aeroplanesmentioned in the Report of a. Committee of the FrenchChamber as the present French aim.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reportedthat he was drafting a Despatch to His Majesty&apos;ambassador in Berlin suggesting that he should seeHerr Hitler and discuss these matters with him.   He wasdrawing up a series of questions which the Ambassadormight put to Herr Hitler, and would also instruct himto enquire about the Air Pact.The Cabinet agreed  (a) mo take note of the Despatches fromHis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Berlinon the re-a.rms.ment of Germany andGerman expansionist aims, circulated with C.P.-217 (35):(b) That, in view of its extreme secrecy,the Third Report of the defence requirements Committee should be circulated to the Cabinet when itwas ready for consideration, but inthe first instance its circulationshould be limited to those ministers to whom it would be referred for examination; and that the utmost caremust be taken within each GovernmentDepartment to limit its circulationand to ensure secrecy.(c) That the Prime Minister should decide on the particular machinery for theconsideration of the Report, includingthe proposal that Lord Weir should be associated either with its considerationor with the means for implementing it:(d) That the Ministers appointed by thePrime Minister to consider the report should have their attention drawn tothe various suggestions recorded above(e.g., labour aspects and the possi-bility of some immediate action):(e) That the Secretary of-State for ForeignAffairs should give consideration to theproposals made in the course of thediscussion for promoting (simultaneously with the re-conditioning of the Forces)steps in the direction of peace and disarment.

rjv ATLANT 10AIR ROUTE.f previous reference:Cabinet 4?(35), Con-conclusion 7.)5. The Cabinet had before them a Joint Memorandumby the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretaryof State for Air &apos; CP.-22.8 (35)) on the subject ofthe Atlantic Air Route, reporting that a BritishDelega-tion had been in conference at Ottawa duringthe past ten days with representatives of the Canadian,Newfoundland and Irish Free State Governments, whencertain proposals were formulated to serve as the basisof an agreement between the United Kingdom, canadian and. Irish Free State Delegations, whereby they might present a. united front in their forthcoming discussions at Washington.   These proposals had been considered atthe draft stage by the Inter-Departmental Committee on international Air Communications, and the UnitedKingdom Delegation had been authorised, with theapproval of the Secretary of State for Air, to concludean agreement on the lines suggested, on the understand-ing that it would be subject to the final approval ofthe several Governments concerned,.   A Report on theposition by the Committee was appended to the Memo-randum, and, in the light of the observations set outtherein, the two Ministers sought. Cabinet approval forthe endorsement of the provisional agreement reached at Ottawa.    It was desirable that the United kingdom delegation should be able to pursue their discussions at Washington in the knowledge that the Ottawa agreement had been approved .The Secretary of State for Air reminded, theCabinet that at the Meeting referred to in the margnhe had been asked to arrange for a technical survey of alternative bases for -aerodromes for the easternterminus of the Atlantic Air Route to be carried out at once in the Irish Free State and Northern Irelandrespectively, and that he should keep in touch with
the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland on the subject.A technical survey had now been made by representa-lives of the Air Ministry, in consultation withrepresentatives of the Irish Free State and NorthernIreland.   The gist of the conclusions reached wasthat neither of the sites hitherto contemplated,namely, Galway and Lough Poyle, was suitable.The most suitable sites were on the Shannon, in theIrish Free State, and on Lough Neagh, in NorthernIreland&apos;    but the former had the advantage ofshortening the route by 80 miles .   This answered adoubt expressed by Lord Craigavon, who, however,had made clear that he would not ask a Transatlanticairman to fly an extra unnecessary mile.In the course of a short discussion it was mentioned that the agreement between the firms wouldbe for 15 years, and that it was probable that theagreement between   Governments would be for a longerduration, though nothing had been settled.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To give their approval for the endorsement of the provisional agreement reached at Ottawa, asrecorder5 in CP.-822 (35):(b) That the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs should so informthe Delegation in Canada:(c) That the Secretary of state forAir should be authorised t.n i nfn-rmLord Craigavon of the.
