A modified, form of super-vision was also recommended pendingthe constitution of an internationalsupervisory organ which would eventuallyassume the task of watching over theexecution of the agreement:A Report by the Chiefs  of Staff Sub-Committee 7C.P.-131 (35))  on thequestion of the possible inclusion of holland in the Pact, which at presentstands referred to the Committee ofImperial FefenceiA Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs (CP.-132 (35))covering telegraphic correspondence with the Minister for League of nations affair fin Paris), reporting the FrenchGovernment&apos;s consent to enter into negotiations with the other locarno powers in respect of the proposed air pact and Air Limitation Agreement,subject to certain conditions.   TheMemorandum then set forth the Secretaryof State&apos;s suggestions as to the future course of His Majesty&apos;s Government, andattached the record of an interviewbetween the Permanent Under-Secretaryof State and Herr von Ribbentrop.After considerable discussion the Cabinet agreed(l) To accept the advice of the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs that, in viewof Mr Ed en&apos;s conversations in Paris andthe interviews between the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs and the Frenchand Russian Ambassadors,  it was imprac-ticable-to adhere to the Cabinet decisionof June 5th (Cabinet 33 (35), Conclusion 4)that the Air Pact and Air Limitation should no longer be considered to be necessarilylinked up with a general settlement,(z) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should be authorised to informthe Minister for League of Nations affairs that His.Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom, accept, the necessity for

We shouldbe on &apos;our guard against any bilateralarrangement which might arouse Germansuspicion and tend in any way toencourage Germany to break away fromthe Locarno Treaty.    Tn any eventthere was no question of concludingbilateral Pacts in advance of theproposed Air Pact:    they would onlybe adopted so far as might be desirableto render an Air Pact, effective,  andpossibly they would amount to lessin practice than was apt to be assumed.^4) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should, authorisethe Minister for League of nations affair to hand to M. Laval thefollowing questions,  on which its e em e d to Fis Ma j es t y1 s G o v er ran entdesirable that the five Powers should,preferably through diplomatic channels,define their views and, if possible,reach agreement before work could usefully be begun upon a common drafteither of the Air Pact or of theLimitation Agreement, viz,:-Qeneral.(a) Is there to be one instrumentembodying Air Pact, LimitationAgreement and prohibition ofindiscriminate bombing, or are there to be separate Instruments?Air Pact.(b) Which of the proposed signatoriesare to give guarantees, and whichare to receive them?(c) What are the circumstances inwhich the guarantees will operate?

And if anyof the parties is not to enjoyparity, what is to be the relation of its strength to thatof the other parties?(i) What is to be included in the term &quot;Metropolitan first-lines trength&quot;?(5) That the Minister for league of nations affair should be authorised to informM. Laval that we are immediately sendingover to Paris the answers of PisMajesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedFingdom to the questions set forth in Conclusion (4) above, and that weshould be glad to receive the Frenchcomments upon them as soon as possible.(6) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should circulate to the cabinet a new draft (revised in accordance withthe Cabinet discussion) of the views ofFis Majesty&apos;s Government3ef forth in Paragraph 7 of cp,-129 (35), on the questions inConclusion (4)  above.    that, subjectto any comments he might receive from,members of the Cabinet, the Secretaryof State should, be authorised to forward the revised statement of views to Parisfor the information of the FrenchG overnment .(NOTF:    The general conclusion of the cabinet was to approve of the views set forth in CP.-129 (35), Para .7 (2),  onquest ions(a)  ^subject to eare beingexercised as to the wording    of thelast three lines on the subject ofindiscriminate bombing)  (b) and (c):to reserve their views on questions(d) and (e) for the present:

If the French Government^eal with these questions expeditiously,we should also get them discussed bythe Italian and Belgian GovernmentsaOur objective sh ou 1 d be a * is c us s i on as  early as possible between the IocarnoPowers,    At the moment, however, wecould no&quot;!&quot;  state at what point  it wouldbe possible to bring the Germans  intothe discussion.    If it should- be found impossible to obtain an early answerfrom the French Government,  the questionof a communication to the other Powersnamed would have to be re-considered.We must avoid pledging ourselves toFrance not to approach other na4: ionsuntil we had their consent,(9) that the Secretary 0^ State ^or ForeignAffairs should authorise fhe Ministerfor League of Nations Affairs to informthe French Government that ^is Majesty&apos;sGovernment adhere to the London Communiqueof February 3,  19 35,  and intend to workfor all the questions mentioned therein(pastern Pact,, Danubian Pact, Limitationof land Armaments, as well as  Air pact and Limitation of Air Armaments)0(lO) that the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should authorise fhe Ministerfor League of Nations Affairs to presson the French Government the importanceof Aerial Disarmament from the point, ofview o^ France herself.
GOVERNMENT OPINDIA BILL.Method, of election to theFederal upper house (Councilof State).(previous reference;Cabinet 14 (35)Conclusion 4).7.    The Secretary of State for India as a mattertheof urgency asked/authority of the Cabinet to depart,if he found it necessary in the course of the debate in the House of Lords, from one of the provisionsof the Government of India Bill affecting theelection of the Federal Upper Chamber.On the question of election to the LowerFederal Chamber, he proposed to stand firm on theprovisions included in the Bill, namely forindirect election by the Lower Houses of theProvincial Legislatures.     Under the provisions ofthe Bill the Federal Upper House is .to be electedindirectly by members of the Provincial UpperHouses where these exist and in the UnicameralProvinces by the members of specially createdelectoral colleges.        In the Second Readingdiscussions on the Bill in the House of Lordsit had become clear that the Government would be opposed by Liberal and Labour Peers as well as bya certain number of other Peers.      He wantedauthority if strongly pressed, while&apos;standing firm on the provisions of the Bill so far as the LowerChamber was concerned, to modify the arrangements-for the election of the Federal Upper House bythe substitution of direct election in communalterritorial constituencies on a franchise witha very high property qualification.In the course of discussion the Secretaryof State mentioned that special arrangements wouldhave to be made for the small minorities, that isto say, Europeans, Anglo-Indians, IndianChristians and depressed classes.- The Cabinet were reminded that the arrange-ment in the present Bill for the election of the
Upper House had &quot;been adopted as part of an under-standing with Sir Austen Chamberlain and his friendswho had pressed for this measure if they were tosupport the Bill.The Secretary of State for India informed the Cabinet that he had discussed the question with sir Austen Chamberlain and gathered that if thechange were made by the House of Lords he wouldexpress his dissatisfaction when the Bill returned from the House of Lords but would not press hisobjections.      On this understanding the cabinet agreed:That the Secretary of State for india should be authorised, if pressed in debate, to drop the present provisions in the Government of India Bill inrespect of the election of the FederalUpper House and to substitute directelections in communal territorialconstituencies on a high franchise.
