The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet thathe had received a letter from Mr Lloyd George statingthat, in view of the Prime Minister&apos;s speech in theHouse of Commons on the previous day, he presumed that the Government did not intend, to adopt his proposals and that he wished, to be authorised to make public his own proposals instantly.   He himself had told Mr Lloyd George that he wished to consult theCabinet and would let him have an answer the sameafteraoon.The Cabinet were given to understand that thepublication of Mr Lloyd George&apos;s Memorandum wouldprobably take place on Saturday next, July 13th.After some discussion the Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Prime Minister should beauthorised to inform Mr Lloyd Georgethat-there was no objection to thepublication of his Memorandum;(b) That, with a view to publication ofthe Government&apos;s reply very shortly after that of Mr Lloyd George*sMemorandum, the following procedure should be carried out:-(i) The Chancellor of the exchequer should arrange for the circula-tion of the draft reply to theC ab in et as s o on as pos s lb 1 e:(ii.)

The Minister of Labour informed, the Cabinetthat the Report of the Commissioner for SpecialAreas (England and Wales) would be ready for publication on Wednesday of next week.   The PrimeMinister had referred this Report to the depressed areas Committee, but the Minister of Labour thoughtthat the pres entatlon of the Report to parliament could not wait for the conclusions of the Committeeon its recommendations,Without taking any decision on the date of publication, the Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Minister of Labour should circulate proofs of the Report tothe Cabinet before the comingweek-end:(b) that a Meeting of the depressed areas Committee should be heldon Monday next, July 15th, at 12 Moon:(c) That the question should beconsidered by the Cabinet atthe Special Meeting on Monday,July 15th, at 5,30 p.m,, referredto in the previous Conclusion:(d) that as the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries would be engaged inthe House of Commons and might be unable to attend the Cabinet, theParliamentary Secretary to theMinistry of Agriculture and fisheries should, be available if the Cabinetdesired his presence to advise them on any point connected with theAgricultural aspects of the question.

AfterReference!Cabinet 26 explaining the effect of the Resolutions to be( 54)    C on-elusion 10.)      confirmed by the Bill, which was practically formal/LA,,        and usually occupied very little Parliamentary time,the Chancellor of the Exchequer ashed authority tointroduce it and proceed with it at once, subjectto any drafting or other minor amendments that mightbe found necessary, as the Whips were anxious thatit should be introduced immediately and there being no convenient meeting of the Home Affairs Committee.The Cabinet approved the proposalsof the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
CIVIL AVIATION 4.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer informedCOMMITTEE.the Cabinet that the General Purposes Committee hadf- r^(yj^s;   agreed on the establishment of a Committee toconsider the question of aerodromes for civilaviation.   The question of the Chairman, however,was still outstanding.   He and the Secretary ofState for Air had. now reached agreement on thesubject, and he asked the Cabinet to approve theirjoint nominee.The Cabinet agreed  That Sir Henry Maybury should beappointed Chairman of the CivilAviation Commiitee.
THE BOLIVIA&apos;PARAGUAYDISPUTE.5. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that, on a recommendation bythe League of Nations Committee, the arms embargo(previous reference:Cabinet 8(35), Gon-elus ion 4 .)had already been withdrawn some time ago so far asB o 1 iv i a w a s c on. c e r n e d .The League of nations committee had now suggested that it should, be with-drawn for Paraguay also.    He asked the Cabinet togive him authority to withdraw the embargo if he were satisfied that other nations had withdrawn it.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To authorise the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs to withdraw the embargo on the exportation of arms to Paraguay if he were satisfied that other nations had taken similar action:(b) To authorise the President of theBoard of Trade to approve applioa-tions for licences for the exportationof arms and munitions of war toParaguay, after consultation with theForeign Office.
DISPUTE yprtw^tRTjITALY AM)ABYSSINIAt (ETHIOPIA).(previous refer ence &apos;Cabinet 35(35), Con-clusion 2.)6. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that since the last Meeting of the Cabinetthe following new factors had occurred in the italo-Abyssinian question&apos;:-(l) Signer Mussolini, otonding on a cannon^had delivered a speech, of a truculentcharacter.(2) The Secretary of State had had an importantconversation with the Italian ambassador on Friday last (July 5th) when SignerGrandi had suggested, somewhat vaguely,that a meeting might be held of the three powers signatory of the 1906 Agreement.In consequence,  the British Ambassador inParis had been instructed to mention theItalian Ambassador&apos;s suggestion to M, Lavaland to enquire whether the French Governmentwould, agree to a proposal being made at Romefor a meeting of France, Italy and thiscountry for examination of the Abyssinianproblem, as provided for in Articles I and of the Triple Agreement signed in london on the 13th December, 1906 (F.0. telegram to Paris No, 178 of July 6th).   M, Laval&apos;8first reaction had been not unfavourable,and he had. promised to reply after ameeting of the French Cabinet on July 9th,but as yet it had not arrived.(-.3) News had been published in the press that morning that the Italo-AbyssinianCommittee of Conciliation had broken up at&apos; ^he Hague on the previous day.   this might involve an early Meeting of theCouncil of the League of Nations:   but the
Secretary-General to the League was inLondon and the Secretary of State hoped to consult him.The position at the moment was so obscure thatthe Secretary of State did. not ash for any decisionsfrom the Cabinet.A discussion of a preliminary character tookplace, in the course of which certain suggestions were made, which the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs undertook to consider, viz.fi) ^hat further representations shouldbe made to the Italian Governmentprotesting against the continuedattacks on British policy in theItalian Press, including articlesby Dr. Gayda, in the HGiornaledfItalia&quot;, a newspaper which was known to be under the close controlof Signer Mussolini.   As the wholeItalian Press was controlled   it mustbe assumed that the art-ieles    andespecially those in the &quot;Giornaled* Italia&quot;, were issued with SignerMussoliniTs knowledge and, possibly,inspiration.    It was particularly important to give formal denial ofthe alleged movements of Britishtroops.   The suggestion was that theSecretary of State should send an aide-memoire both to the italian ambassador in London and the british ambassador in Rome for communicationfirst to Signer Mussolini and SignerSuvich   in person,(ii) That while efforts should, of course,be continued for reaching&apos;a settlement to avert war, the position had nowbk\fi$n. reached a stage when the Foreign Officeand other Government Departmentsconcerned ought to be considering theproblems that would face us if war should break out between Italy andAbysainia.   Wo publie reference shouldbe&quot;made, however, to this matter atpresent-,(iii) That in the present stage of the disputeit would be advisable, in the Parlia-mentary Debate, to be extremely cautiotison the&quot; subject of the collective responsibility of the nations.It was also suggested that we shouldnot continue to press strongly for ameeting of the signatories of the 1905Agreement/ and that at the Meeting ofawd J/-04, wp, net-dtetirtLi K^CUt;   A      -7-
the Council of the League we shouldnot make any proposals .    In any event it was urged that^no approaoh shouldiv) That there might be considerable advantages in an early Meeting ofthe Council of the League of Nations,and that if such a Meeting should takeplace every effort should be made toget the League to elicit from SignerMussolini publicly the demands on .Abyssinia which he had stated in privateto the Minister for League of nations affair.(v) That in the Debate on Foreign affairs in the Rouse of Commons on the following afternoon no mention should be made of matters communicated to the Ministerfor League   of Nations Affairs in private conversation, but that therewould be no objection to quoting public speeches in which Signer Mussolini was reported to have ventilated the sameideas .(vi) That in the forthcoming Debate in theMouse of Commons the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs should make over&amp;vhelm^.ingiy clear that there was no truth inthe Press statements that we had approachedFrance on the question of economic sanctions.The Cabinet agreed.  (a) That, pending the reply of theFrench Government to the questionsaddressed to them and pending thesequel to the break-up of the Italo-Abyssinian ConeiliationCommission, it was impossibleto decide on their policy inthe dispute between Italy and.Abys s in la:(b) That the Secretary of State forForeign. Affairs should initiatea study in the Foreign Office ofthe problems likely to arise inthe event of an outbreak of war between Italy and Abyssinia:(c) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should make furtherpro tee t s to th e It a 1 la n G o v er nm ent-about the misrepresentations in the&quot;Italian Press of British policy,and. particularly of British troop movements.
ABYSSINIA.Supply ofArms to.(previous reference:Cabinet 28 (35)Conclusion 9).Mips)/.7.      The President of the Board of Trade informed the Cabinet that at any moment applications might he received at the Board of Trade for licences to exportarms and munitions of war to Abyssinia.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs referred to a Memorandum he had circulated on thesubject (CP.  138 (35)), but said he did not desire adecision that day.The Cabinet agreed:(a) To postpone consideration of cp.  138 (35) until their next regular weekly meeting:(b) If any application for a licence for the exportation of arms and munitions of war to Abyssiniashould be received in the meanwhile,the President of the Board of trade should hold the matter up until theCabinet meeting.
PROPOSED air pact AND AIRLIMITATIONAGREEMENT.I Relativef Questions.(previous reference:Cabinet 35 (35)Conclusion 3).FAI THE NAVAL1 CONFERENCE,   1935.1 The Anglo-GermanI Agreement.^(previous Reference:j Cabinet 34 (35)I Conclusion 4).P. P..8.    The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs drew the attention of the Cabinet to his telegram to paris, No.  171 of the 6th July, on the subject ofthe Air Pact which had been conceived in a cautiousspirit and conformed in letter and spirit with theCabinet decision referred to in the margin.      no reply had yet been received. In the Debate inParliament on the following day he proposed to refer to the matter with caution and to put forward the difficulties of inducing the nations concerned to confer on the subject of an Air Pact.      On thequestion of simultaneity between the- Air Pact andthe other questions referred to in the imglo-FrenchDeclaration of February 3rds he proposed to adoptthe same line as that of his predecessor a few v/eeksago.        On the subject of the Naval Agreement he did not intend to adopt an apologetic attitude andwould take the line that it was a very good Agreement.He had arranged that the First Lord of the admiralty should be ready to reply to Mr. Lloyd George if heshould raise the question of submarines and generally,on the Naval Treaty.      Sir Herbert Samuel,  the leader of the Opposition Liberals, had informed him that hewas strongly in favour of the Naval Treaty,
GERMAN 9.    The Home Secretary raised as a matter of refugees.--- urgency   a    question affecting the temporaryUnofficial admission of certain German aliens into this country.Committee on,He had received a letter from the Secretary of a(previous self-constituted Committee which included Miss Maudreference:Cabinet 27 (33)      Royden, Mr.  Priestley, Mr.  Seymour Cocks ^VI. P. , and conclusion 8).other well-known people which was to meet that very day to make inquiry into the treatment of refugees from Germany.      In this letter a list wasgiven of a number of persons who had been driven out from Germany by the Nazi regime and who were dueto arrive in England during the next two days forthe purpose of assisting Miss Royden&apos;s Committee,after which they would return from whence they came.There was nothing to be said against any of thepersons concerned who, if arriving in the ordinary way with their passports in order, would be admittedas a matter of course.      The question arose, however,as to whether their admission ought to be approved in the present circumstances.      There was not the smallest doubt that the self-constituted Committeelike the so-called &quot;trial&quot; in connection with theReichstag fire a year or two ago, would be muchGermanresented by the/Government and the Nazis generally.The British Government had no power to stop theCommittee from meeting, out they had the power to stop the arrival of the German witnesses from theContinent (with the exception of one who had already been admitted), and the German Government might havea grievance if they did no&quot;c use their power.The issue before the Cabinet, therefore, wasone between the admission of the German witnesses atan unofficial inquiry which could do no   good
and would be prejudicial to our relations withGermany, and their exclusion which the cabinet recognised was liable to be strongly resented inthis country as a breach of our traditions ofliberty and free speech, e specially when considered from the point of view of the action of our owncitizens in the matter.The Cabinet agreed:That no obstruction should be placedin the way of the admission of theGerman witnesses at the unofficialCommittee of Inquiry.
THE MEAT 10.      The Minister of agriculture and FisheriesSITUATION.informed the Cabinet he had nothing to report(Previous as to the meat negotiations.Reference:Cabinet 35 (35)Conclusion 5).Eft.
