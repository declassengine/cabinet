The Cabinet had before then; a Note by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP.-208 (35))circulating (in continuation of CP.-200 (35)) Proposalsadopted by the Committee of Eighteen at Geneva on the2nd and 6th November in connection with the applicationof sanctions to Italy.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs explained that the above Note had been circulated forinformation only.   He did not propose to open up thequestion of the proposed new sanctions at the present meeting, as the Prime Minister had already agreed tohold a Special Meeting of the Cabinet on Monday next.The Cabinet agreed  To hold a Special Meeting on Monday next, December 2nd, at 3&apos;p.m. forthe purpose of considering the Italo-Abyssinian situation.(NOTE:    The Lord Chancellor, who had anunavoidable engagement forMonday afternoon,&quot; was asked bythe Prime Minister to let. himhave the benefit of his viewsbeforehand on the important questions to be discussed.)
EGYPT. 3. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that the Egyptian Government had co-operated(Previous^,CahinetC4V well- with the League of Nations in the matter off35), Gon-clusion 5.)sanctions against Italy.   There had been some nervous-ness in Egypt lest we should exploit the situation to the detriment of Egyptian Independence.   Thepresence of the British Fleet at Alexandria had been welcomed, subject to some misgivings on the pointjust merit ioned .   He himself therefore had taken theopportunity of his Guildhall speech to make clear thatwe had no intention of exploiting the situation&apos;    thatwe were grateful for their co-operation;   and at thesame time he had made a guarded reference to thefuture when the time came for our relations to beplaced on a permanent footing satisfactory to both countries .   The form of words he had used on the abovethree points had been agreed with Sir Miles Lampson,and he had also made clear that the Egyptian Consti-tutions of 1923 and 193o had not been satisfactory,and had given a hint that in any future discussionswe should have to take that view.   Subsequently theEgyptian politicians had exploited the situation.There had been riots and some casualties.   Theostensible gaaoon was his own speech, but there wasno doubt that at -betto-,a- t-he -real ge^ee-^N^s- Italianpropaganda,/.   Since that time he had received assurancesboth from Nesslm Pasha and King Fuad that the speechhad had nothing to do with the riots, and that thewords he had used were escaetly what was required.He warned his colleagues that a larger question was coming on the horizon, namely, as to whether thereshould be negotiations on the subject, of an egyptian treaty during the lifetime of the present Parliament .In his view he himself was rather disinclined to
negotiations unless they/w^i^4X^a^^e4 of successMe would deprecate abortive negotiations.The Cabinet took note of the above.
4. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs made a brief statement as to the present positionbetween China and Japan.   It was a ease of Japanexploiting the situation while other countries werepre-occupied elsewhere, as  ,       had several timesoccurred before. It looked, however, as though theirpresent move had been a &quot;damp squib&quot;.   The onlyProvince that had declared, an autonomous regime, wasin the demilitarised zone, where Japanese influencepredominated.    It looked, also, as if Tokio haduttered a word of caution.   On the present occasionJapan had seized the pretext of Sir Frederick Leith-Ross&apos;s visit, coupled with the proposed Loan.   he agreed with His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Tokio, andthe Brattffitfr-Mfeiioteg/ in Peking, as to the undesirabil-ity of beating an ignominious retreat in the face ofunreasonable objections to the Loan on the part of either Japan or America.   Sir Frederick Leith-Ross,however, had been warned to proceed with greatcaution, so as to give no pretext to Japan forfurther action.   Sir Frederick would stay in Chinafor the present, and might later decide to come homevia Tokio, where, if conditions became more favour-able, he might be able to induce the Japanese to consent to the proposed Loan.   At present, however,it did not look as though the Loan would be likelyto succeed.The Chancellor of the Exchequer concurred withthe Secretary of State for- Foreign Affairs and addedthat at present the necessity for a Loan to China was rather less immediate -   It had always been understoodthat Sir Frederick Leith-Ross was to tackle the currency situation in China, for which a Loan wasnecessary.   Events, however, had been telescoped, andthe Chinese had managed to tide over their immediate
financial embarrassment by a sale of silver to theunited States of America .    In reply to a question bythe Secretary of State for India he did not think theprice of silver was likely to be seriously affected atpresent.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs added,in reply to a question, that the Japanese GeneralDoihara&apos;s action was acquiesced in rather thanpromoted by the Japanese Foreign Office.   He also saidthat as soon as the present troubles arose he had instructed His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington todiscuss the matter with the State Department.   the reply he had received was that they were not yet fully informed of the facts, and he was satisfied that theAmerican Government had no intention of taking action.The Cabinet took note of the above.-6-

RAILWAYDEVELOPMENT(previous reference:Cabinet 32(35), Con-clusion 12 .)6.   in the course of the discussion on theKing&apos;s Speech the Chancellor of the Exchequer referredto the promise in the Speech of a Bill to authorisethe guarantee by the State of a loan to enable RailwayCompanies to carry out special development which willadd to transport facilities.   Re recalled that he had -been authorised to see the Chairmen of the RailwayCompanies on the subject, and as a result of these negotiations an announcement o^ the Government *policy had been made during the Election.   Re now asked authority *o introduce a Resolution and Billin Parliament.   The passage of the Bill would benecessary before Christmas.   The Bill was onprecisely the same lines as the London passenger transport Bill, including the guarantee of a loan ofabout&apos;  2 6,000,000 to a special Financial Company whowould lend the money to the Railway Companies.In these circumstances he suggested that it was unnecessary for the Bill to go before the Committeeof Nome Affairs,. which had dealt with the correspond-ing London&quot;Passenger Transport Bill.   There was really no difference in principle or detail betweenthe two measures .The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Chancellor of the exchequer should have authority to introduce aResolution and a Bill in parliament for the Railway Development Scheme,and that every effort should be madeto secure the passage of the bill through Parliament before Christmas:(b) That it was unnecessary for theCommittee- of Rome Affairs to considerthe Bill.

APPENDIX.Draft of the King&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament.December 3, 1935.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons.MY relations with foreign Powers continue to be friendly.My Government&apos;s foreign policy will as heretofore be based on a firmsupport of the League of Nations. They will remain prepared to fulfil, inco-operation with other members of the League, the obligations of the Covenant.In particular, they are determined to use at all times the full weight of their influence for the preservation of peace.In pursuance of these obligations My Government have felt compelled toadopt, in co-operation with some fifty other States Members of the League,certain measures of an economic and financial nature in regard to Italy. At thesame time they will continue to exert their influence in favour of a peaceacceptable to the three parties in the dispute, namely. Italy, Ethiopia, and theLeague of Nations.My Government have issued invitations to the Governments of the othercountries which were parties to the Washington and London Naval Treaties toattend a Conference in London this month with a view to the conclusion of a new international treaty for the limitation of naval armaments. I have learned with satisfaction that all the invitations to this Conference have been accepted, andI trust that its labours will be crowned with success.Members of the House of Commons,The Estimates for the Public Service will be laid before you.The fulfilment of our international obligations under the Covenant, no lessthan the adequate safeguarding of My Empire, makes it urgently necessarythat the deficiencies in My Defence Forces should be made good. My ministers will in due course lay before you their proposals, which will be limited to theminimum required for these two purposes.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons,The policy of My Ministers, while continuing to foster the general recovery of trade, industry and agriculture, will pay special regard to those areas in whichthe burden of unemployment is greatest and to the development of any measureslikely to be advantageous to them.The problem of securing improved conditions in the coal-mining industryis receiving the anxious consideration of My Ministers. Active steps are beingtaken to co-ordinate the selling arrangements of the industry and the necessary orders under Part 1 of the Coal Mines Act, 1930, will be laid before you.In pursuance of the policy of re-organisation, a Measure will be introduced to provide for the unification of coal royalties under national control.In the opinion of My Government the time has come when the existing provisions for the safety of workers in mines should be reviewed in the light of modern scientific knowledge. I shall, as soon as possible, appoint commissioners to inquire fully into this important matter.12384
Proposals for making improved arrangements for assistance to theunemployed and for the insurance of agricultural workers against unemploymentwill be laid before you.A Bill will be introduced to authorise the guarantee by the State of a loan to be raised for the purpose of enabling the Railway Companies to carry outspecial developments which will add to transport facilities and to the convenience of travellers.A Measure will be submitted to you for promoting the further developmentof our civil air communications, both in this country and throughout the Empire;and for dealing with other matters relating to air navigation.It is the intention of My Ministers to proceed at an early date with theproposals laid before the last Parliament for dealing with the problem of surplusproductive capacity in the spinning section of the cotton industory.My Government are convinced of the need for an early and substantialdevelopment of the educational services of the country. A Bill will be introduced to amend the law in England and Wales relating both to the age of compulsoryschool attendance and to assistance from public funds towards expenditure on voluntary School buildings. Action will also be taken, in co-operation with LocalAuthorities and others, to increase the effectiveness of the other educationalservices. In particular, the improvement of the school medical arrangements, theextension of physical education, and the development of Technical Schools, will receive the attention of My Government.My Ministers will continue to promote actively the development of the social services, and to take vigorous measures to improve the health and physique of thenation. They will press forward the work of slum clearance in order to ensurethat the programmes submitted by local authorities are carried out within theperiod contemplated, and they will encourage the active administration of theHousing Acts of 1935 which enable local authorities to make a direct attack uponthe evils of overcrowding.Careful consideration has been given by My Government to the organisationof the maternity services with a view to providing better care for women inchild-birth, and a Bill will be introduced for the provision by local authorities inco-operation with voluntary associations of an organised service of salariedmidwives.My Ministers will continue to give close consideration to the further improve-ment of conditions in Scotland and among Measures to that end a Bill will beintroduced providing for the raising of the school age.Other Measures of importance will be laid before you and proceeded with as time and opportunity offer.And I pray that the blessing of Almighty God may rest upon yourdeliberations.
