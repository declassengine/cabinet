The Chancellor of the exchequer, the PrimeMinister said, had paid an early call on the foreign secretary and would attend the Cabinet a little later,^he position had. to be considered from the point ofview both of the forthcoming Weeting of the council at Geneva an^ the Parliamentary Debate -
mv ITALO- 2 .   The Cabinet began their discussion by oonsider-lySSINIANSlSPTTTE. ing a point against which strong criticism had beene proposed       directed publicly, that Abyssinia would have to give[asis ofpeace. an undertaking not to build a railway from any portshe acquired on the Red. Sea.(previous reference: The Minister for League of Rations Affairs said,fcatinet ^4&apos;(3^), Con-        that the document (C.P.-235 (35)) he had presented, toclusion 3 .)the Cabinet on December 9th (Cabinet 52 (35)) did not contain any reference to the above point.    The bar to[The suggestedAbyssinian the construction of a railway had been included in thePort .original French draft as initialled, by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs and M. Laval.   But it didnot appear in the English translation which had. beenconsidered, by the Cabinet.   As^a^aa^e^o^Pa^t.- thepassage had subsequently been deleted from theoriginal French text by arrangement between Sir robert vansittart and M. Leger, of the French ForeignOffice, on the ground, that it did. not properly form part, o^ the agreement.   Sir Robert Vans it tart had explained to thim, and. the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs had confirmed it, that the discussions on whichthis paragraph had. been based had related, not to theproposal made in the draft agreement for an exchangeof territory which would, give to Abyssinia the port, ofAssab and a corridor thereto, hut in connection with thediscussion of an alternative proposition for the surrender to Abyssinia of Zeila, which the Emperormight, prefer to Assab.    That was why,/ Sir Robert. .Vansittart ha^ insisted with M. Leger on the removalof the passage from the initialled French text.Tn that event there was a good. ca)se for not allowing the construction of a railway, for the reason that&apos;wewere committed by the Treaty of 1905 not to constructfrom Somaliland. ports a rival to the French railway
from  Jibuti.   He added, that economically the construc-tion of a railway from either port was unlikely, since no-one would be anxious to find the money, and theEmperor himself was a large shareholder in the JibutiRailway.    He proposed, therefore, subject to theagreement, of the Cabinet and of the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs (whom he intended to consult later in the morning) to obtain agreement, with the FrenchGovernment that the Article had never applied to theAssab proposal hut only to the Zeila alternative   inwhich latter case there would in fact be no exchange of territory involved.^he latter point, that in the Zeila alternativeno exchange of territory was involved, was felt at onceby the Cabinet to raise a very serious political diffi-culty .    One of the more defensible principles on whichthe proposed basis of peace terms had. been drawn wasthe first, providing for an exchange of territory, whichthe House of Commons had. been given to understand wasto be advantageous to both parties.    If, however,Abyssinia were to obtain Zeila instead of Assab and nocession of territory by Italy was involved, that principle would not be fulfilled.   Moreover, if theEmperor of Abyssinia had. been willing to consider theterms and had. expressed, a preference for Zeila, he wouldhave had to he told that he could not, in that event,have a railway   which would, it was suggested, be avery difficult position to defend.Attention was drawn also to the following passagecontained in the telegram of December 10th to the british minister in Abyssinia:-&quot;I add for your own information that thetwo Governments have agreed to obtain from the Abyssinian Government at theappropriate moment an undertaking not toconstruct from the por^ which it acquiresany railway communicating with the interior
and also an undertaking to concludewith the French Government all necessary arrangements to safeguard the interestsof the port of Jibuti and of the Franco-Fthiopian railway.&quot;Some emphasis was placed on the words &quot;from the portwhich it acquires&quot;, which gave the impression thatiAlcU. teUvtUieid : they applied, to ^SeAla- as well as to -As sab .    Tt wasUnite ef Uui pointed out, however, that this part op the telegram/&apos;iiad^d tsi*      i was only for the personal information of the Britishfitful, j&apos; Minister,  that nothing had been said, to the Emperoron this subject, and nothing had been arranged, as towhen &quot;the appropriate moment&quot; would arrive.Tie attention of the Cabinet was drawn to theintroductory words of the Annex to the telegram sent toAbyssinia on December 10th (Cmd.^044, page 17, No.6 -Annex I - Exchange of Territories):-&quot;Tie Governments of Great Britain and.France agree to recommend to FisMajesty the Emperor of Ethiopia theacceptance of the following exchanges of territory between Ethiopia and. Italy&quot;,as   well      as      to the following passage which occurred, lower down in the same paragraph:-&quot;(d) Ethiopia will receive an outletto the sea with full sovereign rights...&quot;The Zeila proposition was criticised as inconsistent with the above passages because it did. not includeeither  &quot;exchange of territories&quot; or &quot;full sovereignrights&quot;, since there was a derogation from these if a railway could not be constructed.    The propositionsappeared, mutually destructive.    It was suggested.,,therefore, that the French Government ought to havebeen told that these propositions would involve an alteration in the 1906 Treaty so as to.permit of theconstruction of a railway.The Minister for League of Nations Affairs reminded the Cabinet, however, that the Abyssinians would havebeen authorised to build a railway from the port, to link
up with, the Jibuti Railway.    The telegram to Abyssiniaof December 10th had been sent on his authority.Embarrassment was felt that this aspect of thequestion had not been before the Cabinet when they had approved the proposals in C.P.-23^ (3^) on December 9th&apos; Cabinet, ^ (^)  (a)) .The suggestion was made, and received a good, dealof support, that the French Government woul^ have tobe told at once that His Majesty&apos;s Government had never agreed to the proposition that no railway shouldbe built from the Abyssinian port, and that in the-Parliamentary Debate the spokesman of the Governmentshould be authorised to say so.    Before doing so,however, it would be very important to check carefullyas to whether in any telegram, document or Minute that had been circulated the matter had. in fact never been mentioned, and the Cabinet were reminded by one memberthat in the first version of the Paris proposalsAnnex ii. r CP.-2*^ (3*) f a translation of the passage in theSub-Annex .original signed, agreement had been included but thatit did not appear in a version circulated later in thesame day, which had superseded the former.The Cabinet realised , however, that no decision could be taken in the absence of the Foreign Secretary.:The Chancellor of the Exchequer, who entered at about this point, infer-ed the Cabinet that he had. not&apos; jdiscussed this particular question with the foreign secretary .mhe Cabinet were reminded that the agreement was limited to what appeare&apos;&quot; in the White Paper (Cmd.5044)and that it did. not include any reference to the baron the construction of 0 railway:    also that ifAbyssinia, were to opt for Zeila instead, of Assab itwould be because the Emperor preferred Zeila without an exchange of territory to Assab with such an exchange,
which, did not appear so indefensible a position.&quot;he Cabinet were informed that the matter wasbeing raised in a Question in Parliament on thefollowing day.    It was realised, therefore, thatthe Government woul^ have to decide what policy it-should adopt.&quot;he Cabinet were informed, that the difficultiesthey had been discussing were liable to have the worst possible effect on the Dominions, and that theconsequences might be very grave unless a satisfactoryexplanation was forthcoming.It was suggested also that if the Cabinet wereto decide virtually to drop the whole of theproposed basis of peace owing to the bad receptionit had received, the particular difficulty of theport and. the railway would, be less acute.&quot;he Cabinet appreciated that the subject couldnot usefully be discussed further in the absence o^the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs or anyone who had been present at. the Paris conversations, andThat  the Prime Minister,  in the courseo:p the day, should, see the Secretary ofState for Foreign iVf-cairs, clear up theposition, and agree with him as to theline to be taken.in the parliamentary debate.    If necessary, the cabinet could be sxmmoned to meet again inthe course of the day, but the PrimeMinister felt that it would be preferable,if possible, in the present excitedstate of public opinion on the subject,to deal with it at the Meeting of theCabinet already arranged for the morrow.&apos; See also Conclusion 3 as to the PrimeMinister&apos;s interview with the foreign secretary .)
3.      The Cabinet next t^ok up the question of theline to be taken by the Minister for League ofNations Affairs at Geneva and by the government spokesmen in the forthcoming Debates in both houses of Parliament in view of the bad reception given to theAnglo-French proposals both at home and abroad.The Minister for League of Nations affairs read to the cabinet a telegram from the british minister at Addis Ababa, No. 436 of the 16th December,stating that the Emperor and his advisers werebewildered at the association of His Majestyfs Govern-ment with the proposals and giving the general natureof the Minister&apos;s reply.      He also read telegram No.435from Addis Ababa, asking if the Abyssinian Governmentwere now free to publish those terms.      In addition,he reported an interview which Sir Robert Vansittarthad had with the Italian Ambassador who had asked anumber of questions about the proposals, indicating that Signor Mussolini was not very enamoured with them.The position at Geneva, he reported, had been one ofbewilderment.      He had been thinking out the best wayto handle the difficulty and he had prepared a draftproposal as to the lines of the statement he shouldmake (Appendix).      He asked that if his proposal were approved it should not be treated as an instructionbut as a general guide,  since it was impossible to foresee the precise circumstances at Geneva in whichhe would be called upon to use it.     For example,the words on page 1, lines 4 to 8, on the subject of sanctions could probably be used more appropriatelyif the question of Sanctions was raised.
(There was a short interval during which theCabinet studied the document handed roundby the Minister for League of Nations Affairs).The Minister for League of Nations affairs had heard that attempts were being made to adjourn the Geneva meeting.      He proposed to send a messagethat morning asking that a public session should be heldsome time on Wednesday, December 18th (which wouldprecede the Parliamentary Debate).      He proposedto show the draft, if it met with Cabinet approval, toM. Laval.     He was not sure what his reaction would be.In the fifth paragraph of the Appendix, it wassuggested that for the words &quot;in any event1&apos; should besubstituted &quot;against the disagreement of any of thethree Parties&quot;.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in his conversation with the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairsj the latter had said there was nothing in theAppendix that would embarrass him except the very wordsthat had just been mentioned, &quot;in any event&quot;, and hewould hand the Minister for League of Nations Affairsan alternative wording.      He then gave some account ofthe general line which he understood the foreign secretary proposed to take in the Debate - thoughentering a caveat that he had nothing in writing and could only give a general impression.     As he understoodit, the case which the Foreign Secretary would putwould be based on the assumption that Sanctions couldnot be carried further unless the whole of the Leagueof Nations was fully.prepared to back them up and faceany possible military consequences.     At the presenttime there was no indication that any other nationhad prepared itself to do that.      The result was thatthe burden of any such consequences would fall on this
country alone.      The Chancellor had reminded theForeign Secretary that this line, although highlydefensible as an argument for not extending Sanctions,was somewhat vulnerable as a justification of theproposed basis of peace.       The Foreign secretary had pointed out that the kind of terms of peaceenvisaged by those who condemned the Paris proposals was such that could only have been obtained as theresult of a League success, equivalent to greatvictories in the field.     As the position fell far short of one in which the world could dictate terms to Signor Mussolini, there was no chance of gettinganything much better than the Paris terms.  . In other words,  (as the Chancellor of the Exchequer himselfagreed was the case) the public were thinking ofpeace terms which could only be obtained as theresult of far greater pressure on Italy than it had as yet been possible to apply.      In these circum-stances, the Foreign Secretary took the view that theLeague of Nations ought to be faced up to the realities of the situation.      He gathered alsothat in that event the Foreign Secretary did notdismiss the possibility that the Members of the Leaguemight be willing to make the military preparationsnecessary to support more decisive Sanctions.He explained that the Foreign Secretary was notcontemplating a military sanction but merely the preparations to deal with any military aggression by italy which might be provoked by such Sanctions.The above general line was criticised on theground that it might be repudiated by France andother nations who would recall the undertakings theyhad given to support the United Kingdom if attacked.
The Cabinet were reminded that there was nodocument which could be laid to show that any nationwas unwilling to fulfil its responsibilities.      V/hatcould be said was that militarily they were not in afh Hi-posit ion to act.      That, however, was a/tdifficultpoint to make at&apos;-Geneva.The Chancellor of the Exchequer interpolatedthat he had only given a general impression of theattitude of the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs and had not attempted to describe his language.In discussing the line to be taken in the Debate,it was suggested that when the Foreign Secretary was inParis the position had been such as to compel us at Geneva either to go further or to go back inthe matter of Sanctions.      If we went forward newrisics of war were involved.     Against those riskswe had to be safeguarded, not by mere verbal statements,but by categorical assurances.     As such assuranceswere lacking,  it was possible to justify the attemptto obtain peace.Another suggestion was that it was not the dangerof war but a growing conviction of the inevitableslowness of the operation of Sanctions, even ifbacked by America, that necessitated peace.Both the above lines, however, v/ere felt to beopen to the retort that while they applied to the avoidance of further Sanctions, they did not justifythe Paris terms.    They would also give great re-assurances to Signor Mussolini that effective sanctions would never be applied.      In these circumstances, itwas suggested that a better line to follow would be
that suggested &quot;by the Chancellor of the exchequer in an earlier meeting of boldly defending, not somuch the Paris   proposals themselves, as the principles on which they had been based.    To those conversantwith the technical aspects, the Paris proposals weresaid to differ materially from those of the Committeeof Five, although to the non-technical students, thedifference was not so great.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he himself had suggested to the Foreign Secretary that the bestcase might be to founa himself on the Report of theCommittee of Five which had been accepted by the emperor of Abyssinia.      It was true, as had been remarked inthe discussion, that since then war had broken out and Italy had bombed hospitals and so forth,  but a gooddeal could be said on both aspects.      He agreed thatit would not be sufficient to make only the point of thedanger of the extension of the war to Europe, but hethought that combined with a defence of the proposalsa good case might be made.From a similar point of view it was urged thatthe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and theMinister for League of Rations Affairs must act in concert.      The first step was for the latter to makethe statement proposed in the Appendix, so as to makequite clear from the outset that the Government were no longer pressing acceptance of the Paris terms.After that,  the right line would be a bold defenceof the proposals on the lines already suggested.      Inthis connection it was recalled that from the first ithad been assumed that Abyssinia must in some shape orform come under the direction of the League of Nations,and the proposals for an area of development in the
non-Amharic territories of the South could hedefended from that point of view.     After that, a more realistic line might he taken,and it might he &quot;brought home to the Members or the League that a great nationcould only he stopped in its aggression and punishedif all the Members were actually prepared to play their part.The Prime Minister reminded his colleagues thathe, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Ministerfor League of Nations Affairs were to see the foreign secretary, preferably that morning.      In addition,several of them had to deliver very important speeches in Parliament,      In the circumstances, he thought thebest plan would be for the Cabinet to adjourn thediscussion until the next day.The Cabinet were informed that the House of LordsDebate had been postponed from Wednesday untilThursday so that it might be simultaneous with the debate in the House of Commons.The Cabinet agreed:-(a) To approve generally the line suggestedby the Minister for League of nations affair in the draft statement -attached in the Appendix (subject toa verbal amendment in the fifthparagraph to be communicated to himby the Chancellor of the Exchequer),but to leave him latitude as to when and how it should be used at Geneva.(b) That the Prime Minister, the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the Minister for league of Nations Affairs should confer with the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs as to the general line to betaken in the Debate.(c) That the Prime Minister should have discretion as to whether, after his interview with the Foreign Secretary,he would summon a meeting of theCabinet that evening or raise thematter at the regular weekly meetingon the following day.

The Minister for League of Nations affairs proposed that if the question of an oil e embargo were raised at Geneva he should state that His majesty&apos;s government.&apos;s attitude on the matter had not changed,but they required to be satisfied that as a sanctionit would prove effective in existing circumstances.If the matter were raised it would be quite possiblefor him to discuss the military aspects of the possible consequences of an oil sanction.Tie Prime Minister repeated that, as he had again and. again emphasised, the question of praeti-ability must be examined before we could agree to anyoil sanction,    &quot;he appropriate body of the League mustsettle down to that.It was suggested that the matter must be looked into particularly from the point of view of theattitude of the United States of America.The Minister for League of Nations affairs thought it might be preferable that some other nationshould raise this point.,PT1he Cabinet agreed  That if the question of an oil sanctionwere brought up at Geneva., the Ministerfor League of Nations /ffairs should deal with it on the lines of the abovebrief discussion, insisting on a properexamination as to the practicabilityand efficacy of the proposal before any re,:, is ion could be taken, andraising the military aspects, if and when appropriate.

APPENDIX.ARAPT SPEECH BY MR.  EDEN AT GENEVA.Last November, as my colleagues will recall, whenthe Go-ordination Committee agreed upon certain sanctionswhich are now in force, it also envisaged efforts to finda basis of settlement.      / As regards sanctions, it iswell understood that these are possible only within thelimits of collective action, not only promised buteffectually and promptly takenJ7.      As regards a basis of negotiation with a view to peace, the Co-ordination committee approved all attempts to find a basis of discussion betweenthe two parties to this dispute;  and it particularlywelcomed the suggestion that His Majesty&apos;s Government andthe French Government should seek to find such a basis.It was, however, recognised that any proposals whichthese two Governments put forward must be acceptable toall  three parties to the dispute, Abyssinia, Italy and theLeague.It is the essential condition to be fulfilled by any terms of settlement that would be finally pressed upon theparties that they are found to be approved by the League.For the Members of the League are bound to  respect, and todo their utmost to apply the Covenant.It was no easy task which the  two Governments undertook,and, so far as His Majesty&apos;s Government are concerned we hadno illusion as to its difficulty.      Indeed, it may well bemaintained that it has proved to he at the present juncture ofevents an almost impossible task.     But, as I have said, withthe good wishes of the Committee the two Governments made the attempt.
It was proper that the attempt should he made, howeverinvidious the task of those who had to make it.      Even ifthis attempt has been unsuccessful the essential importance of conciliation remains, as the League has frequently recognised.The principle therefore was right, even if its application inthis instance has not availed.It must be emphasised that the Paris proposals which were put forward last week were not advanced as proposals to be insisted on in any event.      They were advanced in order toascertain what the views of the three parties might be upon them, and His majesty&apos;s Government recommended them only forthis purpose.      If, therefore, it transpires that theseproposals which are now before you do not satisfy theessential condition of agreement by the three parties, HisMajesty&apos;s Government could not continue to recommend or support them.      In their minds this particular attempt at conciliationcould not then be regarded as having achieved its object,and His Majesty1s Government for their part would not wishto pursue it further.
