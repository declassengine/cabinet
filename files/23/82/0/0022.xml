mj-R ITALO-ABYSSTNIANDTS?the.Co-operation by other nations in anEmergency .(previous reference:Cabinet 50(&apos;3*)) .GREECE:TURKEY:YUGO-SLAVIA:1 .   The Minister for League of Rations Affair?gave the Cabinet a summary of the replies by various countries to approaches which had been made to themfor co-operation in the event of an aggression by italy arising out of sanctions,    Tiese may besummarised very briefly as follows:-PRANCE: No news since the Meeting ofthe Cabinet mentioned in the margin.Pull co-operation can be relied on.   A Naval Attacheat Athens has been asked for(See below) .The answer is a complete and unconditional acceptanceof our thesis .Situation less satisfactorythan the above .    &quot;&quot;he Navalfacilities we had asked forwould be placed at the disposalof Ris Majesty&apos;s Ships.Consultation with othermembers of the Little Ententeand with Athens and Angorain progress .There was some doubt as to whether the abovecountries wouh conform to our request to make adeclaration similar to the declaration of solidarityalready made by the French Government.   Although,apart from this, their general altitude appeared.satisfactory, there was very little information asto what their co-operation would, mean in practice.Spain had been approached, through the SpanishAmbassador in London, who had. promised, to communicate with the President, of the Republic .    No reply had. as yet been received.The Minister for League of nations affair asked that any telegramspassing between the Admiralty and greece relative to the proposed naval attache should pass through the ForeignOf-ice.(NOTE:    Further details on this question are contained  in C.I.D. Paper D.P.R.-54.)
tot? ITALO-abyssinian dispute.Proposed Re-dispos it action of  Ships inthe Mediter-ranean.2. The First Lord of the Admiralty informed theCabinet that the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee hadreceived a. combined appreciation from the Commanders-in-Chief of the Navy. Army and Air Force in theMediterranean,    ^heir recommendations includedproposals for a re-disposition of certain ships inthe Mediterranean, notably that two Battleshipsshould be withdrawn from the Eastern Mediterranean in exhange to-&quot; a Battle Cruiser.    If the proposal was approved,  the Battleships would be withdrawn from theMediterranean altogether, brought home and paid off,as the Admiralty would be glad to have their crewsfor other purposes.    The object of the exchange wasthat the Battle Cruiser would. haT.,&apos;e greater speed andbe able to strengthen the Light Cruiser forces in theEastern Mediterranean,    For the purposes for which theexchange was proposed, therefore, the Fleet in theEa.st.ern Mediterranean would be strengthened, but  theFirst Lord felt bound to inform his colleagues that-from a. public point of view it might be interpreted as a wea.ken.ing of the Fleet.    If the proposal wassanctioned, the question arose as to whether italy should be informed.    In this connection he reminded theCabinet that the Italians were moving troops withoutany notification to other nations.The Cabinet agreed  (a) &quot;h-:at. at the present  juncture it wouldbe inadvisable for political reasons to take any action which might beregarded publicly as weakening our naval position in the Mediterranean:(b) &quot;hat if the Admiralty still wished tomake the change they should raise thequestion a little later, when it was quite possible that the politicalsituation might be changed and a favour-able reply might be given.
had been sent off late on the previous evening.&quot;Hie Cabinet then discussed the line to be taken^4 A^uw^.   by the Minister for League of Nations Affairs atGeneva .The Minister for League of Nations affairs expressed, the hope that he would not be expected tochampion the proposals made to Italy and Abyssiniain detail at Geneva.   He was not likely to be successfulif he made the attempt, because the representatives would, in the ..^ain, already have made up their minds.T-Te was cleer that ?-. Laval was going to try and weaken the proposals in a direction favourable to Italy.He suggested that he himself should be authorised to resist any such efforts:    to tell M. Laval of the reaction of Parliament  and public opinion in thiscountry to what was known of the proposals, and thatif any alterations were to. be made they should be rather in the other direction,.   As regards oilsanctions the question of the date would depend uponthe replies from the various Governments.    He thoughtour general attitude should be that we were ready totake any action that/mother members of the League wereprepared, to take.    For practical purposes, however,it seemed likely that the question would be postponed pending replies from Italy and Abyssinia to the peace- irALO- 3.   The Cabinet resumed discussion of the questionsabyssinianpjcpTjTE. referred to in the margin, as begun on December 9th and?he proposed     continued on December 101 h.Basis for peace Dis- As the Cabinet were assembling, a telegram (No .263cuss ions .from Paris) from Sir R.

proposals   to which (as the Chancellor of theExchequer suggested) he added the attitude of theUnited States of America.    It was possible to conceivehowever, that the League might wish to act without regard to the United States .The Prime Minister said that the question of whether the oil sanction would, be effective was avery important one, and this might depend largely onthe attitude of the United States of America.   Duringthe discussion he emphasised more than once that thequestion ought to be decided as a business proposition^he sanction ought not to be undertaken unless wewere assured that it would be effective;    and. thequestion of whether America would apply an effectiveembargo appeared, to be one of the essential factors in the case .    Until we knew what America was goingto do we should hold our hand.In the course of the discussion it was pointedout that, according to the latest information, oilmight be sent for Italy&apos;s use either direct or through Japan.   Mr Cordell Hull, the American secretary of State, on the one hand was expressingresentment at the idea of the League waiting forAmerica, but, on the other hand, declined, to say what America would do.    Tn these circumstances itwas felt that too much importance should not be attach:ed. to his att itude.    Tn any event it appeared certainthat America could not act effectively without theapproval of Congress.    Until then it seemed that signor Mussolini could obtain enough oil to carry on.It appeared improbable, therefore, that an oil embargo at the present time couL&apos; be effective.
Another view was that it was not easy for italy to obtain oil, ov;j.ng to the difficulty of paying for large quantities .    Italy&apos;s economic position xvasdeteriorating owing to sanctions.    It was impossibleto say whether an oil embargo would be effective until it was tried.    It was also impossible to predictxvhether, when it came to the point, M. Laval would refuse to co-operate in further sanctions.    It wassuggested that the proper attitude of T-Tis Majesty&quot; sGovernment was, to be prepared to play their part solong as action was collective, and to join with/other member^ of the League if they thought this to be themost effective method, of ending the present difficul-ties, even at the risk of war.     This did not mean,however, that the date need be fixed at present.Politically it was suggested that the important point was not. to give an impression o^ pusillanimity, andthat the consequences of previous action had. not been thought out.    Such a course would be disastrous to our prestige.The Cabinet were reminded, repeatedly of the manyand emphatic decisions they had. taken to the effectthat in no circumstances would we be drawn intomilitary sanctions unless assured, of whole-hearted-operation by Prance.    Information had accumulatedto the effect both that an oil sanction might precipitate hostilities and that whole-hearted co-operation by Prance could not be relied on   thoughreference was made in this connection to a report in&quot;mhe Times&quot; that when M. Laval had taken this line atthe French Cabinet M. Herriot had challenged him.A vieitf which met with a good deal of support wasthat we should aim at maintaining the exipting sanc-tions, but do our best to avoir&quot; an oil sanction.There was no question of reducing existing sanc-tions, but at a time when the Governments principally
concerned were considering the peace proposals sent out on the previous evening, there would be no justifi-cation for fixing a date for the application of an oil sanction.    On the other hand, it was suggested that if italy accepted the offer some countries, includingPrance, might be unwilling to continue the sanctionagains t her.There was general agreement that the Minister for league of Nations Affairs must not, say that we wouldin no circumstances agree to the imposition of an oil sanction at some future date, or that recent events had removed sanctions altogether from the field of act ion.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affahrsreported on his conversations with representatives ofthe Dominions on the previous jday .    The AustralianNigh Commissioner had noi^ boon very much concerned about the effect of the peace proposals on Australianpublic opinion.    Other Nigh Cornmissioners, however, had.been somewhat alarmed at their probable effect on public opinion in their respective Dominions, and soon their Governments.    ^hey said that the terms wouldbe interpreted as better than would have been agreed for Italy before the war started, so that the a.ggressorwould have obtained, an advantage.    So far as merits/were concerned, he and (k&amp;G-$&amp;&amp;&amp;*&amp;$^^^H&quot; the Acrw^ fu&amp;u*f tka.t fyM*j has  M^o   $vUcn^ fchat^.wej?c lArbth, Pia^jtH-^M-d-.had^thoaighi..   Nevertheless there was no mistakingtheir anxiety.   They did not feel that the exchangeof territory in the North was the main difficulty, butthe large area &quot;or economic development for Italy inthe South.    The Nigh Coinmis--practitioner of South Africa,in particular, had been concerned, at the prospect ofarming the Natives.    V/e were not likely to have his
support if,  as was proposed, the Officers of &quot;thegendarmerie were to be predominantly Italian.   TheSecretary of State thought that the dislike expressedby the TTigh Commissioners to this part of the proposalsprobably reflected public opinion in this country.He hoped,  therefore,  that there might be some room for modifications in detail.mhe Chancellor of the Exchequer quoted theprinciples that had been enunciated ^y the Ministerfor League of Nations Affairs in the House of commons on the previous evening, and suggested that his linemight be to repeat those principles, to say that/thequestion of whether their proper application wasembodied in the proposals was a point/he wao puttingIt was suggested, however, that this would not altogether solve the difficulties of the Minister for league of Nations Affairs in supporting these pro-posals, since, quite apart from the principles, thedetails had been recommended by the Secretary of Statefor &quot;Foreign Affairs and M. Laval.    If, therefore,  Italyaccepted them, it would give M. Laval an opportunityto drop sanctions.    A good deal of discussion tookplacp on this point.^he Minister for League o^ Nations Affairs thoughtthat the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s proposal thathe should make use of the three principles a very valuable one.   He did not know how much room he would,have to manoeuvre as to the proposal for an area, ofcolonisation.   He was certain, however, that not onlythe Scandinavian Powers but also the MediterraneanPowers, particularly Turkey, would look askance atthis part of the scheme.    It was possible that withinthe first fey/ days Italy would accept and Abyssiniawould not reply.   M. Laval might then try and
withdraw the existing sanctions.    This he intended to oppose.    If Abyssinia refused, he thought that theexisting sanctions should continue until the partiesto the strife agreed on some basis of settlement.   the trouble, however, would be with M. Laval if Italyaccepted.A suggestion which met with strong support was thats anctions ought to continue unless and until there was an armistice.The Cabinet were reminded that the League itself was actually a party to the proposed peace terms,in so much that, in order to render them effective, theLeague ha-&apos; to co-operate in nominating advisers, and so forth.    If, therefore, the members of the League dislikedthe proposal they could render it ineffective .The Minister for League of Nations Affairs saidthat a good many members of the League would dislike theproposals .    Some would not be willing to interfere withthe Uniter- Kingdom and Prance if they thought that peace would come of it;    but they would dislike taking any responsibility in connection with a settlement.The Cabinet were reminded of the long-ra.nge aspectsof the question, namely, as to the effect of what happened now on deterring a.ggression.   A good many people had, pictured an end of the dispute in which the aggressor would have lost considerably both in material and prestige .    That was a difficult result to achievewithin a reasonable time.   Probably, however, most-people had. contemplated that the eventual terms must include some exchange of territory and some economicprivileges for Italy, bearing in mind that Abyssiniawas not a. civilised country an^ had behaved, very badlyin the past, even, to ourselves.    If, however, that wasthe result, it would come as a shock to public opinion.
It was suggested that public opinion ought to-be gradually prepared for a different result to what ithad expected.    If we were to insist that  Italy was toget nothing and the whole settlement was to be in favourof Abyssinia, it was difficult to see an end to thepresent trouble .    That was one object in the suggestionthat the Minister for League of Nations Affairs should base himself on the principles . .  If Abyssinia were torefuse the proposals it might be worth while to put tothem the principles.    If they refused to discuss them also they might have to be told that we could not backthem any longer.Discussion took place as to whether, in the eventof a refusal of the terms by Abyssinia and perhaps bythe League of Nations, a new situation would, not be created in which it would, be possible to drop thepresent proposals .    It was recalled that we had beenasked by the League to undertake a difficult task, andwe had. carried it out to the best of our ability.    me and Prance were not, however, speaking in the name ofcivilisation, but mer-ly doing our best to get thepa.rties together with a view to a solution.    If theywould not. accept, were we not free?    It was suggested,however, that, having recommended the proposals to theparties, we could not now say that because one partydisagreed we could slip out of our responsibilities aidgo back to the former situation.The Cabinet were reminde^, however, that Italy,because she accepted these proposals, could not expect to escape from sanctions which had been imposedbecause she had been designated an aggressor.    *Veought, therefore, to maintain sanctions;    but if theybroke down owing to the attitude of other jaationswe could not be expected to continue them.The question was asked as to what our attitude wouldbe if the League invited France and. ourselves to make
another attempt.The Minister for League of Nations Affairs said,he would not agree without referring to the Cabinet.Summing up, he suggested, that our foreign policy was still based on the League of Nations, and that weshould try and make collective action effective.If he had to choose between two risks,  (l)  an aggression by Italy, and (2)  a collapse of theLeague, he would consider the former the lesser evil.In this latte^ connection, however, the cabinet were once more reminded, of the fundamental principlethat we were not to become involved in hostilitiesunless France was with us.    --/Ye were, of course,prepared to take our part in collective a.ction, butonly on condition that that action was collective inevery sense of the term, namely, both in its immediateapplication and in any consequences to which it might give rise .It was suggested to the Minister for League ofNations Affairs that he should see M. Laval and. put to him very seriously the consequences that wouldensue if France were to withdraw from sanctions.that would smash the League.    -Vas M. Laval willing totake that responsibility?   Ne was also asked by one member of the Cabinet to remember that, the main objectof the necotiations was to get the parties round, a.table, while maintaining the existing solid front onsanctions.The Minister for League of Nations Affairs said^that a telegram had been sent to Abyssinia, on theprevious evening urging the Emperor to exercise hisusual statesmanship in dealing with this proposal andnot to reject, it out of hand.    The Emperor&apos;s position,however, was not easy, and his internal situation mightbe affected.
]This passage was[drafted before thekarlier part of theinclusion and^ommunieated as a ...^ajjt to the Minister?or League of NationsStairs just beforedeparture foreign?neva on December 11th^ 2 p.m.sexThe Prime Minister, summing up, said that thediscussion had shown a. considerable measure of agreementwith the line suggested at the outset of the discussion by the Minister for League of Nations Affairs, whoat Geneva would be in a relatively isolated positionsomewhat similar to that of a Minister actuallyaddress in,: the House of Commons, and would, bear inmind the views of his colleagues, referring to themfor instructions in case of necessity.The trend of the discussion may be summed up asfollows:-(a) That, in regard to the proposals made toItaly and Abyssinia, the Minister for league of Nations Affairs would have touse his discretion, according to thecircumstances he encountered at, Geneva,as to how far it was necessary for himto champion them, especially in detail.He might find it better to base himself on the three main principles on which,as he himself had announced in the Houseof Commons on the previous evening, theproposals were founded, viz .:-(l) An excha ge o^ territory conveyingdefinite advantages to both sides:(2) League assistance to Ethiopia for thepurpose of social, economic andadministrative developments:(3) Special facilities for Italian settlersand Italian companies in connectionwith that economic development.The Minister would have to bear in mind the criticism which, at a Meeting on theprevious day, the T-Tigh Commissioners ofthe Dominions had directed against theproposals for an Italian Zone of economic expansion and Colonisation in Abyssinia,and. which was likely to be the feature
most criticised in this country and.,indeed, at Geneva itself.   Re should therefore be on his guard againstacquiescing in any modification of theproposals in favour of Italy such asM. Laval might be expected to suggest.Re should not hesitate to inform M. Lavalof the reaction of public opinion in thiscountry to the proposals so far as theywere known, and to indicate that if any alterations were to be made they must be rather in favour of Abyssinia,(b) As regards oil sanctions the Minister for league of Rations Affairs should beauthorised to indicate, in reply to enquiries, that there had been no changeof policy on the part of Ris Majesty&apos;sGovernment, but that, pending a clearing up of the attitude of the various partiestowards the basis for discussion of peace,the question of fixing a date was not likely to arise.   Re should be careful,however, not to say that we would in no circumstances agree to oil sanctions atsome future date,    &quot;^he important thingfor him to secure was that during thecoming week there should be no date fixed for oil sanctions.    If circumstances should arise which brought the question once more to the front at Geneva, he should, try and arrange for it to be dealt with as a business proposition and ask for an investigation of the practicability ofrendering it efficacious, having infnindmore especially the uncertainty of effective
action by the United States of America.If he found himself in a position of difficulty he should communicate withSee note on &quot; ^page 11* London for1 further instructions .

The Minister for League of Nations affairs recalled, that at a Meeting of the Defence Policy and requirements Committee on December 6th he had raised the question of the further reinforcement of Tgypt .As at that moment, however, the position had been alittle easier, he had agreed to defer considered, action of  the matter until next week,    ^he situation inRgypt, however, had not improved, and he would beglad i^ the subject could be considered.    Tn replyto a question he said, the latest information was thatall parties were uniting against Nessim Pasha.The Prime Minister informed, the Cabinet thathe had already arranged for a Meeting of the defence policy and Requirements Committee on the morrow,Thursday, December 12th, at 5.30 p.m., and that thissubject was on the Agenda Paper.
^POSSIBILITYOKPO5. The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to thefact that during the next twenty-four hours at leastgi?CRF?ARYp staff.0t^f&amp;N officemqv: ABSENCE the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the Ministerfor League of Nations Affairs and the Permanent Tinder-Secret ary of State for Foreign Affairs would all be outof the country.    It was suggested that, in the absenceof the Secretary of State, the Permanent Under-Secret ary of Stabe ought to be present .The Prime Minister said that he himself had takenresponsibility for the Foreign Office d.uring theabsence of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.S / Sir Robert Vans ittart,on the following evening.   &amp;R^tho moanfed-^e- theParliamentary under-Secretary would act as intermediary between the Foreign Office and himself.
&quot;SmATTTS QUO&quot; IN 6. The Cabinet had before them the followingWE PACIFIC .  documents on the subject of the &quot;Status Quo&quot; in theArticle XIX0f the Pacific and the advantages or disadvantages to theWashingtonTreaty. United Kingdom of renewing Article XIX of theWashington Treaty:-(previous reference: A Note by the Secretary ( CP.-231 (35))Cabinet 48 covering a Report by the Chiefs of Staff(-35), Con- Sub-Committee, who had reached the&quot;elusion 9.) following Conclusion:-&quot;From the strategical point of view it would, we consider, be to our advantage to be no longer bound bythe atatus quo agreement, but theadvantage to us of its abrogation is dependent on a number of factors whichwe have referred, to above.    It is certain that if we are unable, for financial or other reasons, to placePong Kong in a state of defenceequivalent to that in which theJapanese will certainly place theirbases, then we shall stand to losemore than we shall gain.    If, on theother hand, it is decided that ArticleXIX,, amended to meet the needs of thepresent day, be retained, then westrongly urge that we should obtain some quid pro quo from Japan in other directions for the retention of that article as was done in 1922.&quot;The Note stated that the Sub-Committeeon Defence Policy and Requirements had considered the above Report, but, owingto the large political issues involved,affecting not only our position in theFar Fast but also that of the Common-wealth of Australia, and. the Dominion ofNew Zealand, the Sub-Committee recordedthe following Conclusions:-&quot;(i) That the questions, raised in theReport by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee on the &apos;Status Quo&apos;   inthe Pacific should be reserved forthe Cabinet owing to their importance,and placed on the Cabinet agenda for their next Meeting:(ii) To ask the Secretary or State forForeign Affairs and the Secretaryof State for Dominion affairs to arrange for Papers to be preparedgiving their considered views onthis matter for the informationof the Cabinet.&quot;A Memorandum by the Minister for Leagueof Nations Affairs (CP.-238 (35))containing an appreciation of thepolitical considerations involved inthe retention or otherwise of ArticleXIX of the Washington Treaty   furnishedin accordance with (ii) above   and
suggesting the following as perhaps thebest course to be pursued:-&quot;(l) At the appropriate moment, expressreadiness to prolong this provisionof the Washington Treaty, subject only to such modifications as maybe necessary to bring it up to date in view of the development of therequirements of air defence since1922 .(2)  If Japan demands modificationsunacceptable to us. they can be rejected with the knowledge thatwe shall not much mind if ArticleXIX disappears.    If Japan provesintractable, she must take the blame for the non-renewal of theArticle.(3)   In any ease, ascertain the viewsof the United States Delegation(who may have new instructions)before a definite decision is taken that it would be in our general interest, from a political as wellas from a strategical point of view,to allow these dispositions of the&quot;Washington Treaty to disappear.&quot;In the course of the discussion the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs reported that he had consulted the Australian and New Zealand Governmentswho had no strong views on the question.    He asked,however,  that if the subject did come up at the naval conference it should be discussed first with theBritish Commonwealth Delegations.Attention was also drawn to a telegram fromHis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Tokyo (No. 326) statingthat according to the newspaper &quot;Asahi&quot; Japan wasnot anxious to retain Article XIX of the washington treaty but would have no reason to object if itsretention was desired by the United States.      Thishowever, it was pointed out, might only reflect whatthe Japanese Government wished us to think.The Cabinet were reminded that we could onlyobtain strategical advantages from abandoningArticle XIX if it were possible to spend a good deal
of money on the defence of Hong Kong and that other-v/ise we should stand to lose more than we shouldgain.      In any event, there would probably have tobe some considerable expenditure on its defence.The Cabinet agreed:(a) That on balance the advantageappeared to lie in renewingArticle XIX of the hashingtonTreaty.(b) That we should endeavour to secure some compensation in exchange forits retention.(c) That if the question was raised at the Naval Conference, it shouldbe discussed with the BritishCommonwealth Delegations.

The Cabinet had before them the Report of aSub-Committee of the Supply Board (CP.-337 (35)),circulated to the Cabinet by direction of the PrimeMinister, dealing with the question of priority insupply on main items of Service requirements.    TheReport had been considered by the Sub-Committee on defence Policy and. Requirements on December 6th, whenthe following draft Conclusions were reached:-&quot;(a) To take note of a Report by a Sub-Committeeof the Supply Board on priority in supply to be given to the main items of service requirements in the event of a possibleaggression by Italy.

(e) That the Defence Departments, in consu.lt-ation with the Chairman of the SupplyEoar-1 and the Treasury, should make suchadditions to their respective staffs,whether for work in connection with thePrincipal Supply Officers Committee orinspection purposes^ as maybe necessaryfor expediting supplies in time of war.&quot;The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to the fact that the Terms of Reference of theSub-Committee of the Supply Board had been limitedto the question of priority in supply in the eventof a possible aggression by Italy.      Conclusion (c)of the Defence Policy and Requirements Sub-Committee,however, had been made to apply generally and theeffect of it was to allow the Government Departmentsconcerned to create a shadow armament industryover the whole field of armament supply.      Whilethe desirability of this was not specificallyquestioned, it was suggested that a decisiontoof such importance ought not/be taken except as partof the general review of Defence Requirements thatwas about to be undertaken.The Cabinet were informed, however, thatat the meeting of the Defence Policy and RequirementsSub-Committee the President of the Board of trade had opened up the larger question of supplies in timeof war, and that the discussion had shown thedifficulty of separating supplies for Italy and abyssinia entirely from the larger question ofsupplies generally.The Cabinet agreed:(a) To approve the recommendations ofthe Sub-Committee on Defence Policyand Requirements quoted above sofar as concerned preparation for apossible aggression by Italy,including the normal procedurespecified in (d) of those recommen-dations.
(b) That any difficulty arising in anyparticular case in separatingsupplies for the present emergencyfrom those required generally fora major war, should heresolved by the Treasury EmergencyExpenditure Committee.(c) That, subject to the above, the policyof the creation of a shadow armament industry should be reserved for con-side ration in connection with theThird Report of the Defence requirements committee.

In the arrest of armed, individuals, who,having sought refuge in a building orother place of vantage, might evadearrest with the aid. of fire-arras .(e)  In dealing with mobs and riots in caseswhere it would otherwise be necessaryto shoot .At the same time the Secretary of State proposed,with the approval of the Cabinet, to lay downconditions as to the training required by the! Policebefore the equipment was allowed to be used.After the Secretary of State for the colonies had asked the approval of his colleagues to the above proposals,The Secretary of State for India informed his colleagues that he had recently had a talk with sir Reginald Clarke who had had wide experienceof police work in India and who had been in theUnited States of America where he had studiedthe use of tear gas against crowds.      Sir Reginaldhad convinced him, and he h&amp;d?^s^B4^h*m-tre India-22-

The object of the meeting was to discussin a preliminary way, prior to the Cabinet meetingon the following day,  the line to be taken by theMinister for League of Nations Affairs at the forth-coning meeting of the Council of the League ofNations at Geneva,At the outset of the meeting the Minister for league of Nations Affairs gave an explanation whichhe had received from Sir Robert Vansittart as to thestatement published to the effect that no railwaywould be permitted from the coast port to beceded under the Paris proposals by Abyssinia to Italy,and a good deal of discussion took place on thispoint,,Subsequently the Minister for League ofNations Affairs handed round the draft of a statement the proposed to make at the opening of the council meeting (appendix),  and after considerable discussion the general lines of the draft were approved, subjectto some correction, for submission to the Cabinet,as the main heads of the discussion on both these points were discussed by the Cabinet on thefollowing morning and are included in a record ofthat meeting,  they are not summarised in thisrecord.
So The Home Secretary reported that Scotland Yard,had information that the Italian Pacist League proposed,to hold a meeting in the London Hippodrome on Sundayafternoon, December 29th, for the purpose of stimulatingvoluntary contributions from the Italian colony inEngland to assist Italy in her East African campaign.The Italian Ambassador was expected to speak.There was no power in the Executive in this countryto proclaim or prohibit a. lawful meeting.    ^Yie Policefelt able to handle the matter but could not guarantee that there would, not be a hostile demonstration in the streets or some incident, affecting individuals .The decision, however, turned on more than Policeconsiderations.    Supposing,  for example, that there-were a hostile demonstration against the italian ambassador, the connection of this with the inter-national situation was obvious .    There might even becounter demonstrations in Rome against british ubj e cts i n It aly .He suggested, therefore, that.- Signor Grandi shouldbe seen at once and informed that the Government ha^heard of this suggested, meeting but  took the view thatsuch a meeting was undesirable .    It was possible, ofcourse, that i&quot; pressure were brought on the italian ambassador to drop this meeting he might protest against meeting&quot;&apos; which were likely to take placeprotesting that  British policy ought not. to assist the aggressor and that Abyssinia should have our backing.The reply, however, would be that Signor Grandi&apos;smeeting might produce demonstrations of feeling whichwere undesirable and might injure friendly relationswith his country, but    a   League of Nations meeting-would, not produce such demonstrations and was part ofthe ordinary exercise of the rights of citizens in a free country.
Aft er a snort discussion  The Ministers approved the line proposedby the ^oine Secretary and invited him tosee Signor Grandi himself and explain whythe Government took the view that the.proposed. meeting was und esirahle .(&quot;he Ministers agreed that it was unnecessary to raise the point atthe Cabinet.)Whitehall  Gardens, S.Y.1,December 16, 193 K ,
A p f e N D I x.DRAFT QP STATEMENT TO BE MADE BY MR.   EDENAT GENEVA.Last November, as my colleagues will recall,when the Co-ordination Committee agreed upon certainsanctions which are now in force, it specifically, atthe same time, approved all attempts to find a basis ofdiscussion between the two parties to this dispute;and it particularly welcomed the suggestion that HisMajesty&apos;s Government and the French Government should seek to find such a basis.      It was, however, recognisedthat any proposals which these two Governments putforward must be acceptable to all three parties to thedispute, Abyssinia,  Italy and the League.It is clearly essential that approval should comefrom the League,      For the Members of the League are bound to respect, and to do their utmost to apply theCovenant.It was no easy tasit which the two Governmentsundertook, and, so far as His Majesty&apos;s Government areconcerned we had no illusion as to its difficulty.Indeed, it may well be maintained that it has proved to be at the present juncture of events an almost impossible task.      But, as I have said, with the good wishes of the Committee the two Governments made the attempt.It was proper that the attempt should be made,however invidious the task of those who had to make it.Even if this attempt has been unsuccessful the essentialimportance of conciliation remains, as the League hasfrequently recognised.      The principle therefore was right, even if its application in this instance hasnot availed.
It must &quot;be emphasised that the Paris proposalswhich were put forward last week were not advanced asproposals to he insisted on in any event.     They wereadvanced in order to ascertain what the views of thethree parties might he upon them, and HisMajesty&apos;s Government recommend them only for thispurpose.      If,  therefore,  it transpires that theseproposals which are no?/ before you do not satisfy the essential condition of agreement by the three parties, His Majesty&apos;s Government could not continueto recommend or support them.    In their minds thisparticular attempt at conciliation could not then he regarded as having achieved its object, and HisMajesty&apos;s Government for their part would not wish to pursue it further.
