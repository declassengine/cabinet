The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,after paying a tribute to the work in Paris of theMinister for League of Nations Affairs, who, he said,had acted in the letter and the spirit of the Cabinet&apos;policy and had conducted a difficult negotiation in thebest possible manner, gave an appreciation of theresults of the Paris meetings.     After describing theprocedure which was likely to be followed at Geneva in accordance with appropriate Articles of the Covenantand including the Resolutions adopted by the Assemblyof the League of Nations in 1921 as rules for guidancerecommended to the Council and the Members of theLeague in connection with the application of Article IS,he gave the Cabinet the benefit of his advice as tothe policy to be followed which was adopted subject tocertain modifications.The Cabinet then discussed the question in all   jits bearings, political (including British publicopinion), international, military and economic.The question of the procedure likely to be followed atGeneva was carefully investigated and the stage atwhich the question of Sanctions might arise, that is tosay, after war had broken out and the Council had madea report on the matter, received exhaustive study.The matter was discussed from the point of view of theprobable effectiveness of Sanctions which would dependon the attitude, first, of the nations members of theLeague of Nations, and,  second, on that of great nationslike the United States of America, Germany, Japan andBrazil which are not members of the League.      The re-actions of Sanctions on our own trade and finance andon native opinion in African Colonies (which would be adversely affected by the neglect to apply Sanctions,or if the Sanctions proved ineffective) were also taken
into account.     Their effect on Italian opinion, theremoterpossibility that they might precipitate somesudden action by Italy against British interests,  and their effect on the future relations between Italy and the UnitedKingdom were brought under reviewed/.In the course of&apos; the discussion many referenceswere made to the grave effects on our diplomacy of ourpresent military weakness.The Cabinet, who were most anxious if possibleto avoid a war with Italy which it was generally recognised would be a grave calamity, agreed:-(a) That the Delegates of the United Kingdom atthe forthcoming meetings at Geneva shouldbe authorised to reaffirm the statementsthat had been made in Parliament as to our intention to fulfil our Treaty obligations;(b) That they should keep in step with thepolicy of the French Government,  and, moreparticularly in the natter of Sanctions,they should avoid any commitment which france was not equally prepared to assume;(c) That they should have authority to make our policy in these respects clear at such tineand on such occasion as theymight deem to hebest;(d) That they should ain at following closely the procedure laid down in the Covenant(with the interpretations adopted by theAssembly in 1921) not in any quixotic spirit,and with due regard to the many difficulties.They should be careful to avoid trying to force nations to go further than they were willing, and generally should make it clearthat the question of Sanctions was one whichthe Members of the League had to examine inco-operation,  and with a view to collectiveaction.    They should be on their guard againstthe possibility that other nations night notin practice fulfil their co::&apos;nitnents;(e) That if war should break out between Italyand Abyssinia bringing the Council to the stage where Sanctions had to be considered,the United Kingdom Delegates should be
particularly careful to keep in touchwith Ministers in London.(f) That the usual latitude should be givento the Representatives of the UnitedKingdom as to the manner in which theycarried out their task which was recognised to be one of peculiardifficulty.
ySSlNIA-Supply ofIns to.ftpeviouGleference:Satinet 41 (35)Conclusion l).2.      The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that the negotiations with other countries on the question of issuing licences for the exportationof arms and munitions of war to Abyssinia had cometo nothing, and the question, therefore, arose as towhether the Cabinet should change their policy.The subject was discussed at some length.In favour of withdrawing the embargo onlicences it was pointed out that public opinion inthis country was strongly moved on the subject.Several of the political leaders, whom the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs had consulted on thegeneral question of Abyssinia, had been in favour of withdrawing the embargo.      In addition,native opinion in the African Colonies was stated to be critical of the policy of refusing licences, considering itas a policy which favoured Italy who is largely self-dependent in the matter of war material, anddetrimental to Abyssinia who was notoriously ill-armed.      The continuance of the policy would increase this criticism.      The same might apply to some extent in India.      Signor Mussolini would, it was suggested,treat the continuance of the policy as a further sign of weakness.      British ships were known to betransporting arms from other countries to Djibouti,and it was suggested that our policy would be regardedas inconsistent if we still refused to grant licences.In favour of continuing to refuse licences,it was pointed out that if we changed our policy we should be the only large country that had raised the embargo.     M. Laval had told Mr. Eden in Paristhat the French Government did not intend to changeits policy.      Although M. Laval had not objected to
a suggestion that we might change our policy, the&quot;by cabinet was strongly moved/the consideration thatit was undesirable within a fortnight of themeeting at Geneva to adopt a different policy from France in this   matter, more especially as our general policy was to act with the French.    It wassuggested also that to grant licences for theexport of war material, even though such grant wouldbe allowed to both countries, might serve as a pretext,  if Signor Mussolini was looking for one,for an Italian coup-de-main against British interests,A change of policy would not really benefitAbyssinia as she could not pay for any considerable quantities of arms.      Moreover, before arms could reach her it was not improbable that hostilitiesmight break out in which case Italy would beentitled to exercise right of search.      As regardsnative opinion in the African Colonies,  it wassuggested that if the embargo were taken off andarms did not reach Abyssinia, or if hostilitiesbroke out and the arms were intercepted by theItalians, the effect would be even worse thancontinuing the present policy.      It was suggestedalso that a change of policy would convey an impression that we had abandoned all hope of apacific issue of the Italo-.Abyssinian dispute -though the Cabinet recognised that there was nolonger much prospect of a pacific issue.      It was stated that even if licences were granted, therewas not likely to be any rush for them on thepart of manufacturers who were dubious of gettingpayment.
During the meeting the Suonatary of JSt^ofor Foreign Affairs announced that he hapV^ustreceived a telegram from Abyss inijx-^tTo the effectthat an Italian Vice-Consxh^^who happened to bethe son-in-law of th-e^British Minister at addis ababa, hac^J^,ehshot in the chest by an Abyssinianand thi--s^was felt to render inopportune an immediateOn balance, the Cabinet agreed:(a) That no change in policy should bemade at present0(b) That in the overt of some new factorarising -which rendered d&amp;undesirable are-examination of the question, theSecretary of State for Foreign affairs should bring the matter before theCabinet Committee referred to in thefinal Conclusion..NOTE:      For the announcement to be made inrespect of&quot; this matter, see Conclusion 5.The Cabinet adjourned for an hour and a halfat this point.

The Cabinet had. before them a Memorandum bythe Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee  (CP.  166 (35))covering a Report by the Joint Planning Sub-Committeeindicating defence measures which would be required if it appeared likely that Italy intended to takethe bit between her teeth.        This Memorandum hadbeen prepared in accordance with directions givenby a Conference of Ministers held on the 6th August,1935,  (CP.  159 (35).Naval Measures.After indicating certain comparatively unobtrusivemeasures which the admiralty the Sub-Committee summariseding points for which Cabinetnecessary:(a)were taking(para. 5)(para 6) the follow-authority would be At-.-.&apos;-&apos;The present programme of the Home Fleetis to leave its Home ports on 9th Sept-ember and cruise in British waters -this programme is common knowledge.Unless after the discussion with Francenext week there is no chance of action being required against Italy, the Admiraltypropose that the Home Fleet shall leave their Home Ports as soon as the leaveperiod is over (August 29th), and concentrate at Portland ready to sail forGibraltar and certain units to join the   .Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean.In order that this may be done it would benecessary to inform the Fleet by23rd August and certain earlier steps inconnection with particular vessels wouldhave to be taken as soon as possible -these earlier steps would not necessarilycause much comment.It has been shown that in the event of serious action against Italy it would benecessary to complete the Home and mediterranean Fleets to full complementand to bring forward the Reserve Fleet.This involves mobilisation which processtakes about 7 days and would inevitablycause much comment.      The Admiralty, how-ever, attach great importance to an early decision to mobilise should the situationbecome menacing, as until this is doneall Naval measures must be incomplete.Army Measures.The Sub-Committee recommended that authority should be given -(c) to despatch anti-aircraft guns, search-lights, personnel and ammunition to malta and Aden,  (para. 7):(b)
(1) to move two additional Battalionsto Malta,  (para. 10):Air Force Measures.The Sub-Committee recommended that authority should be given -(e) to place the reinforcing air contingent on a mobile basis,  (para, ll):(f) to collect and despatch certain supplies to selected bases,  (para.  11):GeneralThe Sub-Committee particularly desired -(g) to call attention to the general strate-psychological  situation which might arise asthe consequence of war against Italy,(para. 13):(h) to emphasise the following statement in the Joint Planning Sub-Committee^Report,(para.  14)  -&quot;At least two months&apos; notice isrequired before all our forcescan be considered as able effectively to co-operate ..... on a war basis&quot;.(i) to stress that the moral and politicalco-operation of Prance were not sufficientand that her assured military support,concerted with Great Britain, beforethe League Council meeting on the 4thSeptember next, was essential,  (para. 16).The First Lord of the i-idmiralty, the Secretary ofState for War and the Secretary of State for Air madestatements to the Cabinet as to the various proposals affecting their respective Departments.On the question of naval measures the Cabinet were informed that from the point of view of foreign policyit was considered desirable to reinforce theMediterranean Fleet at as early a date as possible.The Cabinet were strongly opposed to mobilisation of reserves either from the Wavy or Army if this couldbe avoided, owing to the resounding effect it wouldhave on public opinion both at home and abroad.
(The First Lord of the Admiralty left the cabinet room for a short time to consult the first sea Lord and the Chief of the Naval Staff by telephone as to whether, from a technical point of view 5, it was feasible and desirableto make the dispositions proposed withoutmeasures of mobilisation sufficient tobring the complements of the mediterranean fleet and Home Fleet up to full strength).After considerable discussion the cabinet agreed:-Naval dispositions.(a) That the Admiralty should be authorisedto arrange for the Home Fleet to con-cent rate on August o9th and to proceedsouth to the Mediterranean.      Thegeneral trend of the discussion at theCabinet favoured Gibraltar rather thanMalta as the destination of the HomeFleet9 but it was agreed that if theNaval Staff desired some other dis-position they should re-open the question.(b) That the Mediterranean Fleet should be reinforced at the same time as theHome Fleet proceeds south by such forces as the Admiralty might deem desirable,the general character of which was indicated to the Cabinet by the FirstLord of the Admiralty.(c) That the Admiralty should have authorityto keep the Mediterranean Fleet at Maltauntil August 29th, and thereafter to sendit to the eastern Mediterranean.(d) That the First Lord of the admiralty should be authorised to notify theCommander-in-Chief of the Mediterraneanof the decision recorded in (c)  above,and to instruct him not to rig the anti-submarine boom at Malta.(e) That the whole of the above should besubject to the decision that thereshould be no mobilisation of naval re-serves at the present time or until further Cabinet authority was obtained.Royal Air Force measures.(f) That the Secretary of State for air should be authorised to arrange for fivesquadrons of the Royal Air Force in theMiddle East Command each to be increasedby six aircraft and six pilots from home.This would involve sending- some thirtyfirst-line aircraft as well as a certainnumber of reserve machines (including somebombers and some, fighters) to the middle east Command.      This would be an un-obtrusive measure, as the aircraft wouldbe shipped at Birkenhead, from which portfrequent shipments are made.
(g) That in addition the secretary of Statefor Air should he authorised to send a squadron of aircraft to Malta if theAdmiralty should so desire.Anti-aircraft guns and searchlights for Malta.(h) That the question of sending additionalanti-aircraft guns and searchlights,with the necessary personnel (not involving mobilisation), to Malta shouldhe remitted for decision to the CabinetCommittee referred to below inConclusion 6.       The Committee was in-invited to consider with the Chiefs ofStaff whether it was worth while toincrease the armament of an island soexposed as is Malta to attaclc from Italy.Battalions for Malta.(i) That additional battalions should not besent to Malta if this involved the calling up of reserves for them.(3) That if the Secretary of State for war should wish to contemplate the despatch to Malta of any force of infantry withoutreserves he should bring the matter before the Cabinet Committee referredto in Conclusion (h)  above, which would examine it inter alia from the samepoint of view as in the case of guns andsearchlights.
ABYSSINIA.    4.     The Home Secretary raised the question of whatwould he the position, if war were to break out betweenThe flyingof Italian   Italy and Abyssinia, as to the flying of Italianaeroplanesacross aeroplanes over Egypt.Egypt.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affaireundertook to send the Hone Secretary a note on thesubject.
ABYSSINIA. 5.      The Cabinet were informed, that their meetingPublic had. occasioned very great public interest,  and thatannouncement.the Press would be particularly insistent on&apos;receiving some notification of what had beendiscussed.After consideration the Cabinet agreed:- i(a) That the News Department of the ForeignOffice should see the Press in accordancewith their usual practice, and that theSecretary of State for Foreign affairs should see individually the representa-tives of certain selected papers;(b) That the public announcement should beto the effect that no further develop-ments are to be expected during thenext few days, and. that no further meeting of the Cabinet has been fixed.Certain Ministers who will be in London,or within reach, will be available tomeet and. deal with any points which may require decision.    It should be addedthat the Cabinet had. received a reporton the Paris Conversations.    No changein Government policy had been made fromthat adopted, at the Paris Conference,or as regards the League of Nations, orin the matter of the issue of licences for the exportation of arms and. munitions of war.

Ministers had before them a draft Note (Appendix)to the French Ambassador, prepared in reply to theFrench request, for an assurance regarding the futureBritish attitude in the event of a resort to force inFurope or of an infraction of the Covenant by another european Pow er.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS explain-ed that his Note was based on his own speech at theLeague Assembly on September 11th,. 1935, and repeated the declarations he then made in other language.T.FIF LORD RRRSIDW^ OF THE COUNCIL,  as a generalobservation, thought that the Note set forth our view with rather too much warmth, and that some of thephrases were susceptible of a diversity of meaning.He quoted as an illustration a sentence in the revisedp aragra ph 5, viz.:-&quot;That policy seems, moreover, to be theonly one consonant with the fulfilment of the obligations  contained in theCovenant,  obligations which were deliberately given the most solemnform and. title and made to over-ruleall other international obligations,and consequently it is difficult toconceive of future Governments adopt-ing a different policy.&quot;A. French critic might say &quot;What about Japan?&quot;    Hethought the passage was sound in substance but was rather too enthusiastic in expression.TFF HOMF SFORFTARY said it was open to the commentthat the whole Paper had to do with a resort to forcein Europe, as was made clear in the first paragraph.THE LORD PRESIDENT pointed out that the Governmentwas not emphasising that point, but that the Covenantincluded Japan.THE SECRETARY OF S^AfE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat if the Note was confined, to Europe, other countries outside of Furope, including the Dominions, would beupset.    In reply to the Chancellor of the Exchequer
he thought the passage had. been interpolated in orderto emphasise that while the present Government couldonly pledge itself., the outburst of public opinion showed that other Governments would in all probability do thesame.THE CFANCRLLOt? OF THE EXOPPQUKP, pointed  out thatthat was in the original draft.    **e thought the lord president&apos;s idea was worth considering.THE HOME SPORT?&quot; ARY asked what was the matter withthe original draft?The Secretary of State -for ForeignAffairs undertook to look at thispassage again and to consider the observations of his colleagues .THE HOME SECRETARY thought the passage was perhaps a little out of place.   Paragraph 5 really addresseditself to a particular difficulty, namely, that all british Governments were likely to pursue the samepolicy.    It seemed a little inconsistent to introduce the phrase about the policy being the only one inconsonance with the fulfilment of the engaments.gementscontained in the Covenant.^HP LORD PRESIDENT said it was all right to saythat we spoke for the present Government and the presentpublic opinion, but he thought it was rather dangerous to speak of future Governments and public opinion.171TJF: SECRETARY OF SmATP FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat, if he did not say that, he would be in a ratherdifficult position.    His argument was that the Covenantwas shown, by the outburst of public opinion, to have greater validity in this country that. had. been thought.TFF PRIME MINISTER thought this point, was important.Ministers agreed that the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs should look into the matter again.
Page I, Para.2.THE SFCRRfARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSaccepted a suggestion of the Poire Secretary to substi-tute the word &quot;embodied&quot;for the word &quot;enshrined&quot; (fourlines from the bottom of page 1) .THE LORD PRFSTDFN&quot;1 felt some doubt about the sentence at the bet em of page 1,  &quot;had appealed withgrowing force to the strain of idealism in the British-character&quot;.   That was all right in a personal speech,but he doubted its advisability in a diplomatic document.mhe phrase savoured rather of self-praise.fRP SECRETARY OF ST AT?) ^OR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said he would think this phrase over, but he pointed out thatin this paragraph he was merely recalling what he had said at Geneva.   pe was% therefore, rather in favour ofadhering to the passage.&quot;&quot;HE PRTf/F MINISTER said he himself had not atfirst realised how closely this paragraph did followSir Samuel ^oare&apos;? original speech,TFT7 ShCRF^APY OF Sm at FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat this document ought to be read with his speech.Paragraph 4.&quot;HF HOME SFGRF^ARY drew attention to the words&quot;for I think it will be generally agreed, that no member of the League could lay down its policy with greater clarity and decision in advance ofany particular case which would bring that policyinto consideration, as in the present case, withall its fellow members at Geneva&quot;.Fe had no object ion to thet phrase, but he doubted whether, after saying that he had already laid, down thepolicY with clarify and decision, it was advisable inthe next sentence to say &quot;to avoid all possiblemisunderstanding I would demonstrate this point with further precision&quot;.After some discussion it was agreed, to alter the latter phrase to read as follows:-&quot;Your Excellency win observe that Ispoke, as I am now writing, of allacts of unprovoked aggression&quot;.
It was agreed to substitute for the phrase &quot;but is concerned with a principle of int.ernationalconduct to which it will hold with firm,enduring and universal persistence&quot;, thefollowing words:-&quot;but is concerned with a genera! principleof international conduct to which it willfirmly hold so long as the League remainsan effective body&quot;.Paragraph 5 (p--y&apos;e 4) :It wr-s agreed,  for the words  &quot;will not lightlyinvalidate itself by lack of faith in. and effective action on behalf of, its own ideals&quot;,to substitute -&quot;will not render itself impotent by lackof faith in and. refusal of effective action on behalf of its own ideals&quot;&apos;.mhe Secretary of State for Foreign affairs undertook to examine the sentence &quot;HisMajesty&apos;s Government have no doubt thatthis will prove to be the case&quot;, in orderto make sure that the meaning was quite clear, namely, that His Fajestyfs Governmenthad no doubt that the League would, remain ane f f e c t iv e b o d y.i*FE LORD PRFSIDFNm suggested that the Secretaryof State should guard against the charge of self-praise.tthp ST?CHFmARY OF SmA?E FOP FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat the main object in the drafting had been, withoutextending what he had said at Geneva, to give satisfaction to the French and to opinion at home, and he and his advisers hoped that this would be the case.tehali Gardens, S,W;1epteroher 83, 1935.
DRAFT NOTE TO FRENCH AMBASSADOR.FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.I.September     , 1935.Your Excellency,In the enquiry which you were so good as to address toSir Robert Vansittart on September 10th Your Excellencyexpressed the desire of your Government, in connection with thepresent dispute between Italy and Abyssinia, to learn to what extent they might be assured in the future of the immediate and effective co-operation of this country in the event of a violation of the Covenant of the League of Nations and a resort to force in Europe;   and you referred in particular to the eventuality of a resort to force in Europe on the part of some european State, whether or not that State might be a Memberof the League of Nations.3.        I have the honour, in reply, to invite your attentionto the words which I used in the course of my speech to theLeague Assembly at Geneva on September 11th,   I then declaredthat His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom would besecond to none in their intention to fulfil, within the measureof their capacity, the obligations which the Covenant laysupon them?   and I added that the ideas enshrined in theCovenant, and in particular the aspiration to establish the rule of law in international affairs, had appealed with growingforce to the strain of idealism in the British nationalcharacter, and that they had indeed become a part of thenational conscience.SxcellencyMonsieur Andre Charles Gorbin,
5*       as Tour Excellency will also recollect, X furthertook the opportunity la the course&apos; of -ay speech at Geneva to repudiate any suggestion that the attitude of His Majesty*sGovernment had been one of other than unwavering fidelity tothe league and all that it stands fo% and X drew attentionto the fact that the recent response of public opinion inthis country showed hot? completely the nation supported theQov&amp;rmmnt in the lull acceptance of the obligations of Leaguemembership, which was the oft proclaimed keynote of british foreign policy^   I added that to suggest or insinuate thatthis policy was for some reason peculiar to the italo-Abyssiaian conflict Would be a complete misunderstandingsnothing could in fact he further from the truths   X said,and I sincerely welcome this opportunity to repeat with full responsibility, that it is to the principles of the League,and not to any particular manifestation thereof, that theBritish nation had demonstrated its adhereaea*   Any otherview would at once he an underestimate of British good faith and an imputation upon British sincerity.   In conformitywith its precise and explicit obligations I pointed out,and I re-emphaeise, that the League staadftf and this countrystands with it, for the collective maintenance of theCovenant in its entirety, H^Ja^^^^^^J^ PPloolleetive resistance to all sjsts of -unBrovolced .&amp;ggjg&amp;saiiaSs4*       I would draw Tour BscelleaeyJ e particular attentionto this last senteneef   for i think it trill &quot;foe generally agreed that no seiaber of the League could lay down its policy with greater clarity and decision in advance ofany particular ease which would bring that policy intoconsideration, as in the present case, with all its fellowmembers at Genev&amp;*   To avoid all possible misunderstandingi will demonstrate this point with further precision.   Xspoke, and am writing, of all acts of unprovoked aggression^
Haeh word in that sentence jg&amp;st have its fall value.It is at once evident, for example5 that not only my there be degrees of culpablli ty as there aTO tegfeti of aggression,but also that procedure which would be appropriate as regardsthe positive act of unprove&amp;ed aggression wemM notnecessarily be appropriate as regards the negative act ofthe failure to fulfil the terms of a treaty.   I im&amp;er-stand that your Gevesssae?at already recognises thesedistinctions.   And similarly in regard to treaty obligations it is pertinent to recall that, as i havealready said at Geneva, elasticity is a part of security,and that every Member of the Xteague ist  recognise, as thecovenant itself recognises-., that the world is not- static.6*        it it he suggested that this declaration or supportfar the principles of the Covenant ezsbodied In iay recentspeech at Geneva, and reaffirmed in the present noterepresents only the policy of Ills Majesty*s present government, md not necessarily that of their successorsin office*oe, I may point out that, while my ^mr&amp;B at Genevawere in fact spoken on behalf of the present Governmentof this country, those words were also spoken with the over-whelming support -sad approval of the British nation,    hatpolicy sodas, moreover^ to be the only one consonant withthe fulfilment of the obligations contained in the Covenant,obligations which were deliberately given the mast soleniform and title, and made- to overrule all other inter-national obligations, m&amp; consequently it Is difficultto conceive of future Oovemmeats adopting a. differentpolicy,   as i stated at Geneva, - and as has since become increasingly evident, the attitude of the British nationin the last few weeks has clearly demonstrated the factthat it is sieved by no variable and unreliable sentimentbut is eoaeemed with a principle of international conductto which it will hold with firm, enduring end universal.
