THS COAL MININGINDUSTRY.OrganisationofInterim Reportof Committee.(previous reference cabinet 45(35), Con-clusion 9) .FA7,In pursuance of the Conclusion mentionedin the margin,  the Cabinet met to consider an interim Report (Paper CP.  160(35)) by theCommittee on the Organisation of the Coal MiningIndustry, which had been appointed by the Cabineton 8th May, 1935 (Cabinet 26 (35) Conclusion 4)to examine memoranda by the President of the Boardof Trade (Papers CP.  1S9 (34)  and CP.  77 (35))covering Reports of an Inter-DepartmentalCommittee.    These Reports recommended the adoptionof a policy of unification of coal mining Royaltiesas a step towards increasing efficiency in theindustry and facilitating gradual concentration.In their Report the Cabinet Committeeexpressed the view that the broadest issues ofprinciple must be decided before the committee could give detailed consideration to the questions raised in the Inter-Departmental Committee&apos;sReports, and after summarising the presentposition and the principal arguments for and against nationalisation of Royalties, and drawing attention to certain other aspects of coal policy,the Committee submitted to the Cabinet the follow-ing questions for decision:-(l)  Is the Government prepared to foster -not necessarily by compulsion - a policyof concentration in spite of theprobable effect on numbers employed?(2)  If so, is the Government prepared to approve the unification of Royaltiesin principle as its contribution tothis policy?In this event it is suggested that theCommittee should be authorised toprepare a detailed scheme, draft aBill and open negotiations withrepresentatives of the Royalty Owners.-1-
(3)  Is the proposal of the Secretary for mines that a Royal Commission heappointed, to consider and report on matters of Health and Safety in theMining Industry approved?(4) May the Committee he authorised toconsider the relation of the Consettdecision to the royalties problem whendrafting a Royalties Bill?and suggested that any decisions on the above matters should he embodied in due course in a generalpronouncement of Government policy in regard to coal.At the request of the Prime Minister, the Secretaryfor Mines explained that the situation in the coal-mining industry was somewhat different from theposition in July last, when the Interim Report ofthe Cabinet Committee (CP.-160 (35)) had been drawnup.   The Cabinet Committee had experienced some  ,difficulty in reaching conclusions on the questions raised in the Reports of the Inter-DepartmentalCommittee because those questions had. raised important matters of principle on which no decisions had yetbeen taken.    Accordingly, the Committee had decided,that their Interim Report should cover the wholeground of coal policy., including certain aspectsof that policy which the Cabinet Committee had notexamined,The first question was whether the policy under-lying Part II of the Coal Mines Act, 1930, stillstood.   The Coal Mines Re-organisation commission had begun by endeavouring to stimulate voluntaryamalgamation, with disappointing results.   TheCommission had. then resorted to the compulsoryprovisions of the Act;   but the first case brought before the Railway and Canal Commission had been rejected by that Court, and if a similar fate befellthe second, case, which the Commission was about toput before the Court, it would seem that the provi-sions of   Part II of the Act were really unworkable.-2-
Great difficulty would be experienced in obtainingfrom Parliament more drastic powers than the Commissionalready possessed, and it might be preferable to turn to a policy of concentration in the coal-miningindustry, the Government&apos;s contribution to whichmight take the form of the unification of miningroyalties.   It should, be clearly understood that inthe opinion of the Commission one important obstaclein the way of re-organisation was not the private ownership of royalties, but rather the multiplicityof royalty owners.   The savings to be&quot; secured fromthe grouping of pits and the concentration, of produc-tion on. some pits would be outweighed by the dead,rents payable on the pits which would not be used:while in other cases special clauses in the leasesrequiring coal &quot;to be worked diligently&quot; interfered,with the advantages to be secured by amalgamation.The outlines of the scheme for the acquisition of mining royalties were set out in Paper C.P.-77 (35).The second proposal of the Cabinet Committee wasthat a Royal Commission should be appointed to consider and report upon matters of health and safety in themining indtjs try .The third proposal was that the relation of theConsett decision to the royalties problem should betaken into consideration when a Royalties Bill wasdrafted,Since July the miners had been conducting a campaign throughout the districts for a 2/- rise in wages and. demanding that the owners should meet themnationally for the discussion of wages.   The miners-contended that it would be easy for the owners to find the necessary money if the industry re-organised itselfunder the existing statutory powers.
From enquiries which had heen made it seemed probable that,  if a ballot was taken, the minerswould vote for a stoppage and would leave workgenerally in most if not all districts.This new development opened a further possibleline of policy, based on a generally accepted viewthat up to the present the industry had failed to do what it should have done in the way of internalreconstruction.      This policy would be one ofinsisting on the industry organising Central SellingSchemes by districts with some central supervisionby the industry.      The Governments policy might therefore be threefold:    unification of royalties toassist in amalgamations, etc., for the best economicway of working the pitBj    a Royal Commission to find the safest way of working: the pit si    central sellingto ensure the best price of the product of the pitsin order to improve the financial proceeds of theindustry to the joint advantage of masters and men.This was the present position, though it was much complicated by the serious troubles which had broken out in South Wales in the last few days.In the course of some discussion as to the timewhen a threatened stoppage might materialise, theCabinet were reminded of the grave difficulties whichwould result from a complete stoppage in the coal-fields in the winter months, owing to the impractica-bility of maintaining foreign supplies of coal forgas and other public utility undertakings.      In thisconnection the view was expressed that, while no doubt the men would leave work, the great majority of them
were opposed to a stoppage, and if they could heencouraged by action on the part of the Governmentand the owners, the demand for a stoppage would, bemuch weakened.The President of the Board of Trade informed the Cabinet that on the present occasion the owners had appeared to have forfeited any claim to public sympathy   by their failure to use their statutory powers.      He had. that morning informed Sir hvanWilliams that a grave view was taken of the position,and had urged that the owners should themselves atonce take prompt steps to put their selling organisa-tion in order, unless they did so they must expectno sympathy or support from the Government, which inthat event would certainly have to consider takingdrai-tic action of a nature which would be verydisagreeable to the owners.      Sir Evan Williams washimself impressed by this warning, arid it was hopedthat he would impress upon his colleagues, whom hewas meeting that day, the very grave view taken bythe Government of the position.After some further discussion the cabinet agreed, to examine first the proposal for the unification of royalties in (2) of the summary onpage 5 of Paper CP.-160 (35),
The principal objections raised to the adoptionin principle of this proposal were as follows:-The proposal meant the nationalisation of that part of the land containing coalmeasures and would constitute a dangerous precedent.    It was not unreasonable toask that those in favour of this drasticchange should fully establish their case.This, it was suggested, had. not been done.In former days the proposal had beenadvocated on the ground that the minerswould work more happily if the royalties-were in the hands of the State and notin those of private individuals.   this argument was no longer used,   The minersnow demanded that the benefit of theroyalties should, go direct to the industrys o as to enable wages to be increased.It had also been urged   notably by theSamuel Commission, that private ownershipimpeded the full exploitation of our coalresources.   This contention, however, hadbeen disposed of by the enactment of theFines Working Facilities legislation.There remained the argument that private ownership impeded Rationalisation byselective working.    It was recognisedthat this point must he met, and thatnationalisation of royalties was one way of meeting it, although it was notthe only way.Private enterprise was preferable toState enterprise.   mhe former had been,mainly responsible for developing thecoal industry,  and,  in doing so, hadtaken risks which ho Government couldface.   From the point of view of the efficient conduct of the industry theproposal, was a retrograde step.It would also be a retrograde step sofar as concerned the relations betweenowners and miners.   At present it couldtruthfully be said&apos; that when the G-overn-ment mediated in mining disputes it did so with complete impartiality.   If theproposal was adopted this would cease to be the case and the Government wouldbecome an interested party in everymining dispute and its impartiality would,aIways be suspe ct,There would be pressure which in practice it would be Impossible to resist fromminers, owners and public opinion to cancel royalty payments so as to faeili-tate the settlement of a dispute.    It-would not be long before this happened,and then the interest on the Stockwould become a charge on the exchequer .
Royalties varied from 2d. to 1/- &quot; ton.So long as this was the result ofbargaining between individuals, no serious harm was done:   but when, theState became the royalty owner therewould be pressure for uniformitythroughout the country, which, inpractice, would, mean that the presentminimum royalty woultf become thestandard, with&apos; very serious losses tothe Exchequer.In the coalfields the position was ofteneased by the fact that the ownership ofthe surface and of the sub-surface wasin the same person.   Under the proposalsconflict of ownership would arise betweenthe State underground and the privateowner- on the surface.   there would beendless friction and trouble on theclaims in respect of subsidence,  etc.The political reaction&quot;1  of the proposal might be very great..   In particular,Conservative&apos; opinion would be seriously disturbed, and It was very Important thatthe Government should do nothing to dampthe enthusiasm of its Conservativesupporters.   Widespread apathy andabstention from voting were to be feared, and might well result from awrong decision of policy on this matter.The basis of acquisition proposed wasinherently unjust.    A lump sum was tobe named, in the Act, and the owners were to fight among themselves fortheir share.    If royalties were to be nationalised it should be done on thebasis always adopted in the past, namely,the value in each, case should.be settledas between the State and. the individualowner.   Incidentally, this particularaspect of the scheme would make it verymuch more difficult to carry the scheme into effect .A possible alternative policy would, beto adopt the view of the Scottish courts in the Garron Company case, and of LordJustice Greer in the Cone ett case, and allow the Courts to give relief in easeswhere they are satisfied that the rentreserved or other financial terms of amining lease are impeding the most efficient and economical working ofthe coal.
On the other hand, the following arguments wereadvanced in favour of the proposal:-Private enterprise is not invariablypreferable to State enterprise.   Rachcase must be considered and settled onits merits.   This wss a case similar in character to what had been done whenthe Port of London Authority, the Centra3Electricity Board and the London. passenger transport Board were set up.The unification of royalties actuallyproposed, was not in fact nationalisation,nor was it open to the objections tonationalisation of land, and other similarproposals.   The kernel of the present scheme was unification of ownership, inthe absence of which it would be impossibleto secure any satisfactory reorganisation of the mining industry.The Working Facilities legislation wasnot a complete solution, and a reversal of the Cons ett judgment&apos;would not meetthe case.   Amalgamations and the most effective working of coal were held upbecause of multiplicity of ownership,and concentration and. regulation were required, and. could only be obtained ifunification of ownership was first secured.This was an essential step towards therest of the Government&apos;s raining policy.The development of the mining indusrty was due to risks taken, not by royalty owners, but by those who had been actuallyresponsible for the working of the coal.The principal oblections to nationalisation of royalties were avoided in the proposed,scheme by the royalties being transferrednot to the State but to an independent body similar in character and status tothe Central Electricity Board.    It was difficult to see how press tire could, beput on such a body to surrender theroyalties.   This would also meet thedifficulty which had been raised aboutreadjustment of royalty rates.The Conservative attitude towards theproposal would depend upon how it was presented ,   If they were wise, royal 113/owners should welcome the opportunityof exchanging a precarious and specula-tive investment for a gilt-edged one.The scheme could only be carried out onthe basis of cheap money, and the present was a very favourable moment from thispoint of view, and one which might neverrecur.The method proposed, for settling compensa-t ion was the only one which would be practicable and fair and reasonable toall the parties, for the reasons fullygiven in Section 3 of the Inter-DepartmentalCommittee^ Second Report (CP.-77 (35)).
In the cours e of discussion the Cabinet were informed that no compensation would be payable for coal which had no present value,   The view was expressed that before any final decision was reached with regard to the proposed method of compensationthe matter should be discussed with the royalty owners.If those owners as a whole were hostile to the scheme the position might require reconsideration.The Chancellor of the Fx chequer emphasised thatany discussion with the owners must be on the basis that the total sum payable in compensation must hespecified in the Act and. should not be arrived, at byaggregating the separate valuations of individualproperties,    ^his condition was vital and. fundamentalto the s eh erne .entration The Cabinet were informed that a policy of can-centration was bound to result in. some displacementof labour.-.    If, however, no action were taken,nnemployment in the coalfields would grow steadilyworse as the industry progressively decayed.    Concen-tration on a voluntary basis should be encouraged asmuch as possible.   Attention was particularly drawn to the important consideration in (d) on page 2 ofC.P.-160 (35):-n(d) that if the process- of displacement isgradual,  it can be dealt -with to a con-siderable extent by arrangements for thetransfer of labour,, restrictions onrecruitment and similar measures .   Work-sharing schemes might be helpful.&quot;Some discussion took place as to when and howtbe announcement of the Governments policy should bemade.   General agreement was expressed with the viewthat publication     . should not be unduly delayed,and that the statement of policy should be as coropre-hensive as possible, and should include a reference tothe setting up of Central Selling Schemes. The cabinet were informed&apos;that it was improbable that there wouldbe any opportunity to make an announcement of policyin Parliament before Prorogation..   Such an announce-raent could, however, be made immediately thereafter,either in a broadcast address which1 the Prime minister was to deliver or in the Prime Minister&quot;s election manifesto.
The Cabinet agreed :(as regards the points set out on Page 5of the Cabinet Committee&apos;s Interim Report(CP,  160 (35))(1)   (a) That  the Government are pre/pared to fosternot necessarily by compulsion - apolicy of concentration, in spite ofthe probable effect on numbers employed,,It being assumed that concentration ona voluntary basis will continue to be encouraged as much as possible.(b)  To take note with approval of the viewof the Inter-Departmental Committee&quot;that if the process of displacementis  gradual,it can be dealt with to aconsiderable extent by arrangementsfor the transfer of labour, restrictionson recruitment5 and similar measures.Work-sharing schemes might be helpful&quot;.(2) To approve the unification of Royalties inprinciple as the Governments contributionto this policy, and to authorise the CabinetCommittee to prepare a detailed scheme,draft a Bill and open negotiations withrepresentatives of the Royalty Owners.(3) To approve the proposal of the Secretaryfor Mines that a Royal Commission shouldbe appointed to consider and report on matters of Health and Safety in the Mining-Industry, with Terms of Reference somewhaton the following lines : -&quot;To consider whether the changes in organisation and methods of work,and the results of research intomatters of safety, make it. desirablethat the principles or general provisionsof the Coal Mines Act, 1911, should beextended or modified, and to make recommendations,&quot;(4) To authorise the Cabinet Committee toconsider the relation of the Consettdecision to the Royalties problem whendrafting a Royalties Bill.The Cabinet also agreed :(l) To accept in principle, as part of theGovernments coal policy,  the setting upof Central Selling schemes by districts,with possibly some central supervision,by the industry as a whole;    and to approve the action taken by the President of theBoard of Trade in communicating to SirEvan Williams the views of the Governmentin regard to this matter.
(2) That a comprehensive statement of theGovernment&apos;s coal policy coveringinter alia unification of Royalties,the appointment of the Royal Commission,and the setting up of Central Sellingschemes,  should he announced in the nearfuture,  and that it should he left tothe Prime Minister to decide theoccasion for this announcement and the precise form which it should take.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I.,15th October, 1935.
