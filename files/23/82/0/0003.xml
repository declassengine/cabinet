mHE NAVAL 1.   The Prime Minister informed his colleaguesRRVIEW.that, in order to enable those members of the Cabinetl   (Previous who desired to be present at the Fleet ExercisesReference&quot;Cabinet 24 to be held on the day following the Naval Review,(35), Con-elusion 11.)     the weekly Meeting of the Cabinet would be postponedfrom Wednesday, July 17th, to Thursday, July 18th.He anticipated that on Tuesday, July 16th, the MinesVote would be put down for the House of Commons .In order to facilitate the arrangements for parliamentary business he invited all members ofthe Cabinet to inform the Secretary as to whetherthey would be attending (l) the Naval Review on tuesday, July 16th, (3) the Fleet Exercises onWednesday, July 17th, or, alternatively, whetherthey would be in London on either or both July16 th and 17th.
DISPUTE between italy AND(etfopia) .(Pr previous reference:Cabinet 34(35), Con-elusion 5.)f.R.2.   With a view to a decision, not the same daybut at an early Meeting, the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs gave the Cabinet a full verbalappreciation of the grave situation that has arisenowing to Italy&apos;s menacing attitude towards Abyssiniaas revealed in the reports of the recent conversations between the Minister for League of Nations affairs and M. Mussolini, which had already been circulatedto the Cabinet.A discussion of a preliminary characterfollowed.It became clear that the action envisaged byM, Mussolini would involve a breach   of -(i) The Agreement of December 13, 1906,respecting Abyssinia, under whichthe United Kingdom, France and Italybind themselves, inter, alia^ &quot;to co-operate in maintaining the politicaland. territorial status quo in Ethiopiaas determined by the state of affairs at pr es ent ex is &quot;t ing ...&quot;:(ii) Article X of the Covenant of theLeague of Nations:&apos;(ill) The Kellogg Pact   important from thepoint&quot;of view of American opinion.An invasion of Abyssinia would, therefore, raisethe issues envisaged by Article XVI of the Covenant,which involved        collective, but not individual,commitments for the signatories.   If those obliga-tions were ignored or evaded, a heavy blow would be struck at the whole of the Pacts and Agreements onwhich the post-war system of Europe had been built up.    It would amount to an admission that the attempt to give the League coercive powers was a mistake  . an admission that would, have serious effects In increasing the existing confusion abroad,as well as on public opinion at home.The responsibility of the Powers on which theburden of fulfilling Article XVI would fall was recognised to be a heavy one, since it involved
not only the present dispute and relations with italy; but also the whole of the existing international system.   If Prance was prepared to honour its obliga-tions, other nations would probably follow.   Without.French co-operation the application of Article XVIwas out of the question, and as yet the attitude ofFrance was uncertain.The Cabinet were informed that a telegram hadalready been sent to Paris to ascertain whetherMi Laval had any .concrete proposals of his own which he intended toput forward at Rome or elsewhere (Telegram Ho.163of July 3, to Paris) ,There was general agreement that the visit ofthe Minister for League of Nations Affairs to Romehad been of advantage in removing all doubts as toM, Mussolini&apos;s attitude.The various courses open to the Cabinet which emerged from this preliminary discussion may besummarised as follows(1) Should we endeavour to detach ourselvesfrom the Abyssinian affair, or were webound to fulfil our obligations underthe Covenant?(S) Should we approach the French Govern-ment in order to ascertain whetherthey were prepared to honour theirobligation under the Covenant?(3) Should we appeal to Article III ofthe Agreement of 1906, which provides,inter alia, that &quot;In no case shall oneof the three Governments interfere inany manner whatsoever except in agree-merit with the other two&quot;, and Article IV,which provides that &quot;In the event ofthe status, quo laid down in Article being disturbed, Prance, Great Britainand Italy shall make every effort to preserve&quot; the integrity of Ethiopia,In any ease, they shall concerttogether,.....&quot; ?If the United Kingdom and France werein agreement, might not the adoptionof this course avert a crisis, and
might it not in any event be preferable to allowing the shockof the dispute to fall direct onthe League of Nations?In connection with, the third of the abovequestions the Cabinet were reminded that the Treatyof 1906 had been concluded when the Powers had atendency towards the partition of Africa, and itwas suggested that the Italians might use this as evidence of the desire they attribute to the UnitedKingdom to keep them from acquiring colonies.The Cabinet were reminded that previousinvestigation of economic sanctions had shown that(since they involved blockade) they were almostbound to lead, to hostilities,Th.er e was genera 1 agr agreement that, while it wasnecessary to continue to keep the Dominions abreastof the development of the situation, it was unnecessary to send any communication to them asto future action pending further discussion by theCabinet.The Cabinet agreed -(a) That, before the question of Abyssiniawas discussed again by the Cabinet, theappropriate Sub-Committee of the Committeeof Imperial Defence&quot; should consider and report on the application ofArticle XVI of the Covenant to Italy,including the possible closing of theSues Canal.   The Sub-Committee shouldbe authorised, if necessary, to consult the Staffs of the Defence departments and/or the Chiefs of Staff Committeedirect:(b) That the Minister for League   of nations affair should be added to the Sub-Committee for the purposes of this Inquiry.A small Sub-Committee of the Advisory Committee of theCommittee of Imperial Defence on Trade Questions inTime of War.

PROPOSEDAIR pact and AIRLIMITATIONAGREEMENT.(previous reference:Cabinet 34(35), Con-elusion 6.)3b ^ -3. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum, bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (0 .P.-135(35)) on the subject of an Air Pact and an AirLimitation Agreement, in which he reported theresults of the recent visit to Paris of the Ministerfor League of Nations affairs, and suggested for cabinet, approval the reply that should be made toM. Laval&apos;a request about the accompaniment of theAir Pact by -bilateral military arrangements and asto negotiations for a General Settlement.Reluctance was expressed by some members of theCabinet to discuss a Paper on so important a subject which it had only been possible to circulate on theprevious evening.    In view, however, of the urgency of some action to break the present deadlock on boththe Air Pact and limitation of air armaments, and ofthe fact that a good deal of the ground had been covered at the Meeting of the Cabinet referred toin the margin, the Cabinet decided to deal with thequestion.In the course of the discussion it was made clear that the intention was not to concludebilateral pacts, but rather to complete the Air Pactby bilateral military arrangements between the powers concerned, so as to facilitate the operation of theAir Pact.The attention of the Cabinet was called to an extract from an earlier Memorandum by theSecretary to the Cabinet and Committee of ImperialDefence   in which he drew attention to the difficulty
of concerting plans with more than one nation to give effect to reciprocal guarantee Treaties(C.I.D. Paper No. 1163-B, Paras. 35 and 36).The Cabinet were informed, however, that whatwas now contemplated/.was not plans, but quitesimple bilateral arrangements containing such/5 ft&apos;cti9cu*it*x o\       1  teohnxcal provisions as might be agreed to becUl&amp;ti* I1U %lutL     l   npoessarv fof rendering the Air Pact effective.Qvdct ftw fa cUiaiUeL j --  - --   -- -----^AAMM.atituul* u&amp;icL   \ The Cabinet were reminded that, as theDominions would be suspicious of any bilateralpact, it would be necessary to explain to them the nature of the bilateral arrangements now contemplated.Attention was called, to the need, in negotia-tions with France, to keep in mind the objectionalready expressed by the German Government tobilateral pacts.&quot;he Cabinet agreed  (a) That the following principles should,form the basis for the conclusion of bilateral military arrangements:-C i) &quot;here should be no bilateralarrangement without an air pact:&quot;(i.i) There should be no bilateralarrangement with one partyonly:(ill) His Majesty&apos;s Government inth e United kingdom om wereprepared to agree to bilateralmilitary arrangements eitheraccompanying or following an air Pact, provided that other parties make no objection.
That, subject to the above, theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs should be authorised toinform the French Government thatfis Ma jestvrs G overnment in theUnited&quot;Kingdom would be preparedto agree to the accompaniment ofthe Air Pact by a bilateral militaryarrangement containing such technicalorovis ions as might be agreed, to benecessary for rendering it effective as between this country and France.This would be on the understandingthat Fis Maiesty&apos;s Government will propose a similar agreement betweenthe United. Kingdom and Germany, and between the United Kingdom and Belgium.In return, the French Government wouldbe asked not to object to the immediateinitiation of discussions between allthe Locarno Powers with a view to the negotiation (as distinct from theconelusion) of an Air Pact and AirLimitation Agreement.  . fhe FrenchGovernment would not be encouraged to believe that we had. in anv wayagreed to the technical provisions which they have suggested as suitablefor inclusion in the bilateral arrange-in ent :That the time and nature of anycoimmnication on the subject toGermany should be left to the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs, who would consult the Prime Minister, and the lord president of the Council if the latterso desired.

The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet thatthere was some hope of the draft reply by theGovernment to Mr Lloyd George being ready forconsideratl.cn by the Cabinet at their next regular weekly Meeting.   The Cabinet must understand,however, that this could not be guaranteed.
THE MEATSITUAT TON.0 ont inuat action of  Cattley.(previous reference e cabinet 33(35), Con-clusion 9.)nfl.3b$S)tO.5- The Cabinet had. before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries (C.P.-133(35)) seeking authority to submit to the Committeeof Home Affairs a Bill to extend the Cattle Industry(Emergency Provisions) Act, 19 35 (which expires atthe end of September, when Parliament will be inrecess) until the end of June, 1936, with power toextend by Order of the Appropriate Ministers, if circumstances so require, for a further and. finalperiod not exceeding three months to the end ofSeptember, 1936, the Order being subject to approval by Resolution of each House of Parliament.   TheChancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of Statefor Scotland, the Secretary of State for HomeAffairs, the Secretary of State for Dominion affairs and the President of the Board of Trade agreed that action along these lines was  desirable, and theMinister of Agriculture and. Fisheries ashedauthority to take the necessary Parliamentary stepsimmediately after the Bill (a draft of which, was attached to the Memorandum) had been considered and approved, by the Committee of Home Affairs, witha view to its passage into law before the Houserises for the Summer Recess .The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries statedthat he would discuss the total liability on theExchequer contemplated under the Bill (0.P.-133 (35),Para,8) with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.&quot;&apos;At the request of the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs he undertook to consider whether the period,could be extended until Wovember 7, 1936, the date when the Argentine Agreement would terminate.At the request of the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs he agreed to keep in mind, In any announce-merits that were being made, the bearing of the
question on the Meat Negotiations with the Dominions.He agreed with the Secretary of State for the colonies in the importance, particularly from the point ofview of public opinion, of measures being taken for improving efficiency in return for an extension ofthe subsidy to farmers, but pointed out the difficultyof working out details until the nature of the long-term agreements was known.The Chancellor of the Exchequer drew attention tothe following extract from C.P.-133 (35), Para .7:-&quot;In introducing the Financial Resolutionit is,  I think, necessary to make itclear that the further payments to bemade are, like those already made fromthe Exchequer, advances which will berecoverable from the Cattle Fund by theExchequer, as circumstances may permit,when the former comes to be fed from the proceeds of the levy&quot;.He observed that this point was not in the Bill.As the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheriesforesaw difficulties in introducing the point intothe Bill, the Chancellor of the Exchequer reservedhis position on that point.The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that,owing to the exigencies of Parliamentary business,the introduction of the Financial Resolution wouldprobably have to be delayed a little.Subject to the above, the Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve in principle the proposals in C.P.-133 (35) as summarised above:(b) That if circumstances should renderthis course necessary, the Ministerof Agriculture and Fisheries shouldbe authorised, to arrange for theFinancial Resolution covering his proposals to be on the Order paper of the House of Commons immediatelyafter the Bill has been considered and .approved, by the .Home Affairs Com-mittee, but without waiting for theCommittee&apos;s Conclusions to be consideredby the Cabinet.

This approval, however, hadbeen given on the understanding that, owing to thestate of the Parliamentary time-table, it might beimpossible to introduce the Bill at any rate beforethe Recess ,   Not only the Government Chief Whip, butalso the Whips of the Labour and the Liberal Parties,were agreed in anticipating that the legislation would be unopposed.In order to save a week of Parliamentary time,the Cabinet agreed -__-(a) That- if the Committee of ^Tome affairs at their Meeting on the following day(Thursday, July &apos;4th) should approve the Bill, the President of the&quot;Boardof Education should have authorityto uroceed. at once with, the steps necessary for the introduction ofthe Bill without waiting for theConclusions of the Committee ofHome Affairs to come before theCabinet:fb) To take note that, under the planproposed by the President of theBoard of Education   the financial resolution on which the Bill hasto be based would, be put down months urs da y afternoon.
