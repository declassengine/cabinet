The Cabinet had before them the following documents relating to the Italo-Abyssinian dispute:.-Extracts from the Most Secret Minutesof a Meeting of the Sub-Committee ofthe Committee of Imperial Defence on defence Policy and Requirements, heldon Novernber 26th (C.P.-220 (35)),circulated to the Cabinet by directionof the Prime Minister:A Note by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs (CP.-SOB (35))circulating (in continuation of cp.-SOO (35)) Proposals adopted bythe Committee of Eighteen at geneva on the 2nd and 6th November inconnection with the application of sanctions to Italy:A Joint Note by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs and the Ministerfor League of Nations Affairs (CP.-212(35)) circulating a Memorandum drawnup in the Foreign Office on the questionof the imposition of an embargo on oil supplies for Italy, and suggesting theattitude to be taken by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the light of the situationdescribed therein:A Note by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs &apos;&apos;CP.-225 (35)) cireu-lating to his colleagues records of conversations the Permanent Under-Secretary of State and himself had had. with General Garibaldi on NovemberS5th and S8th respectively, to whichwas annexed tentative conditions underwhich Italy would be prepared to ceasehostilities and come to Geneva again to lay her case before the League ofNations. . .(The Lord Chancellor, who had an unavoidablepublic engagement, had communicated his views to the Prime Minister and foreign secretary, and some of them were mentioned to the Cabinet by the latter.)The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat the question of an embargo on oil against italy raised a number of very difficult issues.First, the risk of a &quot;mad dog* act by signor mussolini and its consequences.   Second, thefuture of sanctions and, with them, of the League,and, incidentally, the credit of His majesty&apos;s government.As regards the risk of a &quot;mad dog* act therewere two considerations that could not be ignored.
First, he had received a number of alarmist, reports from different Capitals tending to show that signor mussolini would regard an oil -embargo as renderingdefeat inevitable, and might use it as a pretext toget out of his difficulties by attacking the Britishin the Mediterranean, even though it wastantamount to suicide.    Second, there was the questionof the serious gaps in our system of Imperial Defence,which were in a weak state as compared with an Italymobilised for war.   This had been emphasised at theMeeting of the Defence Policy and Requirements Commitstee and in a Report he had read on the priority ofdefensive needs.    That was a subject to which he wishedto return on another occasion, namely, to enquire whether it would not be possible to speed up the replacement of our deficiencies.   Neither of the abovepoints, however, could be ignored.   We ought not to under-rate the risk:   but neither should we ovefrrateit.    In these reports there was much Italian propaganda and it was obviously to Signor Mussolini&apos;s interest tomake the danger appear as terrible as possible.Particular cases had been brought to his noticewhich were clearly Italian propaganda.    In addition^some account ought to be taken of what Signor mussolini had himself said on the subject, to the effect that hewould meet economic sanctions with economic measures and not regard, them as a casus belli..    Only a day or two ago the Press had been told in Rome that an oil embargo would be regarded as an unfriendly actbut not a casus belli.   He had also just received information that members of Lloyds had undertakenlarge insurances on behalf of Italian Companiescovering a considerable period.   It was unlikely that,these Companies would have risked the loss of their money which would occur if war resulted.   To this must be added that at the moment there was a regular
barrage of moves for peace on behalf of Italy, * bySignor Cerruti in Paris, Signor Suvieh in Rome,and General Garibaldi in London (who had now beendisowned by Signor Grandi, though there was no doubtthat he came from Signor Mussolini), and, last of all,by Signor Grandi himself, who, after a long period ofgloomy vaticination, had now become an enthusiast for peace negotiations.-medHe sim/up this part of his remarks by saying thatoil increased the risk of a &quot;mad dog&quot; act, but therewas no reason to get in a panic about it, particularlyin view of some considerations to which he would return later.   Nevertheless, it was very necessaryto take precautions.That raised his second point, namely, the effectof present events on our attitude towards sanctions and collective security.   Whatever some members ofthe Cabinet might have thought in the past,on thesubject of sanctions * there was no doubt that theeconomic effect of sanctions on Italy had already beengreat.   The psychological effect had probably been even greatera   The various countries concerned had provided a more solid front, than we had reasonto expect, subject, of course, to one or two known// As to oil,exceptions, /the oil sanction had been agreed to inprinciple unanimously by the Committee of Eighteenon November 15th, subject to further enquiries aboutthe United States attitude.   He recalled that theCabinet had agreed to it on October 9th in these words&quot;(v) That if oil-producing or supplyingMember States such as Roumania wereprepared to impose an embargo on exports of oil. Bis Majesty sGovernment would be prepared tojoin in this and to consider furtheran embargo on exports of coal&quot;.T*e proposed to ignore coal for the moment.   since then the Member States producers, o-f oil had expressed   I
their readiness to co-operate.   Russia and roumania had written in this sense to the League, and the Dutchhad informed our Minister at The Hague that they wereprepared to co-operate .    In reply to a question theSecretary of State said that the Russian reply was dependent upon the co-operation of other producing countries.   The French, though they were not producers,had expressed readiness to co-operate.   The attitudeof the United States of America had been defined, in mr Cordell Hull&apos;s speech of November 15th, where hehad said -&quot;This class of trade is directly contraryto the policy of this Government as announced in the official statements of the President and the Secretary ofState, as it is also contrary to thegeneral spirit o^&quot; the Neutrality Act.&quot;Since then much public pressure had been brought to hear upon the Oil Companies, who were unpopular inandAmerica^probably President Roosevelt had gained somepopularity in pressing them.    It might be said,therefore, that all the Member States of the Leagueexcept ourselves had expressed their willingness tosupport the oil sanction, and of the non-Member states the only one that counted was bringing pressure to bearon the firms .   Until we gave our answer we were in a difficult position.   Iran was the third supplier of oil to Italy, and in the case of motor-spirit, second.His Majesty&apos;s Government had the largest holding in theAnglo-Iranian Oil Company.   A very active propagandahad started;against us in the United States and france for our failure to define our position, and we werebring reproached that we led in sanctions until themoment when our own interests were affected.The Secretary of State then made his own recoromenda-tions to the Cabinet, which were as follows(l) On no account should we adopt a negative attitude to what we had already accepted on October 9th and
November 29th, or give any appearance of refusingour part in genuine collective action, provided that action was not going to be futile.   Having taken theline that we have, and having fought the Election on it, incidenta.lly, any other course of action would,in his view, be disastrous and indefensible.   Oil was obviously an effective sanction.   The more effectiveit was the more should we be placed in an indefensibleposition if, having supported what, many people thoughtwere ineffective sanctions, we now opposed an effec-tive one.   The Lord Chancellor had taken that view.Rather to his surprise, he had learned that theGovernor of the Bank of England was favourable totheystrong sanctions,on the ground that /   would bring thematter to a head rapidly and that a long-drawn-outapplication of sanctions would bring about a serious situation.   He had received a message from Sir austen chamberlain, who had had a talk with M. Herriot.The latter had been very definite to the effect thatwe ought to go ahead with the oil sanction and thatthe firmer the British Government was the strongerwould be the support we should get from French publicopinion.   His viev was that M* Laval and Parisopinion against sanctions was not representative ofFrance.(2) We must, however, take every possibleprecaution, as follows:-(a) (military). As the Defence Policy and requirements Committee had said, we must at onceclear up the position with Prance.   He had taken action in this matter, with some doubts in hie mind as to the result.   The question had been put byHis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Paris very, explicitly,as to whether we could count on France to assist us if attacked, and whether, in that event, she would regard herself as in a state of war with Italy.
M. Laval&apos;s answer had been a categorical affirmative.Better still, he had repeated this very straightto the Italian Ambassador in Paris.   No assurance could be clearer than the one we had received.   some people, however, might think that M, Laval&apos;s assurance was insufficient as French public opinion would notface the possibility of a war with Italy.   Hesuggested, however, that so long as we were on friendly and intimate terms with France we were bound to accept their assurances.   The Lord Chancellor, he noticed,supported this opinion.At the same time we must check the efficacy of theFrench undertaking by adopting M. Laval&apos;s ownsuggestion to extend the discussions which had begunbetween Naval. Experts to the Army and Air Staffs.The time would also come when we ought toascertain definitely the position of other naval powers.   Discussions with the King of Greece had revealed that there were not likely to be many difficulties in the use of a Greek port.   The question had already been tentatively raised with representa-tives of Yugoslavia and Turkey, but these ought to befollowed up in order to ascertain definitely what theywere prepared to do.    In addition, we must do every-thing possible to expedite our own programme of re-equipment.(b) We must also test the position with theUnited States of America.   We already had the strongmoral support, of the United. States Government *Nevertheless, oil exports to Italy from America inthe Quarter ending September were 96-000 tons asagainst 34,000 tons in the previous year, andprobably more had been purchased.   If an oil embargowere adopted the position would have to be watched,and if American exports to Italy continued high-7-
the position might have to he re-considered.    Incidental^he understood that approaches had been made to the oiltrade in England to see if some pressure could bebrought to bear on the American Companies to agree toavoid an excess of exports, and perhaps the Chancellorof the Exchequer could inform the Cabinet as to theresult.(c) We must press on with the pea.ce negotiations as rapidly as possible, with a view to bringing the conflict to an end.   Mr Peterson, of the ForeignOffice, was now inParis engaged on conversations .Not much progress had been made as yet.   He himself,however, had to go away for reasons of health for ashort time, and he proposed on his journey to seeM. Laval and to try and press on peace talks with him.In addition, Signor Grand! was about to return to Rome,and he proposed that before he left he should, be given some idea of our attitude on the subject.   Later inthe discussion the Secretary of State explained thatthe Italians were anxious to know our views directly,even if they were not acceptable, instead of gettingthem second-hand through Paris.   But we must avoid giving any impression of weakening in support of sanctions.   He was in some doubt, as to whether sane-tions ought to be brought in at once when the LeagueCommittee me* , or whether, to give a better chance tothe peace conversations, the fixing of the date should be adjourned for decision at a later meeting.The issue was whether it might not be better to keepthe prospect of an oil sanction hanging over signor mussolini&apos;s head rather than to fix the date at once,in which case, as Signor Mussolini^ own agentsrepresented, he would become much more intransigeant.On the whole, he thought the issue&apos;depended on theprospect of the peace talks.   If the discussions were going well -- and later in the Meeting he- &amp;-
expressed the view that at first this was likely tobe the ease   the League Committee might meet and he told that the peace talks were going on satisfactorilyand that for that reason we and the French were not asking for the immediate imposition of an embargo.On the whole, he thought that if the talks were goingwell it would he wise to proceed with the embargo by two stages .   There was a great deal to be said fobthis breathing-space, provided that it did not(1) embitter the United States of America and increasethe difficulties of the American Secretary of state in controlling exports;    or (2) break down the sanctions front.   As regards (1) he mentioned a tele-gram he had sent on the previous Saturday to HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington, which had been circulated to the Cabinet.   The Ambassador had not yetseen the American Secretary of State.   If the Americanreactions were bad, it might be necessary to re-consider the suggestion of the two stages, as it was essential to have no misunderstanding with America inthis matter.Summing up his suggestions, the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs proposed:-(l) To go ahead with the oil sanctionon the lines he had proposed:(2) To take the precautions he had suggested:(3) To go ahead with the peace talks:   and(4) Provided the prospects were satisfactory,to leave the date of application of sanctions.In reply to various questions the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs amplified his statement insome details.   All he proposed to give to SignorGrandi was a fra.me%vork of our own ideas on thesubject.   A,s regards the oil sanction, M. Laval hadalready agreed +0 it in principle.   Most nations had-9-
agreed, except ourselves.   Consequently, the procedureat Geneva on the subject was likely to be rather brief.Signor Mussolini was expecting the date of the oil sanction to be fixed at Geneva next week.    If therewere a postponement this would be such a relief tohim that he was unlikely to take precipitate actionin consequence of a mere confirmation of a principlealready accepted .The statement of the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs was followed by a general discussion, in thecourse of which the Prime Minister invited the opinionof every member of the Cabinet.   &quot;Taere was generalagreement on the Secretary of state&apos;s proposal, ifpossible, to divide the application of the oil sanctioninto two stages, the principle being confirmed at thefirst, and the date left to be settled at the second stage.if in the meantime no settlement had been reached.The First Lord of the Admiralty and the Secretaryof State for Air gave the Cabinet highly secret,particulars of the state of preparedness of the fleet and the Royal Air Force in the Mediterranean area.(Particulars are on record in the Cabinet office in connection with CP.-220 (35)) .    The gist ofthese statements was that, although there was nodoubt that the Fleet was strong enough to obtaincommand of the Mediterranean, we might sustain serious losses, since our forces were not in a proper stateof readiness for war in a land-locked sea.   economic sanctions had been built up behind the strength of ourMediterranean Fleet, and if our weaknesses were knownsome of the nations supporting sanctions might showless alacrity.   The reaction   of possible hostilities in the Mediterranean on our Imperial Defence positionin other parts of the world was emphasised.   the defences of Singapore were still incomplete, and ourposition in the Par East depended on the British Navy.
So long as the Fleet was tied upon the Mediterraneanthe position would he difficult.The air position in the Mediterranean was even worse than that of the Fleet, as, although when all theforces in the Near Fast, including the Fleet Air Arm,were added together we had numerical parity, theItalian machines had a better performance, particularly as regards long-range bombers and perhaps fighters.   .Our personnel, however, was superior.   Although our air forces would act in some respects on interiorlines, we were liable to attach from, different quartersat the same time, so that it was difficult to interceptbombing attacks-   Under present plans no anti-aircraft-guns would be available for the defence of Alexandria.The Air Force could therefore only do the best itcould to act in support of the Fleet and to attack thehypothetical enemy in Libya.     In the matter of theoutput of machines and ammunition it was impossibleto increase the rate of production.   The only thing that could deflect an Italian air attack would be toattack the Italian bases and North Italy.   Thatdepended on complete co-operation by France.   vVeshould require not only facilities for our own aircraftbut active co-operation by the French Air Force inattack and defence against counter-attack.   some assistance in the matter of supply would, be required from the Army.It was pointed out that if we suffered losses,whether in the Fleet or the Royal Air Force, we shouldlower the datum point from which the expansion of our forces (as dealt with in the Report of the defence requirements Committee) would start.   From the Navaland Air point of view, therefore, it was represented that our defence forces and defences in theMediterranean were not in a proper condition for war,and from this point of view it was urged that an effort
should be made to obtain peace, holding the threat ofthe oil sanction over Italy, and that the fixing ofthe date should, not be decided, until after a failureof peace discussions.It was also strongly urged, from the point.of viewof the Defence Services, that no decision to applysanctions should be taken until effective co-operation by Prance had been secured, in accordance with previous cabinet decisions.The Secretary of State for War thought that it waseasy to exaggerate the importance of the shortage of anti-aircraft ammunition, as the effectiveness of anti-aircraft guns was doubtful, and there wereoccasions when clouds, and. so forth, rendered the of little value.   He was fairly satisfied, as to the rapid increase that was being made in the productionof anti-aircraft ammunition.   As regards the date,postponement for a fev- weeks or a month, was not goingto make much difference in our state of preparedness.He also made some comments on the policy to be adopted,which are included in the general summary which follows .One suggestion made in the course of the discussion was that if the result of oil sanctions was to producewar it would break the League of Nations, since no-one would support a League which not only failed to stop the war but actually extended it.A suggestion was made that Instead of taking adecision at Geneva on December 12th in favour of an embargo in principle and. publishing it withoutnaming the date, which would put Signor Mussolini ina difficult position of being aa.ke* to climb down underduress, it might be better to prolong the discussion at Geneva pending the ascertainment of what action was going, to be taken elsewhere, and meanwhile, inconjunction with France, to warn Signc-r Mussolini
that the oil sanction could not he held off much longer.It was explained, however, that almost all the governments had already committed themselves in principle to the oilsanctions, as had most other nations except ourselves,and that the only thing to he done was to settle the date.It was pointed out that the political situation had gone far beyond our own military situation, andthat if Signor Mussolini were to take action it wouldnot be a mere &quot;mad dog&quot; act but based on some real plan.If he were forced to make a complete surrender he virouldprobably disappear from Italian politics and there mightbe a Communist Government in Italy and a completealteration in the whole European situation.      In thecircumstances mentioned by the Defence Ministers we ought not to face hostilities unless they were abso-lutely forced upon us.      We ought to do everything possible to shov/ our disinterestedness in the wholeof this question   though many people did not believe it   and point out that for us sanctions had one sa4&amp;object, tnat we were/concerned so much with there-distribution of Abyssinian territory as to remove from Europe the danger of aggression.      The First Actin this drama showed Signor Mussolini as the principalfigure on the stage.      At the end of the First Act hewould disappear^    but the Second Act might show herr hitler on the stage, and we could not dissociate ourpresent difficulties in the First Act from the Second Act,If the malignant influences in the present positionremained intact we should have to face up to them later in another episode.      It was urged, therefore, that weshould make clear that it was not the dispute between italy and Abyssinia that specially interested us, but rather the dispute between the League and an aggressor.Another point made was that the position would be worse in the future if, having attempted sanctions,sanctions failed. ,-13-
As regards the United States, it was pointed&quot; outthat we need not pay too much attention to their position as they were actually increasing heavilytheir export o^ oil to Italy.   Moreover, it waspossible to purchase their co-operation at too higha price,   ^hey must realise that we had to consider our own security, their own position being unaffectedin this respect .A point strongly urged was that if sanctionswere adopted at all they should he brought to themaximum efficiency in order to bring the crisis toan end as soon as possible.     The longer sanctionscontinued, the greater the danger of a break inthe common front.      It had to be borne in mindalso that oil sanctions hit the armies , whereas the imports sanction hit the civilian population.It was urged that press information as to Italianexamplespurchases of oil in Suez, for example, and other/would be brought up at Geneva and make ourposition very difficult if we did not agree to theapplication of the oil sanction.Some members of the Cabinet thought the riskof an Italian aggression to be remote.      Italy had given hostages to fortune.      In the event of warher armies in Abyssinia and Libya would be in a precarious position with their communications cut.On the other hand, the Cabinet were given secret information which indicated that the Italian threats of an active retaliation to an oil embargo had been implemented by actual preparations.The Minister for League of Nations Affairsurged strongly that if he was asked to do all hecould to obtain a postponement in the date of
sanctions he must he instructed on no account tobreak the common front.      He had received information from Geneva that when the Committee of Eighteenmet December 21st was likely to be proposed forthe imposition of the oil sanction.      If there weregooda/prospect of a result from the peace talks,it   might   be   possible     to       obtain      a postpone-ment of the date, but if the prospects were not goodhe asked that he might not be given instructionsto work for two stages.It was suggested that it would not be wise to adopt the oil embargo as a threat unless we wereprepared to implement itQProm the point of view of British trade, theCabinet were asked to realise that sanctions wereinvolving very serious loss, and representations were constantly being made to the Board of trade by the various trade organisations to this effect.That justified,not the wriping out of sanctions,but great caution where British trade was concerned.The Cabinet were reminded that Sanctions I,  II and had been agreed to because they would put pressure on Italy with, the least possible cost totrade.      The proposed Sanction IV was leading usfurther down the path.      It was impossible to turnback but the proposed oil embargo made the positionvery serious.     as regards the United States ofAmerica, their oil importation into Italy during thelast six months had been prodigious and was increasing every week.      This importation was notcarried out only by the Standard Oil Companybut also by the independent companies.     Although
the oil trade was unpopular in America these companies were politically powerful.    Consequently a great dealof oil was likely to continue to go into Italy.    if that happened it would not in fact be possible, as hadbeen suggested, for the League to retrace its steps,because no-one would like to say that America&apos;sfailure to control the situation exonerated other nations from furnishing oil to Italy.    Prom a trade-point of view a long-drawn-out period of sanctionswas the worst condition of all.   A reverse in theMediterranean would cost us less than twelve monthsof sanctions .    The real question for decision was whether we were proceeding in the right way.   signor mussolini as yet had shown no signs of weakness.Possibly he was thinking more of Egypt than of abyssinia&quot;,    more of Alexandria than of Malta.    the gap between our foreign policy and the state of our defence forces and defence was too. wide .   The cabinet ought to give the greatest consideration to the graveobservations of the First Ford of the Admiralty andthe Secretary of State for Air and their warning of thepossibility of serious losses, for if we proceeded withthe oil sanction and it brought about a serious reverse,the public would not easily forgive the Government,especially when the serious warnings of the defence departments became known.Towards the end of the Meeting it was pointed outthat there was practically no difference of opinion on what should be done, but only on emphasis.    there appeared to be general agreement that we should, notdecline to take part in an oil embargo, provided that other countries were prepared to go on with it.   Asto the method, the question at issue was whether weshould urge the application of sanctions at once
or after an interval in which to try and promote a peaceful settlement.      The United States held the hey to the position.      Their output of oil was so large that they could render the withholding of produce of other countries of no avail.If at the present time the United States action wasnot supported,  the President&apos;s strong policy-would hestultified and he would refuse to give furtherco-operation.      In this situation it had been thoughtwise to consult the Chairman of the Anglo-iranian oil Company who had promised to get in touch withthe Chairman of the Standard Oil Company.      Sir JohnCadman had reported that it was not possible toobtain an informal bar on the supply of oil to Italy,in other words, a voluntary arrangement, unlessthe League applied an embargo.      He was satisfied,however, that the companies would be willing not toincrease their supplies to Italy.      He thought alsothat public opinion in America would enable thePresident to check the export of oil.      Finally, sir john had expressed the view that an embargo on oilwould be an effective sanction.The object of an oil sanction was to stop war.If the war could be stopped by making the peacethat would be better.      That ought to be tried,therefore, if there were a reasonable prospect ofsuccess.      The question at issue was whether an oil sanction would contribute towards a peaceful solution or make Signor Mussolini more intransigeant.Prom this point of view the right course api^eared tobe that proposed by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, namely, that if        peace talksshowed a reasonable prospect of success, the oil
sanction should be postponed and the true reasongiven.      If Signer Mussolini was intransigeantthe League ought to face up to the risks.      AfterM. Laval&apos;S definite statement Italy would findherself opposed by all the other countries and an aggression on her part would mean suicide.      signor mussolini was so all-powerful that he could make his people believe that a peaceful settlement was a successful issue.      On the other hand, inother countries it would be said that but for the oil sanction he would have obtained a good deal more and, consequently, sanctions would remain a deterrent in the future.      The suggestion was supported, therefore, that if peace discussions heldout reasonable prospects of success, the oil sanction should be postponed, but that if they openedup no prospects of success, the sanction must be imposed in spite of the risks.      In the meanwhile,it was urged that the interval before the meetingof the League should be employed to push on as rapidly as possible with peace talks.The Cabinet were reminded of the remarkableunanimity between the Dominions and the mother country on the question of sanctions, and it was urged that in order to maintain this common frontthere should be an early meeting with representativesCabinet&apos;sof the Dominions in London as soon as the/decisionhad been taken.      The Cabinet were informedthat  fee High Commissioners had already been soundedinformally as to the line proposed by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs and that it was likely to meet with their approval at the proposed meeting.      The proposed meeting was generally agreed to.
a suggestion was made that the position of theUnited States of America should, be cleared up, inorder to avoid the mlsunderstanding in which efforts to work with Washington so often resulted.   The mostdisquieting features in American policy were, firstly,,their attempt always to keep a step ahead of theLeague of Nations.   They might have another brightidea next week, and we ought to give a hint that atthe moment we did not want additions to sanctions.Secondly, the President was acting while Congress was out of session, which enabled him to take the highmoral line with success .   But if Congress were torefuse to support the President his position would be undermined.   A paradoxical point was that, under the neutrality Law, if Congress were to add exports towhat the President was entitle-&quot;&apos;&apos; to withhold and sign or Mussolini perpetrated, an aggression, we shouldalso have American supplies withheld from us.    It wassuggested that these doubts ought to he put franklyto the United. States, hut the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs thought this would be premature.If there were a great fall in the amount of exports in the next month we should have got what we wanted,and it was desirable to avoid any issue between congress and the President.Another suggestion was that, pending the fixing the date at Geneva, we should, try and secure generalagreement that no nation would increase its normalexports to Italy,    &quot;&quot;his would facilitate the policyof postponing the date of the embargo.   &quot;Iris wasagreed to, as was a further suggestion that thePresident of the Board of Trade, in consultation withthe Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should atonce see representative ives of the Anglo-Iranian andShell Oil Companies (which controlled all British-19-
oil concerns as subsidiaries) with a view to securingaction by this country on these lines.After emphasis had been laid on the importance ofa success to the League of Nations, especially as a warning to Germany, the discussion reverted to thepossible effect of sanctions on Signor Mussolini.It was suggested that if the peace talks failed andsanctions were applied, Signor Mussolini would seethat he was bound to be beaten.    In that event he might decide that he would not yield to the League ofNations and attack this country in order to avoid thatnecessity-    In this connection the question was raised as to whether we had really, made satisfactory and binding arrangements with Prance.   Until such arrange-?ments had been made it was urged once more that we ought not to fix the date of the oil sanctions-    Ifthe negotiations showed that &quot;ranee was not willing toco-operate, the whole matter would have to be re-considered -The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreedto this.So far as the French Navy was concerned, however,the Cabinet were informed, that we could hardly avoidaccepting the unsatisfactory situation vis-a-vis France.Although the French port defences could not be mannedwithout, mobilisation, we could hardly ask Prance to mobilise when we had not. done so ourselves .    It was generally accepted, however, that we ought to go aheadat once with the military conversations and. clear thewhole matter up.The Secretary of State for War said that the GeneralStaff were somewhat doubtful as to the necessity ofmilitary conversations.   The Cabinet were informed,however, that they v.-ere important from an Air pointof view.
The suggestion was made that a week was a very short time to establish whether the peace conversa-tions were going well or not and to clear up themilitary position.    It was hoped that the foreign secretary would take a generous view of the italian attitude .The Secretary of State for foreign Affairs agreedthat the peace talks must be given the best possiblechance.A suggestion was made that, in the event of thepeace conversations holding out reasonable prospects of success, the French Delegate at Geneva should beasked to take the initiative in proposing an adjourn-ment of the decision on the oil sanction.Some discussion took place as to the best procedure for the further military conversations with France.The Secretary of State for &quot;oreign Affairs thought itwould be best for him to open up the subject withM. Laval when he saw him on Saturday, December fth..but the question was left open.It was suggested, however,. that this hardly allowedsufficient, time before the meeting of the Committeeof Eighteen at Geneva on December 12th, before which time the Cabinet wished to be clear on the subject.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointedout, however, that the main difficulty was that theFrench Government was so pre-occupied with their internal political troubles that it. would, be difficultto begin conversations in any event before December5th.    On the whole, therefore, the Secretary ofState&apos;s suggestion was adopted, on the understandingthat he would press the matter forward, as rapidly aspossible.The Prime Minister said, that on broad lines therewas general agreement, as proved by the discussion..If by any chance hostilities should arise out of these
events the situation, for the Government would be ahad one unless everything possible had been done toavoid them, especially when the detailed facts ofour defensive preparations became known.    If thatoccurred in dealing with Signor Mussolini, no-one would be willing to tackle Herr Hitler.    Consequentlyif, at the next meeting of the Committee of Eighteen,the date could be postponed and time could be gainedfor pe-sce talks with a view to working arrangements and for enquiries as to whether the oil sanction could be made effective, it would be all tothe good.    If the claim that had been made thats anctions meant war proved by experience to be true,it would be a disaster of the first magnitude.   It hadto be remembered that in dealing with Signor Mussoliniwe were not dealing with a normal kind of intellect.He thought, however, that the Cabinet was right in supporting the Foreign Secretary&apos;s proposals, but he hoped that the Cabinet would have an opportunity tore-examine the position in the light of the latest developments if the peace talks did not hold out a prospect of success.    It had to be remembered thatit was this country that would have to withstandthe first shock of an Italian forcible reaction toto sanctions.   He himself was not willing to be committed at this moment to the 21st December as thedate of the application of oil sanctions.
The Cabinet agreed  (a) That in principle the continuanceof the policy adopted on October 9th(Cabinet 45 (35), Conclusion 6 (v))should he approved, namely, to join in an embargo on exports of oilprovided that other oil-producingor supplying Member States wereprepared to do so, but that everyprecaution must be taken to safeguard our security:(b) That in applying this policy we should aim at securing a decision as to thedate in two stages, with a view&apos; to giving time for the negotiation dfa peaceful settlement, if possible:(c) That in the meanwhile the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs shouldinitiate the following action:-(i) Pressing on by every usefulmeans with discussions withthe count ries conc concerned, witha view, if possible, to a peaceful settlement:(ii) An early continuation of themilitary conversations whichhad already begun between theAdmiralty and the French Ministryof Marine, and which should nowbe extended, to the Air Force and,if necessary, to the Army, on thelines which the French government themselves had suggested, for ensuring full co-operationbetween the Naval, Militaryand Air authorities of thetwo countries:(iii) Similar conversations with otherMediterranean Powers at theappropriate time and place:(iv) Further to test the attitude ofthe United States of America andthe probability of effective action being taken in that countryto stop the supply of oil toItaly :(d) That if the conversations with a viewto a settlement were found before december 12th to afford reasonableprospects of success, the Committeeof Eighteen at Geneva, at its meetingon December 12th, should be asked,preferably by the French as well asthe British Delegate, to postponeficing the date until a. further meeting (a preference was expressedfor French initiative):
(e) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should bring the question back for consideration by the Cabinet in either of the following circumstances(i)  If the peace talks did not offer any reasonable prospectof a se111 ernent:(ii)  If the military conversationsshowed that France was not willing to co-operate effectively:(f) &quot;hat, pending the decision on the dateof the application of the oil sanction,the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should take such steps as hethought fit to secure that the nationsexporting oil should limit their exportsto Italy to their normal figures:(g) That the President of the Board of trade should ask the Anglo-Iranian and ShellOil Companies whether they were willingto co-operate in applying Conclusion(f) above, and inform the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs of theresult of his enquiries:(h) That the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs should arrange for an early meeting of the representatives of the-Dominions in London with a view to securing their agreement in the abovepolicy.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,December 2 , 193 5 .
