The Cabinet had before them the Report ofthe Cabinet Committee on the Speaker&apos;s Seat fC,P,-14S(35)), which had been appointed at the meeting mentioned in the margin&apos;.   The o oh elusions andrecommendations  or the Committee were summarised at the end of their Report as follows:-(i) it is of great importance to maintainthe present position of the Speakership,by which the Speaker stands aloof fromParty c ontroveray:(ii) There are serious objections, bothon practical and on constitutlonalgrounds    which preclude us fromrecommending that legislation shouldbe passed in order to ensure that the speaker should not be opposed atFlections:    this could only be doneby legislating that the Speaker atthe end of one Parliament should in virtue of that fact be treated as amember at the beginning of the next:(ill) We recommend that an authoritatives tat ement of the consf i11111 ona 1 position regarding the Speakership should be maeUeby the Prime Minister in the &quot;oxise ofC ommons :(iv) Every encouragement should then begiven to prominent Parliamentaryspokesmen, of any or all Parties, to conduct inside Mr. Speaker&apos;s constituencya campaign which will secure his return.The Lord President of the Council, as Chairmanof the Cabinet Committee,  informed his colleagues that the Leader of the Labour Opposition had notifiedthat his Party intended to contest the Speaker&apos; sSeat and were not willing to treat it as sacrosanct.In the course of the discussion a number of suggestions were made: e.g., that steps should betaken before the Recess to obtain public expression of the agreement already given privately by Mr LloydGeorge and sir -Herbert Samuel in the principles ofthe Cabinet Committee&apos;s Report:    that someone shouldbe deputed to organise the arrangements for securingactive co-operation in the &apos;Speakerfs Constituency by those Leaders who agreed in the principles of the
Cabinet Committee&apos;s Report:    that whoever undertookthis task of organisation should ensure thatpoliticians speaking in the constituency should address themselves not to questions of ordinarypolitical controversy, but to the desirability of keeping the Speaker&apos;s Seat Inviolable, and to an explanation of the impossible position in which anySpeaker of the House of Commons would find himselfafter a hotly contested Election:    that the british broadcasting Corporation should be asked to make a rather full statement on the day on which the PrimeMinister announced, the Government&apos;s decision inParliament.The Cabinet agreed  (a) ^o approve the Report of the CabinetCommittee on the Speaker&apos;s seat(CP.-142 (35)), the Conclusions ofwhich are summarised, above:(b) That the arrangements for giving effect to the recommendations inthe Report, both within the Speaker&apos;sconstituency and elsewhere, should beleft to the Prime Minister   the lord president of the Council and the HomeSeeretary ,

The Report stated that theChancellor of the Exchequer had reserved his rightto intervene again on the questions of theprovision of finance for the scheme and the dateof its provision, in view of the necessity for himto weigh the claims of education against the competing claims of other subjects involving theprovision of finance, desired to be included inthe General Election programme.After considerable discussion the cabinet agreed - (a) To approve the first part of thep o1i cy prop os ed, whi eh invoIv eslegislation, viz *:-(i) Raising the school-leaving age to 15 with exemptions for bene-ficial employment and. withoutmaintenance allowances&apos;.(ii) Empowering Local EducationAuthorities to make (withinspecified limits of time)building grants to voluntary schools for purposes- of re-&quot;organisation and raising theage, such grants to be notmore than 75 per cent. norless than 50 per cent. of thetotal cost, the Pxchequer topay 50 per cent, on the annualloan charges for the Authority&apos;expenditure,subject to reservation for the present of a decision as to the dates at which effect was to be given to the above recommendations:
(b) That the above Conclusion (a) shouldalso be subject to the principle thatthe legislation (which from certain points of view..will be unpopular insome quarters) must be balanced byan education policy on the lines ofthe administrative proposals in theReport, viz.:-(i) Encouragement of provision ofNurs ery Schools es peela1ly in poor -areas :(ii) Promotion, of development of physical Training in all types of school:(ill) General development of theSchool Medical Service:(iv) Removal of the upper limit of&quot;special places&quot; in secondary schools :(v) Increase in the number of StateScholarships tenable at Universities,throwing them, open to pupils inall Secondary Schools   a. question on which J-.he_Cha.noellpr of theExchequer reserved, his agreement for,, the present:(vi) Increase in the amount of state assistance to State Scholars andholders of other comparable awards;(vii) Institution of a syet an of Scholar-ships tenable at Training Collegesfor Dominion and Colonial Scholars - on which the Secretary of State for(viii) Development of the provision of technical education:(ix) Development of adult education.(e) That the President of the Board ofEducation should continue to work, outthe administrative details summarised above, in consultation with the Government.

VISCOUNT GREYOF FAL10DON -PROPOSEDMEMORIAL TO.6. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the First Commissioner of Works (C.P.-134 (35))on the question of a proposed Memorial to the lateLord Grey of Pallodon.   Various suggestions hadbeen put forward by a Committee of Lord.GreyTsfriends, upon which the First Commissioner had invited the observations of the Royal Pine art commission,    He hoped, that the Cabinet would authorise him to inform the Committee that the most appropriate memorial to Lord Grey would be in theform of a bust to be placed in the vacant niche atthe head of the first flight of stairs on the mainstaircase in the Foreign Office.The Cabinet agreed with the First commissioner of Works in rejecting the proposals that had. beenmade for a statue to Lord Grey of Fallodon on anysite adjoining the wall of the gardens atNos. 10 and 11 Downing Street.    Believing thatafter the expiration of a fe- years it was almost certain that room would be found for a statue toLord Grey within the precincts of the House ofCommons, they agreed  That for the moment the most appropriate memorial would bein the form of a bust to beplaced in the Foreign Office,
^ jgATES7w The Cabinet had before them a Mem.orana.-am bythe Minister of transport fCP.-139 (35)) on thesubject of the Rail-way Freights Rebates Scheme, inmight flow from, certain recent decisions reducingthe valuation of the Southern and London and NorthPastern Railways.   The effect of these decisions, ifupheld and. applied. In the case of other railways,would be the insolvency of the Rebates Fund, the suspension for a number of years of the Freight-Rebates Scheme, a serious outcry by the tradersaffected, and possibly a demand that the Governmentshould, intervene.   He proposed to - sound the RailwayCompanies as to their readiness to co-operate inpossible measures to keep the Rebates Scheme alivein certain eventualities, and pointed out that itmight be necessary in the autumn to ask permission to introduce, with a view to its passage as an urgentmeasure, a short Bill to effect certain amendments in the Eleventh Schedule to the Local Government Act,19 9,   Attached to the Memorandum was a Note by theBoard of Trade pointing out that a suspension   orsubstantial reduction of the rebates would have aserious effect on the coal trade and other indxjstriesconcerned, and that the inevitable rise in price would result not only in a reduction of our coal exports but would also lead to protests from, theGovernments with which Trade Agreements had. been concluded.As the Minister of Transport was unable to be present, the Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinet that the Memorandum was intended as a warning ,of a disagreeable question that would shortly arise for consideration.mhe Cabinet took note of C.P.-139 (35).
