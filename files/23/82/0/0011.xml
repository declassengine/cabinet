The Cabinet had before them the following documents :-A Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs on the Frenchrequest, for an assurance regardingthe future Fritish attitude in theevent of a resort to force in Furopeor of an infraction of the Covenantby another Furouean Power (C.P.-177( 35) ) :A draft Fete in reply to the aboveFrench request, circulated, by theSecretary of State for Foreign.Affairs tc .P.-179 (35)).Immediately before the Meeting of the Cabinetthe following telegrams from Mr Fden to the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs were handed round.t-No, 155, of September 23rd, containingan account of a conversation with. Penes :No. 161, of September 23rd, recordingthat, the Committee of Five had unani-mously decide.ed. to report to the Councilon the failure of-&apos;   their attempt toa ch i ev e a s e 111 em en t:No. 164, of September 24th, describinga conversation with M, Laval in whichthe latter had. emphasised, the sincerity of his determination to work step bystep with this country and to carrv out his obligations under the Covenant, andin which he had advocated the working outof economic sanctions for application in stages.    It was added that meetings between the two delegations for thispurpos e w er e b ein.g arranged .As an introduction to the discussion of the French note the Secretary of State ^or Foreign Affairs gave the Cabinet, a brief account of developments in thepolitical field since their last Meeting on August 22nd,and an appreciation of the present position, in thedispute between Italy and Abyssinia.    In the course ofthis he reported that Italy had. not a friend in Furope.Even Austria, whose general attitude was favourable to Italy, was shocked by the present Italian attitude:and Poland, which was not generally favourable tocollective action, was prepared to play its part if
countries like Holland and Sweden were prepared toplay their part.    Spain vas still shaky, hut wouldhave to come in in the event of collective action.He was convinced that the French Government had deliberately elected to work with us if the questionof collective action arose&quot;    that is to say, economic pressure, which did not raise the issue of belligerentrights.    V, Laval had vacillated, at times, but had now come round to our own view, which was confirmed by the telegrams laid on the table, and was prepared to join in economl c/^e-et4*e*5ts-.    As regards non-Member Statesit would be essential,  if the question of economic sanctions arose, to ascertain their intentions.    Itlo tlcdU,seemed, probable that Germany, who-was not ready totake advantage of the situation and in additiondespised the Italians, would adopt a very discreetattitude, and, though not likely to co-operate, would,do nothing to render League action futile.   He had reason to believe that the President and Secretary ofS tat e ot tha Unit ed States of America would/ otiibtohtheir powers to extend the embargo on arms and muni-tions to Italy, but it would, be necessary, beforeaction was taken, to get this clear.   mhe secretary&quot;^ State for Foreign Affairs * strong impression wasthat isolated action by Italy against. British interest was less probable than it had been, as Signer Mussolinwas clearly impressed by the unanimity of opinion inthe Hnited Fingdom and the whole Empire, as well asby the strengthening of the British Fleet in theWed it mediterranean.    At the end of last week the foreign secretary had instructed the British Ambassador in rome to see the Foreign Minister and to tell him theextent of the reinforcements sent, to the Mediterraneanas well as the reason for reinforcement, namely, themenaces in the Italian Press.   This had had a good
res v. 11. and 3. useful c ommunlou e had. ha an Issued in both countries.    At the end of the previous week the French Ambassador had given the&apos;Secretary ofState an account of an interview between the french ambassador and Signer Mussolini and had. reporteduSigner Mussollnivs curious belief that the BritishAdmiralty were determined to destroy the Fascistfleet, that the Fritish Government were equallydetermined to humiliate Italy before the world, andthat       the premature publication by a Britishnewspaper of the gist of the Report of the Committeehad been citedof Five/as an example.   ^he secretary of Stat e had accordingly instructed sir Rric Drummohd to seeSigner Mussolini and. to give him the facts, namely,that we had. nbt the smallest desire to humiliateItaly and would warmly welcome a settlement-    thatthe statement as to the Fleet was totally withoutfoundation&quot;    and that the premature revelation ofthe contents of the Report had been made to a Frenchnewspaper.    Fe had. iu?t received a report fromSir Fric Drummond to the effect that the atmosphereat his conversation with Signer Mussolini had beenvery friendly, that the Duce had thanked him for hismessage and. had stated that he did not want to embroilhimself with us.   I-Ie had admitted, that in our placehe himself would, have sent reinforcements to theNediterranean.    Consequently   from the point of viewof these alarms the situation had improved, but Sir BrieDrummond. had not been able to report any Improvementin the Abyssinian situation.    Signor Mussolini, hadnot moved from his position and saw no daylight inthe Report of the Committee of Five.    It was clear,however, that the Italians were.now somewhat nervous
to realise, and were apprehensive even   of modifiedsanctions.    Of course we naturally were inclined tothink of our own difficulties, hut it seemed probablethat even modest sanctions might be more effective than had hitherto been thought.The advice of the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs to the Cabinet was that we should continueto pursue the policy of fulfilling our treaty obliga-tions, which had been decided on August 82nd, subjectto&apos;the same conditions and precautions, seeking always to follow up any chance of a settlement;    but that,if it came to the point where there was agreement atthe League of Mations in favour of applying economic pressure and we ,vere assured that States which werenot members o^ the League would, not undermine that policy, we should be prepared to play our part.Turning to the question of the French Note, he recalled that V, Laval had given notice of his intention to raise this question in his talks withthe Minister for League of Fattens Affairs at the&quot;by^ee^-PowoT3.......i^ii^anQiUjip^s^-QnS1.    Fnowing that the question was to be raised, the Secretary of State had. addressedpart of his remarks in the Assembly to this issue,and the draft, now before the Cabinet, was really a re-statement, only slightly embroidered, of what: he had then said.    Fe thought it imperative to give an answerand to give it soon:    otherwis e there would becriticisms from two d.irec-5&quot;ions , namely   from the FrenchGovernment on the ground that we were interested, onlyin. Abyssinia., and from Mr Lloyd George that we wereundertaking new commitments to France.     He had discussed the draft reply with one or two of hiscolleagues.   He asked for liberty of action as to thetime when he should give it to France-    but he also asked, for authority, in connection with the answer, to
put to the French Government the quest ion as to whatFrance would do supposing, pert imposglblie.  Italyere to make an attack on our forces or interestsin the Med.iterranean.    Ills idea was to send to theFrench Ambassador to inform him that an answer to his question was - coming and to s ay that in the meant linehe would like to ask a question on. behalf of theUnited Kingdom Government.    Summarising, he asked the Cabinet, first, to approve the action he had.taken&apos;    second,  to approve the Note, subject to asmall alteration so as to make it clear, apropos.the penultimate passage of M. C orb in&apos;s Note   that wereserved liberty of action as to her Article 16 ofthe Covenant should be applied.!!    and, third, approval to an approach to the French Government as to theirattitude in the event of an Italian attack.In reply to various questions, the Secretaryof State expressed the view that collective agreement could only be obtained for sanctions on a ver?/- mil ft-basis    such ss prohibition of export to Italy ofcertain materials and refusal to accept Italiangoods, but that even such mild sanctions wouldprobably shorten the war.    If the League confineditself to a moral condemnation of Italy, its futilitywould be exposed.    If sanctions were imposed he though:,that Italy would %o bouho. be withdraw, at leasttemporarily, from the League.    He thought that if circumstances required it, collective sectcity oughtto be tried out, as if it was not. effective the sooner we knew it the better.In the course of the dis cuss ion several tributeswere paid t o the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs both for his speech at. the League assembly on September 11th and his general handling of the
attrition.    It was suggested that before entering onsanctions we ought to know how far they would be effective.    It war, understood th-1 *he Corrmltt.ee whichhad been studying these questions had reached theconclusion that the minor sanctions suggested by theSecretary of State would only reduce the period duringwhich Italy could conduct war In Abyssinia from 34 toSI months, and that the refusal of Italian exports-would harm ourselves more than Italy.    Any form of sanctions. It was pointed out, were a belligerent   act,and it. was doubtful whether Signor Mussolini wouldcontent himself with a n&quot;ere protest, in &quot;reply.   &quot;hetroubles that would ari?e between Italy and ours elvesmight not be shared by any other country in Europe,and the attitude of the United States was doubtful.Consequently the full, economic cons ecuences might fallon this country.    There was no sign that any country,action in support ofin spite of bold, speeches at Geneva, was taking/ourview.    :,-re did not even know i whether our Navy could use the French ports, which was essential.   Roumaniawas reported to be doing very good, business with Italyand had. discovered that, the large consignments of oilordered by Germany were intended for Italy;    so thatM. Titulescu favoured military rather than economic sanctions.    In Belgium the Press was unfriendly, and.in Scandinavia als.o it was far from friendlyr   whilethe Spaniards hoped to reap the advantages of a neutral.There was general agreement that, we ought not toenter upon economic sanctions without being clear onall the above points.   *ffe should have to begin discussionOf sanctions by unmistakable assurances that an attackon one meant an attack on all.One suggestion v.&apos;as that we should, try and induceFrance to take the lead occasionally in the discussions at Geneva.    It was also repeatedly emphasised that, we
must be clear as to the French attitude.   mhe strongesaassurance we could have for our own security was that signor Mussolini should know that if, he attacked thiscountry France would retaliate against him and allowvs to use French ports.the serious consequences of receding from our previous attitude were emphasised from the point ofvie1&quot; of domestic policy no less than from that, of)foreign policy.    It was pointed out that any weaknessv or vacillation would bring serious consequences.   the dangers on the other side had to he examined, but itcould now he said that our Fleet in the Mediterraneanwas strong enough to safeguard us against a. disaster,though the question of the ports was admittedlytins a t. is fa c t cry unt il th e Fr ench&apos; pos it 1 on was cl ear edup.   No decision was being asked for that day as tosanctions, and the^a appeared, still to he airole timeto consider the matter,    Hnless the burden was to fallon all the States Members of&apos; the League of Nationswe should, not. commit ourselves.    Tt must be realised,however, that the condition of co-operation by Franceand other countries in the event of an attack by Italymust be reciprocal, and that we should, be involved if,for example, Yugo-Slavia were attacked.    It would bedifficult for France to avoid coming to our aid, as inthat event she could not rely upon us if attacked byGermany.   M, Laval&apos;s vacillating attitude could hardly be maintained   because the strongest elements in theGovernment were led by F. Ferriot.    From the point ofview of economic sanctions it was pointed, out that france did not take much of the Italian exports, andthat from this point of view Rovjnania, Yugo-Slaviaand Switzerland * ere probably more important. Whatevermight be the material effect of such sanctions.
however   the psychological effect on Signer Mussoliniand the Italian people could not  fail to be very great.It was suggested that it was essential to try out themachinery of the League of Nations, and that any other course would he impossible to explain to the country.n-he contemplated test would be applied to the easiest,case 0f a. Great Power, and would, involve only themildest sanctions.    If it was successful, therefore,it we-ld graptly strengthen the League.    If it failed,then it would be a- well that we should kno&quot;r the weak-nftp,Sgg q-^ the League and consider how best the situation could be r? ct if ied.In favour of mild sanctions, which, however, the examination by the Advisory Committee on ^rade questions in mime of %r showed must include refusal of Italy*sexports to be effective, it was urged that they would,test out whether the Powers were genuinely attempting to apply the rules, so that their attitude would bedetermined before matters became serious.In reply to a request for information as to theprobable time-fable,  the Cabinet were informed thatthe Council woul-&apos; probably meet very shortly to receive a Be port from the Committee of Five *mfoe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidhis advice to the Minister for League of Nations affairs at Geneva would be not to allow himself or the Councilto be manoeuvred into a position of advocatingimmediate strong measures against Italy, as was likely to be urged in some quarters.    Our attitudeshould, be to try and &quot;moderate the position and leavethe doer open for further conciliation.    It was unlikelythat the Council vrould be able to find any nev methodof approach.    mhe Assembly was then libel;/ to take upthe question, and there would be some straight speaking.It was improbable that, the Council would formally
discuss sanctions or economic pressure until an aggression was actually committed, for the reason that unanimity was necessary, and. Italy would stillhe represented.    At that point &quot;e should have to make our position clear, which he understood would he thatif the Council was aareed on economic sanctions weshould he prepared to play our part,    &quot;&quot;he danger wouldhe that If economic sanctions did not  produce thene6ripri result there would he a clamour for more drasticxbeasures .fhe Prime Minister paid a. warm trid-u^e to the workof the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and expressed fha vie&apos;&apos;7 that the Cabinet agreed generally in the policy he had proposed,   We should not be facedwith a decision on sanctions until ah aggression had.been committed , and. even then no decision would betaken until we were ass tired as to the attitude of non-League .members of the &apos;   The- men on whom the decision restedwere experienced St-at esmen, who would onlv agree on.what was practicable.    It. was essential that signor mussolini should be made to know that any action he might take against us would be met equally by France.The rlak o&apos;&quot; isolated action against this country * interests &quot;&quot;as now much less probable.   He thought all were agreed that, the last thing that must be allowed.to happen would he a s ingle-handed war between thiscountry and Italy.   He asked the Cabinet to approvegenerally the draft reply contained in CP.-179 (35).The Cabinet, a.greed -(a) That the act ion taken by the Secretaryof Stats for Foreign Affairs since thelast  Cabinet Meeting should be approved,and that his advice should be adopted,namely, that our previous policy shouldbe cont. continued., that is to say, that weshould act in accordance with the statements made in Parliament and at.Geneva as to our intention to fulfilour obligations, but subject to the
conditions previously accepted as tokeeping- in step with the policy ofthe French Government, and avoiding any commitment which France was notequally prepared to assume:(h) That while at the moment no decision as to participation in sanctions wasbeing taken, before any formal economic or other s.auctions  could be entered on it would be necessarv to make sure ofthe whole-hearted support not only ofthe States Members       the League ofMat ions, but also to clear up. thepos it ion of the non-Member States andensure that they would not rendersanctions futile:    the last thing we desired was a single-handed war with italy    and before entering on sanctionswe must also have a clear understandingthat an isolated attack on British forces or interests was - an attack on all theMembers of the League, and as to full co-operation, by France, in oaft.leular :in that  event f See also f e) be 1 pw) t(c) that  on the French request for an assurance regarding the future Britishatt3tude in the event of a resort to force In Furope or of an infraction ofthe Covenant by another European power the draft reply contained in C.P.-179(7.5) should be approved, subject toan amendment to make clear that wereserved our attitude on the form inwhich Article IB should be applied:(d) that the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should be given liberty of action as to when and, how the Note should bed el ivered:(e) *?hat the Secr.et.arv of State for ForeignAffairs should, take the opportunity ofthe deliver&quot; 0&quot;** the above Note to address a ciuestion to the French Government inorder to clear up beyond doubt what theirattitude would, be if, arising out of the present e s e nt 6 1 s pi&apos;: t e, a n a t1 a ck s h ou 1 d b edelivered by Italy on the forces, t err it oror interests of this country in theMedit eTanean.
I ITALO-^cautionaryiasures.gviouseference:^inet 42 (35))2.      The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Secretary to the Cabinet (CP.  176 (35)),containing a summary of precautionary measures taken since the Meeting referred to in the margin.In the course of the discussion the FirstLord of the Admiralty reminded the Cabinet thatthe Navy was at the moment serving practicallyunder war conditions.      It had never been contemplated that the Home and Mediterranean Fleets could bebrought up to war strength without mobilisation,but this had been accomplished at the cost ofdenuding all the training schools.      Consequently,the Committee on Defence Policy and Requirementshad given permission to the Admiralty to call up some three thousand volunteers.      This could be doneindividually, without any proclamation and without involving much publicity.      He paid a tribute to the loyalty of the Press in not laying undue emphasis on the precautionary measures of the Admiralty.He emphasised that everything that had hitherto been done had been in the nature of precautionsfor our own security.      Action at the Suez Canalfell into a different category, and measures takenthere could not correctly be described asprecautions for our own security, a point to whichhe invited the attention of the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs.He then gave a brief appreciation of therelative strength of the British and ItalianFleets in the Mediterranean which is summarised below:-
British EmpireItaly,BattleshipsBattie-cruisersAircraft carriers8-inch Cruisers6-inch CruisersFlotilla LeadersDestroyersSubmarines(Includes 1 leavingUnited Kingdomshortly).2(At Gibraltar).2(Including 1 cruiserof R.A.N.  Two morecruisers are on passage from the China &amp;Australian stationsrespectively).10(including 3 at Gib-raltar and 2 leavingUnited Kingdom shortly).5411(Excludes 2 under-going long refit&amp; modernization).1710186562It was not quite certain that the Australian 8-inch cruiser could be used.      On paper the situation was not quite as good as was generally assumed though the battle-cruisers were a tremendous asset.      The most serious point was the lacx of British docking accommodation in theMediterranean which made it essential to have the use ofthe French ports.The position in the Red Sea was as followsBritish Empire. Italy.8-inch Cruisers6-inch Cruisers12Flotilla LeadersDestroyersSubmarinesSloops2(5* 9-inch)2O O45 2No more destroyers could be sent out without mobilisation.Tht; margin of safety in small&apos; craft was not much.In the event of Sanctions the position would not be a-12-
perhaps for a long timepleasant one.      The Fleet would he living/at war strength and practically under war conditions, andthere would probably be a demand from an uninformedpublic to use it.The First Lord informed the Cabinet that theSub-Committee on Defence Policy and Requirements had authorised the Admiralty to exchange information with the French Admiralty, subject to agreement withthe Foreign Office,  and action was about to be taken.In reply to a question he said that in the narrowwaters of the Mediterranean aircraft attack was aserious pre-occupation, especially as the anti-aircraftarmaments of the Fleet were not as much as could bewished.The Cabinet agreed:-(a) To take note of the defensive precautionstaken since their last   meeting as setforth in CP.  176 (35).(b) To invite the attention of the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs to thepoint mentioned by the First Lord of theAdmiralty as set forth above inconnection with the Suez Canal.

The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for India (0.P.-174 (35))seeking the general approval of his colleagues tothe introduction, at as early a date as possible,of a purely formal Bill to secure the reprintingof the G-overnment, of India Act as two separateActs, one -relating to India and the other to Burma.If the Cabinet approved the proposal, the Bill wouldbe circulated to the Committee of Home Affairs,and might be introduced in the house of Lords ifthis were likely to facilitate despatch.The Cabinet approved the above proposal.

The Cabinet took note of a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for India (C .P.-173 (35))  informinghis colleagues of eertaj.n action which, with theconcurrence of the Foreign Office, he had. authorised the Government of India to take in order to deal witha difficult situation which had arisen inthe country of the Mohmands on the Worth-West frontier of India.The action taken by the Secretary ofState for India described in theMemorandum was approved.

It had now become obvious that, there was no alternative to settlement in French, mandated territory in Syria, and the League Assyrian Committee would haveto find without delay a sum of possibly as much as 800,000.    It seemed essential, if any progress, wereto be made at Geneva,  that prior discussions should be entered into both with the French and Iraqi governments to induce the former to come to some arrangement whereby the capita. 1. sum to be found by the Assyrian Committeewould be substantially reduced, and the latter toincrease their offer of  125,000.   The whole schemethreatened to break down on the question of financeunless His Maiesty*s Government departed from theirpreviously declared attitude and gave a definite leadin the shape of an independent contribution.    OtherwiseHis Majesty&apos;s Government would be involved in in ca leu la-ble political and. financial liabilities.   Although therewas no question at the present stage of committing RisMajesty&apos;s Government to any definite figure, theSecretary of State and the Chancellor of the Fxchequerconsidered that., rs part of a satisfactory scheme. HisMajestyfs Government should make an independent contri-butlon up to a maximum of  250,000.   ^he necessity forannouncing that His Majesty&apos;s Government would ask parliament for a grant of this amount might rapidlyarise at Geneva, and the two Ministers trusted, that theCabinet would concur generally in the line of actionwhich they had already been obliged to initiate andwhich they proposed to follow in the ensuing negotia-tions.
The Cabinet approved the action takenby the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs and the Chancellor of theExchequer..
