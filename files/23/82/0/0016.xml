rjTp&quot;tp TTAI.O- 1, mhe Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsABYSSINIANpISPUTB. informed the Cabinet that he had seen the AmericanPossible Ambassador again and had derived a strong impressionInvocationof the Briand-   that the United States Government did not wish toKellogg Pact.take any initiative in invoking the Briand-Fellogg(Previous Pact in connection with the italo-Abyssinian dispute.Reference.Cabinet 4-5 In the circumstances he thought it advisable that(35), Con-clusion 1.)       Bis Majesty&apos;s Government, while keeping the matter inmind, should not press it at present.mhe Cabinet accepted this view.
Ift? XTAlO-edtheMediterranean.[tentativeroverturesSettlement.;legislation onsFith France.(?.revise ousRefer enbe:BaMnet 471(35), Gbn-j elusion 1 e)2. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that M. Laval*s answer to thequestion as t- whether,  if arising out of the appli-cation of sanctions the British forces in theMediterranean v.-ere attacked by Italy, France would co-operate, was very lengthy.    Re himself was clearthat the answer was sat is factory, so he did not propose to take up and reply to the various questionsmentioned in M. Lavalrs despatch, such as, forexample, the responsibility for the leakage that had occurred ,Ps then mentioned two connected questions that.had arisen:    first, the proposed military detentein the Mediterranean, and, second, the possibilityor an attempt at a settlement before sanctions came into operation.    His view was that while both ^rereimportant, the military detente should come first,as it would improve the atmosphere for discussing asettlement.    In this latter connection certaintentative proposals had been put forward from quarters in close touch with Signor Mussolini, including the vatican and a group of South American countries -While the tentative overtures that had been madewere somewhat vague, they were- an advance on any previous suggestions for a settlement.  .It was important to make clear from the first that any settlement must be within the framework of theLeague o,p Fations.    He had already instructed, the ambassador in Paris to tell M. Laval that he had seen, the reports of the Rome conversations, and tohint that we were prepared to discuss the matter,subject to the settlement being within the framework of toe League,   He had also sent an Official ofthe Foreign Office, who was an expert in Abyssinianaffairs, to assist the Ambassador in Paris.
So far as the proposed military detente in theMediterranean was concerned he proposed to press thematter as hard as possible.   He had. just heard thatthe Italian Government had decided to withdraw one division &quot;from Libya; and he would try and secure from Italy the withdrawal of another.   He would alsoinsist that the provocative attacks by the ItalianPress must cease,   The Committee on Defence Policyand Pequirements had decided that, no approach, shouldbe made to Italy until the position with Prance had.been cleared up.   Matters were moving so fast, how evethat he asked the Cabinet to authorise him to enterinto conversations with Italy at once, on the under-standing that he would not conclude any agreement for the proposed withdrawal of two Battle Cruisersfrom the Mediterranean until he had cleared theposition up with France and secured the use for theNavy of Toulon and. Bizerta in the case of Italianattack, and French acceptance of responsibility for control of the Western Mediterranean (outside the gibraltar area) as desired by the Admiralty.The First Lord of the Admiralty welcomed, thelatter assurance, as be felt .somewhat doubtful as towhether M. Laval&apos;s reply to our questions had. been as satisfactory as was generally assumed.    It was essential that specific undertakings should, be givenby the French Government as to the action they wouldtake in the event of an Italian attack in theMediterranean.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve generally the proposalsof the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs as summarised above,, includingprecedence     tto the questionof a military detente in the mediterranean in advance of, and as a preliminary to,thatof the overtures for a settlement of thed is put e:
(b) rj?o authorise the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs to enter intoconversations with the ItalianGovernment without waiting (asproposed by the Defence Policy and requirements Committee) until hehad obtained precis.? undertakingsfrom the French Government as totheir co-operation in the event ofan Italian attack on the British mediterranean fleet,, but that no agreement involving the withdrawal of the two battle cruisers from Gibraltar should be entered, into with Italy untilmatters were satisfactorily cleared up with the French Government:(c) That the Minister for league of WationsAffairs,  in his speech in. the Debate inParliament the same afternoon, shouldrepeat and. develop in greater detail the point made by the Secretary ofState for Foreign. Affairs the previous afternoon that, notwithstanding anyconversations that might take place with a view to a settlement of thes^,   Abyssinian dispute, nothing would besettle^ except within the framework of the League of nations:(d) ^at Ministers who had occasion torefer to the question in publicsoeeches could not emohasise too strongly the point mentioned in (c).

(f) That in connection with Proposal V(organisation of mutual support)the Minister for league of nations affair should take no decision without reference to the Chancellorof the Exchequer on financial matters and to the President of the Board ofTrade on trade matters:(g) That, notwithstanding the forthcomingGeneral Flection, it was desirable( that the Minister for League ofy  Nations  Affairs should, be at geneva on October 31st:\,(h) That    in view of the important stage-now being reached in sanctions, theChancellor of the Exchequer and thePresident of the Board, of Trade shouldeach nominate and. send, a senior Officialto assist the Minister for League ofNations Affairs at Geneva.

The Secretary of State for Air informed theCabinet that one of the Orders in Council to beissued under the Treaty of Peace Act, 1919, wouldhave the effect of preventing the forwarding of spare parts to Imperial Airways at Brindisi.    Itwould be very embarrassing if the whole of ourImperial Airways system were dislocated owing to theapplication of sanctions to Italy, but. he wf?s most reluctant to advise Imperial Airways to shift the base from Brindisi to Athens, especially at thepresent time when there were some signs of an Italiandesire for a settlement.It had hitherto been assumed that action wouldbe taken under the normal lieensing procedure, inwhich case a licence could have been given for spare parts ,The Cabinet were informed that the idea of proceeding under licence had. been dropped because it was thought it would, leave a loophole to certainnations for evasion of the Co-ordinating Committee&apos;sProposals.The Cabinet agreed----That in the event of unavoidablenecessity arising, means would befound, for meeting the difficultvra is ed by the secretary of Statefor Air.
JWw italo-; ^ygSlNIANfpropos edij^hite Paper.5, A suggestion was made that a White paper should be issued in order, more especially, to meetthe allegation that the British Government hadneglected to inform Signor Mussolini of our attitudetowards his dispute with Abyssinia until it. was too late.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thoughtit probable that later on the issue of a White Papermight become necessary,   &quot;his could not he donerapidly, however, as the tit most difficulty would arise at the present time in getting Italian assent to the reports of various conversations that had takenplace.&apos;  It would therefore have to await the newPar 1 iaro e nt.The Cabinet agreed -That the Minister for league ofNations Affairs should go intoas much detail as possible onthis aspect of the question inhis speech the same afternoon.

The Cabinet had before them a Note by theSecretary (-0;..?-..-194 (35))  containing a description of the procedure adopted during the last foxir general elections for the transaction of Government business during the period of the forthcoming Election.The Cabinet agreed:(a) That an Emergency Business committee composed of -The Prime Minister(for major questions only),The Lord President of the Council,The Lord Chancellor,The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The home Secretary,The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs,The Secretary of State for India,The First Lord of the admiralty,The President of the Board of Trade,together with any other Members of theCabinet who might be available,  andother Ministers according to the natureof the business, with a representativeof the Treasury in attendance -should form a nucleus(i)for handling(jLi)(iii)Cabinet business during the Election,  includingquestions of principle submittedby candidates to the party organisations;to make such arrangements as itmight think best for establishingliaison with the Party Organisa-tions concerned;to deal with ordinary cabinet business during the Election,unless it is of such importance as to render necessary the summoning of the full Cabinet.(b) That as at recent General Electionsa small Committee representative of theParty Organisations supporting theGovernment should be set up to preparedraft replies to questionnaires and tosubmit these replies, together with thequestionnaires;,  to the Cabinet Office.The Cabinet Secretariat would thenobtain the observations of the Depart-ments and submit the questionnaires,together with the replies suggested bythe Party Organisations and the Depart-ments, to the Cabinet Emergency business committee.-12-
(c)    That it was unnecessary to adopt theplan put in operation prior to theGeneral Election of 1929 under which an agreement was made between theprincipal Agents of the three Partiesthat candidates should be instructednot to reply to questionnaires fromOrganisations outside their constituency.
9.   The cabinet had before them the Report of the ministerial Committee on the Naval Conference, 1935(C.P.-201 (35)), which had met to review the courseof the preliminary Naval negotiations of the last(Previous twelve months and. to consider the steps now to be reference:Cabinet 36        taken in the matter.   The recommendations submitted.(35), Oon-conclusion 8.)       to the Cabinet by the Ministerial Committee were asfollows(i) That the qualitative limits aet out inSection II of the Joint Foreign Officeand. Admiralty Memorandum (Paper No.N.C .M.(35) 72) should he accepted if found tobe the best obtainable under the circum-stancesu(ii) That the British proposal for an agreementlimiting naval construction by mean?, of unilateral declarations for six years should, as a matter of tactics, be brought forward by His Majestyfs Government.    Inview, however, of the attitude of JapanFrance and Italy, it will probably beimpossible to reach any agreement at allon quantitative limitation.    In that   event it is important that the blame for thisdecision should be ma.de to rest on thethree Powers named and not on this country:That any future Treaty should include those provisions mentioned in the list inparagraph 27 of Paper No. N.C .M.( 35)72.That the provisions relating to the non-fortification of possessions in the Pacific(Article XIX of the Washington Treaty)should not be included as this question would best be left for separate treatment between the British Empire, the United.States and Japan:Civ) ^at agreement, should be sought with Japanalong the lines of Course (b) in paragraph53 of Paper No. N.C ,M.(35) 72.    failing this, agreement should be sought along thelines of Course (c), and, falling both these, resort should be made to obtaining a qualitative agreement without Japan, inwhich the signatory Powers would have theright to depart, from the limits laid downin the Treaty should Japan construct a vessel falling outside those limits:(v) That the Foreign Office should be authorisedto issue invitations to the signatory Powersof the Washington Treaty to a conference of ambassadors, with, authoritative naval repre-sentation, to open in London on the 2ndDecember, 1935:(vi) That before the Foreign Office issue theseinvitations, the Ambassadors in London forAmerica, Japan, France and Italy should, beinformed, that these invitations were about to be issued.-14-fjtS t-jaFAL CON-PKRFNCE,  1935.Report ofMinisterialfi (jnrfp it tee.(ill)
After hearing an explanation by the FirstLord of the Admiralty, the Cabinet agreed:(a) To approve the recommendations ofthe Ministerial Committee inCo P.  201 (35) as set forth above.(bj That the British Delegates at theConference should put forward onceaore the whole programme of Navallimitation of armaments, includingthe proposal for quantitative limi-tation and the abolition of submarines,even though they recognised thatthere was no prospect of obtainingagreement.(c) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should send formal invitations to the Conference the same day.(d) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should make an announcement in the House of Commons that invitationshad been sent in reply to a private notice Question on the next day.
PROGRAMME OPjpW NAVALOBSTRUCTIONOR 19 35-pio (jvl previous reference:Cabinet. 12(35), Con-clue ion 8.)10. The Cabinet bad before there a Memorandum bythe First Lord of the Admiralty (CP.-198 (35))  onthe subject of the Programme of New Naval Construc-tion for 1935.    Fe recalled the proposal he had submitted at the Meeting referred to in the margin,to substitute for the usual Flotilla of a Leaderand eight Destroyers, a Flotilla of seven Leaders,to which the Chancellor of the Exchequer had raisedno objection.    The First Lord, was now convinced,however, after anxious consideration of our require-ments in the light of all that had since happened,that both Flotillas ought to be included in the 1935Programme.   He felt certain that on making thenecessary statement in. the I-Tou.se of Commons as tothe alteration approved last March, he would be facedwith widespread demands for the inclusion of bothFlotillas, and he would much prefer to anticipatesuch demands than seem merely to vield to them.The Chancellor of the Pxchecuer concurred in thepresent proposal, for which the First Lord soughtCabinet approval.   -he proposal could, then be announced In the new Parliament as a part or a first instalment of the Government&apos;s general defence programme.The Cabinet agreed:(a) To approve the inclusion in the1935 Programme of Naval Constructionof a Flotilla of seven DestroyerLeaders in addition to the usualFlotilla of one Leader and eight destroyers which had already beenapproved by Parliament.(b) That it would not be possible toobtain Parliamentary approval until after the assembly of the new parliament, and that,  in thesecircumstances, no announcement couldbe made at present.
To take note that the Admiralty hadallotted two of the new Cruisers todistressed areas on the Tyne and Clyderespectively, and that within thenext two days orders Yi/ould he placed for Destroyers affecting some ofthose areas.

The Cabinet had before them a Report by theAir Raid Precautions (Policy)  Sub-Committee of theCommittee of Imperial Defence (C.P.-202 (35))  on thesubject of Policy in regard to Respirators,  in whichthe following recommendations were made to enableanswers to be given to questions raised by the air raid Precautions (Organisation) Sub-Committee inparagraph 10 of their Report (Paper Wo. A.R.P.(P) 42) s-(i) That it is necessary to ensure that atthe outbreak of war respirators should,be available in all parts of the countryliable to air attack, for all personsnot in possession of special, respirators.Special respirators are those which are designed for, and issued to, all personnelwho are actively engaged in carrying outair raid precautions measures :(ii) That the necessary stocks of respiratorsshould, be accumulated by the Government,and. at the cost of the Government:(ill) That if and when an emergency arises,respirators should be issued free of charge.The Home Secretary informed the Cabinet thatgreat public interest was taken in this question incertain districts and especially in the east of London.Questions had been asked as to whether air raidprecautions would give protection to the rich andnot to the poor.      He did not suggest an announcement in Parliament at present, but if the question was raised at Election time an appropriate reply mightbe that a simple and appropriate respirator had been designed, and in the event of air raids would beprovided free to all persons in areas liable.to attack.This a night be brought to the attention, of theCommittee -referred to in Conclusion 8.The Cabinet approved the proposals of theAir Raid Precautions (Policy) Sub-Committeeof the Committee of Imperial Defence asset forth in CP. 202 (55) and reproducedabove.

October,but- the proviso in the Statutory Committee&quot;recommendation imposing a limit to theamount of benefit that may be drawnby a claimant should be omitted from theOrder, in view of the lack of parliamentary time for adequate discussion.The Report also submitted that the Ministerof Labour should be invited to consultagain with the Unemployment assistance board as to the necessity for applying the increased rates to the calculation of payments under the &quot;standstill&quot;:Further, that care should be taken, inany statement or answer to questions,not to imply that the increases will necessarily apply to payments tinder the&quot;standstill&quot;.
The Cabinet heard statements by the Minister ofLabour and the Chancellor of the Exchequer and devotedclose attention to the Reports and more particularly tothe Appendices.Appendix Bs dealing with the Means Test, came infor a certain amount of discussion, and more particularly the last sentonces which reads as follows:-&quot;If there are cases of proved hardship they willbe met and nothing will he done that could fairly he alleged to break up family life.&quot;The last eight words were felt tobe liable to misconstruction,       and the first wordsscasting doubt on whether there were cases of proved hard-ship, would, it was felt, be criticised.One suggestion was to reverse the sentence so asto read somewhat as follows:-*&apos;The importance of unity in the family life is fully recognised and cases of proved hard-ship will be met. &quot;The Cabinet agreed:-(b) That the Minister of Labour shouldredraft Appendix B in thelight of the Cabinet discussion.

Hehad been especially influenced by the conclusions -of the Committee in regard to trading estates,,credit for new industries and certain public worksschemes, including afforestation and the severn bridge    as well as by the belief that the Committeehad decided to invite the Commissioners to make
recommendations to the appropriate departments for supplementary grants to local authorities in suitable cases.       He   now found that on the last point theCommittee&apos;s recommendation was the reverse of what he had understood;, and that the other points were stated in so tentative a form as to deprive them of most of their value.      He also dissented from thediscouraging view taken in the Report of the prospects of new industries.
