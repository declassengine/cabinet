; IRE ITALO-ABYSS IN IANDISPUTE.Anglo-french conversations .proposed.Embargo on oil supplies for Italy.Propose^ Basisof Peace Dis-cus?ions .(previous reference:Cabinet(35), Con-conclusion     )The Cabinet held a Special Meeting to considerthe following documents in connection with the Ital)-Abyssinian dispute:-A Note by the Minister for League ofNations Affairs (CP.-233 (35))covering a Record, of a Conversationheld in Paris on Saturday, December 7,1935, between the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs and M. Laval:A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs (CP.-235(35)) giving an account of the ParisConversations, together with urgentrecommendations as to the action tobe taken.   Attached to the memorandum was a note on Procedure, and   . suggesteddraft telegrams to Rome outliningproposals which the United Kingdomand, French Governments proposed tosubmit to the Committee of Five atGeneva as a basis of negotiation fora settlement of the dispute:A Memorandum by the President of theBoard of Trade (CP.-236 (35)) onthe subject of oil supplies for Italy,annexing a memorandum by the Anglo-Iranian&quot;&quot; Oil Company and the ShellGroup, which made it clear that theCompanies do not consider that a voluntary limitation of shipments to Italy could be effected, andthat in their view they would incurreal risks in Italy if by their ownvoluntary action they endeavoured to restrict shipments.   A Memorandum bythe Petroleum Department of the Boardof Trade was also attached, bringingup to date the information containedin Annex I to CP.-212 (35) .x   A revised version of the Annexes to the note was circulated, shortly before theMeeting.The Prime Minister informed, the Cabinet that theMeeting had been summoned, at the request of theSecretary of State for Foreign A^ffairs .    In a shortletter (which the Prime Minister read to hiscolleagues) covering his Memorandum and its Annexesthe Secretary of State had strongly recommended, thathis proposals should be adopted.   The Prime ministers aid that both the President of the Board, of Tradeand the First Lord of the Admiralty were absent throughindisposition.   The latter ha.d. informed, him that he supported the recommendations of the Foreign Secretary
The Minister for League of Nations Affairs asked the Cabinet to agree to two amendments to theproposed procedure .    It had been arranged at the paris conversations that Signor Mussolini should beinformed in full of the proposals to be submitted tothe Committee of Five at Geneva by the British andFrench Governments as a basis for discussion, andshould be asked to agree to them in principle, andthe Emperor of Abyssinia was to be notified in an appropriate form that this attempt at peace wasbeing made and that the Abyssinians would have thefullest opportunity of explaining their positionto it at the Committee of Five.   As the new proposals went in some respects a good deal further than the earlier proposals of the Committee of Five,in so much as they involved exchanges of territory in the North . as well as in the South and east of Abyssinia, it seemed fairer to the Emperorto treat him exactly the same as Signor Mussoliniand send him the whole proposals.   His Majesty1 ambassador in Paris had agreed to this suggestion,and it was hoped that he and Sir Robert Vans.ittart(who was in Paris) would be able to arrange this with the French Government.   A second point ofprocedure which, after mentioning it to the PrimeMinister, he had asked Sir Robert Vansittart toarrange, was that, instead of postponing theMeeting of the Committee of Eighteen on December12th, which the British and French Governments hadno authority to do, the Meeting should take place as arranged and the British and French representa-tives should state that they were engaged on a peace effort and ask the Committee to refer thematter to the Committee of Five (Spain, the UnitedKingdom, Prance, Turkey and Poland).   That,admittedly, increased the risk of leakage, but,
as the French had already allowed the proposals to leakout into their Press, this did not much matter.      If thecourse he now proposed were adopted, the Committee of eighteen would probably adjourn, and the question of the oil sanction would be postponed.      The Minister for Leagueof Nations Affairs then explained the Paris proposals withthe aid of maps, which were handed round.      He emphasised that the proposed exchange of territory in the North would bethe hardest for the Emperor of Abyssinia to accept, but hewould receive compensation in an outlet to the sea;    and he pointed out the extent of the territory that it was proposedto include in the area for economic development, thewhole of which, however, was non-Amharic.      He added thathe had received a personal message from M. Laval to theeffect that at Geneva he would want to interpret the proposals as generously as possible for Signor Mussolini.    He thenadded certain details of the proposals that he had gathered from Mr, Maurice Peterson, of the Foreign Office, who hadbeen present at the Paris discussions.      The Minister for league of Nations Affairs, while supporting the foreign secretary&apos;s proposals, felt bound to warn his colleagues that some features of the proposals were likely to prove verydistasteful to some States Members of the League of Nations,including States represented on the Committee of Five.He mentioned&apos;also that M. Laval, while stating that france would honour her obligations to the League and its member states in the event of an Italian aggression as the resultof further sanctions, had made clear in the conversationsthat sanctions were unpopular to an important section ofFrench public opinion.      This, which had perhaps influencedthe Foreign Secretary, raised doubts as to whether ,in the event, active French co-operation could be relied on,particularly if Signor Mussolini should accept the proposal/but the Emperor of Abyssinia
should refuse.    If the League of Nations as well asthe Emperor should reject the proposals the french attitude was hard to forecast.The proposals were discussed by the Cabinet at some length.    It was recognised that if Italy, Abyssiniaand the League should all accept the proposals as abasis for discussion the position would be satis factor,?as conforming to the declared policy of the Government.If Italy and the League should accept, but Abyssiniashould refuse, the position would be more difficult,as France would feel justified in refusing to co-operate in further sanctions or their consequences.If both the League and Abyssinia should reject theproposals, while Italy accepted them as a basis, theposition would be one of uncertainty and difficulty.In that event the first thing to be done would be to try and negotiate for a more acceptable basis;    butthe possibility was recognised of an undesirableposition arising in which the League was divided onthe ques&apos; ion of sanctions and of our having to decide whether we would still adhere to our recommendationof this proposal.The Smperor, it was pointed out, was unlikely togive a definite acceptance of the proposal, even asa basis of discussion;   he was likely at least to askfor an Italian withdrawal from occupied territory or an armistice   and that would raise the difficult question of whether the present economic sanctionscould be maintained during an.armistice.    It wassuggested that economic sanctions, once raised,  could never be reimposed.   These, however, were felt to beproblems for the future.Among criticisms of the actual proposals were thatthey were better for Italy than those of the Committeeof Five?    that it would be said that Italy&apos;s resort to force had gained her more than she could have
obtained otherwise;    that the suggested CharteredCompany was rather a dubious proposition: and thatthe sphere of economic exploitation for Italy wasunduly extended.   On the other hand the proposals fella good deal short of what Signor Mussolini had demandedin the summer.The question was raised as to why the proposals had not been sent to the League of Nations before they were sent to Italy, and whether this could notstill be done-    It was suggested that M. Laval had probably thought it more advantageous from the pointof view of Signor Mussolini&apos;s amour pro pre, to send the proposals to him in the first instance.   proposals from the United Kingdom and France were far more likely to receive favourable consideration from signor mussolini than if they emanated from the League.There were, it was suggested, obvious advantages in getting the assent of the two parties, if this couldbe done, before submitting proposals to the League,and everything possible should be done to secure this .There was general agreement in the proposal of theMinister for League of Nations Affairs that theproposed pea.ce terms ought to be communicated toAbyssinia at the same time as to Italy, and that theEmperor should be strongly pressed to accept them asa basis for discussion, or at least not to reject them.The fact that the terms had leaked out in the ParisPress made this indispensable.   Mi Laval&apos;s agreement to a telegram to Abyssinia ought, it was urged, tobe obtained the same evening, and our agreement inthe draft telegram to Italy ought to be made condi-tional on his acceptance of this .Towards the end. of the discussion the Secretaryof State for Air informed the Cabinet that, from such slight information as he had received by
telephone from Paris, the conversations on air co-operation -operation were not proceeding very favourably.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To support the policy of the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs as set-forth in his Memorandum (CP.-235 (35))and the (amended) Annexes:(b) To approve the modification of procedure proposed by the Minister for League ofNations&apos; Affairs with the object ofsecuring the support of the League ofNations to the basis for discussion as soon as possible:    that is to say,that the Meeting of the Committee ofFighteen at Geneva should take placeon December 12th, as already arranged,and that the British and french representatives should inform theCommittee generally of the positionand invite it to refer the examinationof the peace proposals to the Committeeof Five.   Meanwhile it was assumed thatthe decision on the Oil Sanction wouldbe adjourned:(c) To authorise the Minister for Leagueof Nations Affairs (in the absence ofthe Foreign Secretary) to despatch the(revised) draft telegram (annexed to cp.-235 (35)) to Rome, provided that asimilar telegram is sent by France andthis country to Abysginia:(d.) To ask the Minister for League ofNations Affairs to take immediate steps to obtain the agreement of theFrench Government to fc), and to pointout to them that, as the proposed basis for discussion had leaked out in theFrench Press, it is impossible to makea communication to one party and notto the other;(e) That, when the proposed ba^is isforwarded to Addis Ababa, a message should be sent to the British Ministerasking him to do his best to induce the Emperor to accept, or at least notto reject it out of hand:(f) That the Meeting of the Cabinet onWednesday, December 11th, should beheld at 10 a.m. in order to afford an opportunity for further discussionof these matters in the light of thelatest developments before the departure of the Minister for League of nations affair for Geneva.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.:/F.lDecember 9, 1935.
