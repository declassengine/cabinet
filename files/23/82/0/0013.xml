The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that at Geneva the course ofevents had been smoother than he had anticipated.The abstentions he had. apprehended at the council had not materialised, and. there had. been no oppositionto the/In accordance with his suggestion, the President ofthe Assembly had sxTmrnoned that body to meet todayto support the attitude of the Council.   The next stepwas likely to be a Joint Committee of the Council andthe Assembly to consider sanctions.    He himself had consulted the Minister for League of Nations affairs and M. Laval as to whether it was desirable that heshould attend the Meeting of the Assembly.   He wasgiven to understand, however, that there would be noresounding speeches at the Assembly   which would merely set up the Joint Committee to which he had justreferred.    As M. Laval was not summoning the french delegation to Geneva the Secretary of State did. not propose to attend., but was ready to proceed there at short notice.The Secretary of State then gave accounts ofinterviews he had. had with the French,American andItalian Ambassadors in London, particulars of whichhad. been, or are to be,  circulated.   At his interview with the French Ambassador he had protested againstthe attitude of the French Press and the fact thatno public man, in spite of opinions expressed in private, had made in France a proper public presenta-tion of the British attitude.    Sfo^foio........$i&amp;lpeaw4few Hehad a4**y(reoeived the answer of the French Governmentto the British request for co-operation in the eventof an attack on a Power in consequence of the applica-tion of sanctions.   ^be French reply was probablyintended to be satisfactory, but the Secretary of State
titindicated two points on which doubts arose and onwhich he proposed to make further enquiries.His communications with the American ambassador had been particularly satisfactory.   mhey had begunlate on Saturday evening with a message transmittedfrom the American Secretary of State, who had notifiedhim that the President proposed to issue a neutralityproclamation at once and intended to add to it the warning that persons trading with belligerents would do so at their risk, but had wanted to know firstwhether it would embarrass our position at Geneva.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs had sont.warm thanks, and had indicated that it would be useful if the President acted at once.    On the previous day the American Ambassador, on the strength of a message from President Roosevelt, had said that the UnitedStates, so far as they could, wanted to co-operate,nd tho......Proa id ant ^report od . that .he/had rarely/knownaa matter on which public opinion in the United states was so unanimous as the condemnation of Italy.Although war material only had been included in the embargo, the President        prepared to go furtherif/the league did so.   The Secretary of State hadgathered that even cotton might be included.   the ambassador had also stated that the American imports and Exports Rank had been, ordered not to give anycredits to, or to the advantage of,    Italy.   He had learned that the President of the United States wasalso thinking of mobilising the signatories of theKellogg Pact against Italy and was willing to discussthe method, of doing so.     This was interesting for thereason that it would facilitate co-operation byGermany and Japan, as well as canalise American opinion.   The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs had not yet had time to formulate advice to theCabinet as to how best to follow up this matter.-2-
The Italian Ambassador had wanted to see himlast Thursday, but this had. proved impossible, and.the Ambassador had seen Sir Robert Vansittart andhad given him a general outline of certain proposals by Signer Mussolini.   Although the interview had.taken place at 12 Noon on Thursday, by which time theItalian offensive had begun and Adowa had. been bombed,the Ambassador had made no reference to these matters.When he himself saw the Ambassador on Friday theSecretary of State had referred to this and had pointed, out the difficulties of discussing any proposals while the Italian forces were bombingwomen and children.   Moreover, the further theypenetrated into Abyssinia the harder would negotia-t-ions become.    The Ambassador had read a long private letter from Signor Mussolini, in the first part ofwhich he had. tried, to indicate how little we under-stood the Italian position, and had suggested some kind of negotiations&apos;    and in the second part ofwhich he had suggested some measure of demobilisation-in the Mediterranean.The Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should receive any Italianovertures for negotiations for a settle-ment outside the League of Nations verycoolly at the present time and. treatthem with caution:    in any event he must receive detailed proposals beforethe possibility of entering into nego-tiations could, be considered:Thai in regard to proposals for measuresof demobilisation in the Med it erran eanthe Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should&quot; make clear that we had only sentthere a bare minimum of naval and otherforces for defensive purposes:    thatthere could be no question of diminishingthese forces, and we might have to sendfurther r einforc ements to Egypt *   If,however, Signor Mussolini was prepared,to withdraw the large reinforcementshe had sent to Libya we&quot; would cancel the despatch of&apos;reinforcements to Egypt.(V)

The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs suggested that the Minister for league of FattensA.ffairs should be instructed to raise the questionof the arms embargo at the new Joint Committee ofthe Assembly and Council to .be set up at Geneva, andthat his aim should be to obtain a collective decision which would probably mean a raising of the arms embargo in the case of Abyssinia.The Cabinet were reminded, that the removal  ofthe arms embargo was liable to raise the questionof belligerent rights, on which they were given tounderstand, that, the Foreign Office and admiralty had not yet reached agreement.    A suggestion was made mtK. itt lifiti&amp;u. I that the^uer-b-lon might be referred to the Law officers Q-dimaM^ j) of the Crown.^he Secretary of State said &quot;his information wasthat Italy was not likely to take any action thatwould raise the question of belligerent rights.The Cabinet were reminded that we ourselves might in the future wish to exercise belligerent rightsand ought to be very careful, as to how the matter wast r eat ed .The Prime&apos; Minister informed his colleagues thatthe question, of belligerent rights was on the agenda for the Sub-0orom.ittee on Defence Policy and. Require-in ent a at a Meeting to be held the same afternoon.The Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary of State forForeign /affairs should beauthorised to deal with the Arm??!Embargo on the basis of obtaining a collective decis ion.

The Secretary of State for Air informed theCabinet that the United States Government had includedaeroplanes in their embargo and that we should probably have to do the same.The Cabinet agreed  fa) That if aeroplanes should be includedin the arms embargo,, this should bedone by simply withdrawing licencesfrom Italy and. not by the more cumbrousmethod of first withdrawing all licences and then granting them for countries other than Italy:(b) that the Secretary of State for air should send a Memorandum to theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs -which the latter could forward to the Minister for league of nations affair.
rnfftf ITALO- 4. The Cabinet had before them a Meraorandtsm by thenVgptF-B.       Secretary of State for the Colonies (C .P.-1S8 (35))SrPPlv of     on the question whether, if it is decided to imposeGonmoditiesto the certain financial and economic sanctions on Italy -underItalianColonies in Article XVI of the Covenant, there should be includedT?ast Africa.among such sanctions measures to restrict or prohibiti-previotiS     the direct supply of commodities by States Members ofRef erpncp;Cabinet *4 the League to the Italian Colonies in Past Africa, e,g.,(35), Con-conclusion i. Commodities the export of which to Italy itself wouldnot be restricted or prohibited under the sanctionsthecontemplatad   but which were being imported into/italian colonies in Past Africa in abnormal quantities, chieflyfor the support of the Italian armies engaged there.If the States Members of the League decided, to take special action   in this matter it would presumably benecessary to prohibit all direct trade with these colonies, unless on humanitarian grounds a distinctionwere made between (i) the supply of foodstuffs and water for human beings and animals, which would be allowed,and (ii) the supply of all other commodities, whichwould, be prohibited .The Secretary of State for the Colonies pointedout that although the supplies concerned, would be with-held as the result of collective action, the chiefburden go--far ao &apos;food^t\tffO&apos;^woro -Q&amp;jq-e*s3me4. would fallon the Past African Colonies, who at present were doingvery good business.   Prohibition of exports to theItalian Colonies would, undoubtedly embarrass theItalians to some extent, but would have a -SmmI effecton the trade of our Colonies, /there might possibly be room for an exception in the case of water and evenfoodstuffs on humanitarian grounds   feut apart fromthis he thought it would, be very difficult, when wewere co-operating in the application of sanctions, toallow this trade to continue.   He placed less emphasis
on the importance of stopping the trade as a sanctionthan on the moral aspect.    It would be difficult todefend the continuance of this trade either here orin the Colonies, where the native population alreadyshowed signs of concern.It was suggested, that if water from Aden was tobe stopped, the export of distilling machines from -r eat Br it a in sh ou. Id also be a t opp ed .In support of the proposed prohibition theCabinet were reminded that the object of the League&apos;transaction was to stop the fighting in Abyssinia.    Oneof the most effective methods was to prohibit all exports, except possibly water and food, to the armies in the field./The Cabinet were reminded, however, that theprohibition of these exports to the Italian colonies would be more of a gesture than a form of pressure,since the Italians could purchase the same produce and material elsewhere and ship them from Italy totheir Colonies, so that there would only be some delay,extra cost and extra transport in the way ofadd iti ona1 pressure.The suggestion was made that the League wouldhave to consider exports to Italy commodity by commodities-dity,   There was no real difference between shippingan article from (say) Mombasa to Eritrea and shipping the same article from Czechoslovakia via Trieste toEritrea.   -&quot;Tie proper course, therefore, was to decide whether a particular article was to be allowed toreach Italy at all, the colonies being considered aspart of Italy.   This suggestion met with much support,but the comment was made that there was a differencebetween shipping direct to the seat of war, where theimports were unabashedly for the use of the army,and to Italy where there was a presumption at least
that the article might be required for the civilian population.Tn connection with a proposal that the matter should be discussed, in the first instance with theFrench President of the Council it was pointed outthat France and other nations would certainly want usto prohibit export from our Colonies to the seat ofwar since they themselves would not be affected bythe prohibition at all.The Cabinet agreed.  That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should send to theMinister for League of Nation Affairsan account of the Cabinet&apos;s discuss ion,pointing out the difficulties andinstructing him, if and when the, question arose, to take no decisionbut to refer it to London:   he shouldbe on his guard against any decision by the Leag\:e of Nations which would- militate against this country alone.

The Cabinet had before them a ProvisionalReport (CP.  186(35)) on the forms of Economic andFinancial Sanctions applicable to the present crisiain connection with the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, sub-mi tted by the Advisory Committee of the Committeeof Imperial Defence on Trade Questions in Time ofWar,   in accordance with the Cabinet conclusion mentioned in the margin.After discussing the Report in some detail andintroducing a number of amendments to the conclusions(incorporated below),  the Cabinet agreed :-(a)    To approve the Provisional Conclusionssubmitted by the Advisory Committee on trade Questions in Time of War in thefollowing am.end.ed form :-(i)    That His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould agree to continue the embargo on the export of armsand munitions to Italy;(ii)    That,  subject to Conclusion (b)(ii)below- His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould concur in any proposal that Member States should -(a) Prohibit loans and credits to Italy;(b) Collect trade debts due toItaly to liquidate tradedebts due by Italy.They should NOT at present (enceptby way of reprisal) interfere withbank balances or other propertyof Italians, nor with financialpayments due to Italy, nor withmarine or other insurance.    this conclusion   should NOT be announced;(iii)    That His Majesty&apos;s Government shouldbe prepared, in agreement withother Member States,  to impose an embargo on all imports from Italy;(iv)    That His Majesty&apos;s Government shouldbe prepared, if the proposal ispressed by other Governments,  tojoin in an examination of theproposal not to allow Italian mer-chant vessels to make use of Leagueports;
(v)   That if oil producing or supplyingMember States, such as roumania, wereprepared to impose en embargo on exports of oil, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would, be prepared tojoin in this and to consider furtheran embargo on exports of coal;(vi)   That His Majesty&apos;s Government should only concur in a proposal for an embargo on the export of essentialmaterials to Italy at the request ofother Member States;(vii)   That His Majesty&apos;s Government shouldbe prepared,  in agreement with other-Member States,  to prohibit the sale or chartering of ships to Italy;(viii)   That His Majesty&apos;s Government shouldnot accept proposals for the sus-pension of postal communications;(ix)   That,  so far as possible, agreement should be reached with, other member states as to the details of theoperation of any proposals adopted,and not only on the principles,(b)    That the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should communicate the above provisional conclusions to the Minister for League ofNations Affairs and should advise him, so faras he might deem necessary of any points mentioned in the discussion which wouldspecially interest him or bear on the inter-pretation to be given to the conclusions.Among the points which the Secretary of state was asked to mention were the following :-(i)   The importance to Italy of the tourist traffic (said to be worth 30 millions a year) from thepoint of view of the balance oftrade.    The British Tourist traffic to Italy was believed to have sunkalmost to vanishing point and itmight be useful for the League todo anything it could further toreduce the international tourist traffic to Italy;(ii)   That if the proposal in Conclusion (a)-  ill) should arise at Geneva. theMinisterfor League of NVtions Affairs   should reserve it for the Chancellor of the Exchequer;(iii)   That, as regards Conclusion (a)(ili)above, the original proposal of theSub-Committee had been that HisMajesty&apos;s Government should be pre-pared, in agreement with at leastFrance and preferably with other member States,  to impose an embargo on all imports from Italy.      Theobject of this proposal had been toput pressure on other nations to do
the same and, by force of example,to avoid delays.    The Cabinet&apos;view was that we should stickclosely to the principle of collectivesanctions and they had,  therefore/amended the Report in this respect;(iv)    That the Cabinet had the gravest doubts about the advisability of provisionalC onelus i on (iv H ab ove.    S oraethinglike 60 per cent,   of the ports ofthe world were affected,  and to closethem to Italian shipping, especiallyin case of bad weather, would hehad pointed out. that all thesesanctions increased risks to peace and, consequently, put a strain onthe naval forces in the Mediterranean,and. both they and the President ofthe Board of Trade would prefer thatthe proposal not to allow Italianmerchant ships to make use of Leagueports should not be adopted;(v)   That in regard to Conclusion (v) a).we should not agree to impose an embargo on exports of coal    to Italyunless corresponding action was tai-conby other States concerned in coal exports and by Member States suchas Roumania who were concerned in exports of oil.      The idea of agreeing to an embargo on coal exports as an example and an inducement to Roumaniato withhold oil did not commend itselfto the Cabinet.    Although coal ex-ports to Italy had. fallen owing toItaly&apos;s inability to pay,  it had tobe remembered that an embargo would,put more miners out of work.    Itwould, also involve a proclamation,and the increase in unemployment would be laid at the door of theGovernment.&apos;        Importance was attached,therefore,  to the presentation ofthe embargo on coal,  and. the cabinet felt it would be of advantage if itcould be accomplished in some mannerwithout a proclamation;(vi)    That the imposition of the sanctionsmentioned in these conclusions must(c)    That the idea of withdrawing diplomatic representatives from the capital had, inthe past, proved futile and embarrassingend an obstacle to re-establishing dip-lomatic communication when the proper timearrived.

Defence Policy and Requirements wouldin due course come before the Cabinet .The Chancellor of the Exchequer said, that as thesubject of. Defence Policy had hitherto been dealt withby Committees, he was crlad that the Cabinet had beeninformed as to the position.   Re himself wanted to besure that he and some of his colleagues, in alludingto the subject in public speeches, were interpretingthe views of all their colleagues . - After recallingthe various stages of Defence Requirements he mentioned that a position, had been reached a few weeks ago whenthe Committees felt that the programmes for the navy and the Army, in particular, which the Cabinet hadallowed to fall behind the Royal Air Force, requiredspeeding up.   Finance had. been, the governing reasonfor the two older Services falling behind, but now the state of the world was such that financial considerations might have to be rev1 owed in a differentlight.    Fe then gave some particulars as to the methods by which an Increased programme might be financed, and asked his colleagues,  in making speeches, to avoid any suggestion of a Loan.
The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs asked that Ministers speaking on Defence Requirements shouldhe careful to keep within the framework of ourthatinternational peace policy and/-the desirability of cutting down the standard of international armamentswhenever that might be possible should not be over-looked.The Cabinet took note of the Secretary&apos;sReport attached to C.F.-1S?
