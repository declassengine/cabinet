p:4? ITAhO-ABYSS IN IANDISPUTE.Anglo-french conversations .Proposed.^Embargo on%1 supplies for I$aly.Proposed Basisof Peace Dis-cussions .(previous reference:Cabinet 52(35).)The Cabinet held a Special Meeting, summoned at short notice, to consider the Record of a Conversationin Paris between the Permanent tinder-Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs and M. Laval (Foreign office telegram No .25?) in which M. Laval defined his attitudetowards the imposition of an oil sanction.   \VhatM. Laval wanted, was an engagement between the UnitedKingdom and French Governments that if the peace proposals already accepted, by them were refused, byAbyssinia with a view to bringing an oil sanctioninto play, fresh sanctions against Italy should notbe imposed.On the suggestion of the Prime Minister, Mr MauricePeterson, of the Foreign Office, who had attended the paris discussions, was present during the Meeting.The Minister for League of Nations Affairs reminded the Cabinet that even before the Meeting on theprevious evening he had warned Sir Robert Vansittart(in Paris) that the Cabinet would probably make thepoint that Abyssinia as well as Italy should beinformed in detail of the proposed basis for diseus-sion.   After the Cabinet had taken the decision tothat effect on the previous evening he had immediatelycommunicated by telephone with Sir Robert Vansittart(in Paris), who at first had anticipated no great difficulties with the French Government.   After dinner,however. Sir Robert Vansittart had reported that liewas, encountering difficulties and that the FrenchGovernment strongly pressed that the Abyssiniansshould be sent a shorter account of the proposals.The Minister for League of Nations Affairs had repliedthat this was a Cabinet decision, reached after careful consideration, that a partial account toAbyssinia, would not suffice, for the reason that what had been proposed went further than the proposals ofthe Committee of Five.   Sir Robert Vansittart had telegraphed again shortly after midnight,- to the-1-
effect that if the French accepted our point of viewthey would expect that we should agree that the oil embargo sanction should not be accepted at Geneva.The Minister for League of Nations Affairs had repliethat he could not possibly give such an assurancewithout consulting the Prime Minister and probablyobtaining Cabinet approval.   Moreover, he could not see how such a plan would work out in practice.For example, the Italian reply might be of anequivocal nature which the French would interpretdifferently from ourselves .   Sir Robert Vansittarthad seen M. Laval at 2 a.m. and had sent his telegramNo .257 (Appendix I) .    In reply to a question theMinister for League of Nations Affairs added thatM, Laval had good reasons for believing thatAbyssinia would refuse the offer.In the discussion that followed, the Cabinet were reminded that the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs had again and again emphasised that we would accept anything that all three parties to this dispute would accept, namely, Italy, Abyssinia andthe League of Nations .    It was suggested that thedice were now being loaded against Abyssinia andthe League of Nations, and that Italy was being putinto a privileged position.   This might involve theGovernment in a difficult situation.In this connection the Prime Minister said hehad received the following Private Notice question from Mr Attlee&quot;To ask the Prime Minister whether,before any further action is taken,this House will, be informed of thenature of the proposals for thesettlement of the Italo-Abyssinianwar to which Pis Majesty&apos;s Govern-&apos;ment is committed.&quot;The Minister for League of Nations Affairs1reported that the Press were asking for guidance,
Government had agreed to any proposals.After some discussion the Minister for League ofNations Affairs handed round the attached draft telegram to Sir Robert Vansittart as a basis fordiscussion appendix II).   To this he added thefollowing further paragraph&quot;In the meantime M. Laval may be assured that should Italy acceptthe proposed basis of settlement and abyssinia refuse  , His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would neither proposenor support the imposition offurther sanctions upon Italy unlessfurther developments had modifiedthe situation.&quot;After discussion, this addition did not commend itself to the Cabinet, and the following alternative was suggested by the Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot;If Italy accepts and Abyssiniarefuses, ^is Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould neither propose nor supportthe imposition of further sanctionsat once or before it is clear thatno chance remains of a settlement byagreement.    But they would notPledge themselves to   opposefurther sanctions for all time or in new conditions which cannot now be foreseen.&quot;generalTnis draft met with the&apos; approval of the Cabinet.In a discussion of the Minister for League ofNations Affairs&apos;  draft there was general agreement that the description on page 2 of the contingency of Italy refusing as being &quot;remote11 should be omitted.   A good deal of discussion took place as to what the position would be if Italy were toaccept the proposals and Abyssinia, were to refuse.It was suggested that on the previous evening theCabinet, in taking their decision, had. not intended that the procedure at Geneva should be altered ifAbyssinia refused .   It was also suggested that if either of the parties refused we were legallyentitled to assume that the proposals would be dropped.    On the other hand, it was thought that if italy were to accept and Abyssinia were to refuse
it was certain that Prance would not agree to any newsanctions or to be implicated if new sanctions resultedin military consequences.    In that event,in accordancewith the Cabinet decisions, this country also wouldnot be willing to involve itself in any new sanctionsliable to provoke extreme action by Italy.   There wasa danger, therefore, that a position might be reached in which Italy would be continuing the war, no newsanctions would be imposed, possibly the existingsanctions would not be continued, and the sanctionsfront would have broken.The Cabinet were reminded that sanctions could onlyappropriatebe brought to an end by they body of the League ofNations at Geneva, and that until that body actedat any rate the present sanctions could not be removed.Another suggestion was that the existing sanctionsmight be given up in return for an armistice.   Therewas, however, a risk that if Italy accepted and abyssinia refused, some countries might refuse tocontinue the existing sanctions.    They would thencome to an end and the political situation in thiscountry might become difficult.It was pointed out, however, that the proposals nowunder consideration were the lowest terms which theFrench Government and the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs thought that Italy might agree to.They were the best terms, from the Abyssinian pointof view, that could be obtained from Italy.    If thoseby usterms had been rejectedy France would not have goneon with sanctions .The Secretary of State for Air at this pointreported that he had seen an Officer who had taken part in the initial Air discussions.   These could hardly have been more unsatisfactory .   The French
oould take no effective preparatory action beforemobilisation, which involved a political decision and decrees.   Even if action was sanctioned they were quite unready on the Italian frontier.    They wouldnot even send air squadrons to North Africa unless we sent the equivalent to Prance.   The French reore-sentatives also insisted that if hostilities broke out they must be confined to the Mediterranean area.,There must be no attack from Frenoh^torritory^   Theymight be willing, however, to render some assistanceto Malta from North African territory.    It, was clear,however, that they intended, that the whole brunt ofany hostilities should fall on the British, and thatno reliance could be placed, upon them.At the request of the Cabinet Mr Maurice Petersonmade a short statement in reply to certain questions.We thought, that the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs had been pleased at M. Laval&apos;s reception ofhis proposal for joint Staff discussions, though hewas, of course, unaware that those discussions wouldmake what appeared to have been an inauspicious start.The Secretary of State had been satisfied, with M,Laval&apos;spromise that France would fulfil her engagements, but-felt a doubt, which was not at all dispelled by M.Laval&apos;aattitude, as to whether M. Laval could carry french public opinion with him.   This uncertainty as to theFrench atiitude had perhaps been a factor in the diacus-sion of the French proposals for a settlement. It waspossible that the French might have been induced tooffer terms that were less favourable to Italy, but.in that event the French could not have guaranteedthat they had a reasonable prospect of success .The French had seemed rather confident regardingthe present proposals, which gave the impression that they might have taken &quot;soundings&quot; in Italy.
As to the proposals themselves, Mr Peterson said thatthey filled out the original proposals of theCommittee of Five rather in Italy&apos;s favour.   Theywere rather more favourable to Italy than he himselfquite liked.   For example, the cession of territorythat Abyssinia was asked to make in the North, andthe extension of the area of commercial development in the South,    The Southern part of Abyssinia was,he understood, sparsely inhabited, and by subjectraces - not Abyssinians.    There were some districts,however, which were economically flourishing and contained a fairly large population.   He could notestimate how much the Italians would obtain outof the economic exploitation of this territory apartfrom settlement.   The territory lay rather low andwas unsuitable for colonisation by North Europeanraces, though the Italians might find it lessunsuitable.In reply to a question as to whether there had been any discussion of whether the settlement now proposed would be a deterrent to a future aggressor,Mr Peterson said that M, Laval had claimed that asettlement on these lines would go a long way towardsbetter conditions in Europe by establishing Franco-British relations on a firm footing.   He agreed, withthe suggestion from a- member of the Cabinet thatM. Laval had also had in mind the importance of bringing the Italians back to the Stresa front.To this it could, be added that the territorialexchange was a reasonable one, and. that the economicpart of the proposed settlement could be justified on other grounds, e.g., the small population of thearea for economic development,    the fact thatAbyssinia, had. done practically nothing to developit&quot;    and that Vis Majesty&apos;s Government stood pledged
to give some recognition to Italy&apos;s economic claims in Abyssinia.In reply to a question the Minister for League ofNations Affairs reported that several nations had been approached on the subject of co-operation in the eventof a violent reaction by Italy to the oil sanction.The Turks had given a satisfactory reply, but the conversations with Yugo-Slavia were still continuing.It was thought probable that several nations would reply to gether .The Cabinet were reminded once more of the firmfront that had been presented by the States Membersof the British Coim.norw ealth in the whole of thisepisode, and some apprehensions were expressed lest the present policy might lead to dissensions.A suggestion was made that the political difficulties-ties which were likely to confront the Cabinet inthis issue all arose from the fact that Abyssinia was likely to reject the proposals, and it was suggestedthat even at this late hour it might be worth while to try and induce the French to allow the proposals to be sent to Abyssinia before they went to Italy.The Cabinet were reminded, however, that althoughthe Press reports were not entirely accurate anddiffered somewhat in substance, both Abyssinia andItaly must have a pretty good idea of the contents ofthe proposals .   We had always said that the three parties concerned must agree, namely,  Italy, Abyssiniaand the League of Nations:    and the only thing to bedone was to let all three know as near as possible at the same time.^he Minister for League of Nations Affairs asked if he was to support the proposal at Geneva, and thePrime Minister agreed that this -would have to bedone and that there might have to be some plainspeaking about the military situation.
Towards the end of the Meeting a number of detailed proposals were made and adopted for the amendment ofthe draft telegram submitted by the Minister for league of Nations Affairs in Appendix II.   the telegram as finally adopted appears in Appendix III.Discussion also took place as to the reply to begiven to the Private Notice Question by the leader of the Labour Opposition Party, referred to earlier in the Meeting.    The result of this discussion isgiven in Conclusion (b) below.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Minister for League ofNations Affairs should at once send to Sir Robert Vansittart (at Paris)the telegram set forth in Appendix III:(b) That the reply to the Private notice question by Wv Attlee should be asfollows :-The House is aware that the Committeeof Co-ordination at Geneva has approved negotiations by the Frenchand United Kingdom Governments inan attempt to find a basis for thesettlement of the Italo-abyssinian dispute *   Such a basis would., ofcourse, have to be subrnitted forthe vievs of the parties .    TheForeign Secretary, in passing through Paris, had conversations on this subject on Saturday andSunday with M, Laval, and certain proposals, both as to substance and procedure, were discussed betweenthem.   No suggested, basis has atpresent been submitted for the viewsof either Italy or Abyssinia and itwould clearly be premature to make astaiement on the subject at present.NOTF for supplementary:-Question:    When will be the firsto ppo r t uni t y fo r a s t a. t e me nt ?Answer:       The League is involved inall this.    If the matterproceeds to the point whenthe appropriate committee at Geneva authorisespublication of any proposals,these would then become thesubject of general discussion.The House must remember that france and ourselves areacting in this matter withthe approval of the League.
(o) That, in reply to Press enquiries,the Minister for League of nations affair should arrange for them tobe informed that no proposals had yet been submitted either to Italyor Abyssinia, but that the detailsof the procedure to be adopted werebeing discussed with the French Govern-me nt f(d) That if a request were made for a parliamentary Debate, the PrimeMinister should endeavour to arrange that it should not take place beforeTuesday, December 17th.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.7.1,December 10, 1935.
APPENDIX I.Decypher.Sir G. Clerk (Paris).December 10th 1935.December 10th 1935.R.4.30 a.m.December 10th 1935.No.257.By Telephone.MOST IMMEDIATE.Following from Sir R. Vansittart for Mr. Eden:-After our last telephone conversation I saw MonsieurLaval again about 2.0 a.m.      He asked me to define his attitude as follows.    He had not desired to send proposed message toAddis Ababa because he had reason to believe that a refusalwas certe in9 with a view to bringing petrol sanction into play.Neverthelesss since His Majesty&apos;s Government wished to sendit? he was willing to do so and he regarded this as a con-siderable advance on his part towards British point of view $but it was on distinct understanding that if anticipatedrefusal materialised there would be no question of imposing-petrol sanction.      I told him that I had already made quite-clear his position in the matter.    He said that the point which he wished to emphasise was this.     He could not besatisfied with an understanding of fresh consultation in viewof a new situation which would have arisen.      He wanted an engagement between two governments that if a proposal already accepted by His Majesty&apos;a Government and French Governmentwere refused then fresh sanction should not be brought into play;    for in such circumstances he would find it quite impossible to get such a measure accepted by his colleaguesor the country and he did not wish to find himself embroiled
with His Majesty&apos;s Government or any other of hiscolleagues at Geneva., though he seemed convinced that none of them would, in such a hypothesis3 proceed with additionalpressure.      In this I should have thought he was almost certainly right.      Prom this he showed no signs whatever ofbudging although at an earlier hour I had done my utmost -for a time with some hope of success - to persuade him thatthe position sufficiently covered an engagement to consultand to taking no precipitate decision on a new situation whichwould obviously in fact have come about.      It will be necessaryto take account of this attitude in any decision which may bereached this morning.      All the foregoing is of course onassumption that Italy accepts while Abyssinia refuses.Monsieur Laval has not attempted to discuss an eventualityin which both parties might refuse.My own opinion is that unless there can be agreement on this point we shall find ourselves tomorrow faced with animpasse which might either entail a breakdown or at best along and damaging delay.      I further feel that there will be almost universal support in this country for Monsieur Laval&apos;scontention and probably in other countries at present dis-quieted by the prospect of concrete action for which we arenow rightly pressing in certain eventualities.      I shouldhave thought general opinion would be that it would (? grp.omtd..) possible to apply stick to a country which had acceptedthe proposals.
appendix II.Following for Sir R. Vansittnrt.The Cabinet have considerecl your telegram T7o.-  257.In their view it is not possible to submit proposed basisof discussion for a settlement to one party to the disputealone.      Moreover,  the fact that the terms of the proposedbasis have beer-, given wide though inaccurate publicity in the French press, and subsequently here, emphasises theneed for the Emperor to receive equal treatment by being given,full and correct information as near as may beat the same time as the Italian Government.      To submitterms for settlement to the aggressor and withhold them from the victim of aggression seems to us indefensible.Therefore early and complete communication of text toEmperor cannot in the judgment of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentreasonably be regarded as a concession to their point ofview.-As to our attitude to the oil sanction, it isquite clear that the negotiations in connection with thebasis for settlement now proposed must take some considerable^time.      There would therefore seem to be no question of theimposition of an oil sanction in the immediate future,except in the contingency of Italy refusing,.It is to be expected that the replies of the two parties to the terms put before them must in any eventcreate a new situation which His Majesty&apos;s Governmentand the French Government together with the other Membersof the League will have to consider.
In addition, before an oil sanction could, be imposed it is probable that the Committee of Eighteenwould third? it necessary to examine the relation ofUnited. States supplies of oil to those of other membersof the Leagtie..      For all these reasons an oil sanctionin the immediate future seems unlikely to materialise.On the other hand,  it is not possible for his majesty&apos;s Government to give the undertaking for whichII.  Laval asks thafif anticipated, refusal  (by Abyssinia)materialises there would be no question of imposingpetrol sanction1&apos;.      Such an undertaking is clearly one for the League as a whole,  and attitude of His Ha jester&apos;sGovernment in such circumstances would have to dependon a number of factors which cannot he calculated until we know the nature of the replies..
APPENDIX IIIFollowing for Sir E. Vansittart.The Cabinet have considered your telegram No. 257.In their view it  Is not possible to submit proposed basis ofdiscussion for a settlement to one party to the dispute alone.Moreover.,  the fact that the terms of the proposed basis have beengiven wide though inaccurate publicity in the French press  andsubsequently here emphasises the need for the Emperor to receiveequal treatment by being given full and correct information asnear as may be at the same time as the Italian Government0      Tosubmit terms for settlement to the agressor and withhold them from the victim of aggression seems to us Indefensible.      Thereforeearly and complete communication of proposals to the Emperormust be an essential condition of their communication to Italyor of their presentation to the Committee of the League withour supportoAdjournment at Geneva would in our judgment depend onthe fact that  the communication had been made to both parties.It is not possible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to givethe undertaking for which H. Laval asks that should Abyssiniarefuse the proposals there would be no question of enforcing the petrol sanction,.      Such an undertaking is clearly one forthe League as a whole and  the attitude of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the circumstances will have to depend on a numberof factors which cannot be calculated until wc know the natureof the replies.It is by no means certain that the  answers will besimple affirmatives or negatives!    differences may well arise as to whether one or other answer is to be  regarded as anacceptance or rejection,.      It is to be expected that  the replies
of the two parties to the terms put before them must in any event create a new situation which His Majesty&apos;s Governmentand the French Government  together with the other Members ofthe League will have to consider.In addition before an oil sanction could be imposedit is probable that  the Committee of Eighteen would think itnecessary to examine the relation of non-member States&apos;  suppliesof oil to those of members of the League0      For all these reasons an oil sanction in the immediate future seems very unlikely to materialise except in the contingency of Italy-refusing the proposals6If Italy accepts and Abyssinia refuses the proposedbasis of settlement His Majesty&apos;s Government would neitherpropose nor support the imposition of further sanctions atonce nor before it is clear that no chance remains of settlement by agreement.,But they could not pledge themselves to oppose furthersanctions for all time or in new conditions which cannot nowbe foreseen.,
