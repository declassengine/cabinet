DISPUTE between^ALY and abyssinia.fBTHIOPIA) .H f previous ousF-&quot; Reference:Cabinet 40II   (35)    Con-H  elusion 4.)ft ft. .1. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet of the latest developments inthe situation in the Italo-Abyssinian dispute.Since the Meeting of the Cabinet referred to inthe margin he had. concentrated, his efforts oninducing France to realise the gravity of theposition.   Be had seen the French Ambassador afew days ago, when the latter had suggested thatat the forthcoming Meeting, the Council of theLeague of Nations should not extend its discussionsoutside of the Conciliation Committee.   TheSecretary of State had deliberately adopted a somewhat, negative attitude towards this proposal and. had pointed out that it would be useless to do nothing except to start further discussions by theConciliation Committee of Four, as that wouldconvey the impression that the Council wasdisinteresting itself in the question to theadvantage of Italy.   He believed, that his remarkshad been passed, on to Paris.   A few days later hehad seen the French Ambassador again and. had.suggested, firstly, that if a fifth Arbitrator were appointed, that would be a new factor in thesituation bu.t not a sufficient one:    and. secondly,that it might be well for a request to emerge fromthe Council of the League that the -three Powerssignatories of the Treaty of 1906 should dealwith the question urgently and, if possible, onbases to be laid down by the Council itself.    TheCouncil might then arrange to keep in touch, withthe proceedings, or even to remain in session.This would, give a. double procedure:    first, tostrengthen the Conciliation Committee, and, second,the three-Power talks, watched by the Council,
That, proposal had been passed on. to Paris, and helearned that M. Laval liked it . in factthere were signs of its coming back in the form of a french proposal&apos;    The Minister for League of nations affair had seen M. Laval and had discussed with him the very weighty Despatch which had been sent to HisMaiesty&apos;s Ambassador in Paris, and had reportedthat M. Laval liked our proposals, though he thoughtit might be difficult to get Signor Mussolini toaccept them.   He felt    therefore, that an advancehad been made, in so much as the French Governmentwas now fully alive to the dangers of letting mattersdrift, a*nd he thought they could be relied upon toput all pressure on Italy,    In reply to a question as to ho^ he envisaged, the relation between thethree-Power Meeting and the Council, he explainedthat his proposal would bring the Council up againstrealities.    He was most anxious to secure precisionin the three-Power discussions.   His idea was that theCouncil should either adjourn for a week or two, orkeep in being to watch the three-Power talks.    Ifthe Council did not formulate the general lines onwhich the three-Power talks should take place, hewould not, for that, reason, desist from working forthese discussions.    In reply to another question,he thought it doubtful whether the Abyssinian delegatewould wish, to open the large question, notwithstanding the sinister turn of recent events, if he saw a prospect of progress being made along the lines suggested, above. . If, .however, the Abyssinian delegateshould, press for a dis cuss ion from, a wider point ofview the Council would have to consider the matter.Much depended, on how far it was found possible tobring precision into the three-Power talks,

While Chorley was general!;/ accepted as asuitable site for the main factory, the advantages of South Wales, from the point of view of unemploy-ment, were pressed.    Emphasis was laid on the psychol-ogioal importance of giving some help to isolatedspecial areas, the populations of which it was difficult to move to other centres, and which were liable to become embittered by the fact that they felt themselves boycotted because their record wasa bad one.    The advantages from the point of view ofindustrial expansion of having more than one estab-lishment were admitted, but this was said to increasethe cost rather seriously.    Incidentally in thediscussion the question was raised, of the desirabilityof dealing with the floods especially in the entrances to the valleys, which are a bar to development inSouth Wales.
The question was also raised of the socialeffect of the removal on Woolwich, the centre of agreat co-operative movement and of extensive housingschemes .After considerable discuss ion the cabinet agreed  (a) mo accept the following recommendation by the Committee of Imperial Defence,viz . :-&quot;fa) To approve in principle therecommendations of the report f th e C omm it t e e on th e r em ova 1of the Royal Ordnance Factoriesforwarded with the Memorandum, bythe Seeretarv of State for War(6.I.D.

The Minister for League of Nations affairs reported that at Geneva the French representatives had acted markedly in line with.the British,   ^hisapplied especially to M. leger.Tt was noted that this development was inconformity with the wishes o&quot;1&quot;&apos; the Cabinet (Cabinet 40(55), Conclusion 1).Ministers were informed that the probable courseof events next week would be Anglo-French Conversationsfor a day or two   after which the tripartite discus-sions would, begin.Tn the course of the discussion reference was madeto an interim Memorandum by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee on the military implications of the appli-cation of Article XVI of the Covenant of the Leagueof Nat ions  (C.0 .S e-388) which had been sent to theMinisters present pending the working out of details,which was still in progress .The attitude to be adopted, by the Minister for league of Nations Affairs at the forthcoming Meetings.and. certain other matters arising consecuentiallv,v,ere discussed     and Conclusions were reached whichmay be summarised, as follows:-(a.) That the Minister for League of nations affair should do his utmost to maintainthe close relations already established with the French Government on the Italo-    -Abyssinian d1spute:(b) That, in the preliminary conversations with the French Government, his aim shouldbe to establish a programme for laterdis cuss ion with th e Ital ian repres representative ive.Tbis programme would, orobablv have to bedrawn in such manner as to bring, home tothe Italian representative that theultimate choice before Italy lay betweenth e foilowing alt international ives:-(i) Acceptance from Abyssinia of certain concessions  on points in the Italiancase which His Majesty&apos;s G-overnmenthave already told the British;:. Ambassador in Pome (who did not haveoccasion to use them.) that they couldsupport, if the case was made out, viz.:-
4 n n146&quot;(l)  in so far as threats to,  or violations of, the Italian frontiers are concerned:(2)  in respect of aggressions s-nch as Walwalaffray if proved against. Abyssinia tobpr satisfaction and that of the Leagueof Nations:(?)  in respect of breaches - if proven - of treaties between italy  and Abyssinia1.Further(4) in a. general way His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould be willing to support&quot; Italy in pressing Abyssinia to permit to italians and other foreigners the usual and reason-able facilities for trade, habitation etc.with regard to which she has beenobstructive in the past:(5) as regards slavery His Majesty&apos;? Govern-ment could support, insistence on Abyss iniaputting into force such future measures asthe league may think necessary and. remedyingpast failures to carry out her obligations in this matter.&quot;(Telegram to Rome Ho.555. of July Igjth.)It was foreseen, however, that there was no prospect of so limited a programme sufficingto bring Italy to an accommodation.    Tieindications were that the French Governmentwould propose to   apply joint suasion at addis ababa with, a view to extracting a maximum offerfrom Abvssinia.    It was also pointed out thatthe more attractive the offer to be induced the better would be the orosoects of the firstcourse and the less the prospect of having toconsider the alternative course below,   possibly the French Government might have other additions to suggest, and. the Minister for League ofNations Affairs might, at his discretion, remindthem that they had never made any concession to Italy comparable with the British cession of Jubaland.ORf n) Vhe carrying out by the League of Nations ofthe procedure laid down in the Covenant,including,  in the last, resort,  considerationby the members of the League of their obliga-tions thereunder.In any reference to this latter aspect the Ministerfor League of Nations Affairs should be guided, bythe approval given by the Cabinet to the lines suggested, by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs on Wednesday, - July 24th, where he indi-cated that in discussions with the French&quot;The underlying assumption would bethat both Powers realised, their obligations and were jointlyinterested to find a way out of-the difficulty&quot;.
Ann14 (The Minister for League of Nations affairs would, of course, &quot;be on his guard againstgiving the French Government any&quot; opportunity-nity to suggest to Italy that we were pressing them to commit themselves tosanctions.    Any detailed&apos; discussion of sanctions should be avoided, as this does not arise at present and,  if itarises at all, belongs rather to discus-s ions at a later&apos;stage .(c) That the Minister for League of Nations Affairswho would be accompanied by the Permanent UnderSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs inParis, should, as far as possib1e, keep intouch with the Prime Minister, who would, bein France at the time of the Meetings, andin particular should arrange to report theposition verbally to him after the conclusionof the Meetings, in order that he might decide whether, and when, to summon a Meeting of theCabinet.    It appeared probable to the ministers present that if the Paris Meetings did. not produce a satisfactory result, a Meeting ofthe Cabinet would be required before the endof August, when important decisions might benecessary.Lake Tsana .(d) That if the three-Power Conference shouldn o t a eh i ev e a s a *&quot; is fa c t o ry result, th equestion of Lake Tsana would become important,and. the Minister for League of Nations affairs should have discretion to warn the Italianrepresentative that this was an importantBritish interest.   He might repeat the warning given by Sir Edward Grey (afterwardsEarl Grey of Fallodon) in 1915:(e) That in the meantime the Foreign Office-should examine the question of Lake Tsanain its political and. technical aspects, and consult the Defence Departments on any aspectsof the au es t ion whi ch might cone er n them:Defence Aspects.(f) That the Secretary to the C-cabinet and Committeeof Imperial Defence should, inform the Chiefsof Staff Sub-Committee that the Prime minister would, be glad if they would consider thefollowing questions:-(1) At once to examine the question ofwhat the position would be if Italytook the bit between her teeth:(S) On the assumption that- the contingencyreferred to in (l) might take place,are there any steps that ought to betaken at once to provide against it?In this latter connection the Secretaryof state for Foreign Affairs said that theForeign Office would have no objection to
any relatively quiet steps being,taken, such as,  for example, the raising of the anti-aircraft,defences of Malta to the approvedscale.    They would not even objectif the movement of anti-aircraft guns became public .Whitehall Gardens. S.W.1August  6,  1935.

The Meeting was held for the purpose of a preliminary discussion of the latest phase of the Italo-Ethiopiandispute5    the intention being to clear the ground to someextent in order to expedite the business at the cabinet of the following day.THE MINISTER FOR LEAGUE OF NATIONS AFFAIRS have hiscolleagu.es an account of the proceedings at the Three-PowerConversations in Paris.      The order of events had been asfollows .-15th August.Tnis day had been devoted to informalpreparatory conversationsi    M. Laval and Mr. Edenhad seen Signor Aloisi separately.      SignorAloisi had put forward as a basis for discussion the suggestion that the United Kingdom andFrance should give some public recognition ofItaly&apos;s need for expansion, and should recognisealso that Italy had a special position, botheconomic and political, in Abyssinia.      SignorAloisi had made it clear that economic concessions in Abyssinia would be of no value to Italy unlessthose concessions had the backing of an Italianmilitary garrison.In return for these declarations SignorAloisi had offered an assurance of Italianco-operation at Geneva.Mr. Eden had made it clear that the abovesuggestions (which amounted practically to giving Italy a Class C Mandate) of:&apos;: ered no hopeof a solution.16th August.plrst regular session of the Conference,Mr. Eden had made it clear that this country
would not endorse an Italian military and economicoccupation of Abyssinia.M. Laval had produced certain Quai d&apos;Orsaydrafts, which Signor Alois! had. declined to accept.The British arid French experts had then been invited to work out a new draft.      Before this&quot;drafthad taken shape M. Laval had sent a Message to theFrench Bmbassy in Rome, instructing them to warnSignor Mussolini that our forthcoming offer v;ouldrepresent the limit of concession open to us.The Conference had resumed as soon as the experts&apos;draft had taken concrete formj    this had been thedraft of which the substance had appeared in the newspapers..      After displaying much unwillingness,Signor Aloisi had. been induced to send it to Rome.His main objections to the draft had been that it made no provision for any special Italian economicand military position in Abyssinia^    on the contrary,it reserved British and French rights in Abyssinia,and laid stress on the independence and integrity ofthat country.17th August.No re-ply was received from Italy and no meetingtook place.18th August.Signor Aloisi had separate interviews withthe United Kin.gd.om and French Delegates.      He had communicated the Italian reply to both.      Its substancewas that the Anglo-French proposal was unacceptable to Italy, from every point of view.      To Italy,Abyssinia represented a menace to he destroyed,whereas the Anglo-French view was axjparently thatAbyssinia should be given increased authority and placed on an equality with the three powers now in
Conference.     G-ignor Mussolini reserved, his right tomake a statement of his case at Geneva.In re-ply to an enquiry whether he had any alternative suggestions to put forward, Signor Aloisihad told Mr. hden that the Italian view remainedexactly as it had been developed to him (Mr. Eden)+earlier in the year.A hreak had now keen recognised to he inevitable and the Communique which had appeared in the press had been drawn up.19th August.The Conference being over, Gignor Aloisi andMr. Eden had taken their farewells of M. Laval, whohad convened it.      No particular meaning need beattached to the fact that Sirnor Aloisi had not askedfor a further talk with Mr. Eden that day - they hadparted on friendly terms the previous evening.Mr. Dden&apos;s talk with M. Laval had made it clearthat the latter had not yet fully thought out the implications of the Meeting on September 4th.      He had .said, however, that Prance did not want to turn herback on the United Kingdom and what it stood for    hebegged, nevertheless, that the British Government would realise prance&apos;s oVifficulties.* The Minister for League of Nations Affairs reminded his colleagues that the Italian -proposal, as GignorMussolini had developed it in the Spring of the presentyear, had been that Italy should, acquire the sovereignty over a circular area including about two-thirds of thepopulation of Abyssinia - in fact over all Abyssiniaexcept a central plateau.      Over this plateau Italy wishedfor a Protectorate.These were Gignor Mussolini&apos;s proposals for apeacefully negotiated settlement.      On the other hand,he had said that if it came to a war he would wipeAbyssinia off the map.
THE- SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS regarded the harmonious Anglo-French front which had been maintainedup to the present time as an unexpectedly good factor.It had been understood in Paris that the Italians had putevery sort of pressure on Mo Laval to come down on their side;    they had been giving it out in Paris that theBritish Empire was in a state of decline,  especially fromthe military point of view.      It was significant that M.Laval had not listened to them.      It was not, of course,possible to judge how long the present united fxjont would hold.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL enquired whetherMo   Laval had given any indication of his probable attitudeat Geneva on September 4th.THE MINISTER FOR LEAGUE OF NATIONS AFFAIRS saidthat he himself had received no indication.      Sir robert vansittart, however, had obtained the impression fro:m histalks with Me Leger that France would be prepared to take part in economic sanctions.Incidentally Sir Robert had obtained very definiteimpressions of the extent of the Italian propaganda inParis.      The Italians had been going about speaking of abyssinia as the first stage in their African conquests;of seizing domination in the Mediterranean from Britishhands, and in general of renewing the glories of the RomanEmpire.THE PRIME MINISTER enquired whether Sir samuel hoare has any information regarding Germany&apos;s intentions.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat the Prime Minister&apos;s question raised the whole problemof how far the non-Member States would participate in economic sanctions.      The non-Member States which it wasnecessary to consider were the United States, Germany,Japan and Brazil.
His view v/as that these States might conceivably be induced to take part in economic sanctions.    the chances of their doing so were, he thought,  improved bythe latest investigations of the Foreign Office,which haddisclosed the possibility of applying economic sanctionsin two separate stages.    While there could be no hope ofnon-member States participating in a second and merestringent stage,  there v/as no reason why they should not participate in a first stage - i.e.  in sanctions involvingno belligerent   action. .      Such measures might be negative,not positive.    For example, the States participating mightsimply refuse to accept imports from Italy.    If thegreater part of the world went even as far as that theeffect on Italy might be considerable.In particular,he had been in touch with theUnited States Charge&quot; d&apos;Affaires0      The latter&apos;s Governmentwere taking the Abyssinian question very seriously, andtheir participation in the first stage of economic sanctions did not appear inconceivable.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL enquire whether Sir Samuel Hoare had had in mind that the step of refusing to export to Italy might be reserved for thesecond stage.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS was inclined to think that this might be wise.    Obviouslysuch a sanction would be vastly more effective than a refusal to admit imports.The Secretary of State went on to say that theMinister for League of Nations Affairs and himself,  after considering the position at home and abroad, were clear in advising their colleagues that it was nothing less thanessential to follow the regular League of Nationsprocedure in this crisis.      The Council Meeting onSeptember 4th was the necessary first step.     Events atthis Meeting might take several turns;    one possibility
could be so,having regard to such phrases as &quot;shall ipsofacto be deemed to have committed an act of war against all other Members of the League, whic^h hereby undertakeimmediately to subject it to the severance of all trade erfinancial relations&quot;.+For Article 16 of the Covenant see appendix to the present Minutes.was that they might develop in the following stages.First Stage       Report on the Three Power conversations in Paris - if possible a Joint Reportby Mr. Eden and M. Laval.Second Stage.    Italian Statement (probably lengthy)  oftheir case and Abyssinian answer.Third Stage.      Consideration of the two cases by theLeague of Nations Council (possiblyassisted by a Sub-Committee)  andpronouncementoThe fact must be faced that at any time during these processes the news might arrive that war had begun.The following matters would then at once be added to those already under consideration:(a) Whether Article 16* of the Covenant   had beenviolated, and if so by whom.(b) What economic and military action could or should be taken.(c) In the event of economic sanctions being-found desirable,  the question whether all member States were prepared to co-operate.(d) The further question of what non-member states were prepared to co-operate.(e) The question whether the non co-operationof certain States was likely te makeeconomic sanctions of no account.At this stage in the Meeting the question was raised (in particular by the Chancellor of the Exchequer andthe Home Secretary) whether Sir Samuel Hoare&apos;s suggestionthat economic sanctions might be divisible into two or morestages,of increasing stringency,was consonant with theactual terms of Article 16 (see Appendix).It was prima facie difficult to agree that this
THE MIElSTEE FOR LEAGUE OE NATIONS AFFAIRS saidthat the answer to these doubts was to be found in theResolutions    regarding the interpretation of Article 16which the League of Nations Assembly adopted in 1921.Certain of these Resolutions were intended to becomeamendments to Article 16^    as such they had never comeinto force since the requisite number of States had notratified..      Others of the 1921 Resolutions were specificallyadopted by the Assembly as aids to the application of theArticle.      The precise legal position of these latterResolutions was somewhat uncertain but on the whole therewas no reason to doubt that they could be treated asrules for guidance recommended to the Council and to theMembers of the League.      It was in the light of certain specific Resolutions;, among those just referred to thatthe Foreign Office experts had advised that the applicationof economic sanctions by stages was legitimate.A further material consideration was that at the timewhen the League Covenant had been framed the expectationhad been that membership of the League would be universal.At present this was far from being the case and theywere entitled to interpret Article 16 in the light ofthat fact.THE HOME SECRETARY was inclined to agree,to a certain extent.      He was not yet satisfied;, however  that therewere not certain steps such as &quot;the severance of all trade or financial relations&quot; which were of automaticapplication and in no way dependent on the &quot;stages&quot; ofeconomic sanctions which the Council might recommend.s   The more important of these Resolutions will be foundreproduced in Appendix V to CP. 169(35).
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS , turningto the conversations with the leaders of non-Government    -parties which had taken place,  said that he had been left with the impression that there would be a v/ave ofpublic opinion against the Government if it  : irepudiated   its obligations under Article 16 - that wasto say,its obligations under the principle of collective responsibility, on the assumption that France would goas far as we were prepared to do.      It wasabundantly clear that the only safe line for His Majesty&apos;Government was to try out the regular League of Nationsprocedure.Of course,if France found it impossible to proceedto extreme measures., there could be no question of&quot;putting her in the dock&quot;.      On the other hand,it would for usbe desirable/to make a statement at some stage in the september proceec!ingss  to the effect that if all other member States were ready to carry out their obligations,we also were ready.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that he recognised to the full the advantages of proceeding by stages in the matter of economic sanctions.      It mustbe admitted;, however,  that a piece-meal procedure wouldbe correspondingly slow in producing effects and he wouldnot be surprised if, in the meantime,  the Italiansmanaged to pull off a great initial success.      It mightbe difficult to commend the piece-meal procedure to public opinion in the countries co-operating in the sanctions.
THE HOME SECRETARY raised the question whether it was desirable to make any pronounoement on behalf of HisMajesty&apos;s Government during the interval before 4th September.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS thought itbetter to refrain from any public statement.At this stage Sir William Malkin andMr.  Strang entered the Meeting7-THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS  informed sir William Malkin and Mr. Strang of the difficulty which Ministers present had found in reconciling Article 16with the piece-meal method of applying economic sanctionswhich appeared to be contemplated by the 19S1 ResolutionsSIR WILLIAM MALKIN thought that the actual terms ofcertain of the interpretative Resolutions were very helpful in this connection.Resolution No.l.  read   as follows:-&quot;The resolutions and the proposals foramendments to Article 16 which have beenadopted by the Assembly shall,so long asthe amendments have not been put in forcein the form required by the Covenantsconstitute rules for guidance which theAssembly recommends as a provisional measure9to the Council and to the Members of theLeague in connection with the applicationof Article 16.ifResolution No.4.  contained the wordss-&quot;It is the duty of each Member of theLeague to decide for itself whether a breach of the Covenant has been committed .....  11
Resolution Nov..6.   read as follows:-&quot;If the Council is of opinion that aState has &quot;been guilty of a breach of the Covenants  the Minutes ofthe meeting at which that opinion is arrived at shall be immediatelysent to all Members of the League,accompanied by a statement of reasons and by an invitation totake action accordingly.      Thefullest publicity shall be givento this decision.&quot;Article 9 provided for the possibility,for varioussufficient reasons,of certain States remaining loyalto the principle of economic pressure but not themselvesco-operating in its exercise.Article 14 was very relevant.      It read as followss-&quot;In cases of prolonged application ofeconomic pressure, measures of increasingstringency may be taken.      The cutting -off of the food supplies of the civilpopulation of the defaulting state shall be regarded as an extremely drasticmeasure, which shall only be applied ifthe other measures available are clearlyinadequate.&quot;THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS thoughtit niight now be accepted that the sweeping phrases ofArticle 169  such as &quot;the severance of all trade or financial relations&quot; were to be interpretated in thelight of the &quot;glosses&quot;of 1921.      For example, he thoughtit would be legitimate to refuse to receive Italianimports while continuing to export to Italy.SIR WILLIAM MALKIN agreed that this would becase,if the Council of the League had recommendedparticular sanction. In such an event the Membewho followed the Council&apos;s advice    would have satthethatr Statesisf ied
their obligations under Article 16.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL recalled thefact that the situation of 19249 in which an attempt hadbeen made to close   a   gap in the Covenant3  had beenthe result of the deliberations of 1921.THE HOME SECRETARY wondered whether it was possibleto get round the following words in Article 16s-&quot;it shall ipso facto be deemed tohave committed an act of war against all other Members of the League&quot;.SIR WILLI.AM MALEIN said that this point was met bythe third of the Resolutions adopted as rules for guidance.      It read as followss-&quot;The unilateral action of the defaultingState cannot create a state of war;it merely entitles the other Membersof the League to resort to acts of war or to declare themselves in a state ofWar with the covenant-breaking State?but it is in accordance with thespirit of the Covenant that the Leagueof Nations should, attempt9  at leastat the outset3  to avoid war,  andto restore peace by economic pressure.&quot;THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER wondered whether any other country was in the position in which we foundourselves9  that we had supplied Italy with coal to thevalue of  5009000 and not yet obtained payment and ifa break occurred, would presumably never do so.It was suggested that a similar position might possibly obtain with regard to oil imports into italy from Rumania.THE HOME SECRETARY enquired whether the Foreign office had considered   a    situation in which Signor Mussolinimight decide that a waiting game suited his interests?andin which he would accordingly not strike until after the close of the September deliberations at Geneva.-11-
THE SECRETARY OF&apos; STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said thatas he read the situation,Italy would probably go to warwithin two or three weeks of September 4th.In reply to a question, SIR WILLIAM MALKIN said thatthe function of the League Council in the matter of a breach of the Covenant was only to give an Opinionf    each member of the League had then to decide the question for itself.THE HOME SECRETARY pointed out that in practice theStates represented on the Council would already be publicly committed by their votes on the opinion referredto *The Committee were informed that the Members of theCouncil at the present time were Argentina, Australia,Chile, Czecho-Slovakia , Denmark, France, Great Britain,Mexico, Portugal, Poland, Russia, Spain and Turkey.SIR WILLIAM MALKIN called attention to one of theproposed amendments to Article 16 adopted in 1921, which included the following words.-&quot;In deliberations on this question in theCouncil, the votes of Members of the Leaguealleged to have resorted to war and. ofMembers against whom such action was directed shall not be counted&quot;.The fact that this amendment remained unratifiedmight be taken as meaning that the adverse vote of theoffending State would prevent the Council from recordingan opinion.      The contrary, however, was arguable.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said thatit was now clear that each Member State must take its own decision.      States were not in the position inwhich they must all simultaneously sever trading-relations etc.SIR WILLIAM MAI-KIN pointed out that in practicesanctions would be ineffective unless they were concerted
and. that the best place for concerting them would appearto be at a meeting of the League Council.THE LORD PRESIDENT OP THE COUNCIL was still not clear that the opinion of the League Council was not to acertain extent an operative opinion.      He thought it wouldbe difficult to get over the words -hereby undertakeimmediately to subject&apos;&quot; in Article 16.THE HOME SECRETARY pointed out that this was cleared up by the Eighth of the Resolutions adopted for guidance.This read &quot;The Council shall recommend the date on whichthe enforcement of economic pressure, under Article 16,is to be begun, and shall give notice of that date to allthe Members of the League&quot;.In reply to a question, TEE SECRETARY OP STATE FORFOREIGN AFFAIRS agreed that our attitude on the piecemealapplication of economic sanctionsmust be fundamentallyaffected by the view taken by the non-Member States.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER thought that we might find ourselves in considerable difficulties even if theUnited States and Japan, for example, were induced to prohibit trade with Italy.      The possibility would still remain that the activities of German shipping mightrender the sanction meaninglessj    in such a situation weshould have to be very careful if we were not to landourselves in war with both Germany and Italy.THE MINISTER FOR LEAGUE OF NATIONS AFFAIRS hoped thatin practice economic sanctions would not be begun until a Committee of the League Council had carefully worked out the methods of their application - that is, until ithad ascertained definitely what attitude the non-member states were going to adopt.THE SECRETARY 0rn STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said thatsuch an investigation by experts might very probably lead
to a decision not to impose economic sanctions.THE PRIME MINISTER enquired whether the Presidentcould hind the United States in the matter of economic sanctions.THE CHAHCE1-L0E OP THE EXCHEQUER was uncertain of the answer.      If it were found, however, that the Presidentcould not do so the situation would he much simplified.As he (the Chancellor of the Exchequer)  saw thesituation it could he summed up in the following statement*-(1)    Even the mildest economic sanction might in theend lead to war.(2)    If this were true, steps ought to he taken toput our armed forces into a state of readiness.THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGN AFFAIRS agreed.Signor Mussolini in his present frame of mind, was not a normal man, and it was conceivable that some apparently-innocuous action on our part, eg.  in connection with theMediterranean or with Lake Tsana, might be taken as acasus belli.THE MINISTER FOR LEAGUE OF NATIONS AFFAIRS thought  it   -even possible that Signor Mussolini might so regard aBritish decision to raise the embargo on the export of arms to Abyssinia.THE HOME SECRETARY called attention to the fact that australia was a Member of the League Council at the presenttime.THE SECRETARY 0r;i STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said thatat his meeting with the Dominion High Commissioners that day Mr. Bruce had said that in his opinion the League Councilmust make a bona fide investigation into the question ofeconomic sanctionsj but that the result of the investigationwould be that economic sanctions would be found useless forthe present purpose.
SIR WILLIAM MALKIN said that what had been contemplated in 1921 was that the League Council would have the assistanceof a Technical Committee in its investigation.Till LORD PRESIDENT 0&quot;&apos; THE COUNCIL was clear that it was out of the question for the British Government to make any statement to the effect that Article 16 could not operate in the present crisis, before the Council Meeting onSeptember 4th.TEE SECRETARY OP STATE EON FOREIGN AEEAIRS thought thatwe should have to arree a form of words very carefully with france before we said that the machinery of economic sanctions would not work;      The Trench might agree that itwould not work in the present crisis, but the;/ would nevertheless want to keep it intact    for use against Germany.It was imperative to discover M. Laval&apos;s intentionswithin the next 14 days.THE PRIME MINISTER called attention to M. LavalJsgenuine difficulties.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that if the finaldecision was against economic sanctions we should have tobe most careful not to say &quot;we were prepared to use thembut France was not&quot;.      The formula   would have to be something to the effect that we and France had come jointlyto the conclusion that they would not work.THE HOME SECRETARY called attention to certain provisions of the Kellogg Pact,      The steps to be taken under that Pact, if one signatory were to break it by using war as a instrument of policy, were not dissimilarfrom the first stage of economic sanctions as proposed bySir Samuel Hoare,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS agreed.
THE LORD ri^LLpENT OF THE COUNCIL saidthat,if Italy proceeded to extremes,it wouldhe a great shock to British public opinion if no outward action were taken by H.F. Government.He had been encouraged by the present discussion to hope that it would be possible to discovera completely -pacific method of applying economic sanctions against Italian trade.He realised that it remained to beconsidered whether legislation (and thus theearly summoning of parliament) would be necessary  in that case.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER enquiredwhat view the Foreign Secretary took of sir austen Chamberlain&apos;s suggestion that there shouldbe a meeting of the signatories of the KelloggPact.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOB FOREIGN affairs thought that this might be a very useful card toplay at a later date.      It would be a mistake toplay it at present and thus to sidetrack theLeague of Nations.      To do so now might disturbFrance and offend Italy unnecessarily.
mhargojIPC       &quot;firms,ixportTHE SECRETARY OE STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS thoughtthat the British embargo would be definitely unfair toAbyssinia if it were continued longer.      It would benecessary, of course, to lift the embargo as regardsItaly also.      He had been glad to find that Mr. Lansburyshared this view.THE HOME SECRETARY agreed.ifpieet. THE HOME SECRETARY called attention to the factthat,once Italy had started war against Abyssinia, she would be entitled under international law to &quot;visit and search&quot; British ships for contraband - a deplorablesituation.      This would be quite apart from any questionof blockade.SIR WILLIAM MALKIN agreed.      No question of blockade could arise as regards Abyssinia,which was aland-locked State.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat the present position as regards the BritishMediterranean Fleet was that the Admiralty considered it very undesirable that it should remain at Malta.      Tomove it to Gibraltar would be in the nature of a retreat,and the present plan was accordingly that it should move to Egyptian waters on August 29th.      It might then bebased on Alexandria and Haifa.The Admiralty were considering the desirabilityof making this move earlier than August 29th,There remained also for decision the questionof the Home Fleet.These were naturally matters for decision bythe Cabinet.      His colleagues might be interested toknow that Sir Herbert Samuel had suggested that theMediterranean Fleet should be strengthened.
THE LORD PRESIDENT OP THE COUNCIL thought it important that Italy should he given no excuse for sayingthat the British Fleet had gone to the Suez Canal.talti- THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said(Aircraft and searchlightsiGuns for that ahout 8 anti-aircraft guns/still remained to he sent toIMalta,Malta,  of those which it had teen already decided to despatch.      The reason was that the 900 men required to work  the guns were Reservists and that their calling up mightoccasion alarm. This was a matter which would haveto he decided hy the Cabinet.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.22nd August, 1935.
