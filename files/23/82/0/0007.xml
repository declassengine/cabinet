InisHJTE betweenittaly andIabyssinta!(ETHIOPIA) .[general.(pj*eyi previous reference:Cabinet 38(35), Con-clusion 1.)1. In accordance with the Conclusion mentionedin the margin, the Cabinet held a Special Meetingmainly to consider the dispute between Italy and abyssinia, and had before them a number of documents.On the general question the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs had circulated a Memorandum bythe Minister for league of   Nations Affairs on theprobable procedure at Geneva when the Italo-Abyssinlandispute comes before the Council towards the end ofthe month (C.P.-151 (35)).The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that when he asked for thepresent Meeting he had thought it certain that, theMeeting of the Council of the league of Nations wouldtake place on Thursdav or Fridav next.   Now it seemedprobably that the Meeting would be postponed for afew days.    At first Signer Mussolini had appearedfavourable to a meeting of the signatories of theTreat;/ of 1906 and had implied that Italy would, berepresented at Geneva.   More recently, however, theItalian Foreign Office showed signs of opposition to either a meeting of the parties to the 1906 ,,T!reatyor of Italian representation at Geneva.    He himself,however, had made clear in his instructions to theBritish Ambassador at Rome that he saw no prospectof the possibility of postponing the Meeting of theCouncil or of confining it to the mere question asto who was the original aggressor at Wal-Wal.At present the possibility of a meeting under the 1906Treaty still held the field.   If, however, it was clear that nothing was coming out of it, he was aversefrom our being drawn into a blind alley, more hestudied the question the more strongly he felt thatthe only card in our hands was the deterrent, bywhich he meant publicity and conversations with the
French in order to get them to put pressure on Italy&apos;before the Geneva discuss ions.There was general agreement that it was mostimportant to Induce M. Laval to take the questionmore seriously than he had done hitherto, with aview to very strong joint pressure being put uponItaly.Among the proposals discussed at the meeting were the foilowing(i) That the Minister for League of nations affair should see m. Laval, either onhis way to Geneva or at Geneva, andshould be authorised to inform him, in :the privacy of negotiation but not in public, that the British Government wereprepared in the last resort to fulfil .their engagements under the Covenant andwould eventually have to announce thatthis had been their attitude.While it was suggested that this course would be consistent with the presenttrend of development ofpublic opinion in this country (though not necessarilylater on if it led to war), the comment was made thatit would probably leak out at once and cause greatirritation to Italy, and that in any event M* Lavalwould be under a strong temptation to inform Italyand obtain the credit for having blocked our proposalfor sanctions-.   This course, it was suggested, wasnot likely to be successful in stopping Italy from making war on Abyssinia, because it was extremely unlikely that France would co-operate in sanctions .Even if France should be willing to co-operate,however   and. there were signs that French publicopinion in this matter was rather in advance ofM, Laval   it might lead to war between the
United Kingdom and France on one Bide and Italy onthe other .   Wars were easier to start than to stop,and. it was difficult to foresee how far such a9&apos;situation might lead in Fur ope today.   What, it was asked, would he the reaction on Yugo-Slavia towardsItaly, on Germany towards Austria, and what theeffect of the inevitable bankruptcy of Italy?In fact, the question of sanctions had to be weighedin the light of its effect on the whole Europeans itnation .(ii) A second suggestion was that the Ministerfor League of Nations Affairs should intimate to M. Laval that in his personal view (citing Sir Austen Chamberlain&apos;sspeech) the British Government would be compelled to announce its willingness to fulfil its obligations under the Covenant,or at any rate that, if no action were taken, they would have to state thatthey had been willing but that other nations had been unwilling.mhe comment, was made, however, that a Ministerengaged in conducting official negotiations abroadcould hardly be instructed, or expected, merely toexpress personal opinions.(iii) A third suggestion was that in so much -as France, as a neighbour of Italy, wouldbe more affected by the possibility ofhostilities with that country than anyone else, we should be justified in pressingM. Laval to state first what was his attitude in the event of a default by italy.
(iv) A fourth proposal was that there shouldhe a Conference with the French Government,the object of which should be to make a survey of the reaction that an italo-- Abyssinian war would, have on Europe, andto bring home to M. Laval the consequenceson France in particular of a breakdown ofthe provisions of the Covenant and its possible reactions on other mutual security arrangements.    If this ooxurse were adopted the aim would be, not so much for eithercountry to press the other as to its attitude on. sanctions, but to examine the question from an Anglo-French point of view, in orderto discover what steps could be taken to avert the serious consequences of an outbreakof war.The Cabinet were informed, however, that it would, bedifficult to propose a new Conference while the 1906Conference was still under consideration.(v) A fifth suggestion, which had arisen out ofthe enquiries, by the Advisory Committee ofthe Committee of Imperial Defence on trade questions in Time of War, namely,^Miat whilecollective sanctions could not be appliedeffectively without the exercise of belligerent rights, a financial sanctioncould, be applied (in fact was alreadybeginning to apply itself automatically)by merely refusing credits to Italy.   Itwould only be necessary to remain passiveand to refuse any credit or loan.
A difficulty in this proposal was that it did not operate soon enough to deter war.(vi) A sixth suggestion was that the Secretaryof state for Foreign Affairs should prepare a Despatch to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador inParis setting forth not only the inter-national aspects of the question, and moreparticularly their vital interest to France,but also the probable reaction of an Italo-Abyssinian war on the natives throughoutAfrica -r a matter which equally concerned the British Empire and France as greatAfrican Powers .   The Ambassador would, befurther instructed, on receipt of theDespatch, to take tip these questions, withM. Laval and so to prepare the way forconversations by the Minister for Leagueof Nations Affairs on his way to, or at,Or eneva *At the request of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs the Cabinet agreed _mo adjourn a decision until Wednesday next,&quot;July 24th, in- order to give theSecretary&quot; of State time further toconsider&apos;the matter and to formulatefresh proposals in the light of thediscuss! on and more particularly thelast-named proposal to send a despatch to Paris .
$pUTE betweenIP andIyssiniaIIhiopia).ply of Armsyibyssinia.fgviousference:cabinet 38 (35)$elusion 1).2.    The Cabinet had before them the following documents dealing with certain subsidiary matters:in connection with the dispute between Italy and abyssinia, namely:A Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs (CP. 147 .(35))dealing with the transit of consignments of arms to Abyssinia through Britishcontiguous territory;    the granting of licences for the export of arms;applications from private persons for permission to take service with the abyssinian forces;    the use of retiredBritish Army Officers as PoliceInstructors in Abyssinia;    requests fromAbyssinia for help from the British red cross Society;    the protection of Britishsubjects in Abyssinia:A Memorandum by the Secretary of State-for Foreign Affairs (CP.  138 (35))explaining the position under the Treatysigned in Paris on August 21, 1930,between the United Kingdom, France,  Italyand Ethiopia:A Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies (CP.  146 (35)) statingthat a decision was required as towhether any large consignments of armsdestined for Abyssinia should be permitted to be transported throughBritish Somaliland.The Cabinet were informed that the Treaty of1930 bound us to allow the transit of arms throughBritish territory unless the attitude or disturbedcondition of Ethiopia constituted a threat to peace or public order.In connection with the proposal ef theGovernor of Somaliland that in the interests of the protectorate escorts would have to he provided (atthe consigner&apos;s expense) from the military or police forces available in Somaliland, the Cabinet were reminded that this was only part of the normal dutyof the Government and would be applied without question if,  for example, a caravan of gold were inquestion.      Only recently the Royal Air Force at Aden
had been used to ensure the peaceful transit of acaravan in the hinterland.      The Italians would have no justification.for protesting against a precaution ofthis Kind.On the other hand, the Cabinet were assured thatto provide escorts in this way would create much ill-feeling in Italy.On the question of export the Cabinet were informed that we had no obligation under the 1930 treaty to grant licences though in the view of the ForeignOffice it would be in accord with the spirit of theTreaty not to withhold licences.On the other hand, the Cabinet were reminded that France, Germany, Belgium and Czechoslovakia had given Italy assurances that henceforth exports of arms from these countries destined for Ethiopia would be prohibited.      If licences were given for the exportof British arms it would be said in Italy that the casulties of the Italian army had been inflicted byBritish weapons and ammunition.While no arms or munitions had been exported to Ethiopia from the United Kingdom since September1934, some very small consignments had oeen sent toItaly.    Both countries had obtained petrol fromBritish sources.      Italy had become largely dependentfor water on condensers supplied from Great Britainand was drawing large supplies of various kinds fromBritish East African Colonies.      Abyssinia had receiveda number of motor lorries.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat whatever decision was adopted, he had promised to inform Italy, and he also proposed to informthe French Government and to try to obtain common action. Whatever decision vrere taken, both parties ought to be treated alike.        On his
To postpone the question until their meeting on Wednesday,July 24th.-8-suggestion, the Cabinet agreed;

IlNDlA.Suggested usebf Tear Gastor Dispersingliiobs.(previous reference:-Cabinet 4S^C^)I Conclusion^li).4.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer raised as amatter of urgency the question of whether tear gascould not be used for dispersing mobs and dealingwith riots in India.The Secretary of State for India said that themain objection to the use of tear gas in that kind of case^ was the danger of creating a panic among largecommunal crowds.      Hitherto it had only been usedto smoke out armed criminals &quot;brought to payin a house or place of refuge.The Cabinet were informed, however,  that theGovernor of Bombay had been asked a few months agoto initiate an inquiry into the use of tear gas andthat the matter was still under consideration.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.7T.1.-,22nd July,  1935.
