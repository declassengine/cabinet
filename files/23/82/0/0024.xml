THE ITALO-abyssinian dispute.suggestion to amend theI opposition motion.(previous reference:.Cabinet 55 (35)Conclusion 3).1.     At the outset of the meeting the cabinet discussed the drafting of a suitable amendment to be put forward in reply to the Opposition motion in the House of Commons.      It was felt, however,that it would be premature to attempt to draft it until later in the day when further information from Geneva and elsewhere would be available.The Cabinet agreed:That the Prime Minister, the Chancellorof the Exchequer, the Home secretary and the Parliamentary Secretary tothe Treasury should meet later in theday to consider the drafting of an amendment.-1-

THIS ATLANTICAIR ROUTE.(previous reference:I&amp;binet 51 (35)Conclusion 5).FA4.    The Secretary of State for Air reported thatas the result of the Cabinet decision referred toin the margin, representatives of the United Kingdomand of the Dominions had co-operated effectively in negotiations with the Government of the UnitedStates of America at Washington on the subject ofthe Atlantic Air Route.      He had not yet obtainedfull details, but he could report that they had arrived at a reasonably good agreement.      He wasnot quite sure whether the reciprocity had been asgood as he had hoped, but he thought the positionso far as the Atlantic Air Route was concerned was satisfactory.      He had exercised caution in refusinge.g.concessions/at Hong Kong until he had receivedfurther details.
INTERNET TONALLABOUR ORGAN-ISA&quot;&quot; TON.Proposal? fora Porty-T-TourIfeek.(previous reference:Cabinet SO(3*),  Con-clusion 8.)5.    The Cabinet had. before the,- a Memorandum bythe Minister of Labour (C.P.-239 (35)) on the subjec4of the proceedings of the International Labour Organ-isation in relation to the proposals for a Forty-HourWorking Week.    Questionnaires had. been received, from geneva relating to public works undertaken orsubsidised by Governments&apos;    building and civil engineering;    iron and steel wo^ks &apos; an-1 coal mining.The primary question relating to each field ofindustry was in the following form:&quot;Do you consider it desirable that theInternational Labour Conference should,adopt, in the form of a. Draft Convention,int er nat io na 1 re gul a tions f o r t hereduction of hours of work in accordancewith the principle laid down in theForty-Hour Week Convention, 1935?&quot;The short answer to the above question, in the view^ the Minister o&quot; Labour, should, be in the negative.Special points arose in regard to public worksundertaken or subsidised by Governments, and coalmining.    As to the former the Minister suggestedthat it would be wrong, to legislate in the matter of hours not on the basis of the nature of an activity,but according to whether or not the activity was directly or indirectly being conducted under Govern-ment auspices.    With respect to the latter theMinister did not propose to reply to the questionnaireat present, but attached to his Memorandum a draft.reply to the 40-hour week proposals in relation to building and Civil Engineering, and. Iron and SteelWorks, for the.approval of his colleagues.The Cabinet agreed:To approve the policy proposed by theMinister of Labour set forth in CP. 239 (35),as well as his proposed draft reply to theForty-Hour Week proposals in relation to building and civil engineering and ironand steel works.
internationallabour organ-isa^ ton .&quot;Holidaysv? ith Pay&quot; .(previous reference erene e:Cabinet 31(35), Con-clusion 5.)6,    The Cabinet had before the..:- a Memorandum bythe Minister of Labour (CP.-240 (35)) relating to proposals before the International Labour organisation on the subject of Holidays with Pay.    He thought itwould be impossible, for reasons set  forth in hisMe ;o rand urn, to support a proposal for a DraftConvention which would indicate the possibility oflegislation     Nevertheless it appeared undesirable toadopt a purely negative attitude towards the extensionof holidays with pay.   He therefore suggested, thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government should support a proposalfor a Recoinmendat ion which would not imply an obligation to pass legislation, and. attached forthe consideration of his colleagues a draft replyto be sent to the International Labour Organisation.The Minister of Labour reported that he now wished to make an addition to the draft reply(see below).The Minister of Labour, in connection withthe various matters that had to be considered as mentioned in paragraph 7 of CP. 240 (35), undertook to examine and bear in mind the question of standards of efficiency.The Cabinet agreed:To approve the following draft reply(in which the new words are underlined)to be sent to the International LabourOrganisation:His Majesty&apos;s Government are ofopinion that holidays with pay should beprovided wherever circumstances permit.They feel, however, that apart from other difficulties attendant upon an attemptto deal with this matteriby means iofinternational regulations the considera-tion   which has so far been given to theproblem has not taken into account thegreat problem presented by the largeproportion of workpeople who during theyear work for different employers or whoare not continuously employed.      It does
not appear, therefore, that it would be possible to adopt international regu-lations in the form of a Draft Convention.His Majesty&apos;s Government, however, wouldbe prepared to support the adoption of a recommendation which would have the objectof encouraging all practicable steps to betaxcen to extend the provision of holidays with pay and of stimulatingfurther consideration of this subject.
roVTiRNMHN&quot; 7.    The Cabinet had before them a Memo rand um byrjILDlNGS  IK ,    uJjjjrp^LL. the First Commissioner of works &apos; CP.-229 (35)) inform-ing them of developments that had. taken place in the(previous reference: matter of the proposed new Government Buildings infiabiriet 51, Con- Whitehall, and. asking approval to proceed forthwithelusion 9 .)with the preparation of working drawings and otherpreliminaries an&apos;&quot; to make such provision as might berequire&apos;&apos; to meet the cost of the acquisition of the site and of building operations in the Estimates forthe ensuing financial year.Plans, designs and models of the proposed new buildings were exhibited in a corner of the cabinet room.The First Commissioner of works supplementedverbally the information contained in his Memorandum.A number of difficulties had had to be surmounted.The first had been to get agreement to the site;then to get the architect&apos;s plans adopted.      Thefirst proposal for a &quot;spinal&quot; plan had been rejected by the Fine Arts Commission.      Then the architecthad been thrown back on a plan for three internalcourts.      His original design had been altered very considerably, and the present design reflected anagreement reached between the architect and the FineArts Commission.      The London County Council had approved the scheme in principle.     Their BuildingCommittee had approved the elevation, layoutand design, and probably the formal approval of theCouncil would soon be received.      The Westminster city council had also approved.      The Air Ministry&apos;s lease ingingsway expired at the end of 1939.      Consequently,a beginning ought to be made with the demolition of thenorth end of Whitehall Gardens early in 1936 in order
that the buildings to accommodate the Air Ministryat that end might he completed by the date proposed.The Minister recalled that there had been represen-tations by the Civil Service that some of thearrangements weve very bad especially in privatehouses that had been converted into offices.The Air Ministry, who now only had 85 square feetfor each member of the clerical staff, would in thenew building, have 97 square feet compared with theAdmiralty&apos;s 98 square feet which was the best in theCivil Service.     He added that he was encounteringincreasing difficulty in obtaining accommodation for .official purposes anywhere within the Whitehall area.The case, therefore, for developing the new site wasvery strong.      The matter of finance was one for theChancellor of the Exchequer. &apos;Some criticisms were made of the designs.The Chancellor of the Exchequer regretted that he had not yet had time to deal with thefinancial aspects of the question.The Cabinet agreed:To approve the proposals of the first commissioner of Works as set forth in cp.  229 (55), subject to leaving tothe Chancellor of the Exchequer thefinancial aspects of the matter.
