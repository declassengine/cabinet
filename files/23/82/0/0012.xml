&quot;The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed.the Cabinet that M. Lavalls idea cp sanctions wasthat they should, be in two stages :-Stage I:      A refusal to sell war material and perhaps certain &quot;key11minerals .Stage IT:    To refuse Italian goods.The Cabinet were informed that neither stage wouldinvolve legislation, provided that action was taken under the Treaties of Pe?ce Act, and that the Councilof the League of Hat-ions had taken the necessaryres olutions .Considerable discussion took place as to therelative advantages of imposing the strongest availableeconomic sanctions from the outset, such as bothstages of v. Lav-alls proposals,  or of beginning with very light sanctions and increasing them if theyshould prove ineffective.The Cabinet were informed that the result of the inquiry by the Advisory Committee on Trade questions in -ime of War was.to show thft P, Laval&apos;s Stage I  llCCL,a refusal to sell, munitions to Italy   would haveeffect, and the stoppage of nickel would be verydifficult to organise.    Stage II was easier to organise,was likely to be acceptable to the nations principally concerned  &apos;who &quot;ere themselves competitors with italy in the manufacture of such commodities as artificial silk) and would make it more difficult for Italy topurchase commodities abroad owing to lack.of credits.In favour of imposing the largest economic sanctions on which agreement could be reached,  it waspointed out that Italy had already shown a good, dealof nervousness and anxiety as to these sanctions.Faced with very great difficulties,  including the steady diminution of the gold reserve and foreign
credits, the prospect of the emulative effect ofthe sanctions was bound to exercise a great psyeholog-ical effect on the country.It was suggested that, if the ultimate object was merely to save the face of the league of Nations and.eventually to let. Italy down lightly, small sanctions would suffice&apos;    but that if the aim was to strengthen the league and to prove its efficacy it would bedesirable to aim at the larger economic sanctions.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Gabi.net that he was doubtful whetherthe French would agree to Imrgo/sanctlbha.    He was convinced that M. Laval was not willing to carry than to the point of a blockade, and would never consent to military sanctions.   Military sanctions, therefore,were not worth considering.    He suggested that emaileconomic sanctions would be of some value-owing tothe weak economic state of Italy.    It was sa-et- p-ffi^iU^improbable- that fairly soon Italy would find herself in great difficulties and be prepared to accept some kind of settlement.    At that point he hoped that thePowers would not be too intransigeant and would be willing to consider a settlement which, withoutdestroying Abyssinian independence, would give Italysome satisfaction.    On the question of sanctions hethought we should aim at an embargo on munitions and war material and ingredients of their manufacture,as well, as a refusal of Italian exports ;    but other nations had to be convinced, and we might have toa c c ept 1es s .In the course of the discussion stress was laid on.the importance of the opportunity afforded by theReport to give the public all the facts, includingthe position of slavery in Abyssinia, on which thegeneral public was ill-informed.
Towards the end of this discussion the Ministerfor League of Hat ions affairs inferred the Cabinetthat the representatives of the other rations atGeneva were roost reluctant to speak at all.   we would continue his efforts to induce their to do so.    In the meanwhile he hoped that his colleagues,       in makingspeeches in this country, would continue to hammeron the theme that the Italo-.Abyssi.nian dispute wasnot a British concern but a League of Nations affairand that the whole future of the League depended uponhow the question was handled.Be also said he was strongly impressed by the unit and cordial support he had received at Geneva fromthe Dominions.   Representatives of all the Dominions,including a representative of Mr de Valera, regularlyattended the Meetings of the Commonwealth DelegationsThe Cabinet agreed - (a) That the influence of the Minister for league of Nations Affairs at Geneva,should be used to secure that theCouncil&apos;? Report on the Ita1o-abyssinian dispute should contain a fair statementof the case without any concealment ofthe facts, but should not close the door to the possibility of territorialadjustments in the eventual settlement:p \   fb) That military sanctions were out of thequestion, in view of the attitude ofthe French Government:(c) That in the matter of economic andfinancial sanctions the Government&apos;?policy should be to advocate at Genevathe imposition of the maximum ofeconomic - sanctions on which, agreement could be secured.    It was recognised,however, that the amount, of the sanctions would depend.&quot; on the attitude of other nations, not only the States Members ofthe League, but also of non-Members,and on what might prove practicable asthe result of international invest investigation-t ion:(d.) That the Board of Trade should send an expert to join the United kingdom delegation at Geneva in order to advise the Minister for League of Nations affairs on economic sanctions:
( e) That the Advisory Committee on trade questions in ^ime of War should, assoon as possible,  complete and presenta Beport on the forms of economic andfinancial sanctions applicable to thepresexit erisis:(f) That British Ministers, in their speeches,should continue to make clear that the Italo-Abyssinian Dispute was not aBritish concern but a League of Nationsmatter, and that the future of the Leaguedepended on its handling of this question.
yg ATLANTIC-p&apos; ROUTE.2. The Cabinet had before them the followingdocimnents on the subject of the Atlantic Air Route:-deviousp-Terence:&apos;cabinet 42j?5)   Oon-conclusion 7.)by the SeeretarvAir To .P.-164&apos;&quot; (35)1ofA Memo rand, urnStale for seeking his colleagues.es agreement to the following main principles(l) That the subsidy necessary forthe operation of the Trans-Atlantic Route shall be provided:(2) That negotiations with the IrishFree State Government for theestablishment of a base in that territory should be pressed,forward.:(s) That financial assistance, in a form to be decided later, towardsthe provision of a base in theIrish Free State should be given.A further memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Air &apos; CP.-182 (35))drawing attention to the Report of the?-; Imperial Committee on the ibrans-Atlantic Air Service, which, sat duringthe Ottawa Conference, and in particular the recommendation that the governments should, agree that in the development of trans-Atlantic air routes they wouldgive every possible preference to the route United Kingdom, Irish Free State,Newfoundland and Canada:A Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal(C.P.-184 ( g5))  expressing his disagree-in ent with the particular stepsrecommended by the Secretary of Statefor Air in (2) and (3) above,, and giving reasons why a base In&apos;NorthernIreland, should be preferred.Considerable discussion took place on theproposal that the base should be established inthe Irish Free State, and the Lord privy Sealdeveloped at some length the arguments in his memorandum.It was suggested that before a final decision was taken the whole situation should be discussed with and explained to the prime Minister ofNorthern Ireland, and that the advantages of thealternative of a base in       Northern ireland should be explored.
.7hile there was general agreement on thedesirability of the establishment of an AtlanticAir Route,  the Cabinet agreed:(a) That the Prime Minister,  theSecretary of State for Air andother Ministers should see thePrime Minister of Northern Irelandand discuss with him the questionof the site of the proposed base at an early date.(b) That in the meanwhile the Cabinet&apos;decision should be reserved.

The Cabinet had before then:- an Interim Peportby the committee  on the Organisation of the CoalMining Industry (C .P.-160 (35;)):, setting forth thefollowing points of principle on which cabinet decisions were required before they were in a positionto give detailed, consideration to the questions raisedby the Reports of the Inter-Departmental Committee(CP.-139 (54)  and CP.-77 (35)):-(l) Is the Government prepared to foster  not necessarily by compulsion  a policy of concentration in spiteof the probable effect on numbers employed?(3) If so, is the Government prepared to approve the unification of Royaltiesin principle as its contribution tothis policy?In this event it is suggested thatthe Corrrndttee should be authorised toprepare a detailed, scheme, draft aB ill and open negotiations withrepresentatives of the Royalty Owners.(3) Is the proposal of the Secretary for mines that a Royal Commission beappointed to consider and report on matters of Health and Safety in theMining Industry approved?(4) May the Committee be authorised toconsider the relation of the Coneettdecision to the royalties problem whendrafting a Royalties Bill?The Cabinet agreed that the question should appear immediately after &quot;Foreign Affairs51on the Agenda for their next regular weekly meeting.
rntrT5 HAWING-       5.    The Cabinet, had before them a Memorandum by the------ - * ^ork? fC .P.-3 78 f 55;)&apos;) informingfirst Commissioner 0&quot;proposed Fn-largement of.them that an opportunity had. arisen for the acquisi-tion and preservation as an open space of the buildingsite, known as 14, 15 and 16, Great. George Street,adjoining the Canning enclosure, thus increasingextensively the amenities  of Parliament Square,Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament.   he considered, thet any such scheme should be regardedpri.miari.ly as a national rather than a local responsi-bility.     The Chancellor of the Exchequer had not found hims elf able to suggest any Exchequer contrlbu-tion, but the First Commissioner pronosed that- thenational contribution should be assessed at two-fifths of the total cost, the balance of t-three-fifths beingshared by the three Local Authorities concerned, viz.,the London County Council, the Fiddles ex County Counciland the Westminster City Council.After hearing a statement by the Chancellorof the Exchequer,  the Cabinet agreed:That the proposed improvement of the amenities of Parliament Square was not one of sufficient importance from anational point of view as to justify a departure from the ordinary practicethat the cost of improvements to citiesshould be paid for by Local Authorities.Consequently, the devotion of the tax-payers money to this purpose could notbe approved.
