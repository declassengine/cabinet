In view of the rumours of General Falkenhayn&apos;s visit toLarissa and the establishment of a wireless telegraph station at that place, the War Cabinet, who feel that they have aspecial responsibility in the matter, owing to their attitude on thesubject of General SarraLVs instructions, directed the Chief of theImperial General Staff to make full inquiries as to the militarysituation, and to what extent the Greek Government are carrying out their undertakings, a report being made to the War Cabinet at theearliest date.4. The War Cabinet decided that the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff should record, in the form of a special instruction toField-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, the importance which they attaeh.
to the utmost despatch in carrying out, both in the letter and in thespirit, the agreement made with General Nivelle on the 16th January,1917, in order that the British Expeditionary Force may be ableto carry out its share of the operations at the date laid down inthe aforesaid agreement, or even before that date, with the forces available at the moment, if the weather and other conditions makethe operations possible and advisable. It should be also noted thaton no account must the French have to wait for us owing to our arrangements not being complete, Further, it was to be borne inmind that, as the Germans might attack before we do, we, by making every effort to advance our arrangements, should beassisting to stultify any effort of theirs.Roumania.5.

Lord Derby reported the results of the Conferences on thisquestion between the Admiralty, the War Office, and the ShippingController, held as the result of the deliberations of the War Cabineton the 2nd January (War Cabinet 25, Minute 5). The followingmilitary considerations were urged in favour of the establishment ofa cross-Channel ierry : (1.) If would be a great advantage, in the middle of a bigoperation when anyT particular kind of shell was urgently required, for shipments to be run straightthrough from; the munition works in England to thefront,(2.) Owing to lack of repair shops in France, it would be an enormous help to get locomotives and rolling stock sentback for repairs in England, and returned on theirwheels in the ferry-boats to France.^3.) The repairing and shipment of &quot; Tanks &quot; would be greatlyexpedited, especially having regard to the lifting ofthese and other heavy weights.(4.) When the time comes for demobilisation, the ferry-boatswould be most useful: 1The President of the Board of Trade referred to theundertaking made by His Majesty&apos;s Government with Italy in regardto her agricultural trade, Which, it is hoped, will be diverted fromGermany to this country. He pointed out the undesirability of waiting until after the war to establish this trade. Italy looked to usto carry out our bargain, which; in his opinion, could only be done with the assistance of the ferry service, owing to the perishablenature of the goods in transit.
The Fourth Sea Lord reported that the Board of Admiralty,after full consideration, were in favour of the establishment of theferry service, provided : (1.) That this service in no way hampered the existing trans-port arrangements by having terminals at ports nowused for loading and unloading.(2.) That the construction of the ferry steamers in no wayinterfered with the construction of anti-submarine craft.(3.) That the ferry service did not run east of Dover on accountof the grave risk incurred from mines and submarines.The Admiralty considered that the best ports for terminalswould be in some place in the Solent (not Southampton) to someplace near Havre. The risk from mines and submarines would beless than to the east of Dover, and it was considered that the ferrywould not be able to run at night, if to the east of Dover, on.account of the necessary mine-sweeping. The Admiralty did notconsider Richborough was feasible, as that port was not suitable for;such large craft as the proposed ferry steamer.The Shipping Controller, whose views were understood to be;shared by the Director of Transports and the Shipping control committee, gave the following objections to the scheme :-(1.) Owing to mines and submarines, the original proposal to run from Richborough to  Gravelines or to Dunkirk,was, he  believed, no longer considered feasible.   It-would not be practicable, in his view, to rely on more&quot;than three or four trips a week from Southampton toHavre.(2.) If the scheme was working smoothly, it might be advantageous, but he doubted whether this would bethe case.(3.) The construction of these ferry-boats would displacethe construction of four large cargo steamers of8,000 dead-weight tons apiece.(4.) The cost of a food-ship was about 125,OO0Z., compared withthe cost of 200,000L for a ferry-boat.(5.) The food-ships could be used, if required, for transport toFrance or for ocean-going service, whereas the ferry-boats could not.He admitted that, if the service could be worked fromRichborough to Dunkirk, it would be open to less, objection thanthe alternative proposal to run from, the Solent to Havre.Having regard to the important military advantages offered by this proposal, the War Cabinet decided : To authorise the Admiralty to construct, without delay,three, and not four, ferry-boats, as the extra one would interfere with the merchant-shipping programme already-laid down. The experiment should be organised onthe assumption that the experimental service could be run, in the first instance, from Richborough. In view ofthe Fourth Sea Lord&apos;s statement that the selection ofRichborough was contrary to the views of the Admiralty,it was decided that terminals should be prepared in theSolent, as well as at Richborough. They further decidedthat these services should take priority for constructionimmediately after anti-submarine craft.Cross-Channel 9. Major-General Sir Eric Geddes reported serious delay in theTransport of transport of railway and other material for France.   He submittedRolling-stock. figures showing arrears amounting to 50,000 tons a week.    he pointed out that, unless more shipping could be obtained for this[1365-36] B 2

Stanley.purpose, the prospective arrangements made for the advance wouldbe seriously endangered. Certain shipping had;been, allocated, butnot enough, and Sir Eric Geddes therefore asked for an order of priority.The War Cabinet decided that It was desirable to give priority to the transport of this- material. The President of the Board of Trade was invited to examine, in concert with the interdepartmental committee on the restriction of Imports, what com-modities could be cut off in order to release space forthis material, and to report to the War Cabinet on thefollowing day.10. The War Cabinet decided that the Treasury should sanctionan expenditure of 500,OO0Z. required by the War Office for making certain preparations in regard to port repairs.11. The War Cabinet had before them a preliminary report(War Cabinet Paper G.-105) of Lord Curzon&apos;s Committee appointedto examine this question as the result of their deliberations on the21st December, 191b&apos; (War Cabinet, 13, Minute 12).In regard to the list of articles referred to in War Cabinet, 30,Minute 1, the President of the Board of Trade said that the matter could wait for action until after the report of the interdepartmental committee.D.
