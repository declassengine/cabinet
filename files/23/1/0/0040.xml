General StaffWeekly Summaries.Mesopotamia.The Balkans.,Western Front.Greece.3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported to tbe WarCabinet that the right bank of the River Tigris, in the region ofKut-el-Amara, had now been cleared of the enemy, and thatBagdad, where there is an ammunition factory, had been bombed.4. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that thereis no sign of the concentration of any further divisions on theMoldavian front.The War Cabinet note that the information at present available does not point to the probability of any immediate offensive on the salonica front.5. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that aGerman regiment had been taken away from the Balkan front andhad been located in Alsace, where the enemy had hitherto been somewhat weak. Five divisions are now concentrated on the Alsacefront, which might be connected with the recent rumours from switzerland. rIhere was, however, no confirmation of the manyrumours of a great concentration on the Western front, beyond aslight increase in the numl er of divisions, and in heavy artilleryin the Ghent district. At present, the greater part, of the enemy&apos;sdisposable reserve in the Fafctern theatre was engaged in Roumania.6. The War Cabinet had before them the reply* of the GeneralOfficer Commanding the British force at Salonica to the enquiriesmade by the Chief ol the Imperial General Staff as to the militarysituation in Macedonia, and the extent to which the GreekGovernment are carrying out their undertakings, called for as theresult of the Meeting held on the 17th January (War Cabinet, 36,Minute 3 . The gist of this telegram, which was supported byample details, is to the effect that the Greeks are carrying out their undertakings in the letter, but not in the spirit, and that the greek army is a potential danger in the rear of the Allied Army at salonica.This information does not correspond with that received fromthe British Minister at Athens, which is, on the whole, to the effectthat the Greek Government is loyally carrying out its engagements.The War Cabinet observe that the arrangements previouslydecided on Jor tbe control of the Greek movements have not yetcome into effect, and they believe that this may account for the unsatisfactory and conflicting state of our information. Theynote, however, that the action of the various officers sent out forpurposes of control has now been co-ordinated under the supremedirection of General Sarrail.   It was decided that : The Foreign Office should make communications to the FrenchGovernment, in order to make the respective relations ofthese officers perfectly clear, and that the Chief of theImperial General Staff should repeat the gist of these toGeneral Milne.* A copy of this telegram is kept in the office of the War Cabinet.2. The War Cabinet further decided that the weekly summariesof military events, prepared by the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff, should be circulated by the Secretary of State lor War to thesame persons as the summaries of external political affairs, andshould be returned to him when read.
USSeparation Salute.7. The War Cabinet arranged that the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs and the Chief of ihe Imperial General Staff should ascertain whether any of the officers sent out in connection with thecontrol had yet readied Larissa or other stations in Northern Greece,and, if not, direct that they should be given their orders and despatched immediately.The War Cabinet feel that if any obstruction is being placed by the Greek Government in the performance of their duties bythese officers, very grave decisions may have to be taken.8. The War Cabinet directed the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff to invite General Milne&apos;s opinion as to the last paragraph ofhis telegram, in which he states that General Sarrail considers that action should be taken immediately to safeguard his rear by theoccupation of Larissa and Volo, thus anticipating the Germans,and supplying himself with a new base and line of communications.9. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed theWar Cabinet that there was a difference of view between theBritish Minister at Athens and the French- Government as to thedate on which the salute to the flogs of the Allies, as one of thetermsthat :-of reparation, should be paid.   The War Cabinet decided in accordance with the French view, it was desirable that thisapology by the Greek Government should be made at as early a date as possible, and that no great importance attached to the fact that the representatives of the allies would return to the ships in the Pirasns after the ceremony.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should take thenecessary steps to give effect to this decision.The Arab Revolt.The Farsan Islands.10. The War Cabinet approved the action of the Admiralty in authorising the hauling down of the British flag on the FarsanIslands in accoidance with the instructions of the Foreign Office.Particulars of this transaction are given in Appendix II.The Shortage ofMerchant Shipping.The NumbersCarried by Trans-ports.Portugal.The forthcoming conference inRussia.11. The War Cabinet sanctioned a proposal of the Admiralty,which has been agreed to by the War Office, for the addition of20 per cent, to the number of troops carried by British transportsin the Mediterranean ; the Admiralty taking steps, if possible, toincrease the transports&apos; establishment of rafts and belts.12. The First Sea Lord reported that, in consequence of thereceipt of information to the effect that the Germans had knowledge that tne Portuguese Division was ready to sail, the Admiralty had found it necessary to postpone the departure of the force. he stated that, in view of the increased danger to the transportsarising from the fact that the Germans were aware of their intendeddeparture, and also as the division was urgently required in France,the Admiralty had made special arrangements for the despatch ofa force of destroyers to escort the transports. The destroyerswould sail at an early date.13. The War Cabinet authorised the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to inform the Russian Government that the BritishGovernment would have no objection to the presence at theConference of the British Ambassador in Petrograd.
Home Defence.The Number of divisions that canbe sent to Franceduring the nextfew Months.14. The War Cabinet had under consideration a memorandumby the General Staff, dated the T.)th January, 1917, on the questionof the number of divisions wnich can be sent to France during thenext few months.*It was clear to the War Cabinet that the decision on thisquestion depends largely upon the arrangements made for HomeDefence. Up to now the forces retained for Home Defence havebeen based upon the fohowing Conclusions of the late war committee, reached on the 23rd August last:  (a.) It is reasonable to say that at the present time the enemycannot attempt a serious invasion of this country because he cannot spare the necessary troops from tne Continent  at any rate, unless he abandons his efforts againstVerdun.(6.) Apparently he has stifficient sea transport for the con-veyance of 160,000 men, and as it is impossible to saynow that he will not be able to spare that number ofmen at some future date, we should prepare to meet them unless the Navy can undertake to prevent them from reaching our coast.(c.) No material reduction can be made in the number of troops now allotted to Home Defence other than such as maybe found feasible by substituting volunteers for permanent Home Service. The sedentary forces are largely composed of draft-finding units, and they must remain in the United Kingdom in any case, while theGeneral Service formations and mobile forces, inaddition to forming for the time being part of the HomeDefence forces, constitute a valuable, and in fact theonly, strategical reserve for use when and where requiredabroad.The War cabinet general Staff are ablenote that neither the Admiralty nor theto report any change in the premises onwhich the above decision was reached. The General Staff statethat the enemy might - still be able to find 160,000 men. TheAdmiralty state that the enemy can still find transports for a force of this size. The Admiralty further state that they can give no guarantee that the Fleet will, be able to prevent a forceof this size from reaching our shores. Though it would be embarrassed by submarines and small craft, the Admiralty,particularly having regard to recent developments in the GermanNavy in warfare by mines and submarines, cannot guarantee thatlanding operations will be interrupted by the Grand Fleet withinless than twenty-four to twenty-eight hours of the force being sightedoff the coast of the United Kingdom. Hence, neither Departmentcan undertake the responsibility for saying that invasion is impossible,and consequently 500,000 men, the force estimated as necessary bythe Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief Home Forces, is still lockedup at home for the purpose of dealing with attempted invasion, for the garrisons of defended ports, and for protection against hostile airci aft.Having discussed the matter with the First Sea Lord, the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff, and the Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief Home Forces (who gave a sketch of the military arrange-ments for coastal defence), the War Cabinet decided that: (.1.) On a review of all the risks to which this country is exposedduring the present War, the danger of invasion is notamong the greatest. They concur in the statement ofthe Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief Home forces that, in the necessity of taking risks somewhere, he, if he were a member of the War Cabinet, would send everyman abroad who was fit for service, as the least of the risks to be taken.* Copies of this are available in the office of the War Cabinet.
15. The War Cabinet arranged with the Field-Marshal Com-manding Home Defence to spare soldiers from Home Defence toassist in labour of national importance in case of emergency.The Secretary was directed to notify this decision to the civil departments concerned, in order that they might formulate theiremergency requirements from time to time for the consideration ofLord French.   The Departments concerned are : Ministry of Munitions,Admiralty,Board of Trade,Board of Agriculture and Fisheries,Minister of Labour,Port and Transit Executive Committee,Shipping Controller,His Majesty&apos;s Office of Works.16. The War Cabinet had under consideration a GeneralSummary * of the Naval Situation in regard to Shipbuilding andthe Submarine Menace, dated the 16th January, 1917, submitted tothem by the First Sea Lord, and decided that: The revised programme &quot; B &quot; should be carried out pending further consideration, and that twelve suitable merchant ships should be handed over by the Shipping controller to the Admiralty, and that the twelve mercantile &quot; Q &quot;ships, referred .to in programme &quot; B,&quot; should be allotted to the Shipping Controller by the Admiralty as soon asthey are built.17. The  War  Cabinet decided, as a matter of principle,that :-The Naval and Shipping questions must be examined on theassumption that the war will last through the year li&apos;18.In conformity with this decision, the War Cabinet directed that: (a.) The Admiralty should  review the  situation  on  thesepremises, and prepare a further report;* Copies of this highly secret document are retained for reference in the Officeof the War Cabinet.[1365-40] CMan-power.The Employmentof Home defence forces to Assist inCivil Occupations.The Naval Situa-tion.Shipbuilding andthe SubmarineMenace.Further Examina-tion of Naval and shipping Questions.(2.) Subject to the concurrence of the Secretary of State for theColonies (whose opinion would be invited on thefollowing day), they decided that pressure should be puton the Canadian Government to send abroad theadditional Canadian Division at present detained in thiscountry, owing to the difficulty anticipated in findingdrafts for its maintenance.(3.) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff should beauthorised to send two additional British Divisionsabroad, to be withdrawn from Home Defence.They take note that the effect of this latter decision will be toreduce the mobile force available for Home Defence from nineDivisions to seven, not including one Division in Ireland. It waspointed out by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, however,that this decision, though involving a reduction by only about one-fifth in number, was equivalent to a reduction of one-half, when thequality of the Divisions to be withdrawn and of those remainingwas taken into consideration.
(6.) The Shipping Controller should obtain data as to any-actual increase of output that had been effected in the shipyards of the United Kingdom by the adoption of asystem of payments by results ;(c) The Shipping Controller should have full authority toplace orders on behalf of the Government for the building of merchant vessels both in the Dominions and abroad,and his attention was especially called to the desirability of- sending an expert to Canada to enquire from the firmsthere as to what they could do ;(d.) The Minister of Munitions should be asked to enquireand report upon home resources in general, especially asto the possibilities of developing, during the next twoyears, the production of larger quantities of ore in theUnited Kingdom. He was also to be desired to report asto the amount of scrap metal0 that could be obtained by acollection, such as has been adopted by the CentralPowers, and utilized with a view to an eventual reductionof imports.Ferry-Boats for 18- The First Sea Lord asked the War Cabinet to approve,Cross-Channel with reference to War Cabinet 3H, Minute 8, paragraph 2, of theTransport Service.    Report of the Fourth Sea Lord, that &quot; anti-submarine craft &quot; shouldbe understood to include destroyers and submarines.The War  Cabinet concurred, and directed  that the words&quot; which includes destroyers and submarines,&quot; should be added at theend of Minute 8.(Initialled) D.
