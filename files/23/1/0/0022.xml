[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the use of the Cabinet,   January 1917.SECRET.[To be returned to the Secretary, 2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.]WAR CABINET, 22.Minutes of a Meeting of the War Cabinet held at 10, Downing Street, S.W., onFriday, December 29, 1916, at 12 noon.Present:The Prime Minister (in the Chair).The Right Hon. the Earl Curzon of   The Right Hon. A. Bonar Law, M.P,Kedleston, KG., G.C.S.I., G.C.I.E.The Right Hon. Yiscount Milner, G.C.B.,G.C.M.G.In attendance :The Right Hon. Sir E. Carson, K.C.,M.P., First Lord of the Admiralty.Admiral Sir J. R. Jellicoe, G.C.B., O.M.,G.C.V.O., First Sea Lord of the.Admiralty.Lieutenant-Colonel Sir M. P. A. Hankey, K.C.B., Secretary.Major C. L. Storr, Assistant Secretary.Captain Clement Jones, Assistant Secretary.1. THE War Cabinet discussed with Sir Rennell Rodd certain questions connected with the proposed conference with the Frenchand Italian Governments (see also paragraph 18 below).2. The Director of Military Operations stated that the enemy attack anticipated by the General Staff on the Moldavian front had actually commenced in the Oitoz Pass. The strategical object ofthe enemy appeared to be to cut off, or compel the retirement of, the russo--Roumanian Army covering Braila-Galatz.This information tends to confirm the view expressed to theWar Cabinet by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff that theimmediate effort of the enemy in the Balkans is in a northwarddirection rather than against the Allied Army based on Salonica.This seems to indicate the probability that two months must elapse before sufficient enemy troops can be withdrawn in order to make aserious attack on the Salonica front.The Right Hon. the Earl Derby, K.G.,G.C.V.O., C.B., Secretary of Statefor War.The proposed anglo-French-Italian Conference.The Balkans Enemy Action.Talona..   3. In reply to a question by the Prime Minister, the Director ofMilitary Operations gave it as his opinion that increased pressure on
the part of the Italians operating from Valona would, if they couldpenetrate the Albanian mountains, assist the Allies by seriouslymenacing the flank of the enemy should he attempt to advance intoGreece, but for this it was essential that the force operating fromValona should be able to move freely.General Maurice pointed out that the terrain in Albania pre-sented great difficulties to an advancing force, which would have tobe perfectly equipped in regard to transport, &amp;C-5 for mountainwarfare, and that it oifered to the enemy admirable defensivepositions, which could be held by comparatively few troops.The Strength of theBritish and french forces on the&quot;Western Front.A. With reference to the remarks made from time to time bythe French, and notably by their representatives at the recentAnglo-French Conference, in regard to the relative lengths of frontheld by the British and French armies respectively, the Director ofMilitary Operations gave the following figures :  .The number of German battalions opposite the British front is &apos;2 per mile ;The number of German battalions opposite the French front is2&quot;8 per mile ;excluding the Vosges sector, which is very thinly held by bothsides.Stated in different terms, there are 1&apos;9 French and 1*4 british battalions respectively opposed to I German battalion.The Accident inBoulogne Harbour.5. The First Sea Lord and the Director of Military Operationsreported a serious accident due to the sinking of a ship in BoulogneHarbour. The best salvage experts are at Avork on the hulk, but some considerable time must elapse before the Channel is cleared.The worst effect of the accident is the delay caused in the transportof railwav material.Rumours of anIntended enemy attack onWalcheren.6. The Prime Minister read a telegram which stated that certainindications tended to show-that the Germans were contemplating an&apos;attempt to seize Walcheren from the sea. The First Sea Lord saidthat the object of the enemy would be threefold (a.) To obtain a fresh submarine base.(6.) To release the shipping locked up in Antwerp.(c,) To use that port as a base from which to invade England.The Director of Military Operations stated that the GeneralStaff had no information regarding any concentration of enemy troops for this purpose.Possibilities of a landing in Pear ofthe Left Flank ofthe Allied Armieson the western front.7. With reference to the preceding minute, the First Sea Lordsaid that he was niore anxious about a reported enemy concentration on the left of the Allied Army in France in the vicinity of Nieuport,with a view to the landing of a force which would operate in rear of the extreme left flank of the Allies. In reply to his enquiries,Admiral Bacon had expressed his apprehension that the French line in this sector was too thinly held, only one French division and aweak Belgian division opposing three German divisions. The first sea Lord proceeded that our information showed that there had lately been much railway activity on the German front there.Lord Curzon stated, from his personal experience some monthsback, that the Allied defences in this sector were very powerfullyconstructed.
The Director of Military Operations said that the possibility ofa German advance on Meuport had been carefully considered bythe Admiralty and the War Office in May last, and that enemymovements in that direction would be carefully watched.Guns for merchant ships.8. The War Cabinet had before them : (a.) The weekly report on the progress made in the arming ofmerchant ships.    (Appendix I.)(6.) The proposals of the Conference held at the Ministry o Munitions on the 20th December, 1916, on the provisionof guns for merchant ships.   (Appendix II.)The points dealt with by the War Cabinet are given in thefollowing paragraphs.The Possible Use of18-pr. Guns.Attended in Gonnec-tionwith minutes, 9, 10 11, 12,13, 14, 15, 16,and 17.Dr. C. Addison,M.D., M.P., Min.of Munitions.Sir J. Maelay, Con-troller of Ship-ping.Major - General &quot;W.T. Furse, M.G.O.Major-General F. B.Maurice, D.M.O.Major-General F. C.Shaw, Major-General, GeneralStaff, home forces.9. The First Sea Lord reported that the 18-pr. gun is not assuitable as the 12-pr. for naval purposes. Having regard, however,to the urgent need for guns for merchant ships, and to the fact thatit may be possible to obtain large numbers of 18-prs., both by new orders and by utilising partly-worn 18-pr. guns released by theArmy, it was agreed that it would be desirable to utilise them forwant of a better weapon.In the course of the discussion it became plain that theprovision of mountings was the limiting factor in the arming ofmerchant ships. In this connection the Minister of Munitionsstated that his Department had prepared, a design, and could probably render some assistance. The Major-General, General Staff,to the Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief, Home Forces, stated thatthere was an 18-pr. mounting in actual use for Anti-Aircraft defence which might be adapted for merchant ships.It was decided that the Admiralty should at once get out adesign for a special mounting for the 18-pr. ; should be furnished with the design of the Ministry of Munitions ;and should also examine the design referred to byGeneral Shaw.Proposed diversion of Guns from Anti-Aircraft Defence to merchant Ships.10. The War Cabinet agreed with the First Sea Lord that totake 100 3-inch 20 cwt. guns away from the Anti-Aircraft Defencesto be mounted in merchant ships could not be approved.Proposed diversion to Merchant ships of a Proportion of future Supplies of anti-aircraft guns.11. The War Cabinet referred for examination by the AirBoard, in the first instance, the proposal that a proportion of thefuture output of 3-inch 20 cwt. guns should be diverted from the anti-Aircraft Service to the arming of merchant ships, providedthat the Admiralty considered this weapon and its mounting suitedfor the purpose. The First Sea Lord undertook to investigate thelatter question.New Orders to bePlaced with theBethlehem Com-pany.12. With regard to paragraph 3 of the proposals of theConference held at the Ministry of Munitions (Appendix II), it wasdecided that the Ministry of Munitions should consult with theAdmiralty as to the suitability of the weapon mentioned.French Guns.13. The First Lord reported that the French Admiralty hadarmed the whole.of the French Mercantile Marine with guns of onedescription or another.    The Minister of Munitions stated that he
was in communication with M. Thomas as to how much assistance could be rendered by the French in sparing guns and mountingsfor British ships.Coast Defence 14. The Major-General, General Staff, to the Field-MarshalGuns. Commanding-in-Chief, Home Forces, stated that, so far as militaryinterests, apart from naval needs, were concerned, 65 12-prs. and 244*7 guns might be released from the ports on the South and WestCoasts. The First Sea Lord undertook to examine, from the navalpoint of view, how many guns could be spared from this source ofsupply, and to report to the War Cabinet..The First Sea Lord and the Major-General, General Staff, to theField-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief were asked by the War Cabinetto examine and report on the possibility of thinning the artillerydefences of the ports in all ports of the United Kingdom, includingeven the East Coast with a view to the release of some of the guns.General Shaw said that in the opinion of the Field-marshal commanding-in-Ohief none could be spared from, the East coast ports, which were even now not fully armed.Guns Intended forEussia.15. With regard to paragraph 6 (Appendix II), the WarCabinet decided not to sanction the depletion of the supply destined for Russia.Supplies from america.16. The Minister of Munitions undertook to examine thepossibility of a further exploitation of the resources of Americaand Canada.German Outrage inthe Case of the sinking of Steam-ship &quot; Westmin-ster.&quot;17. The War Cabinet approved the publication in England ofthe particulars of the sinking of this vessel, which had been sunkat sight without warning. The ship sank, in four minutes after being torpedoed 180 miles from land. &quot;The crew took to the boats.The Germans then proceeded to fire on the boats, and the boatcontaining the captain and engineer was sunk.The larger questions involved were reserved for furtherconsideration if this should become a settled policy of Germany.The proposed anglo-Prench-Italian Conference.18. With reference to the Anglo-French-Italian conference proposed at the Anglo-French Conferences held 26th to the28th December, 1916 (vide paragraph 5 of the Minutes of the conferences) a message was received towards the close of theMeeting to the effect that the French Government had agreed tothe Conference and were prepared to start on the 2nd January,Brindisi being suggested as the best place for the Conference, inorder that General Sarrail might be able to attend.The War Cabinet decided : (1.) That an immediate communication should be made to rome on the subject.(2.) That the Prime Minister and Lord Milner should attend onbehalf of the War Cabinet.(3.) That the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and theSecretary of the War Cabinet should accompany them.*2, Whitehall Gardens,December 29, 1916.(Initialled)D. LI.

Proposals of Conference held at the Ministry of Munitions on December 20, 1916,on the Provision of Guns for Merchant Ships.1. IT was stated that the War Cabinet had authorised the manufacture of 4-inch guns, according to Scheme (B), proposed in the letter from the Ministry of munitions to the War Office of the 14th December, with the exception of the proposed sacrifice of 4&quot;5-inch howitzers. This would yield 746 guns by the end of January 1918, this figure being post-dated one month as compared with the estimate forwarded in theabove letter.2. In order to make up the Admiralty requirements, it was suggested that 3-inch20 cwt. guns in air-craft defences, or due for delivery for this purpose, should be diverted to merchant ships These are coming at the rate of thirty per month up to atotal of 255, and it was suggested that 100 of these already in position should betransferred to ships. This would give altogether 355 3-inch guns, of which 100 wouldbe available at once, 135 more by April, and 120 more by July. The gun is a highvelocity gun, and is suitable for mounting on board ship without any furtheralteration.3. It was proposed that new orders should be placed with the Bethlehem Company,which would give deliveries of 50 18-pr. per month from July onwards, which couldbe used on board ship as 18-pr., or could release an equivalent number of 18-pr. from home manufacture, which could be converted to 13-pr. 9 cwt. if this weapon isconsidered superior to the 18-pr. for the purpose in hand.4. These suggestions, together with 200 4&apos;7-ihch and 50 15-pr. to be released from the army, give the following results for the year : 4-inch under Scheme (B) (less 4-5-inch proposal): .. .. - .. 7463-inch 20-cwt        ..          ..          ..          .. .. .. .. 35518-pr. or 13-pr.      ..          ..          ..          .. .. .. .. 3004-7-inch   ..          ..          ..          ..          .. .. .. .. 20015-pv.      ..          ..          ..          ..          .. .. .. .. 501,6514-inch required      .. .. .. .. .. .. ..     1,800Only a portion, however, of the 1,651 guns shown wall be available in the first half of the year, the number of the various calibres being as follows.: 4-inch under Scheme (B) .. .. .. . .. - -        853-inch       ..          .. .. .. .. .. .. 2804-7-inch    ..           .. .. .. .. .. ^        .. 20015-pr.       ..          .. .. .. . . .. .&apos;. ..         500155. The Conference then considered other possibilities for obtaining guns in theearly part of 1917. The only proposal that seemed likely to furnish satisfactory resultswas to supply worn 18-pr. coming back from France. A supply of 18-pr. mountingssuitable for ships could, commence from May onwards, if instructions were given atonce, and it was suggested that steps should be taken to prepare these with aview to utilising 200 or 300 worn guns returned from the field in April or May.The effect of this in the supply in the field w?ould depend on the amount ofammunition expended during the early part of the year and the rate at which the gunswear out.If the wear of guns in the field is as rapid as is feared, and expenditure is at therate of 1,200,000.a week, it will not be possible to repair guns until late in 1917 atlherate they will be condemned. The transfer of, say, 300 worn guns would not,therefore, reduce the income of repaired guns, which will be limited until late in theyear by manufacturing capacity.6. In addition to the 4-7-inch guns already earmarked for the Admiralty, thereare 56 with Territorial Force units in home defence. These could be released byprovision of 60-pr. But the Admiralty could not supply mountings for some timeunless production is very much accelerated.    If 60-pr. are used to re-arm these
batteries none could go to Russia in April, May, or June, and the War Cabinet should say whether this should be done.7. A decision is required from the Admiralty as to the suitability of 18-pr., 13-pr.(9 cwt.), and 3-inch (20 cwt.) guns, and whether 4&apos;7-inch should be taken from territorial force units at home.If the 18-pr. is approved, it is proposed that immediate steps should be taken toproceed with the provision of suitable mountings, but without committing the ArmyCouncil to hand over any particular number of guns until after further experience asto wastage in 1917.PRINTED AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE BY o. R. HARRISON. 1/1/1917.
