The War Cabinet discussed at some length the action to betaken with regard to Greece. The Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff explained the military aspects of the question. From amilitary point of view, he said, it was most desirable not to go towar with Greece, but the present position was intolerable, as the concentration of Greek troops at Larissa threatened the flankand rear of the Allied forces based on Salonica. The greek army, it was true, was not a formidable one. At the presentmoment, however, from 15,000 to 20,000 men were concentrated in the neighbourhood of Larissa, and these might be raised toa force of from 50,000 to 70,000 men. The Allied forces in the region of Monastir might, in the near future, be in considerabledanger if the enemy released troops from the Panamanian front,which he could now do, to attack in Macedonia. It was, therefore,necessary to take immediate action to remove the danger from theGreek forces. His advice was that we should continue to enforce the blockade until the Greeks had withdrawn all their forces fromThessaly to the Morea. His information was to the effect that the greeks only had wheat for some three weeks&apos; consumption, includingthe Morea, and six weeks&apos; stock of petroleum, the stocks of coalbeing sufficient to last to the end of January, or, with greateconomy, until the middle of February. Most of these stocks were at the Pireeus, and it was desirable that their distributionshould not be permitted.The First Sea Lord pointed out that instructions had beenissued to the Vice-Admiral Commanding Eastern mediterranean to co-operate with the French Commander-in-Chief, and orders hadbeen given him that the mobilisation and concentration of theGreek army towards Larissa should be delayed ; that the railwaybetween Larissa and Athens should be attacked by airmen; thatammunition dumps and military stores at Larissa or elsewhere,within reach of aerial attack, should be destroyed by airmen ; andthat the railway in the vicinity of Mount Olympus, within reach ofthe sea, should be destroyed by air attack or gun-fire; but thatGeneral Sarrail&apos;s consent must first be obtained. Unless instruc-tions were sent to the contrary, action might be taken at any moment in execution of these orders.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that instructions had been given to General Milne to assist the Vice-Admiral in anyway he could.The Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign affairs pointed out the risk that General Sarrail might take such action as would drive us into war at once with Greece. He said that theGreek Government had made a protest against the Allied blockade,and he advised that we should give the Greeks clearly to under-stand that the blockade would not be removed until they had given reparation for the unjustifiable attack on the Allied troopsin Athens. He read a draft reply to the Greek protest, which was discussed.The War Cabinet were generally averse at this stage to anyminor operations, such as raids by aircraft against the Greekcommunications, which, on the one hand, would only inflict temporarydamage, and, on the other hand, would actually constitute acts ofxvar.   They decided on the following action: (1.) The Foreign Office should send a telegram to Greece basedon the following principles : (a.) The Greek troops in Thessaly should be withdrawnat once to the Morea. Failure to commence thenecessary movements within tioenty-four hours would be regarded as an act of war.(b.) Any movement of troops from the Morea north-wards would be regarded as an act of war.
(c.) The blockade would be continued until we obtainedreparation for the acts already committed, and guarantees for the future.A copy of the telegram actually, sent is printed in Appendix II.Copies of the instructions to the british minister in Athens to be sent&apos; simultaneously to paris, Rome, and Petrograd.The British Minister, at Athens should be instructed that he should make a communicationin this sense to the Greek Government as soonas his colleagues received their instructions.(2.) The Admiralty to send instructions to the Vice-admiral commanding, Eastern Mediterranean, not to take any action, such as the destruction of bridges or railways, orotherwise to commit any act of war apart from theblockade, until he receives further instructions.(3.) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff to send a corre-sponding communication to the General Officer Com-manding the British Expeditionary Force in the Balkans.Propaganda. 4. Sir Edward Carson read a letter from Rome, which had been communicated to him, regarding the harm done by the aoti-Venezelist propaganda in Italy.The &quot;War Cabinet decided that the whole question of british propaganda was one which would require consideration at an earlydate.K.C.B.The American 5. Sir Robert Chalmers explained to the War Cabinet theExchanges. present position as regards the American Exchanges.    He said that,in September 1916, the Treasury had appointed a Committee, underAttended for this     Lord Reading, to confer with French delegates on this subject,Question: atld. the British representatives had first investigated our ownThe Lord Ounhffe,   position.    They  had found that we were spending 60 millionGovernor of the   d0\iavs a weck in the United States of America.   This includedBank of England.   an estimate of 12   million dollars utilised  for the purpose ofSir Robert. Chal-   maintaining the Exchange.    The maintenance of the Exchangemeis, aO... was an essential pivot of the finances of the Entente Powers.^t/&quot;m&quot;^ra^ur7&apos; The remaining 48 millions, which estimate had been confirmed bythe experience of October and November, was utilised as payment for the purchase of different commodities required by theAdmiralty, the War Office, the Ministry of Munitions, or theAllies, and included sugar, &amp;c. It had been found that loans tothe extent of 1.500 million dollars would be required before the endof March next. Messrs. Morgan, Grenfell, and Co., who acted as our agents in New York, had been somewhat staggered by theamount, but had said that we must strain every nerve to&apos; obtainthe money, and had advised a second loan in November on thebasis of collateral security, as we had in the summer got beyondthe point where British credit could carry a loan without collateral.This second loan had been negotiated on this basis. It had then been hoped to obtain a straight loan in the United States inJanuary, when money gets easier. We had raised 300 million dollars on our November collateral loan, but we had spent this, and now had a debt of 175 million dollars outstanding on short money in the United States of America. When we obtained our lastcollateral loan we were looking forward to a straight loan of 500millions in January, when suddenly the whole situation was changedby the issue of the Federal Reserve Board&apos;s announcement tobanks. The representative of Messrs. Morgan, Grenfell, and Co.in New York then advised us that wehad, as it were, to begin
at the beginning again, and gradually build up our position,they advised that nothing could be raised in the form,of a straight loan in January, or until the effect of theFederal Reserve Board&apos;s announcement had worn off. We were,therefore, left at the moment with a prospective weekly expendi-ture of somewhere near 50 million dollars, in addition o sheExchange.    The  amount  required,   however,   to  mai&apos; theExchange, instead of remaining at 12 millions, as esti..iau,-d last september, had been gradually rising, and last week had reached6-1 million dollars. For this week the total had reached 70 million dollars. Sir Robert Chalmers, however, was able to congratulate theWar Cabinet on the fact that the amount required daily had dropped in the last two days from 17 million dollars first to 8 million and then to 4 million dollars. However, the amount required forthe maintenance of the Exchange was still Arery far in excess ofthe 12 million dollars estimated by the Treasury Committee. Inthe absence of loans the only way to balance the Exchange waseither to take less in goods, or to give more, that is to say, in gold or in American securities.Mr. Bonar Law explained that the question on which he wishedto have the decision of the War Cabinet was whether- we wereto send a&quot; telesrram to the Allies asking them to restrict purchases in the United States of America, as had been contemplated by theGovernor of the Bank of England.The Governor of the Bank of England said that the proposedtelegram, the despatch of which had been advised by the ExchangeCommittee, was now rather out of date. He had consulted theExchange Committee that morning, and their view had modifieda little in accordance with the improved Exchange situation.After hearing the gist of the telegram xchich it had been pro-posedto send, the War Cabinet decided that, in view of the improvedExchange situation, to send the telegram would alarm the Alliesunnecessarily.They further decided that, at the earliest possible date, a con-fercnee should be arranged with the representatives of Russia,France, and Italy. This conference should include, not only theChancellor of the Exchequer and corresponding Ministers of theAllies, but also the heads of the Governments, and should be heldin Paris. The initiative for arranging the conference should rest with the Chancellor of the Exchequer as soon as he considers itconvenient.6. The War Cabinet decided that the policy of curtailing orders in the United States of America, which has been pursued duringthe last few days, should be continued without making any announcement.The Balkans. 7. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff drew attention tothe proposal of the French Government that two additional divisionsAttended for  this   should be sent to Salonica by France and Engkxncl respectively.Question: According to the latest decision, he said, the Allied forces based onVice-Admiral Sir Salonica were to be raised to a total of twenty-one and a half1-1. F. Oliver, divisions, exclusive of the one and a half divisions which Italy hadK.C.B., M.V.O., been asked to send, and the additional British division involved in chief of the War this increase had already arrived. Both the British and FrenchStall,Admiralty, forces at Salonica, however, still required many drafts, which hadbeen delayed owing to transport considerations.The new proposal, he said, had two objects :-(i.) To meet the Greek menace ; ,(ii.) To meet a probable big attack by the Germans.
As regards the first, the reinforcements could probably not reachSalonica for some two months, and hence would not arrive in timeto meet the situation in regard to Greece. As regards the secondobject, the additional divisions proposed were not enough to enablethe Allied forces to hold their present very extended line against such reinforcements as the enemy might send down. He estimatedthat the enemy might bring fifteen divisions, raising his total force to thirty-five divisions. The utilisation of these larger forces waspossible because the Germans now had a new line of approachthrough Rustchuk, Adrianople, and Dedeagatch. He pointed outthat the communications of the Allies, being by sea, could not compete with the superior communications of the enemy by land. Oar forces would not arrive sufficiently soon to relieve the situation in Greece,and would not be adequate to cope with a great attack by theenemy against our present front. The Allied forces based onSalonica were now strung out on a 200-mile line. Thev consistedlargely of poor troops, and included many nationalities. TheSerbians,&apos;who had fought well, were to a great extent exhausted.Owing to the defeat of the Roumanians and the attitude of greece, the situation in the Balkans had undergone a completechange, and the plan agreed to at the Chantiily Conference, toknock out Bulgaria by simultaneous operations from the Danubeand Salonica, was now out of the question. Sir William Robertsonsummed up his advice as follows : &quot; None of the objects for which we went to and remainin the Balkans can now be attained. It is impossible tomaintain and employ there a sufficient force to exert a decisiveeffect on the war in our favour. We ought therefore towithdraw altogether from the country, but as this proposal isprobably not practicable for the moment, for political reasons,we should, at the most, definitely adopt the policy of holdingSalonica defensive^. It would be incurring an undue risk toattempt to defend it in the position now occupied by theAllied forces, even if the latter were strengthened by anotherfour divisions, having regard to the possible strength of theenemy attack and the Greek menace. It would obviously be a disadvantage lo withdraw from the present position,but to withdraw would be far preferable to being driven back,as that might lead to a real disaster. General Sarrail should therefore decide when to withdraw, being guided by the developments of the situation. Meanwhile, steps should betaken at once to select and prepare a defensive and an appro-,priate line for covering Salonica and protecting the left flank,so that the troops may be leisurely and smoothly withdrawn toit when the occasion arises.&quot;Sir William Robertson considered that the force at present at salonica should amply suffice to hold a suitable shorter lineagainst any attack that could be brought against it, provided that adequate measures are taken in time to prepare and occupy it, andthat the troops are properly commanded. He added, however, thatthe whole question was difficult and complicated because a foreignGeneral, over whom we had no control, was in command ; that hehad no confidence in General Sarrail&apos;s ability as a Commander;and in general that he had considerable misgivings, because of hisignorance as to General Sarrail&apos;s real attitude and that of the1&apos;rench Government.The War Cabinet decided that the Chief of the Imperial General &apos;Staff should communicate his views to General J off re. In doing so,he should state that the situation in the Balkans caused considerable anxiety to the War Cabinet, who wished to have a meeting betweenthe French naval and military authorities, but that, as a preliminary to this meeting, the War Cabinet consider it essential that the views[1365-1] - C
of the local naval and military authorities should be obtained, andespecially that General Sarrail should report explicitly on the toholesituation.8. The War Cabinet were advised&apos; by Lord Curzon, as formerPresident of the Shipping Control Committee, that it was extremely doubtful whether the necessary shipping could be found for theproposed additional divisions.The First Sea Lord undertook that the Admiralty i could examine this question before the Conference referred to above.The Shipping 9. The  Prime  Minister  informed  the  War  Cabinet thatDirector. Sir Joseph Maclay was to be appointed Shipping Director.   At the outset he was to take the presidency of the Shipping control committee, but was to have extended powers, as to whiclfhe would himself report, after examination.The War Cabinet directed their Secretary to invite the Admiralty *and^ the Board of Trade to give. Sir Joseph Maclay every possiblefacility and assistance.10. The Secretary was directed to issue a communique to thePress after the first meeting following the confirmation of newMinisters in their offices, to the effect that the War Cabinet had met, and would continue to meet every week-day, so that no furtherannouncements would be necessary. *PressCommuniques ofWar CabinetMeetings.The Arab Revolt.Rabegh.A ttended  for   thisQuestion :The Right Hon. A.(Jhambeilain,M.P., Secretaryof State forIndia.11. The War Cabinet discussed at considerable length thequestion of the expediency of sending a British force to Rabegh.Rabegh is a small port, situated on the main road from Medinato Mecca. Although there are alternative routes inland they arebadly supplied with water, and, so far as information is available,it seems probable that the Turkish force at Medina can only marchsouth to Mecca, with the object of ousting the Sherif, by the road which passes through Rabegh. A considerable quantity of stores,supplied by the Allies to the Sherif, including a number of aero-planes, is concentrated at Rabegh, which consequently possessesconsiderable strategical importance.There has for some time been much conflict of opinion as tothe desirability of sending troops to defend this place.The military view, which was explained to the War Cabinetby the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, is that to send troops toRabegh is to divert them from more important theatres from whichthey cannot be spared; that we cannot judge of the extent of the commitment; that even if we send the troops with the objectmerely of providing a passive defence of Rabegh, it will be verydifficult for them to avoid going to the assistance of their Allieswho may be suffering defeat a few miles distant in fact, the troopsmight be compelled to do so in their own interest; that it is dangerous to send too small a force, which might be exterminated,and that two infantry brigades, with the necessary auxiliary arms,and the administrative services, amounting to about 15,000 men,is the smallest force which it would be safe to send; that the climate is very bad, and the water supply quite inadequate; thatthe troops now in Egypt are urgently required for the operationsabout to be undertaken in the near future in the direction of el Arish, and that the exploitation of this operation will be frustrated by the withdrawal of troops to Rabegh ; and finally,that Egypt holds our only reserves to meet eventualities in the
[1365-1]DEast, the situation in Macedonia is- serious, and sea communica-tions between England and the East are difficult and precarious.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff is, for the above reasons,very strongly against embarking on another campaign, notwith-standing the political arguments to the contrary.The political view, whh-h was laid before the War Cabinet byLord Curzon and Mr. Chamberlain, is that we cannot allow theSherif to be overwhelmed ; one small State after another that has,willingly or unwillingly, espoused the cause of the Allies has beenshattered ; it is particularly important not to allow the downfallof the Sherif, as the effect on our prestige throughout the east would he disastrous; if the cause of the Sherif is allowed tocollapse, the probable result will be still larger demands on our military forces for dealing Math the difficult situation which maybe precipitated in various parts of the East.. One objection to the landing of troops in the Hedjaz is the religious difficulty that non-Moslems are not permitted in thatcountry. Reports have been received to the effect that the nativetroops would dissolve if they found themselves supported byEuropean forces, and therefore that the despatch of the force would defeat its own object. On the other hand, other reportsstate that in the last resort they would welcome assistance, and theSherif himself has asked for it. The Indian Government are aversefrom sending Christian troops to the Hedjaz under any cix&apos;cum-stances, but Mr. Chamberlain informed the War Cabinet that atthe present time his Military and Political Advisers at the IndiaOffice have come to the conclusion that this is a less evil than the collapse of the Sherif.The question is complicated by the fact that the French had offered to send infantrv, but have not vet communicated whattroops they proposed to send,, or the date at which they could arrive.The War Cabinet had before them a number of telegrams con-taining the views of the Sirdar, who holds that neither British nor-Ereneh brigades should be sent to Rabegh except in the last resort, but that preparations for landing troops in case of emergency should be made, aud a brigade bo sent if necessary to prevent the capture of Mecca by the Turks. Lord Curzon and Mr. Chamberlainagreed with him, provided that there was still time to prepare a proper defensive position before the Turks could arrive.The news contained in the latest telegrams is to the effect thata movement of the Turkish troops from Medina towards the coasthas been made, but it is impossible as yet to judge whether they intend to attack Ytnbo or Eabegh.The War Cabinet decided on the following action : (a.) The Foreign Office should ask the French government whether they have decided to send a brigade, and, if so,what troops they proposed to send, and when they will beready.(b.) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff should direct theGeneral Officer Commanding the Egyptian ExpeditionaryForce to prepare a brigade for the use of the Sirdar ifordered.(c.) The Foreign Office should direct the Sirdar to take anya.ction possible with&apos; a view to the -preparation of amilitary position at Rabegh, in readiness for occupation by the Allied forces on their arrival.
(d.) Pending a reply from, the French Government, theAdmiralty should examine into the question of watersupply at Rabegh.(Initialled) D. LI. G.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,December 9, 1916.Note.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff asks that it may be.recorded here that, having stated his objections to embarking onstill another expedition, the developments of which cannot before seen, he does not in any way wish further to call into question the policy of the War Cabinet to detail a force with the mission of denying Rabegh to the enemy, but he desires to repeat hisopinion that if any force is sent its strength and compositionshould be that already proposed by him as being necessary to carryout the policy. Whether this, or, indeed, any other force, can beso employed depends mainly upon the water supply, regardiugwhich the information in the Sirdar&apos;s possession is very imperfect.Further, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff wishes it to be understood that the success of the El Arish operations will be impaired to an extent corresponding to the reduction made by thedespatch of the Rabegh force. He also points out that if only an infantry brigade is sent, it is likely, in such a climate as that ofRabegh, to have within a short time not more than 3,000 effectiverifles at the most, and, perhaps, considerably fewer; and, irre-spective of the inadequacy of such a force as compared with his proposals, he stated that the despatch of one infantry brigade,without a due proportion of the usual auxiliary arms, is a measureopposed to the elementary principles of military organisation and efficiency, and may lead to serious consequences.

Elliot.Athens, December 11, 1916.Tour telegram, Private and Secret, of the 6th December.Please communicate following message from His Majesty toKing of Greece :-(R.) &quot; I have received your Majesty&apos;s telegram of the 6thDecember. The recent events that have occurred in Greece have caused me deep pain and concern. I am unaware of the conspiracyto which you refer, but I know that no agents of the Allied Powers
were connected with anything of the kind. The Allied Powers have,from the outset, confined their demands upon Greece to the observance of a benevolent neutrality. Unfortunately this conditionhas not been observed. Not only have the proceedings of your majesty&apos;* Government been open to grave objection, but the AlliedPom crs hive received indubitable proof of action on the part of theGreek Governments both damaging to their naval and militaryinterests and of direct assistance to the enemy&apos;s forces.&quot; This made it necessary for them, in the interests of their ownsafety, to ask for certain material guarantees, in the justifiability ofwhich, it is only fair to observe, your Majesty had given reason tobelieve that you were disposed to agree. When, however, difficultiesarose with your Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to the executionof those guarantees, the Allied Powers saw themselves obliged to order certain formal measures at Athens in the nature of a militarydemonstration, in order that the Greek Government should realise that the demand of the Allies was serious. Your Majesty was fully informed beforehand of the nature and scope of thosemeasuies, and gave to the Allied Commander, two days before the- demonstration was to take place, a written assurance of themaintenance of public order. Belying on this assurance, smalldetachments of Allied troops were landed, only to be met by anunsuspected and unprovoked attack by Greek troops, posted forthis purpose by the Greek Government.&quot;I take note of your Majesty&apos;s assurance that you deplorethe useless bloodshed, and I note with satisfaction your declaration that you harbour no designs against the Allied Powers and will never attack them. But ray Government can only take a veryserious view of the events resulting in the death of .my gallanttroops. These events have aroused a feeling of deep and wide-spread indignation among my people : a feeling intensified byaccounts received from many including neutral sources of thetreatment to which Yenizelists in Greece are now being subjected.Your Majesty will understand that the demands wdiich, inconjunction with the Allied Powers, my Government muse now make, will include reparation for the unprovoked attack made by your troops and guarantees for the future.&quot;APPENDIX II.Telegram to Sir F. Elliot (Athens), December 9, 1916.Recent events in Athens have proved conclusively that neitherthe King nor the Greek Government have sufficient control over theGreek army to prevent Greek forces becoming a menace to peace and a clanger to the Allied armies in Macedonia.Under these circumstances the Governments of the AlliedPowers are constrained to demand, for the security of their forces from attack, that the Greek troops now stationed in Northern Greece be immediately removed to the Morea, and that the evacuation commencewith hi twenty-four hours and proceed as rapidly as possible. they further demand1 that any movements of Greek troops from theMorea to Northern Greece .be immediately suspended. Failure tocomply with these two demands will be regarded by the Allies asan act of hostility on the part of the Greek Government.The. blockade of the Greek coast will be maintained until fullreparation has been given for the recent unprovoked attack by theGreek forces upon the troops of the Allies at Athens, together withsatisfactory guarantees for the future.You should make a formal communication to the GreekGovernment in the above terms as soon as your colleagues havereceived similar instructions.feinted at the foreign office  bx  c. e. harrison.  23/12/1916.
