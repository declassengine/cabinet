THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff, in the course ofhis usual statement at the outset of the meeting, reported thatEl Arish had been abandoned by the enemy.2. With reference to Minute 5 of the meeting of the21st December (War Cabinet 13), the First Sea Lord,in the courseof his usual statement at the outset of the meeting, reportedB
that, for the purpose of nieetiug the immediate and pressingnecessities of Italy, five colliers have been detailed from admiralty service. The amount of tonnage thus provided falls far short ofthe Italian requirements, and the War Cabinet therefore ask theFirst Lord to take the matter in hand and see whether a few morecolliers cannot be spared during the next few weeks for the con-veyance of coal to Italy.The Publication of 3. The First Sea Lord reported the loss in collision of two newNaval Losses. destroyers, viz., the &quot; Hoste &quot; flotilla leader and the &quot; Negro,&quot; with a loss of about 60 lives. Eight officers and 103 men had been saved from the &quot; Iloste,&quot; and 1 officer and 35 men saved from the &quot; Negro.&quot;The War Cabinet discussed the expediency of publishing this information. On the one hand the Admiralty report that thepublication of this information wouid unquestionably be of value to the enemy, who would otherwise probably not learn of these losses. On the other hand there is the clanger of the news leakingout in an exaggerated form and the creation of a bad publicimpression that bad news is being concealed.The War Cabinet decided that the public interest would best be served by publishing the fact of the sinking of two destroyers, together with the losses and the number ofthose saved, without mentioning the names or type of theships. The announcement should include a statement thatthe relatives of the men who had lost their lives had beeninformed.The Surrender ofMercantileShipping by theAdmiralty.Attended for   thissubject :Sir J.

With reference to Conclusion 10 of the War Committee of the28th April (W.C.-37) and Minute 5 of the War Cabinet Meeting ofthe 21st December, the First Sea Lord reported that the whole ofthe tonnage asked for by the War Committee in April last had beensurrendered, except approximately 20,000 tons.5. The First Sea Lord reported that, according to information received that morning, the rate of output of merchant shipping for next year did not exceed 400,000 tons during the first six months,as compared with submarine losses amounting to about 300,000 tonsa month.The Shipping Controller, however, reported that he had information to the effect that, provided the necessary labour andmaterial were available, an output of 1,000,000 tons deadweightcapacity might be expected during the first six months of next year.Dilution of 6. The War Cabinet urged on the First Lord the importanceLabour at the of dilution of labour.   The First Lord stated that he was givingShipyards.. his personal attention to the matter, and that he had instructedMr. Pretyman to give a large part of his time to the matter.Consultation with 7.

He had also ascertained that any difficulty which mightbe raised by the inclusion of representatives of India could be surmounted by treating this as a special War Conference, and*not as a meeting of the ordinary Imperial Conference, the constitu-tion of which could only be modified by the unanimous consent ofthe Conference itself. There were difficulties arising from the domestic situation, about the attendance of several of the PrimeMinisters, which might possibly make it necessary for them to sendtrusted colleagues.*It icas generally agreed that the invitation should be, not to an ordinary Conference, but to attend the War Cabinet for the discussionof urgent matters arising out of the war.

Serious dis-appointmeut had been felt by the Dominions at the very inadequatefulfilment hitherto of the promise given early in the war that theyshould be consulted, and there was a fear on their part that theymight be asked to make a sacrifice of their conquests in order tomake it easier for His majesty&apos;s Government to fulfil its pledges to Belgium or France.The status of the Indian representatives was raised by theSecretary of State for India, and after some discussion it was agreedthat there could be no ground for objection on the part of theDominions to the presence of the Secretary of State as the [ndianrepresentative, with assessors selected by him in consultation withthe Government of India, whose views could lie invited at the meetings.Telegrams for transmission to the Dominions and India by theSecretary of State for the Colonies and the Secretary of State forIndia were drafted and, after discussion, agreed to.

9. The War Cabinet continued the discussion (temporarilysuspended, owing to the change of Government) of the late war committee of the First Report of the Air Board. The draft conclusions of that Committee were to the effect that (1.) The Air Board should continue to fulfil the functions&apos;. allotted to it, devoting special attention to the questionof the proper allocation of the aerial resources of thecountry, whenever conflict or competition arise, asbetween the Admiralty and the .War Office.(2.) A Fifth Sea Lord should be added to the Board of theAdmiralty in order to represent that Department on theAir Board, with a status and authority corresponding to- that of the Director-General of Military Aeronautics.(3.) A representative of the Ministry of Munitions should beadded to the Air Board.(4.) The design and supply of aircraft should be transferred from the Admiralty and the War Office to the Ministryof Alunitions.(The Draft Conclusions are appended to these Minutes as appendix II.)The. question before the War Cabinet was whether or not theyshould endorse the Draft Conclusions of the late War Committee.The First Lord of the Admiralty and the First Sea Lorddesired to associate themselves with the view held by their predecessors in office, except as regards the appointment of anadditional Sea Lord for the Air.The First Sea Lord desired to express in the strongest termshis opinion that the policy of making the Admiralty dependent on another department for the design and supply of aircraft would be disastrous. Pie drew attention to the position of the Admiralty inregard to its dependence on the War Office for the design and supply of naVal ordnance and naval ordnance stores prior to 1890and to the successive steps which had been taken to render theAdmiralty independent in. this respect. These steps had led togreatly increased efficiency, and he considered that with this experience before the Admiralty he is bound to dissent from a policy.which would render that Department dependent on either the AirBoard or the Ministry of Munitions for the design and supply of.aircraft.The First Sea Lord also criticised the report of the Air board in regard to its remarks on the alleged indifference of the Admiraltyrespecting the production of airships, and read extracts froma paper on this subject submitted by the Board of Admiralty to the Cabinetin 1913, which expressed strong views on the necessity for a forward airship policy, and which proposed a definite programme to carry out those views.The First Lord agreed with the views stated by the First sea lord, and they both expressed the hope that they would have anopportunity of scrutinising whatever scheme of transference mightbe put forward, before they took action.(A memorandum on the subject, prepared by the First Lord ofthe Admiralty, was read out by him to the War Cabinet, andis appended to these Minutes as Appendix III.)The President of the Air Board again pointed out to the WarCabinet that the proposal to transfer design and supply of aircraft from the two War Departments to the Ministry of Munitions was acceptable neither to the Admiralty, nor to the War Office, nor tohis own Board.
The War Cabinet decided that, in view of the very largenumber of urgent questions requiring their immediateattention,&quot;they would not be justified in reopening aquestion which.had been so exhaustively investigated bythe late War Committee.They approved in principle the Conclusions on the subjectdrafted by the Secretary after the Meetings of the late war Committee held on the 27th and 28th November,1916, under which the design and supply of aeroplanes (asapart from, airships and seaplanes) will in future be vested in the Ministry of Munitions, the responsibility for operations remaining with the Admiralty and the WarOffice.They further decided : (a.) That the details of the new arrangement should be worked out by the Air Board, the Admiralty, and the WarOffice, in consultation with the Ministry of Munitions.(b.) That the inspection and approval of aircraft, manufacturedunder the orders of the Minister of Munitions, should still be in the hands of the Admiralty and the WarOffice respectively.Lord Curzon desired that it should be recorded in the Minutes,of this Meeting that he dissented from this decision of his colleagues on the War Cabinet.(Initialled)D.

Proposed Amended Telegram to Self-governing Dominions.I WISH to explain that what Plis Majesty&apos;s Government contemplate is not aBession of the ordinary Imperial Conference, [but. a special War Conference of theEmpire. Further], they invite your Prime Minister to attend a series of special and continuous meetings of the War Cabinet in order to consider urgent questions affectingthe prosecution of the war, the possible conditions on which, in agreement with our allies, we could assent to its termination, and the problems which will then immediatelyarise. For the purpose of these meetings your Prime Minister would be regarded as amember of the War Cabinet.In view of the extreme urgency of the subjects under discussion, as well as oftheir supreme importance, it is hoped that your Prime Minister may find it possible, inspite of the serious inconvenience involved, to attend at an early date, not later thanthe end of February. While His Majesty&apos;s Government earnestly desire the presenceof your Prime Minister himself, they hope that if he sees insuperable difficulty he willcarefully consider the question of nominating a substitute, as they would regard it asa serious misfortune if any Dominion were left unrepresented.Telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy, dated December 22, 1916.(Secret.)With reference to announcement made by Prime Minister in House of Commonslast Tuesday, I have to explain that what His Majesty&apos;s Government contemplate isnot a session of the ordinary Imperial Conference, [but a special War Conference of theEmpire. Further], they are inviting the Prime Ministers of the Dominions to attend aseries of special and continuous sittings of the War Cabinet in order to considerurgent questions affecting the prosecution of the war, the possible conditions on which,in agreement with our Allies, we could assent to its termination, and the problems which will then immediately arise. For the purpose of these meetings the PrimeMinisters will be regarded as members of the War Cabinet.His Majesty&apos;s Government have invited the Secretary of State for India to representIndia at these sittings of the War Cabinet and at the special War Conference. I desire the assistance of two gentlemen specially selected for the purpose in consultationwith you, as foreshadowed in Lord Hardinge&apos;s speech in the Legislative Council on the22nd &quot;September, 1915.It is hoped that the meetings may take place not later than the end of February.APPENDIX II.Wae Committee/Draft Conclusions of Meetings held at No. 10, Downing Street, on November 27 and november 28, 1916.First AT three meetings held on the 27th November and the 28th November, the Wareport of Committee considered the First Report of the Air Board, dated the 8th August, 1916,a reply to the same by the First Lord of the Admiralty, dated the 6th November, andother Memoranda by the President of the Air Board and the Ministry of Munitions.The conclusions of the War Committee are as follows : (1.) The subject of immediate urgency is to supply aeroplanes in sufficient numbers and of the best possible types for the two services,-but moreparticularly for the use of the British Expeditionary Force, whose presentsupremacy in the air is threatened by the great efforts which the enemy&apos;s*     is known to be making. I
(2.) The object stated above can, in the opinion of the War Committee, best beachieved by handing over the supply and design of aeroplanes, both for theNavy and the Army, to the Ministry of Munitions, which already possessescontrol over the labour and materials essential to aircraft construction. in arriving at this decision, the War Committee have given most careful andanxious consideration to the alternative courses presented to them, namely,the course favoured by the Admiralty, that supply and design should remain as at present, and the proposal of the Air Board that supply and design should be vested in the Air Board itself. While they recognise that both these alternatives have much to commend them, and while they areimpressed by the support given to the Air Board by the Director-Generalof Military Aeronautics, the Director of Air Organisation, and the NavalSuperintendent of Aircraft Construction, the War Committee, after hearing the views of the experts of the Ministry of Munitions, believe that thedecision, as stated above, is the one best adapted to the circumstances ofthe moment.(3.) The War Committee attach great importance to the maintenance of an AirBoard, not only to fulfil the functions allotted to it on the 11th May(W.C. 41, Conclusion 3), but more particularly for the purpose of allocating the aerial resources of the country between the xAdmiralty and war Office, wherever there is conflict or competition between them.(4.) In order to facilitate the relations and to secure uniformity of procedurebetween the Air Board and the Admiralty and War Office, the war committee, with the concurrence of the First Lord of the Admiralty,approved in principle that a Fifth Sea Lord should be added to the Boardof Admiralty. This additional Sea Lord would represent the Admiralty on the Air Board, and should, as far as possible, mutatis mutandis, have a status and authority corresponding to that of the Director-General ofAeronautics, who became a member of the Army Council at the time whenthe Air Board was first constituted.(5.) The War Committee also approved that a representative of the Ministry ofMunitions should be added to the Air Board.(6.) The distribution of responsibility between the authorities concerned in theuse and production of aircraft will, in accordance with these decisions, infuture be as follows : (a.) The Admiralty and War Office will concert their respective aerialpolicies in consultation with the Air Board.(b.) The Admiralty and War Office will formulate the programmes of aerial production required for the fulfilment of the approvedpolicy, and will submit these programmes to the Air Board,(c.) The Air Board will &quot;decide as to the extent to which it is possibleto approve the departmental programmes, having regard to thepossible rate, of production, the needs of the other Department,.and the respective urgency of the demands.(d.) The Air Board (Admiralty and War Office) will place the order.with the Ministry of Munitions,(e.) The design of the machines and commodities ordered will beundertaken by the Ministry of Munitions, working in the closest possible association with the Department for whom the order is placed.(/.) The Ministry of Munitions will give every facility for directcommunication on all matters of detail between the repre-sentativesbf the Admiralty Air Department and the Departmentof the Director-General of Military Aeronautics respectivelyand the actual manufacturers.(g.) Any of the Departments represented on the Air Board, and theAir Board itself, will have the right of appeal to the &apos; war committee in case of dispute.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,November 28, 1916.
The Admiralty and the Air Board.I DO not propose to enter into the controversies which are so amply dealt with inthe literature already prepared and circulated. If the War Cabinet has decided,contrary to the great weight of opinion at the Admiralty, to divorce the Naval AirService from the Admiralty and place it under the Air Board, the question now to beconsidered is to what extent this is to be carried out and how far the division of responsibilities can be deiined with the least disadvantage to the Naval Air Serviceand the best advantage to the Air Service generally.I hope, in working out this pi&apos;oblem, it may be borne in mind that in the middleof a war we should take care to have the least possible dislocation of departments atthe Admiralty, and also that delays in construction and supply should be, as far aspossible, obviated.&apos;Question of Supply.? Airships As I understand the present position, it is suggested that this should be handedand over to the Ministry of Munitions.   I do not consider that this is a good arrangement;panes. anflpersonally I should prefer that the responsibility for supply towards the admiralty should rest with the Air Board, and that we should not be involved with two departments. The Air Board would of course make such arrangements as they thinkbest for construction and supply with the Ministry of Munitions, or any such other way as they think most expeditious and satisfactory.Design.I do not know whether it is intended that this should be handed over to the AirBoard. I hope it may not be so. But if it is, I must point out that it will benecessary to evolve a system by which the users of the machines should be broughtinto close contact with those who design and construct. From the information I havereceived at the Admiralty I believe that it has been this close connection that has ledto the satisfactory production by the Admiralty of aeroplanes in the past.Inspection and Approval.The Admiralty must retain the right of inspection and approval of all machinessupplied to them for Admiralty purposes.Policy and Operations.The policy and operations of the Naval Air Service must, of course, continue inthe hands of the Admiralty, By &quot;policy&quot; I mean the working out of the actionbetween naval operations and air services, and the functions for which the Air service is to be used in all matters of defence and offence which are entrusted to the. Navy.As regards operations, the First Sea Lord is, in the Admiralty, the director of all naval operations, just as the Commander-in-Chief in France is the director of all militaryoperations in that theatre of war, including the Air Service. It will be essential,therefore, that the direction of all Air Service operations connected with the navy should remain under the direction of the First Sea Lord.Programme.The programme of design and construction for the Admiralty I suggest must be framed by them. No doubt, when this is submitted to the Air Board who will alsobe responsible for supplying the programme of the Army Air Service in the event ofthe full programme not being possible, it will be necessary for the Air Board, in con-sultation with the Admiralty, to decide as to whether any reduction in programme canbe carried out.
Staff.In the Naval Air Department, for duties connected with aeroplanes and seaplanes,there are 59 Royal Naval and Royal Naval Reserve officers and ratings, 146 royal naval Volunteer Reserve officers, and 95 civilians (most of the Royal Naval volunteer reserve officers are civilians with temporary commissions) a grand total of 300. Theduties cover design and inspection of planes and engines, armament, wireless and electricity, finance and accounts, and registry. In the Contract Department, theduties are not wholly discharged by any one section, and the estimate cannot be basedon actual numbers, but on an appreciation of the amount of time involved in thedischarge of air work. Omitting the principal supervising staff, it may be said thatthere are some fifty to sixty officials and clerks employed. In this calculation no provision is made for work performed by the departments of the Engineer-in-chief,the Director of Naval Ordnance, and other technical departments ; nor yet for anycontract work connected with the supply of guns, bombs, steel wire, cordage, &amp;c, norfor the passing and paying&apos;of contractors&apos;claims, which operations are inextricablymixed up with the similar work performed for other naval services. It should be observed that, though it might be possible to transfer a staff adequate on paper&quot;4or the performance of the work to be transferred, it would not be possible to guarantee inevery case the transfer of the man whose brains contribute to the efficiency of the.work. It should also be added that as the Admiralty would, under Lord Curzon&apos;proposal, still be responsible for general equipment as well as repairs and replacements,some staff would still have to be retained for the purpose.Assuming, however, that the staff can be transferred in the manner suggested, andthat their relations to the Military staff can be satisfactorily settled, which wilL not be easy, it will still be necessary to determine the relations of the Board of Admiralty tothe Air Board in connection with the matters described by Lord Curzon as &quot; processes of Supply.&quot; ,The arguments against the amalgamation of the air duties of the Board of Inventionand Research and of the Munitions Inventions Department have been stated in the correspondence with the Air Board; and though from a naval point of view no advantage is expected to be derived from it, yet if other duties are transfer-red, this one might certainly be allowed to go. As regards experiments, howrever, the Admiraltyought, as user to retain the right to carry out certain experiments in connection wdthaircraft, as it does in connection with guns and their mountings. It should, however,be clearly understood that none of the sources of experiment, which have hitherto been available for the Admiralty, whether manufacturers or others, should be abandonedwithout good reason. Admiralty experience is against reliance being placed wholly ondepartmental staff and factories.   This is particularly important as regards design.Personnel.I presume the selection and training of the personnel will remain, as heretofore, ? Difficultyunder the Admiralty. of providing-It will thus be seen that the handing over of the Naval Air Staff is a matter of *ec^o?e Airsome complexity, and will involve a careful consideration of how many of the staff Service.Can be spared, having regard to the duties which will still have to be carried out bythe Admiralty; and I would suggest that, with a view to dislocating as little aspossible the existing arrangements, the whole question should be carefully worked out between the Air Board and this Department before any attempt is made to set thenew scheme under the Air Board in motion ; otherwise there will be dislocation and delays which would be fatal under existing circumstances.New Air Lord.Having regard to what I have hereinbefore stated, I do not see what object wouldbe gained in appointing an additional Air Lord. I do not think there would be enough work left in relation to the Air Service to justify such an innovation ; and itcan be easily arranged that whoever has been appointed to supervise the residuum ofthe work at the Admiralty should be the representative of the Admiralty on the AirBoard.
MUNTSD AT THB IORBIOX OMIOJS 5T C K. HABKISON.-27/12/1s16.It is very difficult to form an estimate as to how far a scheme on the lines Ihave laid down is likely to work smoothly and efficiently without seeing how they areto be incorporated in the full programme that the Air Board have in view. Theremay probably be other suggestions which will be essential when this has been.fumished.E. C.Admiralty, December 18, 1916.
