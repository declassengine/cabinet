THE War Cabinet considered a telegram (Appendix I) fromthe Rear-Admiral Commanding the 9th Cruiser Squadron, at sierra leone, stating that he had been requested by the Governor ofSierra Leone to arrange the water transport of 1,100 troops andcarriers to Lagos within twenty-four hours, and of another 1,600troops and carriers within the next ten days. These troops were required owing to an advance of the Senussi forces towards the nigerian frontier. The Governor had also asked for a force fromthe Squadron. The Rear-Admiral suggested that the &quot; Swiftsure &quot;should take such balance of the 1,100 men as could not be accomodated on the steamer requisitioned by the Governor, aswell as a force of 280 marine officers and men from the &quot; Swiftsure,&quot;&quot; King Alfred,&quot; and &quot; Sutlej,&quot; with one 12-pr. and two maxim guns,which was being held in readiness to proceed.The First Sea Lord pointed out the undesirability of sendingmarines, unequipped for the purpose, 1,000 miles up-country. Inany case it was undesirable that ships should be kept hangingabout, as they might be wanted to pursue raiders in the Atlantic.The War Cabinet decided that: The Rear-Admirals suggestion as to the transport of 1,100 menand 280 marines should be carried out, but that themarines should not be landed until instructions were received from the Government.
2. The Secretary of State for the Colonies informed the WarCabinet that he had no special news other than that conveyed tohim by the Admiralty in their telegram, but the Colonial Office had learned on the 3rd January of the fall of Agades, and the advanceof the Senussi in the direction of Tawa and Madowa, the latterplace being about 125 miles from Sokoto (Appendix II). TheColonial Office had also heard that there was some unrest amongstthe Touaregs, but there was no reason to believe that there was anycaus^ for anxiety. The natives in the neighbourhood of Sokotowere quite quiet, and provided they remained loyal, there was noreason to anticipate serious trouble. He had, however, telegraphedto Sir F. Lugard to ask if he had received any communications fromthe French Governor-General on the subject, and he had alsoinstructed him in the event of the French asking for assistance,not to 1 commit himself to the despatch of troops without firstreceiving the consent of His Majesty&apos;s Government.This action was approved by the War Cabinet.The Loss of a 3. In reference to the statement made by him at the Meeting ofTransport in the the War Cabinet of the 3rd January, 1917 (War Cabinet 26,Mediterranean. Minute 1), the First Sea Lord reported that he had since beeninformed that the captain of the &quot; Ivernia &quot; had been authorised bythe Naval Commander-in-Chief, Malta, in order to save time, to cross by daylight the area in which the ship was torpedoed, andwas therefore free from the blame imputed to him. Sir JohnJellicoe also informed the War Cabinet that the necessity for thispermission having been given was under investigation.(Initialled)      A. B. L.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.January 5, 1917J
