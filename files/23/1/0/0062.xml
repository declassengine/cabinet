The Nationalisation 4. The War Cabinet had under consideration the followingof Shipping. Papers on the subject of the Nationalisation of Shipping : (a.) A Memorandum by the Shipping Controller, dated the 25thJanuary, 3 917 (War Cabine:,&quot;Paper G.-I22).(6.) A Memorandum by Sir Leo Chiozza Money, dated the26th January, 1917 (War Cabinet, Paper G.-123).(c.) A letter to the Prime Minister from the Shipping Controller,dated the 2nd February, 1917 (Appendix II).from the technical point of view of the manning of the armament and the working of the special apparatus for providingprotection against submarine mines, which  had been fitted to merchant ships, and that of the training of the crews, and for thepurpose of enforcing the directions of the Admiralty in regard tothe routes to be followed by merchant vessels, it was recognisedthat there was much to be said in principle for the nationalisation of merchant shipping, and the incorporation of the personnel in aGovernment Service. It was pointed out, however, that Stateownership and a personnel employed by Government, might giverise to difficulties with neutrals in regard to the entry of our shipsinto their ports, particularly when these vessels were armed.Several variants of nationalisation were discussed, e.g. : The adoption of an arrangement similar to that in force inregard to the railways of Great Britain.The nationalisation and complete control of shipping for the duration of the war.Complete and permanent nationalisation was excluded, as ithad been distinctly specified by the Prime Minister, in his statement in the House of Commons on the 19th December, 1916, that &quot;Duringthe war the shipping will be nationalised in the real sense of the term.&quot;There was general agreement that some means must be found of preventing the excessive profits made, by shipowners owing tothe high freights produced by war conditions, as set forth in theMemorandum by Sir Leo Chiozza Monev (War Cabinet, paper g.-123).The War Cabinet decided that- (a.) The Shipping Controller should extend the requisitioning of tonnage at Blue Book rates so as to make it generaland as nearly as possible universal, and that the cases towhich requisitioning did not apply were to be justifiedonly by exceptional circumstances.(b.) The Shipping Controller should report to the War cabinet weekly, or at regular intervals, the progress made inthis matter.(c.) The profits should be dealt with in a manner corre-sponding, mutatis mutandis, to that adopted in the caseof the railways, i.e., by assessing the profits by theaverage over a period of time preceding the war, andthat the Shipping Controller shoiild be asked to reportto the War Cabinet as to the effect of taking for thatpurpose the average profits made during the two, thuee,four, and five years, respectively, preceding the war.
The Consumption 5. The War Cabinet decided that of Petrol.Having regard to the drastic limitations about to be placed onthe use of petrol by the civilian population (Appendix III),it was imperative that the Admiralty and the War office should impress on all persons under their control the greatimportance of exercising the most rigid economy in theconsumption of this spirit.Control of Canals. 6. Idle- War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandum(Appendix IV) prepared, at their request, by the President of theBoard of Trade on the subject of the Control of Canals (WarCabinet, 53, Minute 9).They approved a proposal of the President of the Board of Tradeto take immediate steps to take possession of such canalundertakings as appear to be essential for the maintenanceof important traffic connections, reserving the questionof taking over the minor undertakings for subsequent consideration, the control being administered through aCommittee representing the three Departments (theMinistry of Munitions, the Quartermaster-General^ Depart-ment, and the Board of ITade), the canal owners, and perhaps the Railway Executive, with a Chairman appointedby the Board of Trade.The War Cabinet decided, however, that The proposal to suspend the further enlistment of canalemployees for the present should be discussed between theBoard of Trade, the War Office, and the Department of theDirector of National Service, and should be brought to theWar Cabinet in the event of disagreement.(Initialled)      D LI.

The Prime Minister to Mr. Hughes, Australia.GERMAN submarine campaign, coupled with large and groAving demands f war transport in 1916, compelled us to take the most stringent measures with our shipping. The new Government took control of all British shipping and all new construction yards, partly to put an end to excessive shipping profits, and partly tomake best and most economical use of every available ship already afloat or about tobe launched, and also largely out down imports. Latest phase submarine campaignnow forces us to even more drastic measures, partly because of increased sinkings, andpartly because it is causing increasing refusal of neutral ships to come to war areas.We are, therefore, about to announce a further drastic curtailment of the nationalimports, and are endeavouring to purchase or obtain control of as much neutral shipping as possible. But in order that all possible steps may be taken to prevent such a grave diminution in war supplies vitally necessary to Allies as will seriouslyhandicap their military efforts, as Germany hopes, we feel it necessary to ask you to examine urgently the employment of vessels in the Australian coasting trade inorder to release as many as possible for war service either by reducing require-ments, replacing by land transport, or substituting neutral ships. Many neutralswhich refuse to trade in war areas would willingly work in areas free from warrisk. Fully recognise these steps would mean sacrifices for Australia, and that employment of neutral ships may raise difficulties in regard to wages and labour.But in view of the serious danger of our war supplies being partially stopped, we feel that we are justified in asking you to do everything you can to liberate shipping for war purposes.APPENDIX II.Shipping Nationalisation.Letter from the Shipping Controller to the Prime Minister.Dear Prime Minister, February 2, 1917.SINCE the discussion at the War Cabinet last week I have given earnestconsideration to the question of the Nationalisation of Shipping, keeping in view yourpromises relative thereto.I think you may justly consider shipping to be nationalised on the lines you aim at when you secure the absolute control of every ship of the British Mercantile marine and deal with the profits exactly as you elect.   Such is the case to-day.Under the system of requisition and ship licensing, no British vessel can go onany voyage without direct authority from the Government, and the control is thusabsolute.Then with regard to profits, you can deal with these in various ways : i. You can give the average of two years before the war plus a percentage on allextra profit earned.2. You can do as my Memorandum suggested, and simply apply the existing machinery of the Excess Profits Tax, making the Exchequer proportion as high as you like.3. You can give the average of two years before the war and anything more, or nothing.4. You can deal with shipping on the exact lines of Controlled Establishments,wddch get the average of two years before the war plus 20 per cent.My own mind is clear. I believe it is a mistake not. to leave an incentive to mento exert themselves to the utmost, however trifling that incentive may be. In myopinion, the definitely fixed figure in Controlled Establishments is a blunder. Thereis absolutely no incentive to economy, and the results are just as might be expected.In many shops you get neither care of time nor of money, and the same applies verymuch to railway companies.   I therefore specially recommend for your consideration
APPENDIX III.Consumption op Petrol.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.TUE total amount of petrol imported into this country in 1916 was : Gallons.JanuaryFebruaryMarchAprilMayJuneJulyAugustSeptemberOctoberNovemberDecemberTotal6,985,2797,522.3779,( 7S.62215,725,16510.348,78919,^20,83711,526,60028,773.05313,.&quot; 32,42010,399,25518.004,0114,100,8581G1,814,706The total requirements for all purposes are as followsArmy Expeditionary forcesHome forces        .. .. .. .. ..Navy        .. .. .. .. .*total all other purposes  IPrivate motor-cars . . .. ..Private motor-cycles .. .. .. ..Doctors&apos;and veterinary surgeons&apos;carsHackney vehicles (omnibuses, taxi-cabs, &amp;c.) ..Commercial vehicles .. ..Industrial processesTotalGallons per month.4,000,0001,075,000000,0005,075,0001.350,000300.000450,0003,200.0003,200.0001,500,00010,000,000Of  the 4,000,000gallonsrequired monthly by the Army abroad, about975,000 gallons is shipped direct to the Army, and is not therefore included in the161,814,766 gallons imported into the United Kingdom. The requirements of theArmy in France are, however, increasing, and may be expected to increase very rapidlyon the commencement of offensive operations on a large scale. More petrol is beingconsumed than is brought into the country, and the stocks in this country are rapidlydiminishing, as the followdng figures will show : Gallons.December 9th,,     16th,,     23rd30thJanuary   6th13th37,450,83936,168,22933,424,32530,822,48028,650.83925,966,716either No. 1 or No. 2 of the above suggestions. Under either you take the two years&apos;pre-war average as your basis, and hy granting a percentage, however small, on allextra profit earned, you will secure the wholediearted effort on the part of- shipownersand their staffs, through whom we must continue to work.I think no greater mistake could be made than by attempting to take over in anyother way British shipping. You retain all the advantages of the experience of practical men who know their business, and also, as far as possible, all the elaborate system built up by private enterprise and pay nothing for it, and there isthe further certainty that, after the war, owners will be able, without loss of time, to resume their regular services.Yours verv truly,(Signed) j. P. MA CLAY
It is very unlikely that the same amount of tonnage for carrying petrol will beavailable during the current year in fact, there is ample evidence to the contrary. Itis therefore imperative that the consumption of petrol must be still further restricted,and I have instructed the Petrol Committee to adopt more stringent measures in orderto bring about an immediate reduction in the total monthly allowance for all purposes other than the Army and Navy. It is estimated that it might be possible to limit these requirements to 8,000,000 gallons per month, which would reduce the total consumption an eluding naval and military requirements) to about 164,000,000 gallonsper annum ; but to make a reduction below this amount would seriously disturb thebusiness of the country by entailing a very serious diminution of omnibus services,practically a complete stoppage of ail private cars, a further curtailment of taxi-cabs,and a reduction in the number of cars used for commercial purposes.The users of petrol have during the last six months been subject to severerestrictions, resulting in many cases in considerable hardship, and serious protests havebeen made by a large number affected by these regulations. A further limitation will undoubtedly revive these complaints, and pressure will be brought to bear for some relaxation. It will probably be suggested that if greater economy in the use of petrolwere exercised by the Government Departments, particularly the War Office and admiralty, more petrol would be available for the essential needs of the country. i therefore suggest that the attention of these Departments should be called to theextreme importance of taking every possible stexj to keep their consumption of petrolwithin the narrowest possible limits.(Initialled) A. II. S.Board of Tro.de, February 2, 1917.APPENDIX IV.Control of Canals.(Note by the President of the Board of Trade.)THE position with regard to canal traffic has recently become serious, owingpartly to the enlistment of canal workers, and partly to the fact that the canalcompanies are losing men to munition works, owing to their inability to pay auadequate war bonus.A good deal of the canal plant is at present idle, 40 barges, for example, out of200 on the Bridgwater Section of the Manchester Ship Canai, and 60 barges on theShropshire Union Canals are out of commission.It has been strongly represented to the Board of Trade, both by the Ministry ofMunitions and by the Railway Executive Committee, that any further interference withthe existing facilities for the conveyance of goods by canal would throw amadditionalburden on the railways, which are already over-taxed, and might result in&quot;an actualinterference with the carriage of war material.Both the Ministry of Munitions and the Board of &quot;Trade have represented to theArmy Council that the further enlistment of canal workers should be suspended, andthey have suggested that canalmen should be put on the same footing as railwaymen,and should not be called to the colours unless released by their employers. The ArmyCouncil have not, however, so far seen their way to agree.In the opinion of the Board of Trade, the maintenance of canal traffic is nownearly as important as that of railway traffic. Railways and canals are in effect onesystem, and should be so treated. They consider that, the chief portions of the canalsystem should be brought under Government control in the same way as the railwayswithout delay with a view to ensuring that, railway and canal traffic are properlyco-ordinated, and the canals are used to relieve the railways to the utmost of their capacity, and also that adequate war bonuses are paid in order to retain a sufficientstaff and prevent disputesAt a conference held on the 1st February between representatives of the Board ofTrade, the Ministry of Munitions, the Railway Executive Committee, and the War
Office, the whole question was discussed, and it was decided to put forward thefollowing recommendations : 1. That the important canals should he kept open, as the railways cannot take the traffic.2. That canalmen should, for the time being at any rate, be put on the same footing as railwaymen with regard to enlistment.3. That the canals essential for traffic should be taken over by the Government,and adequate war bonuses paid to the employees, and4. That an Executive Committee should be appointed to manage them, including representatives of the Canal Companies, the Railway Companies, theMinistry of Munitions, the Quartermaster-General, the Board of Trade, andpossibly the bye-traders.The Board are not yet in a position to make a definite proposal as to the terms onwhich the owners of the canals should be compensated. They would endeavour toarrange for a guarantee based on some figure less than the revenue for the last pre-war year, but the extent to which the 1913 figure should be reduced will have to be amatter for negotiation.Even if the 1913 revenue were guaranteed, it would appear, on the basis of theavailable figures, unlikely that the deficiency to be met on the canals taken over wouldbe as much as 250,000 . per annum. A good deal would, of course, depend on theamount of the war be nuscs it would be necessary to give.Subject to the approval of the Cabinet, the Board of Trade would propose to take immediate steps to take possession of such canal undertakings as appear to be essential for the maintenance of important traffic connections, reserving the question of taking over the minor undertakings for subsequent consideration. They would propose to administer the control through a Committee representing the three Departments, the canal owners, and perhaps the Railway Executive, with a chairman appointed by theBoard of Trade.The Board earnestly hope it will be found possible to suspend the furtherenlistment of canal employees until there has been time to look into the position as awhole.A draft regulation giving the Board of Trade the necessary powers is attached.DEFENCE OF THE REALM (CANALS).At the Court at Buckingham Palace, the Gth dag of February, 1917.Pre;ent:The King&apos;s Most Excellent Majesty in Council.Whereas by an Order in Council, dated the twenty-eighth day of November,nineteen hundred and fourteen, His Majesty was pleased to make regulations (called the &quot;Defence of the Realm (Consolidation) Regulations, 1914 &quot;) under the Defence ofthe Realm Consolidation Act, 1914, for securing the public safety and the defence ofthe realm ;And whereas the said Act has been-amended by the Defence of the Realm(Amendment) Act, 1915 ; the Defence of the Realm (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1915 ;and the Munitions of War Act, 1915 ;And whereas the said regulations have been amended by various subsequentOrders in Council ;And whereas it is expedient further to amend the said regulations in mannerhereinafter appearing :Now, therefore, His Majesty is pleased, by and with the advice of His privy council, to order, and it is hereby ordered, that the following amendments be made inthe said regulations : After Regulation 9g, the following regulation shall be inserted : 9h.
