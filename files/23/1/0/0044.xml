3. The Director of Military Operations reported that he hadbeen informed by General Dessino that General Alexeieff would resume his duties as Chief of the General Staff at Russian Head-quarters on the loth February of this year.The War Cabinet directed the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs to transmit a message in the following sense from the PrimeMinister, to meet Lord Milner on his arrival in Russia : &quot;At to-day&apos;s meeting the War Cabinet were informed thatGeneral Alexeieff will resume his position as Chief of theRussian Imperial General Staff vice General Ghurko on the15th proximo. The War Cabinet also learned that Ghurkoconsults Alexeieff on all matters of importance before taking action. The War Cabinet attach great importance to everyeffort being made by you and General Wilson to see GeneralAlexeieff before your departure, in order that you may discuss with him the whole general military situation. The WarCabinet are informed that Alexeieff is the real brain behind allRussian military operations.&quot;The Naval Action. 4, With reference to Minute 4 of the War Cabinet meetingheld on the previous day (War Cabinet, 43, Minute 4), the First sea lord made a statement regarding the recent naval action, whichamplified and, in one detail, corrected the information given atthat meeting by the Director of the Intelligence Division, AdmiraltvWar Staff.The First Sea Lord undertook to prepare, for the informationof the War Cabinet, a brief description of the naval action at anearly date.5. The War Cabinet had before them telegram No. 3431,from the Secretary of State for India to the Viceroy, dated the9th January, and the Viceroy&apos;s reply, No. 940, dated the 21stJanuary (Appendix I), containing an appreciation of the general position of affairs in Southern Persia, asked for by the War Cabineton the 8th January (War Cabinet 2d, Minute 5).The Secretary of State for India stated that he had before him a joint memorandum, prepared by the Military and PoliticalSections of his Department, on the situation in Persia. Theview of the India Office was that the Germans would make everyeffort to recover their hold .of the main line of communicationthrough Ispahan and Kerman during the coming year, in order to penetrate to Afghanistan and Baluchistan and to raise trouble inIndia. In the opinion of his Department the best way to meet anyserious threat against Persia by the Central Powers was an offensive in Mesopotamia; it. was not sufficient merely to seize and to holdKut-el-Amara. If an active offensive in Mesopotamia were notpossible, and if the Turks were able to advance on Shiraz in force,the position of Sir Percy Sjdtes would be untenable, and he wouldhave to retire on Bunder Abbas, maintaining himself in as advanceda position on the flank of the Turkish advance as was compatible with his own safety and the security of his line of retreat. the india Office endorse the proposals of the Government of India tosend small reinforcements to Shiraz, but these would suffice onlyto control the local situation.The Director of Military Operations reported that a Turkishforce of a maximum strength of four divisions was on its wayeither to Mesopotamia or to Southern Persia. If sent to the Tigris,these reinforcements would increase the Turkish force in that theatre to a number, in rifle strength, equal to our own. GeneralMaudes instructions were to make his weight felt as much aspossible without unnecessary loss of men, and to draw and containliussia.general   Alexeieff.
the Turks in that theatre. The present season was not favourable for an advance into Southern &quot;Persia, and when conditions were favourable the Russians would be able to act. If they were successful, a Turkish advance into Persia in strength was not very probable. General Maurice further stated that he was authorised by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff to say that Sir William Robertson fully concurred in the proposals of the Government ofIndia.It was suggested that the proposals of the Indian Govern-ment would in effect convert the Southern Persian Rifles from a civil gendarmerie into a military force and the displacement ofSir Percy Sykes, a political officer of great local experience and knowledge, by a military officer. It was suggested that this mightbe regarded by the Persian Government with suspicion, as Sir PercySykes had been specially appointed to act nominally as a Persiancivil official for the purpose of raising a gendarmerie, and had been selected mainly owing to his familiarity with Persian affairs.The War Cabinet were informed that the policy of the. ForeignOffice was to maintain the civil status of Sir Percy Sykes. This was inconsistent with the view of the General Staff, as expressed by theDirector of Military Operations, which was that the situation in southern Persia was such as to call for the substitution of militaryfor civilian control.It was pointed out that the proposal to appoint a military com-mander to control the operations in Southern Persia resulted from anappeal by Sir Percy Sykes for reinforcements ; that the situationwhich had given rise to this appeal had since calmed down, but thatit was probable that this situation might be recurrent and involve further appeals of a similar nature.The War Cabinet decided (1.) That before a final decision is arrived at regarding anychange of personnel or status of officers or forces em-ployed by the military and political staff in South Persia,the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and theSecretary of State for India should telegraph to theBritish Minister, Tehran, and the Government of Indiarespectively for their views on the points raised byLord Curzon and Lord Hardinge at the meeting.(2.) That a telegram should be sent by the Secretary of Statefor India to the Viceroy in the following sense : &quot; Your telegram No. 940 of 21st January. Im-mediate despatch of proposed reinforcements ap-proved. Presume that the officers and instructorsmentioned were asked for by Sykes for SouthPersian Rifles, and will be required for thatpurpose, whatever our decision as to military control and appointment of General may be. Thisquestion is reserved by the War Cabinet for furtherconsideration after receiving replies from you andMarling to questions which will be sent in anothertelegram.&quot;6. The War Cabinet had a discussion upon the tactical use of tanks.&apos; It was decided that, in view of the alleged difference ofopinion between the ideas of the Higher Command in France andof those responsible for the original conception, the design, themanufacture, and the development of Tanks, a Conference should beheld, attended by representatives of the British and French General Staffs, the Staff of the British Expeditionaiy Force, and of theBritish and French officers responsible for the design, production,and command of Tanks, in order thoroughly to investigate and b 2
report upon the manner in which Tanks could, in future operations,be utilised to the fullest tactical advantage.Mr. d&apos;Eyncourt and Lieutenant-Colonel Stern desired that theConference should consider the general use of Tanks, and mentionedas examples the following points which had been raised by thosemainly responsible for the design and production of these enginesof war: --(a.) That, in the view of the General Staff, the Tanks should beused as an adjunct to Infantry, and should be soconstructed as to be able to keep up with Infantry inthe attack.. (b.) That, in the view of the designers, Tanks should notnecessarily be used as an adjunct to Infantry, but should operate on the flanks of an attack, moving overareas which had not been pitted by shell-fire, and where they did not draw enemy shell-fire upon our ownInfantry.Rcmmania.Financial Assist-fuaee.7. In consequence of representations to the Prime Minister bythe Roumanian Minister in London that the roumanian government was in urgent need of funds, and had been unable toarrange for an advance from the Treasury, the War cabinet discussed the question with representatives of the Treasury andForeign Office.In the course of the discussion it was explained that the advance asked for was on account of a loan of 40,000,QOOZ. whichwas being negotiated. The delay in granting the advance was mainly due to the anxiety of the Treasury to ensure the properco-ordination of expenditure incurred by Roumania on the strengthof such an advance. The War Cabinet were informed, however,that an agreement on the subject was on the verge of being completed.The War Cabinet decided That, as regards financial assistance, Roumania was to receivegenerous treatment, and that His Majesty&apos;s treasury should be authorised to place at the disposal of theRoumanian Government sufficient credits in this country,within reasonable limits, to enable that Government tocarry on the war.(Initialled)      D.

From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Army Department, January 9, 1917.Secret No. 3.-131. South Persia. See telegram from Commander-in-Ohief,India, to Chief of Imperial General Staff, No. 203. War Cabinet have consideredwhole situation, and are of opinion that as operations round Shiraz have now assumeda distinctly military character, it will probably be necessary that Sykes&apos;s force,including South Persian Rifles, should bo placed under Government of India andcommand exercised by a military officer appointed by you. War Cabinet thereforewish for an appreciation from you of the situation as likely to develop in next fewmonths, and of the best means of dealing with it.    In particular, do you advise:  (1.) Occupation from Bushire of the plain tou try between Bushire and Daliki,for at any rate some mouths, on the understanding that troops are not to commit themselves to an advance into the hills ?(2.) Reinforcement of Shiraz from Lingnh or Bunder Abbas?(3.) If so, what troops would be required in either case, and can you supply them ?If you cau, what effect will this have on your other military commitments ?(4.) To ensure proper co-ordination between forces at Shiraz and Bushire, do you think it desirable that both forces should be under your control?(5.) What are your views as to Sykes&apos;s position and functions under suggestedarrangement ?(C.) Have you any other suggestions ?It will, of course, be understood that in all questions of policw regarding Petsia,Government of India will be guided by His .Majesty&apos;s Minister, Teheran, consultinghim as well as me and keeping us fully informed.Please repeat to Teheran, Commandcr-in-Chiefs telegram No. 203, this telegram,and all subsequent telegrams on this subject, emanating from you.From Viceroy, Army Department, 2.1st January, 1917.9-10. Your telegram of the 9th January, 3131. The concrete facts before us are(11 from all information, it appears that Turks in vicinity of Baghdad will be materiallystrengthened at an early date, possibly by as much as four divisions ; (2) the unrest in southern Persia may be ascribed to German and Turkish influence among the localy tribesmen. Erorn these two facts it is probable that enemy have not lost sight of their aim to push bodies of troops towards Afghanistan with a view to induce Amir to takesides against us. To accomplish their ambitions the Turks may intend (I) to endeayourtooverwhelm Maude at Kut-al-Amarah; (2) to await advent of floods and the hot weatherto pin him to his present position with sufficient troops whilst utilising bulk of their forces for a movement through Persia, which, in view of Russian menace to their com-munications, should the Turks advance via Teheran, is likely to follow a south-easterlydi reel ion via Ispahan. Climatic conditions favour attack on Maude being undertakenduring the cold weather ; the movement through Persia is preferably a hot weatheroperation. The development of Shiraz situation must therefore depend on successorfailure of plan as above outlined. So long as we maintain our present position on the tigris enemy&apos;s plans in Persia are impelled, their eastward move checked, andthe arrival of organised enemy forces in South Persia improbable. The features of present situation at Shiraz appear to be : the attack on Kazerun was primarilydirected against work of Governor Farman Earma, who is known to be our friend.The tribal forces engaged were robber bands instigated by German agentWasmuss, and unchecked by Soulet, bui they apparently permit caravans and individuals to move up and down Bushire-Shiraz road on payment of tolls.In respect of best means of dealing with situation, we consider it advisable: Firstly,to raise and organise Southern Persian Rifles efficiomtly on the same lines asunits of Indian Army and to place control and maintenance of this force under theCommander-in-Chief in India, who would nominate an experienced General Officer toexercise command and be the supreme British authority under Field Service Regula-
tions, Part 2, Chapter 3, Section 8, up to the borders of Baluchistan. His authority-must be supreme in all matters subject to instructions received from Government ofIndia. His instructions will be issued by Government of India under the orders ofHome Government, and after reference when necessary to the Minister at Teheran, whowill thus have opportunity of guiding policy to be followed. He must be free to actaccording to need of situation, in judging which he will have the advice of hislocal Political Officers, and in matters. beyond their competence that of Ministerat Teheran. But, on general military policy governing mission, strength, andobject(s) of his force from time to time, he will receive instructions from Governmentof India, who will, of course, frame these instructions according to general policyof His Majesty&apos;s Government, and after hearing the advice of Minister at Teheran.Secondly, to encourage trade on the Bushire-Shiraz road, and for this purpose topermit rebellious Khans outside Bushire to quietly re-establish relations with us without promising them anything in the future. We have previously proposed thispolicy, but hitherto it has not found favour at Teheran.As to your particular question, and in view of foregoing, we advise (1) againstoccupation of plain country between Bushire and Daliki. as it might lead to corri-plications with the hill tribes and involve an advance into the hills, i.e., a furthercommitment if it is to affect situation at Shiraz ; also after April the climatic conditions would be very severe for the troops. (2) There is no means for reinforcement ofLingah or 1 hinder Abbas. Steps are in train to send an escort with instructors and staff via Bunder Abbas to Shiraz, which will be available to reinforce Sykes should thesituation there demand it. (3) In addition to Bushire garrison we estimate that battalions, 2 mountain guns, and some mounted troops would meet requirementsof limited operations in the plain country north of Bushire, which isdeprecated in (!) above. To reinforce Sykes we propose to send a party of 10 officers and 53 British instructors with an escort of one companyMounted Infantry, one battalion Indian Infantry, and Cavalry and Artillerydrafts. The above can be supplied from India, their despatch reducing correspondinglythe troops disposable to reinforce other forces. They would take four 10-pounder gunsif relieved from. Din time by rearmament of mountain batteries there, and four machine guns. (4) It is desirable to have one officer under Commandei--in-Chief in India insupreme control of the South Persian theatre of operations, and the General OfficerCommanding, Mesopotamia, is fully occupied with mission assigned to him. More-over, he reports to Commander-in-Chief in India, who would thus be in a positionto co-ordinate all military action in South Persia and India with the military policyin&apos; Mesopotamia, and to advise Government of India and Chief of Imperial GeneralStaff accordingly. (5) We suggest that Sykes could be used as Chief PoliticalAdviser to the General Officer Commanding Forces of. South Persia, though we donot press this point. Should Sykes be recalled, then we suggest Gough to beChief Political Officer on the staff of the General Officer Commanding. (6) Noother suggestions present themselves to us, but we desire to emphasize the paramount importance of avoiding (a) anything in the nature of dual control ; (6) anycomplications likely to result in further military commitments without decidedcompensating advantages. i\.s the local opinion is that the spring migration ofNimakkashgai and Khamsieh tribes towards Shiraz will certainly increase risk ofcomplications there, particularly as the hot weather impedes the movement of troops from the coast, we hope to meet this risk in time to prevent [? irruption] by theimmediate support of Sykes.(The Foreign Department have repeated above to Minister at Teheran, under no. 99 S., 20th January.)o
