Submarines.1. The First Sea Lord reported several further actions between british surface craft and enemy submarines, without certain results.The casualties on the previous day from submarines were asfollows : British merchant-ships sunk- ArmedUnarmedTrawlersBritish merchant-ships attacked and escaped Armed ...     (torpedoed and beached)Unarmed1 British ship sunk by a mine.I neutral steamer and 1 sailing ship sunk.Nil.14Publication ofShipping Losses.ParliamentaryStatements on theG-erman Declara-tion of Blockade.The Destructionof enemy submarines:The Question of publication.G-uns for merchant ships:The Question of publication.2. The War Cabinet again discussed the question of publishing the losses- of merchant-ships, resumed from the previous day (WarCabinet, 63, Minute 3).   They decided that -The Admiralty should at once stop the publication of losses ofAllied and neutral merchant-ships, and that the publicationof the losses of British ships should be continued untilthe Admiralty shall have considered the whole question.3. The War Cabinet discussed the matter of the generalstatements to be made in Parliament in regard to the destructionof enemy submarines (War Cabinet 54, Minute 12). They decidedthat A statement might be made in the sense that the Admiraltyare not dissatisfied with the number of enemy submarinesthat they have reason to believe never returned home.4. The War Cabinet further decided that: A general statement should be made in the course of debate in Parliament, based on, but not quoting, the figures sincethe present Government came&apos; into office, the said figuresbeing as follows : Number of merchant ships armed oil the 7th December, 1,194.,, ,, ,,        ,,       ,,     11th February, 1,681.Comparison of losses of MerchantVessels in january and February 1917.5. The First Sea Lord undertook to furnish the War cabinet with a statement comparing the losses in merchant ships for thefirst eleven days of January and February, 1917, respectively, witha view to a statement being made in Parliament, if consideredadvisable.The FrenchRailways:Breakdown in theFrench NorthernRailway System.6. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumon the Railway Situation in the British Zone in France, preparedby the Imperial General Staff, dated the 12th February, 1917(Appendix I).The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that he attached great importance to a communication, in the sense indicated in his memorandum before the Cabinet, being at once made to the FrenchGovernment, because he was of opinion that the result of the projected operations will almost certainly govern, even if it doesnot actually decide, the final issue of the war. He reminded theWar Cabinet that, at the Nivelle Conference, Field-marshal sir Douglas Haig had pointed out that by taking over so muchadditional line the training of the troops under his command would
The German!Eerserves in personnel.Man-power:Enlistment of munition Workers.7. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff communicated tothe War Cabinet the information regarding the German reserves inmen (Appendix II), promised by him at the previous meeting(War Cabinet (33, Minute 7).8. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theArmy Council regarding the supply of men for the Army, datedthe .1.0th February, a Memorandum by the Secretary of State forthe Colonies on the same subject, dated the 10th February(Appendix III), and a Memorandum by the Minister of Munitionsdealing with the relation between recruiting and the output ofmunitions (Appendix IV).The War Cabinet decided that : (a.) Any dispute between the Recruiting Department of theWar Office and any other Government Department as towhether men engaged on a particular occupation could.be seriously interfered with, while he would have fewer troops forthe attack. Further, both Sir Douglas Haig and Sir William Robertson had stated at the Conference that it would be unwise to launch such, an important and vital offensive -provided theenemy allows us the choice before we ourselves are ready andtill all the Allied Armies arc? able to attack simultaneously.The War Cabinet, however, had decided against these views, andhad. requested the Field-Marshal to take over the whole of theadditional, line proposed by the French, and they had since orderedhim to comply with General Nivelle&apos;s wishes as to the date of the attack, &quot; employing the forces available at the moment.&quot; TheCabinet had further laid it down that &quot;on no account&quot; must theFrench be kept waiting tor us &quot; owing to our arrangements not beingcomplete.&quot; Sir William Robertson said that he had interpreted these instructions as meaning that Sir Douglas Haig is expected to attackwhether he be ready or not.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff added that he did not know whether the General Staff Memorandum of the 24th Januaryhad caused the War Cabinet, to reconsider and modify their views,but if they still thought that the state of our preparations must be subordinated to the plans and wishes of the French, notwithstanding the breakdown in the French railway system, in his opinion it was clear that Sir Douglas Haig could only do his best to ensure thesuccessful conduct of the operations, subject to the condition of therailways at the moment.; but in these circumstances he felt thatthe War Cabinet would agree that the responsibility of the result ofthe operations could not fairly be borne by Sir Douglas Haig.The War Cabinet decided that : The Foreign Office should communicate to the French Govern-ment the General Staff Memorandum, accompanied by covering letter, to be drafted by the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff, the latter to embody the representations madein Minute 9 of the 59th Meeting, and to explain the factthat the War Cabinet had supported G-eneral Nivelle&apos;s plansagainst the views put forward by Sir William Robertson andSir Douglas Haig, and that they had instructed the latter tocomply with General nivelle&apos;s wishes. The AVar Cabinet,therefore, feel a great responsibility in the matter, and consider that they are fairly entitled to say how disappointedthey are at the breakdowm in the French railway system,becaitse the feasibility of carrying out the plan of opera-tions agreed upon must obviously be greatly affected bythe railway facilities afforded, and they wish this point ofview to be fully apprehended by the French authorities.
in accordance with previous decisions of the WarCabinet, properly be called to the colours, should bereferred to the Director-General of National Service,whose decision, subject to there being an appeal to theWar Cabinet, should be final.(&amp;,) The Minister of Munitions should instruct all employerswithin his jurisdiction to make representations to the recruiting authorities in every case where a man, whounder the decision of the War Cabinet (W.C., 39, 1 (g) (i))primd facie appears to be entitled to exemption on theground of his occupation, receives his calling-upnotice.(c.)

The War Cabinet decided that Their decision of the 30th January (War Cabinet 48, Minute 11),with regard to Members of Parliament serving with the expeditionary Forces, should apply to Members of theHouse of Lords as wrell as to Members of the House ofCommons.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,February 13, 1917.(Initialled)d. li. g7-M   6Mr O
Memorandum on the Railway Situation in the British Zone in France.1. THE Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief has drawn attention to the serious situation which has arisen in connection with the transportation facilities placed at thedisposal of the British Armies in France, and to the effect which the failure ofthe railways may have upon the conduct of the forthcoming operations in sofar as those armies are co-operating in them, ft must be remembered that while theBritish authorities have assisted the French railways by supplies of rolling-stock andin other ways, the general understanding throughout the war has been that theresponsibility for the management and operation of those railways, and for the adequateservice of the British Armies in France by rail has rested with the French Militaryauthorities.2. From time to time discussions have taken place between representatives of theBritish and French Armies and War Offices. At those conferences the former have endeavoured to meet as far as circumstances permitted the demands for assistance,and in July last at the conclusion of a series of Conferences, General Belin, whopresided, made the following statement as reported in the proces-verbal:- &quot; General Belin declares that the agreement is complete as regards rolling-stock; both on number and type to be supplied, as well as the time within whichdeliveries are to be made.&quot;This declaration was understood by the British authorities to conclude the matter as it stood at that time, and since then they have taken every possible step to meet their obligations accordingly.3. After the Somme offensive, when the railway situation began to cause someuneasiness, further Conferences were arranged, which took place in Paris inNovember and December last, attended by representatives of the Staffs of the twoarmies. &quot; It was at this time, and as a consequence of a communication by MarshalJoffre, then Commander-in-Chief of the French Armies, that it was first formallybrought to the notice of the British Commander-in-Chief that the French railwaysrequired more extensive and general assistance. Steps were immediately taken torender that assistance as fully as circumstances permitted, and the withdrawal oflocomotives and rolling-stock from the British railways and their transfer to france was authorised, and is being carried out as rapidly as circumstances permit. these measures have only been made possible by drastic restrictions of railway facilities tothe public in this country, and by the curtailment of imports of various kinds to set free shipping for the conveyance of rolling-stock on its wheels to France. At thesame Conferences a programme of railway construction to be undertaken by both Britishand French on the railway system serving the British Armies was agreed to, and complete figures of tonnages to be carried were placed at the disposal of the appropriateFrench officials. The French authorities have, therefore, since November last beenfully aware of the foregoing circumstances, and the matter has also been the subjectof representations both verbal and written between Field-Marshal Sir Douglas haig and General Nivelle from the 26th December until the present time.4. It may be argued that British deliveries of rolling-stock in France have notfulfilled expectations owing partly to failure of Contractors, and also to the difficultiesof cross-Channel shipping, including danger from enemy submarines, but against this there is evidence that the breakdown in January was mainly due to the lack of capacity of the lines, and exhaustion of the operating, personnel, and locomotives onthe Nord system.5. It was not until the 23rd January that the impending failure of the Frenchrailways to cope with the situation was definitely though verbally admitted at aConference on other matters between the Directeur de 1&apos;Arriere and the Director-General of Transportation, and this informal intimation was immediately followedby drastic restrictions in traffic facilities afforded to the British Armies which are stillpartly in force with most serious consequences.6. On the 29th January, the Field Marshal Commanding-in-Chief arranged aConference at Grand Quartier General with the General Commanding-in-Chief of theFrench Armies, and the situation was discussed as a whole. General Nivelle expressed to Sir Douglas Haig the ability of the French railways by special efforts to handle[1365-64] C
British traffic on a scale of 200,000 tons import per week, in addition to the necessarylocal traffic, such as roadstone and timber required for the operations, and with this assurance Sir Douglas Haig hoped, even with the limited resources available, to be ableto carry out the agreed plan of operations.7. The following are the approximate figures of tonnages to be handled : (a.) Total weekly demands of the British Armies-Tons.Import.. .. .. .. .. .. .. 250,000Local traffic      ...        .. .. .. .. .. ..       100,000350,000(b.) Actual weekly traffic handled at end of January Tons.Import.. .. .. .. .. .. ..       150,000Local traffic      .. .. .. . . . . .. . .        60,000210,000(c.) Weekly traffic which General Nivelle, at meeting on the 29th January,expressed the ability of the French railways to carry by special efforts Tons.Import.. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..       209,000Local traffic      .. .. .. .. . . .. All required.From correspondence subsequently received by the Secretary of State for War fromSir Douglas Haig, however, it appears that the understanding reached at the Conferenceon the 29th January between himself and General Nivelle can only be realisedgradually, and after an indefinite period of time, and that even so it is only thoughtpossible by the French if considerable British assistance is given to execute works nowproposed for the first time, or which the French had previously undertaken to constructthemselves.8. It is obvious that the situation which has arisen is an extremely serious one,and justifies any steps, however drastic, that may be practicable to ameliorate it. Itis therefore recommended : (1.) That the French Government be requested to furnish a full statement of theimport and local traffic separately -ately, which they are prepared to guarantee to carry week by week until their capacity shall have reached the full requirements of the British Armies, as notified at the Conferences inNovember last.(2.) That civilian traffic of all kinds in the zone serving the British Armies shall be restricted to an absolute minimum. There are grounds for believing thata very considerable civilian traffic is now passing on the railways, and thatthis is by no means confined to the absolute essentials of life.(3.) That steps be taken to evacuate from the zone of the British Armies suchcivilian and refugee population as is necessary to relieve the railways ofthe excessive demands for the support of this population.(4.) That the French Government should immediately take steps to provide all thelabour that can be usefully employed on the works which their officersconsider necessary for the proper working of the full notified traffic of theBritish Armies, and, further, to withdraw from other parts of France suchrolling-stock, locomotives, and personnel, as may be required from time totime to deal adequately with the Bidtish traffic on the lines serving thoseArmies.(5.) That the British authorities should be kept fully advised from time to time ofthe progress of such works.9. So far as the British authorities themselves are concerned, arrangements arebeing made to augment still further the labour on roads and railways for the eon-struction and maintenance of which the British Armies are now taking responsibility,and to expedite as much as possible the despatch of locomotives, rolling-stock, and permanent way for France. If, thereafter, it is found possible to place labour at thedisposal of the French authorities for new construction or for works for which they undertook the responsibility, this can be done. It is satisfactory to note that, at therecent Conferences between Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig and General Nivelle, it
was agreed that experienced technical railway officers of the British forces shouldcollaborate with the officials of the Nord Railway in obtaining the best use of therailway facilities available, and there are good grounds for the hope that considerable improvement can be obtained by this means, provided such co-operation is encouraged to the fullest extent.10. In a communication to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, dated the 9thFebruary, the Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief reports that the construction programme undertaken in the British area by his Transportation Department is makingsatisfactory progress. Me points out, however, that the heavy calls on the fightingtroops for labour, have seriously interfered with training, and continue to do so.11. As regards the effect of the railway situation on the plan of operation decided upon at the London Conference on the 15th and 16th January, he makes the followingremarks : &quot; I have no means of knowing to what extent the railway situation hasdelayed preparations for the French offensive, nor do I know what proportionof the railway facilities has been retained by the French for their own use.&quot; In the absence of full and reliable information as to future railway prospects itis not in my power to give a date by which it will be possible to cany outmy attack 021 the scale I had intended.&quot;At my meeting with General Nivelle on the 29th January, 1917, it was agreedthat my Transportation Department should be brought into closer touchwith the French railway experts, and I hope that this will lead to a fullerknowledge of what facilities I can rely on, and when they will be available.&quot;Meanwhile, if the French commence their operations on the 1st April and stillmore if they commence earlier than that I can only comply with the war Cabinefs instructions, as to combination with them, to the extent of avery modified attack. This course, so far as the British Armies in France areconcerned, could have no more than a very local and temporary effect on theenemy, and would use up resources which would prejudice the success of subsequent operations.&quot;12. From the foregoing review of the situation it is apparent that when the plan of operations was decided on at the London Conference on the 15th and 16th January,the whole situation both as to railway capacity and the demands of the British Armieswas before the competent French authorities, who had even allotted to the british armies, at considerable inconvenience to themselves, adequate port accommodation todeal with the total forecast tonnage which their railways are now unable to carry.Nevertheless, within ten days of that Conference the French authorities were compelledto put into force drastic restrictions of the railway traffic at the disposal of the british armies in France, which have not yet been wholly removed. It is, therefore, essentialto the effective conduct of the rmojected operations, whether in a modified form, or at alater date than that originally mentioned, that the French authorities should definitelystate, for the information and guidance of the British commander, to what extent theycan be responsible for carrying the traffic of the British Armies, as communicated tothem in November last.Imperial General Staff, War Office.February 12, 1917.APPENDIX II.German Man Power.SIR BERNARD MALLET&apos;S Committee on &quot; Enemy Personnel &quot; reported on the9th September last that &quot; Germany would appear to have had at the end of May 1916 the followingreserves, which may be expected to take the field during the calendar year : In depots .. .. .. .. .. .. 1,000,0001918 class .. .. .. .. .. .. 500,000

&quot; This figure is a minimum. It is possible that it may have to be increased by700,000 (men released from industry&quot;), and, if the age limit is increased, by a further500,000.&quot; The maximum figure is, therefore, 2,700,000.&quot; If the Avar lasts till the spring of 1917, a further 500,000 youths from the 1919class will be available.&quot;The prediction regarding the number of men that would be absorbed during theyear has been fulfilled, as net casualties have amounted to about 1,000,000 and thestrength of the field units has been increased by about half a million.The predicted possible increase of 700,000 additional men from industries and afurther 500,000 by means of increasing the age limit has been more than realisedowing to the introduction of the National Service Law giving the Government power toapply compulsion to all persons between the ages of 17 to 60. It is estimated thatthese changes in the law have resulted in making some 500,000 more men availablenow than the above-mentioned Committee anticipated as the maximum. The totalfigures now available may therefore be : Released from industry (vide committee&apos;s report) .. .. .. 700,000Extending age limit        . .          ..          .. .. .. . . 500.0001919 class        ..          ..          ..          .. .. .. .. 500,000Additional as result of National Service Law &apos; .. .. . . 500,0002,200,000How these men are now distributed it is impossible to say, but the followingdistribution is probable : Jn depots and in new formations in Germany .. ,. ..       800,000Not yet all called up, but the 1919 class (about 500,000 men) are in process of being called up .. . . .. ..     1,400,000Total        ,. .. .. .-,    2,200,000General Staff, War Office,February 13, 1917.APPENDIX III.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, dated the 10th February, 1917I AM anxious to express my concurrence with the views expressed by the GeneralStaff in their memorandum of the 8th February. I believe that unless drastic steps are taken, there will not be sufficient men to keep our. Army in France up to strength in the Spring, and on this success or failure may easily depend. I agree with theSecretary of State for India in the memorandum circulated by him on the 6th February.I believe that without compulsory powers, the Director of Man-Power, notwithstanding the evidence, he has given of his grasp of the whole subject, and the admirable natureof his proposals, will not be able to secure the necessary men for the colours. In this regard may I say that I contemplate with dismay the proposal arrived at by the cabinet at their meeting on the 5th February, when they instructed the Home Office to prepare a Bill providing for the review by a new authority of the proceedings of the Tribunals.I am confident that any proposal of this kind will give mortal offence to our greatlocal authorities, will tend to delay, not to expedite matters, and indeed I should bevery much surprised if a Bill of this character could be passed through parliament before Easter, in which case it could have no possible effect. I venture respectfully to hope, having been connected with the Tribunals from the beginning, and not havingbeen consulted when this decision was arrived at, that the Cabinet may be willing togive so grave a question further consideration.(Initialled,) W.

Munitions Output and Recruiting.Memorandum by Dr. Addison. *I DESIRE to call the attention of the War Cabinet to the effect upon the outputof essential munitions which is being caused by the operation of their recent decisionswith regard to the calling up of munition workers for military service.The decisions are as follows : January 19, 19171 (g) (i). That, subject to the decisions in paragraphs (a) to (d), the Directorshould proceed, as in Part I of his Report, by releasing for the Army all menof 18 to 22, but scheduling as exempt from military recruiting within those agesmen in those&quot; occupations which are found to be of vital national importance,Le., men employed in the production of steel, in the occupations covered by thetrade card scheme, and in agriculture, mines and quarries, railway shops, transportwork, and shipyards.February 5, 1917.2 (I). The attention of the Director-General of National Service and the WarOffice should be called to the fact that paragraph 1 (g) (i) refers to &quot; occupationscovered by the Trade Card Scheme,&quot; and not to individual holders of the card ;(c.) Paragraph 1 (g) (i) should be read as applying only to men who are fit for general service.2. In pursuance of these decisions, notices to present themselves for medical examination havev been sent not only to semi-skilled and unskilled men, but also toskilled men between the ages of 18 and 23 years who are engaged in the productionand manufacture of brass, copper, aluminium and other important metals, tubes,sheet-iron, wire, springs, bolts and nuts, chains, chemicals, aeroplanes, aeronauticalwoodwork, glass ; also to men engaged in the manufacture of machinery and tools,guns, motor lorries, and in other industries. We have received the most vigorousrepresentations on the subject from large numbers of firms all over the country.3. It therefore appears that a more precise definition of the War Cabinet&apos;decisions is required, for the interpretation which at present is being given to them will not cover a large part of the industries necessary to the production of essentialmunitionsf am, of course, fully desirous of furnishing to the Army in the field from munitions, industries the largest quota of general service men compatible with themaintenance of such an output of munitions as the Army considers essential to its success, but it is my duty to inform the War Cabinet that there is at present a dangerof a serious fall in the output of certain essential munitions under the presentinterpretation of the decisions quoted.4. For instance, it appears that the output of brass may be reduced by an amount which means the loss of 300,000 fuses and 200,000 cartridge cases per week.Again, with regard to copper, it would appear that 8 per cent, of the skilled men engaged in the production of copper may be taken ; tbe resulting loss in output wouldbe proportionately greater than the loss of labour. Amongst other important rawmaterials which may be similarly affected are aluminium, spelter, lead, and antimony.5. The uncertainty which at present prevails may be illustrated by the case of aeroplanes. The production of aircraft is threatened by the possible removal of men engaged on the manufacture of such essential components as aluminium, tubes, highly specialised woodwork, springs, bolts and nuts, dope, wire, castings and stampings, andoptical instruments.6. Again, the Army is relying on our fulfilling a large programme of new gunsand of repair and relining of existing guns, for which latter demands considerableextensions of existing shops have to be carried out. Men in the existing shops andmen engaged on machines for the equipment of new shops are now being called up.The arming of merchant ships will also be affected.   Attached is a letter from a large[1365-64] D
to-firm of gnn manufacturers which illustrates this point.   In this connection I should like to recall an agreement made between my predecessor and the late Secretary ofState for War embodied in the following note : &quot;In anticipation of War Office sanction I have given instructions that everygunmaker in the United Kingdom is to be kept up to maximum capacity tillfurther notice. Additional plant must belaid down for repair. A promise canbe given that we will do our utmost to give guumakers material and labour. E. S. M., 9.11.16.   I entirely approve.-IX LI. O., 9.11.16.&quot;7. Again, large numbers of skilled chemists may be called up from explosivesfactories. The Explosives Department estimate that 15 per cent, of the workschemists are under 23 years of age. The effect of their removal will be a reductionnot only in quantity, but also, it is feared, in quality of explosives. It may be pointedout that we are at the present moment making the greatest possible effort to increasethe output of explosives in this country so as to avoid purchase in America and itstransport to this country. The War Office released 150 chemists from the Army forwork in explosives factories in view of the importance of this work.Part II.8. On the 19th January the War Cabinet decided : &apos; 1 (d.) That 50,000 semi-skilled and unskilled men now engaged in munitions works should be made available for general service by the end ofJanuary, and that the Ministry of Munitions should proceed with the measures already in operation for this purpose.&quot;This decision refers to the general service men aged 18 to 30 inclusive to be released from munitions works under what is known as the Substitution Scheme.Comparatively few men have so far been released under this scheme, partly becausethe machinery since the Army Council Instruction of the 23rd December was issuedhas taken some time to get into operation. The main cause of delay, however, hasbeen slowness in medical examination.9. Up to the 2nd February, according to figures supplied by the EmploymentExchanges, returns covering the names of 376,161 men had been sent to the militaryauthorities. These men were to be medically classified, in order to discover those fit for general service. On that date the number returned as having been medically examined was 41,766, of whom only 12,664 were placed in Class &quot; A.&quot;10. A forcible illustration is furnished by the state of affairs at Barrow. Thereare in this place 12,000 men to be medically examined. A medical board has been engaged there for the last three weeks, and during that period they have examinedonly 1,700 men. At the present rate of progress, the examination of the men at Barrowwill not be concluded until some time during May.11. It is quite impossible for the Ministry to make substantial progress with therelease of the 50,000 men until they are informed which men are to be Class &quot; A,&quot; but,provided a sufficient supply of suitable substitutes is forthcoming, the Ministry see noreason why this system should not give good and more accelerated results.Part III.12. On the 5th February the War Cabinet decided &quot; 2 (a). The men to be released for the Army from munition works under paragraph 1 (g) (i) are additional to the 50,000 men to be released under paragraph 1 (d).&quot;On the basis of the estimate obtained from the War Office as to the percentage ofmen who may be expected to be found fit for general service, and excluding men engaged in those munitions industries which the War Cabinet have already decided to treat as essential, and the men who hold trade cards or who are in occupations coveredby the Trade Card Scheme, it appears that between the ages of 23 and 30 inclusivethere are only 21,000 to 26,000 men available for general service.
The Secretary,Ministry of Munitions of War,Whitehall Place, S.W.Vickers House, Broadway, Westminster,Sir, London, February 10, 1917.We have the honour to refer to the latest Government measure with regard toMan-Power to withdraw men between the ages of 18 and 22 years from all industrieswithout any intention of replacing the labour thus withdrawn.We have closely investigated the results which may be expected to accrue if thisproposition is carried into force, and although the time at our disposal has beenexceedingly short, we are greatly alarmed at the disastrotrs consequences which willensue should men between 18 and 22 years of age be permanently or temporarilywithdrawn without substitution.We have been in close consultation with the whole of our works and several of our most important sub-contractors, and the opinion is absolutely unanimous, that an enormous reduction in output will immediately accrue.This reduction in output will vary, and the following is a short resume of the investigations made at our various works, viz. : Barroio.^ -Reduction of from 30 to 65 per cent. &apos;Sheffield. Will paralyse the whole works.Frith. Will cripple production considerably.Grayford. Paralyse output of mines and Admiralty work of the extremesturgencyBeyer Peacock. Will entirely cripple the output, as men of this age are vital totheir getting out their work.Electric and Ordnance Accessories Company (Limited). Very serious reduction in output will resultWolseley Motors (Limited). Will greatly add to difficulties.From the above you will gather that if the proposal to withdraw the men referredto is put into effect, the result so far as output is concerned will be most disastrous and far reaching, and we beg respectfully to notify the Department that all promises of delivery in connection with contracts which we have now in hand are unreservedlywithdrawn.We have, &amp;c.(For Vickers, Limited),(Signed) V. CAILLARD, Director.o13. Any considerable number of general service men in excess of the 50,000 canonly be obtained from munition works (a.) If the War Office are prepared to accept for general service purposes menover the age of 31; or(fe.) If skilled men under the age of 31 are removed from munition work ; or(c.) If the age of military service is raised above 41 and the War Office areprepared to accept for general service men over that age.C. ADDISON.February 12, 1917.
