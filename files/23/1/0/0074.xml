THE War Cabinet had under consideration a Note by theand France. President of the Board of Trade, dated the 17th February, 1917(Appendix I), setting forth the very grave situation in regard to theprovision of coal for Italy, together with statistics showing thatthere is an aggregate deficit in the requisite import for the six weeks ended the 10th February, amounting to 1,092,337 tons (36 per cent.)in the case of France, and 758,597 tons (59 per cent.) in the case ofItaly (Appendix II).The Shipping Controller stated that, in consequence of thewithdrawal of British battleships from the Mediterranean, it mightbe possible to find shipping for 50,000 to 60,000 tons of coal diverted from the British Mediterranean Fleet. He further stated that sir Alfred Watson was completing a further statistical memorandumon the subject of shipping, which would probably indicate the need of still further restrictions in imports over and above the 500,000 tonsa month already agreed upon.The War Cabinet instructed the Shipping Controller to workout a complete scheme for the permanent supply of Italyand France with coal.
2. The War Cabinet decided that In any case, apart from the imperative need for sending coal toItaly and France, it was desirable that imports should befurther restricted over and above the 500,000 tons a month,in order to provide a margin, and they inclined to the viewthat this additional restriction could best be made intimber.They invited Lord Curzon to reassemble his Committee on theRestriction of Imports, in order to consider Sir AlfredWatson&apos;s memorandum and the question of making afurther reduction in the importation of timber by 100,000tons a month, in addition to the 200,000 tons a monthalready decided upon.(Initialled) D.

It was suggested that this tonnage should beprovided: (a) 75,000 tons by the British Admiralty, (o) 125,000 tons by neutral tonnage, (c) 100,000 tons by the withdrawal of either neutral or British tonnage from french service.Up to date the Admiralty have arranged for 75,000 tons to be provided by them,hut only 57,000 tons of neutral tonnage has been chartered. So far no reply has beenreceived from the. French Government to the Foreign Office telegram of the2nd February, asking them to supply their quota. The Foreign Office have beenasked to point out the seriousness of the situation and to press for an immediate reply.The latest weekly returns show that only 49,000 tons of coal arrived in Italyduring the first week of February. This amount, following upon a succession of weekly shortages, and with no prospect of improving the situation in the near future,has rendered the position of Italy exceedingly precarious.The representative of the Italian Government on the Commission Internationalede Ravitaillement has stated that unless Italy received immediate assistance, not onlythe offensive but also the defensive will be paralysed.The possibility of conveying coal overland through certain French Atlantic portsis being carefully considered, but, owing to the difficulty in the provision of trucks, itdoes not appear likely that more than 2,000 tons a day could be sent by this means.In the meanwhile it is suggested that unless the French Government offer toassist within the course of the next few days, the Admiralty should consider therequisition of British tonnage in French employ for the temporary relief of the Italiansituation.It is imperative that no time should be lost in giving Italy the assistance sherequires.February 17, 1917.
