WITH reference to Minutes 6 and 7 of the meeting held on29th December (War Cabinet, 22), the Director of MilitaryOperations reported that the General Staff had received definite information that-(a.) The movement of enemy troops on the Belgian coastconsisted of the substitution, at Bruges, of the 2ndGerman Guard Reserve Division for the 38th Division.The former division had been severely handled on the... Somme, and had been probably brought to Bruges for rest.It was unlikely that a division fresh from training, with alladvantages for a specific purpose, would be sent to theSouth, if a move in the North had been contemplated.(b.) From reports received, no concentration had taken place at Antwerp.2. With reference to Minute 4 of the Meeting held on the29th December (War Cabinet 22), the Director of Military Operationsgave the. additional information, which is reproduced in Appendix I.
Fighting Strengthand Total Strength.3. The Director of Military Operations undertook to furnish theWar Cabinet with a comparative statement of the fighting strengthand the total strength of the British, French, and German Armieson the Western front.Greece.4. With reference to Conclusion 2 of the Anglo-french conference of the 26th-28th December, the Director of MilitaryOperations reported that the evacuation was being carried outsatisfactorily, that all the artillery had left Thessaly, and that the units being withdrawn to the Morea were apj)arently at a reasonablestrength.5. If circumstances should bring about a state of war with greece, the Director of Military Operations did not consider that the nucleus of regular troops, together with such armed reservists as would be left in Thessaly and Northern Greece, would form aserious offensive force, but the.y might give considerable trouble ifwe attempted to invade Thessaly, and would also constitute a threat to the Allies&apos; communications with Mod astir.It was decided that the Chief of the Imperial General staff should furnish the War Cabinet with an appreciation ofthe military aspect of hostilities with Greece.The SecondUltimatum.6. With reference to the decision to proceed with the secondultimatum to Greece, even if Italy did not join in (Conclusion 3,Anglo-French Conference, the 26th-28th December), Lord R. Cecilmentioned that a subsequent telegram (No. 2146) from Sir F. Elliotstated that Italy would be satisfied if some w^ords were added tothe effect that the Allies would not favour a Venizelist movement inOld Greece.   It was felt that such an assurance could not well beEuboea.suggestion by General Sarrail that weAVith. reference to should demand the evacuation of Eubcea byRoyalist troops (see telegElliot), and laising certainregard to theGreektelegram No.  2147 from Sir F.considerations withmagnesite mines in this island, the WarCabinet decided that the question should be raised atthe forthcoming Anglo-French-Italian Conference.Greek treasury bills.8. The War Cabinet decided that the question of renewing anagreement for discounting Greek Treasury bills, referredto in Treasury letter to the Foreign Office No. 34568,dated the 22nd December, 1916 (Foreign Office fileNo. 260138), should be left for arrangement between theTreasury and the Foreign Office.Proposed     Anglo-French - ItalianConference.Naval and ShippingEepresentatives.Military Bepresen-tatives.9.The War Cabinet decided that Sir C. Thursby, the Vice-Admiral Commanding in the Eastern Mediterranean,should attend the forthcoming Anglo-French-ItalianConference. The War Cabinet were informed thatMr. Royden, of the Shipping Control Committee, had.been deputed to accompany the Mission.10. The War Gabinet decided that it was unnecessary forGeneral Sir Douglas Haig to attend the Conference inaddition to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff andGeneral Milne.
Proposed     Anglo- -French - ItalianConference.Powers of the delegates.Pities forPtoumania.Attended in connec-tion with Minutes12, 13,and 16:Dr.    C.M.D.,14,   15,Addison,M.P.,Minister of Muni-tions.Attended in connee-tionwith Minutes12, 13, and 14:The Earl Derby,Secretary of Statefor War.Major-General W.T. Furse, Master-General of the ordnance.Major-General C.E. Callwell, WarOffice.11. It was agreed that the Members of the War Cabinet (thePrime Minister and Lord Milner). who attended the Conference,went with full powers to conclude any arrangement that they mightarrive at.12. With reference to Minute 3 of the meeting held on the12th December (War Cabinet, 3), and Minute 9 of the meeting heldon the 18th December (War Cabinet, 10) with regard to the promisegiven to furnish 100,000 rifles to Roumania, the Prime Ministermentioned that he had seen the Roumanian Minister, who statedthat Roumania still had 450,000 men under arms, and hoped to beable to raise an army of 800,000, or even 1,000,000 men. the urgent needs of the six Territorial Divisions in India and Egypt forre-armament with new pattern rifles were pointed out by theSecretary of State for War, and on behalf of the Secretary of Statefor India.13. It was suggested that as the undertaking given to the roumanians was by the French and British Governments, and asthe French had since increased their share, that might relieve theBritish Government of its undertaking.It was decided that the War Office should communicate withGeneral Lyautey to ascertain the actual position in thisrespect, and should also endeavour to secure from the roumanians definite information as to their present arma-ment and total requirements, bringing the situation up todate since the Chantilly Conference.14. The inefficiency of the present Roumanian representation inthis country, and the possibility of finding a suitable British repre-sentative for Roumania, as regards munitions, was discussed.Proposed diversion to Merchant ships of a Proportion of.Future Supplies of .A nti- aircraft guns.15. With reference to Minute 11 of the Meeting held on the29th December (War Cabinet, 22), Lord Curzon reported that theFirst Sea Lord, having ascertained that the 3-inch 20-cwt. anti-aircraft guns were suitable for the armament of merchant ships, theAir Board had investigated the question of the diversion to merchantshipping of future supplies of these guns under manufacture for the anti-aircraft service.After a very careful review of the whole question of anti-aircraft defence, and the respective parts played therein by artillery andaeroplanes, the Air Board, Lord Curzon reported, had come to theconclusion that for the present artillery anti-aircraft defence was of less urgency than the arming of our merchant ships. They there-fore recommended that, subject to the retention of a small reserve(say 15 or 20 guns) for the defence of vulnerable points of greatimportance, the whole of the fiiture supplies of 3-inch 20-cwt. anti-aircraft guns, amounting to 190, should be handed over to theAdmiralty for arming merchant ships.The War Cabinet approved the recommendation of theChairman of the Air Board.Norwegian Terri-torial Waters.16. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumby the Admiralty covering a proposal by the Commander-in-chiefof the Grand Fleet that naval action should be taken in the north sea involving an infringement of the territorial rights of Norway(Appendix II).
The Accident in 17. With reference to Minute 5 of the Meeting held on theBoulogne Harbour. 29th December, the First Sea Lord reported that, from the latest information received from the salvage officials, the case appearedmore favourable, and that there was a possibility that the entrancechannel to Boulogne Harbour might be clear by the middleof January.Reprisals for Qut-rages.Attended for thissubject:Lord Newton,Foreign Office.Lieut.-general   sir h. E. Belfield,Director ofPrisoners of War.18. With reference to the discussion on the 13th December(War Cabinet, 6) on the case of Captain Blaikie, theWar Cabinet decided that the policy then agreed to,with special reference to that case, should be adopted asa general policy, namely, that in the event of the execu-tion of captains or crews of merchant-ships reprisalswould be undertaken. The Foreign Office should intimate this to the American Ambassador (Appendix III).(Initialled) D. LI. G.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,December 30, 191b&apos;.A discussion took place as to whether the escape of Germanraiders from the North Sea, by utilising Norwegian territorial waters, would justify a breach of International Law by our visitingthose waters for search purposes, and, if it did, what would bethe effect on Norway and, consequentially, on Sweden. Asregards the former, the result that might be expected would be the closing of traffic through Sweden to Russia, and the cessation ofcertain supplies for which we are dependent on Norway. TheMinister of Munitions informed the War Cabinet of the effect whichthis would have on the output of munitions. The supply of ore from Sweden woidd also be shut off.In addition to these disadvantages, considerable doubt was expressed as to whether any infringement of Norwegian territorial rights by the navy could ensure that German ships could be stoppedfrom escaping.The War Cabinet were of opinion that it was desirable thatthey should have more definite information as to what had occurred to  give the Commander-in-chief grounds for the proposal, and if itwas possible to prevent a recurrence.The War Cabinet decided that the First Lord should discussthe question with the Commander-in-chief at an early opportunity, in order to consult him as to the grounds onwhich he had founded his proposal, and the measureswhich he would propose to prevent the escape of a raider.
Relative Lengths of Front on the Western Front.(Note by the General Staff.)1. British front, Boesinghe (inclusive) to Bouchavesnes (exclusive), 90 miles.672 British battalions, i e., 7*5 battalions per mile.472 German battalions, i.e., 5&apos;2 battalions per mile.2. French front, Bouchavesnes (inclusive) to the Moselle, 230 miles.1,215 French battalions, i.e., 5&quot;3 battalions per mile.643 German battalions, i.e., 2&apos;8 battalions per mile.Note. The above figures represent all British divisions, whether in line or in reserve; all French divisions on the Bouchavesnes-Moselle sector, whether in line orin reserve ; and all German divisions on the two sectors, whether in line or in reserve.The comparative strengths are : British to Germans, 1*4 to 1.French to Germans, 1*9 to 1.APPENDIX II.Situation in the North Sea: Control over Norwegian Territorial Waters.(Extracts from letters received from the Commander-in-Chief, Grand Fleet.)THE Commander-in-Chief, Grand Fleet, has, in a letter dated the 15th December,represented that it is urgently necessary to deal with the situation in the North Sea by measures which infringe the territorial rights of Norway.The following extracts from the letter sufficiently indicate his view: &quot; I am clearly of the opinion that no dispositions which are at present opento me can in any way ensure even a favourable chance of intercepting enemy vessels trying to make their way to the Atlantic, or of interfering with the contraband traffic which at present flourishes in the Norwegian leads.* * * * * *&quot; I beg, therefore, to urge that we should exercise control over norwegian territorial waters, visiting and searching vessels, and preventing the practicewhereby enemy vessels and neutral vessels carrying Contraband have hitherto been permitted to pass up and down freely and without fear of molestation. Inthis manner we shall invest the enemy more closely, render more difficult to him the operation of passing out raiders to prey upon the trade routes, whilst a veryconsiderable diminution in the export of highly useful war commodities to theenemy will be effected.******&quot; If it be represented that the result of such action may be to throw Norwayinto war, I would point out that, even with Norway as an enemy, the situation would permit of the more effective use of our naval power, whilst with Norway asan Ally the general strategic position would be immensely relieved.&quot;So far as naval considerations alone are concerned, the Board is in accord with sir D- Beatty&apos;s proposals. The difficulty of preventing the escape of raiders disguisedas neutral merchant vessels is immensely increased by the use of Norwegian territorial waters by such vessels. Moreover, it is felt that it is inconsistent that the waters of a neutral State such as Norway, which has been so ruthlessly treated by Germany,should be used &quot;by German vessels to secure immunity from attack. Norway beingtoo weak or timid to close those waters herself, His Majesty&apos;s Government might wellhold that they are morally justified in doing so.
On the other hand, the Board is naturally reluctant to advocate a departure fromthe principles hitherto adhered to by the Allied Powers of respect for neutral rightsso long as neutral Governments observe their obligations of neutrality.The most important question at issue is, however, whether such a step could betaken without seriously damaging our own interests. Even assuming that oue independence on Norway for necessary supplies is not so great but that we could riskdriving her into antagonism to the Allies, the probably bad effect on other neutrals,and the policy which they might adopt in this connection particularly Sweden andthe United States is a matter for grave consideration. The Board of the Admiralty,so far as it is conversant with the situation, believes that the dependence of the Allieson the good-will of neutrals is such as to render impracticable a policy such as isadvocated by the Commander-in-Chief, Grand Fleet, however desirable it is from thenaval point of view.The matter appears to be one for the consideration of the War Cabinet.A appendix III.Detention by the Enemy of Masters of British Merchant Ships.(Correspondence between Lamport and Holt (Limited), Admiralty, and Prisonersof War Department.)I.Sir Maurice Hankey,SIR. EDWARD CARSON asks me to send you the attached copies of correspon-dence that has passed between the Admiralty and the shipping firm of Messrs. Lamportand Holt (Limited), also a copy of a letter that the Admiralty has sent to the Secretaryof the Prisoners of War Department suggesting that endeavours should be made to conclude an agreement with the German Government similar to that adopted by theFrench and German Governments, whereby the execution of all judicial sentencespronounced against their respective prisoners of war is to be postponed until after thetermination of the war.Sir Edward Carson suggests -that some general policy should be laid down by theWar Cabinet. Several captains of merchant ships sunk by enemy submarines arebeing kept as prisoners by the Germans, and it looks as if the Germans intend to makea practice of it.(Signed) J. MASTERTON SMITH.December 27, 1916.II.Sir, 36, Lime Street, E.G., December 19, 1916.We yesterday brought to the notice of the Admiralty Transport Department thatour steamer &quot; Pascal,&quot; which for some time past has been in Government service, wasyesterday sunk by an enemy submarine in the neighbourhood of the Channel Islands,and that the survivors, officers and crew, had landed at Alderney, with the exceptionof the- captain, Hugh Layton, who, we are advised, has been detained by the Germansas a prisoner. We therefore venture at once to bespeak on behalf of this officer theimmediate consideration of his unfortunate position which, it appears to us, is the sameas that in which Captain Blaikie of the &quot; Caledonia &quot; is placed, which, according togeneral report, is receiving the attention of His Majesty&apos;s Government.^v^6 urB &amp;c* A&apos; ARTHUR COOK, Managing Director,Lamport and Holt (Limited).The Secretary, Admiralty.

GRAHAM GREENE.The Managing Director,Messrs. Lamport and Holt (Limited).IV.Sir, Admiralty, Whitehall, December 18, 1916.With reference to the recent correspondence respecting Captain Blaikie of the&quot;Caledonia,&quot; I am commanded&apos;by my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to acquaint you, for the information of the Controller of the Prisoners of war department, that, in their opinion, it is of great importance that steps should immediately be taken with a view to safeguarding more effectually the lives of Britishsubjects who may fall into the hands of tbe enemy.With this object my Lords would urge that an endeavour. should be made to conclude with the German Government an agreement similar to the agreement whichwas stated in the letter from the Foreign Office of the 15th September last,No. 181169/1916 P.18, to have been adopted by the French and German Governments,whereby the execution of all judicial sentences pronounced against their respectiveprisoners of war is to be postponed until after the termination of the war.It is in their Lordships&apos; opinion essential that specific provision should be made &apos;that the agreement shall include officers in the Mercantile Marine who may becaptured in circumstances similar   to  those in which  Captain Blaikie was taken prisoner.A copy of this letter is being sent to the War Office.I am, &amp;c.W. GRAHAM GREENE.The Secretary,Prisoners of War Department,Downing Street, S.W.printed at the foreign office by c. e. harrison.-3/1/1917.
