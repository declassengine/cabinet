Amery, M.P., Assistant Secretary.Alien Princes De-privation of TitlesBill.Attended in connec-tion with minutes, 2, 3, 4, and 5 :Lord Robert Cecil,Foreign Office.The Americanpeace overtures.1. The War Cabinet decided that the question of the policy tobe adopted in regard to the Alien Princes Deprivation ofTitles Bill must be discussed before Parliament re-assembles. The Chancellor of the Exchequer undertook to place the War Cabinet in possession of the facts, ofthe situation.2. The War Cabinet had before them the following documents relating to the American peace overtures : (a.) A memorandum by Lord Robert Cecil, dated 22ndDecember, 1916, on the subject of proposed action inregard tothe American note (Appendix I).(b.) A draft reply, prepared by M. Briand, to the peace over-tures of the President of the United States of America(Appendix II). -The War Cabinet first considered the general lines of the replyto be made to the American Note, viz., whether it should be on theline of the first alternative suggested by Lord Robert Cecil andM. Briand&apos;s reply, in effect an evasive reply; or the second alternative, which proposed that we should explain in general terms the objects for which we are fighting, including insistence on a final settlement of the Turkish question.As a preliminary step it was decided that Lord Robert Cecilshould prepare, for the consideration of the War Cabinet,a draft reply on the lines of his second alternative.
The War Cabinet were informed that Mr. Balfour was alsopreparing a draft reply.Lord Robert Cecil undertook to telegraph to Russia in the sense that the Government was considering the two alternatives proposed,and were inclined towards the second.The French draft reply to theGerman PeaceOvertures.3. The War Cabinet had under consideration a draft reply,prepared by M. briand, to the German peace overtures.It was decided that the draft should be taken as a basis for the reply, and that, in the first instance, the Foreign office should suggest amendments.Greece.4. With reference to a telegram from the British Minister at athens, dated the 21st December, 191.6 (Appendix 111), the WarCabinet approved the guarantees to the Greek Government againsta Venizelist invasion, suggested in the telegram.British Eepre- 5. The War Cabinet discussed the desirability of attaching asentetive with British Political Officer tp General Sarrail.   One of the obstacleswhich presented itself to this proposal was the difficulty of preventing the other Allies from attaching their Political Officers,which would cause great confusion.M. Venizelos.The War Cabinet approved an alternative proposal that a first-rate diplomatist should be accredited to M. Venizelos,who is known to be dissatisfied with the present lack ofintercommunication with the British Government. .Consultation withthe Dominions andIndia (ImperialConference).. Attended tor thissubject:&apos;Mr. Austen Cham-berlain, M.P.,Secretary of Statefor India.Sir G. V. Fiddes,Permanent Un-der-Secretary ofState for theColonies.Did not attend forthis subject :General Sir W.Robertson, Chiefof the ImperialGeneral Staff.6. With reference to Minute 7 of 22nd December (War Cabinet15), the War Cabinet further discussed the draft telegram to theDominions, in view of an amendment suggested by the Secretary ofState for the Colonies in the original draft. The effect of this amendment was to invite the Dominions to participation in a specialWar Conference, which was to be additional to, and separate from,the discussions at the War Cabinet.(See words enclosed in square brackets in Appendix I of minutes of War Cabinet 15.)It was pointed out that the effect of this amendment was contrary to the decision of the Cabinet, which was that partici-pation in the discussions of the War Cabinet was to supersede theidea of a Confeience on former lines.Sir G. V. Fiddes, who attended in the absence of the Secretaryof State for the Colonies, said there must have been a seriousmisunderstanding. The Secretary of State for the Colonies hadcertainly understood that an Imperial Conference was contemplated,and that this had been promised by the Prime Minister on the19th December. The Dominions might want to raise other topicsbesides those suitable to meetings of the War Cabinet. There wasaleo the status of other Dominion Ministers, besides Prime Ministers,or their substitutes, who might wish to attend. It was for these reasons that the Secretary of State had suggested the amendment, inhis letter to the Prime Minister of 22nd December, and he had beengiven to understand that the amendment was approved.On these points it was agreed (I.) That the promise of an ImperiallConference was morethan covered by participation in the War Cabinet,which would be preferred by the Dominions;
(2.) That other topics, if raised by the Dominions, might bediscussed outside the Cabinet, but that it was preferable not to invite such discussion, but to confine the invitation to questions of Urgency during the war or arisingimmediately out of its termination ;(3.) That other Dominion Ministers could come in as assessors,but that, in any case, it should be left to the dominions to raise&apos; that point. The draft, as finally approved, is printed in Appendix IV.7. The War Cabinet also approved the telegram by theSecretary of State for India printed in Appendix V.The War Cabinet considered that, having regard to the greatservices of India during the war, and the character of the assistantsto the Secretary of State for India suggested in his Secret telegram to the Viceroy (Appendix VI), there could not possibly be anytenable objection on the part of the Dominions to the inclusion of adistinguished Native of India among the assistants. It was,however, agreed that it might be convenient to postpone thepublication of the names of the representatives for the present.(Initialled)   D. LI. G.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,December 23, 191(5.APPENDIX I.Memorandum by Lord Robert Cecil.Proposed Action in regard to American Note.Two lines of reply seem open to us in dealing with the American note. We mayeither inform the Americans that we are not prepared to make any statement as to terms of peace at present ; that Germany was the aggressor, and it is for her, if she wishes to do so, to make any proposals in the direction of peace ; and that we cannot admit inany way the doctrine that the aims of the belligerents are identical or similar, or thatat this stage any good purpose would be served by admitting the intervention of a neutral Government.The advantage of a reply on some such lines as that would be.that it would emphasise the impossibility of considering any peace terms at present, and that itwould put heart into the most determined parts of the Allied populations, and that itmight stifle the protests of those who are inclined to look about for some means of putting a stop to the war.On the other hand it has considerable disadvantages. It would certainlystrengthen the position of the military party in Germany they would be able to. saywith some plausibility that nothing remained for any decent German but to fight until he was killed. Then its effect on the Allied pacifists is at least doubtful; it might be justthe reverse of what we wish ; it might induce them to say that there is no hope for peaceunder the existing leadership, and the only thing is to insist on an immediate cessation ofwar. They might argue that if our terms were at all moderate or defensible we shouldhave been only too glad to state them, and the fact that we refuse to state them showsthat we know them to be utterly inacceptable to all moderate men. In this countryparticularly any irreconcilable attitude is apt to be unpopular. Englishmen do notmind doing violent things, but they like to persuade themselves that they are all thewhile models of moderation. I confess that I should be a little afraid of the effectof the above reply upon English public opinion. Its effect on neutral opinion couldscarcely be anything but bad. There would no doubt be a certain number of people in the Eastern States of America who would applaud anything which had theappearance of strength, but unfortunately the East of America is of very little political importance at present. The President was elected by the votes of the West and South,and it is scarcely too much to say that any action warmly applauded by Easterncapitalists is onthat very account likely to be disapproved by Western opinion.   The
President himself would evidently be much disappointed, to put it mildly, and though,on reflection, I think it very unlikely that he would proceed to directly hostilemeasures against the Allies, undoubtedly he would look about for means to make them,feel his displeasure. He would very&apos;possibly stir up again the agitation about theblacklist; he might go so far as to exercise the powers given to him in the last session of Congress to hold up ships which refuse black-listed cargo. The mailsquestion would be, of course, raised again, and he might then go so far as to enter intocorrespondence with the Swedish and perhaps the Dutch Governments with the object of enforcing their views as to the illegality of our blockade operations. A7ery littleencouragement from America would make the Governments of- Sweden and Hollandimpossible to deal with. When an atmosphere of irritation had been created by methods of this description, it is not at all impossible that, the President would feelhimself strong enough to proceed to much more drastic measures.The other line which we might take would be to protest in the strongest wayagainst the American assumption that both sides were fighting for the same objects ;and state again with vigour and directness the origin and purpose of the war aswe understand it. There might then be a reference to the American claim tohumanity, with an expression of regret that it had so far produced little active results,enumerating the various occasions in which they had failed to interfere to checkor punish German outrages or atrocities. We should then go on to say that thegeneral objects of the war, as far as we were concerned, had often been stated, andwere quite well known; that we had no objection to restate them in a somewhat fullerform. We should then reiterate that we required restoration and repatriation forBelgium and Serbia, the evacuation of all occupied territory of the Allies in France,Russia, and Roumania. Beyond that wTe should say that we looked for some territorialsettlement that would have a chance of permanence ; that it would and must be basedon principles acceptable to human feeling, such as nationality and securitjr. On these grounds France would be entitled, in our view, to such a rearrangement of her eastern. frontier as would render impossible such an unprovoked attack as she had beenthe victim of in the present war, and also should have given back to her thoseprovinces which were ethnologically French. In Russia Ave should look for the forma-tion of a real Poland, including all Poles, wdiether before the war Germans, Russians,or Austrians, autonomous in government, but under the protection of the RussianEmperor.The same principles would be applied to Italy, including such alterations of territory as would give to her security in the Adriatic. As to the South-East of Europe,which has long been the breeding-place of European disturbances, a settlement on sound national lines is, in our view, essential; the details of it cannot be laid down atpresent, but they would include the liberation of Slav peoples from German domination.Not less important is the final settlement of the Turkish question, and when we came to this point I think we should speak very strongly. We should insist that Turkishaction during the present Avar had made it finally impossible for her to be allowed tohave under her control any population which was of other than Ottoman nationality, orallow her to remain as one of the European Powers. She must in fact be relegated toAsia. We should then explain that in cur view, both on commercial and political grounds, it was essential that Russia should have control of Constantinople, with proper safeguards for free navigation of the Bosphorus and Dardanelles.Further than this we should explain that we could not go. To ask us to lay downterms of peace in detail would be, in the Prime Ministers phrase, to ask us to put ourheads into a noose The general principles we had explained in sufficient detail tomake them quite clear. But the manner in which these principles should in each casebo worked out and the subsidiary provisions necessary for reparation and indemnityAve could not discuss until the time for peace carne. And then we could add any necessary peroration as to our determination to continue the Avar.Without expressing any final opinion as to the desirability of either of the twocourses Avhich I have sketched, I cannot help feeling that the second Avould give us anopportunity of explaining vigorously and effectively to the Americans and other neutral nations, as well as to our own people and the Germans, that our aims are really based on justice and liberty, aud that when we use those phrases we have some-thing definite in mind beyond mere verbiage. It would also enable us to put on a proper footing the Constantinople question, which will assuredly be one of our great difficulties in the near future.As to the league of nations for the prevention of war, our course is.tolerably clear,whatever line we adopt on other questions.   We should express the utmost sympathy
with the proposal, and should ask what was exactly meant by the promised support ofthe United States. Did it mean that the United States Government had the will andthe power to give armed support to the decisions of any such league ? And we should refer to Senator Stone&apos;s recent speech on* the subject. We should further enquire whether the province of the league was to extend to the American continent, andprofess our readiness to enter more fully into the subject when we had been satisfiedon these points.(Initialled) R. C.December 22, 1916.APPENDIX II.Draft Reply prepared by M. Briand to American Peace Overtures.LES Gouvernements allies ont recu la note qui leur a ete remise le 19 decembrepar le Gouvernement des Etats-Unis.Ils l&apos;ont etudiee avec le soin que leur commandaient a la fois 1&apos;exact sentimentqu&apos;ils ont de la gravite de 1&apos;heure et la sincere amitie qui les&apos; attache au peupleamericaiu.D&apos;une maniere generale, ils tiennent a, declarer qu&apos;ils rendent pleine justice a.1&apos;elevation des sentiments dont s&apos;inspire la note americaine et s&apos;associent de tous leursvoeux au projet de creation d&apos;une ligue des nations pour assurer la paix et la justice atravers le monde.    tMais cette grande heure n&apos;a pas sonne ; qu&apos;auparavant s&apos;impose la necessity de reglerles fins de la presente guerre. Ayant eu a endurer eux-memes tous les sacrifices et lesdouleurs qu&apos;entraine a sa suite unr conflit aussi terrible, ils eprouvent un desir aussiprofond que le Gouvernement des Etats-Unis de voir se terminer le plus tot possible laguerre dont les Empires centraux sont responsables et qui inflige a 1&apos;humanite de sicruelles souffranees.Mais ils ne croient pas, quant a eux, qu&apos;il soit possible cles aujourd&apos;hui de realiserune paix qui nous assure les reparations, les restitutions et les garanties auxquelles1&apos;agression clont nous avons ete 1&apos;objet nous donne droit.Les Allies prennent acte, tout d&apos;abord, de la declaration faite que la communicationamericaine &quot; n&apos;est associee d&apos;aucLine maniere dans son origine avec celle des Puissancescentrales &quot; transmise le IS decembre par le Gouvernement de 1&apos;Union. Ils ne doutaientpas, au surplus, de la resolution de ce Gouvernement d&apos;eviter jusqu&apos;a 1&apos;apparence d&apos;unappui meme moral accorde aux auteurs responsables de la guerre.Ils estiment que la note qu&apos;ils remettent aujourd&apos;hui meme aux Etats-Unis, en -reponse a la note allemande, repond a la premiere question posee par le PresidentWoodrow Wilson et constitue, suivant ses propres expressions, &quot; une declarationpublique de leurs vues quant aux conditions auxquelles la guerre pourrait etreterminee &quot; et quant aux garanties &quot; contre le retour ou le dechainement dun conflitsimilaire dans 1&apos;avenir.&quot; &apos;Sur le second point traite par le President, les Gouvernements allies ont, aucontraire, le devoir de formuler dans la forme la plus amicale, mais la plus nette, uneexpresse et energique protestation contre l&apos;assiinilation etablie entre les deux groupesde belligerants.Le President ecrit que &quot; les objets que les hommes d&apos;Etat des pays belligerantsdes deux groupes ont eu en vue dans cette guerre sont virtuellement les memes,conformement aux declarations faites en termes generaux a leurs propres peuples et aumonde,&quot; c&apos;est a savoir &quot;rendre les droits et privileges des peuples faibles aussi assurescpntre les agressions ou denis de justice dans 1&apos;avenir que les droits et privileges des etats forts et puissants maintenant en guerre.&quot;Les Gouvernements allies estiment que cette assimilation, si elle peut correspondrea des declarations publiques, n&apos;en est pas moins en opposition directe avec l&apos;eviclenceant en ce qui concerne les responsabilites du passe qu&apos;en ce qui concerne les garantiesde 1&apos;aveni&apos;r, et, considerant que 1&apos;AUemagne a prouve aussi bien par la declaration de guerre et la violation de la neutralite du Luxembourg et de la Belgique le jour memede cette declaration que par la facon dont elle l&apos;a conduite, son mepris systematicpuedes principes ci-dessus enonces, fondant leur jugement non sur les discours, mais surles actes, ils refusent d&apos;accorder aucune confiance a une parole tant de fois violee. .
Les manifestations emouvantes qui, notamment sur le territoire de 1&apos;Union, seproduisent en ce moment meme contre la derniere violation du droit des gens commisepar les Allemands en Belgique venant s&apos;ajouter a celle clout les populations francaisesdes cerritoires envaliis ont ete victimes demontrent que cette opinion, basee sur lesi&apos;aiti5, est partagee par 1&apos;immense majorite des neutres.En consequence, se referant a la reponse faite par eux a .1a note allemande, les gouvernements allies en renouvellcnt la conclusion et affirment une fois de plus queles principes de droit et de justice enonces par le President et specialement la garantiedes petites nationalites et de la liberte economique menacee par une nation qui ventorganiser la production de 1&apos;Europe entiere autour cle son industrie et pour sonIndustrie ne peuvent resulter que de la maniere dont la guerre se terminera et netrouveront de garanties durables que dans une Europe soustraite aux convoitisesbrutales du militarisme prussien. -Les Allies seraient beureux a ce moment de repondre au genereux appel duPresident Wilson.Le 23 decembre, 1916. &apos;APPENDIX III.Telegram from Sir F. Elliot, Athens, December 21, 1916.Your telegram No. 1546 of 20tli December.Guarantee against Venizelist invasion was inserted in draft forwarded in. my telegram No. 20 [? 58] of 17th December, firstly, because Italian Minister has positiveinstructions not to take part unless something of the kind is inserted. He proposed amore general guarantee, but, foreseeing objection which you had raised, 1 obtainedunanimous adhesion to text forwarded, which, I hope, meets the case.I consider revolution at Athens out of the question, lioyalists are completelymasters of the situation.   Local rising in Thessaly is possible but not probable.I will submit points 4 and 5 to my colleagues this afternoon, but it is unfortunate that they were not included in first ultimatum.APPENDIX IV.Proposed Amended Telegram to Self-governing Dominions.   .I wish to explain that what His Majesty&apos;s Government contemplate is not asession of the ordinary Imperial Conference, but a special War Conference of theEmpire. They therefore invite your Prime Minister to attend a series of special and continuous meetings of the War Cabinet in order to consider urgent questions affecting the prosecution of the war, the possible conditions on which, in agreementwith our Allies, we could assent to its termination, and the problems which will thenimmediately arise. For the purpose of these meetings, your Prime Minister would bea member of the WVr Cabinet.In view of the extreme urgency of the subjects of discussion, as well as of theirsupreme importance, it is hoped that your Prime Minister may find it possible, inspite of the serious inconvenience involved, to attend at an early date, not later thanthe end of February. While His Maje.sty&apos;s Government earnestly desire the presenceof your Prime Minister himself, they hope that if he sees insuperable difficulty he willcarefully consider the question of nominating a substitute, as they would regard it asa serious misfortune if any Dominion were left unrepresented.
Telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy, dated December 24, 1916. -(Private.)With reference to announcement made by Prime Minister in House of Commonslast Tuesday, 1 have to explain that what His Majesty&apos;s Government contemplate is nota session of the ordinary Imperial Conference but a special War Conference of theEmpire. They are therefore inviting the Prime Ministers of the Dominions to attend a series of special and continuous sittings of the War Cabinet in order to considerurgent questions affecting the prosecution of the war, the possible conditions on which, inagreement with our Allies, we could assent to its termination, and the problems whichwill then immediately arise. For the purpose of these meetings the Prime ministers will be members of the War Cabinet.His Majesty&apos;s Government have invited the Secretary of State for&apos;India to repre-sent India at these sittings of the War Cabinet, of which for that purpose I shall be amember. I desire the.assistance of two gentlemen specially selected for the purpose in consultation with you, as foreshadowed in Lord Hardinge&apos;s speech in the LegislativeCouncil on the 22nd September, 1915.It is hoped that the meetings may take place not later than the end of February.APPENDIX VI.Telegram from Secretary of State for India to Viceroy, December 23, 1916.(Private and Personal.)My private telegram of to-morrow regarding Imperial Conference should be madeofficial at once and should be published on Wednesday morning. Until then it shouldbe treated as very secret.I shall be glad to receive early intimation of your views as to choice of therepresentatives to assist me. It is important that they should be men of weight andsound judgment and absolutely trustworthy, as 1 wish to take them, whenever possible, to the sessions of War Cabinet, where most secret matters will bediscussed, and to invite them on occasion to speak for India. It is not necessary that either should be an Indian, and Dominions would doubtless prefer that both shouldbe Englishmen, but you will probably feel that it is highly desirable that I shouldselect one Indian.printed at the foreign office by c   k. harrison.-1/1/1917.i
