D. Swtnton, D.S.O., R.E., Assistant Secretary.Captain Clement- Jones, Assistant Secretary.The Loss of a transport in theMediterranean.Admiralty powers over merchant service.I. The First Sea Lord, in referring to the sinking of thetransport &quot;Ivernia&quot; in the Mediterranean, informed the WarCabinet that the captain had directly disobeyed orders issued bythe French Commander-in-Chief, by traversing a dangerous channelduring daylight, when he should, by his orders, have done so by night. The First Sea Lord further explained that the admiralty had no powers of punishing masters of merchant vessels who didnot carry out the official instructions issued for their guidance.The War Cabinet decided that: The Admiralty and the Board of Trade should report what steps had been taken to give the Admiralty the necessary powers to enforce compliance with the regulations issuedby them, on the part of officers of the mercantile marine.Reprisals forOutrages.2. The War Cabinet had under consideration a letter from theDirector of Prisoners of War (Appendix I), referring to Minute 18of the Meeting of the War Cabipet of the 30th December, 1916(War Cabinet, 23).After some discussion as to the necessity for, and difficulty of,
putting into force Sir A. BelfielcPs suggestion, the War Cabi nedecided that Minute 18 of the Meeting of the War Cabinet of the 30thDecember, 1916, was an expression of a general principle,and should be adhered to, and that the threat of reprisalsshould not be extended to cover more than the death penalty when carried out by the Germans.The Shortage ofMerchant Shipping(Horses).3. The War Cabinet had under consideration a letter from theCommander-in-Chief, British Armies in France (Appendix II),conveying his considered views as to the possibility of moving a portion of the British cavalry in France to an area where suppliesof forage could be obtained locally, as has been proposed by him atthe Meeting of the War Committee held on the 23rd November, 1916(Paper, War Committee-91). In the circumstances which had beenbrought to his knowledge he had decided to retain the cavalry inin the British zone.The War Cabinet approved this decision.Artillery for Russia.4. In reference to a telegram of the 31st December, 1916, fromthe British Military Attache, Petrograd, to the War Office(Appendix III), and the note thereto by the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff, the Director of Military Operations explained that one reason why many of the 4&apos;5-inch howitzers and 5-inch howitzerssupplied by this country had not been taken into use by the Russianswas that the distribution had been slow, due probably to the factthat these weapons were new to their troops and that the training ofthe men in their use was a slow process. It was urged that it mightbe advisable to point out to the Russian Government that we couldnot afford to continue the manufacture and supply of guns to them if they were not brought into use.   The War Cabinet decided that The Chief of the Imperial General Staff should instruct themilitary representative accompanying the forthcomingmission to Russia, to bring the matter to the notice of theRussian Authorities.(Initialled)A.

Reprisals for Oumages-Dear Colonel Hankey, War OfficejWhitehaU, S.W., January 1, 1.017.The Extract from the Draft Minutes which! return is,T believe, correct. &apos; I onlycame into the room when the question was under discussion and did not like to intervene.I do not thmk it goes far enough. The Germans may take exceptional measuresshort of death, e.g., solitary confinement and imprisonment, against crews of merchant ships ; and I suggestthat the threat of reprisals should cover any action by the GermanGovernment which is not in consonance with thelordinary and accepted&quot; treatment ofPrisoners of War.SircereiJy yours,(Signed)   H. E, BELFIELD.Extract from Minutes of the 2?,-d Meeting of the War Cabinet of the30th December, 1916.Eeprisals for 18. With reference to the discussion on the 13th DecemberOutrages. (War Cabinet 6) on the case of Captain Blaikie, the War cabinet decided that che policy then agreed to, with special reference to that case, should be adopted as a general policy, namely, that, in theevent of the execution of captain or crews of merchant ships,reprisal would be undertaken. The Foreign Office should intimatethis tc the American Ambassador.APPENDIX II.Shortage of Merchant Shipping : Horses.O.B./1859.     /&apos; General Headquarters, British Armiesk&apos;1&quot;&apos; in France, December 28, 1916.W11H reference to the suggestion for the removal of a portion of the cavalry toan area in /France where supplies of forage could be obtained locally, which I putim^t      t^ie meetmS 0^ tne War Committee held on Thursday, 23rd November,it &quot;^ve tne honour to report that after  careful consideration I have been compelled; to abandon the project.tv ^ only area which the French authorities could offer me is situated in theDeparterfienl; de 1&apos;Orne and a reconnaissance of the district shows : (o,.)&apos;i That accommodation for men and horses is so scarce that it would necessitate the scattering of billets over large areas. This is undesirable, both asregards training and dicipline. &apos;That only a small area would be available for training and that this area liesat a considerable distance from the places where the majority of the troops could be billeted.That no saving in shipping would be gained, as the French will not allowanything to be furnished in this district, except hay, and we are alreadypurchasing all the hay available in that district.l(d.) That it is doubtful if there would be any appreciable saving in railway truckssince, although the transport of 300 or 400 tons of wheat from the south toRouen, would be avoided, we should have to send down by rail to the cavalry all other supplies.In these circumstances I have decided to retain the cavalry in the British zone,aut&apos;1 I have so informed the French General Headquarters,j I have, &amp;c.(Signed)      L.
