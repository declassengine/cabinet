THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that,while the&apos; greater part of the British reinforcements that we had undertaken to send to Salonica had arrived there, the French were still very behindhand, as only part of the first two divisions theyhad agreed to send had arrived. Some 7,000 British drafts still have to-be sent, but the French force at Salonica is short of some50,000 drafts.The First Sea Lord said that the French had asked for the loan of five troop-ships and four horse transports ; they had requisitionedall their own available shipping, having taken up twenty-nine extraships, and still had to find seven hospital ships. The admiralty had looked into the question and found it impossible to lend thefive troop-ships. The War Office had been asked if they couldspare four of our horse transports if we did not send any more divisions to Salonica, but had not yet replied.B
The War Cabinet decided that the Admiralty and War office should concert arrangements to lend four horse trans-ports to theFrench Government, subject to the condition that we could recall them if -we needed them ourselves.2. The War Cabinet had some discussion as to the Minister torepresent the British Government at the forthcoming Conferencein Russia. It was pointed out that this Conference had been pro-posed on our initiative, and that great disappointment would be caused if some prominent Minister did not represent us. the objects of the Conference were to arrange a meeting betweenprominent generals of the British and Russian armies ; to discovernot only how far we could help Russia with munitions, and how far the Russians could make effective use of them, but also how far theRussians could assist us financially and by making better use ofRussian man-power for meeting their own requirements.The War Cabinet decided that the Foreign Office should informour Allies that our representatives would be ready to startimmediately after Christmas. No final decision was taken asregards a Ministerial representative, but the opinion was expressed that, if Mr. Balfour^s state of health would permit him to go, itwould be very much in the national interest.Greece. 3.

Secretary reported that he had been in communication with theOffice of Works with regard to the offices of the War Cabinet. Hehad been informed that the occupation of Montagu House by theWar Cabinet would cause very great dislocation to the housingarrangements of the Ministry of Munitions, who had planned to accommodate an office of 500 persons in and about this house, andhad placed the contracts for the necessary alterations. The Officeof Works had suggested as an alternative that the Ministry ofMunitions should vacate Nos. 1 and 3, Whitehall Gardens, namely,the old National Club and the Crown Agents Offices. the accommodation in these houses would enable each Member of theWar Cabinet to have a room for himself and his secretarial staff, aswell as to house the staff of the Cabinet. The War Cabinetsanctioned this proposal subject to the Prime Ministers approval.(Initialled) A. B. L.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,December 12, 1916.[1365   2]

Elliot reports that King agreed to withdraw fromThessaly the 10th Division, which was in excess of normal peacegarrison; he also suggested Entente Military Attaches going toThessaly to see for themselves. Pie said no additional troops hadbeen sent to Thessaly, and that those brought back from Moreawere concentrated in and near Athens. He wished to restore calmby disembarkation of British Colony now on board at Piraeus.Sir F. Elliot replied that this last was impossible ; that he himself had made all arrangements to embark, and that, if the King wouldnot comply with Allied demand for reparation, he would leave. he suggests King being told what he must do if blockade is to beraised.Sir F. Elliot reports that Italian Minister is very hostile toVenizelos and his movement, and furious with the French. TheItalian policy is a weak Greece, and they fear this may be upset bya Venizelist Government.Sir F. Elliot suggests that Entente demands should be presented to King, and that Entente Ministers should go on board and awaithis reply.   If unsatisfactory, they should leave for Italy.Sir F. Elliot recommends joint occupation of Corfu by Allies,and arrest of Royal hostages there.Military attaches at Athens mistrust withdrawal of threeregiments from Thessaly restoring normal conditions, and thinktheir own presence in Thessaly could serve no useful purpose.Sir F. Elliot thinks King will not dare to declare war onAllies ; Greek nation and army (except hot-headed Royalists) wouldbe against it. Our policy should be to put forward far-reaching-demands, including complete disarmament. The blockade would soon make King come to terms. Royalists and Venizelists beingirreconcilable, only thing to do is to recognise Provisional Govern-ment. We should not impose Venizelos on Greece, but we shouldstrongly take up cause of his adherents. By reducing Greece toimpotence, King&apos;s position would become impossible, and rest will follow.The Foreign Office instructs Sir F. Elliot as to action to betaken with the Greek Government.(For full text see Appendix II.)Sir F. Elliot says our demands must be presented as&quot;preliminary &quot; only. Our various controls must be re-established ;reservists leagues must be completely dissolved; and Venizelistsreleased and compensated.Sir F.

In any case, bombardment will be confined to King&apos;s palace and gun emplacements.

French Ambassador has stated that hisGovernment regard deposition of King, and recognition of Venizelos,as only means of avoiding war with Greece.Dec. 10, No. 1189. Sir R. Rodd demurs to sentence in proposed Allies&apos; demand toKing of Greece, &quot; failure to comply with these two demands,&quot; assuggesting that overt hostilities are the only alternative. He fearsour putting ourselves in the wrong with Greek public opinion byprovoking an unnecessary rupture.Dec. 10, No. 19S5. Sir F. Elliot reports that M. Venizelos says that all hostagesshall be well treated, and hopes to catch some in the islandsbelonging to Old Greece. Enquires if the Syra hostages taken toMudros should not be handed over to the Provisional Government;concurs that for deterrent effect hostages should be in Greek hands.Dec. 10, No. 1987. Sir F.

Sir F. Elliot wares for further details as to Foreign office telegram No. 1476.APPENDIX II.Telegram to Sir F. Elliot [Athens), December 9, 1916.Recent events in Athens have proved- conclusively that neitherthe King nor the Greek Government have sufficient control over theGreek army to prevent Greek forces becoming a menace to peace and a clanger to the Allied armies in Macedonia.Under these circumstances the Governments of the AlliedPowers are constrained to demand, for the security of their forces from attack, that the Greek troops now stationed in Northern Greece be immediately removed to the Morea, and that the evacuation commencewithin twenty-four hours and proceed as rapidly as possible. they further demand that any movements of Greek troops from theMorea to Northern Greece be immediately suspended. - Failure tocomply with these two demands will be regarded by the Aiaas asan act of hostility on the part of the Greek Government.The blockade of the Greek coast will be maintained until fullreparation has been given for the recent unprovoked attack by theGreek forces upon the troops of the Allies at Athens, together withsatisfactory guarantees for the future.You should make a formal communication to the GreekGovernment in the above terms as soon as your colleagues havereceived similar instructions. , .
Telegram from Sir F. Elliot (Athens), December 10, 1916.Your telegram No. 1465 of yesterday.What interpretation do you wish given to expression &quot; NorthernGreece &quot; ?Is it meant to include whole of continental Greece, and, if not,what part ?Are Epirus and southern Albania included ?The inclusion of Athens and neighbouring districts Avould,especially in view of recent events and of pretended fear of a revolution, render acceptance of our demand very problematical.Does demand imply that no Greek troops whatever are to beretained, even for maintenance of order?Besides re-establishment of controls in place of those abolished(vide my telegram No. 1979 of to-day), should not mention be madeof railway facilities which we shall require in connection with theestablishment of an overland line of communication for supply ofSalonica ?APPENDIX IV.Summary of telegrams referring to the Arab Revolt.Dec. 9, No. 1062.
