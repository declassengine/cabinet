The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that he hadbeen in communication with General Nivelle, and, under theimpression that Monday and Tuesday would be inconvenient datesowing to the approaching departure of the British Mission to Russia,had fixed the following Wednesday (24th January) for his arrival inLondon.   It was pointed out that for certain reasons the. Frendh
Government were anxious that General nivelle&apos;s visit should takeplace as early as possible, and that their wishes could now be met,since   the   departure  of  the   Russian  Mission was to be post-poned in deference to the wishes of the Russian Government.The War Cabinet decided that: The Chief of the Imperial General Staff should communicate with General Nivelle, informing him that an earlier date would now be acceptable to the British Government, and suggesting Monday, the 15th January, 1917.Destruction of 3. The Chief  of  the  Imperial  General Staff read a veryGrain in Eoumania.   satisfactory telegram reporting the extent of the destruction of grainand various factories in Roumania in front of the enemy&apos;s advance.The Sinai He referred also to the victory gained by the British troops inPeninsula. the Sinai Peninsula.

The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that theGeneral Officer Commanding-in-Chief the Egyptian ExpeditionaryForce had reported that British aeroplanes were now flying to withina distance of 100 miles of Rabegh, and had been successful inbombing all the Turkish forces so far seen.He added that, according to information received by him, theGermans were expanding their forces by ten to twelve fresh divisions,which they had been probably enabled to do by the withdrawal of menfrom the various industries under the recent drastic regulations.The forthcoming conference inRussia.5. The War Cabinet decided that: In view of a telegram from the British Ambassador at petrograd (No. 40), dated the 10th January (Appendix I),the departure of the&quot; British Delegates to the Conferencein Russia should be deferred until the 20th January at theearliest; and that the Foreign Office should so inform theFrench and Italian Governments, laying special emphasis on the fact that this postponement was carried out at therequest of the Russian Government.The Utilisation of fighting Ships forthe Conveyance ofTroops.6. The First Sea Lord, in reference to his letter on this subjectof the 6th January, 1917 (Appendix ID, reported that the questionof refitting battleships and cruisers to act as transports had beentaken up, but that these vessels were, for various reasons, unsuitable for the purpose ; their conversion would take some five weeks tocarry out, and would entail delay to other urgent work. On thewhole, he was not in favour of this course being adopted.The forthcomingAllied naval conference.7. The First Lord stated that the Admiralty had the arrange-ments in hand for the forthcoming Naval Conference.
1UGreece:Reply to the Allies&apos;TJftimatum.Attended in connec-tion with thisQuestion and questions 9, 10,and 11 :Sir RonaldGraham.8. In reference to the reply of the Greek Government to the ultimatum of the Allies (Appendix III), the War Cabinet decidedthat: The Foreign Office should inform the French Government by telegram that the reply of the Greek Government to theAllies&apos; Ultimatum was regarded by the British Governmentsubstantially as an acceptance of so much of the RomanNote as dealt with the withdrawal of troops and material from northern Greece, but that in respect to the other requirements of the Note there were one or two points ofimportance which would have to be cleared up before theblockade of the Greek ports could be relaxed.The Foreign Office should also inform the Greek Governmentquite definitely that no relaxation of the blockade wouldbe permitted until the Allied Governments were satisfied onall points with the reply of the Greeks to the Note of theAllied Governments.Enemy shipping in South AmericanPorts.Attended in connec-tion with thisQuestion and questions 10 and11 :Sir Joseph Maclay,Controller ofShipping.Sir Albert Stanley,President of theBoard of Trade.&apos; 9. The War Cabinet had under consideration a memorandumby the Minister of Blockade on the subject of Enemy Shipping inSouth American ports. It was agreed that it would be a violation of neutrality on the part of the South American Republics to requisition enemy ships seeking asylum in their ports, though theindiscriminate sinking by the enemy of neutral ships might, onthe other hand, be held to justify a measure of retaliation of thiskind. It was also generally agreed that, in view of the presentserious shortage of tonnage, considerations such as the fact that thepurchase of enemy^ships might put the enemy in funds, which had previously carried great weight, should now be disregarded.The War Cabinet decided that: The question should be dealt with by the Minister of Blockade,the Shipping Controller, and the President of the Boardof Trade, who should report their action to the WarCabiuet.Decoy Vessels for 10. The First Sea Lord stated that the Admiralty desired to action against take up eight coasting steamers to be fitted out as decoy vessels tonemy u marines. engage German submarines, the employment of such vessels havingbeen found, on the whole, to be the most effective method of dealingwith submarines. He drew attention to the fact that the destructionof even one enemy submarine might possibly save the subsequentloss of many of our merchant vessels.The Shipping Controller stated that he fully realised theimportance of this work, and had already released two ships to theAdmiralty, but felt that the responsibility for the release of furthervessels from the carrying trade should rest with the War Cabinet,in view of the great pressure being exerted by the French andItalian Governments to obtain tonnage, particularly for the con-veyance of coal.The War Cabinet decided that: Six further coasting vessels, or eight in all, should be released by the Shipping Controller for the purpose indicated.Coal for Prance.i 11. The War Cabinet had under consideration a note by thePresident of the Board of Trade, of the 6th January, 1917, on the
subject of &quot; Tbe Position with regard to the Requirements of coal for France.&quot;It was decided that: This subject should be referred  for consideration  by theforthcoming Allied Naval and Shipping Conference.Employment of 12. In reference to the letter  from  the  Secretary of  the prisoners of &quot;War.     Prisoners of War Employment Committee, of the 10th January, 1917(Appendix IV), the War Cabinet approved the action proposed.(Initialled) D. LI. G.2, Whitehall Gardens, S. W ,January 12, 1917.
* ....Telegram from Sir G. Buchanan (Petrograd), No. 40, of January 10, 1917.(Urgent,)MY telegram No. 39.I received Lord Milner&apos;s telegram from home after seeing the Minister for ForeignAffairs this morning, but communicated its contents before he saw the President of theCouncil. He has now informed me that the latter would prefer that the date of departure should be postponed till 20th January if this does not cause inconvenienceto His Majesty&apos;s Government. I gather that one reason why he desires this postpone-ment is that the Duma is to meet 25th January, and that he would sooner that conference did not assemble till after first two or three sittings, which may be verystormy ones.APPENDIX II.The Utilisation of Fighting ships foe the Conveyance of Troops.For War Cabinet, from First Sea Lord.THE question of utilising fighting ships for the conveyance of troops in theMediterranean has been investigated.In order to fit a battleship of the &quot;Exmouth Class to carry a battalion of infantry,it is estimated that at least five weeks is required in which to effect the essentialalterations. A considerable amount of work is involved in providing even the minimum of comfort for the troops, a battleship being a most unsuitable type of ship to use forthis purpose. This work involves not only expense, but also labour which is urgently required for important work affecting the fighting efficiency of the Navy, and it canonly be carried out at the expense of deferring the refits of other fighting ships,whether it is carried out in a Royal dockyard or by contract.The &quot; Magnificent&quot; and &quot; Mars,&quot; battleships of older but similar type to the&quot; Exmouth,&quot; were converted for carrying troops in September 1915, but the accommo-dation provided was very poor, and frequent and strong complaints were lodged bythe military authorities. To meet these complaints further alterations were made;the number of troops carried was reduced, but the result was not satisfactory.The number of troops that could be sent in one of the Exmouth Class is estimatedat not more than 1,000, and they wrould be quartered under very unfavourableconditions as compared with ordinary transports.The personnel question is also a serious one. In order to work the ships efficiently,and to be able to maintain a good speed to avoid submarines, a large complement estimated at 380 is required, and the greater number of these must be men who are familiar with men-of-war and their fittings. That is to say, in order to carry 1,000troops under uncomfortable conditions, nearly 400 men, who could be more profitablyemployed in the fleet, are locked up. The personnel question is most serious atpresent especially as regards officers.Owing to the construction of the ships it would not be possible to carry sufficientboats for all hands, and a large number of patent rafts would be required. In bad weather these rafts afford very little security.The expense of running these ships is great as compared with ordinary transports;for owing to their greater displacement and draught of water, due to the armourcarried, more coal is required, and there is more wear and tear to machinery, involvingmore frequent repairs and refits.A further drawback to the use of the older type of battleships as transports isthat they have a tendency to heel over and capsize if torpedoed, making it a difficult and dangerous matter to handle the boats and get them away safely ; a merchant shipusually remains fairly upright for a time.The older cruisers are even more unsuitable for use as transports, and carry fewermen.I consider it would be a mistake to attempt the use of war ships as transports,again.J.
