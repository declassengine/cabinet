THE War Cabinet discussed the situation created by theauthority given by the French Government to General Sarrail (as reported by M. Ribot at the Anglo-French Conference held earlier in the day) to take such military action as he considered necessaryagainst the remnant of the Greek Army at Larissa, the question for decision being whether they should confirm the instructions toGeneral Sarrail, and, if so, whether they should impose conditions.The decision depends to a great extent upon whether the GreekGovernment are or are not carrying out their agreement, on whichthe evidence is somewhat conflicting. The French regard thewithdrawal as a sham, but the British military authorities incline tothe view that the Greeks are carrying out the withdrawal at thestipulated rate.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs desired it to be recorded on the minutes that, in his opinion, if Greece is attacked,then there would be danger that the British, French, and Venizelists* in Greece will be massacred.
At the request of the War Cabinet, a telegram was sent by theDirector of Military Intelligence to the Military Attache at Athensasking for full explanations as to the nature of the withdrawal.   &quot;*j.gThe War Cabinet decided to reply to the French delegates inthe sense that we are prepared to acquiesce in the powers given by the French Government to General Sarrail,subject to the following conditions : -(I.) If it can be shown to the satisfaction of GeneralsSarrail and Milne that the evacuation of Thessalyis not proceeding at the rate and in the manneragreed to by the King of Greece.(2.) Provided that General Sarrai! shall first let theBritish and French Governments know the natureof the military operations which he proposes toundertake.2. The War Cabinet discussed the proposal of the FrenchGovernment that two British divisions should be sent to Salonica inaddition to the two additional divisions which the French havedecided to send.The War Cabinet do not underrate the bad results, and par-ticularly the harmful moral effect on the nations and armies of theAllies, that would follow a disaster to the Allies in the Balkans.The Chief of * the Imperial General Staff, though unable to guarantee that the Germans Avould not penetrate into Greece if theAllies withdrew from Monastir, considered that this ought not to occur provided the Allied Army remained intact and had previouslyoccupied a defensive position suitable to its size, and had formed,- asit could do, a strong mobile reserve for action against the enemy&apos;seastern flank. He wished to place on record his opinion that wecould not efficiently maintain two additional divisions in the Balkans,in view of the great difficulty already experienced in maintaining our existing forces in this theatre at full strength owing to the lackof shipping and the precarious condition of our sea communications.&quot;He pointed out that the British divisions could not arrive until theend of March.Sir Rennell Rodd stated that he had for many months been pressing the Italian Government to give more co-operation in the balkans, but they had replied that they had not sufficient guns.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that general cadorna had, he understood, declined to send any further forces tothe Balkans except for a big offensive in conjunction with theRussians, and this was not at present possible.In reply to an enquiry from the Prime Minister, Sir Rennell Roddsaid that if the British Government were to enter into an arrange-ment to send a force of heavy guns in the event of a big offensive bythe Central Powers against the Italian front, the Italian government might be more inclined to agree.The War Cabinet adjourned the question for further considera-tion, and decided to inform the French representatives that we are not yet in a position to give a definite answerwith regard to the two additional divisions, pending furtherinformation as to : (a.) The shipping problem. ....(b.) The source from wdiich the divisions could be drawn,(c.) Tbe assistance that may be given by Italy.(Initialled)      D. LI.
