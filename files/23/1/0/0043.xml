THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported to the WarCabinet that the two sons of the Sherif had been conductingoperations in the region of Medina, the Emir Abdullah having been successful to the east of the railway, while the Emir Faisal wasoperating nearer the coast. It was probable that the two intendedto join forces for further concerted action.Western Front.2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that two additional German divisions had been located in Alsace, making atotal of five arrived during the last month. There were nosufficiently clear indications, as yet, to justify the formation of an opinion as to what these movements meant.Russia,G-uns for.3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that thearrangements for shipping guns and material from Liverpool for russia were in a very unsatisfactory condition, owing to lack of proper supervision and control by the Russian Commission in thiscountry, notwithstanding repeated representations to Russia on thesubject. 53 heavy guns had been despatched, 32 were still waiting,and 16 were now arriving at Liverpool. It had been decided[1365-43] B
to hold up the shipment of 8-inch and 9-inch howitzers in order to expedite the despatch of the 60-pr. gunB and 6-inch howitzers.The Naval Action.4. As part of a statement on various naval events, Captain Hall,the Director of the Intelligence Division, Admiralty War Staff,made a report, on the recent Xaval Action off the Dutch coast.Greece:The ControlArrangements.5. With reference to a note by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs&apos;, dated the: 23rd January, 1917, in regard to theposition in Greece (Appendix), the War Cabinet expressed concern at the delay in carrying out the agreement arrived at withthe French at the Conferences held in London on the 26th-2tfthDecember, whereby &quot; French officers selected by General Sarrail, and british officers selected by General Milne, should be sent byGeneral Sarrail in order to see whether Thessaly and the1&apos;iraBus were being evacuated by the Greek troops underthe conditions and at the rate laid down in the allied ultimatum.&quot;It appeared that two British officers had been sent to Athens some weeks ago, but that there, had been delay in securing Greek permission to go to Larissa. These officers had been definitely placed, on the21st January, under the immediate orders cf General Milne, subjectto General Sarraif&apos;s instructions. One of them, Captain Cockerell,had by that date reached Larissa, but General Phillips was keptwaiting at Athens pending the arrival of a French General. the greeks had attached an officer to General Phillips, and hadfcgivenhim every facility.The War Cabinet directed the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff to order General Milne (1.) To send General Phillips to Larissa at once unless general sarrail objected.(2.) To send British officers for control purposes to Corinth,where there were at present only French officers.-Unity of Policy 6. With reference to the necessity for securing real unity inAmong the Allies action in dealing with the Greek situation, the War Cabinet hadin Greek Affairs. some discussion on reports which had reached this country to theeffect that, in the Secret Sessions of the French Parliament, theFrench Government had attempted to lay the blame for the Greeksituation on the British Government, and that a false impressionhad consequently been created in the minds of the French public.The War Cabinet decided that: The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should prepare aMemorandum fully setting out the sequence of eventsduring the last few months. This Memorandum could then, as might be deemed advisable, be sent as a despatch to the British Ambassador in Paris, who should use his discretion as to the best manner in which to convey to theFrench Government both the necessity for unity in action,and the undesirability of the British Government beingcompelled, in justice to itself, to make statements in answer to Parliamentary criticism which might not be inharmony with the statements made in the French secret session.
Circulation of 8. With reference to War Cabinet 3, Minute 6, the War cabinet papers- decided that-The Secretary of State for Home Affairs should be included inthe list of those to whom the Papers referred to thereinshould be sent.Agenda Paper. 9. The War Cabinet decided The Agenda Papers of Meetings to be held should be sent tothose heads of Departments who ordinarily receive theMinutes and other Papers, so as to enable them tocommunicate with the Secretary if any subject is comingup for discussion at which, in their opinion, their departments should be represented.(Initialled)      D. LI. G.2, Whitehall dardens, S.W.,January 24, 1917.Propaganda. 7. With reference to the decision taken on the 2nd Januarythat propaganda should be under a separate Department of State(War Cabinet 25, Minute 9), the War Cabinet had before themPapers on the British Propaganda in Allied and Neutral Countries(War Cabinet Papers C.-10i and 102 and a Note by the GeneralStaff), and discussed the reorganisation of the existing machineryfor propaganda work. The unsatisfactory prosecution of british propaganda, with special reference to the want of knowledge and tothe need of briskness in its dissemination, had been the subject ofconsiderable criticism. It was suggested that what was required was not so much an attempt to convert neutrals by pamphlets as an effective system for the speedy distribution of sound news in thiscountry, the Allied countries, and among neutrals. Attention was drawn to our failure to make any impression on the American west and Middle West, and to the extent to which the Germans, by boldand skilful contracts for advertising matter, were closing a large area of the American newspaper and publishing world to british propaganda. It was stated that only one American publishing firmwould now publish British propaganda.The War Cabinet recognised the necessity that, while the future organisation should be independent, it should maintain the closestassociation with the Foreign Office in regard to the policy to be pursued.The War Cabinet decided that The first step is to select the head of the new organisation andto invite him to report on the whole question with a viewto the establishment of a good home organisation as a preliminary. The names and qualifications of severalpossible heads for the proposed new organisation were discussed, and the Prime Minister undertook to interviewsome of those suggested.
The Position in Greece.Note by Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE diplomatic position as regards the movement of Greek troops is extraordi--narily confused, and the confusion is so great that I think it may easily becomedangerous.   I think that a serious attempt ought to be made to clear it up.The confusion is partly confusion of machinery, partly of policy, and, though thetwo are closely connecte 1, I think that, they must be considered separately.The normal machinery for obtaining military information in a friendly country isprovided by the military attaches, svho are under the direction of the Ministers of theirrespective Governments. This is the only machinery that was in existence in Greeceup till the Conference of London at the end of last month, and it seems to be still theonly machinery that is doing any work.At the Conference of London a radical change was resolved on. In deference toM. Ribot and his colleagues tie Conference decided that the responsibility for&quot;checking&quot; Greek military movements should rest with French and British officersappointed respectively by General Sarrail and General Milne, but under the order ofthe former.Not only had nothing effective been done, so far as I am aware, to carry out thispolicy, either by the French, who initiated it, or by the British, who agreed to it ; butthe only step that had been taken to strengthen the staff of-military experts engagedin watching the movements of Greek troops, namely, the appointment of GeneralPhillips, belongs to the old system, not the new. General Phillips was sent out to greece (in obedience apparently to a decision of the War Committee arrived at in thefirst days of the present Government) to act, not unner General Sarrail, but under sir F. Elliot. Though he did not, arrive there until some time after the london conference, he evidently represented a policy which that Conference had deliberatelyintended to reverse.In these circumstances, I telegraphed on the 21st of this month to Athens to saythat General Phillips should be transferred from Sir F. Elliot to General Milne andshould act in accordance with the plan which the London Conference had laid down,and which I have just described I cannot find out that this has been done, or thatGeneral Sarrail is carrying out in any form his own policy of an independent militaryinspection conducted under his orders.In my opinion, this state of things should be put an end to one way or the other.I have no particular admiration for General sarrail&apos;s scheme, but it is the schemeassented to by Great Britain and France, and it is quite intolerable that we shordd not know whether it is to become a reality, or is to remain one of the many proofs thatwhen an international conference comes to a decision nothing is really decided.The question of policy is more important and more perplexing. We are all agreedthat Greece must be prevented from hampering us from the south while Germans andBulgarians are attacking us from the north. &apos; We are not wholly agreed as to the magnitude of the danger or the best methods of meeting it. Among the principaldramatis personal are General Sarrail, who certainly looks at Greek questions quite asmuch with the eye of a politician as with that of a General, and whose whole procedure is that of a man who wishes to pick a quarrel on the first opportunity ; the french minister, who, long distrusted by the rest of the world, is now distrusted by his own government; and the King of Greece, who has played his part under what must beadmitted to be difficult circumstances, but has earned universal contempt from friendand foe. If the King could be trusted to carry out his word ; if General Sarrail wrouldlook at matters from a purely military point of view ; and if the French authorities, nolonger misled by the French Minister, would avoid such deplorable blunders as thosewhich preceded tbe incidents of the 1st December, we should get on without much difficulty.   Unfortunately, the real state of affairs is very different.In private conversation with the Prime Minister General Sarrail, I understand,,indicated that his plan of operations was confined to seizing Greek guns, rifles, and munitions of war, stored at Larissa, and perhaps other places in Northern Greece.These once in the possession of the Allies, he professed himself (in this conversation):as indifferent to anything that the Greeks could do.   This plan, so far as I know, has
never been stated in writing to either the French Government or the BritishGovernment. On the contrary, the seizing of Larissa was described, not as a raid for arms, but as the &quot;occupation of a new base.&quot; It is not very clear to me what thevalue, from a military point of view, of this new base may be.Our General Staff are of opinion, I believe, that the Greek Government are carrying out their promises with as much celerity as may be expected, and they would regard open hostilities with Greece as a serious military calamity; while our Ministerholds it to be a mistake, from the point of view of law and order, to insist on theremoval of all regular Greek troops from Thessaly.Such is the situation : undoubtedly embarrassing, possibly perilous. I suggestthat the following questions should be settled to the best of our ability : 1. On whom is to faU the main responsibility for inspecting the manner in whichthe Greek Government are carrying out their promises as regards the movement oftroops and munitions. It is nearly a month since the London Conference sat, and neither General Sarrail nor General Milne appears to have carried out the plan laiddown in London on French initiative.2. If we become convinced, not merely that there are Germanophiles in GreekCourt and military circles, which is certain, but that the King of Greece is deliberatelycheating the Allies, breaking his promises, and playing for time, what steps ought theAllies to take in self-protection, and when ? Should we gain or lose, in a strictly military sense, if we went to war with Greece before overt action, such as diggingtrenches, preparing emplacements, &amp;c., had been taken by Greece against us ?Until these and ether cognate questions are settled, I find it very difficult to knowin what sense to communicate either with Sir R. Rodd in Rome or Sir F. Elliotin Athens.(Signed) A. J. B.Foreign Office, January 23, 1917.
