THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that three German divisions in all had during the previous three weeksbeen transferred from the Eastern to the Western front, one fromthe Russian and two from the Roumanian fronts. Two of these divisions had been located in the region of Ypres and one in theneighbourhood of La Bassee. A certain number of heavy guns had also been concentrated in the former area, where there had been a recrudescence of hostile shelling. These guns had been transferred from the Somme.2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that,according to intelligence obtained from prisoners, two german divisions had been withdrawn from, the Roumanian front, but thatthere was no information as yet to show whether these divisions hadbeen moved for the purpose of resting behind the line or with a.view to transfer elsewhere.Greece. 3. The War Cabinet took note of telegram No. 182, dated the22nd January, 1917, from the British Minister at Athens, setting forth in some detail the negotiations between the representative ofthe Military Attaches of the Allies and the representatives of theGreek General Staff in regard to the movement of troops andmaterial, both in connection with the matter specified in the technicalnote of the 14th December, 1916, and the execution of the newdemands contained in the note of the 31st December.
Naval Action. 4.  The Prime  Minister  informed   the   War  Cabinet  that,according to information received from the Admiralty, a destroyeraction had taken place in the North Sea. -Not much news was yet available, but one British destroyer was known to have been sunk,and one enemy destroyer was believed to have been sunk.Man-Power.Resources of theEmpire.Australia.New Zealand.Canada.Attended in connec-tion with minutes and 6 :Lt.-Gen.

The War Cabinet approved the following recommendationsof the Army Council in their &quot; Kate on the Available Resources ofMan-Power, both White and Coloured, in the Oversea Dominions andDependencies of the Empire &quot; (Appendix I) : &quot; 14. Recommendations. In regard to the forces of the self-governing Dominions, the Army Council makes thefollowing recommendations :  &quot;(i.) That the Commonwealth Government be urged to take steps at once for the formation of a sixth AustralianDivision.&quot; (ii.) That the Government of Kew Zealand be urged toundertake at once the formation of a second NewZealand Division.&quot; (iii.) That the Government of Canada be urged to agree tosend the fifth Division&apos;to France as soon as it can becompleted to establishment, less its artillery, andwhen its training is sufficiently advanced, and further to examine the possibility of raising a sixth Division.&quot; Should it subsequently be found in the case of any ofthe above that sufficient reinforcements are not forthcoming tomaintain an increased number of divisions in the field, thenew formations can be used to provide drafts; or, as analternative, the infantry of divisions can be reduced to ninebattalions.&quot;The Secretary of State for the Colonies undertook to initiatethe necessary action.&quot; 15. The Council further recommend that instructions be issued to His Majesty&apos;s High Commissioner in Egypt to take immediate steps to raise three new Egyptian Battalions,with a view to releasing three fully trained Soudanese orArab Battalions for service in Egypt, so that the lattercan be placed at Sir Archibald Murray&apos;s disposal not later than the 1st August next.&quot; In view of the Sirdar&apos;s statement that there is great difficultyin maintaining the existing Soudanese Battalions at allunder present conditions, and also of the additionalgarrisons rendered necessary by the recent acquisitionof territory, the Council are of opinion that the wholequestion of voluntary enlistment in the Soudan shouldbe examined with a view to ascertaining whether itcould not be stimulated by the offer of increasedinducements. Should this prove to be the case, theCouncil recommend that a Brigade of four Arab orSoudanese Battalions be formed for employment inEgypt.&quot;The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs undertook to initiatethe necessary action.
Agriculture. 6. In reference to the question of the number of men whichcould be withdrawn from agriculture, the War Cabinet decided toask Mr. Walter Long to preside over a Conference consisting of Lord Derby,Field-Marshal Lord French,Lord Devonport,Lord Khondda,Mr. Prothero, andMr. Munro,to consider the best method of selecting and replacing the 30,000men from agriculture whom the President of the Board of Agriculturehad agreed to release for General Service. This Conference was to sit immediately, and report to the next Meeting of the War Cabinet,to be held that afternoon (see War Cabinet, 39, paragraph 1 (a) ).(Initialled)      D. LI.

War Office Number^27__Gen. No.5941APPENDIX 1*Note on the Available Resources of Max-Power, both White and Colouredin the Overseas Dominions and Dependencies of the Empire.1. In considering the attached Tables (I. to IV.) comparing the man-power figuresof the four Overseas Dominions with those of the United Kingdom, the differenteconomic conditions of the several Dominions must be kept in mind. Many of thestaple industries (eg., gold mining in South Africa, lumber trade in Canada, &amp;c.) do notlend themselves readily to the substitution of female labour. On the other hand, littlemunition work is being done in Australia, New Zealand or South Africa, and even inCanada a much smaller percentage of the population is engaged on this work than isthe case in the Mother Country. Other factors differentiating between the Dominionsand Colonies are the varying proportions of alien elements in the populations. Thus inCanada we have important communities of American, Scandinavian, Prussian, &amp;c, birth,scarcely amenable to voluntary recruiting agenciesMoreover, large and varying numbers from the several Dominions and Colonieshave p:oceeded at their own expense to the United Kingdom to enlist, and onlyestimates of these can be given. &apos;2. South Africa. The number of additional men to be expected from South africa is not great, in view of the fact that no large proportion of those of Dutch extraction islikely to enlist voluntarily for service in Europe. It has already been suggested to theUnion Government, however, that the South African Contingent serving in France, whichat present consists of one infantry brigade, five siege batteries and certain auxiliaryunits, should be expanded to a division, and efforts to this end are being made.The latest information is to the effect that recruiting with a view to the formationof a second infantry brigade, and a proportion of the divisional troops (Engineers and medical units) will be undertaken from 1st January. It is hoped that the recent decisionto grant Union rates of pay to all South African troops serving in Europe will havea beneficial effect on recruiting.3. Australia. There still remains a large reserve of man-power in Australia.In May last the Commonwealth Government held out hopes of a sixth Australiandivision being raised, but were not sanguine of being able to maintain it in the field.The result of the referendum on compulsory service, however, has not only falsifiedthose hopes, but has led the Government to question the feasibility of maintaining the.five existing divisions in the field. The reinforcements required to maintain the fiveAustralian Divisons in France and the Mounted Brigades in Egypt for 12* monthsamounts to approximately 140,000 in the aggregate. A sixth division, with 12 months&apos;reserves behind it, would require approximately 44,000 additional Category &quot; A &quot; men.From the figures given in Table II. it appears that it should be feasible to raise a sixthdivision and maintain adequate reserves for all six divisions and the Mounted division in Egypt.4. New Zealand. From the figures in Table II. it appears that New Zealand shouldhave some 76,000 men of military age and physically fit still available. After allowing for 12 months reserves for the New Zealand Contingent already at the front there shouldbe at least 30,000 left for disposal. This number would suffice to raise a second division with five months reserves behind it. It may be argued that the raising of a division with less than 12 months reserves to support it is not justifiable, but in viewof the fact that several months must necessarily elapse before the additional units to* N.B. This was printed as Appendix V for the 89th Meeting, and has been discarded.[1365-41] C
form the second division could be formed and transported to Europe, and that there is every likelihood that by that time the climax of the war must be imminent, if, indeed,it shall net have been reached in the meantime, it will be far more to our advantage,after making due provision for reinforcements for the forces already in the field, toraise additional fio-htincf units than to build up furth-r reinforcements for an indefinite period. At the worst these units could subsequently ba used as reinforcements. A\recent leading article in one of the New Zealand daily newspapers, &quot; The Dominion&quot;(Appendix A), seems to indicate that the people of New Zealand are already alive to theextreme importance of a larger contribution in men from that Dominion. A ready response from New Zealand could hardly fail t^ stimulate similar efforts in other Dominions, j5. Canada. In regard to Canadi, the figures in Table II. speak for them-:selves. The late Minister of Militia, Sir Sam Hughes, was most anxious toform two additional divisions from existing reserves, so that they could take their placein France before the spring of 1917. He was confident that a iequate reserves for allsix divisions would be forthcoming, but just as he was about to put his plan into execution the recent political crisis occurred in Canada and his resignation was the result.At the present time the infantry of a 5th Canadian Division has been formed inbrigades at Witley and steps are being taken to form the necessary divisional troops,with the exception of artillery, but the Canadian Minister in London (Sir G. Perley) isdoubtful as to the wisdom of regarding it as anything more than a draft-findingformation. Artillery for it can be provided in France by the release of the regularartillery at present with the 4th Canadian Division, which will be .replaced during thecurrent month by the despatch of the 4th Canadian Divisional Artillery from England.The question has recently been further complicated by demands for railway con-struction, personnel and lumbermen fivm the Canadian Reserves both in England andin Canada, but in view of the large reserve of man-power still available for combatantpurposes, it appears that it should be practicable to raise sufficient additional reserves to justify the despatch of the 5th Division to France as soon as its training is suffiently advanced, and even the formation of a 6th Division when the 5th has embarked.6. Newfoundland. Newfoundland, in addition to furnishing two battalions and areserve, battalion, has many men serving in the Imperial Navy, and has increased her own naval reserve from 482 to about 1,200.7. India (Table VI.). As regards the Dominions and Dependencies which furnishcoloured populations, it will be seen that the general percentage of the male populationactually serving as compared with the estimated number of Category &quot; A&quot; men of the tribes from which recruits are obtained is very low. The figures in Table VI. are basedon the returns of the 1st January, 1915, but since that date about 69,000 recruitsBurplus to wastage have been enlisted.The Government of India have also agreed recently to raise 16 new infantry battalions. At the present time the war establishment of an Indian infantry battalion is less than that of a British infantry battalion. If the war establish-ment of the former were raised to the British establishment, it Avould give an aggregate increase of 19,000 men in the Indian battalions serving outside India,including the 16 now in process of formation. This increase would not necessitate the addition of any British officers, which is the main difficulty in raising new Indianregiments. It appears that there should be no difficulty in obtaining these recruits if the suggestions of the Viceroy of India as to general betterment of the conditions of service in the Army be sanctioned.   This question has been taken up with the India Office.As regards the white population in India, there are 44,000 efficient volunteers.The Government of India now proposes to embody permanently sufficient of thesewith a view to relieving six British battalions for service outside India,and to organize, equip and train the remainder sufficiently to meet any suddenemergency. Up to the 30th June, 1916, the Indian Army reserve of officers had been increased from 40 to 1,923. These officers were nearly all formerly in the volunteersbut are now either on field service or under training in India.8. Egypt and the Soudan. As regards coloured population in Africa generally,statistics are of little practical  value.      In many countries the estimate of the .population is mainly guess-work and, in any case, certain tribes only are suitable formilitary service as either combatants or non-combatants.  .In Egypt and the Soudan nothing has yet been done, and, in the latter country,serious difficulties to raising additional troops have presented themselves. The Sirdarhas offered to release three existing and fully trained Soudanese or Arab battalions for
service in Egypt, to be replaced by three newly conscripted Egyptian battalions as soon&apos; as the latter can be raised. It is estimated that this would take about six months.The Sirdar has also stated that it mi^ht be possible, by offering increased induce-ments, to enlist voluntarily a brigade of four battalions of Arab and Soudanesetroops. Owing, however, to the fact that existing Soudanese units are at present muchunder establishment, and that there is great difficulty in obtaining recruits, this schemeis open to so many financial and administrative objections that the Sirdar is of opinionthat only great urgency would justify its being put into operation.As regards Kgypt proper, under the terms of the Proclamation of 5th November,1914, declaring a Protectorate over Egypt, Egyptian troops cannot be employed in theactual defence of Egypt against the Turks. It is doubtful if the material availablewould, in any case, be fit to place in the front line, but it is thought that the formationof labour battalions raised by conscription for service both in and outside Egypt wouldnot be contrary to the terms of the proclamation. Local labour corps (presumablyraised voluntarily) have for some t me been employed on the Canal defences with success.   The question of raising such units in Egypt has been taken up.9. East Africa, Uganda and Nyasaland. In accordance with instructions issued in March last and subsequently to General Smuts, and with arrangements madewith the Colonial Office, the King&apos;s African Rifles are in process of expansionto four regiments of three battalions each and a fifth regiment with a specialestablishment for service on the Northern Frontier. Of these, six battalions of thefour regiments and a mounted infantry company are in the field, five more are in process of formation, some of which are well advanced, and the formation of the fifthregiment is being proceeded with. The recruits are obtained from Northern Rhodesia.Nyasaland, Portuguese Mozambique, British East Africa, Uganda, German EastAfrica, Somaliland, surrendered German Askaris and a few Abyssinians. It is probablethat some tribes of doubtful fighting value have been drawn upon. An application to recruit in Belgian territory was vigorously refused by the Belgian Government, andalthough the Portuguese Government declined to allow British recruiting parties intheir territory, recruits are obtained through the Portuguese Administration.Arms and equipment are being provided and the new units will probably be mainlyrequired in East Africa.No further action seems possible at present, but on completion of the campaign in east Africa, when the whole of the enemy territory has been occupied, it should be practicable to obtain a further supply of recruits.10. South Africa. From South Africa two coloured (combatant) battalions are nowin East Africa, as well as numerous details (e.g., transport drivers). A Cape colouredlabour corps (1,000 strong) and a native labour corps (10,000 strong) have been formedand are now either in or en route to France. So that no time may be lost in the eventof a favourable report on their utility, the Union Government has been requested(18th December) to undertake the preliminary arrangements for the supply of furtherlabour contingents.The Union Government were requested to take up the question of forming combatantunits from such races as the Zulus, but are definitely opposed to any action in thisdirection.Recruiting of Basutos for munition work in England and for the South AfricanLabour Corps was found to be impracticable.A proposal to replace Army Service Corps drivers in France by Cape boys has beentaken up.11. Rhodesia. From Northern Rhodesia a battalion of native police is serving in east Africa. As the new King&apos;s African Rifles battalions will recruit in northern rhodesia, it is expected that all further available men will be absorbed thereby. an infantry battalion formed from the white population was offered to the UnionGovernment in 1914, aud took part in the suppression of the rebellion, and in the campaign in German South-West Africa.   It was then disbanded.A second battalion was raised, placed at the disposal of the Imperial Government,and has since been employed in German East Africa. It has been heavily drawn upon for officers of the new Eing&apos;s African Rifles units and for special services, aud is now(January, 1917) reduced to the strength of a company.From Southern Rhodesia a (white) police battalion is serving in East Africa, anda native police battalion was rapidly raised from the Matabele, and is also serving in
East Africa. The white population of Rhodesia is depleted, and much difficulty wouldbe experienced in finding competent officers and non-commissioned officers for any additional native forces.12. West Africa. A battery and a battalion of the Gold Coast Regiment, WestAfrica Frontier Force are now in East Africa with a small number of Gold CoastVolunteers. A Nigerian Overseas Contingent, consisting of one battery, four battalions,signal section, machine-gun company, and a small medical establishment, formed fromthe Nigeria Regiment West Africa Frontier Force has recently arrived in East Africa.Steps are being taken to raise a carrier corps (4,000 strong) in Sierre Leone for service with the overseas contingent in East Africa.Kroomen and carriers for inland water transport in Mesopotamia are beingenlisted ; the latest reports show that 400 men have already been obtained in sierra leone. Further reports are awaited. It is hoped that the Gambia Company, WestAfrica Frontier Force, will shortly proceed to East Africa.A special organization to deal with upkeep of the overseas force and recruitingfor internal security in Nigeria is well in hand, and a similar organization for theGold Coast is under consideration. In addition to and indepen den (ly of this, Colonel.Hay wood, R.A., has been appointed Assistant-Director of Recruiting and has now reached the West Coast, charged with the duty of visiting the West African colonies and protectorates and undertaking such recruiting as may be possible. His reports are awaited before further steps are taken. Nigeria has, however, already beendrained to safety point to provide the overseas contingent. A special attempt is being made to send 2,000 recruits as reinforcements, but it seems doubtful if theywill be obtained within six months. Specially qualified officers with Nigerianexperience have had to bft recalled from France and other theatres of war in seriouslylarge numbers to provide officers for the contingent and to form recruiting parties.Recruiting on the Gold Coast is by no means easy, and the greatest difficulty is atpresent being experienced in finding suitable material for reinforcements for the overseascontingent.13. Other dependencies (Tables VII., VIII. and IX.) Gibraltar. The civil population are technically camp followers and are not suitablefor military service.A local Volunteer force exists and a certain number of civilians are serving withthe Royal Garrison Artillery in subordinate positions to replace trained men sent home for service elsewhere.Malta. A Labour Battalion (1,000 strong) is now at Salonika.The Royal Malta Artillery and two infantry battalions form part of the garrison of malta.Cyprus. Muleteers are being recruited for service at Salonika and it is hoped toobtain 3,000 of them.Hong Kong, Ceylon, Mauritius, Seychelles. -All available white males havealready volunteered. Hong Kong and Ceylon are undertaking local defence, soreleasing the Indian infantry battalions. As regards black and coloured populationsin Ceylon and Mauritius, it would be impossible to form fighting units of an)&apos;value,owing to the tribes not belonging to fighting; classes and to the difficulty of furnishingsuitable officers. It would seem that they would best be used as labour units oremployed as munition workers.The Government of Hong Kong proposes to raise some troops for combatantpurposes as soon as the question of raising labour forces in China is settled.In the Seychelles a carrier corps is being formed for service in East Africa and some600 have recently arrived there.West Indies, Bermuda, Honduras and British Guiana. A British West IndiesContingent has been formed, absorbing only a small proportion of the colouredpopulation. They have not been well reported on by General Officer Commanding-in Chief, Egypt, as first line troops, but have done satisfactorily as ammunitioncarriers and among the personnel of heavy batteries in France. Steps are being takento raise further battalions for these purposes and as line of communication troops.14. Recommendations. In regard to tbo forces of the self-governing Dominions,the Army Council make the following recommendations : (i.) That the Commonwealth Government be urged to take steps at once for theformatin of a sixth Australian division.
(ii.) That the Government of New Zealand be urged to undertake at once theformation of a second New Zealand division.(hi.) That the Government of Canada be urged to agree to send the fifth division toFrance as soon as it can be completed to establishment, less its artillery,and when its training is sufficiently advanced, and further to examine thepossibility of raising a sixth division.Should it subsequently be found in the case of any of the above that sufficientreinforcements are not forthcoming to maintain an increased number of divisions in thefield the new formations can be used to provide drafts ; or, as an alternative, the infantryof divisions can be reduced to nine battalions.15. The Council further recommend that instructions be issued to His Majesty&apos;bHigh Commissioner in Egypt to take immediate step&apos;; to raise three new Egyptianbattalions, with a view to releasing three fully trained Soudanese or Arab battalions for service in Egypt, so that the latter can be placed at Sir Archibald Murray&apos;s disposal not later than the 1st August next.In view of the Sirdar&apos;s statement that there is great difficulty in maintaining theexisting Soudanese battalions at all under present conditions, and also of the additionalgarrisons rendered necessary by the recent acquisition of territory, the Council are ofopinion that the whole question of voluntary enlistment in the Soudan should be examined with a view to ascertaining whether it could not be stimulated by the offer of increased inducements. Should this prove to be the case, the Council recommend thata-brigade of four Arab or Soudanese battalions be formed for employment in Egypt.R. H.

In such a casethe 25 per cent. &quot;A&quot; menestimate will naturally be far short of the actualfigure, looking to thefact that recruits underthis headin r are all ob-obtaiued from a sourcewhich is practicallywholly composed of selected lives.Notes. 1. Figures for Great Britain show that the proportion of men aged from18 to 41, both inclusive, who are fit to be placed in Category &quot; A,&quot; is about 25 per cent,of the total male population, while the number of men of the same age fit for other military services is approximately 15 per cent. These percentages have been used as abasis for above.2. No account has been taken of Imperial Reservists called to the regular army.These may be reckoned approximately as 5,000 each for South Africa and Canada, and less for Australia and New Zealand.3. Above estimates are probably on low side for following reasons : (a.) The age distribution in the Dominions may be expected to differ considerably from that of the Mother Country. There will be proportionately a greater number of men in the prime of life in the Dominions.(6.) A very considerable portion of the population in the Dominions is composed of emigrants from Great Britain, who are for the most part of very good,physical fitness, e.g., in the case of some of the Dominions men sufferingfrom diseases such as tuberculosis, &amp;c, are not permitted to land.

&quot; THIS MOST PAINFUL POSITION.&quot;1. New Zealand&apos;s Part in the War.A Plain-spoken Appeal.&quot; Formerly our contribution to tlie external defence was nothing but one-twelfth of our fair share of thecost of the British Navy. Now we piy a less proporti uate share, to the Navy, and we sand only onesoldier to every two sent by Britain and we pay nothing to the general expenses of the war. Thus, despite the sacrifices we have made, we lean on our British relatives and friends for much over half of our defence.Their politeness and our distance away conceal this mo t painful position..&quot; I venture lo say each one of us, if here, would vehemently desire as I do, to support the Governmentin completely fulfilling their self-reliant policy, and that of nO years ago, by insisting on sending- more menand sharing all burdens from the commencement of the war. S. A. Atkinson.&quot;The above is a copy of a cablegram addressed to the Dominion from London by Mr. S. A. Atkinson, thewell-known Wellington solicitor, and now a member of our Expeditionary Force. The message speaks for itself, and will no doubt be read wish both interest and concern. We have referred to it in our editorialcolumns.2. The Dominion.(Monday, 9th October, 1916.)New Zealawfs Share.&quot; The high praise which Sir Douglas Haig has just bestowed upon the fighting qualities of the NewZealand soldiers engaged in the epic struggle which is now in progress in the Somme region should makethe heart of every man and woman in the Dominion glow with patriotic pride. We have the right to beproud of the quality of our iroops they have behaved magnificently. Recent heavy casualty lists haveassisted us to realise something of the spirit which&quot; h-ss inspired thes &apos; men, and it is partly because ofthis that wo would direct special attention lo the message which we publish this morning, addressed to us from London by Mr. S. A. Atkinson. Mr. Atkinson is now a member of our Expeditionary Force.Before he enlisted he was well-known here as an eneigetic advocate of more vigorous and extensivemilitary measun-s. He urged again and again that the number of our reinforcements should be increased.Now that he has got to the centre of affairs, he is more convinced than ever that New Zealand shouldbe aroused to a truer idea of her w ir responsibilities. He thinks the present position is not creditableto the Dominion, and, in the light of the facts he mentions, few will care to dispute his view. How can itbe creditable to New Zealand that,&apos;oh a proportional basis, Britain should have put two soldiers in thefield for every one that New Zealand has sent to the front? And on the subject of the Navy, also,Mr. Atkinson speaks plainly, and we think convincingly. If any of us has ever had any doubts as towhether the Empire is getting good value for the money spent on the Navy, the war has effectuallydispelled them. It is quite impossible to over estimate the debt, which New Zealand owes to His Majesty&apos;sship3 and sailors. To no part of the Empire is sea power of more vital importance than it is to us.But the Empire&apos;s naval supremacy can only he maintained at, great cost; and we are not bearing anything likeour fair share of the expense. As Mr. Atkinson reminds us, our contribution is only equal to about one- twelfth ofour proportional share of the expenditure as it stood prior to the commencement of the war. In 1887 our contribution was fixed at 20,0007. a year. In 19(18 it was raised to 1 a sum not exceeding 40,000/.&apos; In1908 we agreed to pay 100,000/. a year. It must be plain to everyone that the amount we fay is quiteinsignificant when compared with the value we receive, in die shape of naval defence, is it right that weshould continue to enjoy the protection of the Navy, upon which all that we have and are depends, withoutaccepting a fair share of the sacrifice which its upkeep entails ? The present position should be regarded asintolerable by any self-respecting State. The. Minister of Defence has stated that the whole question ofnaval defence will have to be reconsidered. It is a matter of men as well as money. It will have to bedealt with as an essential part of the general problem of reorganizing the Empire for defence purposes naval and military. New Zealand knows that she ought to do more for the maintenance of the Navy than she has done in the past. And her people are quite willing to do more when their leaders show the way.But what of the present ? The successful prosecution of die war means as much to us as it does to the mother Country-perhaps more. The only question we should really consider is: Are we doing all that wecan to ensure that full and complete victory that Mr. Heidman spoke of on Saturday night in his admirableaddress before the Orphans&apos; Ulub? Obviously we are not. Mr. Atkinson, a New Zealander himself, one ofthose who made great sacrifices to go to the front, to serve his country, and who has seen something of, andbeen immensely impressed by, the sacrifices that are being made by the people of Great Britain, tells us onlythe plain truth in his message to-day. We have done a great deal, but we can and should do more. Wecan begin by sending more men.&quot;Appendix (A).
