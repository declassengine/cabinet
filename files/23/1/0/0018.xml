-L^l^^QgM6^..^.^?.....Property of His Britannic ^^est^ Goyeniment.]Printed for the use of the Cabinet.   December 1916.SECRET. . /&apos; ;    52[To be returned to the Secretary, 2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.JWAR CABINET, 18.Minutes of a Meeting of the War Cabinet held at 10, Downing Streett on Tuesday,December 26, 1916, at 1T30 a.m.Present:,      The Prime Minister (in the Chair\The Right Hon. the Earl Curzon of kedleston, K.G., G.C.S.I., G.C.I.E.The &quot;Right Hon. the Viscount Milner,G.C.B., G.C.M.G.The Right Hon. A. Bonar Law, M.P.In attendance:Lieutenant-Colonel Sir M. P. A. Hankey, K.C.B., Secretary.Major C. L. Storr, Assistant Secretary.Captain L. S. Amery, M.P., Assistant Secretary.roumania : De-struction of corn.Attended for thissubject:General Sir W. E.Robertson, C.I.G.S.I. THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff referred to theexcellent work done by Lieutenant-Colonel Norton-Griffiths indestroying the wells and machinery before certain Roumanianoilfields fell into the hands of the enemy. He wished to know what were the orders of the War Cabinet in regard to the destruction of roumanian corn, of which there were large stocks at Braila and elsewhere.The War Cabinet, notwithstanding the apprehensions of theBritish Minister accredited to Roumania, that the wholesaledestruction of wheat would gravely affect public opinion in that country (Sir G. Barclay&apos;s telegram No. 68, datedthe 23rd December, 1916), confirmed the Conclusion ofthe late War Committee (W.C.-80, paragraph 4) in favourof the destruction of Roumanian supplies of oil and wheat,and decided that every effort must be made to destroyexisting stocks of corn, or otherwise prevent them from- falling into hostile possession. They regarded this action as the more necessary owing to the possibility, whichcannot be excluded, of Braila being occupied by theenemy.
2Peace Proposals:The Question ofReplies to be sentto American andGerman Notes.Attended for thissubject:Lord Robert Cecil,Foreign Office.2. The War Cabinet had before them certain documents, viz.,the draft French reply to the German Note and Lord Robert Cecil&apos;note, &quot; Proposed Action in regard to American Note &quot; (printed as appendices I and II to War Cabinet, 10), and also the draft Frenchreply to the American Note (printed as Appendix I to these Minutes),relating to the overtures for peace by the President of the UnitedStates of America, following upon (chronologically, but, as stated by President Wilson, not in consequence of) the German note onthe subject.Lord Robert Cecil stated that he had that morning discussed the Notes with the American Ambassador in London, who had urged the desirability of complete frankness in dealing with thequestion, not only so far as he and Mr. Page were concerned, butalso as between the two Governments. Mr. Page had informed him that there was, in his own country, a very limited appreciation ofwhat was involved in the war, and of the spirit in which it wasbeing carried on by the Entente Powers.The War Cabinet concurred in the view that frankness was desirable, and debated whether it was advisable that the allies should submit separate answers to the Notes, or whether theirreplies should take an identic form. They agreed provisionally thatit was undesirable that each Entente Power should formulate its ownterms of peace. At the same time they recognised that, in favour ofthe transmission of separate replies, was the fact that convincingappeals in the name of humanity, for restitution and reparation,such as could be made by the smaller States of Serbia and Belgium,could not fail to exercise a powerful effect upon the sympathies of neutral countries.The final decision of the War Cabinet was deferred, pending a discussion of the question by the British and french ministers at the Conference to be held in London that afternoon.Conference ofFrench and british ministers inLondon.Attended in conncc-tion with minutes, 4, 5, and 6 :General Sir W. R.Robertson,C.I.G.S.3. The Secretary stated that just before the meeting he had seen M. de Fleuriau, Counsellor at tbe French Embassy in London,who had informed him that the subjects the French Ministers, whohad arrived that morning, wished to discuss at the conference in the afternoon were : (a.) The replies to be sent to the German and American notes.(b.) The situation in Greece.(c.) The extension of the British line on the Western front.(d.) Finance.Lord Robert Cecil said that he understood the French repre-sentatives also desired to discuss Salonica (in particular) and palestine.The Chief of the Imperial General fcjtaff pointed out that twoitems on the above agenda were military questions, and that neitherthe French Minister of War nor any military officer accompanied the French delegates ; and, further, that the question of the extensionof the British line in France was essentially a matter for the Britishand French Commanders-in-chief on the spot.Military Policy inthe Balkans.4. The War Cabinet had before them the following documents : (1.) A  communication   from    General   Joffre,    dated   the22nd December, 1910 (Appendix II).(2 ) A telegram from General Milne, dated the 22nd December,1916 (Appendix III).(3.) A letter from General Dessino, the Military Representativeof Russian General Headquarters.
Salonica port facilities.Attended in connec-tion with minutes, 6, 7, 8, and 9 :Sir j. Maclay, con-troller of Ship-ping.Admiral Sir J. R.Jellicoe, First sea lord.Mr. Graeme Thom-son (acting B. ofT.), Admiralty.5. The remarks of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff withreference to the breakdown of sea transport gave rise to a discussion on the port arrangements at Salonica, and on shipping questionsgeneraHy. Mr. Graeme Thomson, in connection with the first point, read out a report from Mr. Palmer stating that the real difficulty was the delay in moving away the material after it waslanded, and suggesting that the adoption of Sir F. Dent&apos;s proposalsfor moving the goods from the docks by rail and not by motorlorries, the taking over of the Greek customs quay, and of certainGreek lighters, would enable the British sector of the port to cope with four or five more divisions, and to render some assistance tothe French sector. While urging the adoption of Sir F. Dent&apos;sproposals, &quot;Mr. Graeme Thomson made it clear that delays at salonica were only a subsidiary feature, the main problem being that of finding the shipping required.It was decided by the War Cabinet that the War Office should- carry out Sir F. Dent&apos;s proposals without delay.Shipping: Despatchof Troops to salonica.6. On the question of shipping troops to Salonica, Mr. GrasmeThomson explained that there was no impossibility in sending anyrequired number of divisions, though there might be three or fourThe Chief of the Imperial General Staff made a statement tothe War Cabinet, the gist of which is given in Appendix TV.with  reference to Minute 1 of&quot; the 23rd December, (WarCabinet 17), the War Cabinet were of opinion that the question ofthe military policy to be adopted depended largely on the danger ofGerman penetration into Greece.     The Chief  of the ImperialGeneral Staff expressed the opinion that, if the Allied force at salonica were withdrawn from Monastir to a second position in theneighbourhood of Lake Ostrovo, it would be dangerous for theGermans to attempt to send any considerable force into Greece withthe menace of a force of twenty-three divisions on their flank.   he considered that General Sarrail might incur undue risk in trying tohold his present position, though he did not urge retirement from ittill it was certain that the enemy were really coming in force.   Sofar the evidence was rather that they were continuing their concen-tration in Moldavia.   He was opposed to sending more troops to the balkans, even Italian troops, if they were available, because the balkan theatre was one in which the enemy&apos;s means of communicationwere greatly superior to our own.   As it Avas, sea transport hadlargely broken down.   He had had a number of heavy batteriesand 10,000 drafts waiting to go to Salonica since the 2nd December,15,000 drafts were waiting for Egypt and elsewhere in the East,while 5,000 more drafts were ready for Salonica as soon as shippingcould be found, and there had been delay in guns going to France.The War Cabinet, with reference to Sir William Robertson&apos;sstatement, insisted that the mistake of a half-hearted compromise between different policies favoured by the several Entente Powers,must not be repeated, and that a definite decision should be come to between the three alternatives of : (1.) Complete abandonment of the Balkans.(2.) Retention of the present line.(3.) Retirement to a safer intermediate line.It was pointed out that the retirement contemplated in thethird alternative was in the French sector, and that General Sarrailwas resolved not to retire.
weeks&apos; delay in fitting more ships. The real difficulty was that itcould only be done at the expense of other urgently requiredservices.The War Cabinet decided that the despatch to Salonica of thebatteries and of the 10,000 drafts referred to by Sir William Robertson, and. of an additional 5,000 draft, should have priority over all other shipping arrangements, except thatno arrangements already made for the shipping of coal toItaly should be cancelled without formal reference to theWar Cabinet. Mr. Graeme Thomson estimated that hecould get the troops in question to Salonica in about amonth.Mr. Graeme Thomson and Sir Joseph Maclay were also instructedto work out, if possible in time for the conference with theFrench Ministers on the afternoon of the 26th December,, ascheme for the despatch to Salonica of the two french divisions which have been waiting for ships.Coal for Italy. 7. The First Sea Lord explained that five colliers had now beenassigned to the Italian coal traffic, in addition to 50,000 tonsdiverted from the British fleet in the Mediterranean, and 15,000tons which the French had been persuaded to give up.British Shipstrading betweenNeutral Countries.8. Mr. Graeme Thomson explained that not less than 150British ships were still engaged in the distant trades, many of thembetween neutral countries, as, e.g., between North and SouthAmerica. The Controller of Shipping was instructed to withdrawthese ships, carrying out the arrangements already begun accordingto the information given to the War Committee on the 23rdNovember by the late President of the Board of Trade (Yv\C.-*$l,Conclusion .7, Appendix].!).Shipping employedby the liquor traffic.9. The Controller of Shipping reported that 50 ships werelocked up in importing brewing and distilling material of a volumeof 1,300,000 tons per annum, of which only 300,000 tons were inany sense used as foodstuffs, and urged the issuing of instructionsto excise officers not to allow any imported material to be used forbrewing or distilling. Sir Joseph Maclay was asked to discuss thematter with the Food Controller and the President of the Board ofAgriculture, and to ascertain more fully what proportion of thematerial employed in brewing and distilling was still available, asurged by the trade, as foodstuffs.(Initialled) D.

Draft Reply prepared by M. Briand to the German Note.Les Gouvernements allies, unis pour la defense de la liberte des peuples; etfideles a 1&apos;engagernent pris de ne pas deposer isolement les armes, ont resolu derepondre collectivement aux pretendues propositions de paix qui leur ont eteadressees de la part des Gouvernements ennemis par les intermediaires de plusieursPuissances neutres.Avant toute reponse, les Puissances de 1&apos;Entente tiennent a s&apos;elever bautementcontre deux bases essentielles de la note allemande qui pretend rejeter sur les Allies laresponsabilite de la guerre, et qui proclame la victoire des Puissances centrales.Les Allies n&apos;admettront jamais une affirmation doublement mensongere, et quisuffirait a frapper de sterilite toute tentative de negociation.Les Puissances de 1&apos;Entente subissent depuis trente mois une guerre qu&apos;elles onttout fait pour eviter.Elles ont demontre par des actes leur attacbement a la paix. Cet attacbementest aussi ferme aujourd&apos;hui qu&apos;en l&apos;.*14.Mais elles estiment, qu&apos;apres lagression allemande, couronnement caleule d&apos;unelongue premeditation materielle et morale, apres la violation des engagements lesplus solennels et de toutes les lois internationales, ce n&apos;est pas sur la parole delAllemagne que la paix peut etre fondee, car c&apos;est l&apos;allemagne qui l&apos;a rompue.Une suggestion sans conditions pour 1&apos;ouverture de negociations n&apos;est pas uneoifre de paix. La pretendue proposition, depourvue de substance et de precision, mise en circulation par le Gouvernement Imperial, apparait moins comme une offre de paixque comme une manoeuvre de guerre.Elle est basee sur la meconnaissance systematique du caractere de la lutte dans lepasse, dans le present et dans 1&apos;avenir.Pour le passe, la note allemande ignore les faits, les dates, les chiffres, quietablissent que la guerre a ete voulue, provoquee, declaree par 1&apos;Allemagne et1&apos;Autricke.   Aucun doute ne subsiste cependant a cet egard dans aucun pays neutre.A La Haye c&apos;est le delegue allemand qui avait refuse systematiquement touteproposition de desarmement. En juillet 1914, c&apos;est rAutriche-Hongrie, qui, apres avoiradresse a la Serbie un ultimatum sans precedent, lui a declare la guerre, malgre lessatisfactions immediates obtenues.Les Empires du Centre ont alors repousse toutes les tentatives faites par les Alliespour assurer a un confLit local une solution pacifique. L&apos;offre de conference del&apos;Angleterre, la proposition francaise de Commission internationale, la demanded&apos;arbitrage de 1&apos;Empereur de Russie a 1&apos;Empereur dAllemagne, 1&apos;entente realisee entrela Russie et l&apos;autriche la veille du conflit, tout ces efforts ont ete laisses par TAUemagnesans reponse ou sans suite. La Belgique a ete envahie par un Empire qui avait garantisa neutralite et qui, dans 1&apos;ivresse de la premiere heure, a proclame lui-meme que lestraites etaient des &quot; chiffons de papier &quot; et que &quot; necessite n&apos;a pas de loi.&quot;Pour le present, les pretendues off res de PAllemagne s&apos;appuient sur une *&apos; carte de guerre&quot; qui n&apos;exprime que 1&apos;apparence exterieure et passagere de la situation, non laforce reelle des adversaires. Une paix conclue en partantde cesdonnees annulerait lesefforts accomplis et les resultats obtenus par YEntente, tant au point de vue effectifquau point de vue materiel, depuis le debut des hostilites. Elle serait a 1&apos;avantageunique des agresseurs, qui, ayant cru atteindre le but en deux mois, s&apos;aper9oivent apresdeux ans qu&apos;ils ne 1&apos;atteindront jamais.Pour 1&apos;avenir, les mines causees par la declaration de guerre allemande, lesattentats innombrables commis depuis trente mois par 1&apos;Allemagne contre lesbelligerants et contre les neutres exigent des sanctions et des garanties militaires,politiques et economiques. L&apos;Allemagne elude les unes et les autres. Mais lesPuissances de 1&apos;Entente veulent rendre impossible le renouvellement d&apos;une pareilleagression : il faut que la, restitution soit complete ; il faut que la reparation soitentiere ; il faut que les garanties soient effectives.Pour ces raisons 1&apos;ouverture faite par 1&apos;Allemagne, qui ne comporte aucuneprecision et n&apos;en pouvait pas comporter, est jugee par les Puissances de 1&apos;Entente, noncomme un effort sincere en vue de faciliter une paix durable, mais comme une rusecaleulee en vue d&apos;agir sur revolution de la guerre et d&apos;imposer finalement une paixallemande.       *
Elle a pour objet:De troubler l&apos;opinion publique clans les pays allies. Cette opinion, malgre lesfatigues et les sacrifices, a deja repondu avec une fermete admirable et evente le piegeque laisse voir le vide de la declaration ennemie ;De raffermir 1&apos;opinion publique de 1&apos;Allemagne et de ses Allies. L&apos;efi&apos;ort supremeet ecrasant que nos adversaires exigent de leurs peuples, si gravement eprouves dejapar leurs pertes de guerre, uses par les rebserrements economiques dont ils souffrent,explique cette tentative et lui donne tout son sens ;De tromper et meme intimider 1&apos;opinion publique des pays neutres fixee depuissur les responsabilites initiates, eclairee sur les responsabilites presentes et tropclairvoyante pour favoriser les desseins de 1&apos;Allemagn&apos;e en abandonnant la defense deslibertes burnaines ;De tenter de justifier d&apos;avance aux yeux du monde les nouveaux crimes qmelleprepare : guerre sous-marine, deportations, travaux et enrolements forces de nationscontre leur propre pays, violations de neutralite.Tel est le piege auquel les Gouvernements et les peuples de 1&apos;Entente ref usent dese laisser prendre. Certains, aujourd&apos;hui comme hier, de travailler a retablir la paix,rompue malgre eux et contre eux, ils livrent cette manoeuvre au jugement deThumanite.Cest en pleine conscience de la gravite, mais aussi des necessites, de Theure queles Gouvernements allies, etroitement unis entre eux, et en parlaite communion avecleurs peuples, se refusent a faire etat cTune proposition sans sincerite et sans portee.Ils affirment une fois de plus qu&apos;odieusement attaques ils pouisuivront la luttejusqu&apos;a ce que soient assurees la reparation des droits et des libertes violes. la reprisede tous les territoires envahis, la libre existence des petites nationalites, dans 1&apos;equilibrepacifique organise et garanti, d&apos;une Europe soustraite aux convoitises brutales dumilitarisme prussien.Ambassade de France, Londres,le     decembre, 1916.Telegram from Lord Bertie to Lord Hardinge, dated December 22, 1916.(Urgent and Private.)   K.Draft answer to German Peace Note which was telegraphed yesterday forconcurrence of His Majesty&apos;s Government was a combination of several drafts, twoby M Jules Cambon, two by M. Margerie, and three by ii. Berthelot, who draftedcombination [group unclecypherable].M. Cambon did not have any opportunity of speaking to M. Briand on the final draft until this morning, when he deprecated to him some of the expressions in it as not befitting a diplomatic note, though they might be permissible in a new-spaperarticle or in a speech. Expressions particularly mentioned to me this morning byM. Cambon as objectionable in draft which he showed to me are (end of K)&quot; mensongere,&quot; &quot; pas sur la parole de TAllemagne que la paix peut etre fondee,&quot; and&quot; odieusement attaquees.&quot;(K\ lie told me that M. Briand said that he would strike out such expressions, ifobjected to by His Majesty&apos;s Government. Ah Cambon hopes therefore thatMr. Balfour will take exception to them.Final paragraph appears to me to be embarrassing to us in the future in regardto our retention of conquered German colonies..
Situation in Saxontca.Telegram from General Joffre to Chief of the Imperial General. Staff,dated the 22nd December, 1916.I HAVE the honour to hand over to your Excellency the following telegram,which I received from General Joffre : &quot; In my telegram dated the 7th December I have expressed to general sir William Robertson my inmost conviction that the Armee d&apos;Orient is threatened by a joint attack of the Germans and Bulgarians from the north and of the Greek forces from the south. To meet such a danger, I made an urgent appeal that theBritish forces should be brought to a strength of nine divisions and the Italian forces to that of five divisions.&quot; This proposition not having been accepted by our Allies, France alone hasconsented the effort which I consider indispensable, and has decided to send two more divisions to Salonica.&quot; Further facts disclose now the hostile intentions of Greece : &quot;(a.) General Gourko reports as a fact that the Greeks have an understanding with the enemy in view of co-operating with him.&quot; (6.) He informs me that, owing to the necessity of rebuilding the RoumanianArmy before sending it back to the front, and to the difficulty which thecondition of railroads in Roumania creates for the concentration of sufficient forces, he considers it likely that the Armee d&apos;Orient will haveto face alone during a long period the German and Greek attack beforethe Russo-Roumanian Army is ready to assume the offensive.&quot; (c.) The Kaiser has sent by wireless to the Queen of Greece a cypher messagepromising help from Germany for the combined operations against theArmee d&apos;Orient.&quot; (d.) General Sarrail is of opinion that it is only the fact that the Greek Army isnot ready and the Germans still at a considerable distance, which prevents Greece from opening hostilities against him.&quot; A withdrawal from Mouastir by the Armee d&apos;Orient, if the latter is compelled todo so, would enable the Germans to join hands with the Greeks, and accordingly makeit possible :  &quot; (a.) To stiffen and reorganise the Greek Army.&quot; (b.) To use all the Greek ports as bases for submarines, thus cutting off Salonicaand Eastern Mediterranean.&quot; (c.) To drive back the Italian corps in the region of Valona.&quot; (d.) To keep the Armee d&apos;Orient invested with reduced Bulgarian and Greek forces only, thus recuperating German forces.&quot; Such action would not only completely forbid in the future any combinedoffensive by the Russo-Roumanian Armies and the Armee d&apos;Orient, but also mark the definite failure of the plans of the Allies in the Balkans&quot;For the above reason, I feel strongly that Great Britain and Italy ought to reconsider their decision, and I emphatically insist on their sending the Divisions Ihave previously asked for and which are now, in my opinion, more necessary than ever.&quot; France has already made the largest possible effort considering the shippingpossibilities of her mercantile marine On account of the urgent need of reinforce-ments, all means of transportation ought to be made use of, and an agreement reachedto that effect.&quot;The despatch of Italian forces should preferable be made over Santi Quaranta,so as : &quot; (a.) To effectively cover the road between that landing place and Monastir, thuskeeping a safe line of communications for the Armee d&apos;Orieht.&quot; (6.) To cut off entirely Greece from the two Austrian Divisions in Albania.&quot; Please transmit the above telegram to Sir William Robertson, to whom I shouldbe most obliged if he let me have an answer as soon as possible.&quot; The Italian commander-in-Chief has been informed to the same effect.&quot;(Signed.)      JOFFRE.D
From General Officer Commanding, Salonica, to C.I.G.S.December 22, 1916, 11*45 p.m.G.C. 275.       . .  .   ,I UNDERSTAND that Sarrail is expressing himself as being extremely dissatisfied,with the diplomatic&apos;action which is being taken at Athens, and considers the resultsasked for are inadequate to safeguard the rear of the army, and that the King of greece is temporising pending the arrival of the Germans. He is talking of takingthe matter into his own hands, and it appears to me that his desire is to effect a rupture with the Greeks, whom he wishes to attack before any Germans can concentrate on our front. Such action is now, in my opinion, ont of the question, having regard tothe future and to the troops at our disposal, but I should be glad to be informed of thepolicy of His Majesty&apos;s Government.APPENDIX IV (vide Minute 4).SALONICA is one long story of the British Government acting against its betterjudgment in the interest of the other Allies, and of being impelled thereby to reject theadvice of the British General Staff. %In October 1915 the French persuaded us to send troops to Salonica in order to save Serbia. The British General Staff definitely stated at the time that Serbia couldnot be saved, as the troops would arrive too late. General Joffre threatened to resignunless the troops were sent, and the British Government gave in.Early in the present year we endeavoured to get away some of the troops as there were more than were needed for the defence of Salonica, but again we werepersuaded by the French on the plea that our presence at Salonica would bring inthe Greeks.Later we were again persuaded to remain there in order to bring in Roumania,with the result that more than a quarter of a million men were locked up in Salonicafor the first half of this year doing practically nothing.Roumania was brought in, with the result known, arid early in October we were again persuaded by the French Government to send more troops in order to saveRoumania, and although this was not objected to by the General Staff, because ofpolitical reasons, it was pointed out that Roumania could not possibly be saved oreven assisted by this means as the troops would arrive too late, and even if not they could do little or nothing to assist Roumania. Events have proved this to be true, as the French have only jnst completed landing one of the two divisions they undertook to send and still have a very large number of drafts waiting to go out.We also have a large number of drafts still waiting to-go.On every occasion the advice given by General Joffre has proved to be wrongand that given by the British General Staff has proved to be right.As regards the strategical aspect, it is impossible for us to compete with our sea communications against the German land communications. Germany can put intoMacedonia, either from the East or West front, divisions at the rate of about two aweek. The Entente cannot put them there at the rate of two a month. Our sea communications have, in fact, already broken down, and it is folly to talk of sendingmore divisions unless sea transport can be greatly accelerated and increased. Sincethe beginning of this month we have had three heavy batteries and 10,000 draftswaiting to go to Salonica, and they are still waiting; and new heavy guns for Franceare going out much slower than they are made ready to go.Joffre&apos;s Conduct Peculiar from First.-At the Chantilly Conference, Joffre statedthat no more than 23 divisions could be employed in the Macedonian theatre. Thereare now 20tj there and 3 more French divisions are under orders, making 23^-; andhe wishes for us to send 2 more and the Italians to send 3-g-, making 29, in order tohold the present line.I wrote to General Joffre on the 2nd instant and pointed out the precarious positionof the troops. He did not answer my letter for a week, and then deprecated anywithdrawal and talked of the Russians and ourselves continuing the offensive.   Later
he agreed that our offensive must temporarily be suspended and that we should beprepared to occupy a shorter line in case of necessity, whereas now he wishes moretroops to go in order to enable us to hold the present line.With regard to General Gurko, he has telegraphed this week saying we ought to reinforce Salonica in order to safeguard ourselves in Mesopotamia and Egypt. He hastelegraphed to Cadorna saying that he ought to reinforce Salonica in order tosafeguard his position in Italy; and now he writes that everybody should reinforceSalonica in order that a decisive result may be sought in the Balkans.Every division sent to Salonica means a reduction in our chances of obtaining afavourable decision on the west front in 1917 ; sea transport, as I understand it,cannot compete with any larger number of divisions at Salonica; even if we couldsend them we could merely act on the defensive, as we should not be strong enough totake a decisive offensive; and never can be in comparison with what the enemycan do.We can no longer afford to continue sinking men, or trying to sink them, there,and I think that the time has now come when the Cabinet really must act according toits own judgment.&quot; My advice is the same as given on the 9th instant.December 23, 1916.printed at the foreign office by c. r. harrison.-30/12/1916.
