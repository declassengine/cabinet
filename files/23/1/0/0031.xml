R.Robertson, Chiefof the ImperialGeneral Staff.Admiral Sir J. R.Jellicoe, first sea Lord of theAdmiralty.s 1. The Prime Minister gave the War Cabinet an account of therecent Conference of the Allies at Rome. A summary of his statement is reproduced in Appendix I.2. With reference to paragraph 3 of the Conclusions of the.Rome Conference (War Cabinet, I.C. 15), the Prime Ministerreported that he had made it clear to General Sarrail that, owing tothe shipping difficulty, it was out of the question to send any british reinforcements to Salonika beyond drafts already waiting to go. The question of sending further Italian troops had also not been pressed. It was generally realised at the conference that any question of reinforcing the Army at Salonika had tobe postponed to the improvement of the means of communicationbehind the Salonika front and to the Balkans.
Transport of Troops,to Macedoniathrough Italy.3. Lord Derby reported that preliminary investigation showed that there was no difficulty as regards the actual running throughof trains from Cherbourg to Brindisi and Taranto. This would not interfere with the traffic on our front, and the other French lines,notwithstanding the increased traffic to which the Board of trade had referred in a Memorandum, could cope with the additionaltransit, which, from the figures given at the Conference, couldbe at least 4,000 troops a day as far as the Italian railways were concerned. The real difficulty was in shipping rolling-stock acrosstheChannel. Approximately another 150 locomotives, 1,000 passengercars, and 5,000 trucks would be required, and we were not in a position at present to get across the rolling-stock required for our own front in France.Proposed offensive on Italian Front.4. The Prime Minister explained that the troops transportedthrough Italy would be sent from Brindisi to Santi Quaranta andItea, and from Taranto to Salonika. As regards the route fromSanti Quaranta to *Monastir, the Italians had agreed to put 2,000engineers at work repairing it, while M. Thomas had offered to find1,000 motor lorries to deal with the traffic.5. With reference to paragraph 7 of the Conclusions of theConference, the Prime Minister explained that there was no bargainto assist Italy with guns. The next move was with general cadorna, who had undertaken.to submit a plan for combined actionon the Italian front for examination by the Military Advisers and governments of the Allies.Greece :Protection toVenizelists.Extension of front in France.Mesopotamia.6. With reference to paragraph 4 of the Conclusions of theConference, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointed outthat the Allied Note, which was simply an answer to the Notepresented to the Conference by the Greek Government, made no provision, for the future protection of Venizeliststhat--It was agreedNo action could be taken for the moment, but that the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs should keep the question care-fully in. view, and, if necessary, communicate with the WarCabinet.7. The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that General Nivelle had expressed a wish to meet him personally on his wayback, on the question of the extension of our front in France (seeWar Cabinet 19, Minute 1), but that he had proposed that General Nivelle and Sir Douglas Haig should come over to London together.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that apparently therewas a misunderstanding between General Nivelle and Sir Douglas Haigas to what the latter had said he could do. It was not yet certain if general Nivelle could come over as suggested. The Chief of theImperial General Staff added that he had received a communication from Sir Douglas Haig regarding the extension of the British front.The Prime Minister said that this could be considered if and when general Nivelle came to England.8. The Secretary of State for India referred to recent Turkishreinforcements in the Baghdad region. If these were proceedingtowards Kut, it was to the good, in so far as it enabled our force inMesopotamia to pull its weight. But he was apprehensive as to thepossibility of a penetration into Persia and the effect this mighthave in Afghanistan.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said his information was that these reinforcements amounted to two divisions and one
German heavy battery. He thought this was due to our recentactivity in .the Kut region. He undertook to keep the matter under careful observation.Russian Front. 9. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported a successof the Russians on the Riga front,, and that extra troops were being sent there to follow it up. On the Roumanian front, Galatz hadbeen evacuated, but the enemy had not yet succeeded in crossing the River Sereth.German Moral. 10. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that german soldiers were deserting freely in the Ancre sector. Some-thing like 150 had come in since Christmas.Russia :Change ofGovernment.separation allowances.Attended for thissubject:Mr. G. N. Barnes,Minister of Pen-sions.Mr. H. W. Forster,Financial Secre-tary, War Office.Sir Charles Harris,Assistant Finan-cial Secretary,War Office.   &apos;Mr. S. H. Lever,Financial Secre-tary to theTreasury.Man-Power andthe Director ofNational Service.11. With reference to the changes in the Russian Ministry,referred to in the newspapers of even date, the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs reported that the British Ambassador inPetrograd took so grave a view of the political situation that he,Mr. Balfour, had finally acceded to Sir G. Buchanan&apos;s urgentrequest that he might interview the Emperor in person and impress upon him the dangers involved in upsetting a Government alreadyof a moderately conservative character and thus breaking altogetherwith the Duma.12. The Cabinet had before them the report of the SpecialCommittee (Appendix II), which was adopted subject to the follow-ing modification : In the case of a wife with two or more children, the War office should take power to increase the Separation Allowance forthe children by 2s. in respect of the first child, Is. 6d. inrespect of the second and third, and Is. in respect of thefourth and subsequent children. The increases are in eachcase to cease with the 14th birthday of the child.With regard to paragraph 7 of the report, the War cabinet decided that : The. Local Government Board should be instructed to take thenecessary steps for the introduction of a Bill as soon as parliament meets.13. With reference to Conclusion 4 of the Minutes of the 14thDecember (War Cabinet, 7), the War Cabinet authorised the dissolution of the Man-Power Distribution Board as proposed by theChairman in a letter dated the 8th January, 1917 (Appendix III),and the transfer of its functions and archives to the Director of.National Service.The War Cabinet decided that :  The Director should be asked to prepare for consideration bythe War Cabinet, a statement of the operations he con-templates, the measures he believes to be necessary forsecuring co-ordination with the various Departmentsconcerned with Labour, and the powers that he will require for the purpose.The Prime Minister stated that he intended to invite theDirector to meet the Ministers concerned with Labour, including the heads of the War Office and Admiralty, for a general discussion ofthe situation.
Consultation withthe Dominionsand India.(ImperialConference.)Representationof India.Indians financial contribution tothe War.14. Consequent on Conclusion 12 of the Minutes of 1st January,.1917 (War Cabinet, 24), the War Cabinet had before them a reply from the Viceroy to the Secretary of State for India, warmlyapproving the proposal that the Native States should be represented at the forthcoming consultations with the Dominions by anadditional Assessor to the Secretary of State for India, andexpressing, on behalf of the Council, unanimous approval of Bikaniras the most suitable representative.The Secretary of State for the Colonies advised  the WarCabinet that recent indications led him to believe that when the time .came the Dominions would not resent the inclusion of a third Assessorto the Secretary of State for India, particularly  if he   was   arepresentative of the native Princes.The War Cabinet approved the appointment of the Maharajah ofof Bikanir as a third Assessor to the Secretary of State forIndia.The War Cabinet had some discussion as to the procedure tobe adopted at the forthcoming consultations with the Dominions,and decided that: The Secretary of State for the Colonies should draft an agenda paper.15. The Secretary of State for India informed the WaFCabinetthat the Government of India offered a contribution of 100 millions to the cost of the war. In order to meet the annual charge it was proposed to increase taxation and inter alia to raise the import dutyon cotton, but not to touch the excise duty.The War Cabinet decided that : (a.) Mr. Chamberlain should make enquiry of the ForeignOffice as to the possible effect of this proposal on Japan.(b.) Mr. Bonar Law should make enquiries as to the probable effect of this proposal in Lancashire.Arab Revolt:Rabegh.16. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theForeign Office (Appendix IV) with reference to a telegram of the9th January, 1917, from the High Commissioner (Appendix V).The War Cabinet decided that : The High Commissioner should be given authority to send troops to Rabegh without further reference home, if hewas satisfied with the terms of the letter and manifestoto be issued by the Sherif, as required by the WarCabinet.

97Statement of the Prime Minister ivith reference to the Conference of the Allies heldat the Consulta, Rome, on January 5, 6, and 7, 1917.THE Prime Minister reported that the success of the Conference was largely dueto the fact that unpleasant issues had not been shirked, and that they had foughtthem out hammer and tongs, till they had arrived at a definite agreement.The great crux had been the question of the treatment of Greece. Baron Sonninowas strongly anti-Yenizelist, and fought very tenaciously for his point of view. Upto the night of the 6th there was a complete division in the Conference. Themilitary and civil representatives, who had met separately, were divided, the russian and French representatives being in favour of additional reinforcements being sent.The representatives of Great Britain and Italy insisted that for reasons of transport itwas impossible to send an additional two divisions. A very eloquent appeal byM. Briand impressed the Conference, but failed to produce any agreement.On the following morning General Sarrail came to see the Prime Minister andexpounded in detail his plans for an advance on Larissa, which had been carefullythought out, as well as for dealing with any resistance by the Greek army or by bandsof reservists. He indicated that, if the Greek reservists formed guerrilla bands to resist the advance of the Allies, belligerent rights would be refused to any prisonersthat might be taken. The Prime Minister explained to General Sarrail the importanceof not taking any action which might prejudice the cause of the Allies in America,more particularly in view of the extent of our dependence on the United States for munitions and supplies, and in particular he laid stress on the bad effect which mightbe created in. America if captured Greek reservists were refused belligerent rights.He insisted that we could not agree to General Sarrail carrying out his plan except on two conditions either if the Kino- refused to agree to the declaration whichthe Allies proposed to send him, or if he agreed and subsequently refused to carryout his promise. In the latter event we could only agree to General SarraiFstaking action if we were first informed. After vigorous discussion General Sarrailfinally agreed to the Prime Ministers proposal and gave his hand on it. GeneralLyautey, the French Minister of War, disliked this agreement, and opposed itvigorously when the Conference reassembled. However, the point was carried atthe Conference.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reminded the Prime Minister thatGeneral Milne had expressed the opinion that the Salonika Force was not sufficientto undertake any operations in Greece, and he thought that General Milne meant thatto include not only present conditions, but also the alternative of war with Greece.With regard to the attitude of Greece, the Prime Minister reported that on his way through Paris he was shown secret information indicating not only movements of the Bulgarian troops on the Macedonian frontier, but also that the germans were being urged by certain Royalist Greeks to attack our force at Salonika, althoughit appeared that the Greeks would not take the risk of attacking firstAs regards the probability of the acceptance of the Allied, declaration by theGreek Government, Sir Francis Elliot was certain that it would be accepted. general sarrail was of the same opinion, but did not think that the promise would afterwardsbe carried out.After this agreement, nothing more was said to the Conference about the questionof sending two additional British divisions, nor was any strong effort made to press theItalians to send additional troops. The Conference was clearly impressed by the argument of the British representatives that the shipping was not available, and thatthe first -step to any active operations in the Balkans was the opening up of communications in the Balkans themselves, and the improvement of the land transport facilities from the Western Powers to the Balkans. In urging this point, the british representatives were greatly assisted by M. de Giers, the Russian Ambassador in rome.In order to improve the roads in the Balkans, the Conference strongly pressed theItalian representatives to supply a few thousand workmen. They were at firstsomewhat reluctant, and this led to a very vigorous appeal from M. Thomas to general cadorna, reminding him of all that France had done and had suffered for the common
cause. In the end the Italians agreed to furnish civil engineers and 2,000 labourersto improve the road from Santi Quaranta to Monastir. The French government undertook to furnish two companies of engineers, and M. Thomas, on his side,promised to supply 1,000 motor-lorries for the traffic over this road.If the communications in the Balkans were improved, it was agreed that it wouldbe possible to save a great deal of risk and a considerable amount of tonnage by sending troops to the Balkans from Brindisi and Taranto to Santi Quaranta, Itea, andalso Salonika itself, instead of sending them the whole length of the Mediterranean.The Italians considered that there would be no difficulty in transporting at least 4,000troops a day over the Italian railways for this purpose. Lord Derby informed the WarCabinet that preliminary investigation showed that there was no difficulty as far as the running through of trains from Cherbourg to Brindisi or Taranto was concerned,though an additional 150 locomotives, 1,000 passenger cars, and 5,0u0 trucks would &quot;berequired. The only difficulty and it was a most serious one was how to get the rolling stock in question.across the Channel, in view of the present shipping congestion in the Channel ports. There wras a great deal of rolling stock urgently required forour own front in France, which they were not able to get over on account of this difficulty.With regard to the proposal for an offensive by the Western Powers on theItalian front, General Cadorna had indicated that, if an advance were made, it wouldbe through Laibach towards Vienna, and not in the direction of Pola. The conference agreed that General Cadorna should prepare plans and submit them to the military advisers of the other Allies. The next step was with him. There was no bargain asto our lending British guns for the Italian front. The wdiole question of Alliedsupport to the Italians was left subject to General Cadorna&apos;s producing a defmileproposal which met with their favour. The Prime Minister mentioned that the Frenchevidently had a poor opinion of the fighting value of the Italian troops.As regards the Russian army, it was generally agreed that it was desirable to equip Russian troops on the West front and also to equip Russia, Avith heavy guns.This question was to be discussed more fully at the forthcoming Conference betweenthe French and British delegates wrho were going to Russia.The Prime Minister, on his way back from the Conference, received a message atthe French frontier that General Nivelle was anxious to see him. As he assumed thatthis was in connection with the extension of the British front in France, he consideredthat this had better be done together with General Haig, and had replied thatGeneral Nivelle and General Haig should come over to London. In this connection the Chief of the General Staff mentioned that General Haig thought that he hadfixed up a provisional extension of the British line satisfactorily with General Nivelle,but that there had been some misunderstanding. General Nivelle had apparently beenunder the impression that we would take over in any case a certain sector which general Haig was only prepared to take over if he received an additional four divisions.The Foreign Secretary drew attention to the fact that there was no mention in theAllied declaration to Greece about the future protection of Venizelists in RoyalistGreece. The Prime Minister explained that the declaration was an answer to theGreek note presented to the Conference with reference to the recent demands made bythe Allies, and did not travel beyond those demands, which dealt only with reparationand compensation to the Venizelists who had suffered injury. The question of thefuture treatment of Venizelists in Royalist Greece was one, hcwever, which wouldrequire to be carefully watched.
Separation Allowances.(Report of a Special Committee.)WE were appointed by the Prime Minister &quot; to consider whether, regard being-had, inter alia, to the increased cost of living, it is advisable to increase, generally orotherwise, the separation allowances for the families and dependants of soldiers and sailors, and, if so, to examine and report upon the proposals put forward by theAdmiralty and War Office.&quot;As the result of our enquiries, we have come to the following conclusions : 1. In our opinion, a general increase in the existing fiat rates cannot be justified,but we set out below certain cases in which we think some increase is necessary.2. In. the country districts, in spite of the increase in the cost of living, theexisting rates, generally speaking, place the family of the soldier and sailor in at least as good a position as in pre-war times.In the manufacturing areas the increased opportunities for employment go far toremove the inequality between the different areas.In both urban and rural areas women who can work have, in general, ampleopportunities for supplementing the family income by wages.3. It is undesirable in the national interests to grant an all-round increase in the flat rates because the effect would be (1.) To place an additional heavy burden on the Exchequer (estimated on thebasis of the only scheme submitted to us to amount, with the consequential increases in rates of pensions, to approximately 18,00O,00OL per annum)for which there is no sufficient justification ;(2.) To weaken existing incentives to women to work ;(3.) To force a corresponding rise in all other Government grants, pensions, and allowances.   This, in turn, would probably result in a further rise in prices.4. On the other hand, the existing rates are inadequate in certain cases. Theseare as follows : (a.) Motherless children.(b.) The case of a wufe without children or a wife with one child only who is unable to work or to obtain work near her home.(c.) The case of a wife with two or three young children who require her care andthus prevent her from working.( 1.) The case of dependants (other than wife or child) unable to work.5. As regards class (a), the motherless children, we recommend that the flat ratebe increased to 7s. for the first child and 6s. for the other children of the same familyif living with the first child, without any compulsory allotment.In the case of class (d), dependants other than wife and children, we recommendthat any supplementation of the rates should be left to the Statutory Committee.The question remains whether classes (b) and (c) should be dealt with by increasingthe flat rates, or by supplementing the existing flat rates by allowances made under regulations of the Statutory Committee.The balance of advantage seems undoubtedly to lie on the side of the latter, forthe following reasons : (a.) It would cost much less to the State.(b.) The supplementary allowances would only be given where after localinvestigation they - were found to be needed ; they would not be givenwhere they were unnecessary, or where the effect would be to deter women from working who could work.(c.) The supplementary allowances would be subject to supervision, so that itwould be possible to ensure that they were properly used, and that, e.g.,the children were getting the benefit of the allowances intended for them.6. In order to enable the Local War Pensions Committees to deal adequately withthe cases above referred to, the Regulations of the Statutory Committee should be[1365-31] D
revised. The object of the increased grants would be to enable the wife to maintainher home and children in a reasonable standard of comfort. In ascertaining what, ifany, addition is required for the purpose, the Local War Pensions Committees shouldbe authorised to take into account all relevant facts at the time of making their decision ; and in order to avoid undue delay the Local Committees should be given a wider discretion to deal with individual cases without reference to the StatutoryCommittee.7. The Bill which the President of the Local Government Board has prepared forconferring further powers on local authorities in connection with maternity and child welfare would enable local authorities to provide or assist in the provision of creches.The provision of such institutions would render it possible for many women, who cannot at present leave their children, to supplement their income by wages, and we desire to express the hope that the necessary powers will be obtained at the earliest opportunity.e &apos; (Signed)      WALTER 11. LONG (Chairman).AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN.RHONDDA.SAM H. LEVER.GEORGE N. BARNES.January 4, 1917.APPENDIX III.Dissolution of the Man-Power Distribution Board.Letter from the Secretary, Man-Power Distribution Board, to the Secretary, WarCabinet, dated January 8, 1917.Sir,I AM directed by Mr. Austen Chamberlain to request that the War Cabinet willtake into consideration the question of formally dissolving the Man-Power DistributionBoard forthwith and transferring the powers, obligations, and papers of that Board tothe Director-General of National Service.Mr. Chamberlain would suggest that, if the War Cabinet decide to dissolve theMan-Power Distribution Board and transfer the powers, &amp;c, to the Director-General ofNational Service, the fact should be publicly announced.I am, &amp;c.(Signed) E. A. SANDFORD FAWCETT, Secretary.APPENDIX IV.Memorandum by the Foreign Office.GENERAL WINGATE&apos;S last telegram, No. 28, is somewhat obscure; but, onconsidering the matter in connection with our telegram to him No. 19 of the8th January, I am disposed to believe that what he is anxious about is that, whenthe Sherif sends a written request for the troops and the proclamation suitable for publication to the Mohammedan world for our approval, there should be no delay atthis end. If I am right in this interpretation, Wingate is not really asking for quitesuperfluous authority to do what he has already been authorised to do; he is merelyasking that no unnecessary waste of time on our part should postpone the orders he isprepared to give.I should myself see no objection to Wingate being given authority to judge whether the Sherif is carrying out our policy or not. If this further authority weregiven him, promptitude of action would be ensured.Foreign Office, January 10, 1917.
Telegram from Sir 7?. Wingate (Cairo), January 9, 1917.I HAVE repeated to Colonel Wilson instructions contained in your telegramNo. 19 of 7th January, and directed him to inform Sherif (of) the necessity for promptcompliance with His Majesty&apos;s Governments requirements if present arrangements for despatch of British brigade to Rabegh are to be carried out.In the meantime brigade will remain at Suez, and I have arranged withCommander-in-Chief that advance part3&quot;, under General Mudge, shall not start forRabegh pending further instructions from me.So far as I can judge, nature of Sherif&apos;s assurances will be dependent on needs ofthe moment, and unless immediate military situation of Arab forces is unfavourablethere may be further procrastination on his part. If, however, Sherif&apos;s assurances areforthcoming at once and are satisfactory, I beg that sanction of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to despatch of brigade may be sent to me as soon as possible.Information regarding Hedjaz affairs is normally conflicting and frequentlyinadequate, but salient fact remains, namely, that there is, in a military sense, no serious obstacle to a Turkish advance on Rabegh, in the course of next few weeks, or until Hedjaz railway is permanently destroyed.o
