With reference to the decision of the War Cabinet in minute 3 of the 19th December, in the sense that the Foreign office should telegraph to the Sirdar that the terms of their telegramNo. 45 of the 5th instant covered the various points raised in histelegrams Nos. 77 and 86, Lord Robert Cecil, acting for theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, called attention to the sugges-tion made by the Sirdar in the latter telegram; and asked that theWar Cabinet should decide what should be done.In the telegram referred to, dated 16th December, the Sirdarproposed to inform the Sherif that troops and their transports couldnot be detained immobile ; that therefore the Sherif must decide,,in the absence of Moslem troops, whether or not he required a european force to be landed at Rabegh in the course of the nextfortnight; that if his reply was in the negative, he must understandthat his refusal, Would be regarded as final, and that the present,offer would not be repeated:
The War Cabinet decided -That the Foreign Office should send a telegram to the Sirdar tothe effect that His Majesty&apos;s Government approved his suggestion, and that he should inform the Sherif aeproposed.2. The Secretary of State for India drew the attention of theWar Cabinet to the omission of India from the approval given forthe despatch of a telegram in the Prime Ministers name to the governors of the self-governing Dominions, in Minute 2 of theprevious day&apos;s meeting:The War Cabinet decided that Mr. Chamberlain should draft a telegram to the Viceroy in corresponding terms to that approvedby J;he Cabinet and printed in the minute quoted.3. With reference to the statement made by the Prime minister in his speech at the House of Commons on the 19th December thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government propose to summon an Imperial conference to place the whole position before the Dominions and to take counselwith them as to further action, the Prime Minister informed theCabinet that he proposed to ask the Dominions to send representa-tives as soon as possible.Mr. Chamberlain raised the question of India being represented on the Conference, and asked that His Majesty&apos;s Government wouldgive the most favourable consideration to the question when theConference was held. He pointed out the immediate and continuedcontributions of troops and war material made by India from thevery beginning of the war, and the consequent claim for repre-sentation.The War Cabinet approved in principle that India should berepresented on the Conference by the Secretary of State, accompaniedby such adjoints as each different matter might demand, butconsidered that the whole question was one of such importance that it required further discussion, and that the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies should be present.The Secretary was instructed to ask Mr. W. H. Long andMr. A. Chamberlain to draft the notification to be sent on thesubject, for discussion on Saturday, the 23rd December.4. The Chief, of the Imperial General Staff reported that hehad received satisfactory information from the Military Attache atBucharest of the destruction of the oil wells and refineries at alloil centres except two, wdiich the dispositions of the troops had now made safe. He asked that the question of compensation should stand over until the receipt of Colonel Norton Griffiths&apos;s report.He informed the Cabinet that General Sarrail had reported that hehad organised his defences in the neighbourhood of Monastir, andexpected to hold his line where he was. The whole of the BritishSixtieth Division had now arrived at Salonica except one brigadewhich had been detached to Ekaterini.o. The Prime Minister called attention to the necessity of themembers of the War Cabinet being furnished with all possible information by the responsible Departments. Among other sugges-tions as to the best means of complying with this requirement,having in view the danger of circulating several copies of secretdocuments, as well as the disadvantage of loss of time and some-times bulkiness of reports, was the institution of an &quot;informationroom&quot; in the premises presently to be occupied, where all reports and communications could be read.The War Cabinet decided that the First Sea Lord and theChief of the Imperial General Staff should carefully consider the
character of the information to he furnished by the Admiralty and war Office respectively, and should report upon the best way inwhich it could be imparted.Greece.Attended for thisSubject:Lord E. Cecil,Minister forBlockade.6. The War Cabinet had before them a telegram emanating from the King of Greece (Appendix I). After some discussion asto the terms of the acknowledgment it was decided : That the Foreign Office should send a reply to Sir FrancisElliot in the sense that, in regard to keeping Venizelistsfrom attacking royalist forces, His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwill be prepared to consider the question if the King of greece asks for it ; in order to assist the War Cabinet in considering such a request, Sir Francis Elliot should beasked for his views as to the prospect of a Venizelistrevolution taking place in Greece.In the meantime it was considered desirable that the ForeignOffice should consult with M. Stavridis and ascertain the views heldby him as prospective diplomatic agent for M. Venizelos.Guns for merchant Ships.Attended for this and remainingSubjects:Sir E.

The War Cabinet hadon the subject of the defensive armingsubmarine attack (Appendix II).The War Cabinet accepted as a basis Scheme (B), which is agreed in by the Admiralty and War Office, the effect of which onthe gun production of the Navy and Army respectively is asfollows: As regards the Army, by the sacrifice of 724 guns andhowitzers, 806 4-inch guns will be gained for the Navy.Under this scheme the Admiralty minimum requirement willnot be satisfied, at the earliest, before July 1917.It was agreed that the Admiralty and War Office shouldconcert a modification in Scheme (B) to avoid the WarOffice foregoing 196 4&quot;5-inch howitzers, in order to givethe Navy 60 4-inch guns.8. Evidence was heard as to the latest submarine losses, whichhave very seriously increased during the last few months,particularly among neutrals. The figures for these losses are shownin Appendix III.Figures were also given to show the lower percentage of lossamong ships attacked when they are armed, viz., that during thelast three months 66 per cent, of the armed merchant steamers that had been attacked had escaped.The War Cabinet re-affirmed the principle approved by the late war Committee on the loth November, 1916 : &quot;That as a question of principle the arming of merchant ships up to the number considered by the Admiralty asindispensable should be a first charge on our artilleryresources.&quot;9. It was further decided that the Ministry of Munitions, War.Office, and Admiralty should prepare, for the consideration of theWar Cabinet, at the earliest possible date a scheme for meeting therequirements of the Admiralty by April 1917.
international conference.10. An International Ministerial Conference to consider navaland shipping questions was approved in principle, to be held assoon as possible.Allocation of Ship-building Resources.Attended for thisSubject:Sir J. Maclay,Shipping Con-troller.Restriction of liquor Trade.11. As a preliminary to the holding: of the Anglo-French-Conference on the subject of guns, for merchant ships, it wasdecided that the Minister of Munitions should communicate with theFrench and Italian Ministries of Munitions, and that the&apos; First Lordof the Admiralty should communicate with the French and ItalianMinisters of Marine in order to ascertain : -(a.) The present and prospective position of the French and italians respecting the arming of merchant ships.(6.) To what extent they can respectively help us in the matter.12.a The First Lord of the Admiralty stated that the Admiralty,with other Departments concerned, was going exhaustively into thequestion of what was the best allocation of our shipbuilding resourcesbetween the different classes of warships and merchant ships.13. The War Cabinet decided to examine at an early date thequestion of curtailing the traffic in the raw materials of the LiquorTrade, with a view to reducing the volume of Shipping and railway Transport now devoted&apos; to this purpose. It was agreedthat, as a preliminary step, Lord Milner should discuss withMr. Butler (a Midland brewer) the probable effect on the brewingtrade, and should also obtain the views of Lord d&apos;abernon,Chairman of the Central Control Board (Liquor Traffic), on thesubject.Proposed financial conference withthe FrenchGovernment.14. The War Cabinet decided to invite the French Governmentto send representatives to a Conference on Finance, to be held inLondon at the earliest possible date. It was agreed that, in view ofthe Prime Minister^ recent illness and the fact that the last twoConferences have been held in France, the French GovernmentmighLreasonably be asked to come to London. In order that thequestion of finance may be discussed on the widest ground ofgeneral policy, and determined in a way that will carry the fullestauthority, it was decided to urge the importance of the french prime Minister attending in person.Postponement ofPetrogradConference.15: The War Cabinet decided that the Allies concerned shouldbe immediately informed that we are. &apos; not yet ready for the petrograd , Conference,   and   that  we   propose to postponedeparture of our representatives for26th December, the date previously fixed.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,December 20, 1916.afortnightfromthethe(Initialled)   D.

Telegram communicated from the Royal Greek Legation, London.Athens, December 3/16, 1916.YOU are requested to submit the following telegrams of His Majesty the King ofthe Hellenes to His Britannic Majesty: &quot; The new ultimatum addressed to us has again been accepted by My Govern-ment as a supreme token of the friendly feelings which we have not ceased to professtowards the Powers, and in (view) order to confirm once more the most formal andmost solemn assurances that I personally, and all the Hellenic Governments whichhave succeeded to each other, have not failed to give repeatedly as regards our sinceredesire not to depart from a friendly attitude.&quot; It is absolutely untrue that My Government, or their agents, have ever promisedor sent any support to the enemies of the Entente. On the contrary, we nave givenefficacious help to the operations of the Entente. We have four times during theEuropean war made proposals of co operation, one of which has not been accepted and the other three left unanswered.&quot; If all this has been misinterpreted, the cause is to be found in the systematiccalumnies that the unscrupulous and desperate opposition of a Statesman towards Me,have succeeded in propagating against the sincerity of My intentions.&quot;Owing to the same campaign the Powers, induced in error as to the actualdispositions of the Greek people, have stopped the constitutional life of My country.Having demanded the dissolution of the Parliament, they.have, a few weeks afterwards,presented new elections to be held, without allowing the existing House to sit again.&quot; The recent events are the result of a violent revolutionary movement, which hasbroken out at Athens on the 1st December.- &quot; Criminal schemes had been manifested at Salonica, where a second GreekGovernment had been constituted, dismissing the Authorities of the Kingdom;.for bidding the bishops to pray for Me in the churches ; removing the royal emblems;pretending to be only a national Government and not an anti-dynastic one, when they became aware of the bad impression that this had produced in Europe ; proceeding byunmentioned cruelties to a compelled conscription of the inhabitants ; persecuting by fire and flame, all those who remained faithful to their allegiance.&quot;Notwithstanding all this, I have, in My desire not to give an impression ofimpeding the action of the Powers, been so far as to consent to the establishment of a neutral zone, dividing de facto My country in two parts ; I have notified that I allowevery man at liberty to enlist to do so in the army which would support the cause ofthe Allies, and I have only requested that all officers and officials willing to go tQSalonica should previously tender their resignation.&quot; After the demobilisation of our army, and the de-existence of our entire navy, thePowers have been sp far as to demand the complete disarmament of Greece.&quot; This would have been impossible to be accepted by My people,, and the more soowing to the certitude that the arms taken would have been sent to the army ofVenizelos.&quot;The most unfortunate incident which occurred between Greek and Allied forceshas taken place against any expectation, and it has&apos;not been proved at all that My.armies, which had formal orders not to fire first, have attacked the marines of theAllied Powers, which were marching against the capital, with a view to occupying thedominating heights, and accompanied by Venizelists.&quot; It is proved to-day beyond doubt that, if the town had been occupied by the,Venizelist revolutionary movement, which had broken out, would have coincided andwould have succeeded to impose itself [sic].&quot; The friends of mark of Venizelos, his. Prime Minister, and several of his ministers were awaiting on. board, the ship of the French Admiral the seizure of the capital.. Underthese circumstances 1 feel the necessity to appeal once more to your feelings as, regards.My person and My dynasty, which feels itself united to you and to your dynasty byindissoluble bonds, and point out to you the dangers to -which the present precariousstate of affairs and the monarchical principles are exposed at this moment in Greece.&quot;Following Macedonia, Crete, Chios, and Mitylene, the islands of Old Greeceare, the one after the other, now occupied, through the help of the Allies&apos; navies, whichhave established there revolutionary authorities,&apos;[lZtio    12 &apos; - C
&quot; The Greek people, seeing that the assurances of the Allied Ministers not tosupport the Venizelist movement in respect to the internal affairs have beencontradicted by the fact that Allied warships have been, and are, at the disposal ofthe Revolution, are afraid that, through the terror exercised by an infinite minorityunder a foreign shield, the subversive movement might continue to spread, while the defensive power of the country is considerably diminished after the acceptation ofultimatum of the day before yesterday.&quot; I am convinced that you will use all your influence to make your Governmentrealise the true aspect of the situation.&quot; The maintenance of order in Greece, indispensable to save the remainder ofMy country from anarchy, would at the same time profit the security of the allied armies in Macedonia much more than all measures taken to weaken us, or than the fewsoldiers who havo joined Venizelos.&quot; Any guarantees in this sense given to Us by the Powers&apos; answer, according toMy absolute conviction, to the principles of equity and to the common interests of ourcountries./q-     ,v    f &quot; CONST AN TINE R.(bigneaj   v&apos;ZALOCOSTAS,Ci Ministre des Affaires Etrangeres.&quot;APPENDIX II.Guns for Merchant Ships.(I.) Letter from War Office to Secretary of the War Cabinet, 19th December, 1916.(II.) Letter from Ministry of Munitions to War Office of the 14th December, 1916.57/3/5215 (A. 2). -Sir, War Office, S.W.I AM commanded by the Army Council to acquaint you, for the information ofthe War Committee, with reference to their decision that the Admiralty demands for -inch guns for arming merchant steamers should be a first charge on the artilleryresources of the country, that they have been in consultation with the Director ofNaval Ordnance and representatives of the Ministry of Munitions.2. A scheme* was prepared by the Minister of Munitions, and it is understood acopy has already been forwarded to you.3. This scheme has been considered by the Army Council. The giving up of gunswill result in postponing the dates by which units will be armed and ready to go intothe field, in reducing the number of guns available to replace damaged or worn guns,and may prevent further assistance being given to the Allies. The Army Council,howrever, are prepared to agree to&apos; Alternative (B), provided no 4-5-inch howitzers aregiven up. To obtain only 60 4-inch guns at the expense of no less than 196 howitzerswrould appear to be a pro-German procedure.4. In view of the small proportion of long-range guns now with the Army, it doesnot seem advisable to curtail the supply of these. For this reason the Army Councilprefer Alternative (B) to Alternative (A) as regards 60-pr. and 6-inch guns.5. The net result of these proposals will, therefore, be that the Army will give upmanufacturing capacity to enable 746-4-inch guns to be constructed for the Navy.6. This, it will be seen, does not meet the Admiralty requirements, and I am tosuggest that if the manufacture of these 4-inch guns is to be continued into 1918 itwould be advisable that the Minister of Munitions should be authorised to provide further manufacturing facilities. .&apos;; 7. With regard to immediate assistance towards the provision of guns for armingmerchant ships, I am to say that the Army Council have already handed Over, or will shortly have available for transfer, to the Admiralty the following number of guns : 120-15-pr. B.L.D. and Q.F.202 4&quot;7-inch guns.201 4&apos;7-inch cradles.   ,89 mountings. - .* A copy of this scheme is annexed.
(II.)Sir,I AM directed by the Minister of Munitions to state that, as a result of an interdepartmental conference held at the Admiralty on the 29th November, he hashad under consideration the effect on the output of artillery for land service of thevery large demands for 4-inch guns which have been put forward by the Admiralty.The result of the investigation has shown that by sacrificing some 942 guns andhowitzers of various calibres 1,055 4-inch guns could be obtained during 1917, or,if a smaller scheme is adopted, by the sacrifice of 721- guns and howitzers of variouscalibres 800 4-inch guns would be gained. The numbers of various calibres to be sacrificed are as follows : Scheme (A).                                     Guns Lost. -                                                   1		4-in.

This instruction Was estimated to yield about100-60-prs., 64 8-inch howitzers, and about 200 4&apos;5-inch howitzers in addition tothe numbers previously notified to the War Office. But since this instruction wasgiven, the War Office has asked for an additional 100 each of 00-prs. and 4%5-inch for equipment purposes. In the case of the 00-prs., this last demand would have been more than met by the new extension. But if Scheme (A) is carried out it will allow forall equipment demands, but will reduce the number of spare guns to 109, while gunswhich it had been hoped would have been available for the Allies will not be forth-coming. Scheme (B) would allow of 207 spare guns and a few carriages. Similarly, thenew 4&quot;5-inch demand, which could have been met by these extensions, can only be fulfilledif spare guns and repaired carriages are used, and there will be a loss of nearly100 spare guns which had been provided in order to replace losses by prematures.   TheThey have also arranged to withdraw fifty more 15-pr. from&apos; France and may possibly be able, during the next three or four months, to supply some more of this nature when these can be released by the substitution of 18-pr.I am, &amp;c.(Signed)      H. H. FAWCETT.
6-48-inch howitzers Mark VI., which would, be lost under either scheme, have not yetbeen brought into any previous estimate, while as regards the 8-inch Mark VII., theloss of 40 could be made up from spare guns, while extra carriages could be obtained.In all these cases the general effect of either scheme would be (a) to limit our assistance to the Allies in these natures to the guns already promised, except in so faras the Army Council is prepared to assign equipments from its own requirements, and(6) to reduce largely the margin of spare guns, provision for which had been arranged as an essential part of the repair and replacement programme. As regards 6-inch guns, Scheme (B) would reduce the programme to the July demand, i.e., it would cutout the additional orders given during October for a general increase in the number ofequipments, while Scheme (A) would reduce the equipments to approximately one halfof Sir Douglas Haig&apos;s demand.It is not known whether the recent demand for 100 additional equipments of eachcalibre, and a 25 reserve on the overseas equipments is additional to these demands.If this is not the case, requirements have been overstated. On the other hand, thefigures represent makers&apos; estimates of deliveries, and it would perhaps be prudent todiscount them by assuming the total numbers will not be delivered until the end ofFebruary or March, 1918.If the Admiralty order for 90-12-pr. 12-cwt. guns is accelerated so as to obtain10 in January, 30 in February, 50 in March, 50 in April, and 10 in May, instead of 50per month (May, June, and July) as originally promised, the output of 18-prs. will be correspondingly delayed in January, February, and March, the deficit being made upin May, June, and July. The Minister will be glad of a decision as to whether thispriority is to be granted.The schemes outlined above will involve a very considerable deduction from the&apos;artillery which would otherwise have been available for the War Office and for theAllies. The decision which must be taken as to whether this programme of substitutionshould be adopted in whole or in part is not one on which the Minister of Munitionscan express an opinion. But as the authority responsible for the exploitation of ourartillery resources to the best advantage, it is perhaps appropriate for him to point outthat to put new guns on merchant ships involves a very large drain on our artilleryresources, as it means that a large potential firing capacity will remain unusedor only partially used. A more economical way of allocating our gun resources would be to take guns from the Field which still have left an effective life of a hundred or so rounds. If, for example, 6-inch 35-calibre guns could be usedon merchant ships their manufacture might be continued and a scheme worked out for passing them on the Admiralty while they still have an effective life of 100 or200 rounds, and replacing them in the Field with new guns. This would involvemanufacturing plant being utilised in making new guns instead of relining thosereturned from the Field, and would somewhat reduce the total number of gunsavailable for the Navy. But it would enable the Army to get the benefit of thegreater part of the effective life of new equipment.I am to state that all the preceding statements are contingent upon labour beingforthcoming for the construction and manning of the extensions of works which arein hand. It is, moreover, of at least equal importance that labour should not be taken from the machine tool manufacturers until the plant for these extensions has been delivered. The estimates which have been made are already endangered by thelabour shortage in the machine tool trade, and the Minister wishes it to be understood by the Army Council that without their co-operation in this matter the output whichhe has foreshadowed cannot possibly be realised.I am to add that the gun manufacturers are at present being held up in. their arrangements, and that if the output of artillery is to be maintained this matter shouldbe settled at a very early date.I am, &amp;c.(Signed) EDMUND PHIPPS.
