Row, R.N., Assistant Secretary.The United States 1. THE War Cabinet took note of the delay which had occurredof America. m the receipt of official information regarding the breaking off of diplomatic relations between the United States of America andGermany, and also of the entire absence of any general appreciation by the British representatives in the United States of America ofthe situation thereby created. They instructed the Foreign Officeto express to the British Ambassador at Washington the disappoint-ment of the War Cabinet at the absence of such information, and to direct him to telegraph immediately an appreciation of the probablebearing of this event on Allied finance, on the production of
munitions for the Allies in America, and on the German ships in american ports.2. The War Cabinet authorised the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, if consulted by the American Ambassador at his forthcoming interview as to the form which any possible american assistance might take, to reply iu the sense that, while Americaremained benevolently neutral, she could render great assistance inthe following ways : (a.) Finance.(6.) Stimulation of steel production,(c.) Building of merchant ships.(( .) Information regarding the position of raiders, the number and tactics of enemy submarines, and the situation inGermany generally.3. The War Cabinet directed the First Sea Lord and the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff to prepare Memoranda showing themanner in which the United States of America could best render assistance in the event of their entry into the War.They directed the Secretary to invite similar Memoranda, fromthe point of view of their respective Departments, from the Ministerof Munitions, the Food Controller, and the Shipping Controller.The Sinking of a 4. The Minister of Blockade and the Fir^t Sea Lord reportedBelgian Relief the sinking of a Belgian relief ship, with only one survivor.Ship.v The War Cabinet asked the Admiralty to obtain all particularsfrom the survivor at the earliest possible moment, and to lose no time in making the facts public, if Buch a course should, after investigation, prove expedient.Belgian Belief. 5. The War Cabinet authorised the Minister of Blockade toinform the Government of the United States that we intended toproceed with Belgian relief through Dutch agencies, if such was found to be practicable.Japan. 6. The War Cabinet decided that :-The possible entry into the War of the United States ofAmerica increased the necessity for an early decision inregard to Japan and Shantung and the occupied Germanislands north of the Equator, in order to avoidnegotiations on the subject with another Power.The War Cabinet therefore desired the Foreign Office and theAdmiralty to expedite their reports on this subject asmuch as possible (War Cabinet 51, Minute 6).Mesopotamia. 7. The  War Cabinet authorised the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff to express their congratulations to General Maude onthe success of the recent operations in Mesopotamia.Transport of Troops 8. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that theto France. Admiralty had asked the War Office to agree to deferring, as fromthe 6th to the 14th instant, on account of the moon, the transportof the 57th Division. The Chief of the Imperial General staff pointed out that this was a serious delay, as it followed severalothers; that sea transport had already been delayed owing to the
Air Raids. 9. The First Sea Lord informed the War Cabinet that air raids had been carried out on Zeebrugge and Bruges.Blockade of theUnited Kingdom,France, and Italy.10. The Minister of Blockade reported that protests were being received from various neutrals against our detention of their ships,and that their Governments were recalling them. This latter action was now known to have been taken in one case at German instigation.Satisfactory progress was being made in the negotiations with theowners of neutral vessels.   The War Cabinet decided that-The detention of the neutral ships should be continued forthe present, and that the authorisation given on the3rd February to Lord Robert Cecils Departmental Com-mittee to use their discretion in utilising such shipsas they considered desirable should be renewed (WarCabinet, 53, Minute 7 (5) ).The BritishBlockade&quot;11. The Minister of Blockade reported that, owing to theGerman proclamation of blockade, various neutral governments were asking that arrangements might be made so as to obviate thenecessity for their ships being brought into Kirkwall for examination a course which implied passing through the proclaimed dangerzone.The War Cabinet recognised the objections to a departure from the existing procedure under pressure of the German blockade,but they also realised that considerable numbers of neutral shipsmight be sunk if we insisted on a continuance of the present arrangement, and that if the neutrals preferred to run the blockadethere would be a serious diminution of its efficiency. They decidedthat In principle we must maintain our right of search, and that itwas not very material whether the search took place inBritish waters or at the port of departure.They instructed the Minister of Blockade to prepare for their consideration (a.) The draft of an Order in Council providing thatneutral ships that endeavoured to evade theBritish patrols should, be liable to condemnationin our Prize Courts.non-return of the ten ships taken away from War Office service teconvey wheat from America; that the Portuguese Division hadbeen greatly delayed, and that it was not yet clear when the wholemight reach France. The French themselves had recently declined to convey our troops from the ports for some four to seven daysbecause of congestion on their railways. If the 57th Division was now to be kept back for a week, the three Divisions to follow wouldbe delayed, and, consequently, the preparations to which the WarCabinet attached so much importance.The First Sea Lord explained that the risk from submarinesduring moonlit nights would be very great, owing to the fact thatthe Germans were employing a larger number of submarines than ever before, that there were no escorts available, and that suchcould only be provided at the expense of convoying food ships.The War Cabinet instructed the Admiralty to consider thepossibility of providing escorts for the whole or a part ofthe Division, at the expense of some other national service,and, failing this, to aim at the provision of additionaltransports in order to speed up the transport of the division and the others under orders to follow it during the nextdark period.
(6.) A detailed scheme for the examination of neutral shipping, either hy special staffs attached tothe Consulates at ports of departure, or atintermediate British ports outside the pro-claimed danger zone.The Destruction of enemy Sub-marines :The Question of publication.12. The War Cabinet discussed the question of publishing thefigures in regard to the sinking of enemy submarines. The first sea Lord explained that the Admiralty only recognised as certainlosses those submarines iu regard to which particulars had appeared in the German Casualty Lists, and that the number of these wasdisappointingly small. On the other hand, having regard to theBritish losses in submarines which could not be^ accounted for, itwas probable that the actual number of German vessels destroyedwas greater than that given by the above system of calculation. TheWar Cabinet decided that The publication of details as to the number of enemy sub-marines known to be destroyed was inadvisable, as itmight cause a false impression and also some disappoint-ment,  and that all that could be issued was a general* statement in Parliament, if occasion should arise.Attendance at theWar Cabinet.-13. The War Cabinet had under consideration the loss of timeand interference with the duties of the Heads of the various government Departments caused hy the system of invitation toattend War Cabinet Meetings.   They decided that (a.) The existing system of sending out Agenda Papers with an approximate time-table should continue ; but that thereceipt of an Agenda Paper should be taken by its^recipient merely as a notification of the Meeting.(6.) So far as the subjects on the Agenda Paper concerned his department, the recipient should hold himself, and anyof his officials whose presence might be required, in readiness to attend the War Cabinet at the timementioned, but should not come to 10, Downing Streetuntil summoned by telephon .(Initialled) D. LI. G.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,February 5, 1917.note by the Secretary. The question of Man Power in relation&apos; to NationalService was also discussed in reference to a Memorandum by the Army Councilregarding the Supply of Men for the Army, dated February 2, 1917, ar.d the second report of the Director-General oF National Service in his proposed organisation,dated February 3, 1917. Discussion was deferred to the 55th Meeting of the &quot;WarCabinet, to be held in the afternoon, when the statements made were to be taken intoconsideration.
