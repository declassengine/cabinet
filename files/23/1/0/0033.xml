( LE Charge dAffaires de France a 1&apos;honneur de transmettre, ci-joint, au Secretaired&apos;Etat pour les Affaires Etrangeres un extrait d&apos;un telegramme que son Gouvernementvient de lui adresser au sujet de 1&apos;envoi des missions alliees en Pussie.Ambassade de France, Londres.M.

Pendant leur voyage, la criseministerielle russe recevra une solution et nous serons assures ainsi de ne pas perdrede temps; &quot; nous n&apos;en avons plus a perdre.&quot;Paris, le ! 1 Janvier, 1917.APPENDIX II.Memorandum by Lord Devonport.Restriction of Brewing.THE amount of beer that can be brewed and is being brewed at the present timeunder the Output of Beer Restriction Act is 26,000,000 standard barrels, involving theuse of about 955,000 tons of barley, 57,000 tons of grits, and 120,000 tons of sugar.This is 85 per cent, of what is known as the 1915 output (the actual period in theOutput.of Beer Restriction Act runs from the 1st April, 1915, to the 31st March, 1916).It is suggested that the amount be now reduced to 50 per cent, of the 1915 output.This would, save or set free for other purposes about 400,000 tons of barley, 23,000 tonsof grits [which are for the most part maize), and 50,000 tons of sugar.This proposal rests on the following grounds : 1. It will save the tonnage now used for the sugar and the imported barley andgrits, except in so far as any of this continues to be imported for other essential purposes.2. It will make home-grown barley available for mixing Avith wheat for bread.Barley is particularly valuable for this purpose, because there are nomechanical difficulties in milling it with wheat.   This will save tonnage on imported wheat or other cereals.3. It will make unquestionably better use of the food value of the barlej- than is done in brewing (see extract below from report of the Royal SocietyCommittee).4. It will save labour, internal transport of very bulky goods, and fuel.The procedure for giving effect to this policy has received carefal considerationafter consultation with representatives of the Central Control Board (Liquor Traffic),of the Board of Trade, and of the Customs and Excise Department. The followingcourse is suggested : 1. An immediate return should he obtained of all stocks of malt and of barley andother cereals bought for malting purposes, and further malting should be stopped byan Order under the Defence of the Realm Regulation as soon as a sufficient amount ofmalt has been made to produce the reduced quota of beer that will be permitted.This action must be taken forthwith as the malting season is already far advanced.For this reason alone it is desirable that a decision on the proposals in thisMemorandum should be reached at the earliest possible moment.2. The actual restriction on brewing should be imposed by an amendment of theOutput of Beer Restriction Act.   This Act limits the maximum barrelage that can be
brewed by any brewer to 85 per cent, of tbe amount brewed by him in 1915, i.e.,enforces a reduction of 15 per cent. The amendment proposed is to substitute asfrom the 1st April, 1917, 50 per cent for 15 per cent, as the reduction required. an earlier alteration would lead to a charge of breach of faith, in view of the terms of theexisting Act, and, in any case, an alteration taking effect in the middle of a quarterwould, in the view of the Customs and Excise Department, be practically impossibleto administer.3. Steps should be taken to control the distribution of the reduced output of beer so as to prevent particular districts or licensed houses from having their supplies. disproportionately curtailed or cut off altogether.4. In order to prevent the reduced supply of beer leading to an increased con-sumption of spirits, measures may also prove necessary to secure a correspondingcontrol in regard to the distribution and sale of spirits.5. The export of beer, save under licence, should be prohibited. All beer exportedrepresents grain that has previously been imported and on which has been expendedlabour, coal, and transport facilities. This export trade has considerably increased during the year 191b.The Customs and Excise returns show the export as under : 1913 ..1914 ..        ..        ..        ....1915For the ten months of 1916 ending October 31For the same period of 19151914        ......Estimated total export for 1916, 780,000 standard barrelsBarrels.655.461539,269533,363614,726412.192471,412Drastic restrictions have long been in force in Germany and are now being madestill more drastic. Till November last the breweries of Northern Germany were allowed35 per cent., and those of Southern Germany 48 per cent, of their pre-war suppliesof barley. On the 17th November the northern breweries were reduced to 25 per cent,(out of which 14 per cent, is absorbed for military purposes) ; no change has apparently been made yet in the south. These figures compare with a percentage of 73 per cent,still permitted in the United Kingdom.The followiug cutting from the &quot; Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; of the21st December, 1913, appears to show that the recent reduction in Germany is con-nected with the further use of barley to dilute wheaten flour : &quot; In consequence of the shortage of potatoes, the use of dried potato products in bread will be completely stopped in Germany after the 1st January, and barley-flour will be substituted. The necessary barley has been obtained by reducingthe brewing ration. The original idea of using rye-flour, obtained by a sharpermilling of that grain, has been abandoned, in order not to reduce the availablequantity of rve-bran.&quot;DEVONPORT.Ministry of Food, Grosvenor House, W.,January 5, 1917.Enclosure 1.Statement of Possible Objections and Answers.   .The proposal will, no doubt, be resisted on the following, amongst other, grounds : 1. That it is an attack on a particular trade and will cause widespread loss forwhich compensation should be paid. To this it may be answered that the restrictionso proposed is practically the same as that proposed in the case of confectionery andaerated waters, where it is contemplated that the use of sugar should be limited to 40or 45 per cent, of the pre-war use. There is no talk of compensation there. other trades have beeu or are being seriously affected because the country could not affordthem in war time. It would indeed be very difficult to justify a reduction of the sugarused in confectionery without making at least an equal reduction of the sugar used inbeer. It would be equally difficult to give compensation in one case and not inthe other.
2. That it. will deprive farmers of a valuable feeding-stuff, viz., brewers&apos; grains.To this it may be answered that if the barley is milled for human consumption, thebarley offals (about 40 percent, of the whole grain) will be at least a full equivalent forfeeding purposes. If the barley is not all milled for human consumption, the balancewill, of course, be directly available for animals, though such a use is open to the criticism that it is not the most economical use of the barley (see next paragraph).Undoubtedly in some districts, notably Dublin, where the cows during the winter are largely fed on brewers&apos; grains, there may be a temporary difficulty of transition to a newfeeding-stuff, but this can clearly be surmounted by proper organisation. In any case,if the reduction of brewing is not brought into force before the 31st March (asproposed below) little or no difficulty can arise till next winter.3. That beer is a food, preserving a large proportion of the nutritive value of itsmaterials. On this point the conclusion of the Food Committee of the Royal Society,in their report just presented, is of great value : &quot; The beer, together with the bye-products of the brewery, contains between27 per cent, and 58 per cent, of the energy and less than 27 per cent, of theprotein of the original material; whereas if these materials were not brewed, bututilised in the theoretically best possible manner, about 71 per cent, of the energy and 68 per cent, of the protein would be recovered as human food. This very high recovery is possible only if the use of the barley and other materials as food for live stock is equally prohibited. If, as would otherwise be the case, they wereconverted into meat, only 15 per cent, of the energy and 17 per cent, of theprotein would be realised as human food.&quot;If, therefore, the barley is not kept mainly for human consumption a measure for restricting brewing will undoubtedly be attacked with some force as wasteful of food.If the barley can be used mainly for mixing with wheat flour, the scientific argumentis conclusive against brewing.APPENDIX III.CENTRAL CONTROL BOARD (LIQUOR TRAFFIC).Memorandum by Lord ITAbernon.1. ORDERS of the Central Control Board (Liquor Traffic) are now in force overby far the greater part of Great Britain. Under these Orders the hours for the sale and supply of intoxicating liquor are rigorously curtailed; the practice of treating,and the sale of, liquor on credit are prohibited ; the strength of spirits has beenreduced ; and other regulations of a restrictive character have been imposed.2. From all quarters favourable reports have been received of the remarkableimprovement which these Orders have brought about; and unmistakable evidencehas been forthcoming to show that, notwithstanding the largely increased spending power of the industrial classes, the measure of success attained by the Board&apos;s Ordershas been far greater than might have been anticipated from a policy of restrictionunaccompanied by fundamental reorganisation of the trade. But on the evidence before them the Board are convinced that, though there has been great improvement,further substantial progress is attainable. The successful prosecution of the war isstill being hampered by excessive consumption of intoxicating liquor.3. This excessive consumption is of serious consequence to the efficiency of ourfighting forces, especially in regard to material. Looked at from another point of view it involves wastage of the nation&apos;s food supplies, and prevents economy in the use ofthe nations resources in the matter of sea and land transport. In the light of theexperience which they have gained during the last eighteen months, the Board are ofopinion that the time has now come when comprehensive measures, beyond theirpresent powers, are necessary in order to carry to completion the work of restriction and control which the Board were established to discharge.
4. There are three possible policies : (a.) More stringent restrictions ;(b.) Prohibition ; and(c.) Direct and complete control by the State of the manufacture and sale ofintoxicating liquor throughout Great Britain.5. With regard to (a) the Board are of opinion that the limits of effective action by alteration of the existing Orders have been well-nigh reached, and that anyfurther action on these lines would be inadequate to obtain the further progress which is necessary for the best efficiency of the nation. . AVhat is required is notmodification or increased stringency of the existing Orders, but their stricterobservance. For this a different and less imperfect machinery is needed. In many areas, and those the areas in which excessive drinking is most prejudicial to efficiency, the Orders now in force admittedly do not and cannot produce their full effect on account of the inherent difficulty, under present conditions and with theTrade as now constituted, of securing the compliance of the public and the Trade.The pressure of competition in the Trade, aggravated as it is by a redundancy ofpublic-houses, has made it difficult for licensees to employ measures of restraint whichmay have the result of irritating customers, and diverting trade to competing houses.6. With regard to (6) the policy of prohibition has been widely canvassed duringthe war, but as at present advised the Board do not feel justified in recommending its adoption. They do not regard it as essential for the conduct of the war, provided thatsufficiently stringent measures of control are applied. From the purely financial pointof view, it would probably have the disadvantage of involving the State in the paymentof large sums as compensation, apart from the loss of a considerable proportion of thenational revenue. And there are obvious &apos; objections to any policy adopted for theperiod of the war which would be likely to lead to violent reaction when the war is over.7. The remaining policy, namely, direct and complete control by the State, hasalready in four areas Carlisle, Gretna, Invergordon, and Enfield been put to thepractical test of experience by the Board. In all these areas the results so far achieved,even in the short space of time during which the Board have been in possession, andin spite of exceptional difficulties, including the influx of a large temporary population,have been most encouraging. Excessive drinking in these areas has been substantially reduced, and measures have been taken to meet the demand for improvedconditions in. the supply of food and non-alcoholic refreshment.8. State control has come to be regarded with more and more favour as being thepolicy which offers the most rapidly effective and the best permanent solution of theproblem. Local authorities in adjacent areas have urged the Board to provide, by anextension of the existing boundaries, for their own inclusion in the area within whichState control is now in operation.9. The Board are satisfied that State control would give the following importantresults : (a.) Strict observance of the law.(b.) The elimination of all private profit in the sale of liquor.(c.) The immediate suppression of many thousands of redundant licences.(d.) The regulation of the quantity, quality, and strength of liquor, facilitating the conservation of food supplies and the more economical use of transport,(e.) Extended facilities for the supply of food and non-alcoholic refreshment.(/.) The amalgamation and reorganisation on an economical basis of manufacturing and wholesale businesses.(g.) The release of a large number of men and women for work connected withthe war.Although not an essential element in a scheme of State control, the temporary suspension of the sale of spirits would become immediately practicable if deemed necessary by the Government in the national interest.10. With regard to the financial aspect of the policy, the Board desire to point outthat suppression of licences, concentration of businesses, the reduction and economicaluse of land tansport would result in a large saving of working expenses ; and that, intheir opinion, no apprehension need be felt as to the effect of the proposed reform onthe annual revenue of the State.11. The Board have considered the possibility of assuming control of the drinktraffic for the period of the war only, or as a preliminary to purchase at some later[1365-33] &quot; D
date, but they are satisfied that both on financial and on administrative grounds apolicy of purchase outright is by far the more desirable course to adopt in the particular circumstances of the liquor trade. Acquisition, except on a permanent basis, wouldmake it impossible to bring into full effect a revised and improved system of manage-ment, the central feature of Avhich is undoubtedly the substitution for tenants of salariedmanagers having no financial interest in the sale of liquor. The governing authoritycould not deal effectively with concentration of businesses, reconstruction and adaptation of premises, and. with the staff of the various undertakings and licensed houses. Theexpedient would be a costly one, involving the payment of large sums from theExchequer in the form of compensation, without securing to the State the advantage ofpermanent control. If State control is to be adopted, purchase outright appears to theBoard to be the most practical and the only financially sound procedure..12. Having regard to all these considerations, the Board recommend that thepolicy of State purchase be adopted.13. The Board have not deemed it necessary at the present stage to refer to thebasis on which compensation should be paid to the various interests or to the precisemethod by which direct control should be exercised. With regard to the basis ofcompensation, His Majesty&apos;s Government have already at their disposal the reports(Cd. 8283 and 8319) presented in April 1915, by the Liquor Trade Finance Committeeappointed to consider this question in its relation to England and Wales and to scotland. The question of the best means to be adopted for the exercise of direct control has for some time past been engaging the attention of the Board, who haveaccumulated a considerable mass of information on the subject. The Board would beprepared, if so directed, to submit a full report on this and other relevant questions for the consideration of His Majesty&apos;s Government.(Signed) D&apos;ABERNON, Chainnan.December 16, 1918.APPENDIX IV.Proceedings at a Conference held on Friday, the 12th January, at 11*30,between (a) the Prime Minister, Lord Milner, and Me, Henderson, and(6) the Director of National Service, the President of the Local Govern-ment Board, the President of the Board of Agriculture, and the Ministerof Labour.In attendance: Sir Maurice Hankey, K.C.B.

Note by the Secretary of State for War.WITH reference to the Conclusion recently reached at the Allied Conference atRome regarding the relations between Generals Sarrail and Milne, I forward draft instructions which 1 propose to issue to General Milne. As I was not present at theConference and do not understand why any modification of the existing arrangement should have been proposed, I should be glad to know if the draft is approved bythe War Cabinet.
