THE War Cabinet had under consideration the applicationof the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to reply to the requestof the United States Government for the provision of a safe-conductto the German Ambassador and his Staff, and their request forsearch arrangements to be made at Halifax instead of at Kirkwall.It was agreed that: In view of the great desire of the United States Government toget rid of Count Bernstorff, the safe-conduct should begiven.The United States:The german ambassador.With regard to the  question of  calling at Kirkwall, two alternatives were considered : (a.) The proposal of the Admiralty that we should insist thatno exception should be made in favour of the german ambassador, and that the ship should call at Kirkwall.[1365-57] B
The object of this proposal is that the examinationof the ship&apos;s documents, &amp;o, is a very highly expertbusiness, and, in the opinion of the Admiralty, could notbe carried out so effectively at Halifax as at Kirkwall.(o.) The proposal of the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs that we should refuse to waive, in principle, our generalpolicy of insisting on the Kirkwall call, but should makea special exception to meet the views of the UnitedStates of America.The War Cabinet considered that our main objects should beto conciliate the United States of America, and to get rid of theGerman Ambassador before he can take advantage of any reaction from the present wave of enthusiasm ; but on no account to abandon the general principle of our right to insist that the ship shall call atKirkwall.The War Cabinet therefore Approved the proposal of the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs,&quot; and authorised him to telegraph in that sense tothe British Ambassador at Washington (Appendix I).The Secretary of State for the Colonies undertook, afterconsultation with the Admiralty, to send a telegram to theGovernment of the Dominion of Canada, impressing on them the importance of an exhaustive and comprehensivebut courteous search being made of the german ambassador and his Staff, the passengers, and crew of theship, to be carried out in conjunction with the senior naval Officer present.The First Sea Lord undertook to send a correspondingcommunication to the Senior Naval Officer at Halifax.The Conference in 2. The War Cabinet took note that the Chief of the Imperialssia&quot; General Staff is taking steps to give effect to a recommendation byGeneral Sir H. Wilson for the establishment of a British Mission inRussia to expedite the delivery of guns and ammunition, and todeal with various artillery and aviation matters.Delay on theFrench Railways.3. It was brought to the notice of the War Cabinet that, owingto delays on the French railways, our military preparations for the campaign of 1917 were being interfered with, and the generalsituation was, in consequence, becoming very unsatisfactory.The War Cabinet directed the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff to obtain a statement from the Coinmauder-in-.Cb.iefof the British Expeditionary Force, and lay it before theCabinet at an early date, with a view to the Foreign Officetransmitting it to the French Government.Mining of a transport.4. The First Sea Lord reported the mining of the transport&quot; Tindarius &quot; off Cape Aghullas, near the Cape of Good Hope. he stated that&apos;the troops had been taken off by a hospital ship andtransport, and that the &quot; Tindarius &quot; herself was making her wayto Simonstown.
Submarines.5. The First Sea Lord reported a number of engagements withsubmarines, including several that indicated a probability of suc-cessful results.The War Cabinet considered the serious situation threatened by the increased losses from submarines.    They decided that The question ought to be examined from the point of view of amuch more serious situation arising than at present, cuhni-nating in something approaching a blockade.The Prime Minister stated that the lines we were working on atpresent were in the direction of (a.) A more extensive system of food production.(6.) An increase in our tonnage,(c.) The restriction of imports.(d.) An examination of the possibilities of a temporary curtail-ment of imports of raw materials for munitions, with aview to the accumulation of a larger stock of foodstuffs.The Prime Minister undertook to invite the attention of theFood Controller to various suggestions made for checking!waste and extravagance in the consumption of food, and requested the Chief of the Imperial General Staff to confer with the Minister of Munitions, and report how far theproduction of munitions might be temporarily decreasedconsistent with the safety of the Army.The CapturedGerman Colonies.6. The War Cabinet discussed with the Secretary of State forthe Colonies a telegram from the Governor-General of the Union ofSouth Africa, dated the 6th feburary (Appendix II).Having regard to the general arrangements with our Allies,that no definite decisions should be taken in regard to re-arrange-ment of territory until the question could be treated as a whole atthe Peace Conference at the conclusion of the war, the War cabinet authorised The Secretary of State for the Colonies to reply in the sense that in his speech he had expressed views which he believed to be held by the Dominion Governments in;general ; that it would be as well for the Governor-general to make no reference to the subject in his speech ; andthat the whole question would be considered with theImperial Representatives at the forthcoming SpecialMeetings of the War Cabinet.The BritishBlockade.7. The War Cabinet had before them the draft of an Orderin Council (Appendix III), prepared by the Minister of Blockadein accordance with the decision taken on the 5th February (WarCabinet 54, Minute 11 (a) ). The effect of this Order is to deterneutral ships from endeavouring to avoid the British patrols, by substituting condemnation for the existing detention and loss oftime as the penalty for evasion.Having regard to the inability of the Admiralty to guarantee that more than a proportion of neutrals endeavouring to escape our patrols will be captured -The War Cabinet approved the Order in Council, and directedthe Minister of Blockade, in connection with it, to make a communication to neutral Governments to the effect thatwe would, in special cases, make arrangements to examineships in ports outside the danger zone.
-Blockade of theUnited Kingdom,&quot;France, and Italy.Manning ofMerchantmen:iBonus to Crews.Hospital Ships::.$Reprisals.8. The Minister of Blockade brought to the notice of theWar Cabinet the fact that the French are continuing to time-charterat high rates, thus making our negotiations difficult, and thatMr. Royden had gone to France with a view to improving thearrangements.Neutral shipping is still being held up in our ports, exceptthat Norwegian ships are being allowed to trade with France. Onthe other hand, neutrals are holding up their own shipping fromcoming here.The Minister of Blockade reported that no strong protest hadbeen received from neutral Governments, but that it was evidentthat our policy cannot be maintained much longer. He hoped thatarrangements might be made for purchasing the vessels, and in thisconnection the War Cabinet decided that 40L a ton would not be excessive, having regard to theimportance of obtaining this addition to our shipping,amounting to about 500,000 tons.9. The Minister of Blockade informed the War Cabinet thatthere was evidence to show that there may be difficulty in persuading the crews of neutral vessels to sail under existing circumstances.He therefore proposed, where vessels are chartered on government account, a bonus should be paid to the officers and crew, calculatedupon the basis of 5()Z. for a captain, and 51. for a seaman, other ranks and ratings pro raid. In the first instance, these bonuses tobe only paid to vessels chartered on Government account. Heestimated that this would mean an expenditure of 200,00QZ. forneutral services, and 2,250,000Z. for British services. The WarCabinet Authorised the grant of a bonus to masters and crews of neutral ships if this was necessary to the success of thenegotiations. They stipulated, however, that if a bonus isgiven to neutrals it should also be given to british merchant seamen, who are at present running very greatrisks.10. With reference to War Cabinet 50, Minute 5, the WarCabinet had under consideration the Report of Lord Curzon&apos;sCommittee on Reprisals (Appendix IV), and approved therecommendations contained therein, except as regards communi-cating, at the present stage, the form the reprisals would take. TheWar Cabinet decided that The Admiralty and the Director of Prisoners of War should,as soon as one of our hospital ships had been attacked,arrange for the embarkation in each hospital ship of asufficient number of German officers and men as would ensure that they could not. be recaptured and all embarkedin one of the enemy&apos;s submarines.(Initialled) D.

Paraphrase of Telegram dated February 8. 1917, to Sir C. Spring-Rice(Washington) from the Foreign Office.WE are readily prepared to give Bernsdtorff and his suite safe-conduct against any perils which might present themselves from British action ; we do not see any reason either in courtesy or in equity why our general policy should he changed tosafeguard him against his own countrymen&apos;s acts of illegality. Should, however, theGovernment of the United States of America press it, we shall he willing to obligethem, to make an exception to the rule, which we consider of the first importance, thatvessels must put in at Kirkwall. In that event we should make arrangements for theship and party to be searched at Halifax.APPENDIX II.Telegram from the Governor-General of the Union of South Africa to the Secretaryof State for the Colonies, and Proposed Draft Telegram to the Governor-General,Pretoria.(Received, Colonial Office, 2&apos;34 p.m., February 6, 1917.)REUTER reports here that in speech Friday 2nd you stated : &quot; Let no manthink that struggle by which we acquired the German &quot; Colonies has been foughtin vain; let no man tbink that these territories shall ever return to German rule.&quot;May I quote and emphasise this declaration in speech at dinner to Smuts on Friday ?Would be useful here if I might.   I leave for Cape Town to-day. Buxton.APPENDIX  III.[February 7, 1917.]WHEREAS by an Order in Council dated the 11th day of March, 1915, HisMajesty was pleased to direct certain measures to be taken against the commerce ofthe enemy in retaliation for the orders issued by the enemy which, in violation of theusages of war, purported to declare the waters surrounding the United Kingdom to bea military area in which British and Allied merchant vessels would be destroyedirrespective of the safety of the lives of passengers and crew, and in which neutral shipping would be exposed to similar danger in view of the uncertainties of navalwarfare ;And whereas the German Government has now issued a memorandum declaring that from the 1st February, 1917, all sea traffic will be prevented in certain zonestherein described adjacent to Great Britain and France and Italy, and that neutral ships will navigate the said zones at their own risk;And whereas similar directions have been given by the other enemy Powers ;And whereas the orders embodied in the said memorandum are in flagrantcontradiction with the rules of international law, the dictates of humanity, and thetreaty obligations of the enemy ;And whereas such proceedings on the part of the enemy give to His Majesty anunquestionable right of retaliation, and render it necessary for His Majesty to adoptfurther measures in order to maintain the efficiency of those previously taken toprevent commodities of any kind from reaching or leaving the enemy countries, andfor this purpose to subject to capture and condemnation vessels carrying goods withan enemy destination or of enemy origin unless they afford unto the forces of HisMajesty and his Allies ample opportunities of examining their cargoes, and also tosubject such goods to condemnation ;[And whereas the Allies of His Majesty are associated with him in the steps now-directed to be taken]:
His Majesty is therefore pleased, by and with the advice of His Privy Council, to order, and it is hereby Ordered, that the following directions shall be observed inrespect of all vessels which sail from their port of departure after the date of this order:-1. Any vessel carrying goods with an enemy destination, or of enemy origin, shallbe liable to capture and condemnation in respect of the carriage of such goods.2. A vessel which is encountered at sea on her way to or from a port in anyneutral country affording, means of access to the enemy territory without calling ata port in British or Allied territory shall, until the contrary is established, be deemedto be earrying goods with an enemy destination or of enemy origin,, and shall bebrought in for examination, and, if necessary, for adjudication before our Prize Court.3. Provided that, in the case of any vessel which calls at an appointed British orAllied port for the examination of her cargo, no such presumption as is laid down inarticle 2 shall arise, and no sentence of condemnation shall be pronounced in respectonly of the carriage of goods of enemy origin or destination.4. Goods which are found on the examination of any vessel to be goods of enemy origin or of enemy destination shall be liable to condemnation.5. Nothing in this Order shall be deemed to affect the liability of any vessel orgoods to capture or condemnation independently of this Order, or to derogate from theprovisions of the Orders in Council of the 11th March, 1915, and the 10th January,1947, framing reprisals for restricting the commerce of the enemy.appendix  iv.Proceedings of a Committee held at the Foreign Office on Friday, February 2, 1917,to consider the Question of Reprisals if our Hospital Ships are Sunk by theGermans.Present:The Right Honourable the Earl Curzon of Kedleston, K.G., G.C.S.I., G.C.I.E.(in the Chair).The Right Honourable A. J. Balfour, O.M., M.P., Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs.The Right Honourable the Lord Robert Cecil, K.C., M.P., Minister of Blockade.The Right Honourable the Lord Newton, Under-Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs.Lieutenant-General Sir H. E. Belfield, K.C.B.,.C.B., D.S.O., Director of Prisonersof War.Major-General Sir G. M. W. Macdonogh, C.B., Director of Military Intelligence,War Office.Rear-Admiral Jackson, Director of Operations Division, Admiralty.THE Committee considered the question of reprisals in the event of GermanyCarrying out her threats to sink our hospital ships en route between France and england, and vice versa.The precedent of the action of the Germans in 1870 during the Franco-german war of putting prisoners, such as mayors of towns, on the engines of military trainsliable to attack, was brought to the notice of the Committee.It was noted that whenever during the present war we have threatened reprisalson minor points the Germans have always given way, as, for instance, in the case of (a.) The threatened solitary confinement of two  British  civilian prisoners inRuble ben ;(b.) Forcing our non-commissioned officers, who were prisoners, to work ; and(c.) Not giving our officers and men the proper rate of exchange, thus makingdeductions from their remittances from England.The following forms of reprisals were considered :  1. The punishment at the end of the war of those responsible for giving theorders for sinking hospital ships.    This was considered impracticable.
*Threats to this effect have already been made in the case of otheratrocities ; but it is doubtful to what extent we may be able to put them into execution.2. Threats to execute the next German officer taken on any submarine. the sense of the Committee was against this proposal, on the ground tbat thereprisal had no immediate relation to the offence for which it would beinflicted ; that it might have to be delayed for a long time ; that it was acold-blooded and brutal act, which wonlcl probably be repugnant to publicopinion, both in this and neutral countries; and that it would almost certainly provoke counter-reprisals of an even more bloody description.3. The question of bombing undefended towns. The Committee felt that it was far preferable to inflict reprisals on military individuals than on women and children. Moreover, owing to the increasing need of sending all ouraeroplanes to the front for other purposes, it was pointed out that this formof reprisal might involve the sacrifice of valuable men a:&quot;d machines.4. Putting German officers and men on board hospital ships, in numbers to bedecided by the War Cabinet. It was pointed out by the Admiralty thatarrangements would have to be made to prevent these persons frominterfering with the rescue of the wounded, &amp;c, if the hospital ship was sunk.In this connection the status of the hospital ship was considered, andit was suggested that so-called hospital ships which take woundedbetween France and England might not strictly by law be covered by theHague Convention, but might come under the Geneva Convention. Underthe latter it was suggested that they could be defensibly armed, and that possibly circumstances might arise in which it would be desirable to do so.The Committee further considered the question of disguising hospital ships sothat they might appear to be ordinary passenger ships, and sending them unlighted.The Admiralty pointed out that in such cases we should have to provide escorts, as inthe case of mail steamers carrying wounded back to the Colonies, and this would be amatter of considerable difficulty.The Committee decided to recommend to the War Cabinet that : 1. The threat should be communicated to Germany that if they attack ourhospital ships in the manner foreshadowed by them, we shall place anumber of German officers and men on board similar ships in future. Itwas roughly estimated that we have about 1,000 military and naval officersin Great Britain, while the French have, in France, a large number inaddition.2. For the present, and until the Germans show their hand, it would be wise to treat hospital ships as heretofore, i.e., they should show all thedistinguishing marks and lights.3. If the Germans continue to attack our hospital ships, in spite of the reprisalsrecommended above, it would then be desirable that the character andappearance of the hospital ships should be disguised; that they should be armed ; that they should, as far as possible, travel under escort, and carryno lights at night.4. We should inform our Allies as to any steps we propose to take in the abovedirection.o
