LORD  CLTRZON  reported  that his Committee  on  theImports. Restriction of  Imports  had reassembled, as  requested   by theWar Cabinet on the 19th February (War Cabinet, 74, Minute 2).Instead of finding themselves confronted merely with the problemof examining a further restriction in the supply of timber,,they had before them a memorandum, prepared under the authority of theShipping Controller, by Sir Alfred Watson and Mr. W. P. Elderton(War Cabinet Paper G.-129), which entirely altered the wholebasis of the Committee&apos;s previous report.Lord Curzon pointed out that the net result of this report wasthat the total year&apos;s shortage of shipping would be equivalent to areduction of imports by 8,000,000 tons, instead of 0,000,000 tons as[1365-77] &apos; B
previously assumed, and that the greater part of this deficiencywould have to be made good by measures operating during thelast eight months of 1917. In consequence, Sir H. Babington Smith&apos;sCommittee, having reassembled, presented for the consideration ofthe War Cabinet a further report (Appendix I), proposing more drastic restrictions in imports.Timber from 2. The possibility of obtaining the requisite timber for the useFrance. of the Army in France from behind the lines there was considered,and the War Cabinet requested the Secretary of State for War to select a senior officer, assisted by a timber expert, and despatchthem to make enquiries and render a report as soon as possibleas to (1.) Whether the total requirements of all kinds of timber couldnot be obtained in the vicinity of our front;(2.) AVhat labour could be provided by the Army ;(3.) Whether the transport facilities were adequate, and, if not,what action was recommended.Labour Supply for 3. The War Cabinet considered the question   of procuringprocuring British additional labour in the United Kingdom for obtaining the necessaryTimber. timber from local sources, and it was brought to their notice that,in the case of pit-props, skilled labour, except for supervision, wasnot essential.The War Cabinet decided that-(a.) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should place thematter before the Russian Government, and ask them tosend us Finnish or other labour for wood-cutting, &amp;c,communicating the reply to the Director of timber supplies ;(6.) The Secretary of State for the Colonies should take up thematter from the point of view of obtaining Dominionlabour for the same purpose, also communicating the replies to the Director of Timber Supplies ;(c.) The Director of National Service should ascertain whatskilled labour was available as regards men over age orotherwise not suitable for military service in the UnitedKingdom, and acquaint Sir Bampfylde Fuller ;      .     -(d.) The Minister . for Education should enquire into theemployment of schoolboys, between the ages of 16 and18, in this work, and inform the Director of timber supplies as to the results of his enquiries ;(e.) The War Cabinet directed the Secretary to ask the Secretaryof State for War to instruct Sir Bampfylde Fuller, theDirector of Timber Supplies (in concert with such other Departments as are concerned), to prepare for their consideration at the earliest possible date a national scheme of organisation for the supply and transport of,all kinds of timber, including pit-props, on the basisof the information obtained from the foregoing enquiries.They suggest that Sir Bampfylde Fuller should alsoconsult in this matter not only the experts of the lateHome-grown Timber Committee, but also other experts,such as Sir Hugh Shaw-Stewart, Sir Herbert Maxwell,and Professor Somerville, of Oxford.
Spirits.4. With regard to the further restrictions in brewing (WarCabinet, 70, Minute 7), the War Cabinet decided, as a question ofprinciple, that A corresponding reduction should again be made by. theChancellor of the Exchequer in the quantities of winesand spirits released from bond.Restriction of liquor Traffic.5. - The War Cabinet decided that No further restriction of brewing would be advisable at thepresent time, and that steps must be taken to protect the&quot; free houses.&quot; They requested the Secretary of State for home Affairs to form a Committee, on which the brewingtrade should be represented, to enquire further into theposition created by the restrictions ah-eady approved (WarCabinet, 70, Minute 7), and report their proposals as soonas  vracticable for the consideration of the War Cabinet.Distilling.Acetone.Reduction of Maizeimported.6. The War Cabinet approved in principle a proposal of theMinister of Munitions to purchase, after consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, acetone in the United States ofAmerica in order to diminish the very large quantities of maizeused for the production of this substance. They desired theDirector of National Service to bear in mind that this will involvethe closing of a number of distilleries, and consequently release from them a certain amount of labour. They further directed theSecretary to bring the matter to the notice of the Food controller and the President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries fromthe point of view of its effect on supplies of feeding-stuffs.Orders in Council, 7. The War Cabinet authorised the President of the Board ofProclamations, &amp;c.    Trade to submit to the Prime Minister the necessary Orders inCouncil and Proclamations giving effect to the above decisions.Raw Materials of . 8. The Minister of Munitions indicated a number of directionsMunitions. jn whieh imports on behalf of the Ministry of Munitions might be restricted, provided that a moderate amount of labour could beobtained, in particular, he indicated iron ore, nitrates, and pyrites.The War Cabinet decided that The Minister of Munitions should take steps to raise in theUnited Kingdom as much ore as was possible. They,invited Dr. Addison to place himself immediately in com-munication with the Director of National Service, with aview to the early organisation of labour for the develop-ment of home supplies of iron ore. Slate and stone quarriesand foreign labour were suggested as possible sourcesfrom which such labour might be obtained. The WarCabinet suggested that the Welsh Members of parliament should be consulted in this matter, and asked to render allpossible assistance.Paper.9. The War Cabinet recognise the view of Sir H. BabingtonSmith&apos;s Committee, that there are objections to a modification of theearlier decision that supplies to newspaper proprietors should be
reduced to one-third of those in 1914. They consider, however&apos;that A further reduction will be necessary, and they agree that thePrime Minister should give an indication of: this in his forthcoming statement in Parliament.Manufactures. 10. With reference to the decision of the War Cabinet of the16th February, 1917 (War Cabinet 70, Minute 1) on Lord Curzon&apos;sreport on the Restriction of Imports (G. 124) the War Cabinetconcur with Sir H. Babington Smith&apos;s Committee that The imposition of additional restrictions on manufactures, exceptluxuries, are not desirable, particularly having regard tothe fact that our Allies would, in the main, be injured.Glass Bottles. 11. The War Cabinet decided that-No further reduction should be made in the import of glassbottles. (Import was reduced by one-half by the decision in War Cabinet, 70, Minute 1.)Fruits and 12. The War Cabinet decided that Vegetables.   .No further reductions should be made in the quantities of fruit and vegetables to he imported, and, with regard to theDominions and Colonies, they requested the Secretary ofState for the Colonies to concert special arrangements asto the allocation of freight when full homeward-boundcargoes were not otherwise available.Grain for Horses. 13. The War Cabinet decided that -Sir BT. Babington Smith, in concert with the Food controller and the War Office, should report to the War Cabinet asto the best manner of investigating the question of the useof grain for feeding horses, not only in this country, hutalso in France. They invited him to take note of aproposal by Mr. Wintour that, as a preliminary step, a census of horses should be taken showing the numbersmaintained in the United Kingdom for the purposes ofbusiness and pleasure.The Effect of theRestrictions on theDominions,Colonies, Allies,and Neutrals.14. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Appendix II),explaining the difficulties caused with Allied and neutral nations,especially those whose products are luxuries for us, but necessities of existence to them and important items in the maintenance oftheir exchanges. He asked for a reconsideration of the WarCabineFs restrictions, particularly as regards France, in the case ofthose articles which require but little tonnage.Both the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and theSecretary of State for the Colonies drew attention to certain under-takings that had been given by the late Government in regard to restrictions on imports. The War Cabinet considered, however,that the changed conditions provided sufficient justification for achange of policy.While recognising the hardships inflicted on the producers ofthese goods in the Dominions and in Allied and neutral countries,the War Cabinet decided that-Having regard to the curtailment of unnecessary trade in thiscountry by the action of the Director of National Service,
Control of 15. The War Cabinet requested&quot; the President of the Board of licences: Trade to confer with Sir H. Babington Smith and render a jointreport as to the more efficient control of licences.National Service 16. The War Cabinet asked Mr. Henderson to confer with the campaign. Director of National Service with a view to the organisation of verylarge additional numbers of meetings in furtherance of the NationalService scheme.(Initialled) D. LI. G.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,February 22, 1917.* The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs wished it placed on record that hedissents from this decision.* and the hardships inflicted on the British people by the curtailment of unessentials, it would be impossible &quot;tojustify the import of articles (such as wine, millinery, &amp;&apos;c),which are mainly articles of luxury. *
Interdepartmental Committee on Restriction of Imports.WE submitted in our first report a scheme for reducing imports by 500,000 tons per month.We are now instructed to consider and to report to-day in what way imports canbe reduced by a further 500,000 tons in each of the last eight months of 1917.It is impossible without full enquiry to prepare a detailed programme. We canonly indicate the directions in which it is necessary to look for further reductions.Timber. After allowing for the reductions already proposed, the imports in 1917would be : 	Per Annum.	Per Month.Sawn timber      ..          ..          .. Pit timber	Tons. 2,650,000 1,720,000	Tons. 221.000 143,000Timber of this amount is available in the forests of the United &apos;Kingdom andFrance, but further increase in home production is limited, not only by the labour supply, but also by the carrying power of railways and other means of transport, andin the case of sawn timber by the amount of sawing plant available. The extent ofthe possible saving on the total imports depends on the extent to which these difficultiescan be overcome.We estimate that, if large additional supplies of labour are made available inFrance, the import of sawn timber can be considerably reduced, and we recommendthat all possible steps towards this end should be taken immediately ; but we cannot onthe data before us put forward any actual estimate of the reductions which will bethus effected.In this country the effort should first be concentrated on.the supply of pit-props.We think that if f0,000 men were made available, 1,000,000 tons might be extractedand placed on rail, in addition to the 300,000 tons already allowed for ; but we-doubtif the whole of this could be conveyed to the pits unless road transport was usedto supplement the railways. If it can be conveyed, this would give a saving of,80,000 tons per month.Paper. We understand that newspaper proprietors have already been informedthat their supplies will be reduced to one-third of those in 1914. - There are obvious objections to modifying this announcement. If these were not considered decisiveand a further reduction was considered necessary, we do not think it could exceed15,000 tons a month.Fruits and Vegetables. The imports of fresh fruit and vegetables remainingafter the reductions approved by the Cabinet would be about 230,000 tons for 1917,those of fruit (canned, bottled, and preserved) 22,000. We do not recommend totalexclusion, but even if this were decided upon it would not give a saving of more than21,000 tons per month.&quot; Luxury &quot; Foods. The imports remaining after the reduction approved amountto about 210,000 tons for 1917, of which 120,000 tons are tea. We do not think thatany considerable further reduction can be made in this class.Distilling. We understand that the question of redistilling young whisky toproduce the alcohol now derived from non-yeast-producing stills is being studied bythe Ministry of Munitions, but that besides the financial objection there are technical difficulties to be overcome. The maximum reduction of imports would be 12,000 tons per month.The question of stopping the potstills which are still working should also beconsidered. But until these questions are further advanced we cannot include anysaving of tonnage on their accounts.Manufactures. No great saving of tonnage can be obtained by any increasedrestrictions.   Indeed, we understand that possible concessions to the Allies are under
APPENDIX II.Prohibition op Imports.Memorandum by Mr. Balfour.IT was not till the discussion in Cabinet on Friday (the 16th) that I realised theprinciples on which the Committee had acted in framing their recommendations onthe Restriction of Imports.I had supposed that their sole object was to secure an adequate supply ofnecessaries to this country and her Allies by freeing tonnage, as nearly as possible, upto 500,000 tons a month, now occupied in carrying articles not of primary necessity.It appears, however, that I was mistaken, and that two additional principles were taken into account when the Committee made their recommendations : the principlethat luxuries, as such, should be excluded on the ground that in war-time theconsumption of luxuries was not only unnecessary but harmful, and the principlethat the importation of valuable commodities, even though they &apos; occupied no[1365-77] Dconsideration. The total exclusion of glass bottles, instead of 50 per cent, as proposed,would save a further 4,000 tons per month.Food and Feeding-Stuffs. A reduction of food or feeding-stuffs, to the extentof 67,000 tons per month, was included as part of the original scheme for saving500,000 tons per month.It is clear that the further reductions for saving an additional 500,000 tons per month would have to come, to a large extent, under this category.The Food Controller is discussing with the Board of Agriculture the otherreductions which could be effected, but they are not prepared as yet to formulate any detailed programme. The Food Controller indicates, however, the following as the directions in which we must look for savings : Feeding-Stuffs for Farm Stock. A considerable further reduction would bepossible here.   It would involve (1.) Shorter period of fattening;(2.) Reduction of stock of cattle, sheep, and pigs ; and,   -(3.) Unless special precautions were taken, risk of reduction in the milk supply.Grain for Horses. The amount used, both home-grown and imported, is estimatedat 5,000,000 tons per annum equal to the importation of wheat.Meat. The reduction of feeding-stuffs would be coincident with the increased rate of killing cattle.   This would (temporarily) reduce the imports of meat.Total -prohibition of brewing, if thought practicable, would save 32,000 tons per&apos;month; but as barley for this years brewing has already been malted, the reduction would not be effective except so far as malted barley can be used for feeding animals.Sugar. Some reduction could be made by reducing the allowance for confectionery-stationery, but for any large reduction rationing would be necessary. The whole import(less that used for brewing) was 1,400,000 tons in 1916.The Food Controller is not prepared at present to estimate the possible savingunder these heads, but it would certainly not be sufficient, with the other possiblesavings we have indicated, to give the desired total. The further reduction necessaryfor this purpose would mean a large deduction from the staple foods of the country.It is not clear that there is a sufficient margin to allow for such a reduction, and, inany case, it could, we believe, only be carried out by a system of compulsory rationing.We have hitherto assumed that no reduction is possible in the large imports,especially of metals and iron ore, for munitions and other military purposes. Theseamounted in 1916 to over 10,000,000 tons, apart from direct Government imports.We think that a very close scrutiny of these imports is necessary ; in particular wesuggest that the substitution of British iron ore for imported ore should be further considered by the Ministry of Munitions.February 21, 1917.
appreciable fraction of our shipping, was injurious, because it rendered the problemof exchange more difficult to deal with.Now, I am in full agreement with both these principles, and I am far fromunderrating their importance, but they do not rank, in my judgment, with the more fundamental principle that tonnage must be economised on a great scale. To this principle we must give effect, however unpopular it may be either at home or abroad,and whatever interests it may effect, whether those of our Allies, our Colonies, orof the producers and consumers in this country. But the other two principles havenot this absolute character. Obedience to them is not a matter of life and death, but of comparative advantage and disadvantage ; and I do not think that the Cabinet haverealised how serious the disadvantages are from the point of view of the ForeignOffice, and probably also (though on this point I have no special title to speak) fromthe point of view of our dependencies also.It must be remembered that what are luxuries to the consumers may be, and often are, necessaries to the producer. It is alleged I have no means of tesiing the truth of the statement-that there are large sections of the population in France, Italy,Switzerland, Spain, and Portugal who would be thrown out of employment or reduced to destitution if we refused to import the articles of luxury enumerated inthe report. Such a prospect must greatly disturb the Governments concerned. we ourselves certainly should not view with equanimity the stoppage of cotton-spinningin Lancashire. Moreover, we have some experience in this matter, for our earlier andmilder attempts to carry out this policy met with protests so violent that we had towhittle down our original proposals by the freest use of a system of licences wherebywhat was forbidden in bulk was permitted in detail; without doubt something of thesame sort will happen again; loud cries will be uttered by the workmen wholose, or expect to lose, their employment ; the cries will be taken up by their Govern-ments ; an embittered diplomatic controversy may follow, injuriously affecting othernegotiations going on between the Allies, and loosening the ties of sentiment thatbind them together; concessions will have to be made, licences on a large scale willhave to be issued, and we shall finally settle down to a state of things in which verylittle tonnage will have been saved, and much bad blood will have been created.Moreover, as the Committee point out, we are hampered by arrangements alreadycome to with Italy and France. These arrangements were never communicated to theForeign Office, aud the Board of Trade, which was responsible for them, appear tohave no very clear records of their character. We must hope that, on the face ofthem, they were temporary, so that they will not stand in the way of the new system.But Ave shall cot apparently know for certain unless and until our Allies give us theirversion of what passed.There is another difficulty to which, so far as I remember, the Committee make no reference, and that is the difficulty which arises from the most-favoured-nation clause, which is an integral part of all our commercial treaties. These treaties are intended to secure, and have secured, equality of treatment in our dealings with ourneighbours, and we may readily admit that there is nothing in total prohibitioninconsistent with this principle. But this cannot be said of total prohibition qualifiedby licences extended to one country, but not in equal measure to another. Only alawyer can say whether this system is in accordance with the letter of our treaties, but any man of common sense can see that it is wholly inconsistent with their spirit, and i fear that many international difficulties may follow on its adoption.I cannot think, therefore, that anyone who surveys this policy impartially candoubt ils difficulties and its dangers. The only point is whether even greater difficulties and dangers would not follow if it were rejected and goods which employedlittle tonnage were freely admitted. Now, what are the objections to such a course ?They are: 1. Injury to exchange ;2. Acquiescence in luxurious expenditure ; and3. Misuse of tonnage.All these are real evils, but, are they greater than those on the other side ?As regards the exchanges, I am not qualified to speak, nor have I at my disposalany facts or figures bearing on the subject. It was barely referred to at Friday&apos;cabinet. But, as regards the encouragement of, or acquiescence in, expenditure onluxury, it has to be observed that, in some cases at least, the articles of fuxury, theimportation of which we forbid, will be more or less successfully produced at home,and this carries with it the further disadvantage that we shall be accused of using
this weapon of prohibition as a means for encouraging our own industries. It will beregarded, not as a measure of military self-defence, but as commercial protectionunder another name.All these objections would no doubt sink into insignificance if the amount oftonnage affected were important. But I understand that this is scarcely the case.Much cause of offence could be avoided without throwing any burden worth speakingof on the world&apos;s shipping. I therefore suggest that while we should proceed boldlyand rapidly with the prohibition of such commodities as timber and other bulkyarticles we shoxdd move cautiously in dealing with articles which mean much whenmeasured in terms of Allied or neutral prosperity, but little when measured in termsof available tonnage.
