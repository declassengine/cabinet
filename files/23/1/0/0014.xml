Dally Jones, Assistant Secretary.Mr. T. Jones, Assistant Secretary.Untried Irish The Chief Secretary for Ireland made a statement to the WarPrisoners. Cabinet in regard to the untried Irish prisoners interned in GreatBritain in consequence of the recent rebellion.    A summary of thestatement is printed in the Appendix.The War Cabinet considered the question from the point ofview of the effect of release on Ireland itself ; on Imperial policy ;on American relations ; and on the Parliamentary situation as awhole.In regard to the purely Irish aspect of the question, the WarCabinet were particularly influenced by the following considerationsurged by the Chief Secretary : 1. That rebellion in Ireland is practically impossible at thepresent time.2. That the danger in Ireland can be limited by the applicationof safeguards under the Defence of the Realm Act.8. That there is more danger in keeping the prisoners internedthan in releasing them. The feeling in Ireland in regardto this matter is due rather to pity than to any agreement in the seditious views of the prisoners.4. That their release would help rather than hinder theapplication of Compulsory Service to Ireland.[1365-15]
From the Imperial point of view, the War Cabinet were moreespecially influenced by the fact that, according to reliable information, failure to release the prisoners earlier contributedlargely to the defeat of the proposals for Compulsory Service in.Australia.The War Cabinet also consider the question from the point ofview of the Peace Note recently received from the Government of theUnited States of America. They considered it would be desirable totake any&quot; action which&apos; m^ght tend to foster the impression inthe United States, as well as at home, that the new Government was approaching the Irish question in a generous but not timorousspirit.From the Parliamentary standpoint, the War Cabinet could notignore the fact that a general impression has been created that afavourable decision would be given on this question immediately.The War Cabinet authorised the Chief Secretary for Ireland tomake a statement in the sense that the whole of the prisoners would be released, subject to such safeguards,under the Defence of the Realm Act, as may be deemed necessary ; that the question had been before the late government for a considerable time ; and that, had it notbeen for the recent indisposition of the Prime Minister, astatement in the same sense as the present one would havebeen made in both Houses of Parliament on Tuesday last.Mr. Duke was requested to show clearly in his statement that this decision was an act of grace and conciliation.(Initialled) D.

APPENDIX TO THE WAR CABINET, 14.Untried Irish Prisoners.Frongoch and Reading..ABOUT 3,000 were arrester] during the rebellion ; 1,000 (roughly) were releasedimmediately. Under 2,000 were brought to England. The Advisory Committeereleased all but 580, for various reasons. These have been further reduced to about530 prisoners, the number now interned. The police resist all releases at present, but with different degrees of resistance according to the character of the different classesof the men. Half of the men are, in my judgment, not seriously dangerous, though they will no doubt be troublesome. Of the remainder something like a fifth are activepeople of ability who helped to organise the rebellion, and can be relied on to cause trouble to His Majesty&apos;s Government by seditious conspiracy, by communication withthe enemy, or, if they see any opening, by armed action. Probably the introduction of compulsory service would give them their opportunity. The Nationalist party ispledged absolutely and definitely to resist compulsion, and its adherents in all partssupport this pledge.Besides the guiding spirits whom I have last mentioned and the men of the rank and file mentioned first, the residue are active and resolute rebels, who, if they get a lead and have a chance, will no doubt take up arms.Nearly half the total number of men are from Dublin, and the concentration ofthese in a city like Dublin is of course a thing I should have liked to avoid. Thepolice would not oppose the release of some of these. Small sections come fromscattered centres where small societies and rebellious combinations always exist, and where things have lately been happily quiet. Speaking broadly, there is no doubtthat the hostile forces are dying down in Ireland.Before the question of release became a question of more than domestic concern,1 was ready to recommend that steps should be taken progressively for the release,first of all, of the men of the rank and file, by giving them individually leave to returnto Ireland without actually revoking the internment orders ; those who misbehavedcould in that &quot;way be recommitted to imprisonment without a new order from the HomeSecretary. Such an order could not probably now be justified under D.R. Regulations,if it were newly made and challenged in a Court of Law.As to the residue I should have been ready by a progressive process to havereleased them, reserving under D. R. Regulations such control over their place of residence and movements as would have prevented their being a serious danger. Ihave taken measures of this kind in other cases, and have broken up combinationswhich threatened to be mischievous.People in Ireland of the most unimpeachable loyalty have urged upon me that the prisoners should be released, on the ground that they have been sufficiently punished.If it is regarded as important upon grounds of external as well as internal policy to decide upon the release of Frongoch, 1 think it would still be necessary to regulate the release so that (a.) No undue strain should be put upon the resources of the police ;(b.) Security for means of observation on the movements of the released men couldbe taken; and(c.) In the case of a certain small minority of men restriction could be placed upon their free choice of residence.. It would probably meet the necessities of the case if an announcement were made that the Government has resolved upon the release of the prisoners, that the necessary arrangements will require consideration, and that releases will commence withoutdelay.11.
