Agriculture:Guaranteed prices for Wheat, Oats,and Potatoes.Minimum Wage.1. THE War Cabinet continued tbe discussion on agricultural policy begun on the 15th February, with special reference to thequestion of guaranteed prices and minimum wages.Mr. Strutt reported that the farmers whom he had consultedwere willing to pay a minimum wage (including allowances) of25.?. per week, provided that they received minimum prices for theircrops. They considered that the question had really been settled,in a sense, by the action of the Director of National Service.The Prime Minister stated that he had received a visit from lord Chaplin, who said that what the farmer needed was a guaranteed price. Lord Chaplin thought that probably not muchcould be done in any case in the way of increased production thisyear, as the land required cleaning. The farmer would not beginbreaking up ;land until he received his guarantee. Lord Chaplinwas strongly opposed to the Government fixing a price below whichthey would not commandeer produce.Mr. Harling Turner, the Duke of Portlands agent, stated thata minimum wage was an essential part of the policy, and would prove ultimately to the advantage of the farmer, in which connection he instanced the good profits made from farming in Scotland, wherewages are high. Mr. Turner also strongly supported the need ofa minimum price for a period of not less than five years, andpreferably for more. He considered the prices decided on by theWar Cabinet on the 15th February (War Cabinet, 66, Minute 1 (a) )to be fair to everyone.Captain Bathurst, who stated that he represented in the Houseof Commons a constituency containing some of the worst-paidagricultural labourers in the country, said that there was an increasing appreciation among farmers of the probability that if thelabourer were better paid he would give better work. The moreenlightened were in favour of a Wage Board, because it would placefarmers on an equal footing.Prices forCommandeeredProduce.2. The War Cabinet next considered the decision arrived at on15th February (War Cabinet, 66, Minute 1 (c) ). After hearing theviews of the experts present the War Cabinet revised their decision that the Government should undertake not to commandeer produceduring 1917, 1918, and 1919 below fixed prices, and, instead, they decided that The price should be announced from time to time by the WarOffice or Food Controller after the approval of the EnglishBoard of Agriculture and Fisheries, the Scottish Board ofAgriculture, and the Department of Agriculture andTechnical Instruction for Ireland had been obtained.Pheasants. 3. The War Cabinet, having heard the views of a number of experts, including Mr. Prothero, Lord Selborne, Captain Bathurst,Mr. Harling Turner, Sir Arthur Lee, and Mr. A. D. Hall, andhaving received details of a precedent adopted by the Secretaryfor Scotland in the case of deer, decided that The Board of Agriculture and Fisheries should be responsiblefor seeing that agricultural production is not reduced bythe depredations of game, and should take such measures as are required to that end.Having regard to the statement already made on the subject inthe House of Commons by Captain Bathurst, it is desirablethat, in any Order issued by the Board of Agriculture andFisheries, powers should be taken to empower tenants, atthe bidding of the Board, to kill pheasants in cases wherelandowners had failed to carry out the instructions of theBoard.
Prices of Potatoes. 4, The Prime Minister read a telegram which he had receivedfrom the Lord Mayor of Manchester with reference to the deadlockwhich had arisen in regard to the delivery of potatoes.Captain Bathurst reported to the War Cabinet that the factswere as follows : The price which the Food Controller had fixed tobe paid to the former was 8Z. per ton for the best sound potatoes.This allowed a considerable margin above the cost of production,which would not be more than 51. or 51. 10s., and would yield a bigger profit than was obtained in peace time. The only otherprice fixed by the Food Controller was l^cl. per lb., or 14Z.per ton, as the price to be charged to the consumer, this price to come into operation on Monday next, the 19th February. Thedifference of 61. per ton left a handsome margin for all themiddlemen concerned. The price SI. was for potatoes on theground, and it was true that some farmers were taking advantageof the scarcity of supply and the urgent demand to charge abnormalrates for cartage, in rare cases as much as 31. per ton. Dealerswho allege that they have paid more than 81. per ton, and that theycannot afford to sell at 14Z., have only themselves to blame, for theposition was made quite clear, and they have had ample time tounload their stocks. The War office commandeered potatoes forthe Army at SZ. per ton.Mr. Strutt stated that in the three months preceding the issueof the Order, potatoes had been selling at about 101. to 111. perton, and the sudden drop to 81. without warning had been felt bythe growers as a.grievance, especially by,the small growers.Mr. Harling Turner said that the potato crop was a mostspeculative one, and might vary in two consecutive seasons fromeight to two tons an acre.Mr. Hall said that if growers were compelled to sell, it would only mean an earlier exhaustion of stocks, and there were onlystocks for two months in the country. The next crop would not be forthcoming till July, so the country might be without potatoes for two months. There must be a serious potato shortage in any case.There was also a danger of a serious shortage of seed potatoes.The Chief Secretary for Ireland said that the Irish crop wasonly two-thirds of the normal crop, and, as speculation in Englandthreatened to leave Ireland in want, an Order was issued to prohibitexport. Dealings in Ireland are restricted ; the needs of the armyare supplied, and the Department of Agriculture is saving seed.When these needs have been met, he thought Ireland wotdd be ableto spare some potatoes for export.The War Cabinet decided that The Board of Agriculture and the Ministry of Food, inconsultation with their advisers, should consider thequestion in the first instance and make an immediatereport to the War Cabinet, considering the question fromthe point of view of general policy in regard to theshortage of potatoes, as well as of the situation arising outof the present crisis.Irish Agriculture: 5. The War Cabinet, having heard from the Chief Secretary forGuaranteed Prices    Ireland particulars of the very special characteristics of Ireland,and &quot;Wage Boards.     both as regards farming and, more particularly, the very low rate ofwages there, decided that (a.) The system of guaranteed prices should apply to Ireland asto Great Britain.(6.) At this stage it would not be advisable to apply theminimum wage of 25s. per week to Ireland, but thatWage Boards should be established, with the object of raising wages in Ireland.
o6. The&apos;War Cabinet decided that Minute 1 (d) of War Cabinet, 66, should be in suspense for thepresent.(Initialled) D. LI. G.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,February 17, 1917.
