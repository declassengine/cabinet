THE Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read a communi-cation from the Russian Embassy, covering a communication fromBaron Sonnino, indicating that M. Rizoff, who has recently been in communication with the Russian Minister in Stockholm, was wellknown in the Italian Foreign Office to be a worthless and unreliablemedium, who would pass on any communication he received to theGerman Government, who in turn would use it for their own purposes with their allies.
Greece- 2. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs stated that he had had an interview with M. Gennadius and M. Diomedes, the finance minister of the Greek Provisional Government, who had suggested the possibility of a rising in Thessaly now that the Royalist troops were to be withdrawn, and had asked what the attitude of the allies would be in view of the fact that the Allies had compelled theGreek Government to withdraw their troops. The Secretary ofState reported that he had telegraphed to the British&apos; Ambassador&apos;   at Athens for his views.Field-marshal sir Douglas Haig&apos;s interview.3. The War Cabinet requested the Secretary of State for war to ask Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig to report to them the factsregarding his alleged interview with a representative of HavasAgencies, as reported in this morning&apos;s newspapers.Lord Balfour of 4. The War Cabinet decided that on CommSercial0and The Report of Lord Balfour of Burleigh&apos;s Committee, of theIndustrial Policy. &apos; 2nd February,   on  Commercial  and   Industrial Policy,should be laid on the table of the House of Commons.(The questions of policy raised in the Report werereserved for further consideration.)Air Raids.5.

E. kiggel, the Chief of the General Staff to the british expeditionary Force, who had been sent by the Field-marshal commanding-in-Chief to represent the gravity of the situationin regard to the French railways.The War Cabinet decided To adhere to the policy decided on at the previous Meeting(War Cabinet, 65, Minute 4).They decided, however, in addition, that Whatever might be the result of the Conference between sir Douglas Haig and General Nivelle, it was desirableto hold a Conference with the French Government on thesubject, and they authorised the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff to inform Sir Douglas Haig in this sense.Man-Power. 7. The Secretary of State for  War handed to the PrimeMinister the draft despatch to the Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief the British Expeditionary Force, communicating to him the particulars regarding the number of men actually made availablefor the Army by the decision of the War Cabinet, prepared inconformity of the decision of the War Cabinet on 13th February,1917 (War Cabinet, 64, Minute 8).In view of the great importance of this despatch, the PrimeMinister reserved it for consideration in the afternoon.** Its issue was subsequently approved subject to the insertion by the Secretaryof State for War of a paragraph indicating the difficulties which confronted theGovernment in the matter of man-power.

The War Cabinet decided that-GovernmentDepartments. In view of the great pressure of war work on all GovernmentDepartments, it wotild not be justifiable, having regardto the immense amount of labour involved, to compile acomplete return of the number and status of the staff,permanent and temporary, of the new Government Offices,as asked for in Parliament.The case would be met by a general statement in Parliament,and by an announcement in regard to the Committee under sir Joseph Compton-Rickett to enquire into the staffs ofthe new Government Departments.Reconstruction. 10. The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that he wasabout to appoint a new Reconstruction Committee, which would replace the old Reconstruction Committee.

The War Cabinet take note of the decision of the Secretaryof State for India, on the advice of the India Council and theGovernment of India, that the original scheme for the building ofNew Delhi should be proceeded with, but allowing a longer time forits completion than was originally intended.Consultation with 15. The War Cabinet had a preliminary discussion in regard the Dominions and    to the proceedings of the Special Imperial War Cabinet Meetings.India. The Secretary of State for the Colonies was not yet in a position tosay when all the representatives of the Dominions would arrive.General Smuts could not be here much before the end of March, andMr. Hughes was not yet quite certain whether he would be able tocome, and if he could come was not likely to reach this countryuntil some time in April. On the other hand, Sir Robert Bordenand Sir E. Morris would be arriving very soon. The question of accommodation for the Oversea representatives was discussed,and the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Secretary of Statefor India undertook to consider, with the Secretary of the WarCabinet, the provision of a room where the Oversea representatives and their staffs could meet.The War Cabinet approved generally the proposals of theSecretary (Appendix I) as to the information to be prepared invarious Departments, with regard to which he stated that he hadalready written informally to the Heads of the Departments,concerned. They also approved generally the list of existing docu-ments which the Secretary suggested should be sent to theDominion representatives.With regard to the procedure at the Meetings, the War Cabinetinclined to the view that the proceedings should open by a generalsynopsis by the Prime Minister of the military effort made by theUnited Kingdom, which should include a general review of theNaval and Military situation. They did not consider that it wouldbe necessary for special separate statements to be made at theImperial War Cabinet Meetings on the Naval and Military situation,apart from the Prime Ministers statement, but that such special,statements might be furnished if required, and that in any case the
[1365-67]CFirst Sea Lord and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff shouldbe prepared either to answer questions at the Meeting or to givethe representatives of the Dominions and India any specialinformation they might require. The War Cabinet further considered that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should beprepared to give a general review of foreign policy.(Initialled)      D. LI. Q.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,February 15, 1917.
Agenda tor the&apos; Forthcoming Special War Cabinet Meetings withRepresentatives of the Dominions and India.Note by the Secretary.THE Colonial Office telegrams indicate that the Special War Cabinet meetings with representatives of the Dominions and India may commence about the second week in March. I venture to submit some preliminary observations for the considerationof the War Cabinet with a view, more particularly, to the preparation of materialsrequired for the Conference.The telegram sent by the Colonial Office and India Office on the subject of theAgenda is reproduced in the Appendix.2. From this it will be seen that the deliberations of the War Cabinet will fallbroadly under three heads :-I. Increased effort during the War.II. The Terms of Peace.III. Post bellum Conditions.3. As regards the first, it is presumed that the War Cabinet will, in the firstinstance, wish to place the representatives of the Dominions and India in full possessionof all the facts regarding the Naval, Military, Political, and Economic situation, bothof the enemy and of the Allies. It is submitted, however, that a great deal of this information would better be communicated verbally rather than in the form of memoranda, partly owing to its secrecy and partly owing to the desirability of notflooding the Overseas representatives with a mass of literature which they will find it difficult to read and digest.4. As a basis for this part of the discussion, it is suggested that the Memorandashould be confined in the main to questions of fact, which can be used, as it were, asworks of reference during the Cabinet Meetings. The information might be sent forthunder the following heads : (1.) The facts regarding naval co-operation rendered by the Dominions and India,with indications of further directions in which co-operation could be given.This would be prepared by the Admiralty.(2.) The facts regarding the military co-operation of the Dominions and India,with indications of any directions in which further co-operation might begiven.   This would be prepared by the General Staff.(3.) The facts regarding co-operation in shipbuilding, with indications as tofurther possible developments. This would be provided by the ShippingController.(4.) The facts regarding co-operation in the prodrtction of food, with suggestionsby the Food Controller and the President of the Board of Agriculture andFisheries.(5.) The facts regarding financial assistance given by the Dominions and India,with suggestions by the Treasury.(6.) The facts regarding co-operation by the Dominions and India in the provisionof munitions, with suggestions by the Minister of Munitions.(7.) The facts regarding any other form of co-operation by the Dominions andIndia outside the above headings might be given by the Colonial Officeand India Office respectively.(8.) The facts regarding the co-operation of the Crown Colonies, Dependencies, &amp;c.This would be prepared by the Colonial Office.It is for consideration also whether, conversely, the facts under each headingregarding Imperial assistance to the Dominions and India should not be given.5. It is suggested that, following the highly successful precedent of the meetings at the Committee of Imperial Defence in 1911, the first meeting should open with aseries bf general statements regarding the strategical, political, and economies situation,
which might be made by the Prime Minister (whose statement might usefully include a recapitulation of the far-reaching economic and other measures taken in this country),the First Sea Lord, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, the Secretary of State for&apos; Foreign Affairs, and the Minister of Blockade, respectively. Perhaps also Lord Curzonwould make a statement on such matters as mercantile shipping, restriction of imports,and aerial warfare, and Lord Milner might say something about Russia. these statements might be followed up by a summing-up by the Prime Minister of theparticular questions which on our part we wish the Dominions to consider; and an invitation for them to offer suggestions to us, after which, no doubt, a general discussionwordd ensue.6. Probably a large number of the suggestions would have to be remitted, eitherto Special Sub-Committees or Conferences, or to the parallel Conferences proceeding atthe Colonial Office and the India Office.7. With regard to the second group of questions relating to Peace, it is suggestedthat the only memoranda to be furnished should be the following:  A translation of the reply by the Allies to President Wilson.Sir Louis MalleFs Interim Report and Final Report on Territorial Changes outside europe.The Board of Trade Memorandum on Economic Desiderata in the Terms of Peace,and Professor Ashley&apos;s Memoranda on Indemnities.The Report of Lord Balfour of Burleigh&apos;s Economic Sub-Committee of theReconstruction Committee.The Reconstruction Committee&apos;s Report on Germany&apos;s after-war policy.8. It isisuggested, however, that early in these discussions the Prime Minister orthe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should make a full verbal statement covering the following subjects : The Agreements made in regard to Constantinople and Turkey ;The Agreement with Italy ;The Agreement with Roumania ;The desiderata of the Allies, so far as they known, and of ourselves in regard toterritorial and economic changes, more particularly those affecting Belgium,Alsace-Lorraine, Poland, and the Balkans.9. There are several matters on which the Government itself has not yet con-sidered in relation to the terms of peace. For example, there is the big question ofpolicy as to whether we are to aim at some sort of international organisation, such as a league to enforce peace, or a league of the character of the Concert of Europe formedafter 1815; or, alternatively, something in the nature&apos; of a balance of power; thefinancial arrangements between the Allies and ourselves, and the question whether weshould use these as a lever to bargain for territorial or other advantages; the questionof ton for ton, and any naval desiderata. It would seem very probable that some ofthese questions will be raised at the Conference. I should like the instructions of theWar Cabinet as to whether any material should be prepared in connection with any ofthem.10. As regards the third group of post helium problems, it is understood that theywill probably, to a large extent, be discussed outside the Imperial War Cabinet, andthat the Colonial Office have already been in communication with other departments on the various subjects. Perhaps the most immediate of these is Demobilisation. the demobilisation Sub-Committee of the Reconstruction Committee is, I understand, atpresent in abeyance, pending a decision on the future work of the reconstruction committee, but both the Ministry of Labour and the War Office are actively at work.One question which may have to be discussed in the War Cabinet is that of theconstitution of the British Empire, if it is raised by any of the Dominions and it is included in the general programme sent to the Dominions and India; but I would submit that, in the first instance, it would be more usefully raised at the Special war conference at the Colonial Office, which is fully conversant with the past history ofthis qriestion and its difficulties.id. Other questions which would, in the first instance at any rate, fall, ratherwithin the scope of the special War Conference at the Colonial Office would include :Commercial, industrial, and shipping policy after the war, emigration (includingcoloured emigration), Imperial communications, AU-Red Route, cables, &amp;c, naturalisation-tion, organisation of Consular and Intelligence Services, and any other subjects which
the Colonial Office and the Dominion Governments may consider it desirable to raise,and finally the constitutional problem itself.I have already written Informally to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs, Secretary of State for the Colonies, Secretary of State forIndia, Minister of Blockade, First Sea Lord, Chief of the Imperial General Staff,Minister of Munitions, Shipping Controller, Food Controller, and President of theBoard of Agriculture and Fisheries, suggesting, for their consideration, the desirabilityof getting together the material for the various documents suggested in this note, andI should be glad to have the approval of the War Cabinet in order to place tbe matter on a more formal footing, and also to receive any further instructions.(Initialled) M.
