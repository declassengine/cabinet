The War Cabinet had under consideration the telegramsImmediate action.    from the British Minister at Athens printed in Appendix 1 relatingto Greece.   The War Cabinet were unable to concur in Sir FrancisTL365-4J - B
2Elliot&apos;s suggestions for the inclusion in a single Ultimatum of allthe Allied demands relating both to the measures for the securityof the Allied Army based on Salonica, and to reparation for therecent outrages. While recognising the force of the arguments; given by Sir Francis Elliot, they consider that the safety of theAllied Armies is of paramount importance, and that everything elsemust be subordinated to it.The War Cabinet reached the following decisions : (a.) The Foreign Office to instruct the British Minister at Athensthat the original Ultimatum contained in Foreign office telegram No. 1465, dated the 9th December, 1916, shouldbe presented to the Greek Government as it stands, theFrench aud Russian Governments having agreed to thiscourse. This Ultimatum should be accompanied by an explanatory Memorandum to be drafted by the allied military Attaches at Athens as proposed by Sir FrancisElliot. This explanatory Memorandum should containfull details as to the measures necessary for giving full effect to the Ultimatum. In drafting it, the MilitaryAttaches should be instructed to- keep the following considerations in view : (1.) All guns and their munitions must be withdrawnfrom Thessaly.(2.) Only sufficient troops should be left in Thessalyfor police purposes, and the number shouldbe reduced to the minimum essential.(b.) Telegram No. 1493, dated the 12th December, 1916, fromthe Foreign Office to the British Minister at Athens, was approved, authorising him to demand the release of theVenizelists in prison, and that they and all others whodesire it should be allowed to leave for Salonica or elsewhere, provided his colleagues agree, but insistingthat on no account must the presentation of the Ultimatumcontained in Foreign Office telegram No. 1465, dated the9th December, be delayed.(c.) No time should be lost in deciding on the measures inregard to the exaction of reparation for the recentoutrages. Lord Gurzon and Lord Milner undertook, in concert with the heads of the Foreign Office, to formulatea scheme of action on the basis of the various proposalshy the British and French Governments and the ministers at Athens.  -Future Policy. 3. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theForeign Office, dated the 11th December, 1916, on future policy inregard to Greece (Appendix II). The question alluded to in thefirst paragraph of this Memorandum namely, the military measuresto safeguard the rear and flank of the Salonica force-has alreadybeen dealt with.With reference to the third paragraph, the War cabinet decided that the Foreign Office should make a communication to theAllied Governments in the sense that we propose, for practical reasons, to recognise in London a diplomatic agent as representingM. Venizelos&apos;s Government, and we hope that they have noobjections.4. The War Cabinet decided that the remaining questions inthe Foreign Office Memorandum should stand over for the moment,
the first step being to obtain direct diplomatic intercourse with--M.&apos; Venizelos, as proposed in the previous clause.Greek Merchant 5. Lord Robert Cecil drew the attention of the War Cabinet to ships. f]ie report of a conference held on the 11th December at the ForeignOffice, in which it had been recommended that all Greek ships inthe. hands of the Allies should be transferred to the Allied flags andutilised in the Allied interests (Appendix III).The War Cabinet approved in principle a general policy of transferring Greek ships to Allied flags, and relegated the details toan Interdepartmental Committee composed of representatives of theForeign Office, Admiralty, and the Shipping Director. The ForeignOffice to take the necessary action to assemble this Committee.Slavs from the 6. With reference to Conclusion No. 4 of the 20th November,United States. tte 0f ^e Imperial General Staff reported that the question had arisen as to payment for the maintenance of the Serbians,obtained from the United States, during their detention in Canadaprior to embarkation for Salonica. He stated that the Treasury had agreed to pay a total sum not exceeding 500,000 fr. for this service,but the War Office could not say whether that would prove to besufficient or not.The War Cabinet decided that the expense of maintenancemust be borne by the Treasury, even if it should exceed the summentioned.(Initialled) D.

Telegram from Sir F. Elliot (Athens), December 12, 1916.MY colleagues and I are unanimously of opinion that ultimatum as worded inyour telegram No. 1465 of 9th December is so vague as inevitably to lead either to immediate discussion or ultimate misunderstanding. It is necessary to define what is meant by &quot;Greek troops now stationed in Thessaly.&quot; It should include all guns,munitions, stores, &amp;c, as well as the three regiments which the King promised towithdraw, if they have [? omitted : not] already moved. It should exclude whatevertroops are necessary for maintenance of order.We [? propose] that Military Attache should draft ultimatum on the basis of principles laid down in your telegram, but complete with details necessary to avoidmisconception.Italian Minister says that his Government object to phrase &quot;failure to complywith these two demands will be regarded by Allies as an act of hostility.&quot;Telegram from Sir F. Elliot (Athens), December 12, 1916.YOUR telegram No. 1486 of 12th December.My colleagues and I offer following suggestions : French proposals : &quot;1. &quot;Complete disarmament&quot; would certainly be refused. Moreover, is itnecessary, once the whole Greek army is concentrated with armament and munitionsin Morea ?2. We agree with Russian Government in deprecating seizure of hostages.3. Punishment of the guilty ; desirable but difficult to ensure.4. Indemnities for victims. What victims? If, British and French soldiers,demand is unusual. If Allied subjects, we know of no killed or wounded, and not much loss of property. I have case of Captain Mackenzie and one or two others. IfVenizelists, that opens up a large cmestion.Your proposals :(a.) Agreed ; but we are uncertain whether commander of army corps crcommander of [P division] is person responsible.(6.) Orders for dismissal of so-called reservist volunteers are said to have been already issued. If dissolution of reservist leagues is what is meant, my colleagues areunanimously of opinion that it would be futile to demand it, as they would be revivedas political or [? other] clubs.Punishment for complicity approved, but considered difficult to obtain.(c.) Agreed to, but no Greek court-martial will convict.(d.) Accepted.(e.) Russian Minister is opposed to re-establishment of controls. French andItalian Ministers doubt expediency of attempting it, except as regards commercial matters, as to which no difficulty will be made. I regard it as most desirable, if not essential, but I recognise that it will encounter great resistance. Controls could be rendered less vexatious by better methods;(/.) By &quot;unless action is taken within three days,&quot; it is presumed that a&quot; commencement of execution &quot; is meant. Penalty for impediment to execution hasbeen already stated to be maintenance of blockade.Questions of ultimate position of King and recognition of Provisional government we regarded as hardly within our province.I informed my colleagues of suggestions in my telegram No. 2002&apos; of 12th Decemberfor release of Venizelists, but found them lukewarm. I beg, however, strongly to insist on it.
It has to he considered whether balance of advantage lies in putting forwarddrastic demands, which may lead to immediate rupture, or in being satisfied withincomplete guarantees, which may only put off the evil day. This is question for militaryauthorities.Telegram from Sir F. Elliot (Athens), December 12, 1916.MY immediately preceding telegram.A further observation I have to make is this. Unless all demands are put forward in one ultimatum position will be complicated. On being presented with demand for withdrawal of troops to Morea, coupled with statement that there are further demands *to follow, Greeks may say: &quot; Why should we abandon a relatively strong position and put ourselves at your mercy, before we know whether your further demands will be such as we can accept ? &quot;Position of Legations will be peculiar if we embark on presenting first ultimatum,landing again when it is accepted, and wrait perhaps for days if not weeks in ablockaded city while second is being discussed; a transport waiting for us all thetime which might be better employed. British colony on board &quot; VasilefsConstantinos &quot; are growing impatient for directions wdiether to leave or to disembark,and cannot be kept on board indefinitely ; moreover, Greeks are refusing to provisionthe ship, yet their disembarkation would be regarded as a sign that we are prepared,to come to terms with Greek Government.APPENDIX II.Memorandum by the Foreign Office on Future Policy in Greece, December 11, 1916.(Secret.)1. The urgent thing is to take such military measures as may be necessary tosafeguard the rear and flank of the Salonica force. With this object in view, it hasalready been decided to demand the withdrawal of all Greek troops from ThessalyWhat other measures may be necessary it is for the military authorities to decide.Guidance from them is also essential as to wdiat steps should be taken to satisfyourselves that this demand, if complied with, is really carried out. Is it, for instance,proper or sufficient to send Military Attaches to Thessaly ?2. The next thing to settle is what is to be done with King Oonstantine. We must,it is submitted, act on the assumption that he is definitely pro-German, and that his present object is to gain time so that the German-Bulgarian attack may develop, andhe may then be able to assist it from the south. Even if this is not his fixedintention, he has been so treated, notably by the French, and his followers have socommitted themselves, that it would be insanity to hope for anything like loyalco-operation wdth him in the future. On the other hand, he has a considerablebody of troops at his disposal, and it is thought that the difficulties of militaryoperations against him would be considerable, and that such operations would be verycostly, both in men and ships. It is therefore suggested that, if he assents to thewithdrawal of the troops from Thessaly, we should further demand that all except avery small body of troops should be removed from the whole of Northern Greece, andconcentrated in the Morea. When that has been done, if it can be done, his powers for evil will be in effect removed.Further intervention by the Entente Powers is obviously a difficult matter. Apartfrurn all other dangers, there is a great risk of rousing the whole of the nationalfeeling in Greece against us. It is submitted, therefore, that we ought to act as far aspossible in close co-operation with M. Venizelos. He is the only other outstanding figure in Greece besides the King. He is a man of energy and intelligence, and has the uniquedistinction amongst Balkan statesmen of being an honest man. It is therefore suggested that we should immediately enter into diplomatic relations with theProvisional Government, and to that extent, at any rate, recognise it. We should encourage M. Venizelos to appoint a diplomatic agent here, and we should formallyempower our consul-general at Salonica to deal with M. Venizelos and his Government.[1365-4] G
We should then find out from M. Venizelos as to what he thought was the best way ofdealing with the internal situation in Greece. The various courses open to us seem tobe : we might aim at (a) the dethronement of King Constantine, or (b) his deportationfor the period of the war and the appointment of a Regency, or (c) it niight even yet be possible for M. Venizelos to become the King&apos;s Prime Minister, with the powers ofa Prime Minister in a constitutional country.4. One of the great difficulties of the situation is the hot-headedness and want of judgment of the French military and naval commanders. General Sarrail hasarrogated to himself, not only the command of the troops, but also to a large extent thedirection of political affairs on behalf of the Allies. This is an exceedingly badarrangements On the other hand, it is very much to be wdshed that the political and diplomatic action should be more concentrated than it has been in the past. It istherefore submitted that we should consult our Allies immediately on this point. Weshould suggest to them that it would be of military advantage to relieve General Sarrailof all political preoccupations, and we should propose that a political officer should beappointed, who should be in close communication with General Sarrail, and withoutwhose assent no political action should be taken by either the military or naval forces.We should ask that the officer should be an Englishman ; the kind of man that is contemplated is Captain Lord Percy. He should be the representative, not of thiscountry only, but of all the Allies; and though he would ordinarily be stationed at salonica, he would, if necessary, go to Athens to advise and co-operate with the AlliedMinisters there.(Initialled)      P. C.APPENDIX III.Report of a Conference on Greek Shipping.A CONFERENCE took place at the Foreign Office this morning to consider thequestion of the treatment of Greek merchant shipping under the present circumstances.There were present: Prince Borghese.Admiral de Lostende.Mr. Spicer, Foreign Office.Mr. Hipwood, Board of Trade.Mr. Barstow, Treasury.Mr. Malkin, Foreign Office.Commander Fisher, Admiralty.Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen, Foreign Office.Mr. Nicolson, Foreign Office.Prince Borghese and Admiral de Lostende explained at the outset that they werewithout any instructions from their Governments, to whom they would have to refer.The suggestion was placed before the Conference that Greek shipownersshould be given to understand that, in the event of the present crisis resulting in hostilities, their vessels would be immune from capture so long as they were engagedin Allied trades. This proposal was found to be impracticable, owing to the impos-sibility of trusting Greek shipowners and shipmasters.As an alternative, it was proposed and subsequently agreed that measures shouldbe taken to render possible the transfer in two days of Greek vessels to the british flag. It was pointed out that, in ports abroad, rapid transfer of flag could be arrangedthrough the consul concerned. As extreme rapidity of action is necessary, it wassuggested that it would be very useful if similar steps could be taken by the Frenchand Italian Governments for equally rapid transfer. Should, however, the French andItalian Governments so prefer, it could be arranged that Greek vessels in Frenchand Italian ports might be transferred to the British flag,It was stated that it had been decided, as far as the British and French govern -ments were concerned, that Greek vessels detained at present in Allied ports shouldnot be allowed clearance unless transferred to an Allied flag, but that in cases of cargoes of extreme importance, which it was essential to allow to proceed without
delay, the vessels might be allowed clearance, provided they agreed to take on boardan armed guard if so requested by the Allied Governments.* In the cases of vessels carrying such cargoes refusing to accept an armed guard,the question of the seizure and forcible possession of the ship would be considered.Vessels proceeding directly between Allied ports without possibilitj7- of callingelsewhere en route cculd be allowred to proceed without armed guards.As regards Greek vessels already in neutral ports, it is difficult to recommend- measures for securing control, but transfers to an Allied flag could be arranged in neutral ports with equal facility.With regard to the Greek vessels on the high seas proceeding to, or likely to callat neutral ports, especially Las Pal mas, ports of north Spain, Buenos Aires, HamptonPoads, and New York, it was strongly recommended, by the Conference that measures should be taken for the diversion of these ships to an Allied port, and that the portsnamed should be carefully watched.December 11, 1916.piunteu at tue foreign office by 0. k. harrison 23/12/1916.
