The Russian Con-ference..1. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff read a telegram dated the 7th February, 1917, from General Sir Henry Wilson,reporting satisfactory progress with the Russian preparations, plans,and organisation.The Arab Revolt.2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that favourablereports had been received in regard to the Arab Revolt, includingthe blowing up, by the Shereefs own Bodyguard, of the Turkishbarracks at Bab Kubah, at Medina.Aircraft.3. The War Cabinet approved the proposal of the Chief of theImperial General Staff to send two squadrons of night aeroplanes,with their specially trained pilots, to the Western Front. Hithertothese aeroplanes had been retained in this country for defence against Zeppelins.Air Raid.Bruges.4. The First   Sea Lord reported a successful  air  raid   onLoss of the De-strqyer &quot; Ghurka.&quot;5. The First Sea Lord reported the loss of the destroyer&quot;Ghuika,&quot; which had struck a mine. Only five survivors had beenbrought in.Loss of Transports.6. The First Sea Lord reported the loss, in the same mine-field,of an empty transport, believed to be a small one. Three transportswere reported overdue at Ottawa.Submarines.; 7. The First Sea Lord reported several actions with submarines.The losses on the previous day from submarines were as follows : British ships attacked and sunk Armed ....       ... ... 5Unarmed ... ... ... 3Trawler ... ... ... british ships attacked and escaped Armed ....      ... ... 1Unarmed ... ... :.. 1Railways.Mr. Illingworth&apos;sCommittee.8. The War Cabinet approved that the War Office should havea representative on Mr. A. H. Ulingworth&apos;s interdepartmental committee on Railway Arrangements in connection with a quickerunloading of ships. .The Secretary of State for War announced that he proposed toask Mr. A. F. Pease to be the War Office representative (WarCabinet 50, Minute 10).Railways in 9. Major-General Sir Eric Geddes made a statement to the War.France. Cabinet on the subject of the unsatisfactory state of the railways inFrance, reporting that the railways were becoming exhausted in both men and material, and that even now the French Governmentwere unable to carry out their undertakings in regard to agreednew construction which was essential to the proper service of theBritish armies. This is seriously handicapping the preparations ofthe Commander-in-Chief of the British Expeditionary Force forthe campaign of 1917. The gist of the statement is contained ina memorandum (Appendix I).
The Transport of 10. With reference to the discussion on this subject on theIron Ore from previous dav (War Cabinet 5cS, Minute 3), Major-General Sir EricSpa&quot;1- Geddes said  that, as the result of the investigations into thedevelopment of railways to Taranto in connection with the transportof troops to the Balkans, he was satisfied that ho immediate reliefwould be given to shipping by the diversion of iron ore to overlandroutes, owing to the serious shortage of rolling stock on the whole ofthe French railwavs.The Shipping Con- 1L The War Cabinet had a preliminary discussion on thetroller&apos;s Powers.        question of the Shipping Controller^ powers.The question was adjourned for further evidence.Proposed Controlof parliamentary questions.12. In view of the possible serious and far-reaching conse-quences which might result from certain indiscreet parliamentary questions put to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs inconnection with the present position of the United States of America,the War Cabinet decided that It would be desirable, in principle, that the Speaker of theHouse of Commons should have a discretionary power ofcontrol over these and similar questions, and that thepublication by the press of any question before it is on theOrder Paper should be an offence.They authorised Lord Robert Cecil to approach firstMr. Asquith and then the Speaker of the House ofCommons on the subject and to report to the War Cabinet.The possible Spread 13. The War Cabinet had before them the correspondenceof Epidemics by       printed in Appendix (II) with regard to the possibility of spreadingdropping Germs       epidemics by means of germs dropped from aircraft,from the Air. .    &quot; . .In view of the opinions of the experts of the Royal Society,War Office, and Local Government Board they consideredthat no further action was required.Sir Eric Geddes stated that although British army traffic was seriously restricted there was still a considerable amount of civiliantraffic in our zone.   The War Cabinet decided that: The Foreign Office should make a strong representation to theFrench Government on the subject, pointing out that unless the French carried out their undertakings we couldnot guarantee to carry out the undertakings on which general Nivelle had laid so much stress at the london conference on the 15th-16th January, and which hadbeen strongly insisted on by M. Doumergue and AdmiralLacaze in their recent visits to London. These repre-sentations should be supported by a reasoned memorandumby the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, which might bebased partly on the statement from the Commander-in-Chief of the British Expeditionary Force called for at theprevious Meeting (War Cabinet f)7, Minute 3), and partly on information provided by Sir Eric Geddes.
National Service.Powers of director.Legislation.14. (A.) The War Cabinet approved the definition of thepowers of the Director of National Service contained in the finalparagraphs of his Second Report ( War Cabinet 55, Appendix II).(B.) Mr. Henderson having reported that he had seen and approved the draft of a Bill for establishing a Ministry of NationalService, the War Cabinet authorised him to proceed with it.(Initialled)D.

Railways in France.Memorandum by Major-General Sir Erie Geddes*THE Army Council has received a letter from the Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief British Armies in France, acquainting them of the inability of the Frenchrailways to handle the total forecast traffic for the British armies in France. Thetonnage which it was proposed to import into France for the use of the armiesamounted to, roughly, 250,000 tons per week from the month of February, and inaddition to this there would be, roughly, 100,000 tons a week locally-purchased traffic,making a total of 350,000 tons a week. It will be remembered that from the outbreakof the war the railway lines in France have been controlled and managed entirely bythe French, who have discountenanced any association of the British armies in theirmanagement. The breakdown is in the railway service, and not in any service forwhich the actual responsibility of operation rests with the British armies.Requests have been received from time to time from the French for assistance inrolling-stock, and meetings have taken place notably^from May to September lastyear between representatives of the French and British armies and War Offices, atwhich a satisfactory conclusion was believed to have been reached. Up to that timeno request for any general assistance had been put forward.During the battle of the Somme it became evident that the French railways had reached the limit of their capacity, if indeed they had not exceeded it. An investigationwas at the time being made, and estimates of the rolling-stock and locomotiverequirements and of the demands to be made on the French railways for the springoffensive of 1917 were prepared and submitted to the French.On the 11th November General Joffre asked Sir Douglas Haig for generalassistance on the railways, and this was the first indication given by the French thatthey were not completely masters of the railway situation. But there was no admissionof inability to deal with the reqtured tonnages which were before the French in full atthe time.As a result of the investigations, and in consequence of representations made bySir Douglas Haig, it was decided that considerable increase in capacity of lines and railway yards was necessary, and a programme of railway construction, which we wererespectively to undertake, was agreed upon between ourselves and the French. It wasalso agreed that we should send out large quantities of rolling-stock and locomotives,and should undertake to create repair facilities in France. As the empty waggonsupply was unsatisfactory and was not improving, and as some months would necessarily elapse before very large contributions from the British could possiblyreach France, G.Q.G. was addressed by Sir Douglas Haig on the subject of rolling-stock supply. A reply to this communication was received dated the29th December, when for the first time General Nivelle, who had just been appointedGeneral Commanding-in-Chief, stated that it was impossible to expect any substantial improvement in the state of affairs until the rolling-stock was materially increased.Sir Douglas Haig consequently saw General Nivelle, and received verbal assurances that the needs of the British armies would be met, and it was on account of these assurances that special representations&apos;were recently made to the Cabinet for priority for shipping to France. On the 23rd January, at a conference about other mattersbetween the Director-General of Transportation and the Directeur de 1&apos;Arriere atG.Q.G.,&quot;the latter stated that he could see no hope of the French being able to handlea heavier traffic than was on that date being handled until the increased capacity ofthe line and the increase in locomotive power and rolling-stock arranged at the november and December conferences had reached fruition. This intimation was immediately followed by serious restriction of traffic generally, not only in the zone ofthe British armies, but in the zone of the French armies as well. The situation atthat time was doubtless aggravated by the extreme cold, freezing of the waterways,and also by heavy coal and other special traffic. The Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief accordingly arranged a conference at G.Q.G. on the i!9th January, when the
situation was discussed as a whole. The French then expressed their ability by special efforts to handle traffic on the scale of 200,000 tons import per week, plusapproximately 100,000 tons of local traffic, and with that understanding theCommander-in-Chief in France decided that he could continue his projected plans.The French say that the breakdown is due to lack of capacity of lines, insufficiencyof rolling-stock and locomotives, and generally to the exhaustion of the Nord railway system. It is believed that the situation could be remedied by the steps which were decided upon at the November and December conferences, and the French state this to be the case. These steps were taken in hand promptly, and are being activelypursued, but they qannot possibly reach fruition for some time. The French havenow for the first time permitted professional British operating officers to collaborate with the technical officers of the Nord in order to obtain the best possible service fromthe facilities available. They have asked for British assistance to construct lines which at the November and December Conferences they undertook to build as theirproportion of the constructional programme then agreed upon, and an investigation isbeing carried out to see exactly what assistance they require to complete by a certain date. It is feared that these demands may make serious drafts upon the man-power available.Since the meeting at G.Q.G. on the 29th January, when the assurances quoted above were given by the French, a letter has been received at G-.BT.Q. stating that theincrease from (roughly) 150,000 tons a week to 200,000 tons a week import can onlybe attained gradually, and if certain constructional works are carried out for whichthe French ask British assistance. This matter is now the subject of correspondence between Sir Douglas Ffaig and General Nivelle, as it is a departure from the under-standing arrived at on the 29th January at the G.Q.G. Conference. Until the positionthus arising has been cleared up the situation must be a somewhat uncertain one.It is believed that if the French can fulfil their undertaking of the 29th january the operations as forecast can take place, but if they are unable to do so modificationof or postponement of the plans may be a necessary result.February 8, 1917.APPENDIX II.Dropping op Germs from the Air.(Report from the Chairman of Local Government Board.)Dear Colonel Swinton, January 29, 1917.I ENCLOSE a note by Dr. A. Newsholme, C.B., Medical Officer of the LocalGovernment Board, on the question raised in your letter of the 26th instant. As youwill observe, my Department has been for a long while alive to the possibility ofattempts being made to introduce disease into this country, but so far, I am glad to say, no evidence has reached us of any attempts having been made. I do not know whether Sir Arthur Davidson has anything beyond surmise to support hissuspicion that such attempts may now be made by aircraft.I have not asked Dr. Newsholme to offer any suggestions as to the method inwhich we could effect reprisals of a similar nature if attempts of the kind were made.Yours very faithfully,(Signed) RHONDDA.Memorandum on Use of Bombs or Vessels containing Poisonous Germsby the Enemy.1. The risk of aerial dissemination of disease germs from aeroplanes or Zeppelinshas been previously considered by the Local Government Board. I advised in J une1915 that-&quot;aerial dissemination of disease may be dismissed as very unlikely to be&quot; successful if attempted.&quot;
Dropping of Germs from the Air.(Report from the Director-General, Army Medical Service.)Dear Colonel Swinton, January 31, 1917.I got my experts together to discuss the question of poisonous germs being dropped from air-ships, &amp;c, to our disadvantage, as also the question of preparing forreprisals.   I enclose a copy of the Statement they have made on the subject.Yours sincerely,(Signed)      ALFRED KEOGEL[1369-59]D, 2. So far as I can ascertain there have been only two allegations of attempts in thisdirection. The first was published in the &quot;Daily Chronicle&quot; and &quot;Times&quot; of the13th October, 1916, poisoned sweets and garlic saturated with cholera bacilli beingstated to have been dropped at Constanza from enemy aeroplanes.No confirmation of this statement has been received by the Board, and there is no evidence that cholera was caused by this agency.3. It was stated in a letter to the Board that, according to information &quot; from areliable source,&quot; infected sweetmeats had been dropped over Sheffield. On enquiry,no confirmation of this statement could be obtained.4. I suggest the desirability of enquiries from Colonel Sir Arthur Davidson what are the facts and inferences which have led him 4o the conclusion that the dropping of&quot;poisoned germs in bombs or vessels &quot; is under contemplation, or is likely. I shall beglad to consider carefully any evidence on this point which may be forthcoming.5. On the evidence so far available, I submit the following statements : (a.) Spread of disease by means of disease germs dropped from aeroplanes is highly improbable. The production of human infection, when possible by such means, would necessarily be partial and casual, and could therefore bebrought promptly within control, before it assumed epidemic proportions.(b.) A possible exception to this statement is constituted by infection of publicwater supplies by the germs of cholera or typhoid fever. If infection ofwater supplies were contemplated, means other than projection of infectiousmaterial from aeroplanes would almost certainly be attempted by enemiesin this country. The Board have gone thoroughly into this subject in its practical aspects.Infection of water supplies from the air may be. dismissed as extremelyimprobable ; and if it occurred, the routine precautions taken by responsiblewater authorities to protect water consumers would, as a rule, suffice toprevent serious spread of disease,(c.) It is scarcely necessary to discuss separately the risk of spread of disease suchas smallpox, plagne, or anthrax, or foot and mouth disease in cattle, byaerial infection from aeroplanes.There is a possibility of casual and localised infection, so far at least as smallpox is concerned ; and possibly also of foot and mouth disease.Smallpox can be controlled at each place of origin, given prompt action ;aud its origin in the way contemplated must be regarded as a remotecontingency.(d.) Against the improbable dangers under consideration, I have not suggestedprecautionary measures beyond those already adopted. Under war conditions a remote danger must remain, which can only be met as itarises.A. NEWSHOLME.January 27, .19 L 7.
D.G., A.M.S.,The enclosed letter (from Sir Arthur Davidson to Lord Hardinge of Penshurst)was considered at a Meeting of the Army Sanitary Committee this morning, when theCommittee were assisted in their deliberations by :  Major C. Andrewes, F.R.S. ;Dr. Morley Fletcher, F.R.S. ;Lieut.-ColoneI D. Harvey, R.A.M.C.;Lieut.-Colonel Sir Ronald Ross, K.C.B., F.R.S. ;Dr. Graham Smith, F.R.S. ; andLieut.-Colonel A. L. A. Webb, R.A.M.C.The Meeting was of opinion that the danger of the introduction of disease in anyproportion (which could not be readily dealt with under existing facilities), by meansof germs dropped from aircraft, is so remote as to make it undesirable at this stage to divert tbe services of scientific men, which are fully occupied in other directions, tothe previous preparation of possible retaliative measures. These it is thought wouldprobably be readily improvisable at short notice should the necessity arise.At the same time the Committee does not in any way wish to discourage theconsideration of possibilities in the way of retaliatory measures, though it does not recommend that any considerable expenditure be at present incurred.(Signed)      E. GANN,Secretary, Army Sanitary Committee.January 81, 1917.Use of Bombs containing Poisonous Germs by Enemy and proposed Formsof Retaliation.(Copy of Letter from Colonel Sir Arthur Davidson to Lord Hardinge of Penshurst.)My dear Hardinge, January 18, 1917.I know you will not mind my writing to you on this question, and there is no need to answer this letter I know how very busy you are.From various things I have heard, or conclusions I have come to, I am pretty sure that the Germans, in their forthcoming &quot; campaign of fright-fulness&quot; they intendagainst us, and which may begin now at any moment, are going to employ poisongerms in the bombs or vessels they drop over here from their Halberstadt aeroplanesby day or from their Zeppelins by night.Should this be carried out, there is only one thing to do, and that is to adoptinstant reprisals and retaliation by bombing every important German open town wecan get at.Of course warn the German Government beforehand, but lose not one moment in adopting the retaliation after the first poison germs have been dropped here.It is the only form of action the Germans understand or respect, or that influencesthem, but in order to carry it out all details must be decided beforehand. If thereis any delay the question is discussed in the newspapers, every sort of religious,humanitarian, or future peace crank airs his views, and in the end we submit, as wehave to the bombing of our open towns, to an outrage at the bidding of those whc arenot soldiers.Do get this question debated and settled by the War Cabinet beforehand, so thatwhen the moment comes we may not be caught unprepared, but may be able to actat once.Yours, &amp;c.(Signed) ARTHUR DAVIDSON.Dropping of Germs from the Air.(Report from the Royal Society&apos;s War Committee.)Sir, Burlington House, Piccadilly, W., February 1, 1917.Your letter (31/B/l) of the 25th January, with enclosure from Sir Arthur Davidson,relating to the contingency of the distribution of poison germs by aircraft, has been
referred to two of the Society&apos;s War Committees jointly, and their resolution on thesubject is as follows : &quot;The Committee do not consider that the risk of any extensive outbreak of disease in this country could arise from the scattering of disease germs fromhostile aircraft. Should local outbreaks of infection be thus produced, they could probably be dealt with by ordinary administrative means. It is not at presentworth while to take scientific men from other and more important duties to devisemethods of retaliation. A number of such means could be improvised bybiological preparation in two or three weeks, if it should become necessary.&quot; The engineering problems connected with methods of distribution, in theevent of retaliation appearing necessary or desirable, would probably involveabout two months&apos; work.&quot;Notwithstanding the enclosed resolution, the questions raised will not be lostsight of by the Royal Society. Any important conclusion which may be reached after further consideration of every possibility will be communicated without delay.We are, Sir,Faithfully yours,(Signed) A. SCHUSTER,W. B. HARDY,Secretaries of theRoyal Society.The Secretary,Committee of Imperial Defence,2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.ao
