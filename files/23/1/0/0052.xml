Row, R.N., Assistant Secretary.Captain Clement Jones, Assistant Secretary.Russia: Railways. 1. THE Secretary reported that Mr. Bury, of the CanadianPacific Railway, the expert to be attached to Lord Milner&apos;commission in Russia, had arrived in this country; that the PrimeMinister had given him his instructions; that Mr. Bury hoped to start at once, and that the Foreign Office had been asked to telegraph to Lord Milner accordingly (War Cabinet 47, Minute 29;War Cabinet 38, Minute 1).
Sinking of a 2. The First Sea Lord reported that the total loss involved inBritish Submarine, the sinking of Submarine K. 13 was two officers and twenty-threemen. He stated that it was probable that the cause of the loss ofthe vessel vrould not he known until she was raised.Hospital Ships.3. The First Sea Lord reported that the alternative courses inregard to hospital ships in connection with the German pro-clamation were as follows : (a.) To sail them as far as possible through the safe area, which meant increased journey;(6.) To continue them on their present routes brilliantly lit;(c.) To send them along present routes darkened.The War Cabinet considered that the question was closelyallied to that of reprisals (War Cabinet 50, Minute 5). In themeantime, it was decided that: Hospital ships should sail without lights, this being the courseinvolving the least risks.Air Board.4. The War Cabinet approved the Memorandum by the AirBoard (Appendix I), drawn up in accordance with the decision ofthe War Cabinet on the 22nd December, 1916 (War Cabinet 15,Minute 9). The War Cabinet were doubtful if any advantage would be derived from immediate publication. They thought itwould be preferable to make a statement in Parliament shouldthe occasion arise.Blockade of the :* 5. The War Cabinet considered the questions which arise outUnited Kingdom,     Gf the German declaration of blockade, with special reference toFrance, and Italy,    the provisional detention of neutral ships  in our  ports (WarCabinet 51, Minute 4).   The number of neutral ships detained in, ports in the United Kingdom is approximately 360, mostly with aprobable freightage of 2,000 to 3,000 gross tons.   It was also statedthat there were about 140 neutral ships in Allied ports.   The repre-sentatives of the Board, of Trade stated that, if these ships weredetained, they were of opinion that, with the Admiralty&apos;s assistance,it might be possible for us to man them.The War Cabinet decided that : (a.) The Admiralty should arrange for the Collectors of Customsto release at once by name the few American, Spanish,and South American ships in our ports, as well as theSwedish ship on which the Swedish Delegates had arranged to return.(6.) That the Foreign Office should send a telegram to Norway,Sweden, Denmark, and Holland, in the sense that, inconsequence of the German proclamation of blockadeit would clearly he difficult for these countries toobtain adequate supplies of sea-borne commodities, andthat he hoped that no Governmental action would be taken  which might hamper any arrangement which theBritish Government might make with shipowners.(c.) That the Foreign Office should repeat these telegrams tothe Governments of France, Ttussia, Italy, Portugal,and Japan, informing them fully of our proposals, andrequesting them also to detain Norwegian, Swedish,Danish, and Dutch ships.
(d.) That Lord Robert Cecils Interdepartmental Committee on shipping Questions should take steps to approach theowners of ships under the flags of Norway, Sweden, and denmark, with a view to arranging time-charters, ifpossible, following which they should report as to requi-sitioning.(e.) That the report on the subject by the Head of the AdmiraltyTrade Division should he circulated immediately, andshould be brought up for discussion to-morrow,Saturday, the 3rd February, together with the question as to what action should be taken as regards neutralmerchant ships in Indian, Dominion, and Colonialwaters.(/.) That no further action should be taken with respect to theDominions, Colonies, and India, pending a reply to the telegram asking for information regarding the numberof neutral ships in their harbours (War Cabinet 51,Minute 4 (iii and iv).)Swedish 6. The War Cabinet authorised the Minister of Blockade to agreement. sign the agreement with the Swedish delegates, which is based onthe following principles : (a.) To provide security for the maintenance of transit arrange-ments to Russia,(b.) To secure an agreement in regard to the rationing of sweden in respect to important articles.They take note that the Swedish delegates have made stipula-tions in regard to this agreement, which are embodied, not in theagreement itself, but in a draft confidential letter from the Ministerof Blockade to the delegates. On the advice of the Minister of blockade, the War Cabinet sanctioned this arrangement, subject tominor alterations, which have been embodied in the letter asprinted in Appendix II.Food Supplies: 7. The War Cabinet discussed a telegram from the BritishStatement in the Ambassador at Washington to the effect that the German EmbassyUnited States of have declared that Great Britain has food for only thirty davsAmerica. (Appendix III).The Minister of Blockade asked for the instructions of theWar Cabinet as to whether he should take the opportunity of seeing a representative of the American press in order to contradictthe statement made by the German Embassy. The War cabinet decided that: Having regard to the importance of inducing the people of thiscountry to economise in food to the utmost extent, itwould be better not to divulge the true and more satis-f satisfactory position of food supplies in the United Kingdom,but that a telegram should be sent to Sir C. Spring-Ricegiving him. the facts for his own information.Eussian 8. The War Cabinet had before them a paper (Appendix IV)Reservation to on this subject.   They decided that: the Resolutions of Ti         .            ,                 J       ,    . .          ...    ,,     ,.        .the Paris If was impossible to come to a decision until alter the PrimeEconomic Ministers return.   In the meantime, however, the war conference. Cabinet  were  of  opinion  that, while  His   Majesty&apos;s
Government could not agree themselves to sign the SecretDeclaration proposed by the Russian Government, thelatter might be left to sign it on tbeir own behalf.Lord Robert Cecil undertook to ascertain the viewsof the French Government in regard to the matter.Restriction ofSupplies ofMaterial to theAlliedGovernments.9. The &quot;War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumby the Minister of Munitions on this subject (Appendix V).Sir E. Wyldbore Smith, the Chairman of the Commissioninternationale de Ravitaillement, was authorised to communicate to the delegates of the Allied Governments on the Commission astatement of the restrictions in force in the United Kingdom, andto take such steps as were necessary for setting up Committees tomake priority recommendations in regard to their demands for thevarious materials. The Minister of Munitions stated that similarCommittees already existed in regard to the Dominions.(Initialled) A. B. L.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,February 2, 1917.
Lettrr from the Secretary of the Air Board.A.B. 81/11.Sir, Air Board Office, Strand, W.O., February 1, 1917.I AM directed by the President of the Air Board to refer to Sections 7 and 8 ofthe New Ministries and Secretaries Act, 1916, and to the proceedings of the WarCabinet of the 22nd December, 1916,*&apos; when the Cabinet determined in outline theduties and functions of the Air Board and its relations with the Admiralty, WarOffice, and Ministry of Munitions. The Cabinet decided that the details of the new arrangement should he worked out in consultation between these Departments.1 am now to forward, for the approval of the War Cabinet, a Memorandumembodying the conclusions which have been arrived at by the four Departments as aresult of discussion of the subject.It will be observed that the Memorandum embodies the material portions of theresolution of the War Committee of tbe 11th May, 1916, and of the draft conclusionsof the War Committee of the 27th November, which were approved by the WarCabinet on the 22nd December, 1916, with two substantial alterations, apart from some slight modifications of wording.   The two alterations arc the following: In the first place, the decision of tbe Cabinet to entrust the design as well as thesupply of aircraft to the Ministry of Munitions was found to give rhe to certain difficulties. That Department, constituted primarily as a manufacturing or supply department, did not consider itself well adapted to dealing with the highly specialisedduty of selecting and approving the designs of aircraft. The science of aeronautics isat present in a state of such rapid and constant growth that it appeared expedient that its application to questions of design should be in the hands of a body on whichthe Naval and Military Flying Services were directly represented, and an agreement was arrived at accordingly that the Air Board should be charged with this duty. the accommodation in close proximity under one roof in the new premises of the Air Boardof the Departments dealing with Design and Supply respectively will secure theircomplete co-ordination.In the second place, it was agreed by all concerned that better results would beobtained if the distinction made in the records of the proceedings of the WTar cabinet of the 22nd December, 1916, between the treatment of aeroplanes and seaplanes, bywhich the former were to be designed and supplied by the Ministry of Munitions andtbe latter by the Admiralty, were not insisted upon. Aeroplanes and seaplanes aremanufactured by the same firms, are built out of the same raw materials, and presentin points ot design, in a large measure, the same problems. In these circumstances itis proposed that the design and supply of seaplanes should be dealt with in the same manner as the design and supply of aeroplanes.I am to express the hope that the War Cabinet may see fit to approve theMemorandum, which has been drawn up on this basis.It will be seen that the Memorandum restricts the province of the Air Board to questions of naval and military aeronautics. The conclusion of peace will bringwith it urgent problems of another order.The rapid development of aeronautics during the war will give an immediateimpetus to commercial aviation, the development and regulation of which both froma domestic, an Imperial, and an international standpoint, will present problems whichwill need consideration by a body familiar with the technical conditions which thoseproblems involve.Apart from this, the disposal of large quantities of costly aeronautical material,which may be surplus to peace requirements and will deteriorate rapidly, will have tobo considered. The needs of the Dominions and the requirements of commercialaviation may present the means of disposing in part of this material.The Air Board is of opinion that it would be in the public interest that it shouldbe given power to consider and discuss these questions in good time with departmentaland other assistance as may prove necessary. Their consideration should not be unduly hurried, while the correspondence involved, e.g., with the Dominions, mayoccupy a considerable period.* Note by the Secretary to the War Cabinet. See War Cabinet 15, Minute 9.[1365-52] C
I am accordingly to suggest that the Cabinet should add a paragraph to the enclosed Memorandum to the iollowing effect : &quot; The Air Board will have power to consider the problems connected withthe development and regulation of aviation for civil and commercial purposes andto make recommendations to the Departments concerned.&quot;I am further to suggest that, in view of the public interest taken in the new arrangements to be adopted in connection with the Air Services, it would be desirablethat the enclosed Memorandum, if approved by the Cabinet, should be published, andI am to ask the authority of the Cabinet for doing so.I am, &amp;c.H. P. HARVEY.The Secretary,War Cabinet,10, Downing Street, S.W.Enclosure to Appendix I.Memorandum by the Air Board.1. The Board Avill be composed of The President,The Parliamentary Secretary,The Fifth Sea Lord of the Admiralty,The Director-General of Military Aeronautics,Two Representatives of the Ministry of Munitions,Additional Members, as may from time, to time be found desirable.The naval and military representatives shall each be authorised to bring tomeetings of -the Board an assistant if and when they think fit. in case of the absenceof the Fifth Sea Lord or the Director-General of Military Aeronautics, an officer willhe deputed to represent the Admiralty or War Office.2. The Board shall be free to discuss matters of policy in relation to the air, andto make reeomrnedations to the Admiralty and War Office thereon.3. The Admiralty and War Office will concert their respective aerial policies inconsultation with the Air Board.4t. The Admiralty and War Office will formulate the programmes of aerialproduction required for the fulfilment of the approved policy, and will refer these programmes for the consideration and concurrence of the Air Board.5. The Air Board will decide as to the extent to which it is possible to approve the departmental programmes, having regard to the possible rate of production, theneeds of the other Department, the respective urgency of the demands, and the suppliesagreed to be given to Allied Governments.6. The Air Board will select and be responsible for the designs of aeroplanes andseaplanes, with their engines and accessories, which are to be constructed for thepurposes of the approved programme and for experimental purposes.7. For the purpose of carrying out its duties in connection with design a technical Committee will be constituted under the Air Board as follows: Chairman, to be appointed by the President of the Air Board.Two representatives appointed by the Admiralty.Two representatives appointed by the War Office, iTwo representatives appointed by the Ministry of Munitions.Three other members possessed of special qualifications may be appointed by thePresident; at least one of them shall have present day manufacturing experience.The officers selected to represent the above Departments of the Government maybe assisted&apos; or replaced by other representatives as may be found convenient.The representatives of either of the three Departments may appeal to the AirBoard in the event of their disagreeing with a decision of the majority of theCommittee.
APPENDIX II.Proposed Secret Letter.(Secret.)Gentlemen, Foreign Office, January    , 1917.WITH reference to the draft Agreement between His Britannic Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the Royal Swedish Government, which is the result of discussion between the British and Swedish delegates, I am able to state that, in the event of thedraft Agreement being ratified, notwithstanding the terms of the guarantees in thesecond schedule to the Agreement, His Brittanic Majesty&apos;s Government will not object to the export from Sweden of articles containing small quantities of tin, rubber,copper, brass, aluminium, ferro-manganese, or rosin, provided that (a.) Such raw materials shall not in any case exceed 7-g- per cent, of the total value of the manufactured article ; and(6.) The export shall not be allowed in the case of any article which is now or may hereafter be placed on the British list of either absolute or conditionalcontraband, or in the case of any article which is commercially capable byany process of being reduced to its original constituents; and[1365-52] . D8. One of the members of the Technical Committee will be the ExecutiveDirector of the Technical Department of the Air Board.9. An Inventions Committee will be appointed by the President of the Air Board,in which will be amalgamated the functions of the Aeronautical Sections of the NavalBoard of Invention and Research &quot;and of the Munitions Inventions Department.10. Experiments for the Naval and Military Air Services will be conducted for those Services through the Technical Committee. For this purpose, Naval andMilitary Air Service experimental stations will, while remaining under the admiralty and War Office for administration, pay, and discipline, be placed at the disposal of theTechnical Committee, which will issue its instructions through the Service membersof the Air Board. The experimental stations in question are the following (to beagreed upon from time to time).11. The Royal Aircraft Factory will lie placed under the Ministry of Munitions,and the designs prepared at the Factory will be dealt with in the same way as thosesubmitted by a contractor. It is understood that the Ministry of Munitions will permit the facilities of the Factory to be utilised largely for the purpose of conducting the experiments which are desired by the Technical Committee.12. The Air Board will furnish approved plans and specifications to the AircraftSupply Department of the Ministry of Munitions.13. No modifications of design, other than trivial alterations within the discretion of a superintending inspector, will be made without the concurrence of the AirBoard.14. The numbers and designs of the aeroplanes, seaplanes, engines, and accessoriesrespectively to be ordered, having been determined by the Air Board, wili be notified to the Director of Munitions Requirements and Statistics through the Controller ofAeronautical Supplies of the Ministry of Munitions, who will be responsible for their production, in conformity with the approved designs, and who alone is authorised togive instructions to manufacturers.15. Inspection during manufacture will be carried out by the Ministry ofMunitions.16. All reasonable facilities will be afforded to expert officers of the Air Boardand of the Services to have access to manufacturers&apos; works.1*7. The Ministry of Munitions will hand over to the Air Service for which theyare destined, for trial and acceptance, the aeroplanes, seaplanes, engines, and accessories, when manufactured, at the manufacturers&apos; works.18. For the purpose of giving etfect to the above organisation, the officers and staff at present engaged under the Admiralty and the War Office on the duties of design and supply of aeroplanes, seaplanes, engines, and accessories and on the Boardof Invention and Research will, so far as may be required and possible, be lentfor services with the Air Board or the Ministry of Munitions.19. Any of the Departments represented on the Air Board, and the Air Boarditself, will have the right of appeal to the War Cabinet in case of dispute.
(c.) The amount so exported in any quarterly period shall not exceed the averagenormal trade prevailing before the war; and(d.) His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government will be furnished, at as early a date, aspossible before the ratification of the Agreement, with a list of the articlesabove referred to.2. His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government will also not object to the export of imported tin, nickel, aluminium, and rubber in compensation for a correspondingquantity of the same raw materials contained in au article imported from a belligerentcountry to Sweden in&apos;cases where such compensation has been made an absolutecondition for the export of the article to Sweden, provided that the amount so exportedin any quarterly period shall not exceed 10^- tons of tin, 2-^ tons of nickel,   ton of aluminium, and 1^ tons of rubber.3. It is expressly understood that no exportation under the tei-ms of this letterwill be allowed to take place except under certificate from the Swedish Handelskom-mission to the effect that they have satisfied themselves that the several conditionshereby laid down have been exactly fulfilled.4. As I have already informed you, His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government regard this modification of the operation of the guarantees as open to strong objection, andthey feel that it would be greatly to the common advantage if they can be assured that there will he full and frank discussion of any question that may arise with regardto the working of the above-mentioned arrangements.Swedish Delegates.APPENDIX III.Sir G. Spring-Rice to Lord Robert Cecil. (Received February 2, 1G&quot;40 a.m.)(Telegraphic.)   R. Washington, February   , 1917.GERMAN Embassy state that (ireat Britain has food for thirty days only.Associated Press suggest that &quot;it might hewed if you could take an early opportunityof contradicting this statement. If allowed to stand, many Americans who wantpeace at any price will remain silent, whereas they may join those in favour of active measures on the part of the United States Government if they know we have pientvof food.&quot;APPENDIX IV.THE Russian Government have signified to His Majesty&apos;s Government and to theFrench Government that they can only consent to ratify the resolutions of theEconomic Conference held in Paris in June last if it is agreed to sign at the same time a secret declaration to the following effect: &quot; The undersigned delegates of France, Great Britain, and Russia, being duly authorised to do so, have agreed that, in the elaboration of the measures necessary forthe execution of the resolutions adopted by the Economic Conference of the Allies heldat Paris in June 1916, each of the three Governments will take into account the specialeconomic conditions of its country, and the exceptional position which it accords tocertain categories of enemy subjects. It is fully understood that this declaration mustbe considered as forming an integral part of the instrument signed by the delegates,and that it will consequently be recognised as being ratified by any instrument ratifying the resolutions adopted by the aforesaid Conference.&quot; The present declaration will not be published.&quot; Done at Paris,&quot; &amp;c..2. On being asked by His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Petrograd to explain more precisely the scope of the proposed Secret Declaration, the Russian Government statedthat it meant that they associated themselves generally with the decisions of theEconomic Conference, but reserved to themselves the right not to carry them into effect in cases where their application would be directly detrimental to Russian interests.
APPEND [X V.Memorandum by the Minister of Munitions, circulated for Consideration bythe War Cabinet at an Early Date.Suggested Restrictions on Supplies of Material to the Allied Governments.(Secret.)MY attention his been drawn to tin anomalies of the existing situation withregard to the supplies of certain essential war materials to the Allied Governments ascompared with the position in this country or in the Dominions and Colonies. as any pi-proposal to alter the position raises diplomatic and financial questions outside thescope of the Ministry of Munitions, I desire to submit the matter to the War cabinet for consideration.2. The position in this country as regards a few of the supplies which I have inmind mav he verv briefly indicated as follows : (1.) Tin Plate.No permits are issued for the use of tin plate for food packing orother commercial purposes in the United Kingdom. The result has been to shut down the greater part of the export trade in foodstuffs and semi-fluid commodities.(2.) Steel for Building.No building work costing more than 500L can be carried out in theUnited Kingdom except under licence, and no steel of the best qualities is permitted to be supplied for building purposes. Further, no permits are issued for corrugated sheeting, and the result is that buildings required for urgent war work are being constructed of brick, wood, and slate, or, wheresteelwork is essential, of steel of inferior qualities.(3.) Copper and Brass.The use of copper, brass, and copper alloys, whether for Governmentpurposes or for private trade is rigidly restricted, and accurate returns arerequired of all brass and copper scrap which is produced by GovernmentDepartments or other consumers to whom permits for supplies of the metalshave been granted.3. In face of this situation at home, applications are constantly being received through the International Supplies Commission by the Priority Branch of the ministry for the supply to the Allied Governments of the materials mentioned above, and of others whose use at home is not less strictly limited, for purposes which, under the classification in force in this country, cannot possibly be regarded as war demands, andwould not therefore be considered to justify similar applications at home.4. I therefore suggest that steps should be taken, either through the diplomaticchannel or through the International Supplies Commission, to bring the followingpoints to the notice of the Allied Governments, with an emphatic statement of the vital importance of restricting the demands put forward : * 3. It is obvious that this declaration enables any of the three Governments to disregard the Paris resolutions, either in part or altogether, if it chooses, but it ispractically certain that the Russian Government will not ratify the resolutions without this reserve.   The French Government are ready to sign the declaration.4. A Cabinet decision is required as to whether His Majesty&apos;s Government should express their readiness to sign the Declaration, and as to whether the other AlliedGovernments, notably the Japanese and Italian Governments, should also be invited todo so.   The Russian Government are pressing for an early reply.Foreign Office, January 1, 1917.
(a.) It is unreasonable to expect that tbe ordinary industries of Allied countries-can continue to have a guarantee of a fixed proportion of the materials which they require, while similar industries in Great Britain are not givensimilar supplies, and have either to close down or go to the expense andtrouble of finding substitutes. It must be remembered that the deficienciesarising in the materials in question, as regards the Allied requirements forwar purposes, have to be made good from the supplies in this country.(6.) The use of steel of the best quality for constructional purposes should besubject to limitations similar to those in force in this country, and ShellDiscard quality steel should be used instead of mild steel, wherever steel ofany kind is thought to be necessary.(c.) I suggest that, if possible, the restriction of the use of copper and brass inordinary industry should be on the same lines as are adopted here. Aspecial emphasis should be laid upon the need for economy in the use ofthese materials in the construction of ships of war and merchant shipping.(d.) The attention of the Allied Governments might be drawn to the fact that theColonies have already agreed to prohibit the importation of certainmaterials, not required directly for war purposes, of which supplies cannotbe obtained from Great Britain.(e.) The Allied Governments should be required, as a condition of receiving anyfurther supplies of tin plate, to furnish the Government with as full astatement as possible of tbeir requirements for the next six months, and ofthe purposes which it is proposed to apply any quantities of tin plateallocated to them. It should be pointed out that arrangements of this kindhave already been made as regards the Colonies, and that it should not beexpected that supplies will be forthcoming for any purpose not directlyconnected with the prosecution of the war.5. Subject to the general concurrence of the War Cabinet in the policy indicated above, I would suggest that the substance of this Memorandum be submitted forobservations to the Government Departments concerned, with a view to the adoption ofthe proposals and the preparation of the necessary communications for transmission tothe Allied Governments, through whatever channel is considered most expedient.C. A.Ministry of Munitions,January 27, 1917.o
