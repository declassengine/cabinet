The Chief  of  the Imperial General Staff  reported   the capture of occupation of Gommecourt by the British forces.Gommecourt.
Mesopotamia. 4. The Chief of tbe Imperial General Staff read a telegramfrom Mesopotamia indicating that the Turkish Army was not onlyin full retreat, but had suffered heavy losses, including a numberof guns and howitzers, which had been thrown into the Tigris, andthat the total number of prisoners since the commencement of thepresent operations in December was 5,300. He stated that theBritish advanced troops in pursuit were now 30 miles west of Kut.The First Sea Lord reported that in proceeding to Kut-el-Amara the Tigris steamers had sustained a few hits, but there had only been one casualty.Instructions toGeneral Maude.5. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff asked for theinstructions of the War Cabinet as to the further orders to be givento the Commander-in-Chief of the Mesopotamia Expeditionary Force.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff pointed out to the WarCabinet that General Maude&apos;s present instructions (War Committee,71, Appendix), which were approved by the War Committee on the28th September, 1916, precluded him from an advance to Baghdad(Appendix I). The Chief of the Imperial General Staff asked for instructions vide General Maude&apos;s telegram No. 878 (Appendix II) &apos;and mentioned the following factors as affecting the question of amore forward advance being made : (a.) The difficulty of maintaining the force.(b.) Baghdad is a difficult place to hold.(c.) The questions of Turkish reinforcements and the action ofthe Russian forces both of which are at presentdoubtful.(d.) The Government would no doubt like our troops to be at baghdad before the Russians,(e.) The possibility of continuing to find the necessary shipping.He said that General Maude&apos;s communications would probably not be adequate to maintain permanently a sufficient - force at Baghdadbefore the 1st April, but he could, no doubt, continue to push furtherforward than at present, and he might be able to raid Baghdad, butthe Chief of the Imperial General Staff could not say whether andwhen Baghdad itself cotdd be occupied and safely and effectivelyheld.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that he under-stood the policy of the British Government to be that, subject tothe security of the force and the capacity of the communications, itwas desired to establish British influence in tba Baghdad vilayet.The War Cabinet informed the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff that he had correctly understood their policy, and directedhim to convey instructions in that sense to General Maude, on theunderstanding that, without departing therefrom, the latter was to exploit the recent operations to the fullest possible extent.Transports Ashore.6. The First Sea Lord reported that three transports and a destroyer had gone ashore near Havre owing to fog. Efforts werebeing made to get them off, and steps had been taken to protect them from submarine attack.Transports to 7. The First Sea Lord reported that the transport of additionalFrance. &apos; Divisions to France could not be completed before the full moon.Unless this transport was very urgent, he strongly recommended itssuspension for three days on each side of the full moon.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff undertook to considerthe question and to inform the First Sea Lord, the matterbeing brought before the Cabinet to-morrow, if necessary.
Submarines.8. The First Sea Lord reported a number of encounters withsubmarines, in one of which he considered the enemy submarine hadbeen sunk.Mr. Edison&apos;sInventions.9. The First Sea Lord reported that he had made enquiries asto the story that Mr. Edison was dissatisfied with his treatment bythe Admiralty in regard to a certain invention, said to relate to the location of submarines. He had ascertained that the invention wasonly a form of electrical storage battery for use in submarines.These articles were now under trial in the British Navy, and wouldbe reported on in three months&apos; time. There had been considerable delay on the part of Mr. Edison in supplying these articles for trial. The results of the First Sea Lord&apos;s enquiries up to date,made at the War Oabinet&apos;s request (War Cabinet, 78, Minute 2) asto submarine detectors, were that the Government of the UnitedStates of America had no anti-submarine device of this nature. he added that further enquiries were being made by the Admiralty.Restriction of 10. With  reference  to  the  representation  of   the  FrenchImports: Government on the subject of the restriction of imports, the prime the French Minister stated that he discussed the  question yesterday  withAttitude. M. Briand  at Calais.   M. Briand had made  no demur to hisexplanations of the motives of the British Government in adoptingthis policy, and had undertaken to explain them to the french minister of Commerce.The War Cabinet authorised the Secretary of State for Foreign-   Affairs to inform the French Ambassador in this sense.Tariff Treaty with japan.11. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed theWar Cabinet that some years ago a treaty had been made betweenGreat Britain and Japan with regard to no preferential tariffs being-imposed against certain staple industries of Japan, and that theJapanese Ambassador had drawn his attention to this treaty. Toconsider this and similar cases prior to rendering a report to theCabinet, Mr. Balfour asked that a small Committee, composed of thePresident of the Board of Trade and himself and representatives oftheir Departments, might be authorised.The War Cabinet approved this proposal.Anglo-french conference, 26thand 27th February,1917:Responsibility ofthe British andFrench Com-manders-in-Chief.12. The Prime Minister described in detail the discussions at,and the negotiations in connection with, the Anglo-french conference at Calais on the 26th and 27th February.The War Cabinet confirmed the signed agreement, approving the plans of the two Commanders-in-Chief, and regulating theirrespective limits of responsibility during the forthcoming operations on the Western Front (Appendix III).13. The War Cabinet decided that The Secretary of State for War should inform Field-Marshal sir douglas Haig that the arrangement made at the CalaisConference of the 27th instant regarding the relations to exist between him and General Nivelle during the forth-coming operations had for its object merely the securing ofa clearly defined unity of control, and one which the FrenchGovernment understood and definitely accepted. It was inno sense an aspersion on the ability and qualifications of
Sir Douglas Haig, in whom the War Cabinet continue to entertain full confidence.Liaison Arrange-ments on theWestern Front.14. The War Cabinet also approved the arrangement enteredinto by the Prime Minister at the Calais Conference for the appoint-ment of a General Officer of some standing as Head of the british mission at French General Headquarters, as well as a representativeof the Quarter-Master General to the British ExpeditionaryForce.They requested the Chief of the Imperial General Staff toreport the action taken in this connection.salonica:The Role of theAllied Armies.15. The War Cabinet approved the following decision arrivedat by the Calais Conference, defining the scope of the Allied Armiesbased on Salonica : As the co-operation of the Russo-Roumanian forces againstBulgaria is not yet possible, the Conference agrees to confirm the decision of the Rome Conference, and decidesthat, for the present, the decisive defeat of the BulgarianArmy is not a practical objective, and that the mission ofthe Allied forces at Salonica is to keep on their front theenemy forces now there, and to take advantage of strikingthe enemy if opportunity offers.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary ofState for War were requested to communicate this decision as requisite.Publication of IrishCourts-Martial.16. The War Cabinet decided that It was contrary to the public interest that the present Govern-ment should confirm the statement by the late PrimeMinister that the proceedings of the Irish Courts-Martialwould be published. Among the reasons leading them tothis decision were the present inflammable condition ofIreland ; the fact that the witnesses before the Courts-Martial were aware that the proceedings were secret and gave evidence on that distinct understanding ; and that ifthe proceedings were published it was anticipated thatthere would certainly be great difficulty in obtainingevidence in the future if further trouble arose.Man-Power:Issue of OrderrequiringEmployers to keepRegisters.17. The War Cabinet approved the proposed amendment of theDefence of the Realm Regulation 41 (a) (War Cabinet, 78, Minute8 (b)), subject to the omission of paragraph 1, which would have extended the application of the Order to Ireland.The dardanelles commission.18. The Secretary reported that the alterations to the Report ofthe Dardanelles Commission which the Admiralty and War Officeconsidered must, in the public interest, be made before publication,had been received, and he was in touch with the Commission on thesubject. He had. however, not yet received the observations of theForeign Office, who, he understood, were awaiting; a reply from theFrench Government.   The&apos;War Cabinet decided that The Foreign Office should make a representation to the FrenchGovernment that, unless an immediate communication to
19. The Minister of Blockade reported to the War Cabinet the&apos;steps that had been taken to induce ships belonging to the Scandinavian-scandinavian countries to resume their trade with the United Kingdomand elsewhere.   He pointed out that (a.) As far as Norwegian shipping was concerned, the progress had been satisfactory, but that no Swedish, Danish, orDutch ships had resumed their sailings.(6.) With regard to Denmark, the result was that additionalcattle and agricultural produce were being sent toGermany, and, to obviate this, some Danish ships carrying fodder were being released, so that the danish government could not advance the plea that the cattlewere being exported to Germany because they could notbe fed in Denmark, and that arrangements had alsobeen made to send Danish produce to Bergen fortranshipment in Norwegian vessels to British ports.It was stated by Lord Robert Cecil that, by Danish law, nomerchant ship belonging to that country could be transferred toanother flag without the permission of the Danish Government, andthat the Minister had informed him that, if the British Governmentrequisition the ships, it would be necessary for his Government tomake a very strong protest on the subject.The Minister for Blockade stated that the United States NavalWar Code, subject to certain arrangements, authorised the seizure of neutral merchant ships in belligerent waters, and that there wasno treaty stipulation between ourselves and Denmark that clearlyprevented such action on our part.The War Cabinet decided, having in view the small amount oftonnage involved (28,000 tons), that In the first instance, the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should see the American Ambassador and ascertain his personal view as to what would be the feeling in theUnited States if we requisitioned the Danish, Swedish, and dutch ships now held up in British waters.(Initialled) D. LI  G2, Whitehall Gardens, 8.W.,February 28, 1917.Detention, &amp;c., of neutral shipping in the UnitedKingdom.the contrary was received, it would he considered that theyhad no objection, and the Repo/t of the Dardanelles Corn-mission would be pixblished as soon as possible.
Extract from Proceedings of Meeting of War Committee held onSeptember 28, 1916 (W.C.-71, Appendix).Instructions of His Majesty&apos;s Government to the Comw.ander-in-Chief in India as to theMission of the Mesopotamia Expeditionary Force, dated September 28, 1916.THE mission of the Mesopotamia Expeditionary Force is to protect the oilfieldsand pipe lines in the vicinity of the Karun River, to maintain our occupation andcontrol of the Basra vilayet, and to deny hostile access to the Persian Gulf and southern Persia. No fresh advance to Baghdad can he contemplated at present, butit is the desire of His Majesty&apos;s Government, if and when possible, to establish British influence in the Baghdad vilayet. This further advance should not be undertakenunless and until sanction for it is given, but the General Officer Commanding shouldmeanwhile continue to improve the river and railway communications and maintain asforward a position as the state of his communications will allow, and as can be madesecure tactically without incurring heavy loss, whether caused by the enemy or byclimatic conditions. Military and political considerations connected with Nasiriyeh,the Muntifik, and Bani Lam tribes, and the push-i-Kuh Bakhtiari country suggestretention of our present positions if this can be achieved without undue sacrifices ; butwe desire your views as to the feasibility of this course. You will doubtless consultSir Percy Cox as to the effect on the Arabs of any withdrawal. Further, theMesopotamia Expeditionary Force should ensure that hostile parties do not work downsouth across the line Shushtar-Ispahan. You must not expect to receive further reinforcements for the force. On the contrary, it may become necessary to withdraw the Xlllth Division, which was sent to the country in order to assist in the attemptedrelief of Kut.APPENDIX II.Copy of telegram 2Vo. 878 of February 24, 1917, from General Officer CommandingMesopotamia Force to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff.IN view of the change brought about in situation by recent successes on Tigrisfront, I shall be glad to learn whether His Majes1y&apos;s Government in any way desire tomodify their instructions cOnveved to me in vour 23374 Cipher, dated the30th September, 19.16.Until I get your reply 1 do not propose to delay, but intend to follow up retreating-enemy closely, being careful, however, to do nothing which will prevent me fromadjourning my position readily according to your further orders. Enemy has sufferedvery severely during past 2-J- months and his losses have been out of all proportion tohis strength. Also we have captured over 4,500 prisoners besides guns and machine guns, rifles, ammunition, and material. This series of reverses would have completelybroken troops possessed of less fighting qualities than Turks. Opportunity would,therefore, seem favourable for further advance if this accords with policy&apos; of HisMajesty&apos;s Government. Scope of such advance would depend on information received as to further enemy reinforcements being diverted in this direction. Owing, however,to heavy losses already incurred by Turkish forces as above, these, unless considerably more than we anticipate at present, have now lost much of their value.
Agreement signed at Anglo-French Conference held at Calais,February 26 and 27, 1917.1. THE French War Committee and the British War Cabinet approve of theplan of operations on the Western Front as explained to them by General Nivelle and field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig on the 26th February, 1917.2. With the object of ensuring complete unity of command during the forth-coming military operations referred to above, the French War Committee and theBritish War Cabinet have agreed to the following arrangements : (1.) Whereas the primary object of the forthcoming military operations referredto in paragraph 1 is to drive the enemy from French soil, and whereas theFrench Army disposes of larger effectives than the British, the British WarCabinet recognises that the general direction of the campaign should be inthe hands of the French Commander-in-Chief.(2.) With this object in view, the British War Cabinet engages itself to direct theField-Marshal Commanding the British Expeditionary Force to conform hisplans of operation to the general strategical plans of the Commander-in-Chief of the French Army.(3.) The British War Cabinet further engages itself to direct that during theperiod intervening between the date of the signature of this agreement,and the date of the commencement of the operations referred to inparagraph 1, the Field-Marshal Commanding the British ExpeditionaryForce shall conform his preparations to the views of the Commander-in-Chiefof the French Army, except in so far as he considers that this would endanger the safety of his Army, or prejudice its success, and, in any case where Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig may feel bound on these grounds to depart from General nivelle&apos;s instructions, he shall report the action taken, together with the reasons for such action, to the Chief of theImperial General Staff, for the information of the British War Cabinet.(4.) The British War Cabinet further engages itself to instruct the Field-marshal commanding the British Expeditionary Force that, after the date of thecommencement of the forthcoming operations referred to in paragraph 1,and up to the termination of these operations, he shall conform to theorders of the Commander-in-Chief of the French Army in all matters relating to the conduct of the operations, it being understood that theBritish Commander will be left free to choose the means he will employ,and the methods of utilising his troops in that sector oE operations allotted to him by the French Commander-in-Chief in the original plan.(5.) The British War Cabinet and Government and the French Government, eachso far as concerns its own Army, will be the judge of the date at which theopera-dons referred to in paragraph 1 are to be considered as at an end.When so ended, the arrangement in force before the commencement of theoperations will be re-established.(Signed)      M.
