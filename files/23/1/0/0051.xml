Mesopotamia. 1. THE Director of Military Operations reported that steady progress was being made with operations on the Tigris. TheBritish casualties in the last three days were only 259. The Turksin this region had been reinforced by a division, which was satis-factory, as our object was to contain the largest possible Turkish forces.Portugal.2. The Chief of the War Staff reported that the Portuguese hadrelinquished the idea of escorting their transports to France. TheBritish, therefore, would have to send destroyers back to Lisbon forthe second convoy.The Loss of aBritish Submarine.3. The Chief of the War Staff reported that 43 officers and men had been rescued from the sunk submarine (War Cabinet, 48,Minute 9).Blockade of theUnited Kingdom,France, and Italy.4. The Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reportedthat information had now been received from several neutral countries announcing that the Germans had declared a blockade ofthe British Islands, France, and Italy from to-day, and had allowedneutral Governments four days of grace to withdraw their ships.The Dutch Government had decided to stop their ships from sailing.The War Cabinet agreed :-(1.) That fuller information was necessary before any finaldecision could be taken.(2.) That the Admiralty should prepare and submit to them alist of neutral vessels in Allied harbours..(3.) That the Secretary of State for India should address theIndian Government in the following sense : &quot; Please telegraph approximate numbers and total tonnage of neutral ships now in Indian waters.If desired, could you detain them quietly for three or four days, on Customs or other pretext, without giving public notice ? This may be necessary to counter new German blockade.&quot;(4.) That the Colonial Secretary should address Dominion and colonial Governments in similar terms.(5.) That, pending full and early examination of the whole situation created by the declaration of blockade, theAdmiralty should take steps to refuse clearance -unostentatiously, and without giving the real reason to neutral ships in home ports.Japanese Bequestfor Assurances asregards the Futureof German IslandsNorth of theEquator.5. With reference to the Japanese request for an assurance from His Majesty&apos;s Government that we will support their claims to the succession to Germany&apos;s position in Shantung, and to theretention of the captured German islands north of the Equator,Lord Hardinge explained that, from the Foreign Office point ofview, it was desirable to give the assurance as regards the islands,the retention of which by the Japanese was contemplated in the interim Report of Sir Louis Mallet&apos;s Committee on TerritorialChanges (G.I.D. Paper G.-118). The Secretary of State for theColonies laid stress on the necessity for consultation with theDominions before any decision could be taken by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment. He considered that in this Case Australia and ISiewZealand would assent, though not very willingly, to the assurancebeing given, if it was made clear to them that it was necessary, forthe purpose of securing the additional naval help from Japan whichhad been asked for by the Admiralty in the shape of extra destroyers
Shantung. 6. With regard to the request for an assurance as to theJapanese position in Shantung, the War Cabinet felt that this wasa matter which affected the Allies generally to a much greater extent than the question of the islands, and that consultation between the Allies was essential before any decision could be arrived at.The  War Cabinet also decided that any form of separatebargaining between the Allies was undesirable at this stage.The War Cabinet further agreed that before any decision couldbe arrived at on the question of Shantung, the ForeignOffice and Admiralty should severally submit, their viewson the political and strategical aspects of the case, and its relation to British policy in other parts of China, and thatany answer to Japan should be delayed pending consulta-tion with the Allies in regard to Shantung and the Islands,and with the Dominions in regard to the Islands.7. The Secretary of State for the Colonies read a telegram fromthe Governor-General of the Union of South Africa with referenceto the list of subjects for discussion at the Imperial Conference,which had been suggested by the Colonial Office. The SouthAfrican Ministers had not anticipated a discussion of post heliumcommercial relations, or of the future constitution of the Empire,more especially as General Botha himself could not be present.Mr. Long pointed out that, while this might be true of South AfricanMinisters, some of the other Dominion Ministers were particularly anxious to discuss these subjects, and that it was quite impossibleto ask the Australasian representatives to leave these matters asideand to come over again in a few months&apos; time.The War Cabinet, subject to the Prime Ministers concurrence,approved a telegram which the. Secretary of State for the Coloniesproposed to send to South Africa explaining the situation(Appendix II).ImperialConsultation withDominions andIndia.in the Mediterranean, and some additional cruisers in the Southt Atlantic, and that Japan, on her side, would recognise the Britishclaim to the German Pacific Colonies south of the Equator.The War Cabinet instructed the Secretary of State for theColonies to send a telegram to the Dominions, asking fortheir concurrence in the event of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment considering it desirable to give the required assurancebefore the forthcoming Imperial Consultation. The telegram was to lay stress on the need for Japanese naval assistance,and should make it clear that no assurance would be given without a corresponding assuiance from Japan of hersupport to British claims south of the Equator, and toBritish policy generally, and that there would be nopublication of the assurance without British consent(Appendix I).The Secretary of State for the Colonies urged that the ForeignOffice should, whenever a similar case could be by any possibility regarded as affecting the Dominions, informforeign countries that His Majesty&apos;s Government mustconsult the Dominions before sending a reply. He pointedout that this might really be useful to the Foreign office for many reasons, and besides this, it would be appreciatedby the Dominions.
Entertainment ofRepresentatives of dominions andIndia.Discipline of theAustralian Troops.8. The question of social engagements during the sessions ofthe Conference was raised, and the Secretary of State for theColonies was instructed to communicate with the Dominion ministers with a view to leaving the arrangements of any entertainments of apublic character in the hands of the Colonial Office. The IndiaOffice was to keep in touch with the Colonial Office on thisquestion.9. The Secretary of State for the Colonies reported that his attention had been drawn by the Adjutant-General to the fact that,under the Australian military law, men could not be shot fordesertion or cowardice, and that it created a difficult situation atthe Front if Englishmen or Canadians, guilty of such offences, were shot, while Australians were not liable to the death penalty.The War Cabinet authorised the Secretary of State for theColonies to communicate with the Governor-General of Australia toascertain if au amendment of the Australian law in this respectcould be carried out.The supply situation.10. The War Cabinet remitted for discussion between the quartermaster-General and the Fourth Sea Lord of the Admiralty,in the first instance, the question of the supplies to the severaltheatres of war, raised in a Memorandum by the Quarter-Master-Generai, dated the 24th January, 1917. The question shotild onlybe brought before the War Cabinet in the event of failure to reach an agreement.The ChannelTunnel.11. The War Cabinet had before them the following Papers : (a.) A Memorandum by the Secretary, dated the 23rd October,1916 (C.I.D. Paper 88-A),&quot;on the Channel tunnel project.Note by the Secretary, dated the 31st January, 1917,bringing the above Memorandum up to date, and statingthat the question would probably be raised again shortlyin Parliament (Appendix III).(b.) AThe War Cabinet decided That the reopening of the question at the present juncture waspremature; that its official reconsideration should be postponed until after the conclusion of peace ; and that, ifnecessity should arise, a statement to this effect should bemade in both Houses of Parliament.Compensation forRequisitioning theSteamship &quot;ConteRosso.&quot;12. The War Cabinet authorised the Shipping Controller tonegotiate with the Italian owners of the steamship &quot; Conte Rosso,&quot;which had been requisitioned by the British Government as aseaplane-carrier, on the basis of a payment not exceeding 50,000Z.as compensation.German Prisonerspf War Employedin the WesternZone of Operations.13- With reference to the War Cabinet&apos;s decision on this subject at their Meeting on the 30th January, 1917 (War Cabinet, 48,.Minute 14), the Adjutant-General reported the action that he hadtaken consequent on the above decision. He stated that information had been received from the British military attache in Paris to theeffect that the French military authorities had informed the German
1Government that they would withdraw German prisoners 20 kilo-metres from the firing-line, and that no German prisoners had beenemployed in any fire-swept zone, in handling munitions, or withinmedium artillery range (Appendix TV)*The Cabinet decided that Our policy in this matter should be made to conform to that adopted by the French military authorities, and that theArmy Council should issue the necessary instructionsaccordingly to the Field-Marshal Commanding-in-chief the British Expeditionary Force in the event of theacceptance of the proposal by the German Government.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,February 1, 1917.* The O.I.G.S. pointed out that, although it would be undesirable to adopt a policy differing from that adopted by the French, the withdrawal of the present companies for 20 kilometres behind our firing line should interfere with the urgent work now being executed on roads and railways, and consequently would tend to retard those preparations for certain operations to which the Cabinet attached the utmost importance-He asked that this should be clearly understood.
Paraphrase Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to theGovernor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia.(Sent 6*45 f.m. February 1, 1917.)FOLLOWING message received from Japanese Government : &quot; Having regard to possibility of peace conference at some future date, it isconsidered by the Japanese Government tbat the time bas come to approach HisMajesty&apos;s Government with a view to obtaining from them an assurance of tbeirwillingness to support Japan&apos;s claims in regard to disposal of Germany&apos;s rights inShantung and possessions in islands north of the Equator on the occasion of such aconference. His Excellency said that an announcement had lately been published4&apos;that eventual occupation of Constantinople by Russia had been assented to by theAllies, and a special agreement had been signed in connection with the entry of Italyinto the war. These and other possible international arrangements in the future hadbeen discussed between Viscount Grey and Japanese Ambassador in London from timeto time. Japanese Government hoped that, in these circumstances, they might nowreceive an assurance from His Majesty&apos;s Government in the sense desired. ImperialGovernment would, on receiving such an assurance, next approach French and russian Governments with a similar request.&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government had intended to address a full despatch to you on thesubject of the disposal of the German colonies in the Pacific, and, if possible, todiscuss matter with your Prime Minister, and they much regret that the urgency of thematter compels them to raise the question in this form.His Majesty&apos;s Government are very unwilling to give any pledge to Japan beforepeace negotiations, and doubt, indeed, whether they are justified in so doing withoutconsent of their Allies, but Admiralty are very anxious to secure some additionallight cruisers in South Atlantic to deal with enemy raiders and additional destroyersto cope with submarines in Mediterranean.Japan was very recently asked by His Majesty&apos;s Government for naval assistance in this direction, and for this reason they desire to be in a position to give some undertaking, if necessary, showing that they are willing to meet wishes of Japanas regards islands north of the Equator. The question of Shantung is one of greatdifficulty and complexity, but the islands are in Japanese possession, and to induceher to surrender them would be practically impossible. We should not therefore, infact, be giving up anything if we recognise Japan&apos;s claim to the islands, and I shouldbe glad to learn that, should His Majesty&apos;s Government find themselves unable, beforethe conference meets, to avoid giving some pledge on the subject, your Ministers areprepared to acquiesce. In any case, no assurance would be given without acorresponding assurance from Japan that they will support us in our general policyand in our retention of German Pacific colonies south of Equator. Desired assurancenot to be made public without consent of His Majesty&apos;s Government. Long.APPENDIX II.Paraphrase Telegram from the Governor-General of the union of South Africa to theSecretary of State for the Colonies.(Received Colonial Office, 6.55 p.m., January 30, 1917.)(Private and Personal.)YOUR secret telegram of 26th January as to the War Conference.It was understood here from telegram of 25th December, and Prime&apos; Minister&apos;sspeech, that Conference with War Cabinet would be entirely or primarily concernedwith questions under headings 1. 2, and 3(a), and possibly transitory provisions sucKas those contained in (b) of Paris Economic Conference. t
Paraphrase Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to theGovernor-General of the Union of South Africa.(Sent 11*15 p.m., February 1, 1917.)(Private and Personal.)YOUR telegram of 30th January : Conference.Views of your Government will receive careful consideration by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment. There is much force in their view as to 3 (c), and undoubtedly it wouldbe most desirable that Botha should be present when this is discussed. But it wouldseem impossible to decline to discuss question if other Dominions wished to raise it.I &quot;know that New Zealand regards it as the most important matter for the Conference.The same considerations apply as regards 3 (6) and commercial policy generally.It must be remembered that if the Empire is to protect itself against Germancommercial penetration after the war, all necessary measures must have been preparedfor putting into execution immediately after peace, and this will take much time. Itcannot be expected that Australasian Premiers will return at an early date after forth-coming Conference has dispersed. Long.APPENDIX HI.The Channel Tunnel.Note by the Secretary.THE Memorandum (C.I.D. Paper, 88-A) on the Channel Tunnel, which has been-circulated with the Agenda for to-morrow&apos;s meeting, was prepared by the direction ofthe late Prime Minister in order to place him au courant with the position as regardsthe history and development of the project when he received a deputation chosenfrom the House of Commons Channel Tunnel Committee on the 26th October, 1916.The deputation, headed by Mr. Arthur Fell, the Chairman of the above Committee,urged upon Mr. Asquith the importance, in view of the experience gained during theWar, of obtaining Parliamentary sanction for the construction of the tunnel, so thatthe work might be undertaken at the earliest possible moment after the termination ofhostilities.The latest views of the three Government Departments mainly concerned are summarised in paragraph 17 of my Memorandum, and are given in extenso inAppendices II, III, and IV. They agreed generally that the official reconsideration of the scheme should be postponed until after the conclusion of peace, whenHis Majesty&apos;s Government would be able to decide what was to be their future military policy, and also to review the project in its financial aspect under theconditions then obtaining.Mr. Asquith, in his reply to the deputation, said that, in his opinion, the matter should be reviewed by the War Committee, or by the Committee of Imperial defence in all its aspects, and that they should be required to express their judgment upon it.He further promised that, subject to the paramount obligations of making provisionfor the successful prosecution of the war, time would be found, and opportunity givenfor a full reconsideration of the question.It is probable that when Parliament meets the matter will again be raised at anearly date, and the Prime Minister will be pressed to state what steps have been takento give effect to the engagement then entered upon by his predecessor.We did not anticipate that 3 (b) would form part of the Conference, still less 3 (c)f^It was thought that they would he discussed at subsequent conferences. The view ofthe Government here is that 3 (c) would better be discussed after peace rather than inconnection with it.It would appear essential that General Botha should be present, if and when 3 (c)is discussed.Please let me know views of His Majesty&apos;s Government. J. C. Smuts has read,and agrees with above. General Botha away, but we are certain that his views are thesame. Buxton.
My reason therefore for bringing the question up at this moment is to ask for the instruction of the War Cabinet as to what action is to be taken.; . (Initialed) M. P. A. H.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,; January 31, 1*917.APPENDIX IV.A Minute by the Adjutant-General to Secretary, War Cabinet, dated the31st January, 1917.(Telegrams contained in this Minute have been paraphrased.)IN reply to a telegram to General Headquarters asking what the effect would beof removal of German prisoners of war to a radius of It) miles behind our front linetrenches, the following cable has been received : &quot; A (P) 80, 31st January, 4847, D.P.R.M.&quot; The removal of the said companies beyond the 10-mile limit must greatlydisorganise the road repair work, the necessity for which is urgent. Only one german prisoner has been wounded, which sufficiently indicates the precautionstaken to retain prisoners beyond the danger zone. The usual limit outside whichthese prisoners are employed is 8 kilom., and I strongly advise that no alterationshould be made in this limit. Insistence upon the extension of the present limit to a radius of 10 miles would involve the loss of the services of 24 companies now employed on road repair. Chief, G.H.Q.&quot;On receipt of this cable the General Headquarters, France, were asked whetherthe labour which would be displaced by prisoners of war being removed further backcould not be utilised in present position nearer the front line. No answer has yet beenreceived.Telegrams were sent to the Military Attache in Paris and to the liaison officer atFrench General Headquarters, to which the following replies have been received :  From M.A., Paris, to D.M.T., January 31, 1917.(8111.)&quot;lour telegram 28679, dated 29th January. German authorities threatenedreprisals if French did not consent not to employ any German prisoners within aradius of 30 kilom. of the front firing line, and they placed in German trenches certainFrench prisoners, without waiting for any reply from the French authorities. french general Headquarters replied on the 15th January that they would agree to withdrawGerman prisoners of war to a distance of 20 kilom. from the front firing line. they also stated that they had not employed any German prisoners in any zone which wasswept by fire. No reply has been vouchsafed by Germany to this last communication of the French authorities up to date, and our belief is that French prisoners have not.yet been removed from the German trenches.&quot;From Colonel Cavendish to D.M.I., dated January 31, 1917.&quot; Your 28779.&quot; 1. The French did employ German prisoners of war, but they were not used forthe handling of munitions, and they were not employed within medium artillery range.No exact distance from the front line had been fixed for their employment.&quot; 2. A protest was received from the German authorities, who demanded that prisoners should in no circumstances be used at a less distance than 30 kilom. fromthe front trenches.&quot; 3. The French authorities fixed the limit at 20 kilom.&quot;C. F. N. M., A.G.January .1, 1917.
