WITH reference to the decision of the War Cabinet on the22nd January, 1917 (War Cabinet, 40, Minute 16), by which navalshipbuilding programme &quot; B &quot; (Appendix I) was approved, the WarCabinet had under consideration a revised Programme &quot; C&quot; of naval construction (Appendix II), prepared at their request by theAdmiralty, on the hypothesis that the war would last throughoutthe year 1918 (War Cabinet, 40, Minute 17), together with a noteby the Shipping Controller, showing that the entire naval programmeif proceeded with would result in a reduction of about 450,000 grosstons* in the output of merchant shipping (Appendix III).The First Lord of the Admiralty stated that the Boardconsidered that &quot; C &quot; was the minimum programme theycould put forward in order to provide for the whole of theyear 1918.The Admiralty pointed out that the existing British battle cruisers were greatly inferior to the German battle cruisers, both inprotection and speed, and that strategically this meant that theGerman, battle cruisers could make raiding attacks on the east coast, and on shipping, without any probability of their being brought to action, much less defeated. The fact was established that the battle cruiser situation would not be improrc I by thecompletion of this programme in either 1917 or 1918, and that wecould not even be in a position of equality before 1919.* Mote. Sir Joseph500,000 gross tons.Maclay  now  states that the figure should  probably  be raised *Cl  about
The War Cabinet recognise that, in view of the impossibility of forecasting the naval situation in the latter year,whether peace had been restored by that time or not, they assume a grave responsibility in cutting down this Programme &quot; C&quot;. Havingregard, however, to the imperative need of concentrating our efforts in other directions for the successful prosecution of the war, andthe great reduction which this Naval Programme, if carried out inits entirety, would make on merchant shipbuilding, the WarCabinet decided that :-- - V-&quot;-:. &apos;   . :    t.        &apos;(a.) H.M.S. &quot;Hood&quot; should be completed with all despatch,but that work should cease on the 3 remaining battle cruisers of her class, unless it could be continued without detriment to the output of merchant shipping.(fe.) The light cruisers of the &quot;Raleigh&quot; class should becompleted with all despatch.II.The 5 light cruisers should not.be laid down. ...HI and IV.With regard to the proposed increase of 48 torpedo-boatdestroyers and 6 flotilla leaders, the Admiralty were requested to reconsider this question with the object of only utilising firms who specialised in the construction oftorpedo-boat destroyers, and as soon as possible render afurther report as to what could be done by only usingthese resources.It was decided that the question of the number of flotillaleaders was to depend on the number of destroyers that could be so constructed.V V.The extra 20 convoy and &quot; Q &quot; sloops should be taken in handas soon as practicable.VI.The additional 8 paddle minesweepers and 32 screw mini-sweepers should be laid down as circumstances require.vii.The 18 additional &quot; L &quot; class submarines and 18 additional&quot; L &quot; cruiser submarines asked for should be constructed.VIII.The additional 50 trawlers should be built, raising the totaltrawler programme to 500.IX.The 30 additional boom vessels should be laid down.
Increase of Speed 2. The Shipping Controller undertook to examine and report,of Merchant Ships. with. the aid of his Advisory Committee, on the practicability ofincreasing the speed (10^ knots) of the new merchant ships, havingregard to the fact that the submerged speed of the latest german submarines was about 11 knots, and to the relatively small lossesamongst the faster types of merchant ships.Iron Ore from 3. The War Cabinet decided Spain.To ask the War Office, assisted by the Foreign Office asrequisite, to consider and report on the possibility of developing the overland route from Spain to the north ofFrance, with a view to the safer transport of iron ore, &amp;c,from the former country.(Initialled)      D. LI. G.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,February 9, 1917.The 24 mercantile &quot; Q &quot; ships should be provided, subject to an examination by the Board of Admiralty as to thepossibility of fitting the hulls of some of these vessels with,anti-submarine defence.XLPending the decision of the United States &apos;of America as towhether they take part in the war or not, the admiralty were asked to suspend the construction of the 6 liners and transports.XII.The 4 seaplane carriers were [essential to the Fleet, in spite ofthe length of time (about 15 months) that they would take to build, and the War Cabinet therefore approved theirconstruction.XHI.The 3 minelayers of mercantile type should not be laid down.The War Cabinet note that the Admiralty do not now proposeto build the 6 patrol boats authorised by Programme &quot; B.&quot;

Naval Shipbuilding Programme &quot; C &quot; and the Mercantile Marine Position.(1.)      . -Dear Colonel Hankey, February 5, 1917.NAVAL Shipbuilding Programme.In accordance with your letter of the 3rd instant, the Shipping Controller had anintervie\this   morning with the Admiralty, and he has now addressed a communication to Sir Edward Carson, copy of which is enclosed, stating how, in his view, the new programme will affect the mercantile marine position.It practically amounts to this : that instead of getting 1,200,000 tons of shippingthis year, only about 750,000 tons would be obtained, which, as the Prime minister will grasp, would be a most serious loss.Yours truly,(Signed)      JOHN ANDERSON.Lieutenant-Colonel. Sir M. P. A. Hankey, K.C.B.,Committee of Imperial Defence,2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.(2.)Dear Sir, February 5, 1917.In accordance with the request of the Third Sea Lord, the Controller of shipping has examined the new Programme of shipbuilding for Navy purposes submitted to him at the meeting this morning.On the basis of the old Navy Programme, it was intimated that there was good reason to anticipate an output of about 700.000 tons of mercantile shipping during thefirst six months of 1917, and about 500,000 tons during the second half of 1917, makinga total of 1,200,000 tons for this year, but on the basis of the new Programme ofacceleration of Navy ships now building and new ships to be laid down, the Controllerwould not expect delivery of over about 750,000 gross tons during the whole year, forthe mercantile marine. It is possible that under the new system of payment by results,and a reasonable increase in the supply of material, some improvement on the abovemight be made.The First Lord will therefore realise how very serious the position will become forthe mercantile marine if the new Programme is proceeded with.The papers handed to the Controller, including the new Programme marked&quot; Very Secret,&quot; are herewith returned.Yours sincerely,(Initialled)      J. A.The Private Secretary to Sir Edward Carson,Admiralty, S.W.o
