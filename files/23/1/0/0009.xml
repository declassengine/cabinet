The German Peace 2. In connection with the German proposals for peace, the WarProposals. Cabinet decided thatThe Foreign Office should send a telegram to the FrenchGovernment explaining that, in the judgment of theBritish Government, if the terms of the German Note areas reported in the newspapers, the present peace move-ment, inaugurated by the German Chancellor, could onlybe regarded as a political manoeuvre; that the BritishGovernment were desirous of obtaining the viewrs of theFrench Government on the best method of dealing withthe situation.; and that an early communication was desired, as the Prime Minister would have to allude to thesubject in Parliament on Tuesday, 19th December.Irish Railways Decision of theGovernment totake over.Attended for thisQuestion:The Et; Hon. H. E.Duke, K.C., M.P.,Chief Secretaryfor Ireland.Sir Albert Stanley,President of theBoard of Trade.3. The Chief Secretary for Ireland explained the presentsituation in regard to railways in that country, where an immediategeneral strike was threatened. The trouble arose from the inade-quate wages paid by the railway companies to large classes of theirservants. These wages, before the war, did not exceed, for large sections of the employees, 15s. a week, and even now barely reached in these classes an average of 17s. The railways themselves were ofthree classes: the Great Southern and Western and the GreatNorthern, which are on an ordinary footing and pay dividends ; theMidland and Great Western, which just pay their way; and theremainder, which are financially waterlogged. Mr. Duke explainedthat, during his tenure of office, the companies had conceded certainbonuses, but in the case of the poorer companies these bonuses were as low as one or two shillings. Further concessions on the partof the companies might have staved off a crisis had the politiciansheld aloof. Two weeks ago, however, he became aware that organisedaction was being taken, and some days later that notices had beenissued announcing that all work would be suspended at midnightto-night. The gravity of the present situation lay in the fact thatorganised labour had joined hands with organised political force,and it was evident that the Irish Nationalist party were ready totake charge of the railway trouble and use their political power tosecure a settlement at their dictation. There was the furtherdanger that if the railwaymen went on strike, other Irish industries,and possibly the English railways, might take sympathetic action.There are about 22,000 raihyaymen in Ireland involved, and thedemand is for an additional 10s. a week. If the full demand isconceded, and the Government are prepared to find the money, theannual charge on the Treasury would be about 500,000LThe President of the Board of Trade agreed that there was aserious danger of English railway employees at various centrestaking sympathetic action. He said that he had sent Mr. Marwood,of his Department, over to Ireland in order to keep him in close touch with the situation. His own view wras that the eventualnationalisation of all railways in the United Kingdom wras almostinevitable. In fact, he suggested that it might become necessaryfor the Government to take over the Irish railways at an early date in order to release Irish railway material, as well as the Britishmaterial already being set free, for use in France. The Irishrailway companies desired either that they might be allowed to raisetheir rates (which would be resisted by the Nationalist party inParliament), or that Government would guarantee them against loss in order to enable them to grant additional bonuses.In order to meet the existing situation, which is critical and demands immediate action, the War Cabinet decided that: All railways in Ireland should be taken over by the Govem-ment, and that a public  announcement to this effect
frtmtbd at the fobeigh okbtcb by c. k. habbisoit.-20/12/16.should be made at once. They, considered that, as thenegotiations would be primarily industrial rather thanpolitical in their character, they should be conducted bythe President of the Board of Trade, who undertook to actin close concert with the Chief Secretary for Ireland, whowould be the (medium for any necessary action on thepolitical side.(Initialled) A.
