The western front: The Ancre.1. The Director of Military Intelligence briefly described thepreliminaries which had led to the recent advance, and stated thatthe ground newly occupied by the British extended over a front ofabout 11 miles from the East of Geudecourt to the South ofGommecourt, with a depth of 2 miles, and included the village ofSerre and the Butte de Warlecourt. He reported that practically no opposition had been offered except at Irles, and that only a fewprisoners and, according to present information, no guns had beentaken. The withdrawal of the enemy had been carried out undercover of misty weather, which precluded aerial reconnaissance.Mesopotamia. 2. In regard to the recent successful attacks by our troops inMesopotamia, the War Cabinet agreed that it was desirable, so soonas the immediate operations were concluded, to determine our future policy and to define our military commitments in that theatre. The Director of Military Intelligence was instructed to request the Chief of the Imperial General Staff to submit to the WarCabinet his views on the subject at an early date.Submarines.3 The First Sea Lord reported that an enemy submarine hadbeen engaged, and repeatedly hit, by a British trawler 180 miles south-West of Crete ; and that a British submarine had returned fromlaying mines along the German coast.Publication ofShipping Losses.4. The First Sea Lord presented to the War Cabinet the firstweekly table (Appendix I) of arrivals and sailings, and showingthe numbers of vessels sunk or attacked and escaped during theweek ending the Sfith February, 1917 (War Cabinet, 75, Minute 3).He submitted for consideration whether the report should bepublished in the press daily or weekly, and, if published weekly,whether the report should show the arrivals, sailings, losses, &amp;c, foreach day, or only the totals for the week. In his view, a daily issueof arrivals and sailings would, in the event of any general hold-upof traffic for any reason, clearly show the enemy what had occurred.He understood that all publication by Lloyds&apos; of individual losses ofships would cease alter the issue of the first table.After some discussion, in the course of which the First Sea&quot;Lord undertook to enquire-whether it would be feasible to publish the tonnage as well  as   the  number   of arrivals and sailings,The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The report, should be published weekly.(b.) The report should be in the form submitted by the first sea Lord at the Meeting, subject  to  the followingprovisos : (1.) Figures of Neutral and Allied vessels sunkshould be excluded.(2.) Fishing vessels sunk should be not includedunless the First Lord expressed a desire for publication.(3.) The numbers only and not the tonnage ofvessels should be published, but thatdiscrimination should probably be made between vessels of over 1,600 tons andthose of less tonnage.The War Cabinet further decided that The table in its present form, giving full particulars, should beprepared weekly for their own information.
Restriction ofImports:Vegetables andFruit for the Fleet.5. The War Cabinet further considered this question (WarCabinet, 80, Minute 11). Mr. Wintour pointed out that the purchaseof fresh fruit for the Services need not present any difficulties orinterfere with any decisions arrived at in regard to the restriction of Imports, because the Admiralty could buy direct, and the shipments could be made as naval stores in requisitioned tonnage.The War Cabinet decided that The overseas supplies of fruit to the Navy, including the giftsfrom the Dominions referred to in Lord Beresford&apos;s letterof the 20th February, 1917 (Appendix II), should beallowed to be continued, and not be included in theImport Restrictions.Colonial Fruit. 6. With regard to the effect of the new regulations on the ship-ments of fruit from the Dominions and Colonies, the War cabinet decided that Sir H. Babington Smith should be asked to re-assemble someof the members of his Committee on Restriction of Imports,who should examine the recommendations of the various government Departments concerned, in respect of over-coming the difficulties created by the new restrictions, andreport to the War Cabinet in what degree those recommendations are acceptable and feasible.Imports onGovernmentAccount.7. The President of the Board of Trade urged that the CustomsAuthorities should keep a record of all imports, whether entered as government property or otherwise ; that records of imports on ordinary trade account should be kept separate from those on government account; and that all Government Departments shouldbe instructed to take the necessary steps to assist in procuring this information.Sir Joseph Maclay pointed out that the Tonnage Priority-Committee a newly formed Interdepartmental committee underthe chairmanship of Sir L. Chiozza Money is already collectinginformation in regard to shipments on Government account.The War Cabinet decided that Sir H. Babington Smith&apos;s Committee should be asked toconsider what further steps, if any, should be taken with aview to records being kept of all imports (a.) On Government account ;(6.) On ordinary trade account;and should report to the War Cabinetj2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W ,February 21, 1917.(Initialled)A B- L.

Vegetables and Fruit eor the Fleet.(Correspondence between Secretary, War Cabinet; Fourth Sea Lord ; Lord Beresford ;and Secretary, Vegetable Products Committee.)I.Fourth Sea Lord to Secretary, War Cabinet.Dear Colonel Hankey, February 23, 1917.WILL you kindly look at the enclosed copies of two letters that I have receivedfrom Lord Beresford and the Secretary of the Vegetable Products Committee,respectively? I have spoken to Sir Edward Carson regarding the matter, and he has asked me to consult with you about it.The work of the Committee is of very great importance to the health of the Fleet,and we are of opinion that it is extremely desirable that the concession asked forshould be granted if possible. Would you be good enough to bring it to the notice ofthe Prime Minister as soon as may be convenient ?Sincerely yours,(Signed) LIONEL HALSEY.II.Lord Beresford to Fourth Sea Lord.My dear Commodore, 1, Great Cumberland Place, W., February 20, 1917.Please excuse dictation.You know all about the Vegetable Products Committee, the immense amount ofwork they have done, and the brilliant organisation of Mr. Dyer, which has enabled the officers and men of the Fleet to keep healthy during their long and arduous work by supplying fresh fruit and vegetables.I am very much afraid that under the new restrictions with regard to the curtailment of fruit imports from overseas our supplies to the Fleet may be decreased.As you know, most of the gifts from overseas are given free conveyance bymerchant ships. I wrote to every single shipping company, and every Dominion,myself when Mr. Dyer first started his organisation, and every one of them replied and sent us fruit and vegetables.I do not like to bother the First Lord now, as he is in dhe middle of the navy estimates, but I think you might do so, as you. can see him for two minutes and gethim to speak to the Prime Minister, as there is no question as to the importance ofthese fresh vegetables and fruit for the men. If you can do that, I will write to thePrime Minister myself.Yours sincerely,(Signed) CHARLES BERESFORD.Commodore Lionel Halsey.III.Secretary, Vegetable Products Committee, to Fourth Sea Lord:Vegetable Products Committee.&apos; Alderman&apos;s House, Alderman&apos;s Wald, EC,Dear Commodore Halsey, February 19, 1917.Very many thanks for your letter of the 17th instant, enclosing the revised copyof your speech and for consenting to its circulation amongst our many branches. Iam confident that it will have a most gratifying effect.I am very loth to trouble you in the miclst of your infinitely more important and urgent duties, nor would I do so except in a case of exceptional importance, but thefollowing matter is one upon which I believe that you will think with me.
In the &quot; Daily Mail &quot; of Saturday, the 17th instant, a report appeared from whichI quote the following : &quot; The statement which the Prime Minister proposed to make on Monday willhe delayed until later in the week.....The restrictions recommended tothe Government by its Special Committee include a curtailment of fruit imports.It is expected that apples and oranges and probably bananas will be prohibited.....&quot;If these restrictions are carried out, it will have a very serious effect on our supplies to the Fleet. Gifts of apples and oranges reach us in large quantity from canada, South Africa, the United States, and Spain, with bananas and grape fruit fromthe West Indies, onions from Egypt, and. canned pineapples from the straits settlements.Would it be possible for you to secure the First Sea Lord&apos;s help in getting thePremier to exempt from these restrictions all overseas gifts for the Army and Navy,especially in respect of shipments which are given free conveyance by merchant ships ?If you agree that such freely carried supplementary supplies for the Navy shouldnot be prohibited, and if you will kindly move in the matter in the proper quarter,might I suggest immediate action before the PremiePs annotmcement, otherwise theeffect of the latter would be to entirely shut off all our oversea supplies, which at thepresent time is the only source we are able to draw on ?Yours very truly,(Signed).....      E. JEROME DYER,Hon. General Secretary.Commodore Lionel Halsey, R.N.o
