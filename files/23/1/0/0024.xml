A. Henderson, M.P.Kedlestok, KG., C.C.S.T., G.C.I.E.The Right Hon. the Viscount  Milner,G.C.B., G.C.M.G.The Right Hon. A. Bonar Law, M.P.Pn attendance :The Right Hon. A. J.

S. Amery, M.P., Assistant Secretary.Greece.    . 1. The  War    Cabinet   had   before   them   a   number  of communications from the French Government, all v urging thatGeneral Sarrail should be given a free hand to take such action as he thought fit in Greece, notably, a letter dated the 30th December,191(5 (Appendix I), from M. A. de Fleuriau to Mr. Balfour, anda communication from General Lyautey to the Chief of theImperial General Staff (Appendix II). It did not appear that theFrench Government themselves based their apprehensions on any definite evidence, but confined themselves to a general expression of misgiving. The evidence presented to the War Cabinet by theForeign Office, the Admiralty, and the General Staff, did not furnishconfirmation of the alarmist tone of the French communications.The information, received by the General Staff was to the effect thatthe Greeks were carrying out their undertakings. Up to the28th December, 1916, 4,600 men from Larissa, part of 1 division from Epirus, 22 guns, 36 machine guns, and 20,000 rifles hadalready been moved.In the absence of any definite evidence that a sudden coup wasbeing prepared by the King of Greece, the War Cabinet considered it important that Both General Sarrail and General Milne should attend theforthcoming Conference to be held in Italy.[1365-24] BThe Anglo-French-Italian Conference.Attended for thisQuestion, and sub-jects 2 to 8 :Admiral Sir J. E.Jfcllieoe, First sea lord.General Sir W. B.Robertson, Chiefof the Imperial(General Staff&apos;.
They therefore arranged with the Secretary of State for.Foreign Affairs To explain to the Italian and French Governments that thePrime Minister would have to leave London the next day,as he would have to be back in the following week, and- /that, as time would also have to be given for general sarrail to reach the place of Conference, the conference should be held as early as possible in Rome or at Naples.2. In reference to the reports of Greek ill-faith, communicated by the French The War Cabinet also instructed the Chief of ,the ImperialGeneral Staff to telegraph to General Milne to inform him that  such  reports had been received, and to enquire&apos; whether he had any intelligence in confirmation of them.3. The War Cabinet arranged that The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should telegraph- tothe French Government pointing out that their apprehen-sions as regards possible Greek action were contrary tothe information in our possession. If the FrenchGovernment considered that the intelligence at their disposal was sufficiently important to justify a reversal ofthe instructions which it had been agreed at the recentAnglo-French Conference should be given ^ to general sarrail, then the Secretary of State must insist that theyshould furnish the British Government with the evidenceupon which their statements were based.4. It was also arranged that  .* The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should telegraph tothe British Minister at Athens to inform him of the statements being made by the French, and to enquire whether he had any confirmation of them.-5. The War Cabinet farther decided that The Foreign Office should warn the British Minister at Athensby telegram that he might be required to attend theAnglo-French-Italian Conference in Italy, at the same timenotifying the French Government that Sir Francis Elliotmight attend.British Colony at 6. In reference to telegram No. 2110 of the 10th December,Athens. from the British Minister at Athens, the Yvar Cabinet decidedthat The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should direct theBritish Minister at Athens to arrange with the Vice-Admiral Commanding Eastern Mediterranean to remove the ship containing the British Colony to any convenientisland where those on board could be fed and suitablyaccommodated.
The Possibility of attacking the Greek-Communications atthe Corinth Canal.7. The First. Sea Lord reported that if the Greeks mountedhowitzers inland ;for the defence of the approaches to the CorinthCanal, it would he impossible for the Allied Fleet to maintain a continuous interruption of communication between the Morea and continental Greece. He stated also that he had instructed the vice--Admiral Commanding Eastern Mediterranean that, should itbecome necessary to destroy the bridge over the Corinth Canal, itwas very desirable that all craft which might possibly be used bythe Greeks for ferrying the troops across should be seized. He was of opinion that, if howitzers were mounted, the fleet could con-siderably delay communication but could not interrupt it altogether.The same difficulty would apply with regard to interference withGreek communications between Euboea and the mainland.Belgium and thePeace Note.Persia.The Situation inthe South.Attended for thisQuestion and sub-jects 10 to 13 :Mr. A. Chamberlain,Secretary of Statefor India.Consultation withthe Dominions andIndia.   (ImperialConference.)Attended for thisQuestion and s-ub-jecis 11 to 13 :Mr. W. Long, Secre-tary of State forthe Colonies.Mr. Hughes&apos;Attendance.Influence of irish situation inAustralia.S. Lord Curzon read out to the War Cabinet a private letter hehad received from the King of the Belgians, in reply to one written by Lord Curzon in reference to the subject of the answer by theAllied Nations to the German Peace Note.9. The Secretary of State for India drew attention to the&apos;situation in South Persia, where military operations involving thepossibility of serious entanglement were at present being conductedunder the control of the Foreign Office.It was decided that The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should invite adecision of the War Cabinet on the question of the controlof these operations.10. With reference to Minute 6 of the 23rd December (WarCabinet, 16), the War Cabinet discussed a draft telegram to theDominions, suggested by the Secretary of State for the Colonies,conveying the willingness of His Majesty&apos;s Government to welcomeother Dominion Ministers whom the Prime Ministers might desire tobring, on the understanding that they would not be actuallyMembers of the War Cabinet, and to arrange facilities for theirconferring outside the War Cabinet on questions which they desiredto raise with His Majesty&apos;s Government. The Secretary of Statefor the Colonies pointed out that there might be several ofthese questions which the more outlying Dominions might be anxious to discuss, and that it would be a great inconvenience tothem if they could not be discussed while they were over for thespecial session of the War Cabinet. This was generally agreed to,though it was felt that it would be undesirable to make it appear asif a formal Imperial Conference on the lines of the regular ImperialConference wras contemplated.(The Secretary of State&apos;s telegram, as finally approved, is printed in Appendix III).11. A telegram from the Prime Minister of Australia to thePrime Minister was read out, in which the former explained thedifficulties in the way of his attending the War Cabinet under present political conditions in Australia, laying great stress uponIrish opposition to the wrar, arising from the absence of asettlement of the Irish Question, as a principal factor in the unsatisfactory political situation in Australia (Appendix III).The Secretary of State for the Colonies undertook to telegraphconfidentially with regard to the Australian situation to theGovernor-General of the Commonwealth, whose reply wouldbe circulated to the War Cabinet.
Representation ofIndia.12. The Secretary of State for India brought forward thesuggestion that a representative of the Native Princes of india should attend the special session of the War Cabinet, in additionto the two assessors to the Secretary of State, who had beenagreed upon. The difficulties arising in the future out of the precedent that would be created, and the possible objection onthe part of the Dominions, were discussed. On the latter point, theSecretary of State for the Colonies suggested that the dominion prime Ministers would be more likely to agree if a satisfactory arrangement could be made for the attendance of their colleagues,and it was generally felt that the extreme colour prejudice on thepart of the Dominions had been modified by the events of the war.It was decided to await a reply from the Viceroy to a telegram.   which had been sent by the Secretary of State for India.India&apos;s Share inthe War.Rifles forRoumania.13. As regards military assistance, India could undoubtedly do more if colour were not regarded as a bar to a commission, and ifrifles and other requisites were forthcoming. The last consignmentof rifles promised to India Avere, Mr. Chamberlain understood, nowbeing diverted to fulfil a promise to Roumania. As regards financialassistance, the Secretary of State for India mentioned that theViceroy had suggested a 50,000,0001. contribution from India, whichthe late Government had not considered sufficient to create a goodimpression here. A subsequent suggestion that Indian securitiesmight be floated in America to provide dollar credit had not provedfeasible, and he was now proposing to ask the Viceroy if Indiacoeld possibly contribute 100,000,0001. As regards unskilled labour for use outside the actual zone of fighting, India could do muchmore than had been done, but so far the Secretary of State for india had not been approached on the subject. It was pointed out thaton the 22nd November the late War Committee formally invitedDepartments to furnish him with their demands for labour (war committee 90, Conclusion 13), but no answers had been received.The War Cabinet decided to investigate this question.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,January 1, 1917.(Initialled)D.

Ambassade. de France, Londres,Cher M. Balfour, le SOdecembre, 1916.JE recois ce soir tare! un telegramme dont M. Briand me prie de vouscommuniquer d&apos;urgence le sens, car il s&apos;agit d&quot;instructions a envoyer le plus totpossible aux Ministres allies a Athenes.Les&apos; informations qui sont recues de Grece a Paris, de quelque source qu&apos;eliesemanent, concordent a montrer que la situation empire rapidement, qu&apos;une partie dela population prend une attitude de plus en plus hostile aux Allies et que 1&apos;etat-majorgrec s&apos;est decide a nous resister.Nous avions demande a faire controler regulierement les passages de troupesgrecques a Corinthe non seulement au chemin de fer, mais aux bacs et aux routes.Cette demarche a ete ecartee.Nous voulions faire controler levacuation des troupes par des officiers fraiicais etbritanniques aux points cle depart en Thessalie et en Epire. Cette question n&apos;a pu etrereglee.Ainsi le Roi reste en etat cle gagner du temps et de nous tromper par des fauxsemblants pour preparer 1&apos;attaque de notre armee d&apos;Orient en combinaison avec lestroupes allemandes.M. Briand estime que, dans de pareilles conditions, notre devoir le plus strict nouscommande,de prendre les mesures inclispensables cle precaution sans nous engagerdans une action generale de guerre contre la Grece.Voici comment il resume la situation et ce quil vous propose :Le Roi Constantin a accepte la condition   posee   dans  notre ultimatum, lui -enjoignant d&apos;evacuer vers le Peioponnese les troupes grecques alors en Thessalie eten Epire.   Cet engagement il 1&apos;elude en retardant, ou en n&apos;effectuantquepartiellement1&apos;evacuation promise.PuisquTl refuse de nous laisser exercer sur les mouvements de ses troupes lasurveillance minutieuse que nous jugeons indispensable. M. Briand propose au gouvernement britannique de charger les Ministres a Athenes de mettre le Roi endemeure cle nous autoriser a organiser immecliatement ce controle aux points cle departet cVarrivee en Thessalie, en Epire et a Corinthe.Si le Roi Constantin opposait a notre requete une fin de non recevoir, ou avaitrecours a cles repocses equivoques, les Allies lui declareraient qu&apos;ils donnent auGeneral Sacrail la liberte cle prendre les mesures de securite qu&apos;il jugerait necessaires.M. Briand desirerait avoir une reponse aussi prompte cpie possible du gouvernement britannique au sujet de cette proposition. V7ous vous rappelez que, aucours cles dernieres conferences cle Downing Street, 1&apos;etablissement du cqntrole par clesofficiers francais et britanniques de 1&apos;armee d&apos;Orient en Thessalie et en Epire au mernetemps que par les attaches militaires a Corinthe avait ete juge indispensable. Lesdeux Gouvernements, et, en particulier, le Gouvernement britannique, comptent surles indications a fournir par ces controles pour determiner les instructions qu&apos;ilsdonneront ulterieurement au General Sarrail. Si ces controles ne peuvent etreorganises, comment les Gouvernements pourront-ils decider en connaissance de cause ?On risque, faute de renseignements, cle laisser le General Sarrail dans 1&apos;inaction aumoment Ou il devrait agir, et le Roi Constantin nous donne une nouvelle preuve de sesintentions a notre egarcl en s&apos;efforcant de .nous dissimuler la verite. II semble donequ&apos;il serait urgent de donner a nos Ministres 1&apos;ordre d&apos;effectuer immediatement la raiseen demeure suggeree par M. Briand et de les autoriser a lui dire, dans le cas ou. le Roin&apos;accederait pas a notre demande, que les Allies se considerent desormais commeautorises a laisser le General Sarrail libre de prendre les mesures necessaires a lasecurite de notre armee cfOrient.Cette demarche, a notre avis, pourrait produire son effet et, en tout cas, elleeclaircirait la situation.M. Briand m&apos;a prie d&apos;insister aupres de vous a fin d&apos;avoir une prompte reponse.Les instructions qu&apos;il propose d&apos;envoyer a Athenes ne prejudicieraient pas des mesuresqui seront probablement adoptees par la conference des Allies en Italie.Je me tiens a votre disposition pour aller vous parler de cette affaire demain,dimanche, a 1&apos;heure qui vous conviendra, et je vous prie, cher M. Balfour, de mecroire votre tres devoue serviteur,
Telegram from the French War Minister.December 31, L916.FROM information and telegrams received these last few days, it is certain thatthe Greek attitude becomes more and more threatening, and that the Government ofthe King is preparing to take immediate and extreme steps.If tbis threat should materialise, and if its taking effect should coincide with theGermano-Bulgarian operations against Monastir, the situation of the arrny of the Eastbecomes very critical. Attacked from north and south, and obliged to concentrate thebulk of its forces against the principal enemy, it will be difficult for this army todefend its left flank if fresh reinforcements are not sent. These reinforcements canonly come from England or Italy, as France has already done all she possibly can.It is not a question of declaring war on Greece, nor of entering the field against their. But we must be ready to reply to any hostile action which is quite evidentlygoing to be taken.And we must not allow the enemy to get ahead of us and take the initiative, orthe army at Salonica may find itself in a critical position which might seriouslycompromise the general military situation of the Allies.The important point, therefore, is to leave to the Commander-in-chief, who is responsible for the safety of his army, full latitude to take immediately all necessary steps to ensure this safety, such as securing bases, destroying communications, railway lines, bridges, &amp;c.Further, the Commander-in-chief must be enabled to prepare for any eventuality,and with this object in view he must be furnished with the reinforcements he sourgently requires.APPENDIX III.Telegram to the Self-Governing Dominions in regard to forthcoming Consultation.I WISH to make it clear that if your Prime Minister desires the presence at theWar Cabinet of colleagues, of whose special knowledge he wishes to avail himself, thelatter will be welcome, though of course the Prime Minister alone will be a member ofthe War Cabinet. Further, if your Ministers should desire to discuss other questionsof common interest not directly affecting the conduct of the war, or less appropriate for discussion at the War Cabinet, His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to arrangefacilities for conferring on any other questions awaiting decision between the ImperialGovernment and the Dominions, although it may not be possible for the PrimeMinister to preside./
