The Arab revolt . 1. THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that theTurks were retiring on Medina, and that the Medina Railway hadbeen cut for three weeks.Submarines. 2. The Secretary informed the War Cabinet, that in future the casulties from submarines would not be reproduced in the Minutes,as he had arranged with the Admiralty to circulate the informationdaily to the members of the War Cabinet.The War Cabinet requested the First Sea Lord to communicate this information also to those members of the Ministrywho receive complete hies of War Cabinet Minutes,namely : The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.The Permanent Under-Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs.The Secretary of State for the Colonies.The Secretary of State for India..    -    -: :   . . The Secretary of State for War.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff.The Director of Military Operations.The Secretary of State for Home Affairs.The President of the Board of Trade.The Minister of Blockade.3. The First Sea Lord reported several actions with submarines,including some which indicated the possibility of successful results.The French 4. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff read to the WarRailways. * Cabinet, a telegram from Sir Douglas Haig (Appendix I) on therailway situation in France. Sir William Robertson stated that hewas of opinion that Sir Douglas Haig would not have proposed aConference if, firstly, he had known that a despatch on the- &quot; subject was about to be sent to the French Government (WarCabinet, 59, Minute 9), and, secondly, if he had not felt that theWar Cabinet instructions to him of the 17th January, 1917, so tiedhis hands that he could not appropriately discuss the matter withGeneral Nivelle. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff did not recommend that a Conference should be held at this stage, but that sir Douglas Haig should discuss the matter fidly with General Nivelle at the end of the week, and report further on the subject.The War Cabinet approved the recommendation of the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff, &apos; and requested him, intelegraphing this view of the War Cabinet to theCommander-in-Chief of the British Expeditionary Force,to inform him that they fully sympathised with him withregard to the difficulties with which he is faced in thismatter, and are quite prepared to have a Conference asproposed if he cannot come to an agreement with General Nivelle.5. The War Cabinet approved, with amendments, the draft letter (Appendix II) to the French Government, carrying out thedecision of the previous day (War Cabinet, 64, Minute 6), and decided that a copy of their decision (War Cabinet, 36, Minute 4),arrived at on the 17th January, 1917, should be communicated atthe same time.   &apos;Japan andShantung.6. At the instance of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,the War Cabinet again considered the question of the Japaneseclaim to Shantung, with special reference to their decision on the
12th February (War Cabinet, 63, Minute 11) to invite Japan, inreturn for an assurance of our support to .their claim to Shantung,to give a corresponding assurance of support, in the eventual peace settlement, not only to our claims to the German islands South ofthe Equator, but also &quot; in our general policy elsewhere.&quot;The AVar Cabinet (Lord Curzon dissenting) decided that-It would be inexpedient and unfair to our Allies to invite japan to give so wide an assurance, and that the Foreign office should omit from their communication to Japan the words in italics.The Dardanelles 7. In order to avoid the risk of giving valuable information to commission. the enemy, the AVar Cabinet decided that:  &apos;The Report of the Dardanelles Commission should, before publication, be examined in the Foreign Office, Admiralty,War Office, and by the Members and Secretary of the AVarCabinet. The Secretary of State for Home Affairs under-took to circulate copies accordingly.Government 8. The AVar Cabinet approved the project)proposals of the PresidentControl of Coal- of the Board of Trade contained in his Memorandum dated the fields. 13th February, l&apos;.)17 (Appendix III), for taking control of the coal-mines and lor the administrative arrangements for exercising this control.   (War Cabinet, 37, Minute 8.)Railway Trucks.9. The President of the Board of Trade said that his Depart-ment had already the requisite power for controlling railway trucks,including those belonging to the coal-owners, and had in handarrangements for their economical use. The AVar Cabinet laid stress on the development of these arrangements.Recruiting of miners.10. The AVar Cabinet decided that AA7ith a view to the avoidance of delay in releasing the 20,000miners, approved by them on the 19th January, 1917(War Cabinet, 39, Minute 1 (c)), the machinery for the recruitment of miners should remain with the Home Officepending the complete organisation of the Coal ControllersDepartment under the Board of Trade.The Controller ofCoal-mines.11. The War Cabinet approved the appointment, as controller of Coal-mines, of Air. Guy Calthrop, the General Manager of theLondon and North-western Railway.The Regulation of domestic CoalConsumption. ..12. The AVar Cabinet invited the President of the Board ofTrade to direct the attention of the Controller of Coal-mines, at,anearly date, to the need for a more economical use of coal in domestic consumption.Restriction of 13. The AVar Cabinet authorised the Secretary of State forLiquor Traffic. Home  Affairs to  state in the Parliamentary Debate that, withreference to the announcement  made by the Food Controller,
they were considering the desirability of greater restrictions on theground of national safety, and also that they were keeping thequestion of the nationalisation of the liquor traffic before them.The Church of 14. The War Cabinet authorised the Secretary of State for england and Home Affairs to inform the Archbishop of Canterbury that thei a ion a . ei Government would support the enactment of any legislation as maybe found to be necessary for curtailing Church services and making-other arrangements for supporting the National Service Campaign.&quot;lord&quot; Factory 15. The Minister of Munitions reported that an offer had beenin Ireland. received from Mr. Henry Ford, of the United States of America, to erect, with Irish labour, a factory near Cork for the production ofagricultural tractors, who was prepared to bring the necessary machinery and materials from America, and to obtain the requisitelabour from the Irish people for constructing the tractors. TheMinister of Munitions stated that our manufacturers of agriculturaltractors were at present fully employed in the manufacture ofmunitions, and that, if the proposal of Mr. Ford was approvedby the War Cabinet, steps would have to be taken to regulate thewages, as a large number of Irish labourers were now employedin munition works in England.He further stated that delivery of these tractors might beanticipated towards the end of 1917, and that the cost would beabout .150Z. a machine, as against the present price of 350Z.With regard to the provision of material, it was pointed outby the Minister of Munitions that a large quantity would not berequired, and that steps could be taken to regulate the supply sothat any English firms that desired to compete would not be placed at a disadvantage in this respect.The President of the Board of Trade informed the War Cabinetthat the general question of the erection of a Ford establishment inthe United Kingdom had arisen some time ago, and Mr. Ford wasthen informed by the Minister of Munitions that though his proposalto start a motor-car industry at Southampton could not be approved,there was no objection to one being created in Ireland.The President of the Board of Trade understood that it was intended that the industry was to be built up with the ultimateobject of meeting the requirements of depots of assembly for Fordmotor products, to be established in different places on the Continent,motor cars and motor traction generally, and expressed the viewthat if permission was now withheld, Mr. Ford would build hisfactory in France oi elsewhere on the Continent, to the detriment of irish industry and of the employment of Irish labour.The President of the Board of Agriculture pointed out that ifthe proposal was approved it would be very hard on tractormanufacturers in this country, owing to their not being in aposition to compete, as they were fully occupied in the manufactureof munitions ; one firm, he was informed, was ready to make now a suitable tractor and place it on the market at a price of about1001. He said it was very desirable to have a sufficient. supply oftractors available for the Spring of 1918.The Chief Secretary for Ireland informed the War Cabinet thatthere was a great demand for these tractors in Ireland ; that 500could easily be absorbed, but that there were only 50 in view, andthat they were very suitable for Irish soil. He further stated thatthe people of Ireland were fully aware of the offer, were strongly infavour of it, and that the matter had been discussed between theIrish Local Government Board and the Cork City Council, and a siteselected. He understood that Mr. Ford was prepared to spend400,000Z. on the erection of the buildings, to employ at once 2,000
i v[1365-65]people at a minimum wage of Is. an hour, and ultimately have 10,000employees in this factory. The Chief Secretary for Ireland appre-ciated the labour problems involved, but hoped it would be possibleto overcome them. He added that legislative sanction was requiredfor the transfer of the site selected, and that this would enable theGovernment to impose such conditions as they thought fit. VThe War Cabinet considered the case at length from the pointof view of : (a.) Supply of material ;(6.) The importance of creating industries in Ireland and theemployment of Irish labour, and its development as anational asset;(c.) The supply of machinery for agricultural purposes.(d.) The question of fairness to firms that have been corn-mandeered for war purposes.and decided that (1.) Permission should be given to Mr. Ford to erect a factory,subject to the condition that he was to confine his manu-factures during the war to agricultural machinery, andthat he should import his own plant and material, exceptso far as sanctioned by the Minister of Munitions, andalso comply Avith the directions of the latter as to conditions of employment and rates of wages.(2.) Any British agricultural machinery firms who were makingmunitions and were capable and desirous of making such machinery, should be released from munition work andallowed to devote their attention to the production ofagricultural machinery, being at the same time givenfacilities for acquiring materials for their manufacture.(Initialled) D.

Paraphrase of a Telegram from Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig to the Chief of theImperial General Staff, dated February 14, 1917.THE railway situation shows no improvement, and recent communications fromthe French are highly unsatisfactory.Even supposing drastic curtailment of civil traffic and other means suggested are adopted immediately and whole-heartedly by the French, the Director-General ofTransport, on latest information, advises a great unlikelihood of early improvement.This must have, in my opinion, serious influence on Cabinet&apos;s decision fixing elate of operations. I consider a Conference should be held forthwith by the heads of theBritish and French Governments and Nivelle and myself. On Friday and Saturday ofthis week Nivelle will be with me, and a Conference is therefore suggested for thisweek-end at. Boulogne or Dover.The Director-General of Transport and the Chief of the General Staff will leave to-day for London to explain the situation. In present circumstances, if the operations are carried out on dates proposed, they will probably lead to very heavy losses withinadequate results.APPENDIX II.French Railways.Amendmentmade byWaxCabinet.Copy of a Letter from Foreign Office to British Ambassador in France.(No. .108.   Confidential.)My Lord, Foreign Offi.ce, February 14, 1917.I AM desired by His Majesty&apos;s Government to forward, for transmission to theGovernment of the French Republic, the enclosed Memorandum on the railway situation in the zone of the British armies in France.While His Majesty&apos;s Government are fully sensible of the efforts made to cope with the increasing demands of the British armies as they have grown in strength,they ca-not but regret that the probability of a breakdown on the Nord system wasnot earlier recognised by the French Headquarters, more especially in view of the factthat a failure in the carrying capacity of the lines serving the British zone would inevitably result in delaying operations, not merely until the leeway had been made up, but also until an adequate service was assured.It will be remembered that, at the Conference held in London on the 15th and16th January last, attended by Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig and General Nivelle,the War Cabinet agreed to a great extension of the British front, and to adopt the plan of operations proposed by General Nivelle, notwithstanding that certain forcibleobjections to this course were placed before them by the British Commander and theChief of the Imperial General Staff. further, on the following day, the 17th January, the War Cabinet decided &quot;thatthe Chief of the Imperial General Staff should record, in the form of a specialinstruction to Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, the importance, which they attach tothe utmost despatch in carrying out, both in the letter and in the spirit, the agreement made with General Nivelle on the 16th January, .1917, in order that the british expeditionary Force may be able to carry out its share of the operations at the datelaid down in the aforesaid agreement, or even before that date, with the forces available at the moment, if the weather and other conditions make the operationspossible and advisable. It should be also noted that on no account must the french have to wait for us owing to our arrangements not being complete. Further, it was tobe borne in mind that, as the Germans might attack before we do, we, by makingevery effort to advance our arrangements, should be assisting to stultify any effort oftheirs.&quot;
His Majesty&apos;s Government accordingly feel that they have incurred a heavyresponsibility, and they cannot but express their disappointment at the present unsatisfactory situation in regard to the railways, which, from a telegram received to-day from Sir Douglas Haig, has as yet undergone no improvement. They hope,therefore, that the French Government will give their earnest attention to the measures recommended in paragraph S and the last sentence of paragraph 12 of theMemorandum, and wall take such other measures as may be deemed essential rapidly toimprove matters.I am to add that, while His 3.iajesty&apos;s Government will continue to give allassistance they can, they desire that it may be clearly understood that, unless timelyprovision of adequate railway facilities is assured, they cannot guarantee to carry outthe plan of operations upon which General Nivelle laid so much stress at the london conference, and which was also strongly insisted on by M. Doumergue and AdmiralLacaze in their recent visit to London.1 have to request your Lordship to make an urgent communication to thePresident of the Council in the above sense, leaving with his Excellency a copy of this despatch.I am, &amp;c.(Signed)   .      HARDINGE OF PEXSHURST.APPENDIX III.Control of Coal Mines.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.THE powers at present exercisablc, or exercised, with regard to coal appear to beas follows :  Under Defence of the Realm Regulation 9 (G), the Board of Trade have power totake possession of any coal mines where it appears to them expedient &quot; for securingthe public safety and the defence of the realm.&quot; So far, this power has only been exercised in relation to the South Wales coalfield.It is proposed to apply the Regulation to all coal mines in Great Britain andIreland. Owing to the special circumstances of the Irish mines, it will probably benecessary to deal with Ireland separately. It may be mentioned that the Price of Coal(Limitation) Act does not apply to coal raised in Ireland.Where the Regulation has been applied to any mine, the owner, agent, or manageris bound to &quot; comply with the directions of the Board of Trade as to the management and user of the mine.&quot; This appears to give the Board of Trade complete power with regard to mining management (except for the requirements of The Coal mines act, 1911, which are expressly saved).Under Defence of the Realm Regulation 2 (D), the Admiralty or Army Council,or the Minister of Munitions, or any person authorised by them (that is, inpractice, the Secretaries of the Central Coal and Coke Supplies Committee), havepower to give &quot;directions as to the priority to be given in the execution of orders orcontracts for the supply of coal and coke.......in accordance with their national importance.It is understood that in practice this regulation has been interpreted as givingpractically complete power to control the distribution of the output of a mine, and nofurther power may be necessary.Under Defence of the Realm Regulation No. 2 (JJ), the Board of Trade mayexercise all the powers of the Food Controller under previous regulations as respectsany necessary article of commerce (other than food) &quot; for the purpose of encouragingor maintaining the supply of any such article.&quot;These powers are very comprehensive, including, for instance, the regulationof &quot; the production, manufacture, treatment, use, consumption, transport, storage,distribution, supply,&quot; &amp;c, of any article, the fixing of maximum or minimum prices,requiring returns as to stock, requisitioning stocks, &amp;c, and may be exercised either generally or in special cases. It appears therefore that, subject to the limiting words&quot;for the purpose of encouraging or maintaining the supply of any such article,&quot; there
ois ample power to control the distribution and consumption of coal so far as may bethought necessary.As regards the control at present exercised, the Coal Mining organisation committee, which has dealt since the commencement of the war with all questions relating to the maintenance of the output of coal, has not so far exercised anycompulsory powers. As soon, however, as control is assumed of any mine it will bepossible to- enforce their recommendations. It would seem desirable that thisCommittee should in future act under the Coal Controller, and it is understood that theHome Office have no objection. Questions relating to the recruiting of miners fall within the purview of the Home Office, but in practice have largely been referred tothis Committee, and should now be dealt with by the Coal Controller.As regards export, complete control is exercised by the Coal Exports Committee,both as regards the quantity of coal exported and the suitability of the consignor orconsignee. This control has not so far extended to questions of price, but there is nothing to prevent this.There is no specific power to control the shipment of coal as bunkers in thecoastwise trade, and though there is an indirect power to control foreign bunkers, ithas not so far been exercised in the case of British ships.As regards inland distribution, the Central Coal and Coke Supplies Committeeand the District Committees acting under them have, it is understood, for the mostpart exercised their functions without specific authority, but, where necessary, orders under the Defence of the Realm Regulation, No. 2 (D), have been issued.The price of coal for inland consumption at the pit&apos;s mouth (except in Ireland) is controlled by the Price of Coal (Limitation) Act. Retail prices have so far only beencontrolled by voluntary agreements.It is proposed that for the immediate present the above-named Committees shouldcontinue their functions for the general purposes of the Coal Controllers administrationuntil he has had some experience to guide him, and, in addition for dealing with labour questions, it will probably be proposed that an Advisory Committee should beset up consisting of representatives both of the coal owners and the miners; but whether this will be done by the absorption of the present Committees must remainover for further consideration.For the present it is not proposed to interfere with the operations of theCommittees for the supply of coal to France and Italy.The Control might be in respect of :  (1.) Output of mines (including supply of labour and necessary materials).(2.) Conditions of employment other than health and safety.(3.) Distribution.(4.) Prices.(5.) Export.(6.) Consumption of coal.The definite sanction of the Government is desired to these questions being placedwithin control of the Coal Controller.February 13, 1917.
