THE War Cabinet confirmed the provisional approval givenby the Prime Minister, at a Meeting held earlier in the afternoon,to the following authority to the Food Controller : That 200,000 tons of sulphate of ammonia be made availablefor farmers at 16Z. per ton delivered free of carriage atconsignees&apos; railway stations.The Shipping Con-troller&apos;s Powers.*2. The War Cabinet had under consideration certain memoranda by the Admiralty and the Shipping Controller (Appendix I).&apos;The Shipping Controller asked the War Cabinet for fullerpowers over the British mercantile marine In the past, requests for tonnage from the various Government Departments and fromthe Allies have come to the Admiralty Director of Transports, whoThe discussion of this question was commenced at Meeting 59.
The Order of the 3. The War Cabinet considered the proposal to institute a new british Empire.        Order of the British Empire as a recognition of services rendered inconnection with the war, by men and women, at home and; abroad,has dealt with them after reference, during the past year, to theShipping Control Committee.The Shipping Controller now requested that the TransportDepartment should be placed under his control, and that he should deal out tonnage as required. By this arrangement the Controllerdid not propose that he should intervene with regard to the employ-ment of the vessels allocated to the service of the Navy, of whichthere appeared at present to be between 400 and 500 steamers,except that he should have liberty to enquire into the manner ofemployment, and, if necessary, make representations, but that heshould decide upon any further requests for tonnage that may bemade by the Admiralty, War Office,, and other GovernmentDepartments.The First Lord said that he could not agree to the suggestionthat the Transport Department should be placed under theShipping Controller, having regard to the fact tbat the work has tobe carried out under secret Admiralty codes and a world-wide Navalorganisation.The Fourth Sea Lord pointed out that all the Senior naval officers and Transport Officers were under the orders of the Boardof Admiralty, and he asked how it would be possible for them toreceive orders from the Shipping Controller.The Shipping Controller said that there need be no difficulty asto this, because the Director of Transports would continue, as atpresent; to issue instructions to the Transport Officers. TheDirector would, in fact, act in a dual capacity, and be responsible tothe two Departments.The Shipping Controllers proposals, contained in Memorandum(D), do not, therefore, alter the existing dual responsibility of theDirector of Transports, which, in turn, merely reflect the dualcharacter of the functions of the mercantile marine in war-time.After some discussion, it was decided, before proceeding further,that Lord Curzon should be asked to obtain the views of theDirector of Transports and the Shipping Control Committeeon the question of the administrative practicability of theShipping Controller^ proposals.(The   discussion of this  question  was resumed at the .afternoon Meeting.)Lord Curzon reported that the Director of Transports did not anticipate any difficulty or friction arising out of his dualresponsibility, but, if it would secure the acquiescence of theAdmiralty in the proposals, he thought arrangements might be made whereby the portion of his administrative staff dealing wdth Navaland Military shipping should remain on the books of the Admiralty.Lord Curzon further stated that the representatives of theShipping Control Committee, whom he had seen, were in favour ofthe change proposed in Memorandum (D).The First Lord, First Sea Lord, and Fourth Sea Lord objected to the establishment of a system, that created a dual responsibility.The War Cabinet decided that The proposals set forth in Memorandum (D) should beadopted, but that, if the Admiralty desire, the portion ofthe administrative staff of the Director of Transports,dealing with Naval and Military shipping, should remain on the books of the Admiralty.

Powers of the Shipping Controller.(A.)Memorandum by the Shipping Controller.THE statutory duty of the Shipping Controller is &quot; to control and regulate anyshipping available for the needs of the country in such a manner as to make the best use thereof, having regard to the circumstances of the time, and to take such steps ashe thinks best for providing and maintaining an efficient supply of shipping.&quot; Forthese purposes he is to have, for the duration of the war, and a period not exceedingtwelve months thereafter, &quot; such powers or duties of any Government Department orauthority, whether conferred by statute or otherwise, as His Majesty may by Order inCouncil transfer to him, or authorise him to exercise or to perform concurrently or inconsultation with the Government Department or authority concerned, and also such further powers as may be conferred upon, him by regulations under the Defence of the realm Consolidation Act.&quot;1. Merchant Shipbuilding.It is suggested that the Shipping Controller should have power (1.) To determine the priority of the construction of (a.) Merchant ships, including tugs and other craft already laid down.(b:) Merchant ships, including tugs and other craft about to be laid down.(2.) To build merchant ships.(3.) To sell the ships he builds and to purchase merchant ships on behalf ofthe Crown.(4.) In conjunction with the Admiralty, to deal with all questions of labour in shipbuilding yards and marine engine works.Exercise of Functions at present assigned to the Director of Transports.Attention is called to the present anomalous position of the TransportDepartment. Tbe Director of Transports is an Admiralty officer responsible solely tothe Board of Admiralty. His Department, however, in practice regulates thedistribution of merchant shipping, not merely for Admiralty service, but also underrequisition for War Officer, Wheat Commission, and other Government services. Solong as all Government demands could be met in full, or subject only to minoradjustment, this arrangement might work smoothly ; but, so soon as cutting down of requirements in oue direction or another becomes necessary, difficulties are bound to arise, and the Director of Transports may find himself involved in a conflict of authority. It is believed that this point has now been reached. The pressure uponavailable tonnage is now such that it is necessary to weigh against each other theneeds of the various Departments, including the Admiralty, and to determine in whichdirection priority should be given.Under the. terms of the Act above quoted, this is clearly a responsibility of theShipping Controller, subject of course to the overriding powers of the War Council.In practice the conclusions of the Controller must be carried into effect through theexisting machinery of requisition, &amp;c. This machinery is comprised in the Departmentof the Director of Transports, and so long as the relation of the Director to the Boardof Admiralty remains as it is at present, the Shipping Controller lacks the means of bringing about fair and effective co-ordination of the needs of the various Departments,since the Director of Transports is in a position to carry out the policy of the Controlleronly so far as it may coincide with that of the Board of Admiralty. Further, so faras the Controller may desire to seek advice and guidance from the Director of Transportsand Ins technical staff, he is necessarily hampered by the consideration that theDirector is not a free agent in matters affecting Admiralty policy. It is suggestedthat the remedy for this state of things is to transfer the Director and his staff fromthe jurisdiction of the Admiralty and bring him under that of the Shipping Controller.
3. Financial and Accounting Responsibilities of Controller.It appears that the financial and accounting work in connection with vesselsrequisitioned by the Transport Department for Government service is at present carriedout partly by the finance branch of the Transport Department and partly by theAccountant-General of the Admiralty.The transfer of functions above suggested would therefore bring under thejurisdiction of the Shipping Controller part only of the financial and accounting workconsequent upon the operation of the Transport Department, and unless further steps were taken functions exactly similar in character would continue to be exercised by theAdmiralty in respect of one section of the work. it is suggested that even at thepresent time, white the whole of the work of the Transport Department is under thecontrol of the Board of Admiralty there is no logical justification for this separation,which cannot fail in practice to lead to differences of treatment of similar problemsby the two Departments concerned and to give rise to confusion. If, and when, the suggested transfer of the work of the Transport Department takes effect, the divisions of accounting and financial responsibility will become still more undefensible.It is therefore suggested that the Shipping Controller should be made solely responsible for dealing with claims from shipowners in respect of requisitioned vessels and with transport expenditure generally.4. Port and Transit Facilities.It is clear from the statutory definition of the Controllers functions that his responsibility must extend to any measures that may be needed to obviate delay in the handling of vessels in port.It is suggested, therefore, that the reference of the Port and Transit ExecutiveCommittee should be transferred from the Prime Minister, by whom the committee wasappointed, to the Shipping Controller.5. Licensing of Voyages.Similarly, the control by means of the licensing system of British ships not underrequisition must be brought within the jurisdiction of the Shipping Controller. TheShip Licensing Committee, which was set up by the Board of Trade, and is at presentresponsible to that Department, should in future be responsible to the ShippingController.Au attempt has been made above to classify under separate headings the moreimportant of the functions to be exercised by the Shipping Controller. There remain a number of miscellaneous matters which it is difficult to classify in this way, but which must in some form or another come before the Controller in the exercise of his duty of maintaining a general oversight over the whole mercantile marine. Suchmatters include the regulation of the chartering of neutral vessels, enquiry into theuse made of vessels assigned to Government service, consideration of questions relating to shipowners&apos; profits,&apos; co-operation with the Board of Trade in the administra-tion of the Merchant Shipping Acts (as to personnel, loadline. &amp;c), consideration of questions affecting insurance of ships against war risks, the requisitioning of insulatedspace on liners, and so forth.January 12, 1917.(B.)Memorandum by the Admiralty.1. The Controller of Shipping to be head of an office on ordinary administrativelines with an administrative staff responsible to him, the Controller himself beingpresumably in the same relation to the supreme authority in the Government as otherHeads of Government Departments under the new regime.2. This would somewhat change the character of the Shipping,Control Committee,whose members under this proposal would presumably be advisers to the Controller.[1865-60] C
3. It is important that the work of the Controller and that of the Admiraltyshoidd be linked together, and for this purpose I would propose the Director of transports as the link by altering his title to &quot; Director of Transports and Shipping.&quot;4. Generally speaking, the Transport Department through its Director, would beresponsible to, and receive orders from, the Board of Admiralty as regards distinctlynaval and military work, and would also look to the Controller for instructions asregards commercial work.5. Some arrangement would have to be made for consultation in case of conflict between the Controller and the Board of Admiralty, while each would of course retain the right to go to the War Cabinet if agreement proved impossible. It would hewell, however, to reduce the possibility of cases of conflict to a minimum by as closeas possible a definition of authority.6. The two main questions that require consideration in this connection are : (a.) Supply of tonnage, and(6.) Man encouragement .With regard to (a) it might be arranged, that the Controller was responsiblefor the business of allotting all tonnage, not only to the Allies, but to the different departments in this couutry, including the War Office and the Admiralty. Thiswould mean that he would be responsible for making up a programme showdng theextent, if any, to which it was impracticable to meet all requirements, and indicatingafter consultation with the Departments concerned where the reduction should bemade. This would not: of course prevent the Board of Admiralty going to theCabinet with regard to any proposed reduction of vessels on their service, but would only put the Admiralty in a similar position in this respect to, say, the Ministry ofMunitions under the present system.With regard to (6), the Controller would be responsible for management of vessels on commercial services, and, with regard to vessels on naval and military services,might be given full power to obtain information as to the manner in which the vessels were being managed and to make representations to the Board of Admiralty and after-wards, if necessary, to the Cabinet; but the immediate responsibility for management of vessels on these latter services would remain with the Director of Transports underthe Board of Admiralty.7. The difficulties of dual responsibility are of course obvious, but they are inherent in the dual character of the functions of the Mercantile Marine in war time,and any other alternative would perhaps present not less but more serious sources of friction.8. Any other work which is outside the present scope of the Transport Department(e.g., commercial congestion of ports, mercantile shipbuilding,&quot;ship licensing, chartering of neutrals, &amp;c.) which the Controller might desire to bring within his sphere of authority would easily fall into the above organisation.9. One great advantage of the above proposal is that it solves the difficulty ofgiving instructions to transport officers who are naval officers and number some 500,and also the S.N.O.&apos;s who are acting as Superintending Transport Officers. The dailywork of all the present branches of the Transport Department (including commercialbranch) involves sending telegraphic and written instructions to these officers. Nodifficulty arises so long as these are sent in the name of the Director of Transports, whois a servant of the Board of Admiralty, but the position would be different if they were sent by an officer having no official connection with the Admiralty.,(C)Further Memorandum by Controller.The Memorandum marked (B) giving in detail the suggestions of the FourthSea Lord would seem to provide an acceptable basis of compromise subject to a fewminor adjustments.The Shipping Controller had never contemplated an arrangement which wouldin practice render the Admiralty dependent on another Department for the dischargeof any responsibilities with which it is properly charged. The proposals he putforward were confined to the broad question of principle, and he readily recognises that adjustments in detail are necessary as a guarantee of the efficient carrying out ofAdmiralty policy in the future as heretofore.
(D.)Memorandum by Sir Joseph Maclay.On the 12th January the Shipping Controller forwarded to the First Lord of theAdmiralty a Memorandum in which it was proposed inter alia that the whole of thestaff and equipment of the Transport Department should be transferred fromthe jurisdiction of the Board of Admiralty to that of the Shipping Controller. A copyof this Memorandum is enclosed, marked (A). It contains the arguments for theController^ proposal.In reply, a communication was received from the Admiralty containing theoutlines of a suggested organisation which appeared to the Controller to afford areasonable basis of compromise. The relative part of this Memorandum is alsoenclosed, marked (B).The Controller then prepared and forwarded to the Admiralty a further memorandum, marked (Cj.From subsequent communications and discussions it appears that, so far as concerns the main question of the demarcation of the respective spheres of authority ofthe Board of Admiralty and the Controller, there should lie little difficulty in arriving at a satisfactory settlement by consent on the following broad lines :  (a.) The Controller to be the authority responsible for the allocation of mercantiletonnage to all services and for the management of requisitioned vesselsexcept as regards essentially naval work, the term &quot;naval&quot; beinginterpreted as including the transport of troops and such military service as form an integral part of joint naval and military policy.Following the lines of the Admiralty Memorandum above referred to andaccepting the general principle there indicated, the Controller now submits theproposals set out below : 1. The Controller of Shipping to be head of an office on ordinary departmentallines with an administrative and executive staff responsible to him, theController himself being in the same relation to the supreme authority inthe Government as other heads of Departments under the new regime.2. The Controller to be recognised as the supreme authority in all matters relating to the mercantile marine, except as regards ships allotted to naval service, so long as they remain in such service.3. The Director of Transports, with the title Director of Transports and shipping, to be the connecting link between Departments, and thoughunder the Controller to be directly responsible to and receive orders fromthe Board of Admiralty as regards distinctly naval work.4. The Controller to have at all times the right to investigate the use made of anyunit of the mercantile marine howsoever employed, and to make such representations with regard thereto as he may think fit. In case of conflict between the Controller and the Board of Admiralty or any other Depart-ment, each would of course retain the right to go to the War Cabinet if agreement proved impossible.5. While the Controller would be responsible for the business of allotting tonnageso far as available, this would not prevent the Board of Admiralty or anyother Department concerned going to the Cabinet with regard to anyrefusal of tonnage.6. Instructions to Transport Officers to be sent as heretofore by the Director ofTransport and Shipping in virtue of his responsibility to the Board ofAdmiralty.7. LTnestablished staff in the Transport Department to be transferred to theController of Shipping. Established staff to be lent to the Controller, andto remain on Admiralty books in accordance with general service arrange-ments, no action to be taken effecting the permanent status of any establishedofficer without consent of the Admiralty.8. The Controller to be responsible for all financial and accounting workconsequent upon the operations of the Transport Department.January 22, 1917.
(6.) The Board of Admiralty, within its sphere of authority as so defined, to havethe right to give orders direct to the Director.of Transports, who would thus form the connecting link between the Departments.On the further question, however, of the position which the Transport department would occupy under such an arrangement, there is a sharp conflict of view between theController and the Admiralty. Having regard to the objects with which the Ministryof Shipping was established, the Controller holds it to be essential that the TransportDepartment should be transferred as a whole, subject only to the understandingdescribed above as to tbe dual responsibility of the Director of Transports and tocertain minor reservations as to naval staff, &amp;c.The Admiralty, on the other hand, contemplates an actual physical separation ofthe Transport Department under the Director into an Admiralty side and a ShippingController^ side. This seems to the Controller quite impracticable. The separationcould not, in fact, be made complete, and so far as it was carried out could not fail,in his opinion, to lead to loss of efficiency. The Transport Department has beenmanaged in the past as a single administrative unit, and under whatever authority itmay he placed the nature of the work and. the complete interdependence of the variousconstituent branches make it essential that it should so remain.It is true that under the Controllers proposal the Director of Transports will, beresponsible to two Departments. But though the difficulty of dual control is obvious,it is inherent (as, indeed, the Admiralty Memorandum points out) in the dual characterof the functions of the mercantile marine in war time. The Admiralty proposal, so farfrom avoiding the difficulty, would intensify it, as it would involve placing notonly the Director, but a number of other officers in the same position of dividedresponsibility.In consequence of the fundamental difference of opinion above described, theController, with the concurrence of the First Lord, submits the point at issue forthe decision of the War Cabinet.January 30, 1917.o
