Major the Hon. N. S. Lytton, a specially deputed member ofDouglas Haig&apos;s Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig&apos;s Staff, attended the War CabinetAlleged Interview. an(j g-ave a f n\\ acc0unt of one of the interviews given by Sir douglas haig to certain French journalists. From Major Lytton&apos;s accountit was clear that the French reports had considerably embroideredthe actual conversation which took place, with the result that thereports, though based on Sir Douglas Haig&apos;s actual statements, wereincorrect in detail, and gave a false general impression.The description of the interviews, however, were censored and passed at General Headquarters in France, but were not seen by Sir Douglas Haig himself. Major Lytton stated that the interview had had an excellent effect on French public opinion.
The Dardanelles ^&quot; (-&apos;a^)met authorised the Secretary to communicateCommission *Q ^e Dardanelles Commission the decisions of the DardanellesCommittee and of the late War Committee, so far as these relate tothe present Enquiry (Appendix I) (War Cabinet, 47, Minute 22).Educational 10. The War Cabinet had under consideration the proposals ofDevelopment and the President of the Board of Education, contained in aReform. Memorandum of  &quot; Proposals for Immediate Action,&quot; dated the2nd February, 1917, and &quot; General Proposals,&quot; dated the5th February, 1917.Mr. Fisher stated that elementary teachers were miserably paid,and that a discontented teaching class was a social danger. Further,as in the case of all fixed incomes, the war had greatly diminishedthe purchasing power of the teachers&apos; low salaries. Before the war,the wastage of teachers was 9,000 per annum, and this was being-repaired only to the extent of 0,900. To meet such a serious shortage after the war, it was essential to increase the attractions ofthe profession now. if it -&quot;were objected that local authorities wouldpress Parliament for similar Treasury grants for housing,sanitation, &amp;c, the reply would be that such measures involved theuse of labour, whereas the educational proposals did not. Further,the present proposals did not increase the rates, but the taxes, andthe burden was readjusted so as to offer a direct inducement tolocal Education Authorities to improve teachers&apos; salaries wheresalary expenditure is low, and to recognise the -liberality of theauthorities where salary expenditure is high. Mr. Fisher pointedout that it was not intended, during the War, to abolish half-time or to raise the elementary school age. It was desirable, however to obtain statutory recognition of the principle of ContinuedEducation, although it would take perhaps fifteen years to give full effect to the principle.The War Cabinet approved generally the proposals set forth inthe Memoranda, including- the financial proposals outlined in the Memorandum of the 2nd February, 1917, &quot; Educa-tional Development,&quot; and authorised the President of theBoard of Education to proceed with legislation : (a.) To empower  local  Educational authorities  toprovide Nursery Schools ;(6.) To establish a system of pensions for teachers in: Secondary and Technical Schools.The War Cabinet also agreed that the President should take into consultation some of the leading business men ofthe country in regard to the initiation of a system of compulsory day continuation classes for young persons.The Wax- Cabinet decided that The reply in Parliament to questions on this subject should bein the following sense : &quot; Sir Douglas Haig has from time to time seenvarious influential gentlemen, both journalists and others,of Allied and Neutral countries. On this occasion hemet several important French journalists, with whom hehad a frank conversation, in which he gave them his general views on the situation. In the present instance,proofs of the interview were sent to General Head-quarters, but, owing to the action of a subordinate, theywere not submitted to Sir Douglas Haig himself.&quot;
11. The Chief Secretary for Ireland stated that the ordinarytriennial period for holding elections of members of the County and rural District Councils and Boards of Guardians in Ireland would occur at the beginning of next June. The latest suspensory enact-ment (&quot; Parliament and Local Elections Act, 1916&quot;) does notpostpone them.   The War Cabinet decided that--The necessary steps should be taken to postpone the holding ofthe elections, on lines similar to those taken in England.12. The Minister of Blockade laid before the War Cabinetalternative drafts (Appendix II) amending the draft Order inCouncil approved by the War Cabinet on the 8th February, 1917(War Cabinet, 57, Minute 7 and Appendix I). He explained thatthe Lord Chancellor had taken exception to the original draft. Thefirst alternative had been prepared by the Minister of Blockade, andthe second by the Lord Chancellor.The War Cabinet approved the first alternative draft, whichcarries out their original decision, and authorised theMinister of Blockade to take the necessary action to giveeffect to this decision.13. The War Cabinet approved generally the proposals inregard to the organisation and machinery of a Propaganda Depart-ment, outlined in a Memorandum, dated the 3rd February, 1917,prepared by Mr. John Buchan, and circulated to the War Cabinetin accordance with their decision of the 9th February (War Cabinet,60, Minute 4), subject to the following variations: (a.) The headcpuarters of the Department should be housed atthe Foreign Office, on the analogy of the Ministry of blockade.(b.) The new Department to be termed &quot; Department ofInformation.&quot;(Initialled)      D. LI. G.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,February 20, 1917.
The Dardanelles Commission.Note by the Secretary.I ENCLOSE a letter I have received from the Secretary of the dardanelles commission, covering a letter addressed to him by the Chairman of the Commission.I saw Mr. Mears on Saturday afternoon and explained to him that,the decision ofthe War Cabinet not to allow the Secretary&apos;s notes of the Meetings of the DardanellesCommittee to be furnished to the Commission must be accepted as final, and I suggested to him in conversation that the Commission could really get all the evidencethey required by hearing the evidence of those members of the Government of that day, who were also members of the Dardanelles Committee. He begged me, however,to lay Sir William Pickford&apos;s letter before the War Cabinet.I would suggest, for the consideration of the War Cabinet, that I might beauthorised to communicate, not the detailed Secretary&apos;s notes, but the formal decisionsof the Dardanelles Committee and the War Committee to the Dardanelles Commission.There is a precedent for this in the case of the Mesopotamian Commission, which was quite satisfied to receive the decisions and to cross-examine Ministers about them, and,in private conversation with Mr. Mears, I gather that this would probably satisfy theDardanelles Commission also.M. P. A. HANKEY.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,February 17, 1917.The Dardanelles Commission.Dear Sir Maurice, 2, Hare Court, Temple, E.C., February 16, 1917.. Sir William Pickford has written me a letter, of which I enclose you a copy. I might perhaps supplement it by drawing your attention to an extract from a letter fromSir Maurice Bonn am Carter to me, dated the 30th August, 1916, in which he says : &quot; Iam able to give you the answers to the three points raised by Lord Cromer when he called here some days ago. I understand from the Prime Minister that the ministers will have no objection to giving their evidence on oath. Lord Stamfordham haswritten to me to say that the King loill release them from their oath of secrecy for thepurpose of giving evidence before them.&quot;I have obtained the copy of the minutes of the War Council which were handedconfidentially to the late Lord Cromer.If you can spare me two niinutes I will return them to you personally.Yours sincerely,(Signed) E. GR1MWOOD M EARS.Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Maurice Hankey, K.C.B.,2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. :Dear Mears, Queen&apos;s House, Cheyne Walk, S.W., February 16, 1917.I hope you will be able to get evidence as to the proceedings of the War Counciland Dardanelles Committee before long. We cannot satisfactorily consider the conductof the operations unless we know the decisions of these bodies which are part of suchconduct. We have nearly finished the rest of the evidence, and I think it is important that we should have information as to these matters before Mr. Churchill givesevidence. He will no doubt give us evidence as to the proceedings and decisions, andextracts from the minutes, but they will be extracts taken quite fairly, but from our point of view, we can deal with more satisfactorily if we have the whole before us.Of course the most convenient form in which we could have the information isthat of a statement, supplemented by evidence, of Sir Maurice Hankey, as we had forthe first part of the enquiry, but I quite see that, considering all the calls uponSir Maurice&apos;s time, he may not be able to give us this.
But we could Lave the information either by his evidence, or that of some other person qualified to give an account of the proceedings, or by sending us a copy of theminutes.I understand from you that there is no objection to sending the Chairman such acopy, as was done in the first part of the enquiry, but that is of no use in the presentcircumstances.We had then an account given us by Sir Maurice Hankey, and the minutes were merely sent to the Commission to enable the Chairman to check this account. Atpresent we have no account of such proceedings in the period between May 1915 andthe evacuation, and to send the minutes to the Chairman would give no information tothe Commission if he might not show them to the members.I should think the Commission are just as much to be trusted with the minutesas the Chairman, even when he was as distinguished a man as the late Lord Cromer,but evidence in any form will be quite satisfactory.Will you see Sir Maurice Hankey about it ? If you like you can show him this letter.Yours, &amp;c.(Signed) W. PICKFORD.APPENDIX II.Draft Order in Council.1.
