THE Director of Military Intelligence reported successfulminor operations on the Western front in the direction of Gueudecourtd Beaucourt. He said that he had no information to support theo rt in the German wireless news that the enemy had recoveredthe lost trenches at Beaucourt. On the contrary, it was distinctlystated in Sir Douglas Haig&apos;s report that German counter-attacks had been repelled. A telegram had been sent to the Commander-in-Chief, France, asking if there was any foundation for the Germanclaims.2. General Macdonogh also stated that several Germanaeroplanes had been brought down on this front.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the War Cabinet.

Mesopotamia. 3. The  Director  of  Military  Intelligence  reported  furthersuccessful operations in the region of Kut-el-Amara, including theoccupation of all the enemy&apos;s trenches east of the Hai, an importantadvance west of the Hai, and the infliction of heavy losses on theenemy.General Macdonogh undertook to furnish Mr. Bonar Law andLord Curzon, for Parliamentary use, with such particularsas could safely be mentioned in public regarding thegreat improvement in the transport and commissariatarrangements of the Mesopotamia Expeditionary Force.Greece.General Sarrail.4. The Director of Military Intelligence communicated the contents of a telegram from the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Salonica, covering a communication from General Phillips,dated the 4th February, to the effect that, before leaving Athens forParis, Commander Roquefeuil, the French naval attache, had statedthat be would be returning shortly to establish a secret espionage in greece, necessitating that a force of 10,000 men should remain inthe country, including Thessaly and extending to the CorinthianGulf. General Phillips also stated that the view was rapidly gainingground that General Sarrail intended to occupy Greece and todethrone the King at all costs.The War Cabinet considered that, in view of General Sarrail&apos;sdefinite pledge to the Prime Minister during his recent visit to Rome,it was most unlikely that he would attempt any military operation against Greece without the consent of the Allied Governments, andthat no action, therefore, on our part was necessary.The Greek Troopsin Thessaly.5. The Director of Military Intelligence stated that information had been received from the Chief of the General Staff in Salonicato the effect that the only Greek troops remaining in NorthernGreece awaiting transport to the Morea were reported to be asfollows : 3 Batteries of Artillery,4 Regiments of Infantry,1 Regiment of Cavalry,and that the number of rifles in the hands of the Greek Reservistsin Thessaly was estimated not to exceed 10,000, including armsalready in the possession of natives.The Transport ofTroops to France.6. With reference to War Cabinet 54, Minute 8, the First sea lord reported that the Commander-in-Ohief at the Nore had nowbeen able to provide some vessels to escort our transports to France.In confirmation of the warning he had given the War Cabinet onthe previous day with regard to the dangers attending crossingduring bright moonlight, Admiral Jellicoe stated that two transportshad been attacked, though fortunately without success, by sub-marines on the previous night, notwithstanding the fact that theyhad an escort with them.In view of thegreaturgency of expediting the transport ofnew divisions to France, the War Cabinet decided that :-With the object of setting free transport, leave from france should be temporarily suspended ; that the particularperiods during which the suspension was to operate shouldbe arranged between the Admiralty and the General Staff.

The War Cabinet decided that : The House of Commons should be informed that the situation with regard to Franchise and Registration had obviously-been changed by the holding of the Speaker&apos;s Conference;that the House of Commons would have a very early opportunity of considering the question, but the exacimethod must be left for further consideration by theGovernment, which had during the past week been occupied with business of extreme urgency.Mr. Henderson dissented.(Initialled) D.

Conference on Electoral Reform.Letter from Mr. Speaker to the Prime Minister.Speaker&apos;s House, S.W.,January 27, 1917.Dear Prime Minister,I HAVE much pleasure in informing you that the Conference on Electoral Reformhas now completed its work, and that I am authorised to report to you the resolutionsat which it has arrived.You will doubtless remember the circumstances in which it originated, but for the sake of greater accuracy I will venture to detail them.During the debate on the second reading of the Special Register Bill on the 16thAugust last, Mr. Asquith, who was then Prime Minister, in the course of his speechused these words : &quot; With regard to the Parliament which is going to undertake the work of reconstruction after the war, it is eminently desirable that you should provide anelectoral basis which will make that Parliament reflective and representative of thegeueral opinion of the country, and give to its decisions a moral authority which you cannot obtain from what I may call a scratch, improvised, and makeshiftelectorate. Let us by all means use the time- those of us who are not absolutelyabsorbed in the conduct of the war- -in those months to see if we cannot work outby general agreement some scheme under which, both as regards the electorateand the distribution of electoral power, a Parliament can be created at the end ofthe war capable and adequate for discharging these tasks, and commanding theconfidence of the country.&quot;   (Official Report, vol. 85, p. 1906.)During the same debate Mr. Long, who was then President of the Local Govern-ment Board, said : &quot; I myself believe that if we agreed amongst ourselves, and the Governmentoffered any assistance which they could, and which, I believe, they would gladlydo, to set up I will not say a Committee, because that is not exactly what Imean-but a representative Conference, not only of parties, but of groups, aConference which would really represent opinion on these three subjects : electoral reform, revision of your electoral power when you have got it, and registration, Ibelieve and I do not speak altogether out of books that such a Conference ofearnest men, holding strong views, bitterly opposed to each other, if they wereface to face with these difficulties, when we are all longing with a great longingto see something of a better prospect for our country in the future, would produce an agreed system for all three questions upon which the great mass of opinion ofthe people of this country could come together.&quot;And again later in his speech he used these words : &quot; I believe that a. Conference such as I have suggested would have a greatresult. I hope that in the short time during which Parliament is released from its duties we shall all turn our attention to this question. If my honourable friends in any quarter of this House, or outside of this House were to invite me to help toget together such a Conference I would do it with the utmost pleasure; I believethat is the way in which we are more likely to find a solution to these problems than any other plan of which I have yet heard. It was recommended by the honourablegentleman the Member for Stockport in a speech he made, as being put forwardeither in public or private by manj^ of those who have given time and attention tothis question. I venture to say to the House it is our duty, one and all, notto criticise the Government or to find fault with this Bill, but to set ourselves to find a solution which may be a lasting settlement of a very old and difficult problem.&quot;   (Official Report, vol. 85, pp. 1949-1950.)The idea seemed to find favour, and soon afterwards I accepted an invitation fromthe Prime Minister to convene a Conference of members of both Houses of parliament and to preside over it. The Members of Parliament and Peers whom I selectedappeared to me to be eminently representative of the various shades of political
opinion in Parliament and in the country upon the special topics connected withElectoral Reform. Their numbers were as nearly as possible proportionate to thestrength of pre-war parties in the Plouse of Commons.On the question of Woman Suffrage I endeavoured to obtain an equal division ofopinion, so far as it could be ascertained, but many obvious difficulties presented them-selves in discovering the views of gentlemen upon that important topic.Eventually the following Peers and Members of Parliament accepted my invitation:the Marquess of Salisbury, Earl Grey, Viscount Bryce, Viscount Gladstone, LordBurnham, Sir Ryland Adkins, Right Honourable Sir Frederick Banbury, Sir JohnBethell, Sir William Bull, Colonel James Craig, Colonel Page Croft, Mr. Ellis Davies,Right Honourable W. H. Dickinson, Right Honourable Sir R. Finlay, Mr. Goldstone,Right Honourable Laurence Hardy, Mr. Maurice Healy, Right Honourable GeorgeLambert, Sir J. Larmor, Mr. Macmaster, Mr. J. Mooney, Mr. T. P. 0&apos;Connor, Mr. Peto,Mr. Pringle, Right Honourable Sir Harry Samuel, Mr. Scanlan, Mr. MacCallum Scott,Right Honourable Sir John Simon, Mr. Turton, Mr. Stephen Walsh, Mr. Wardle, andMr. Aneurin Williams.Before the Conference met, however, Lord Bryce and Mr. Laurence Hardy were obliged through illness to withdraw their acceptances, and Mr. Mooney also found himself unable to take part in. the proceedings. Their places were taken by LordSouthwark, Sir Robert Williams, and Mr. Brady.Mr. W. T. Jerred, C.B., Assistant Secretary to the Local Government Board, acted as Secretary to the Conference.The Conference met for the first time at the offices of the Local Government Boardon the 12th October last, but all subsequent meetings have been held in CommitteeRoom 15 at the House of Commons.The terms of reference were as follows: To examine, and, if possible, submit, agreed resolutions on the following matters :--(a.) Reform ofHhe Franchise.(6.) Basis for Redistribution of Seats.(c.) Reform of the System of the Registration of Electors.(d.) Method of elections and the manner in which the costs of elections should beborne.After our discussion had proceeded for some time, we were so unfortunate as to lose the assistance of Lord Grey, who was prevented by illness from attending, but as I wasin constant expectation that he might be able to resume his attendance I did not inviteany other gentleman to take his place.Sir Robert Finlay also, on his acceptance of office as Lord Chancellor in your government, was compelled, to the regret of all his colleagues, to leave us.On the 14th December Lord Salisbury, Sir F. Banbury, and Colonel Craig found themselves unable to continue to assist us, and resigned their positions as members ofthe Conference. Their places were taken by Mr. C. B. Stuart-Wortley (now LordStuart of Wortley), Mr. Touche, and Mr. Archdale, and it is perhaps only fair to mention that some of the conclusions of the Conference were arrived at before they became members of it.You will remember that when we had reached this point I consulted you as to thedesirability of continuing our labours, and you expressed the desire of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment that the work of the Conference should proceed.Altogether the Conference held twenty-six sittings, the last of which took placeon the 26th instant, when I was authorised to report to you the result of our delibera-tions.   This appears in the following series of resolutions: I. Registration of Electors.1. The qualifying period for registration as a Parliamentary elector shall be reducedto six months.2. There shall be a revision of the register every six months.3. The qualifying period&apos;shall be six months prior to the 15th January and 15 thJuly in each year.4. The time between the preparation and coming into force of the register shallbe shortened.
5. The foregoing resolutions (Nos. 2, 3, and 4) shall not apply to Ireland which,owing to different conditions, may require special treatment.6. In England and Wales a Registration Officer shall be appointed in everycounty and borough who shall be, in the case of a county, the Clerk of the CountyCouncil, and, in the case of a borough, the Town Clerk.7. An appeal from the decision of the Registration Officer shall lie to the county court.8. In the opinion of the Conference, the cost of registration should be a charge upon the local rates, subject to a contribution of one-half to be made by the State.II. He form of the Franchise.9. (a.) Every person of full age, not subject to any legal incapacity, who, for the qualifying period, has resided in any premises, or has occupied for the purpose of his business, profession, or trade, any premises of a clear yearly value of not less than 102.,shall be entitled to be registered as a Parliamentary Elector.(6.) For the purposes of this resolution no change shall be made in the law relatingto the joint occupation of business premises.(c.) A franchise based upon the foregoing qualifications shall be substituted for all existing franchises.Provided that the representation of the Universities shall be maintained.10. The qualification to be registered as a Parliamentary Elector shall not be lost by removal to different premises within the same constituency, or from one constituencyto another in the same borough or county (including the administrative County ofLondon), or to different premises in a contiguous county or boroughs.11. (a.) A person shall not vote at a general election in more than one constituency.Provided that a person shall be entitled to one additional vote in another con-stituency in respect of the occupation of his business premises, or in respect of anyqualification he may have as a University voter.(6.) For the purpose of this resolution the expression &quot;constituency&quot; means any country, borough, or combination of places, or university or combination of universities,returning a member or members to serve in Parliament, and where a county or boroughis divided for the purpose of Parliamentary elections, means a division of the county orborough so divided.12. The law relating to the franchise and registration shall be codified.III. Redistribution of Seats.13. This Conference accepts as governing any scheme of redistribution the prin-ciple that each vote recorded shall, as far as possible, command an equal share of representation in the House of Commons.1,4. It is desirable that there shall be a Redistribution of Seats in accordancewith the following general rules : (i.) The number of members of the House of Commons for Great Britain shall remain substantially as at present,(ii.) In the application of this principle the information at the disposal of theConference indicates the taking of  70,000 as the standard unit of population for each member,(iii.) A county or borough (other than the City of London) with a population of less than 50,000 shall cease to have separate representation,(iv.) A county or borough with a population of 50,000, but less than 70,000, shall continue to have separate representation,(v.) A municipal borough or urban district with a population not. less than70,000 shall become a separate Parliamentary borough,(vi.) A county or borough at present returning two members shall not lose amember if the defect in the population is 20,000 or less,(vii.) A member shall be given for 70,000 and for every multiple of 70,000, andan additional member for any remainder which is not less than 50,000.
(viii.) The boundaries of Parliamentary constituencies shall, as far as practicable,coincide with the boundaries of administrative areas.&quot; (ix.) The City of London shall continue as at present to return two members.15. Existing boroughs entitled to return two members shall not be divided.16. Where   there   are   contiguous  boroughs which,  if formed   into   a  singleconstituency, would be entitled to return not less than three nor more than five members, it shall be an instruction to the Boundary Commissioners to unite such. boroughs into a single constituency.(This resolution Would only become applicable in the event of a system of proportional Representation being adopted, as recommended in a subsequentresolution.)17. It shall be an instruction to the Boundary Commissioners to take thepopulation as estimated by the Registrar-General for July 1914, instead of thepopulation uccording the census of 1911.18. It shall be a recommendation to the Boundary Commissioners, after ascer-taining local opinion, to segregate as far as possible adjacent industrial and rural areasin forming constituencies within any county.19. Where, under the application of these rules, a borough loses its right to separate representation in Parliament, it shall be competent for the Commissioners,after having ascertained local opinion on the subject, to combine such borough with anyother such borough or boroughs lying within the county, or with any other borough inthe same county having separate representation, instead of merging it in the adjacentcounty division.20. Where an ancient Parliamentary borough loses it representation, the countydivision in which the borough becomes merged shall be named after the mergedborough.21. Where districts of burghs in Scotland comprise burghs in different counties, or where under the foregoing rules a Parliamentary borough which is a district of burghswould lose representation, it shall be an instruction to the Boundary Commissioners toconsider the desirability of regrouping the burghs or adding neighbouring burghs in thesame county, regard being had to their size, to a proper representation of the urban and rural population, and to the distribution and pursuits of such population :Provided that the representation of the county is not thereby affected.As regards Ireland, the Conference desires to place on record that, on thesubject of redistribution, it has carried on its deliberations from the point of viewof Great Britain only.IV. University Representation.22. (a.) The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge shall continue to returntwo members each ; the electorate shall be widened, and, in order to secure a properrepresentation of minorities, each voter shall be allowed to vote for one candidateonly. ^ .     ^ . ^        :- V   .(6.) The Universities of Durham, Manchester, Birmingham, Liverpool, Leeds,Sheffield, Bristol, and the University of Wales, shall receive representation ; theseuniversities shall be grouped with the University of London so as to form asingle constituency returning three members elected on the system of a single transferable vote.(c.) The combined Universities of Edinburgh and St. Andrews and of Glasgowand Aberdeen shall also be grouped so as to form a single constituency returningthree members under the system, of a single transferable vote.(cZ.) As regards all Universities the obtaining of a degree shall be the basis forelectoral qualification.V. Method and Costs of Elections.23.  (a.) A Parliamentary borough which would be entitled on a basis of population to return three or more members shall be a single constituency.
Provided that a constituency entitled to return more than five members shall be divided into two or more constituencies each returning not less than three nor morethan five members.(6.) The election in any such constituency shall be held on the principle of proportional representation and each elector shall have one transferable vote.(c.) For the purposes of this rule the Metropolis (excluding the City of London)shall be treated as a single area and divided into constituencies returning not less than three nor more than five members.24, (a.) At a general election all polls shall be held on one day.(6.) All nominations shall take place on one day.(c.) There shall be an interval of eight days between the day of nomination and theday of poll.25. Returning Officers&apos; charges should be paid by the State on a scale to be fixed by the Treasury.26. The duties of Returning Officer in England and Wales shall be discharged bya deputy Returning Officer, who shall be in the case of a county the Clerk to theCounty Council, and in the case of a borough the Town Clerk.27. (a.) Every candidate at the election of a Member of Parliament for any country or borough shall be required to deposit with the Returning Officer, at the timeof hirt nomination, the sum of one hundred and fifty pounds.(b.) If a candidate is not elected, and the number of votes polled by him does notexceed in the case of a single or double member constituency one-eighth of the totalnumber of voters polling-, or in the case of a constituency returning three or more members, one-eighth divided by the number of members to be elected, the depositinstead of being returned to the candidate shall be forfeited to the Treasury.(c.) For the purposes of this resolution the number of &quot; voters polling &quot; shall mean the number of ballot papers counted other than spoilt ballot papers; and where theelection is held under the system of a single transferable vote, the number of &quot;votes,polled&quot; by a candidate shall mean the number of votes polled by him as first preferences.Although the question of candidates&apos; expenses does not appear to be strictly within their terms of reference, the Conference is strongly and unanimously of opinion thatthe expenditure&apos;at present entailed in fighting a contested election is unjustifiable, andshould be materially reduced. This, the Conference considers can only be effectivelycarried out by an alteration in the maximum amounts at present allowed under theCorrupt and Illegal Practices Prevention Act, 1883. The Conference accordinglyresolved that 28. (a.) The following maximum scale of expenses shall be substituted for themaximum scale contained in Part IV of the First Schedule to the Corrupt and IllegalPractices Prevention Act, 1883 : -Sevenpence per elector in a county.Fivepence per elector in a borough other than a borough returning three or more members.Fourpence per elector in a borough returning three or more members.(6.) Where there are joint candidates the total amount of the expenses of thejoint candidates shall not exceed one and a half times the scale allowed for a singlecandidate.(c.) A duly nominated candidate, or a number of duly nominated joint candidates,shall be allowed one free postage.In this connection the Conference has had its attention drawn to a growingand, as it considers, mischievous practice by which, at the time of an election, politicaland other organisations incur expenditure in the furtherance of the views of particularcandidates. The practice is, in the view of the Conference, a contravention of thespirit of the Corrupt and Illegal Practices Prevention Act. The Conference realisesthe difficulty of dealing with the matter, but thinks that some amendment of theAct is very desirable, and resolved that 29. Any person incurring expenditure by holding public meetings or issuing-advertisements or publications for the purpose of furthering the election of a candidate,
tshall be guilty of a corrupt practice unless such expenditure is authorised by the candidate and returned as part of his election expenses.30. The Ballot Act shall be made permanent.VI. The Local Government Register.The franchise for Local Government purposes is so closely connected with theParliamentary franchise that the Conference thought it desirable to deal with thematter, and resolved that 31. (a.) In substitution for all existing franchises for Local Governmentpurposes every person who for a period of six months immediately preceding theloth day of January and the 15th day of July in any year has occupied as owner ortenant any land or premises in a Local GoA&apos;ernment area in England and Wales shall beentitled to be registered and to vote as a Local Government elector in that area.(6.) For the purpose of this resolution neither sex nor marriage shall be a disqualification-cation, provided that a husband and wife shall not both be qualified in respect of thesame premises.(c.) The Conference makes no recommendation with regard to the Local Govern-ment franchisein Scotland or Ireland.VII. Soldiers and Sailors,32. (a.) It shall be the duty of the Registration Officer to ascertain, as far as possible,the names and addresses of all persons of full age who ordinarily reside in his area, but who are serving in His Majesty&apos;s forces, and such persons shall be qualified to be registered and to vote as parliamentary electors within that area.(6.) In the case of a person who has served in His Maiesty&apos;s forces during any partof the qualifying period, residence in a constituency for one month immediately preceding the 15th January or the 15th July, as the case may be, shall be a sufficientqualification.All the resolutions under the foregoing sub-heads I to VII were agreed tounanimously.VIII. Woman Suffrage.The Conference decided by a majority that some measure of woman suffrage shouldbe conferred. A majority of the Conference was also of opinion that if parliament should decide to accept the principle, the most practical form would be to confer the vote in the terms of the following resolution : 33. Any woman on the Local Government Register who has attained a specifiedage, and the wife of any man who is on that Register if she has attained that age,shall be entitled to be registered and to vote as a parliamentary elector.Various ages were discussed, of which 30 and 35 received most favour.The Conference further resolved that if Parliament decides to enfranchise women,a woman of the specified age, who is a graduate of any University having parliamentaryrepresentation shall be entitled to vote as a University Elector.IX. Miscellaneous.The Conference resolved unanimously that:- 34. The maintenance in any asylum for lunatics or idiots of any person for whosemaintenance any other person is responsible shall not disqualify such other person forbeing registered as a Parliamentary elector.The following resolutions were passed by a majority: 35. This Conference, having considered the recommendation of the RoyalCommission on the Poor Laws and Belief of Distress, is of opinion that no person whohas received poor relief other than medical relief for less than thirty days in theaggregate during the qualifying period, shall be disqualified for being registered as *a.parliamentary elector.36. At any election in a single member constituency where there are more than two candidates, the election shall be held on the system of voting known as thealternative vote.
37. (a.) Provision shall be made to enable any person who is on the Parlia-mentarj- Register in any constituency to have his name entered in a List of AbsentVoters, and to record his vote as such, provided that he satisfies the registration officer that the nature of his employment will render it probable that he will be compelled to be absent from the constituency on the day when the poll will be taken.(6.) The Absent Voters&apos; List shall be prepared at the same time as the ordinaryRegister, and should remain in force during the currency of that Register.(c.) A printed ballot paper shall be sent to every voter at the address registeredby him for the purpose in such form and manner as will secure the secrecy of the ballot.(d.) The ballot paper shall be returnable by post on or before the polling day,accompanied by a statutory declaration of identity in a prescribed form.(e.) A person whose name is on the Absent Voters&apos; List shall not be entitled to vote otherwise than as an absent voter.In conclusion, I should like to bear witness to the admirable temper and conciliatorydisposition which all the members ,of the Conference showed in grappling with thedifficulties confronting them. They were convinced, I feel sure, of the great desirabilityof amicably settling these thorny questions, and of finding a solution for issues fraughtwith the possibility of engendering grave domestic strife and internal friction. Theywere desirous of rendering, at a time when the national energies were almost whollycentred upon the successful prosecution of the war, a service which might prove of thehighest value to the State, and result in equipping the nation with a truly representativeHouse of Commons, capable of dealing, and dealing effectively, with the many andgigantic problems which it will have to face and solve as soon as the restoration ofpeace permits of their calm and dispassionate consideration.As a last word, I should like to say, on behalf of all the members of the Conference,how deeply they are indebted to Mr. Jerred for his unfailing courtesy, his untiringenergy, and his accurate acquaintance with the technicalities of electoral matters, all of&quot;which gifts he placed unreservedly at the disposal of the Conference.Yours very truly,JAMES W. LOWTHER.To the Right Hon. the Prime Minister.APPENDIX II.Franchise and Registration.IF it is thought that difficulty may be anticipated in asking Parliament to accepta Bill based upon the conclusions arrived at by the Speakers Conference, the question arises as to the alternative courses which are open to the Government.In considering this question the facts as to the possible continuance of the present parliament should be borne in mind. The present Parliament, elected when theSeptennial Act was still in force, met on the 31st January, 1911 ; the Parliament Act,1911, reduced the seven years to five years, but by the two successive Acts passed in1916 its life has now been extended until the 30th April next. It could be furtherextended until January 19IS without going beyond the normal period of seven years.And to meet the alleged objection to Parliament again prolonging its existence, it can reasonably be contended that a further extension is merely a reversion in exeptional and unforeseen circumstances to the septennial period.Tho alternative courses seem to be : 1. A dissolution and a general election within the next two months.2. A further prolongation of the life of Parliament till January next.The first course would mean an election on the present stale Register, with an enormous number of the electors serving with the forces abroad, or removed into other districts in munitions and other work, in circumstances which would preclude theirvoting.The second alternative, the further prolongation of Parliament, might be accompanied by provision for a new Register, or it might not.   If it were not, it would
obe urged that the present Register would be even worse at the end of the year than itis now. If, on the other hand, extension were to be coupled with a new Register, thequestion at once arises, what is that Register to be ? The answer to this question isthat, it must be either (a) a new Register made up on the old lines with the twelvemonths&apos; qualification, or (6) a Special Register.(a.) A new Register on the old lines will rule out practically all the soldiers and sailors as well as a great number of the munition workers. A certain number ofsoldiers and sailors would have a right to be registered under the provisions of the electoral Disabilities (Naval and Military Services) Removal Act, 1914, which preventsa soldier from being disfranchised merely by reason of &apos;: absence,&quot; but does not savehis vote where he has given up the qualifying premises. And the munition workers who have left their homes are not helped at all, as they do not come under the Act.(6.) If a special Register is to be made, can a more effective measure be framed!than the Special Register Bill which was dropped last August; and if not, can thatmeasure be revived ?To recapitulate, the alternative courses are :  1. A dissolution and general election on the old Register before April.2. A prolongation of Parliament and an election about the end of the year on theold Register.3. A. prolongation of Parliament and a new Register on the old lines.4. A prolongation of Parliament and a Special Register to bring in soldiers,sailors, and munition workers.As regards (1), it must be remembered that, under Section 3 of the parliament and Local Elections Act, 1916, a Parliament so elected would last for two years only,but soldiers and sailors and the great bulk of munition workers up and down thecountry would have no voice in its election.The same objection as to the exclusion of soldiers and sailors and munition workers generally would apply to (2) and (3).As regards (4), it was the great difficulty surrounding a Special Register which gave rise to the suggestion that an agreement might be reached on the wider questionof the franchise, which would be acceptable to the country generally. Thoseresolutions of the Speakers Conference, which were unanimously agreed to, seem torepresent a reasonable compromise. It must also be remembered, as stated in the speakers letter, that the Conference was expressly desired to continue its work by thepresent Government.A mere recital of the alternative courses open to the Government seems to renderobvious the Parliamentary difficulties which surround each one of them.It must also be borne in mind that the question of a new Register is becomingurgent, and that the machinery of registration, which is at present stopped, cannot berestarted without legislation.And, moreover, the depletion of the staffs of local authorities and the difficultiesconnected with printing will so far retard the preparation of a Register that at least six months will be required for the purpose.(Initialled) W. T. J.Local Government Board, February 3, 1917.
