The War Cabinet resumed the discussion of Man-Power and.Compulsory National Service (War Cabinet 7, paragraph 1).(a.) They had before them copies of a statement on the subject which it was proposed should be made by the Prime Minister andLord Curzon in the House of Commons and the House of Lordsrespectively this day. The Cabinet decided to adopt, in principle,the conclusion arrived at by the War Committee of the late Govern-ment on the 30th November, 1916 (W.C-.94, Conclusion 5^ alreadyprinted as Appendix I of Paper War Cabinet 7).(b.) Mr. Henderson having reported the result of his discussionwith his colleagues, the Cabinet agreed that, having regard to thefeeling of organised labour on the subject of industrial compulsion,and the pledges given by the late Government, and to the volume of preliminary work necessary for the creation of an adequate and efficient machinery, local and central, it would be necessary toproceed, in the firs&apos;t instance, on the lines of voluntary enrolmentand transference of labour without a Bill. At the same time, it was thought to be essential that an announcement of the appointment ofthe Director of National Service should be made forthwith and,Mr. Montagu having declined- to accept the position, it was resolved to approach Mr. Neville Chamberlain.(c.) It was further agreed that, in the statement to be made to theHouses, an assurance should be given that labour would be associated with any organisation which it was decided to establishunder the Director of National Service, and that no time limit should be fixed for the introduction of compulsion, but that the
2Prime Minister and Lord Curzon should make it clear that, if the voluntary effort failed, the Government would ask Parliament to release them from any pledges heretofore given on the subject ofindustrial compulsion, and to furnish them with adequate powers for rendering their proposals effective.(d.) In the meantime, it would be the duty of the Director to setup, for voluntary enrolment and transference, machinery which mighthereafter serve the purpose of compulsion, if compulsion became necessary.(e.) The Minister of Labour raised the question of further taxation of profits, and it was decided that, while it was desirable that an assurance should be given that in the further calls which werebeing made upon the nation capital should be required to make its contribution, the Government should reserve to themselves theright of considering in greater detail the question of method.( /.) The Secretary of State for War wished to have it put on record that, in order to maintain the drafts, not less than 100,000men fit for general service must be obtained during January,and that in his opinion it would soon become necessary for theGovernment to introduce an amending Military Service Bill.Prime MinistersMessage toSelf-GoverningDominions.Attended for thisQuestion:Mr. W.&apos;Long, M.P.,S. of S. for theColonies.2. The Secretary of State for the Colonies submitted for theapproval of the War Cabinet the following draft of a telegram whichhe suggested should be sent in the Prime Ministers name to the governors of the self-governing Dominions : &quot; On taking up the high office with which His Majesty hascharged me, I send you on behalf of the people of the OldCountry a message to our brothers beyond the seas. There isno faltering in our determination that the sacrifices which we and you have made, and have still to make, shall not be invain, and that the fight which we are waging together forhumanity and civilisation shall be fought to a triumphantissue.&quot; We realise that we shall need every man that we can putin the field, every pound that rigid public and private economycan provide, and every effort which a united people can put&apos; forth to help the heavy task of our soldiers and sailors. Thesplendid contributions to the common cause already made bythe Dominions give us sure confidence that their determinationis no less high than ours, and that, however long the path to final victory, we shall tread it side by side. Lloyd George.&quot;The War Cabinet approved the draft and the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies was authorised to despatch it without delay.The Arab revolt   3. Lord Robert Cecil (acting for the Secretary of State for ForeignPiabegh. Affairs) represented that it appeared from the Sirdar&apos;s telegramsAttended for this    Nos. 77 and Sri, dated the 13th and 16th instant, respectively, that question: . ,    Sir Reginald Wingate was &quot;uncertain as to the exact nature of the.A.Chamberlain,   orders and instructions of His Majesty&apos;s Government to himself inM.P., S. of S. for   regard to the despatch of a European brigade to. Rabegh to assistIndia. the Sherif.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff pointed out that theSirdaFs telegrams above referred to must have crossed the reply from the Foreign Office, No. 45, dated the 15th instant.The War Cabinet considered that the terms of this lattertelegram (a paraphrase of which is printed as Appendix I) indicated,with sufficient clarity, the authority delegated to Sir R. Wingate inthis connection, and also the discretionary power granted to him toact in certain circumstances.
APPENDIX I.Foreign Office Telegram to the Sirdar, No. 45, dated December 15, 1916, 7T5 p.m.(Paraphrase.)IN reply to your cable No. 77, it is quite understood that, should the Sherif&apos;smovement unfortunately collapse, the responsibility for the debacle will rest with him,on account of his last definite refusal of British military aid, which he had sought, andwhich we were ready to provide. You are authorised by the British Government tomake all the necessary preparations to despatch a British brigade, as well as a Frenchcontingent, if you can supply transport for them, and if you are satisfied in regard tothe various conditions set out in our earlier telegrams. If you think it prudent and desirable, you may also let the Sherif know that the offensive in Sinai will beginalmost at once. The result of this should be that very material assistance would be rendered to him on that side, more particularly if he Could persuade the Arabs in southern Palestine to rise against the Ottoman Empire.PBIHTED AT THE FOBEIGN OFFICE BT 0. B. HARRISON.-21/12/1916.It was decided that the Foreign Office should telegraph to theSirdar that he evidently had not received their telegram No. 45 ofthe 15th instant, the terms of which covered the various points raised in his cables Nos. 77 and 86.(Initialled)   D. LI. G.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,December 19, 1916.
