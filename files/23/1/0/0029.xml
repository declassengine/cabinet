E.Jellicoe. first sea Lord of theAdmiralty. ,1. The Director of Military Operations stated that our military Attache in Roumania had reported that both GeneralsSakharof and Berthelot had expressed the hope that the Russo-Roumanian forces would be able to hold the enemy on the defensiveline they proposed to take up on the River Sereth. General Sakharofcontemplated an offensive on the right bank of the Sereth, butthe prospects of this attack achieving much were not great. TheKing of Roumania was now Commander-in-chief of the allied troops in Roumania with Sakharof as his Chief Military Adviser.The Western 2. It was brought to the notice of the War Cabinet that bothFront. in Allied and neutral countries there still was a quite inadequaterealisation of the part that the British Empire was taking in thewar. Mr. A. Henderson stated that, during his recent visit toFrance, he discovered obsolete and misleading maps still in circu-lation which only showed the extent of front in France held byBritish troops many months back.It was agreed that it was desirable to take steps to removemisapprehensions on this point, and, with this end in view, theDirector of Military Operations undertook to prepare a shortsummary of the facts, the tenor of which should be informatory andstrictly non-controversial. General Maurice pointed out that thepresent moment, however, was not opportune for the publication
of a statement regarding the length of our front, but that a statement as to the strength of the enemy on our own and the French frontsmight be put in such a form as to be harmless from a military pointof view.The War Cabinet decided that-A draft summary should be prepared by the Imperial GeneralStaff for their approval and for use in due course.Indian Shipping:Transport of families.con-with3,   4,Hirtzel,AttendednectionMinutesand 5 :Sir    A.India Office.General    Sir    E.Barrow,     IndiaOffice.Mr.   L.   Oliphant,Foreign Office.3. The Secretary of State for India pointed out that ships pro-ceeding to and from India and Great Britain carried large numbersof women and children, which meant that a considerable amount of accommodation was taken up for non-essential purposes. A furthereffect was that, in the event of the ship foundering from any cause,the risk from loss of life among military and civil officials and otherson the ship was increased owing to the difficulty of providing forthe safety of the said women and children. It was suggestedthat families travelling between England and India should be encouraged to use the Cape route whenever possible.Lord Curzon stated that a representation to the same effect hadbeen received by. him, and that he had passed it on to the Presidentof the Board of Trade for his observations.Rabegh: The Arab 4. The War Cabinet had before them a telegram from theRevolt. General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Egypt, No. 1475, to theChief of the lmperal General Staff.The Secretary of State for India pointed out that the King ofHedjaz in his message appeared to throw the responsibility for the landing of Christian troops on Sir R. Wingate. Mr. Chamberlainconsidered that it was essential that the King should ask for this assistance in writing, and at the -same time he should issue amanifesto over his own signature, in terms approved by Sir R.Wingate, explaining exactly why he had urged us to send troops,and taking full responsibility upon himself, in order to allay anysuspicions of Moslems in general and Indian Moslems in particularin regard to our interference in Hedjaz affairs. It might be addedthat the troops would be withdrawn as soon as the military necessityfor their presence had ceased.The Director of Military Operations explained that, since theoriginal decision to send a brigade from Egypt to Rabegh had beentaken, the situation had modified considerably. His informationwent to show that the Turks at Medina were short both of provisions and transport animals, while the Arabs were already beginning totamper with the Turkish railway communications to the south.Further, Sir Archibald Murray&apos;s movements in the Sinai Peninsulawould increase the probability of an extension of the Arab rising inSouth Palestine. It was therefore submitted that the case was not one of extreme urgency.General Maurice also drew attention to the fact that ColonelWilson, at Jeddah,, was not satisfied with the form which the king of the Hedja/.&apos;s request for these troops had taken, inasmuch as hethrew the onus of responsibility for admitting Christians into theHedjaz upon His Majesty&apos;s Government,After some discussion it was decided :    &apos;(1.) That the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, inconsultation with the Foreign Office, and the IndiaOffice, should send a telegram to the High commissioner in the sense that no troops should be despatched toRabegh until a written communication had been receivedfrom the King of the Hedjaz definitely asking for troops and accepting complete responsibility for such action,and further, that the King of the Hedjaz should be
sb.^ required to send the draft of a manifesto explaining his action for the approval of His Majesty&apos;s Government.(2.) That the Chief of the Imperial General Staff should alsotelegraph to the High Commissioner asking him toreport, whether, if such an operation were authorised,the Turkish troops encamped in the vicinity of Medinacould be attacked by machine gun fire from anti-aircraft operating from Rabegh and Yembo without infringingour promise to respect the Holy Places.Southern Persia. 5. The Director of Military Operations submitted that theoperations in Southern Persia, conducted by Sir Percy Sykes, had now become of such importance that they should be regarded as military operations proper* In these circumstances it was submitted that they should come under the control of a purely military commander responsible to a military authority, but assisted by theadvice of a local political officer.The War Cabinet agreed that it was neither possible nordesirable to place these operations under the General OfficerCommanding Force &quot; D.&quot; They further agreed that, in view of ourrelations with Russia and with the Persian Government, it wasexpedient for the Southern Persian Rifles to retain its nominalposition as a Persian armed police force.The War Cabinet decided that . The preparation for and the control of any military operationsit might be expedient to undertake in Southern Persiashould be in the hands of the Governor-General in Councilin India, subject to the proviso that Sir Charles Marlingshould be kept fully informed of any proposed measures and subsequent action taken, and also in touch with theOfficer Commanding the Expedition.They agreed in principle that it was necessary that Sir PercySykes should hold on to Shiraz. If a force operated from Bushireas suggested by Sir P. Sykes and Sir C. Marling, it must not go beyond the plains and must not on any account commit itself to anyoperations in the hills. If reinforcements were to be sent to Sir P.Sykes, they must proceed from Lingah or Bandar Abbas.In view of the fact that any force employed in this theatre must come from India, and would therefore have to be subtracted fromtroops from India otherwise available for different theatres, the WarCabinet further decided that The Secretary of State for India should telegraph to the Indian. Government requesting them to furnish an appreciation ofthe general position of affairs in Southern Persia, stating the military measures they considered should be adopted,the routes they advised that a military relieving force should follow, and the number of troops of all arms ofwhich that force should consist.(Initialled)      A.
