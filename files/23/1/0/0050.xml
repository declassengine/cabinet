Railways.&quot;War Medal for10. The Shipping Controller submitted a memorandumrespecting delays at certain ports in unloading cargoes.It was suggested that if the railways could handle the cargoesmore expeditiously the ships would be &quot; turned round&quot; morespeedily, and the result would be an estimated saving in tonnage of4,000,000 to 5,000,000 tons per annum. The President of theBoard of Trade suggested that an Inter-Departmental Committeeshould be set up composed of representatives of the ShippingController, Ministry of Munitions, and Board of Trade, which wouldinvestigate and report what steps, if any, could be taken whichwould secure the quicker unloading of the ships.The War Cabinet decided that  ,Mr. A.

COPY of an en clair intercepted wireless message from Berlin to German embassy at Washington made at 11 a.m. on the 31st January, 1917 : &quot; The German Government have conclusive proof that in several instances... .&apos; euemy hospital ships have often been misused for the transport of munitions and troops.   The German Government, through diplomatic channels, have placedv   these proofs before the British and French Governments, and has at the sametime declared that traffic of hospital ships on the military routes for the forcesfighting in France and Belgium, within a line drawn between Flamborough Headand Terschelling on the one hand, and from Ouessant and Land&apos;s End on theother, will no longer be tolerated.   The enemy Powers are at liberty to carryon their traffic of hospital ships for the transport of the sick and wounded men,  belonging to the army on routes outside this area.   In case hospital ships are in.&apos;.   the future put to uses of transport contrary to the law of nations, the prohibition.of further sea routes is hereby reserved--(to the German Government) &quot;APPENDIX II.Naval Conference Conclusions.1. ARE the Allies making the best use of their shipping ; and how best can theyhelp one another for the common cause ?2. The question of supply of coal to France and Italy ; amounts required and means of transport.It was agreed : (a.) That it is of paramount importance that the Government of each AlliedCountry, with a view to assisting the transport of articles which are essentialto the successful prosecution of the war, should take immediate steps to restrict to the utmost possible extent the importation of all other articles.(6.) That a Standing International Shipping Committee be appointed to obtainand exchange full and up-to-date information as to the employment of the mercantile vessels under the control of the several Allies, to ascertain whether, by co-operative programmes or otherwise, the transport of essential articles can be increased, and to make such consequent arrange-ments with the respective Governments as may appear desirable.It was agreed that the following recommendation of the Italian Delegates should at once be brought to the notice of the Cabinets of England and France : Considering that, in consequence of the tonnage situation, some Allied countries are already experiencing the lack, of raw material and other supplies essentialto the prosecution of the war and to the existence of the population ;Considering that any prolongation of this state of things is bound, within a briefperiod of time, to result in curtailing the powers of resistance of such allies in relation to the war ;Considering, further, that the agreed principle of community of resources and opportunities carries with it also equality of privations and sacrifices ;It was agreed : (a.) That a general revision of the employment of every single unit of the entireAllied Merchant Fleet shall be made, with the object of ascertaining wether and whence it is possible to divert further tonnage to more essential requirements.(o.) That as a result of such revision, a redistribution of the tonnage belonging tothe Allies or controlled by them shall be proceeded with, in proportion withtheir respective needs, and in such manner as to ensure equal powers of resistance to all nations engaged in the war.
(c.) That any eventual deficit existing between tonnage possibilities and theascertained needs of the Allies shall be calculated, these needs beingclassified on an equal basis-of., priority from the point of view of theirrelation to the war to the sustenance and life of the people.(d.) That the Ministers responsible in all the Allied countries for the food of thepeople should be asked to provide, by common accord: Firstly, for the complete elimination of all forms of consumption. which are not strictly essential.Secondly, for the reduction also of essential requirements, if necessary,by means of immediate rationing, without such limits as may befound necessary to cope with any deficit ascertained in the mannerabove indicated.To this was added a representation by General DalTOlio to this effect: &quot; If Italy does not get the tonnage, the necessity of which was set out in the note submitted yesterday, the production of ammunition will be stopped in March,and the offensive will be impossible, the defensive paralysed.&quot;In general the representatives of France and Italy impressed on the conference the absolute necessity of a constant and continuous supply of coal to France and Italy,failing which the output of munitions would be gravely imperilled.The First Lord undertook that this point would be kept before the notice of theCabinet.3. Whether the congestion at French ports, due to lack of rolling-stock, can befurther.relieved, and, if so, how.As regards (3), the Conference accepted the assurance of the French delegatesthat everything that could be was being done to relieve the congestion at the French ports, by increasing rolling stock and labour on the railways, and especially by establishing depots inland from the ports for the detraining of material, therebyrelieying the sheds at the docks.   -. 4. The shipping resources of the three countries, what can be done towardsbuilding merchant ships and patrol craft, and their types.French.The statement of the French officers showing the requirements for materials, steeh-and engines, having been handed in and read, the Third Sea Lord promised that everyeffort would be made to meet them, and that it appeared possible that the Ministry ofMunitions might be able to reduce temporarily the work on shell steel for the french army (in view of the large accumulation in England), so that the steel required by theFrench Xayy can be rolled.As regards thirteen merchant cargo-ships, nearing completion, arrangements willbe made for the immediate supply of the outstanding material required to completethem, as soon as the details of requirements have been received from the C.I.R.With regard to engines for motor lighters and for tugs, it was pointed out thatsome of the former required might  be ordered at once from Messrs. Ruston Proctor, ofLincoln, and that engines for one or two tugs from Messrs. Sissons, of Gloucester.. To facilitate supplies of steel material it was agreed that : (a.) Qualities demanded should be reduced to two, namely, boiler plates andconstructional, and(6.) The nearest British dimensions would be accepted instead of metxdc.Italian.The Italian requirements having been handed in and read, the Third Sea Lordstated that every effort would be made to supply these increased requirements over those which were already being arranged for, but that in the present stringency of rawmaterial, and the great demand on the rolling mills of the country for the Allied.
Armies and Navies, it was impossible to guarantee until tbe position has again been^thoroughly gone into by the Minister of Munitions that the amount can be supplied.5. Questions relating to alterations in the zones in the Mediterranean.It was agreed : (1.) That the dividing line between Zones V and VII should be a line joiningElaphonisi (south-west point of Crete) to Cape Spartivento at a position15 miles from Cape Spartivento ;(2.) That the dividing line between Zones V and X should be the meridian ofElaphonisi to the southward ;(3.) That the dividing line between Zones VII and VIII should be a line joiningCape Tripiti, in Crete, to the south point of Santorin, thence following theEast Coast of Santorin to the north-east point of Sikino, thence follow theEast Coast of Siphano to the north-east point of Serpho to the south pointof Thermia to Cape t &quot;olonna ;(4.) That the dividing line between Zones VIII and X should remain unaltered,except when it is affected by the slight modification of the meridianseparating Zones V and X.The chart cutting attached shows the new areas.6. Interchange of view as to the best means of protecting shipping in theMediterranean against submarines, escorts, patrols, and routes. Representatives shouldbe supplied with lists of places in the Mediterranean near the trade routes which areprotected against submarine attack.As a result of the discussion the following decisions were arrived at: In the Western Basin of the Mediterranean it was agreed That the coastal route should be utilised as much as possible, and that each country should decide as to whether their vessels should take the directroute from Marseilles to Algiers, that is, by the route arranged by the FrenchMinistry of Marine.That the question of protection with nets of certain ports should be looked into, aud ifthe British Government can spare any nets, they will communicate with theMinistry of Marine at Paris and Rome as to where they would suggest thesenets being placed.In the Eastern Basin of the Mediterranean it was agreed To adopt the proposed French system of fixed routes, frequently changed, fortraffic to aud from Salonica and the iEgean, and to adopt the proposedEnglish system of dispersion for traffic between Cape Bon and Port Said for.  British vessels, and Allied vessels if desired.That the British undertake to maintain the patrols on the French routes, and thatno patrol vessels will be diverted from these patrols for employment inconnection with the dispersed routes. After a period of trial, the working ofthe two systems to be compared at a joint conference with a view to theadoption of a permanent system.General.It was agreed that the British Admiralty should arrange for a representative to beappointed on the staff of Rear-Admiral Fatou, and that, if possible, he should, beCaptain G. B. Powell, formerly on the staff of Admiral Limpus. The further question as to whether Admiral Fatou shoxdd be at Malta or at Bona will be investigated by admiral de Bon, and a further communication sent in due course.It was agreed that stations for aircraft should be organised at Lampedusa andLarsala (jn Sicily), so that the French aircraft from Bizerta can utilise these places, andconsequently increase their radius of action. These sub-bases to be available for theBritish &apos; aircraft from Malta, as also the British station at Malta to be available tothe French aircraft from Bizerta. Generally, that British or French aircraft should use any of these stations as may be necessary.[1365-50] D
7. Provision of protection that can be given to the British drifters of theOtranto barrage.With reference to paragraph 7, the Allied Delegates recognised that the meansactually available for the Otranto barrage are not sufficient for the purpose. But since it has been suggested that for the more efficient organisation and the better defence ofthe drifters, it would be advisable to put this service under the command of a british naval officer, who would be under the orders of the Italian Commander-in-Chief ; theItalian and French Delegates concur with this suggestion, and unanimously declare that they will place at the disposal of the British Commodore all the craft availablein those waters which are not employed elsewhere.The Italian Minister of Marine requests that the new appointment of the BritishCommodore should not take place before the 15th February next.8. Question whether offensive operations in the Adriatic are possible, and, if so,their nature.It was agreed that major naval operations in the Adriatic were not at presentpossible ; but that minor operations should be carried out with vigour.9. The need of paying off British battleships now employed in the Mediterranean,in order to provide crews for ships.With reference to paragraph 9, the Italian Delegates have pointed out that theonly enemy naval force to be confronted in the Mediterranean is the Austrian Fleetshut in the Adriatic, and that therefore it is necessary to have ready and concentratedat all times a superior fleet in opposition.While this purpose was satisfactorily fulfilled by the Fleet concentrated in article 2of the Naval Convention, the situation, as altered by the withdrawal of the &quot; Queen&quot;division, would be unfavourably changed especially if account is taken of the losses sustained thus far by the Italian Navy.Besides, military and political considerations demand that the Fleet should notonly be ready to fight the Austrian Fleet, but also to prevent raids or other operations of any sort by naval detachments on the Italian coast.For this second condition, naval forces have so far been successfully maintained at Venice, Brindisi, and Valona ; and their continuous service has consequently entaileddeterioration and losses amongst the torpedo and light craft.For- these reasons the withdrawal of the British Division should take place only ifa substantial French naval force were permanently stationed at Corfu. The BritishAdmiralty are to make every effort to reinforce the First Allied Squadron by a convenient number of light craft when available.The Italian Delegates declare that should the Allies not take in consideration allthese circumstances, the conditions on which the possibility is founded of continuing the effort to bring the war to a successful conclusion would be seriously compromised.With reference to the Command of the Allied Naval Forces in the Adriatic, whichit was understood was appertaining to the Italian Admiral, it has now been decidedthat such Command would be taken over by the French Commander-in-Chief in the eventuality of the greater part of the French Naval Forces in the Mediterraneantaking part in operations in the Adriatic.10. Anti-Submarine patrols off Ushant.Report of Sub-Committee.Vice-Admiral de Bon explained the French system of patrols, and stated that he hoped to be able to increase the number of trawlers and destroyers available.Rear-Admiral Duff explained the British method and asked whether, if we were able io supply a mobile force of 12 trawlers to reinforce the patrols off Ushant whenthey were required, they could be based at Brest.Vice-Admiral de Bon agreed to this proposition, and said it would be better ,to base them at Abenvrach, and that he would supply pilots from Brest. -  :The Chief of Staff suggested that this force should be free to act whereverthesubmarines were reported to be. -    &apos;It was agreed that the officer in command of this force should keep complete control (of them and act in conjunction with the naval authorities at Brest.        , ;
Vice-Admiral de Bon explained the system they have adopted for all Frenchtraffic, coming from the south and west, to make Belle Isle, where a depot of pilots hasbeen established. In charge of a pilot, the ships then pass close along the coast toCherbourg, where the pilots are disembarked. He suggested that our ships might,also employ this route.11. Conferences in Mediterranean,It was agreed that more frequent conferences between the French, Italian, andBritish Admirals should take place in the Mediterranean, and Taranto was suggested as a suitable rendezvous for the purpose.
