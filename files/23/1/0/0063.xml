Submarines.1. THE First Sea Lord reported a doubtful action between asurface vessel and a submarine. He also stated that the losses fromsubmarines for the twenty-four hours ending at noon on the 10thFebruary were as follows : Merchant-ships attacked and sunk Armed vessels            ... ... ... 1Unarmed     ...          ... ... ... 2Neutrals      ...          ... ... ... 4Sailing vessels and trawlers ... ... british merchant-ships attacked and escaped  Armed ... ... ... ...       1The losses for the twenty-four hours ending at noon on the11th February were : Merchant-ships attacked and sunk-Armed vesselsUnarmedNeutralsSailing vessels and trawlersDamaged by a mineNil2Nil11In addition, one or twro mine-sweeping trawlers had been sunk by mines, and an armed transport had been unsuccessfully attacked by a submarine in bright moonlight.Raids.2. The First Sea Lord reported air raids on Ostend and Bruges.Publication of 3. The First Sea Lord reported that the French GovernmentShipping Losses.       had protested against the publication by us of mercantile losses.The Secretary explained that the. decision to allow publicationof this information had, he believed, been made by the late/Govern-ment on the ground that to withhold it might involve a panic, and,at any rate, would cause a loss of public confidence. The WarCabinet felt, however, that the present form of publication was unfortunate, as the newspapers, by means of Leadlines, created a false impression in regard to the extent of losses, particularly as these were published without relation to the number of shipsentering and sailing from British ports every day. They inclined to the view that it would be preferable to suppress the full particulars given in the present daily statements, which included the names of the ships and their tonnage information which couldnot fail to be of value to the enemy, and to assist him in the list of losses that he published.The Admiralty were asked to consider a new form of publicity in regard to casualties.The Western Front. 4, The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that theBritish losses in the recent successful operation on the Ancre, when205 prisoners had been taken, were only 150, of whom 130 werewounded.5. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported thatportions of two additional German Cavalry Divisions had been identified on the Western Front, making an ascertained total of two,and a possible total of four additional Cavalry Divisions brought
6. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that theAustrian Army on the Italian Front, having, as previously reported by him, been reinforced by two and a half Divisions, had attacked the Italians on Saturday, the 10th February, and had taken 1,000prisoners. The fighting- had, so far, gone slightly in favour of theenemy, but the Italians had ample forces on the spot.German Reserves. 7. The Chief of the imperial General Staff undertook to furnish tothe War Cabinet a Memorandum regarding the existing german military reserves in men.  &apos;8. In regard to the conveyance of iron ore overland from Spainto France (War Cabinet, 58, Minute 3), the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff stated that there was a break of gauge between theFrench and. Spanish railways on the West side on the Spanishfrontier. He undertook to make further enquiries into the matter ofthe possibility of rail transport, and, in conjunction with lord hardinge, to draw up a draft telegram to our Minister in Spain,asking if Spain is in a position to furnish the necessary rolling-stock to carry the ore to and from the frontier. He also undertook to ascertain whether France could provide rail transport from thefrontier.9. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff brought to thenotice of the War Cabinet a telegram from General Milne(Appendix I), and a letter of the 5th February to himself fromthe French Military Attache in London, dealing with the preciseinterpretation to be placed on the decision of the Rome Conferencein regard to the relations between General Sarrail and the Generalscommanding the forces of the different nationalities, as to whichrelations the British and French versions differed slightly. j the parallel records of the pertinent paragraph of the Rome conference are given in Appendix II.]The Secretary of State for War expressed dissent from theproposal to send a brigade to Petra. He considered that to do so would be to expose this brigade to grave risk, which might be avoided only by General Milne making a disposition of the force which was not in accordance with General Sarraif&apos;s orders, andwhich, if carried out contrary to those orders, would involve the brigade in operations in Greece outside the agreed theatre of war.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that, in view ofthe objections given by General Milne against sending the brigadeto Petra (with which he agreed), and of the fact that the menace ofa fresh attack was much less than it had been a few weekspreviously, he was of opinion that the brigade ought not to be sent.The War Cabinet decided that General Milne should comply with General Sarraif&apos;s order, andsend the Brigade to Petra ;but they directed the Secretary of State for War To write to General Lyautey to point out that, although theyhad instructed General Milne to carry out the order givenby General Sarrail, they desired at the same time to bring to the notice of General Lyautey that General Sarrail didIron Ore from spain.The Command salonika,over from the East daring the last two months. This was inaddition to five Divisions transferred across to the West during thesame period.
not appear to have given any reasons to General Milne forthe move, nor to have taken the latter into his confidence to the extent due to the size of the force commanded byGeneral Milne, and that they hoped he might give instructions accordingly.Prisoners of War: 10. In  reference to  the  Memorandum    by   the   Adjutant-Reprisals. General, dated the 6th February (Appendix III), the War cabinet authorised the War Office To take two German officer prisoners and treat them in exactly the same way as Captain Bate and Lieutenant Lamblewere being treated in Germany, i.e., to dress them in prison clothing and employ them in the usual tasks carriedout in prison.The War Cabinet further authorised That a communication that this had been done should be madeto the German Government through the NetherlandsMinister.Japan and 11. The-War Cabinet considered the question of the JapaneseShantung. claim to Shantung (War Cabinet, 51, Minute 6, and War Cabinet,54, Minute 6), in the light of telegram No. 60 of the 27th Januaryfrom Sir C. Greene, Tokyo (Appendix TV); the Memorandum by theForeign Office, &quot; The Japanese Claim to Inherit the German rights in Shantung,&quot; dated the 2nd February, 1917 ; and the Memorandumby the First Sea Lord &quot; Shantung Peninsula and Wei-Hai-Wei,&quot;dated the 6th February, 1917.After discussion of the possible difficulties that might be createdwith the United States and our Allies by our acceding to the requestof the Japanese Government, and the precise form which our reply should take, the War Cabinet decided that The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should give an assurance in the terms suggested in the opening sentences of the original Japanese request of &quot;the 27th January, withthe proviso that the Japanese Government should give acorresponding assurance of support, in the eventual peace settlement, to our claims to the German islands south ofthe Equator, and in our general policy elsewhere.Japanese request for assurances asregards the futureof the GermanIslands north ofthe Equator.12. The Secretary of State for the Colonies explained that therewas considerable anxiety in the Dominions lest the British Govern-ment should sacrifice the interests of the Dominions or give up theirconquests for purely European objects. He added that our OverseaDominions had no objection to the Japanese retaining theirconquests if it was made clear that we intended on our part toretain ours, and that they would be satisfied if the assurance given,to Japan safeguarded the British claim to the conquered Germanislands south of the Equator.
Southern Persia. 13. In reference to Minute 5 of the War Cabinet Meetingheld on the 25th January (War Cabinet, 44, Minute 5), the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff pointed out that the proposal for anofficer to be placed in command of all the military forces in SouthernPersia, including those at Bushire, acting under the Government ofIndia, originated with him, and that he regarded it as a measureessential to the adequate prevention of enemy attempts to stir uptrouble in Persia and on our Indian frontier. The Government ofIndia were of the same opinion, aud, apparently, so was His Majesty&apos;minister at Tehran. The Chief! of the Imperial General Staff addedthat, if the proposal were not adopted, confusion, delay, and consequent inability to deal effectively with possible hostile attemptswould certainly occur, if such attempts were made.In view of the nature of the reply received from the Governmentof India (Appendix V), and that from the British Minister atTehran to the request for their views as to the expediencyunder present conditions of entrusting the supervision of operations in Southern Persia to Sir Percy Sykes, the War cabinet decided that The existing- situation in Southern Persia, and the dangers which might be apprehended from German and Turkishintrigue in these regions, particularly in view of themilitary situation in Mesopotamia and Turkey-in-Asia, didnot call for the replacement of Sir Percy Sykes by aGeneral Officer to command all the forces in SouthernPersia, but that the situation would be adequately met bythe retention of Sir Percy Sykes as Political Officer, andby attaching to him as Military Adviser an officer with military experience. No control would be exercised bythis officer over the forces at Bushire, and Sir Percy Sykes&apos;relations to His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Tehran would remain unchanged.The Secretary of State for India to communicate this decisionto the Government of India, and the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to communicate it to the British Ministerat Tehran.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W., cFebruary 13, 1917.
Telegram from the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Salonica, to theChief of the Imperial General Staff.G.C.604.THE brigade at Katerini being urgently required on my front, I asked Sarrailthis morning if he had any objection to my bringing it back. To-night I received anorder to move the brigade to Petra, on the road to Elasona, and to hold the defile atthat place. To do this effectively, it will be necessary to hold the pass much further to the south-west. In accordance with the terms of 27875 cipher of the 13th Januaryfrom Secretary of State for War, I desire to protest against this order. The wholeline from the sea to the Vardar is being held by the British army, while Sarrail hasfifteen divisions west of the Vardar. I experience great difficulty in relieving mytroops in the front line, and shall have very great difficulty in feeding troops at Petra.I consider, moreover, that the sanction of His Majesty&apos;s Government is required for a move south, even within the neutral zone. As, since his return from the RomeConference, Sarrail gives me no information of his plans, I cannot understand what his intention is. Trusting that you will press for the return of British brigade fromKaterini, where it was sent when the French had no troops available and the situationseemed threatening. Three French divisions have arrived since that time. In myopinion, the situation on my front does not justify my only reserve being so far away,nor do I think that the move is necessitated by the situation in Greece. Trust I may receive an early reply.February 10, 1917.APPENDIX II.Extract from Paper I.C.-15, Conclusions of a Conference of the Allies held at theConsulte, Rome, on the bth, tith, and 1th January, 1917.La Corn-man&amp; Salonique.6.

Reprisals on Officers alleged to be in Possession of Soft-Nosed Bullets.Memorandum by the Adjutant-General.PATZEL, a German Feldwebel, was convicted by a Field General Court-Martialin the Cameroons in October 1915 for having hollow-nosed and cut bullets in his possession, and sentenced to death. This was commuted to twenty years&apos; penal servitude.He is serving his sentence at Maidstone.Germany called on us to revise these proceedings, as, according to the orders ofthe German officer in command of the Cameroon Forces, such bullets were only to beused for the purpose of killing game, and they put forward a statement made by arepatriated soldier who had been with Patzel, suggesting that these orders werestrictly carried out.To this we replied that the man had been rightly convicted.Germany returned to the charge, and, in the meantime, has imprisoned twoof our officers Captain Bate, Duke of Wellington^ Regiment, and LieutenantLamble, R.N.R. both of whom were taken prisoners on the &quot; Appam&quot; by the&quot;Moewe,&quot; in circumstances of great indignity. They have clothed them in the dressworn by German military prisoners and confined them in ordinary cells, where theyare employed in making sacks. Proceedings for having dum-dum bullets in theirluggage are threatened.I strongly urge that reprisals should be taken against two selected german officers to counteract the action taken by the Germans in regard to Captain Bate and lieutenant Lamble. In the case of Patzel, the hollow-nosed and cut bullets were inhis possession, whereas in the case of the two British officers, who were coming home from West Africa when captured by the &quot;Moewe,&quot; the bullets are said to have beenin their luggage ; but of that we have no proof. In any case, they had been serving in west Africa, and if these bullets were in their possession, the chances are that they hadthem for sporting purposes.I suggest that we should take two German officers and treat them in exactly thesame way as Captain Bate and Lieutenant Lamble are being treated, viz., put them in prison clothing and employ them on the usual prison tasks. Should the Germanstake proceedings against our officers for having dum-dum bullets in their luggage andsentence them to death, 1 suggest that we should tell them that, in the event of theofficers being executed, we shall execute the two German officers.Unless we take a firm line in regard to prisoners, I feel sure that our prisoners inGermany will only suffer more than at present, and the Germans will take every advantage of what they will consider our weakness rather than our humanity.(Initialled) C. F. M., A.-G.February 6, 1917.APPENDIX IV.Paraphrase of Telegram No. 60, dated the 27th January, from Sir C. Greene, Tokyo.SIR C. GREENE stated that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had referred tothe desire for naval assistance expressed by tlis Majesty&apos;s Government, and had saidthat it would be much easier for him to persuade the Cabinet and the Naval GeneralStaff to agree to our proposal for an extension of the sphere of Japanese naval helpif he were in a position to quote our willingness to give the assurance in question now ;his position in the Cabinet also would be strengthened, which would be advantageous to the Allies.From this it was evident that, as Sir C. Greene had foreseen, and as had been thecase in the spring of 1916, the Japanese wished to exploit our request for extendedco-operation in order to do a political deal with us.   At the same their request was not[1365-63] D
APPENDIX V.From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Army Department, January 25, 1917.3434. Your telegram 940 of 21st January. Immediate despatch of proposedreinforcements approved. Presumed that the officers and instructors mentioned were asked for by Sykes for Soiith Persian Rifles, and will be , required for that purposewhatever our decision as to military control and appointment of General may be.This question is reserved by War Cabinet for further consideration after receivingreplies from you and Marling to questions which will be sent in another telegram.From Secretary of State to Viceroy, January 30, 1917.3436. Your telegram No. 940 and Marling&apos;s telegram No. 30 of the 23rd January(situation in South-West Persia).War Cabinet -have again had question under consideration, especially withreference to the two above-mentioned telegrams.From such information as is in their possession they are not at present convincedthat there is grave or imminent danger of any strong Turkish advance into the interiorof Persia whereby situation in Fars would be seriously compromised in the nearfuture. They realise, however, that it is desirable that the position of the SouthPersian Rifles at Shiraz should be rendered more secure. For this purpose theGovernment of India have been instructed to send immediately the reinforcementsmentioned in the last paragraph of Viceroy&apos;s telegram, which will number approxi-mately 1,000 men together with the 10 officers and 53 British instructors, provided that sir P. Sykes desires and has asked for the latter for the training of the South PersianRifles.As regards the position of Sir P. Sykes, War Cabinet feel great hesitation insuperseding him by a General of the active Army : in the first place, he is an officerwith very exceptional knowledge of Persia, he is persona gratissima to the Governor-General of Fars and to Persians generally, while such a change would affectSir P. Sykes&apos; personal position so injuriously that it is hardly likely that he woulda new one. In December 1914 (Sir C. Greene&apos;s telegrams Nos. 242 and 261) they had made a similar claim regarding German islands north of the Equator, which was atpresent their chief interest in the division of the spoil ; presumably the only difference was that they ask for an assurance of our support at the present time instead of at theend of hostilities. To this end they instanced the precedent of Russia and Italy, and claimed like treatment for themselves.Sir C. Greene was unaware of the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government as to thefuture of the islands, or of the diplomatic and strategic problems which their eventualpossession of by Japan might raise with America or Australia. But, from the pointof view of our relations with Japan, he had been and was inclined to believe that weshould do well to give the desired assurance. Japan was practically in possession ofthe islands, and if she declined eventually to give them up we should either have touse force or to offer her some compensation, which might be more onerous thanacquiescence at the present time. Before her participation in the war Japan expectedsome reward, and the reversion of these islands would go far to meet this expectation.In the circumstances it seemed that, if His Majesty&apos;s Government could give the desired assurance at once, the relations between Japanese Government and themselves would be strengthened, as well as the position of the Minister for Foreign Affairshimself, who was anxious to help the Allied cause.He could not believe that the Japanese Government would hesitate to grant naval assistance, but it would make all the difference if this were to be granted in response to a friendly action on our part, not merely as a transaction on a pecuniary basis.He thought that we might accompany our assurance by the expression of a hopethat our acquiescence might lead to the whole-hearted participation of Japan in theirnaval and wider field of co-operation. In such a case he imagined that the JapaneseGovernment would hardly insist upon the money demand alluded to in his telegramNo. 40.
From Viceroy, Army Department, February 6. 1917.(Repeated to Tehran.)1765. Please see your telegram 3436 of 30th January and Marling&apos;s 43 of 31stJanuary, 1917, to Foreign Office, London.Whilst agreeing that there is at present no imminent danger of a hostile advancethrough Persia, we made our proposals with a view to safeguarding ourselves in themost efficient manner against the possibility of such a movement At the same time,in your 3431, you stated that the War Cabinet were of opinion that operations aroundShiraz had assumed a military character. We agree in this view, which is fullyconfirmed by current events. On the suggestion of the War Cabinet, we proposed the command being exercised by a military officer appointed by us who, in view of theresponsibility involved, should undoubtedly hold Generals rank.We recognise Sykes&apos; political qualifications, and we consider that he conducted his mission successfully up to the date of his arrival at Shiraz. But, having regard topresent circumstances, we think that his military knowledge is not sufficient to enable us to rely upon him to deal acleq^rately with the local military situation. We must addas regards organisation of the South Persian Rifles, which in our opinion is the mostimportant factor in the maintenance of our position in Southern Persia, Sykes hasshown a lack of organising capacity which prevents us from proposing his retention.We recognise that Sykes might not like the position of Chief Political Officer, and itwas for this reason that we suggested Gough as his successor. We agree that Persiansusceptibilities should be disturbed as little as possible, but we feel strongly that the necessities of the military position are paramount, and that we require a free hand tocontrol this force for which we are now paying, and which is intended for the protectionof Persian interests and the maintenance of Persian authority.As this force is dependent on India for reinforcements, supplies, and munitions,dual control seems to us unavoidable unless we also control its operations, and in our940 of 20th January we emphasised the importance of avoiding anything in the natureof dual control.consent to remain as Chief Political Officer to the General in question ; and secondly,such an appointment might, they feel, give to the South Persian Rifles, and, indeed,the whole situation, a militar- appearance, which might justly excite the suspicions ofthe Persian Government and constitute a perhaps inconvenient: precedent for similar action elsewhere. The above might perhaps hold good were we to insist on theappointment of a General even nominally under Persian control.I should be glad to know your views upon preceding considerations.Note. Similar telegram addressed by Foreign Office to Sir C. Marling, Tehran,as No. 35 of 29th January, 1917.
