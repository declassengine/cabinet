The War Cabinet at two meetings held on Wednesday, theOutrages. 13th December, had under consideration the policy to be adoptedin order to prevent, if possible, the execution of Captain Blaikie, ofthe armed transport &quot; Caledonia,&quot; which was reported to be threatened by the enemy.2. At the first meeting the First Sea Lord of the Admiraltypointed out that this officer had acted within his rights. Accordingto the report from the Vice-Admiral Commanding the eastern mediterranean, Captain Blaikie had observed a submarine ahead of him endeavouring to take up a position to fire a torpedo. Thesubmarine fired first, and Captain Blaikie subsequently tried to ramher in self-defence, which was a perfectly legitimate manoeuvre.Admiral Sir John Jeliicoe thought it possible that when thesecircumstances were brought to light the enemy would not proceedto extremes. He reported that the question had been considered bythe Board of Admiralty, who held that any retaliation for theexecution of Captain Blaikie, if the latter were, carried, out, should* This discussion was commenced at the Fourth Meeting held at noon on the same day.[1365-6] . - -.......
2take the form of attacks by aircraft on open towns, a form of operation to which we had not hitherto resorted.3. At the second meeting the First Sea Lord read out the Minuteon this subject prepared by the Board of Admiralty at a meetingheld that afternoon.   (Appendix I.)4. After discussion the War Cabinet agreed to be guided by thefollowing principles : (1.) That every effort should be made by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to save Captain Blaikie.(2.) That His Majesty&apos;s Government should threaten definitereprisals in the event of Captain Blaikie being executed,without stating what form these reprisals would take.(3.) That if any threat of reprisals were made the threat shouldbe carried out in the event of the emergency arising.(4.) That it was unnecessary to delay the issue of the threatuntil the nature of the reprisals to be taken was settled,this being a matter for subsequent discussion.5. In this latter connection the forms .of reprisals discussedincluded : (a.) The execution of some prisoner now in our hands. Thisproposal was rejected.(6.) The execution of the first enemy submarine officer captured.Several objections were urged against this course. Itwas pointed out that the next naval officer capturedmight be merely carrying out his lawful duty, and might even be captured in the performance of an act ofgallantry, and his execution might outrage publicopinion. This course might also lead to a rivalry in theexecution of prisoners, in which the more civilizednation must inevitably lose.(c.) Aircraft raids on open towns as advocated by the Board ofAdmiralty.6. The War Cabinet decided that the Foreign Secretary, inconsultation with the First Sea Lord, should at once draft and sendtwo communications on the subject to the Ambassador of the UnitedStates of America in London : (a.) The first should be for communication to the GermanGovernment, to the effect that the execution of CaptainBlaikie would be regarded as a cold-blooded murder anda crime against humanity, which would be visited bythe British Government with immediate reprisals.(6.) The second would explain the details of the matter for theinformation of the Government of the United States ofAmerica.7. The War Cabinet also decided that the Admiralty couldpublish the real facts of the case later on ; that for the presentnothing was to be communicated to the press; and that if anyquestion were raised in Parliament the reply should be in the sense that the Government was taking all possible steps in the matter.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,December 14, 1916.
Gopy of Board Minute by the Board of Admiralty, datedDecember 13, 1916.THE Board of Admiralty is of opinion that the proposedreprisals for the murder of Captain Blaikie if the murder is carriedout should be confined to the shooting of a German submarineofficer captured after the event, and that the intimation of theintention should, be coupled with a statement that, should this leadto further reprisals on the part of Germany, the British Governmentreserves to itself free liberty of action. The Board hold a strongconviction that no threat of this nature should be made unless it isdefinitely intended to carry it out.The Board considers that the whole question should be at oncetaken up of arriving at some agreement with Germany as to the suspension of the execution of death sentences until after the war onthe same lines as the agreement which it is understood has been arrived at between Germany and France, except that it is to includesimilar cases to that under consideration.printed at the foreign office by 0. k. haekison 16/12/1916j
