Shipbuilding Advisory Committee on the present situation in regardto shipbuilding, and the measures to be taken to accelerate theoutput, more particularly in regard to the proposals contained intwo papers : (a.) A memorandum by the Shipping Controller on the adoptionof a system of Payment by Results : (Appendix I); and(6.) A note by the Merchant Shipbuilding Advisory Committeeto the Shipping Controller : (Appendix II).The Minister of Labour reported that, from actual experience and from special enquiries made, it was clear that among workmenthere was a general suspicion and dislike of the system of premiumbonus. It was generally agreed that it would be necessary, what-ever system of Payment by Results was adopted, to convince themen that it would be honestly administered, that material would be forthcoming to the best workers, and that the introduction ofdilution would not operate unjustly to reduce the earnings of skilled workers.
The Minister of Pensions stated that, some time ago, at Carlisle,after a system of Payment by Results bad been introduced, com-plaints were so general that, there must have been some truth inregard to the abuses. At the same time, he agreed that during thewar, a system of Payment by Results is desirable.Mr. Rowan Thomson, a member of the Advisory Committee,gave an outline of the Rowan Premium Piece-Work System, whichhad been in successful operation for eighteen years, which is designed to remove from the employer the temptation to cut time-rates. Under this system, a workman is told that if he can do acertain piece of work, for which the time is fixed at 100 hours, in80 hours (or 20 per cent, less), he will be paid 20 per cent, more money. If he does it in 60 hours, he gets 40 per cent, extra wages.Mr. Thomson claimed that the output of his machine shops is increased by this system to anything from 30 to 40 per cent., andthat the cost of production is reduced.The Minister of Munitions reported that the experience of theMinistry was in favour of Payment by Results. Their information,however, pointed to (a.) A waste of men in the shipyards who were not fully occupied ; and(6.) A lack of mobility of labour.He thought that the workmen should have a guarantee as tothe fixing of time, if some such scheme as Mr. Thomsons is adopted,and also that they should get the full fruits of their labour in thespeeding up of their work  the War Cabinet, decided that (1.) The principle of Payment by Results should be adopted asa War Measure.(2.) The system should be applied to all branches of the shipbuilding industry where applicable.(3.) The Minister of Labour sKould bring a deputation fromthe Trades Unions concerned on Tuesday, the 6th february-ary, 1917, at 3 p.m., to see the Prime Minister, whowill point out that it is in the nation&apos;s interest that asystem of Payment by Results should be adopted.(4.) Local option fshould be given as to the particular system to be adopted.(5 ) There should be a time-limit for its introduction.2. The Shipping Controller pointed out that it was vitally necessary to have a larger percentage of material for mercantilework. At present the Navy has 60 per cent, of the material. he asked the War Cabinet to decide what percentage should be-allocated to the mercantile marine and what to the Admiralty.The War Cabinet decided that: The Third Sea Lord should arrange a conference at which theAdmiralty, the War Office, the Ministry of Munitions, andthe Shipping Controller should be represented to formulatea plan and report to the War Cabinet.(Initialled) D.

Labour in shipbuilding yards and marine engine shops with special reference to theeffect of the system of payment by results.Memorandum by the Shipping Controller.IN view of the supreme importance at the present time of utilising to the utmostthe resources of the shipbuilding yards and marine engine shops of the country,inquiry has been made into the effect upon output of the &quot;substitution of the system of payment by results, whether in the form of piece rates or of the premium bonusarrangement, for the system of time rates.The customary method of payment of shipwrights is by time ; and, owing doubtlessto the varying nature of the shipwrights&apos; duties, the substitution of the piece-ratesystem has been attended by greater difficulty than in other trades. Even to-day,notwithstanding the recognition by both masters and men of the urgent need forincreased output, and though abundant experience is available of the advantages fromthis point of view of a system of remuneration varying with output, payment by results has only been introduced to a comparatively small extent. But in those cases in which it has been adopted results of a most striking character have followed.Examples:(a.) Red-leaders working on the tanks of a submarine did in 2,634 hours an amountof work which took them 4,528 hours on a duplicate submarine whenworking on time.(6.) Certain brassfmishers&apos; work done on time took 6,113 hours, but on the premiumbonus system was done in 3,533 hours,(c.) Certain shipyard mechanics&apos; work took on time 7,910 hours, as against 4,299hours on premium bonus.(d.) Sheet-iron work which took 972 hours when men were on time rates, took only584 hours on piece rates,(e.) A certain piece of work performed on an enhanced time rate took 20,674 hours ;similar work at piece rates took only 12,050 hours a saving of 8,624hours.(/.) On introduction of the premium bonus system 521 men did in one week anamount of work which it had previously taken 980 men to do. Incidentallythis had the effect of practically doubling the machine plant.The foregoing cases are outstanding examples, and the saving resulting from theabolition of time rates may not always be so great as is there shown. But it is beyonddispute that resxdts such as the figures indicate can only be obtained if the men are working on a system of payment which gives them increased remuneration for theirincreased output.The Controller of Shipping is convinced, therefore, that in the existing grave emergency the universal substitution of payment by results for time rates in ship-building yards and marine engine shops is a reform most urgently needed in thenational interest.January 26, 1917.
The Merchant Shipbuilding Advisory Committee to the Shipping Controller.I.IT is understood : (a.) That no men are to be released from the Colours whether serving abroad, athome, or in the reserve for shipbuilding and marine engineering.(b.) That no men, skilled or unskilled, are to be taken from shipbuilding and marine engineering for service with the Colours or any other purpose.PL .In these circumstances, in order to obtain the greatest possible output fromshipyards and marine engine shops, it is suggested : ?.-. (a.) That a compulsory order should be issued making it obligatory upon both employers and workmen to adopt systems of payment by result whereverthese are practicable and time-work is now the rale.(6.) That, in the event of payment by result being asked for by employers orworkmen and a mutual agreement has not been arrived at within fourteenclays, the matter should be immediately referred to the Director ofShipyard Labour, who acting with two technical assessors should forthwith hear the parties interested, and give a decision which shall be binding on all parties. Pending a decision there shall be no stoppage ofwork.(c.) That, as regards time-keeping and discipline, power should be vested inCrown Officials to investigate complaints, and to deal summarily withpersistent offenders.(d.) That refusal to work labour-saving appliances should be made an offence against the Defence of the Realm Regulations.January 26, 1917.
