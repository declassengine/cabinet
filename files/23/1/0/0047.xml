In reference to the decision of the War Cabinet held on the24th January, 1917 (War Cabinet, 43, Minute 5), that GeneralPhillips should be sent to Larissa at once, unless General Sarrailobjected to this course, the (&apos;chief of the Imperial General Staffinformed the War Cabinet that General Cauboue, the head of theAllied Control Commission in Greece, had instructed GeneralPhillips to remain in Athens General Phillips had reported that, inhis opinion, the Greeks were doing their best to carry out whatthey had undertaken, but the French would not believe that theycould do anything right. On the other hand, he regarded theReservists, who were armed, as a potential danger in Thessaly.Captain Cockerell had reported all quiet at Larissa, that theevacuation was proceeding, and that in eight days&apos; time all theGreek war material would have been evacuated, provided that adequate rolling-stock was available. An accumulation of Greekwar material was reported at Vol$ ready for transport by sea, and nearly all the guns known to have previously been in Thessalyhad reached the Morea. In view of the above information, the WarCabinet decided that: General Milne should be given full discretion as to GeneralPhillips&apos; movements.Relaxation of 8. In view  of   the   satisfactory   information regarding  theBlockade. evacuation of Thessaly ;  the absence of any indications that theCentral Powers were concentrating against the Salonica front; andthe indications of the existence of severe stress in Greece, the WarCabinet decided that: Subject to the agreement of the French Government, some relaxation in the blockade should be permitted, and that astrict system of rationing should be substituted, whereby the Greeks should be given sufficient supplies to meet their requirements from day to day.The Foreign Office to take the necessary action. m &apos;
Japan and theGerman Islands in.the Pacific:Naval co-operation.9. In reference to telegrams from the British Minister at Tokyo,Nos. 59 and 60, dated 27th January, regarding the ultimate disposalof the captured German islands north of the equator, the WarCabinet, while recognising the importance of giving the JapaneseGovernment an early assurance on the subject, with a view to obtaining further Naval co-operation from Japan, decided : To await the Interim Report of Sir Louis Mallet&apos;s Committee onTerritorial Changes, which should be expedited with theobject mentioned.The Labour party conference.10. Mr. Henderson reported the proceedings at the Conferenceof the Labour party. He explained that, with regard to the deportation of Kirkwood and other Clyde strikers, the conference had decided to appoint a committee to investigate the charges madeby Kirkwood as to his action in the matter.11. The War Cabinet were informed that Kirkwood had returned to Glasgow.   They decided that: So soon as the statement referred to in Minute 12 was ready for publication, Kirkwood should be approached andconfronted with his own declaration at the time of hisarrest, i.e , that, he preferred to be deported rather thantried ; that he should then be given an opportunity ofsigning the undertaking as to good behaviour already accepted by certain of tbe deportees, and, if he refused,should be deported forthwdth ; and that if he subsequentlyapplied for permission to go to Glasgow in order to collectevidence for the Committee as to his connection with thelabour troubles on the Clyde the application should be favourably considered.12. The War Cabinet decided that The Minister of Munitions should prepare a statement on thesubject of Kirkwood, to be published in the event of hisapprehension. The statement should make it clear thatKirkwood was re-arrested for breach of the Order underwhich he wras deported ; that at the time when the order was originally made he had voluntarily accepted deportationas an alternative to trial ; and that he might return to Glasgow at any time on signing the undertaking.The speakers conference.13.

Holland:Entry of ArmedMerchantmen intoDutch Pbrts.15. The First Lord of the Admiralty raised the question as towhether any action should be taken by us with regard to ftherefusal of the Dutch Government to allow our armed merchantmento enter their ports.   The War Cabinet decided that-It was not desirable to take any action at the present stage,no admission having been made by us that we recognised&apos;as correct the attitude of the Dutch. Government in regardto this breach of International Law.Loss of the&quot; Laurentic.&quot;16. &quot;In reference to the report made at the Meeting of the WarCabinet held on the 26th January, 1917 (War Cabinet, 46, Minute 2),the First Sea Lord reported that the &quot;Laurentic&quot; sank in about25 fathoms, and that it was therefore doubtful whether we shouldbe able to recover the gold.Norway:Export of Pyrites.17.

In reference to the decision taken at the Meeting of theTerritorial Waters. War Cabinet held on the Snth December, 1916 (War Cabinet, 23,Minute lb;, the First Lord of the Admiralty reported that theCommander-in-Chief of the Grand Fleet laid great stress on thedifficulty of preventing the escape of German raiders owing to the opportunities afforded the enemy by the use of Norwegian territorial waters for the purpose of eluding his patrols. In view of the danger to British interests which would be involved in any general violalionof territorial waters, for example, in Spain or in Sweden, the WarCabinet decided that It would not be in our interests to take ]the initiative by anyviolation of Norwegian neutrality.The GermanRaider.20. The First Sea Lord reported that one of our merchant ships had been sunk, either by a mine or an internal explosion, off CapeTown.   It was thought that mines might have been laid in that
vicinity by the German raider, which, it was anticipated, might nowbe en route to Indian waters. He further stated that steps had beentaken to augment, as far as possible, our naval force in thosewaters. A Swedish ship, boarded in the vicinity of the Cape ofGood Hope, also under suspicion of having laid mines, had been detained and was being carefully searched.Russia: 21. The First Sea Lord drew attention to a report as to theKailways. serious congestion on the Russian Railways (Appendix I).    TheWar Cabinet decided that-The question should be brought up as soon as Mr. Bury arrived,when he was to be requested, by the Private Secretary tothe Prime Minister, to see the First Sea Lord, who wouldgive him all the information in his possession (see WarCabinet, 38, Minute I).The Dardanelles 22. The Secretary reported to the War Cabinet that he hadCommission. more than once been approached by the Dardanelles Commission toprepare lull evidence for the Commission on the same lines as that given by him at the outset of the inquiry. The preparation of thisoriginal evidence, dealing with the origin and initiation of theDardanelles enterprise, had involved the Secretary in some170 hours&apos; work, and he anticipated that the preparation ofevidence of the same- kind, in regard to the later stages of theDardanelles operations, would be no less arduous. Up to thepresent time he had not felt justified in devoting his time tothe preparation of further evidence, in view of the exacting natureof his duties as Secretary of the War Cabinet.The Secretary further reported that he had just received aletter from the Secretary of the Dardanelles Commission statingthat the Commission very much regretted that he could not come before them, but appreciated the reason ; and that, in their opinion,it was absolutely essential for them to have the extracts from theSecretary&apos;s Minutes of the War Council and Dardanelles committee at the point where he broke off his evidence down to the day oi thefinal evacuation.The War Cabinet decided that: The duties of the Secretary of the War Cabinet do not, atpresent, permit of his preparing further evidence for theDardanelles Commission. Further, the War Cabinet didnot feel justified in reversing the carefully considereddecision of the former War Committee on the 25thSeptember, 1916 (War Cabinet, 70, Conclusion 8, repro-duced in Appendix II), that access to the proceedings ofthe War Council and Dardanelles Committee should belimited to the Chairman of the Dardanelles Commission-.They instructed the Secretary to reply to the dardanelles commission in this sense.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,January 29, 1917.
Copy of a Telegram from the Divisional Naval Transport Officer at Romanoffto Admiraltyt dated the 28th January, 1917.77. RAILWAY started the 14th January, despatched ten waggons from&quot;Hansley&quot; [?]. I understand no more munitions are going forward for ten days. can get nothing official from Russians, but do not rely on railway when working to take any more than fifty waggons per day. Shore labour consists of lowest class [? j soldier,and they will never load any more than fifty, even [?] if railway can carry more. Atpresent Russians will not put munition ships into [? i berth, because they know theycannot deal with them. One [?] berth occupied by collier discharging port side[?] soldiers 25 tons per day, and I understand 12,000 tons have to be landed.Another berth occupied by icebreaker bunkering at about same rate. Third [?] berthoccupied by &quot; Hansley &quot; discharging about 250 tons per twenty-four hours, workingtwo hatches. This is as much as they can handle at present, 20 per cent, of Martens&apos;labourers are sick, owing to bad accomodation. I am now arranging to [?] berth someon &quot; Nigeria.&quot; Russians will do nothing in the matter. Unless very energetic measuresbe taken with high authorities, the landing and forwarding of munitions from here will be very small.(Addressed to Admiralty, London, and repeated to S.N.O., Archangel.)APPENDIX II.Extract from the Proceedings of a Meeting of the War Committee held on Monday,September 25, 1916.The Dardanelles &quot; 8. The War Committee had under considered  &apos;ation a requestf romCommission. the Dardanelles Commission that the Secretary&apos;s Notes of the WarCouncil, which existed from November 1914 to May 1915, shouldbe placed at iheir disposal. These Notes were kept in manuscriptat considerable length, and were not passed round to members for confirmation, and consequently only form the Secretary&apos;s uncon-firmed impressions of what occurred at each meeting. The war committee felt strongly that in these circumstances the Notes couldnot be regarded as valuable evidence; they reported conversations which took place in the most secrtt possible conditions, and notwith a view to their ultimate communication to a judicial body;and their presentation to the Dardanelles Commission might,therefore, not only cause injustice to individuals, but might beregarded as compromising, to a certain extent, the whole principleof the collective responsibidty of the Cabinet. The Committeewere also informed that, all material points of the Secretary&apos;s Noteshad already been embodied in the evidence given by him to theDardanelles Commission.&quot; On the other hand, the view was expressed that it was im-portant not to give the Dardanelles Commission any ground to entertain the view that any information had been held back, andthat a very difficult Parliamentary situation might arise if the Noteswere altogether withheld.&quot; In these circumstances, the Committee authorised the Secre-tary to inform the Dardanelles Commission that the Chairman wouldbe given access to the Secretary&apos;s Notes of the War Councils pro-ceedings, in order to satisfy himself that nothing had been keptback, or to draw the attention of his Commission to any matter which he considered material, and which was not already includedin the evidence of the Secretary of the Committee of ImperialDefence.&quot;
