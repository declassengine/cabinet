THE First Sea Lord undertook to furnish the War cabinet with particulars as to the number of ships entering and clearingfrom British ports weekly, with a view to an estimate of the pro-portion of losses by enemy action, and, further, with a view to publication, if desirable.Shipping on Great 2 The War Cabinet discussed the possibility of securing theLakes. &quot; use 0f some 0f the shipping on the Great Lakes of North America.They realised that only small vessels of under 1,500 tons could get out through the canals to the sea, and that the utilisation of these would not in ordinary times be a commercial proposition. But, mview of the present emergency, they considered that real assistance might perhaps be afforded in this way, and directed the Secretaryto invite the Shipping Controller to investigate the matter further.Indo-RussianEailwayCommunication.3. The War Cabinet discussed the possibility of prolonging theQuetta-Nushki Railway, recently extended to Dalbandin (War Com-mittee 62, Conclusion 4), for another 400 miles in^ order to make ajunction with the Russian railway system. Having regard to thegreat importance of improving communications for supplies toRussia in the event of a considerable prolongation of the war, the
War Cabinet considered that the subject deserved examination, inspite of the strong objections which, on political and strategicalgrounds, have hitherto guided the British and Indian governments in their attitude towards similar proposals.The War Cabinet instructed the Secretary to communicate withthe Secretary of State for India in regard to the expediency of investigating the suggested scheme further, and of ascertaining how long it would take to complete a junctionof the two railway systems, and how far this new routecould be utilised to supply Russia.4. In continuation of the preliminary discussion at the morning&apos;smeeting, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs communicated atelegram from Sir Francis Elliot, No. 425, dated the 15th February(Appendix 1), dealing with the threatening tone of the Greek press and the apprehension felt in Athens of another outbreak on thelines of the one which took place on the 2nd December (WarCabinet; 68, Minute 6). Mr. Balfour suggested that the GreekGovernment should be informed that, in the event of a repetition ofthe scenes of the 2nd December, the Allied Governments would regard themselves as freed from all engagements made by them tothe Greek Government, and, unless the King and his Governmentcould secure the peaceful and constitutional administration ofGreeee, the Guaranteeing Powers would shape their policyaccordingly.The Director of Military Intelligence read out a report fromGeneral Phillips, forwarded by General Milne (Appendix II), statingthat there were two lines of thought in Athens with regard to thesituation in Greece : the first, that a large number of Reservists,hidden rifles, and ammunition still remain north of the Gulf ofCorinth, and that the danger is so great that an immediate occupa-tion of Thessaly is imperative; the other, that the Greek Army isinnocuous, and that, in spite of petty attempts on the part of theGeneral Staff to go behind the Agreement with the GreekGovernment, and the provocative attitude of the press, there is no real intention on the part of the Greeks to commit any act whichwould give the Allied Powers justification for establishing an activemilitary control.These divergent views are held so strongly that reasonableargument between their defenders is almost impossible. It was generally felt by the War Cabinet that, while drastic measures would have to be taken if there were any repetition of recentincidents, the British Government should not let itself be rushed bythe French into such measures in the absence of real provocation.The War Cabinet decided that The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should instruct sir Francis Elliot to considt with his colleagues in Athens,and hold a serious conversation with the Greek PrimeMinister in the sense of the proposed intimation.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,February 17, 19.17.(Initialled)      D.

Paraphrase of Telegram No. 425, dated Fabruary, 15, 1917, from Sir F. Elliot.THE Royalist press has lately contained frequent hints to the effect that trouble was brewing, and individual Reservists have threatened another 2nd December comingoff at an early date, when the Venizelists would be finally suppressed. The result isthat, in Athens to-day, there is almost panic. Sunday, the 18th February, is stated tobe the date when the new movement is to begin. Yesterday, about sixteen personscame individ ually to the legation to communicate this information and to secure advice.Several have already removed themselves for safety to the piraeus. Excitement hasbeen again inflamed in the press by a statement to the effect that the Governmentauthorities have become informed of the scheme for a landing of the insurgents at thePiraeus, and that they have taken the necessary measures to stop it. This story ismanifestly absurd, but it may be used as a pretext for bloodshed. The french admiral has informed the French Minister that, in the event of any disturbance inAthens, he intends on this occasion to bombard the city. This proposal is open to the obvious disadvantage that, however accurate may be the fire on particular points, itwill not be possible, even by giving due warning, to ensure the safety of neutral subjects and legations, or to prevent unfortunate accidents. It seems to me that a better course to adopt would be to warn the Government to insist on their publicly announcing that,should there be any repetition of the occurrence of the 2nd December last, the AlliedGovernments will consider themselves as no longer bound by their engagement not topermit the Venizelists to occupy parts of. Greece which are still in possession of theGreek authorities. My intention is to interview the Prime Minister to-morrow, and totell him that I have telegraphed to you suggesting the adoption of the above course.If you approve, kindly time your reply to reach me before I see him on the17th instant.(Sent to the Foreign Office and repeated to the Vice-Adrniral and Lord Granville).APPENDIX IL&quot;jf Telegram No. G.G. 521, dated February 15, 1917, from G.O.C. and G, Salonica,to G.I.G.S.AS regards the present situation in Greece, there are to-day in Athens two linesof thought: The first is that, although the Greek Army has been removed to Morea,a large number of Reservists, ammunition, and hidden rifles still remain north of theGulf of Corinth. The second is that the Greek Army is harmless, and that there is no intention of attempting any serious action against the Allied Army, nor is there any real cohesion between the Reservists and the Royalists. Those who accept the firsttheory consider that the peril is so real that an immediate occupation of Thessaly bythe Allies offers the only solution. Those who adhere to the second theory admit that german propaganda is very strong, as is the belief of the Royalists in ultimate Germanvictory, which belief is also shared by the Greek General Staff. They regard, however,the report as to the number of rifles concealed as enormously exaggerated. Theycannot see that any real damage can be done by bands which lack organisation,cohesion, machine guns, artillery, and transport. Lastly, their conviction is that the greeks will do nothing of a definite nature which would justify the Entente Powers in establishing an active military control. These widely divergent views are so strongly held that it is practically impossible to induce any modification or to get either side to listen to reasonable argument. Both sides receive an endless stream of reports ofagents, as well as the propaganda of the Germans, French, and Italians. It is hardly possible to credit the deliberately provocative attitude of the press and the deception andpetty cunning of the 5,000 officials. It would appear that the Greek Government have attempted to carry out the terms of the ultimatum, but the General Staff have left on
stone unturned to render the aims of that agreement abortive. The Greek Govern-ment are still attempting to rule, but without any success. We must continue to paycareful attention to the propaganda of the Germans, to the lack of discipline of theReservists, to the hostile action of the leaders of the Reservists and the unfriendlyattitude of the press, and also to the want of control by the Government. It is possiblethat the reports we receive from agents and Control Officers are alarmist, but inGeneral Phillips&apos;s view the Greeks will not commit any definite act against the Allies,although it is possible that instances may occur which the French will claim to justifymilitary interference.o
