Lb&apos; G.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,February 17, 1917.APPENDIX I.Copy of Telegrams sent by the Prime Minister to the Lord Provost of Edinburgh andLord Mayor of Manchester, dated 17th February, 1917,THE difficulties which have arisen in certain districts in connection with theoperation of the Potatoes, 1916, Main Crop (Prices) Order of the 1st instant havebeen considered by the War Cabinet.   The order was made by the Food Controller toensure that, in the interest of the consumer, the price should not be unduly inflated[1365-72]
in consequence of the shortage of supplies. The recent prolonged frost has reduced the available stocks and interrupted their regular distribution. It has accordinglyheen necessary to readjust as fairly as possible the interests of all parties. TheDepartments concerned have, therefore, at my request, met and conferred withrepresentatives of the wholesale and retail trades, and have submitted the following proposals, which have been approved by the War Cabinet: The price which the growers will he entitled to charge to dealers and merchantsfor potatoes delivered after the present date up to the 31st March will be9Z. per ton, free on rail or free on board. After that date the correspondingprice will be 101.The price at which the growers or any other person may sell to the retailer will,        be 101. 10s. until the . 31st March, and HZ. 10s. thereafter, in addition tothe cost of carriage.The price which the retailer may charge will be l^d. per pound up to the 31stMarch and Ifd. per pound thereafter to the end of June.
