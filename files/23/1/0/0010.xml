The Question ofthe allied conference.The Nature ofthe Reply.The nature of thestatement inParliament.Russia and constantinople.The War Cabinet discussed the question mainly from three points of view, namely : (1.) Whether a Conference of the Allies should be held toconsider the nature of the reply.(2.) The War Cabinet&apos;s ideas as to the nature of the properreply. &apos;(3.) The nature of the statements to be made in Parliament inconnection with this subject.2. In favour of an Allied Conference to consider the reply toGermany, it was pointed out as important for the Governments tobe able to show, both to neutrals and their own peoples, that theGerman offer had been seriously considered and not contemptuouslyput aside. It was generally agreed that it would be bad policy to dismiss the proposal without examination, even though it were believed to be disingenuous. On the other hand, there were strong arguments against the holding of a Conference. A conference would tend to give the impression that the Allies were examining the question in detail, and were considering counter-proposals. Itwould probably have the effect of producing a wrong atmosphere inregard to the war in the Allied countries, and might raise false hopes.When it turned out that the Conference had only met to dismiss theproposals, or to invite the Germans to make further proposals, therewould be a reaction. Moreover, it was not desirable to hold a seriesof Conferences. If the German overtures now under considerationwere followed by serious offers, the Conference would have to re-assemble. Finally, it was believed that no difficulty would be met with in arranging an answer which all the Allied Governments couldwithout a Conference.On a review of these considerations the War Cabinet decided- that the best plan would be for the Allies to concert anidentic note, which should be signed by the representatives,in Paris, of all the Allies, including the minor States, and handed by the representative of France, in the presence ofhis colleagues, to the American Ambassador in Paris.agree to3.

Communicated by American Ambassador.&quot; Mr. Charge d&apos;Affaires, Berlin, December 12, 1916.&quot;THE most formidable war known to history has been ravaging for two and a half years a great part of the world. That catastrophe that the bonds of a commoncivilisation more than a thousand years old could not stop, strikes mankind in its mostprecious patrimony ; it threatens to bury under its ruins the moral and physicalprogress on which Europe prided itself at the dawn of the twentieth century. In thatstrife Germany and her Allies, Austria-Hungary and Turkey, have given proof of theirindestructible strength in winning considerable successes at war. Their unshakablelines resist ceaseless attacks of their enemies&apos; arms. The recent diversion in the balkans was speedily and victoriously thwarted. The latest events have demonstrated that a continuation of the war cannot break their resisting power. The generalsituation much rather justified [sic] their hope of fresh successes. It was for thedefence of their existence and freedom of their national development that the fourAllied Powers were constrained to take up arms. The exploits of their armies have brought no change therein. Not for an instant have they swerved from the conviction thatthe respect of the rights of other nations is not in any degree incompatible with their ownrights and legitimate interests. They do not seek to crush or annihilate their adversaries.Conscious of their military and economic strength and ready to carry on to the end ifthey must the struggle that is forced upon them, but animated at the same time by thedesire to stem the flood of blood and to bring the horrors of war to an end, the fourallied Powers propose to enter even now into peace negotiations. They feel sure thatthe propositions which they would bring forward and which would aim to assure theexistence, honour, and free development of their peoples would be such as to serve asa basis for the restoration of a lasting peace.&quot; If, notwithstanding this offer of peace and conciliation the struggle shouldcontinue, the four allied Powers are resolved to carry it on to an end, while solemnlydisclaiming any responsibility before mankind and history.&quot; The Imperial Government has the honour to ask through your obliging medium,the Government of the United States, to be pleased to transmit the present communi-cation to the Government of the French Republic, to the Royal Government of GreatBritain, to the Imperial Government of Japan, to the Royal Government of Roumania,to the Imperial Government of Russia, and to the Royal Government of Serbia.&quot; I take this opportunity to renew to you, Mr. Charge d&apos;Affaires, the assurance ofmy high consideration.(Signed) &quot; Von Bethmann-Hollweg.&quot; To Mr. Joseph Clark Grew,Charge dAffaires of the United States of America.&quot;APPENDIX n.Reply of the Allies to German Peace Proposals.Collation of Various Suggestions as to Reply.(A.) Allies.I. Russia.Petrograd, Tel. M. Neratof thinks that Allies must be careful not to play intoNo. 1885, Dec. 13. Germany&apos;s hands, i.e., refuse flatly. There should be an exchangeof views, and he suggests that the answer should be that Germanyprovoked the war, and, although she is in possession of much Alliedterritory, the Allies are by no means beaten, and that they mean toimpose their own terms and obtain adequate guarantees for thefuture.
Petrograd, Tel.No. 1897, Dec. 15.Rome, Tel.No. 1202, Dec. 14.Havre, Tel.No. 92, Dec. 15.Tokyo, Tel.No. 685, Dec. 14.M. Neratof also thinks that, in order to save time, discussion asto terms of reply should take place at London or Paris.Count Benckendorff is of opinion that the reply should be thatan offer of peace in the air is insincere and cannot be made thebasis for discussion. He agrees that it should be made quite clearthat His Majesty&apos;s Government are not the obstacle to peace.2. France.M. Cambon&apos;s views are that the Allies should traverse theassertion that the Allies began the war, that they should once morecall attention to the German atrocities, and that they should end by stating that they are anxious for peace, but that an offer of peace without terms was not a genuine offer, and could not be considered.His Excellency wishes France to take the lead in the matter inview of her better position in America and in order to show that itis not England who is compelling the continuance of the war. he does not advise a Conference in Paris to draw up the terms of the reply, as this would waste time, and would seem as if the Allieswere attaching undue importance to the German offer.3. Italy.Baron Sonnino thinks that Germany is courting a directrefusal, in order to justify her continuing the war and to stimulatesocialist propaganda in neutral and Allied countries. (N.B. This isborne out by the German socialist mission to Holland.) He suggestsrefuting in measured terms the statement that the war was forcedon the Central Powers, that they have been victorious, &amp;c, andsaying that they must declare their terms on general lines. If theterms foreshadowed annexations, the Allies could then refuse to treat further. He expressed the hope that the Allies would notmistrust each other.    Even status quo would not suit Italy.4. Belgium.Baron Bey ens desires conference in order to draw up anidentic reply. Flat refusal would be a mistake. Allies should, inhis opinion, say that they cannot enter upon negotiations withoutknowing the nature of the German proposals.5. Japan.it is so far only press statement has been received. It states thatimpossible for Japan to accept status quo ante.Washington, Tel.No. 3742, Dec. 14.Washington, Tel.Private. Dec. 15.Washington, Tel.No. 3744, Dec. 15.United States.(B.) Neutrals.Sir C. Spring-Rice reports that general feeling is that allies should not refuse to receive from the Germans authentic terms ofpeace. Refusal would much strengthen the German position in theUnited States of America.His Excellency advises expressing strong desire for peace, butstating that the action of His Majesty&apos;s Government must be guided by the nature of the terms offered, and by agreement with our Allies.It should be added that, in the meanwhile, war would be continued with all means in our power until a secure peace is restored. If thePresident should make any suggestions on his own account, HisMajesty&apos;s Government should express appreciation for his friendlyaction in a non-committal way. The German party in the UnitedStates of America are clearly hoping for a direct refusal.Sir C. Spring-Rice also suggests that it would be well to makea statement in the United States of America on the general lines o Lord Grey&apos;s speech of the 22nd March, 1m15, regarding reparationThe United States Administration is anxious to endfor Belgium.

Sir A. Johnstone sums up the general opinon in Holland as no. 1772, Dec. 14. follows : The Allies would be mistaken in rejecting the offer rightoff; a point-blank refusal would arouse neutral sentiment againstthe Allies and would enable German Government to brace their people to hold out under their sufferings.Sweden.Stockholm, Tel. The Minister for Foreign Affairs considers that the note is aNo. 3138, Dec. 14. manoeuvre, which the Allies could best meet by saying that theyare anxious for peace, just as much as Germany was, and asking theGerman Government to tabulate their conditions. If these should prove impossible of acceptance the burden of responsibility for thecontinuance of the war would rest with Germany. A flat refusal ofthe German offer would be wrong.Vatican. *Count de Satis, Tel. Cardinal Gasparri urges strongly against a flat refusal, which,No. 42, Dee. 16.       m njs opinion, would be a mistake.   The Germans should be askedto state their terms, and, if they should prove impossible, the moraladvantage would rest with the Allies in continuing the struggle.He says that he has reason to believe that the German terms will bemoderate.APPENDIX III.PRANCE.   (&quot; Times,&quot; December 14.)FRANCE AND THE INVITATION.Statement by M. Briand.(From our own Correspondent.)Paris, December 13, 1916.The new French Government met the Chamber this afternoon.M. Briand dealt a&apos;t some length with Germany&apos;s expression of a desire for peace,declaring that, although he did not for a moment doubt the perspicacity of thecountry, it was, nevertheless, his bounden duty to put France upon her guard againstpeace, which was really an attempt to split up the Allies. Surveying the situation,he showed that, despite German successes in the past year, more than ever France,which had supported almost alone the terrible weight of the attack in 1914, hadreasons for confidence in her conviction of the certitude of victory.It is (he continued) after proclaiming her victory that Germany feels moved to throw out peace proposals. I have not the right to express myself with regard tothem except in full accord with our Allies, but I have the right to warn the country against the possible poison of such attempts. (Cheers.) When the country is armingitself to the teeth, when it is disorganising its homes, of which it was so proud, when
*all its factories are alight with war work, when it is collecting war labour everywhere,I call to my country to look out, to beware.The proposal is that we should negotiate a peace. Yes, but Serbia, Belgium, and roumania are invaded, and the crime is unchastised. It is a step designed to troubleour consciences, and it is doubtful whether, in the present circumstances, those whoseagency has been asked will accept the task which might disturb many minds.Herr Bethmann Hollweg says : &quot; It is not we who wanted this horrible war. Itwas forced upon us.&quot; To that I reply for the hundredth time, &quot;You were the aggressors, and whatever you may say the facts prove it, and the bloodshed is on yourheads, not on ours.&quot; (Loxid cheers.) It is my right to denounce this trap. We wish,we are told by the Chancellor, to give to our peoples all the means of prosperit.y : toour enemies we offer as alms that we are good enough to consent not to destroy them..It is to France, glorious France of the Marne and of Verdun, that this offer is made. Ihave the right to say that this is an attempt to split up the Allies and to demoralise the peoples. The French Republic in such circumstances will be loyal to its pledges.(Loud cheers.)M Briand&apos;s speech was at once followed by an agitated discussion as to theresolution to be adopted, and by a series of well-sustained attacks upon the Govern-ment&apos;s policy, particularly in the Near East.The Chamber finally adopted a motion of confidence by 314 votes to 165.Paris, December 13.-M. Briand, in the course of his speech, referred to theposition of Roumania, and said: Without exaggerated optimism we must now, more than ever, entertain the conviction and certainty of victory. We must not forget that the German troops from the very beginning hurled themselves on us when&apos; we were almost isolated.France sustained the shock and rendered possible a decisive victory. Nowhere werethe German successes decisive.It is true that gallant Roumania had to give way. That was sad, but her army,supported by the Russian, armies, will recover itself. The Eastern question is far from being settled, and to-morrow a new front [?] will be mobilised on the enemy front.It will be said that the year 1916 did not bring any victories, but we must lookthings in the face. It is the German army which did not achieve victory, becauseafter eight months of operations the victory of Verdun was entered on our creditbalance.RUSSIA.-(&quot;Times&quot; December 16th.)THE DUMAS REFUSAL.Peace only after Victory.Foreign Minister&apos;s Declaration.Petrograd, December 15fIn his speech M. Pokrovsky said : I am addressing you immediately on having been appointed to the post of Ministerfor Foreign Affairs, and am, naturally, not in a position to give you a detailed state-ment on the political situation of the day. But I feel constrained to inform youwithout delay and with the supreme authorisation of His Imperial Majesty of theattitude of the Russian Government with regard to the application of our enemies,,of which you heard yesterday through the telegrams of the news agencies.Words of peace coming from the side which bears the whole burden of responsi-bility for the world conflagration, which it started, and which is unparalleled in theannals of history, however far back one may go, were no surprise to the Allies. In.the course of the two and a half years that the war has lasted Germany has more than once mentioned peace. She spoke of it to her armies and to her people each time sheentered upon amailitary operation which was to prove &quot; decisive.&quot; After each militarysuccess, calculated with a view to creating an impression, she put out feelers for aseparate peace on one side and another and conducted an active propaganda in thej 1365-10] D
neutral Press. All these German efforts met with the calm and determined resistance of the Allied Powers.Now, seeing that she is powerless to make a breach in our unshakable alliance,Germany makes an official proposal to open peace negotiations. In order properly to appreciate the meaning of this proposal one must consider its intrinsic worth and thecircumstances in which it was made, in substance the German proposal contains notangible indications regarding the nature of the peace which is desired. It repeats theantiquated legend that the war was forced upon the Central Powers, it speaks of the victorious Austro-German armies, and the irresistibility of their defence, and then,proposing the opening of peace negotiations, the Central Powers express the conviction that the offers which they have to make will guarantee the existence, honour, and freedevelopment of their own peoples, and are calculated to establish a lasting peace.That is all the communication contains, except a threat to continue the war to a victorious end, and, in the case of refusal, to throw the responsibility for the furtherspilling of blood on our Allies.For Germany&apos;&apos;s Profit Only.What are the circumstances in which the German proposal was made ? Theenemy armies devastated and occupied Belgium, Serbia, and Montenegro, and a part ofFrance, Russia, and Roumania. The Austro-Germans have just proclaimed the illusoryindependence of a part of Poland, and are by this trying to lay hands on the entirePolish nation. Who, then, with the exception of Germany, could derive any advantageunder such conditions by the opening of peace negotiations ?But the motives of the German step will be shown more clearly in relief if onetakes into consideration the domestic conditions of our enemies. Without speaking ofthe unlawful attempts of the Germans to force the population of Russian Poland totake arms against its own country, it will suffice to mention the introduction ofgeneral forced labour in Germany to understand how hard is the situation of our enemies. To attempt at the last moment to profit by their fleeting territorial conquestsbefore their domestic weakness was revealed that was the real meaning of theGerman proposal. In the event of failure they will exploit at home, the refusal of theAllies to accept peace in order to rehabilitate the tottering moral of their populations.But there is another senseless motive for the step they have taken. Failing tounderstand the true spirit which animates Russia, our enemies deceive themselves with the vain hope that they will find among us men cowardly enough to allow them-selves to be deceived if even for a moment by lying proposals. That will not be. NoRussian heart will yield. On the contrary, the whole of Russia will rally all the more closely round its august Sovereign, who declared at the very beginning of the war thathe &quot;would not make peace until the last enemy soldier had left our country.&quot;Russia will apply herself with more energy than ever to the realisation of the aims proclaimed before you on the day when you reassembled, especially to the positive and general collaboration which constitutes the only sure means of arriving atthe end which we all have at heart namely, the crushing of the enemy. The RussianGovernment repudiates with indignation the mere idea of suspending the. struggle and thereby permitting Germany to take advantage of the last chance she will have ofsubjecting Europe to her hegemony. All&apos;the innumerable sacrifices already made would be in vain if a premature peace were concluded with an enemy whose forces have been shaken but not broken, an enemy who is peeking a breathing space by making deceitful offers of a permanent peace. In this inflexible decision, Russia is incomplete agreement with all her valiant Allies. We are all equally convinced of the vital necessity of carrying on the war to a victorious end, and no subterfuge by our enemies will prevent us from following this path. Renter.
Note on the German Offer of Peace.IT is assumed that the policy of this country is to avoid being forced into peacenegotiations at the present time.There seem to he only two events which could defeat this policy : (1) Thedefection of one of the principal. Allies ; (2) the active intervention of the UnitedStates by cutting off supplies of money and munitions.The danger of defection of one of our Allies, though not negligible, does notappear to be imminent. The situation in Russia, Italy, and even in France, is not veryreassuring ; but it does not appear to be likely that, at the present moment, any one ofthese countries would desire to enter into peace negotiations with Germany. It is,however, very important that the section of the Allied peoples which desires peaceshould not be allowed to say with any plausibility that England was the only one ofthe Allies who really desired to continue the war.The case with regard to America is rather different. An article in the &quot; New YorkTimes &quot; reported in to-day&apos;s &quot; Times &quot; and other circumstances lead one to suppose that the pacifist feeling in America is very strong, and the utterances of CountBernstorff are at any rate consistent with the view that he has some hopes of inducingthe President to intervene in the matter. The intervention of the President is notintrinsically improbable ; he has nothing to hope for in domestic politics ; he is knownto be a genuine and ardent lover of peace; and the role of mediator in the greatestwar in European history may well be attractive to him. It must further berecognised that, if he desired to put a stop to the war, and was prepared to paythe price for doing so, such an achievement is in his power. It may be thatthe incident with the Federal Reserve Board the other day was intendedto remind us of that fact, since it seems to be clear that it was due to the presidents own intervention that the Federal Reserve Board took their action, whichhad the effect of stopping the actual financial operation in which we were engaged.There can be no doubt that, if the President exerted himself, he could.prevent, whetherby legislative means or otherwise, the raising of Allied loans in the United States, notto speak of interference with the export of munitions and other necessaries: It is inthe highest degree improbable that the President would ever take such action becauseof any quarrel with us ; but, unless I misread his character, it is not impossible thathe might take even very violent action to enforce what he regarded as a just peace.I submit, therefore, that the answer to the German Note should have chiefly inview the effect it will have on public opinion in Allied countries and on the mind ofthe President of the United States. It is also desirable that it should nullify as far aspossible the effect which the German offer may have had upon opinion in Germanyitself.For these reasons I submit that a contemptuous rejection of the Note by the Allies,and still more by this country acting alone, would be in the highest degree imwise.It would be far preferable indeed that this country should not take the lead in thematter at all, but that, as far as it can be managed, France should be put in the firstplace. Her sacrifices have been far greater than ours; she cannot, by any stretch ofimagination, be regarded as the aggressor in this war; and she has a very special position in the United States.I do not see how French leadership can be emphasised unless it can be contrivedthat the reply shall be issued from Paris. On the other hand, it is of great importance that the reply should be a joint reply, representing the views of all the Allies, great and small, including particularly Belgium and Serbia. It seems therefore desirablethat the reply should be issued from an Allied Conference in Paris. I do not mean that the reply should necessarily be settled at such a Conference. The French Ambas-ambassador asked me to-day whether I thought it would be desirable for the FrenchGovernment to suggest a draft reply ; and I said that, speaking for myself only, i thought that it would be desirable. If that suggestion is acted upon, the draft would naturally be subjected to the criticism of Russia, ftaly, and Japan,&apos;besides ourselves,and, when agreed upon by all of us, it might be formally proposed at a Conference of.all the Allies in Paris.   This would be better than merely requiring the assent of the
small Allies, as M. Cambon suggested to me. It may be thought, perhaps, that to havea Conference about the German offer would be to attach undue importance to it,but I do not take that view. It is an important fact, and there is no harm in recog-recognising that it is so.With regard to the substance of the reply: it would necessarily traverse the claims of conquest by the Germans, pointing out that they were more apparent than real; itwould equally deny the allegations that we were the aggressors in the war, aud thatwe desired to continue it in order to destroy Germany or the German people; it would point out that the whole tone of the speech which made the framework of the Noteshowed that Prussian militarism was as strong as ever, and that experience showed that, whatever professions of moderation might be made by other sections of theGerman people, it was Prussian militarism that really directed German policy;attention should be called to the fact that there was no trace of repudiation or regretfor German atrocities, and that, indeed, what are in some respects the worst of all ofthem Belgian deportations were actually proceeding while the Chancellor spoke.As to the substance of the Note, it should be said that we are all in favour ofpeace ; but the cause of peace is not advanced by vague professions of a desire for it  and the German Note is nothing more than such a profession. Until the Germans areprepared to come forward and state their terms, it is impossible to believe in theirsincerity.   Negotiations begun without any definite basis would be a mere mockery.Foreign Office, December 15, 1916.PiilSmSB AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE BY G. R. HARRISON.-20/12/1916.
