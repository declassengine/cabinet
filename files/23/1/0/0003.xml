THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff reminded the WarCabinet of the decision taken by the late War Committee on the1st December (W.C.-94, Conclusion 3, reproduced in Appendix I),approving in principle the adoption of measures for the curtailment of railway ^passenger and goods) traffic in this country, andauthorizing the Board of Trade to take the necessary action with theleast possible delay. He said that, so far as he was aware, no action had been taken.The Secretary reported that the above decision of the war committee had been communicated to the former President of theBoard of Trade, and immediately on the change of Government thenew President had been notified. He understood that action wasbeing taken by the Board of Trade.The War Cabinet decided that the Board of Trade should be instructed to carry out immediately the detailed proposals of theRailway Executive Committee, contained in their letter dated the2nd December, 1916, unless they saw any objection.   In the event of
such objections, the Board of Trade should report immediately to theWar Cabinet.2. The War Cabinet decided that the draft Bill, prepared inaccordance with the decisions of the late Government on the 30thNovember, by a Committee under the late Minister of Munitions(W.C.-94, Conclusion 5, reproduced in Appendix II), should be circulated immediately to the Members of the War Cabinet, and discussed, if possible, on the following day. The Adjutant-general should be asked to authorize the Director of Recruiting to circulate a Memorandum on the subject for the information of the WarCabinet. The Secretary was instructed to invite Mr. chamberlain and Mr. Long to attend the discussion oh this subject.3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reminded the WarCabinet that on the 16th November the late War Committee had decided that the next 100,000 rifles due to this country from theUnited States of America should be sent direct to Roumania.(W.C.-S7, Conclusion 3, reproduced in Appendix III.) He saidthat since this decision had been reached the situation in roumania had altered materially. The Roumanian army had been considerablydiminished. General Joffre had informed him that the FrenchGovernment had undertaken to send to Roumania 200,000 riflesbefore March, and 20,000 rifles a month after March, and consideredthat this number should be adequate. General Joffre, however, had consulted General Berthelot, and was awaiting his reply. Inaddition, the British Government now wanted the rifles urgentlythemselves. The Indian Government had made a proposal to createtwenty-two additional battalions, and to embody white volunteers.If these proposals materialized, as he hoped they would, morerifles would be required in India, where, even now, the rifle position was far from satisfactory. At the instance of the General Staff, theColonial Office had approached various oversea Dependencies with aview to the raising of further troops and, if these schemes matured,additional rifles Would be required. He considered it possiblethat an amicable arrangement might be made with the roumanian government to release us from the undertaking to send the rifles.The War Cabinet were of opinion that it would be necessary tomake an amicable arrangement with the Roumanian Government, inorder to avoid any disappointment in Roumania if our promise ivereabruptly cancelled. Provided that General Berthelot&apos;s reply was satisfactory, they authorized the Chief of the Imperial General staff to enter into negotiations with Roumania, in order to relieve us ofour undertaking.4. The War Cabinet had under consideration the policy to beadopted in regard to Norway.The Minister for Blockade gave a sketch of the present politicalsituation with regard to Norway. He said that two arrangements had been concluded with Norway: one with regard to fish, and theother with regard to copper.Under the arrangement with regard to fish we undertook topurchase all the fish caught after the 18th August. The Norwegianswere only allowed to sell 15 per cent, of the total catch outsideNorway, and then only provided that the fish was not caught with british material in the form of nets, cutch, &amp;c.The agreement in regard to copper was based on the fact that norway, though producing a. large amount of raw copper, has notthe plant to refine it for electrical purposes. Consequently Norwaywas compelled to import what electrolytic copper she required.
Formerly Norway used to export a large amount of raw copper toGermany. We, however, had taken advantage of the fact that norway required large quantities of electrolytic copper, which couldonly be obtained from abroad, to compel Norway to enter into anagreement not to export copper to either belligerent, except in returnfor an equivalent import of copper. In the course of these coppernegotiations we had also taken up the question of pyrites. Pyriteswas the raw material from which sulphuric acid was manufactured,the principal alternative raw material in Europe being Siciliansulphur, which was not now available to Germany. The copperarrangement was extended to cover all pyrites containing copper.Recently Germany had started to put pressure on Norway bysinking her ships with submarines, and this form of warfare againstneutrals had been intensified alter the action of the Norwegians inexcluding belligerent submarines from their territorial waters. since this difficulty in regard to submarines had arisen there had also beentrouble in regard to pyrites. It had appeared that there was a gooddeal of pyrites in Norway containing only -g- per cent, of copper, andthe Norwegians had allowed this noti-cupreous pyrites to go toGermany, particularly from one mine, known as the Storg mine.The question on which Lord Robert Cecil now wanted to constdtthe War Cabinet was aa to the attitude we should take up. TheBritish Minister in Norway had already made every sort of x)rotestand demand for reparation from the Norwegians. Sir M. Findlayhad also sent, on 9th December, a long telegram (No. 4374), whichhad been circulated to the War Cabinet, in which he had suggestedthat the Norwegian Minister in London should be solemnly warned that any further measure or omission on the part of the norwegian government, prejudicial to our vital interests, would be treated asbeing undertaken at the dictates of Germany, and, consequently, asan unneutral act; that, if this occurred, His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould take such action- as seemed desirable without furtherwarning; and that, in order to justify their action to the Norwegianpeople, towards whom they cherished feelings of friendship, theywould publish their notes to the Norwegian Government on thesubject. Finally, Sir M. Findlay had suggested that if his proposals were adopted the Government should be prepared, if necessary, tocarry them out to the very end, which might include the demandfor or even the seizure of a naval base.This course did not recommend itself to Lord Robert Cecil.He reminded the War Cabinet that, in a joint memorandum, datedthe 2nd November, 4916, the Admiralty War Staff and the WarOffice General Staff had come to the conclusion that it would not bean advantage if Norway joined the Allies. He admitted, however,that the position was one of considerable difficulty. The germans had made a most formidable attack on Norwegian shipping, andhad destroyed 13 per cent, of the total. Some of the Norwegian news-papers were urging that, as Norway had made a great deal of moneyout of the war, her shipping should now be laid up and reserved foruse at the end of the war. We had a strong weapon of pressure inthe possibility of refusing supplies of coal ; but in the case oi Sweden,this weapon had failed, as Germany had replaced the supplies ofcoal that this country had refused. There was some reason to believe,however, that Germany&apos;s output of coal was now slightly reduced,and it might be impossible for her to supply Norway as well asSweden. His view was that we should send for the norweigen minister, and make the strongest protests and demands for reparation to him, and, if these protests produced no restdt, weshould resort to economic pressure to the fullest possible extent bystopping supplies of copper, fishing materials, coal, &amp;c. In doing this,however, we had to bear in mind that the Norwegians could retaliateby stopping the supplies of nitrate of ammonia, which were muchrequired by France, and by interrupting communication to Russiathrough Norway.
Admiral Sir John Jellicoe said that, from a naval point of view,there was nothing to prevent Germany sending coal to Norway, asit would be unnecessary for the ships to leave territorial waters. Itwould be impracticable for us to seize a naval base if Norway were hostile, though, if Norway were favourable to us, this could bedone.Lord Curzon pointed out to the War Cabinet that by decisionsof the late War Committee, dated the 2nd and 13th November, wewere actually making preparations to give aerial assistance to Norwayin case of. necessity. This was incongruous with the suggestedattitude towards Norway. 4The decision of the War Cabinet was that the Minister of blockade should send for the Norwegian Minister and make a strong protest against the action of the Norwegian Government. If thisfailed, we should exercise economic pressure to the utmost possible extent as proposed by Lord Robert Cecil. The Minister of Blockadeshould point out to the Norwegian Minister the absurdity of theposition if we were to continue to assist Norway in providing againstaerial attack while she persisted in supply trig Germany.5. The War Cabinet also decided that the Joint Memorandumof the Admiralty War Staff and the War Office General Staff, datedthe 2nd November, 1916, in regard to Norway, should be sent to admiral Sir John- Jellicoe, who should inform the War Cabinetwhether he agreed with the views expressed by his predecessor.The Circulation of papers and other documents of the classes hithertocirculated to members of theCabinet.6. The War Cabinet decided that the Minutes of the War-Cabinet, Foreign Office telegrams, and War Office and Admiraltytelegrams, should be sent to the following :  The Members of the War Cabinet.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.The Secretary of State for the Colonies.The Secretary of State for India.The Secretary of State for War.The First Lord of the Admiralty.The Minister for Blockade.The President of the Board of Trade.Future Business.7. The Secretary was instructed to invite the approval of thePrime Minister to an early discussion on the following subjects : (1.) The German naval base at Zeebrugge.(2.)

War urged the importance of cutting down the railway traffic in this country, not only in order to releaserailway workers for service with the Colours (particularly enginedrivers, who are needed for railway traffic in France), but also to release a supply of locomotives urgently required for the use of theBritish Expeditionary Force. He said that the Army Council had. decided to stop the week-end leave of soldiers engaged on home service, but only on the understanding that it should be part of a plan which would curtail facilities for the general public also.This curtailment of week-end leave would not apply to &quot; draftleave.&quot; He said that a general plan had already been discussed with the Board of Trade, involving the curtailment of the facilitiesfor the public for rapid travelling. At present the facilities in this country had not been reduced to the same extent as in France. He also urged the cutting-down of muchnon-essential business traffic in order to release trucks, whichare also urgently required for the use of the Expeditionary Forcenext year. These measures, he said, if adopted, would save labour,coal, and repair work.The War Committee reached the following decisions : (a.) They approved in principle the adoption of measures for the curtailment of railway (passenger and goods) traffic inthis country, and decided that the Board of Trade shouldtake the necessary action accordingly with the least possible delay.

As regards Christmas traffic, they decided that the reducedrailway facilities should, as far as possible, be appor-tioned in the following order : (i.)   Sailors on active service and soldiers on leavefrom the front.(ii.)  Transferred munition workers to whom twoJoz/s&apos; holiday has been promised at Christmas.(iii.) The general public.These latter recommendations will probably involve some systemof permits for munition workers and persons compelled to travel on business. The War Committee left the details for arrangement between the Ministry of Munitions, War Office, Admiralty, Board ofTrade, and the railway companies.* The President of the Board of Trade has notified the Secretary of the War Committee that he hashad conferences on this subject already; that, the necessary steps had been taken before this decision; andthat further curudlments of traffic are in view.[1365-3] t - C

(Extract from the Proceedings of a War Committee held onNovember30, 1916.)5. With reference to the discussion on this subject on the21st November (W.O.-90, Conclusion 2), the War Committee havereceived the following proposals for the adoption of compulsory national service:  (i.) A proposal contained in Section XI of the Third Report ofthe Man-Power Distribution Board,(ii.) A proposal contained in a memorandum by the Minister ofMunitions, dated the 15th November, 1916.(iii.) The  following  proposal  contained in   a   memorandumaddressed by the military members of the Army Councilto  the  Secretary of  State for War, dated the 28thNovember, 19.10 : &quot; That the military age should be raised to 55 years,and that all men up to that age should be utilised forsuch national service as His Majesty&apos;s Government deemto be essential for the effective prosecution of the war.&quot;In view of the serious military situation with which the allies are confronted in consequence of the levy en masse in Germany ;the deportation to Germany for labour purposes of the populations of the occupied territories ; the invasion of&apos;Roumania ; the difficultfinancial situation likely to arise in the United States of America ;and the shortage of merchant shipping and food supplies, themembers of the War Committee were unanimously of opinion thatthe time has come for the adoption of compulsory national service inthis country.The Committee reached the following decisions : (a.) They approved in principle the adoption of compulsory national service for all men up to the age of 60 years *(b.) They appointed a Committee with the Minister of Munitionsin the Chair, consisting of representatives of thefollowing: The Ministry of Munitions, the Home Office,the War Office, the Local Government Board, theBoard of Trade, the Man-Power Distribution Board,the Labour Adviser, and the Food Controller, towork out details, including the minimum age for its appli-cation to males ; the advisability of extending it to females,including age limits ; and the necessary legislation.(c.) The War Committee attach great importance to the enact-ment of the necessary legislation before Christmas, butthey recognise that Parliament must be consulted with aview to a release from any pledges, agreements, and under-takings which would be violated if the scheme actuallypresented were carried out, and which were entered intounder circumstances entirely different from the present.compulsory national Service.* The President of the Board of Trade, who was unable to attend this meeting until after this decisionhad been reached, asks that it may be placed on record that he was not present, and that, as at presentadvised, be is unable to concur in the adoption of the principle of industrial conscription for all men up tothe age of 60.
(Extract, f rom the Proceedings of a War Committee held onNovember 16, 1916.)3. The Minister of Munitions informed the War Committeethat he had received applications from the Roumanian Represen-tative for an immediate supply of 100.000 rifles, and that whereasFrance had already supplied Roumania with b&apos;0,000 rifles, and was continuing the supply, this country had given her nothing in theway of rifles. He suggested the possibility of meeting this request by diverting 100,000 American rifles direct to Roumaniavia, Vladivosfcock, or, failing this, by allocating to Roumania Rossrifles or E.Y. rifles, which are used for secondary purposes inthis country. The Master-General of Ordnance stated that latterlyhe had been receiving only 7,000 to 8,000 rifles a week from theUnited States, and that rifles were urgently required for re-armingthree new divisions, and were also necessary for training reserves and for distribution to Colonials, India, and South Africa, as well asthe Portuguese division in France. He was of opinion that our reserves must come first, and that a promise to the Government ofIndia to supply 30,000 rifles before the end of the year must .be redeemed. The Minister of Munitions pointed out that the declinein output was due to the crisis in regard to rifles contracts inAmerica, with which the War Committee dealt on the 17th October(W.C.-76, Conclusion 4).In view of the situation in Roumania, and of the statement that there were 300,000 trained men there without rifles, theWar Committee decided that the next 100,000 rifles from Americashould be sent direct to Roumania, and that the War Oflice must decide on the relative urgency of other demands.printed at the foreign office  bx  c. r. harrison.-23/12/1916
