February 1017.22SECRET,80WAR CABINET, 66.: Minutes of a Meeting of the War Cabinet held at 10, Downing Street, on Wednesday,.  February 14, 1917, at 5&quot;30.Present:The Prime Minister (in the Chair).The Right  Hon. the  Earl Curzon kedleston, K.G., G.C.S.I., G.C.I.E.The Right Hon. A.

Young, Assistant Secretary.Mr, Thomas Jones, Assistant Secretary.Agriculture: *Guaranteed prices for Wheat, Oats,and Potatoes.1. THE War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumby the President of the Board of Agriculture on the serious positionof agriculture, and the necessity for a system of guaranteed prices(Appendix I).In regard to the proposed guarantee of prices, the President ofthe Board of Agriculture, Mr. Strutt, and Mr. Hall expressed theview that it was necessary to give the farmer some inducement to grow more food. At present the farmer was discouraged, and con-sidered that the attitude of the Government towards him hadthroughout been antagonistic and unsympathetic. The farmer wasin a rut, and made excuses to himself; he opposed the employmentof women and of substituted labour on the land. There was nodoubt that the farmer could do much better than at present, but hecould not be persuaded to do so without security in the shape of guaranteed prices.Sir Henry Rew, representing the Food Controller, doubted whether the offer of a guarantee against commandeering belowcertain fixed prices would make the difference between inducing the farmer to sow or not to sow.* The discussion of this subject was begun at the previous Meeting (WarCabinet, Go). Lord Selborne, Sir Arthur Lee, and Professor Adams attended for the evening meeting only.[1365 66]
Lord Selborne said he agreed with the policy advocated in mr. Prothero&apos;s Memorandum. He also favoured a guaranteedminimum wage for the labourer, and power being taken by the state to see that, the land of the country was rightly used. These views were generally shared by the members of the Reconstruction Sub-Committee on Agricultural Policy. The danger of the presentsituation was that in the farmeFs view the; profitable and leastrisky course was to continue grass-farming.Great difference of opinion was expressed as to the probablemovements of prices in the period following the end of the war, andas to whether the lower minima suggested by Mr. Prothero wouldnot tend to rise to the higher minima, below which it was suggested the State should not commandeer produce It was difficult to fore-tell the post-war position, having regard, on the one hand, to theshortage which will exist in the Central Powers, France, and Italy,the reduced production due to the deterioration of the soil and theshortage of fertilisers, and the drain on shipping tonnage in connec-tion with demobilisation; on the other hand, there might be a surplus in Russia and the United States, and, owing to the stimula-tion of agriculture and greater use of machinery, possibly in theUnited Kingdom and the Dominions.Iffie problem confronting the War Cabinet was stated asfollows : If they declined to give the guarantee to farmers, thecountry might, in view of a possible intensification of submarine warfare, find itself in a serious position owing to a decrease in home production of cereals, due to the refusal of the farmers to cultivatecrops. If, on the contrary, the farmers were guaranteed the prices,it might result in a position after the war in which the State waspaying for crops prices far in excess of what the state of theinternational market required.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The Government should enter into a contract with the farmers, and guarantee a scale of minimum prices for wheat and oats for a period of six years, and for potatoes-for three years, beginning with 1917, the guaranteed prices to be as follows : Wheat.19171918191919201921192260/- per504 lb.55/- ,,45/- ,,45/- ,,45/- .,55/-Oatt.1917191819191920192119223S/6 per 336 lb. ;,]32/- ,,32/-  ,,24/- ,,24/- ,,24/- . ,,Potatoes.1917        ... ... ...   6Z. per ton.1918        ... ... ...   4Z. 10s. per ton.1919        . ... ...   4Z. 10s.(b ) The Government should review the position in 1920 so asto give the farmer due notice of the termination of the contract, or of any changes therein which it was proposedto make, i
&quot;Weekly Summariesof ExternalPolitical Affairs.2. The War Cabinet decided that The Weekly Summaries of External Political Affairs prepared,under the direction of the Secretary, by Lieutenant-colonel sir Mark Sykes, Bart., M.P., and Captain L. 0. M. S.Amery, M.P., should be circulated to Mr. Massey, thePrime Minister of New Zealand, and Sir Joseph Ward,the Finance Minister of New Zealand, and to the other representatives of the Dominions and India at the forth-coming Special War Cabinet Meetings, after their arrival in this country (War Cabinet, 40, Minute 1). ;2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,February 15, 1917.(Initialled)D. LI. G.[1365-66](o.) The Government should undertake not to commandeerproduce during 1917, 1918, and 1919 for less than, inthe case of wheat, 70/-; oats 45/-; potatoes 81. per tonfor 1917, and 11. per ton for 1918 and 1919.(d.) As a part of the policy of guaranteed prices, the Govern-ment should secure a wage of 25/- a week to agricultural labourers during the period of the guarantee, and shouldmake provision for the establishment of Wage Boards;for compelling owners and tenants to make the best useof the land under their control; and for preventingrents being raised during the period of the Stateguarantee, except in special cases, e.g., where the land-owner himself pays tithe, such special cases to receivethe sanction of the Board of Agriculture.The Prime Minister undertook to make a statement in theHouse of Commons in explanation of the above decisions.
Memorandum by the President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries.THE position, of agriculture is serious. The. confidence of the farmer has beendaagerously disturbed during the last two months. Unlessdt is restored; and restoredimmediately, production will shrink, and the country will be left with a very diminishedsupply of home-grown food for 1917, and little effort will be made to increase production for .1918.Food is wanted, and in as great abundance as possible. A system of guaranteed prices lasting over a series of years seems to me to Toe the only possible means whichwould restore confidence to the farmer and encourage him to embark upon increased production, with its attendant initial outlay and risk, without fear that a sudden changein the market may render his venture unprofitable. High prices will probablycontinue for some time after the cessation of hostilities because of the delays ofdemobilisation, the continued absorption of tonnage for that purpose, and the shortageof both men and food in Europe, consequent on the war. But the farmer is not convinced of this. He has an idea that the stocks of food in the world are as large asever, and that they will immediately be liberated on the conclusion of peace, with a consequent fall in prices to the level which he knew in the nineties. He does not mean to be caught with an increased area of arable, land should this fall occur. Recentinterferences with market prices have also filled him with the fear that, even if prices are high, his produce may be commandeered at unremunerative rates.During the war the average rate of agricultural wages has been raised by nearly one-half. The farmer is now asked to part with still more of his skilled men to theArmy, and to replace them by untrained and therefore less efficient men recruited bythe Director of National Service, at a rate of wage as high as, or higher than, he hadbeen paying to the men he has lost. With the lack of tounage, fertilisers are dear andscarce, feeding stuffs will become still scarcer: all these causes have combined to double his costs of production.Idle rise in the rate of wages has come to stay. No one who has the interests ofthe country-side and farming at heart wants to go back to the old level; but the new standard wage which this policy contemplates does render it necessary to assure the farmer that he will obtain prices capable of paying them. Without this assurance he cannot think of maintaining, much less of expanding, his production. The guaranteesthat are to give him this assurance and security in adopting a forward policy are : - First, minimum prices to which the State contracts to make up the price, so thatthe return to the farmer does not fall below the minimum. This principle will applyat varying rates to 1917, 1918, 1919, 1920, 1921, and 1922.For the harvest of 1917 the minimum price for wheat of 60s. will not be disturbed ;oats will remain at 38s. 6d., potatoes at 6L per ton. For the harvests of 1918 and 1919the minimum prices will be : for wheat 55s. ; for oats, 32s. ;. for potatoes, 4L 10s. Theactual prices will in all probability remain above these minima, so that the guaranteeis unlikely to prove costly to the State.Second, comes the limiting prices below which the State undertakes not to com-mandeer produce. For 1917, these limits will be : for wheat, 70s. ; for oats, 45s. ; forpotatoes, 81. For 1918 and 1919 the limits will be: for wheat, 70s.; oats, 45s.;potatoes, 71. This guarantee involves no outlay on the part of the State--it onlylimits the powers of the State to deprive the farmer of potential profits.In the remaining three years, 1920-22, only the minimum guarantees will becontinued on a lower scale: for wheat, 45s. ; for oats, 24s.By this system, the farmer is secured by the minima against disastrous, thoughvery improbable, losses which might be caused by a break in the markets. By thelimits, he is secured from what he regards as an injustice. The natural price is neverraised to the consumer, though the State may be called upon to bear some loss shouldthe natural price fall below the guaranteed minima.The State thus makes a bargain with the farmer for a period of six years, offeringhim security in his business in order that he may extend production. Two years before the bargain terminates the position will be reviewed not as regards the existingguarantee for the remaining two years, but as to the policy that is to follow. It wouldbe impossible for the Government to pledge itself for any period longer than the six years,
but the agriculturist may take the present offer as an assurance that the State doesrealise the prime importance of agriculture in the national econony, and that whateverbargain may then be made will not be unfair to the farming community.These guarantees will be accompanied by legislation securing a standard wage of25s. a week the rate of wages which has been fixed by the Director of NationalService- while the war lasts, to be followed by a system of Wage Boards to put this difficult question on a satisfactory basis. The Legislature will also provide for pressure on landowners to secure that the land should be used in the national interest. It may also be considered necessary during the war period to limit the power of landownersto raise rents without the sanction of the Board of Agriculture.The policy thus outlined above would be only an instalment of further steps inthe direction of putting rural conditions on a sound footing as regards housing,reclamation, education, village life, rural industries, such as sugar beet and potatofactories, &amp;c.A.
