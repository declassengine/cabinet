The Director of Military Operations informed the WarCabinet that, according to the latest information received, theGermans claimed to have captured Matchin, and that the evacuation of the Dobrudja by the Russo-Roumanian forces was probable. Inthis event the enemy would be enabled to withdraw troops fromthat theatre for operations in Macedonia, it being possible for hisadvanced units to be transferred within a fortnights time, and for theremainder (amounting to the equivalent of ten divisions, fivefrom the Dobrudja and possibly five more from elsewhere) in ten weeks.As, however, the practice of the German Command was tofollow up a success, General Maurice considered it more likely thatthe enemy Would endeavour to cross to the left bank of the Danubeand continue to press our Allies in order to prevent them fromforming a line of defence on the River Sereth.2. With reference to the decision of the War Cabinet at theMeeting held on the 30th December, 1916 (War Cabinet Paper 23,.Minute 7), regarding the action to be taken by the Entente powers in order to ensure the safety of the magnesite mines in Eubcea, theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs read out Foreign office telegram No. 19 to Sir Francis Elliot, and Mr. Erskine&apos;s telegramNo. 22, both dated the 3rd January, 1917.In regard to the proposal to land a detachment of 50 or 200orB
rifles in Euboea, it was pointed oat that two alternative objectsunderlay the suggestion&apos; viz. : (a.) To arrest the leaders of Greek reservists on the island.(b.) To secure and protect the plant of the mines at Katounia.The First Sea Lord said that he thought it possible that amonitor might be detailed to support a military detachment landing on the island.   It was agreed that The actual strength of any such detachment must be deter-mined by the General Officer Commanding, British Force,Salonica.The War Cabinet decided that The First Sea Lord should send a telegram to the Vice-AdmiralCommandingjthe Eastern Mediterranean Squadron directinghim to report, in concert with the General Officer Com-manding, Salonica, what action he considered necessary,and proposed to take, in order to safeguard the mines and plant, and authorising him to take immediate action shouldcircumstances demand it.Information being received from the Director of Military Opera-tions, subsequent to the meeting, to the effect that if the mines inEubcea were interfered with during the next two months there would still remain a ten months&apos; supply of magnesite from other sources,the Chairman approved a modification of the above telegram in the sense that action was no longer a matter of urgency, and thatauthorisation to take instant action should not be given in the telegram, as it was undesirable to do anything which might precipitate hostilities.The Director of Military Operations was instructed to informthe Chief of the Imperial General Staff of the position.Belgian Exports.Attended in connec-tion with minutes, 4, and 5 :Sir A. Stanley,President of theBoard of Trade.3. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum byLord Robert Cecil, dated the 8th December, 1916, on the subject of belgian exports, together with a letter addressed to the ForeignOffice by M. Hymans, dated the 4th December, 1916 (Appendix I).The War Cabinet considered the question of Belgian exports inthe light of communications which had passed between the king of the Belgians and M. Berthelot, and between M. Cambon andLord Curzon.It was pointed out that the regulations laid down by the Britishand German Governments conflict and lead to evasion. We require that the price of commodities exported shall be deposited in a blocked account in this country, only enough to cover wages of belgian workmen being remitted. The German Government, onthe other hand, require that the whole of the purchase money shallbe remitted to Belgium as a security and demand a deposit of 10 to20 per cent, of the value of the goods before they are exported, and,in addition, the payment of an export tax. In some cases it seems clear that goods are being paid for in Belgium by money obtainedfrom Holland on the security of the blocked account in England.Three courses were considered : (1.)(2.)(3.)To insist on the rule laid down by the Cabinet in July 1915.This would lead to a stoppage of exports, to deportationsof workmen from Belgium to Germany, and to strongresentment on the part of the Belgian Government.To abandon the rule altogether. This would be considered as a weak concession to Germany.To permit Belgian exporters to comply with german demands while insisting that they shall not openlydepart from British conditions.
It appeared&quot; that the Belgian Government, while they would prefer the second course, were not opposed to the third, and theWar Cabinet decided that Either course  might be adopted, provided it was made acondition that the workmen employed in the factory where- the goods were made were not deported to Germany.4. The War Cabinet considered memoranda by Lord robert cecil, dated the 22nd December, 1916, and the 3rd January, 1917(Appendix III), dealing with the breach by the Germans of their undertakings with regard to the work of the Relief Commission in belgium, and with the application of German guarantees to parts ofBelgium newly transferred from civil to military control.With reference to these points, it was agreed that No further action could be taken beyond giving the fullestpublicity, especially in the United States, to what theGermans were doing.Southern Persia. 5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew the attentionof the War Cabinet to the situation in Southern Persia, withparticular reference to Sir Percy Sykes&apos;s mission. He pointed outthat Sir Percy Sykes was under the orders of Sir Charles Marling,and was consequently controlled by the Foreign Office.Having regard to the fact that the mission is essentially a police force, which it is proposed to maintain after the war, and also thatduring the war it will be engaged in operations of a military character, the War Cabinet decided that The question could not be satisfactorily discussed  in  theabsence of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff.(Initialled)      A.

BELGIAN EXPORTS.HOMemorandum by Lord Robert Gecil dated December 8,1916, and Letter addressed to Foreign Office byM. Hymans, dated December 4, 1916.1. HIS Majesty&apos;s Government have evidence whichis practically conclusive that the German authorities in belgium, before allowing any Belgian goods to leavethe country, insist on the exporters signing an under-taking that the vrhole amount of the purchase moneywill be remitted to Belgium, and that no part of it willbe deposited in the United Kingdom in a blockedaccount. To make certain that the undertaking is kept,the Germans exact the deposit of a- guarantee of 20 percent, of the value of the goods. At the same time theyare levying an export tax of 5 per cent, on old orders,and 10 per cent, on new orders.2. It is clearly impossible for a Belgian exporterto sign and keep the above undertaking, and yet complywith the British regulations, which are based on aCabinet decision of July 1915, and which lay down thatthe purchase money for Belgian goods should be deposited to the credit of the Belgian exporter in a blocked account at a British bank. But it appears that both or one set of the regulations can be evaded, andthat some Belgian firms have signed ,the German under-taking, and yet manage to satisfy the British regulations.Other firms, notably MM. Begniers, decline to sign theGerman undertaking and to pay the export tax, andthey are pressing His Majesty&apos;s Government very strongly either (1) to let them sign the German under-taking and pay the export tax, or (2) to refuse permitsand certificates of origin for goods from firms who have signed and paid.8. In April last, the United States and Spanishrepresentatives at Brussels were requested to ask theGerman authorities to agree to the purchase-money inrespect of Belgian goods being handed over to M. Hooverfor purposes of the Belief Commission. In spite ofrepeated reminders, it lias been impossible to obtain anyanswer from the German authorities, and it seems probable that they do not intend to reply. meanwhile it is imperative to decide what policy His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are going to adopt in regard to Belgianexports.4. Three courses seem open (1.) To waive the British regulations and allow theremittance cf the whole value of the goods to belgium instead of the 50-70 per cent, whichis now allowed to go.(2.) To insist on honest adherence to the Britishregulations and to refuse certificates of originand shipment permits to firms who have signed the German undertaking.(3.) To attempt to maintain the present modus. vivendi by ignoring the new German regula-dions and allowing export, provided that theBritish requirements are also fulfilled.5. The objections to all three courses are great. Asregards No. 1, the amount of money retained here fromthe 1st August, 1915, to the 31st July, 1916, onlyreaches 800,OOOZ,, and Belgian exports, which now con-sist almost entirely of glass and plants, are steadily
decreasing, so that the remittance of this money to belgium would he of no appreciable advantage to theGermans. But it means yielding to German threatsand German pressure, and would encourage them tomake further demands.6. The second alternative would presumably entail the suppression of all Belgian exports, and the BelgianGovernment would  make  the  most violent protest.Their argument is that for the salve of a few pounds,which cannot affect the war, His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthave almost killed all Belgian export trade, and by thusthrowing men but of work have given the Germans amore or less justifiable pretext for their deportation andemployment in Germany for German purpose0.   Theyadmit that the Germans could, if they wished, deportany Belgians whether in employment or not, bnt theyaffirm that the Germans have not done so as a matterof fact, and have not touched plant still running, whereas,as soon as a factory shuts down, they seize all the copper,brass, &amp;c, fittings and send them to Germany.   If HisMajesty&apos;s Government now suppress what remains of belgian trade, the only result will be further deportationsand a further increase in German man-power, with no corresponding advantage to the Allies.    The official committee of Belgian commerce in London state that german authorities have given an undertaking to theSpanish Minister in Brussels to repatriate any Belgianswho have been deported but were really employed atthe time of their deportation.   His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment have no confirmation of the above and its accuracymay well be doubted.7. The third alternative involves connivance at fraudpractised either on His MajestVs Government or theGermans. If adopted, firms such as MM. Regnierswdll have to be assured that no steps will be taken against them for signing the German undertaking. as things are at present, the firms who have signed theGerman undertaking and who can satisfy our require-ments are at liberty to carry on their business, whilefirms such as Regniers cannot, which is manifestlyunfair. Compliance with both sets of regulations canbe managed by various means, such as faked invoices ora double payment, the money require i for the payment in Belgium being probably borrowed in Holland. Sofar as the finance of the transaction is concerned, itamounts in reality to a loan from Holland to thiscountry for the period of the war.8. Sir A. Turing, who deals with all questions affecting the remittance of money to Belgium, is infavour of the third alternative, on the ground that nothing should be done which will afford the Germans a pretext for saying that His Majesty&apos;s Government aredriving Belgians into unemployment, and giving themthat excuse for widening the area of deportation.9. Personally, I am in favour of the second of thethree&apos; courses suggested. It is incredible that anyargumentative consideration will prevent the germans from deporting Belgians if they wish to do so. If itwere so, the first course would be right. The onlydifference between the first and the third course is that by the latter the Belgian exporter is made to pay twiceover, once to the Germans and once to us. But if hepays the Germans the evil is done. The second course,and. that alone, prevents increase of German resources.December 8, 1916. ,     11. C.
Legation de Belgique, Londres,M. le Secretaire d&apos;Etat,   &apos; le 4 decembre, 1916.LA legation a recu cles informations de source sure qui montrent que lesautorites allemandes ne permettent aux fabficarits beiges d&apos;exporfcer leurs raarchandisesvers les pays d&apos;outre-mer, y compris 1&apos;Angleterre, quo s&apos;ils signent la declaration dontmodel e ci-joint (annexe).Par cette declaration, 1&apos;exportateur prend 1&apos;engagement:1. De fournir la preuve que la merchandise a ete effeetivement embarquee enHollande et dechargee au lieu de destination;2. De faire rentrer en Belgique la contrevaleur complete de cet envoi;3. De ne cooperer, ni directement ni indirectement, a ce que, conformement auxexigences britanniques, une partie du prix de la marchandise soit deposee clans unebanque anglaise et bloquee jusqu&apos;a la conclusion de la paix.En outre, a titrc cle garantie, les autorites allemandes exigent le dep6t, entre lesmains d&apos;une banque, d&apos;une caution, s&apos;s&apos;elevant a 10 ou 20 pour cent de la vaieur de lafacture, qui leur est acquise de plein droit en cas de non-observation cles engagementsenumeres clans la declaration.Enfin, nos exportateurs doivent acquitter un droit de sortie cle 5 a 10 pour centde la vaieur de la facteur.Ce regime s&apos;applique surtout a la verrerie, glacerie et gobeleterie.De son cdte, le Gouvernement britannique n&apos;autorise les exportations beiges quemoyennant la consignation en Angleterre du montant du prix de vente.Nous nous trouvons done devant une situation sans issue.Actuellement, le mouvement d&apos;exportation, en ce qui concerns notamment laverrerie, se reduit surtout a 1&apos;expedition cles envois autorises par les Allemancls avantla mise en vigueur cle ces nouvelles mesures; et le jour n&apos;est pas eloigne ou. touteexportation sera arretee. LTn chomage general des ouvriers verriers suivra dans undelai tres rapproche si les usines ne trouvent plus le moyen d&apos;ecouler a 1&apos;etrangerleurs fabrications.Les consequences d&apos;une suspension force du travail des usines seraient extreme-ment graves et le Gouvernement beige, instruit par les evenements de ces dernieressemaines, est convaincu que 1&apos;occupant s&apos;empressera de prendre pretexte du chdmagede ces ouvriers pour les envoyer en Allemagne, soit pour mettre a la disposition desautorites znilitaires un nombre corresponclant de reservistes alleinands, soit simplementpour auginenter la main-d&apos;o3uvre masculine, clont il a si grand besoin, et ainsi prolongerla resistance.Les deportations, votre Excellence le sait, ne sont plus appliquees a quelques casisoles ou a quelques communes. Elles s&apos;etendent maintenant a toutes les localites, atoutes les provinces.Les Allemands saisissent de force nos travailleurs, jios vaillants ouvriers qui ontprefere souffrir de la faim que de travailler pour eux. Ces razzias, operees d&apos;abord unpeu au hasard, ont ete systematisees. Ou prend surtout des ouvriers industriels etagricoles. D&apos;apres des declarations allemandes, on compte ainsi cleporter de Belgique350,000 sans travail. -Or, si 1&apos;industrie du verre est obligee de fermer ses portes, 150,000 personnes vontetre privees de leur gagne-pain et tomberont a charge de la bienfaisance publique.Nous savons maintenant qu&apos;il ne s&apos;ecoulera que peu de temps avant que ce contingentn&apos;aille grossir la main-d&apos;ceuyre ennemie.Le chiffre indique ne vise que la verrerie : il sera bientdt renforce par celui desouvriers employes, dans les quelques industries qui ont encore reussi a vivoter et quiegalement devront arreter leurs operations, , .   .Lorsque, il y a dix-huit mois, 1&apos;Angleterre a voulu assimiler les marchandisesd&apos;origine beige aux produits d&apos;origine ennemie et empecher 1&apos;entree de toute matierepremiere en Belgique, le Gouvernement du Boi a insiste vivement sur le danger d&apos;unepareille politique. II a fait ressortir combien il etait dangereux de&apos;provoquer unch6mage general, qui lournirait a 1&apos;autorite occupante un pretexte facile pour prendredes mesures dont les Beiges d&apos;abord et les Allies ensuite aiiraient a souffrir.
Lorsque, apres de nombreuses discussions, le Gouverrierhent britanniqiie estrevenu sur sa decision premiere, il n&apos;a autorise la reprise des exportation^ beiges quemoyennant le dep6t en consignation dans une banque du Royaume-Uni du &quot;prix devente de la inarcUandise.II esperait ainsi priver 1&apos;Allemagne d&apos;un appoint monetaire dont elle auraitpu beneficier. Mais pour qu&apos;une mesure de ce genre eut eu de i&apos;effet, il aurait fall aqu&apos;elle portat sur des so names tres considerables, reuiltat d&apos;an mouvement commercialintense. On so rappelait qu&apos;avant la guerre la Belgique exportait pour 3,580,000,000de francs par an (commerce special 1911). On ne crpyait pas que la guerre abaisseraitce clsiffre au montant derisoire de 12,000,003 h 13,000,000 de francs d&apos;exportationsvers les pays neutres et allies, y oompris 1&apos;Angleterre, abstraction faite de la Hollande,en douze rr.ois. Aussi, peut-on dire, en presence de ce dernier ehiffre, dont votreExcellence petit contrdler l&apos;exactitude, que, si la rentree totale du prix de vente avaitete autorisee, 1&apos;appoint monetaire dont le territoire occupe aurait beneficie eut etepresque insignifiaht et n&apos;aur.iit ou qu&apos;une influence insensible soit sur le change anglo-hollaudais, soit. sur la situation financiere de 1&apos;Allemagne au point de vue de sonaptitude a contiuuer la guerre.LVautre part, tout en exigeant le depot en compte bloque du prix de lamarchandise, le Gouvernement britaunique a bieri voulu autoriser le rapatriernent enBelgique du montant des salaires des Ouvriers, des frais generaux et dautres fraisaccessoires. Ces sorames, reiiiarquons le, ne prbfitent pas a 1&apos;ennemi; elles vontdireotement aux Beiges et sont depensees aussitot que reeues. Lelement qui dansle prix de vente pent surtout profiter a 1&apos;ennemi est principaiement represent^ par lebenefice du fabricant. Oe benefice en fait reste consigne en Angleterre. Or, cetelement est-il assez important pour jusfifier les dangers militaires, politiques et morauxd&apos;un arret de notre activite ihdusorielle ?Mon Gouvernement ne ie croit pas. II est plutot d&apos;ayis que les efforts des Alliesdoivent tendre a encourager la mngnifique resistance opposee a 1&apos;oppresseur par laclasse ouvriere et a empecher, par tous les moyens, 1&apos;augmentation du nombre deschomeurs, afin de ne pas fortifier indument 1&apos;ennemi.D&apos;ailleurs, il y a lieu de faire remarquer que 1&apos;eifet moral de 1&apos;arret des industriesen question seraib desastreux. L&apos;adversah*e ne manquerait pas d&apos;expioiter a son profitcette situation; ii eu rejettera les responsabilites sur les Allies, qui, en exigeant lebloquage a 1&apos;etranger du produit de la vente des marohaudises, out prive les industrielsbeiges des capitaux necessaires a la bonne marche de leurs affaires. II aura soin dese poser en defendeur de 1&apos;industrie nationale et d&apos;affirmer qu&apos;en imposant la rentreetotale des fonds il cherche a la proteger contre les Allies eux-memes.II iraporte de dejouer cette manoeuvre. La situation est grave. Elle exige uneprompte intervention des autorites britauniques.line soule solution me parait possible. Elle consiste a autoriser la rentreesubsequente de la so mine totale consignee en Angleterre et a permettre a nos industrielsd&apos;acquitter la taxe de sortie.La consignation prealable du prix de vente permettra aux autorites anglaisesd&apos;exercer le meme controle qu&apos;qu&apos;auparavant sur la destination ultime des produitsprovenaut de Belgique. Et on peut espei*er que, si Ton autorise le rapatriemehtsubsequent des fonds bloques, les autorites allemandes seront amenees a se departirde leur severite et consentiront peut-etre a modifier la formule de declaration imposeeaux exportateurs.Toutefois, si cette solution ne paraissait pas possible, on pourrait creer un regimede tolerance base sur les points suivants:1. Les autorites anglaises ne creeront pas de difficultes aux industriels quiauront cru devoir signer la formule exigee par les Allemands ;2. Les exportateurs beiges seront autorises a payer la taxe de sortie;3. Les industriels pourront, si la necessite les y oblige, emprunter en Hollande ladifference entre le pourcentage autorise et la valeur des mar-marchandises exportees, maisdans ce cas les industriels feront connaltre au Comite officiel pour le Commerce beigeles montants exacts qu&apos;ils empruntent afin qu&apos;il puisse, suivant la procedure ordinaire,en informer les autorites anglaises.Je suis convaincu que le Gouvernement britannique ne voudra pas exposer nospopulations a des souffrances et a des perils encore plus grands, resultats d&apos;unchdmage general, et qu&apos;il consentira a introduire dans les conditions que reglent1&apos;exportations de nos marchandises la modification suggeree.
En acquiescant a cette detnande, votre Excellence rendra a mes oornpatriotes, sieprouves par vingt-huit mois de guerre, un service dont ils lui sauront le plusgrand gre.Je saisis, &amp;c.HYMANS.Annexe.Declaration d&quot;Engagements pom&apos; les Exportations vers I Outre-mer.Nous soussignes, , prenons vis-a-vis duDepartement pour le Commerce et lTndustrie, Bureau du Commerce exterieur(Aussenhandelstelle), les engagements suivants :1.

APPENDIX II.WORK OF COMMISSION FOR&apos; RELIEF IN BELGIUM ANDGERMAN GUARANTEES.(I.)Memorandum by Lord Robert Cecil dated December 22, 1916.1. I CIRCULATE herewith a memorandum on the present position in regard tothe relief of Belgium and Northern France together with a draft of a note which Ipropose to address to the United States and Spanish Ambassadors and the NetherlandsMinister as patrons of the neutral commission for relief in Belgium. The object of this draft is to bring some extra pressure to bear upon the Germans by publicity, and it will therefore have to be published. Its publication will no doubt lead to certain criticismsin this country of the Governments policy, and it should therefore be seen by theCabinet before it is sent. Most people in this country, whatever doubts they may feelas to the benefit drawn by the Germans from the relief commission&apos;? activities,recognise it as a policy necessitated by our obligations to the French and belgian governments, and the criticism, though it may be strong in some limited circles,would probably therefore not be widespread.Memorandum.1. The annexed draft note to the neutral representatives who are patrons of therelief commission gives an outline of the history of the relief work in so far as thedevelopment of the German guarantees is concerned. The conclusions to which thishistory leads appear to be as follows : 2. The Germans seized a large amount of foodstuffs and live-stock in the firstmonths of their occupation of Belgium. This was chiefly before the neutral reliefcommission had fairly commenced its operations, and it is believed that theseseizures were not very important after the beginning of 1915. They were startedagain on a large scale, so far as live-stock was concerned, in the late autumn of 1915, and between that time and March .1916 large numbers of cattle, andprobably a considerable number of pigs, were taken by the Germans. Requisitionsand forced sales played a certain part in these months, but by far the larger part ofthe depletion of live-stock probably took the form of sales in the open market,since the peasants were selling their live-stock on a large scale owing tothe shortage of prepared feeding-stuffs, of which Belgium normally imports avery large quantity. This depletion of live-stock was temporarily stopped by theGerman guarantees of April 191.6, but the purchases and exports recommenced last october. The German civil authorities at Brussels have taken certain measures against these violations of the guarantees, and it is, on the whole, the opinion of the americans that those authorities are genuinely anxious to preserve Belgian resources, but thatthey cannot control the military authorities. They cannot, for instance, control thelarge purchases of butter, eggs, cheese, and vegetables by German regiments quarteredin different parts of Belgium, nor can they control the purchases of live-stock made bythe garrisons at, for instance, Louvain and Liege.3. As regards foodstuffs, other than meat and live-stock, the wheat and rye harvestsof 1915 and 1916 have been completely reserved to the Belgian population, and itmay be roughly said that the Germans have taken none of these crops. The sameapplies to barley. In both years, &quot;however, it proved impossible to preserve the variousfodder crops, which were all taken by the Germans, with the exception of the quantitiesleft to the cultivators for their own animals. The nett amounts secured by theGermans are believed to have been small, because crops were much below normal.[U65-27] D
As regards potatoes, it is certain that the Germans attempted to control the 1915 cropmore or less in the interests of the Belgian population, but they made a mess of their control, with the result that the peasants hid large quantities of potatoes or left themto rot in the ground. The result was a great shortage of potatoes. In addition, it is certain that the Germans took considerable quantities of potatoes, but, on the whole, itis improbable that those quantities amounted to any. very important figure. There is little information as to the amount of minor produce which they may have obtained in1915, but, in virtue of the exception made, to the guarantees of the 14th April, theGermans themselves say that, in the nine months from the establishment of the so-called&quot;Fruit Centrale&quot; down to August 1916, there had been exported from Belgium28,000 tons of fruit and vegetables. The Germans claim that, in comparison with thenormal export of fruit and vegetables from Belgium, which they place at over100,000 tons, this export cannot be considered as anything else but a surplus over and above the needs of the population. The reasoning is of course absurd, and we have now,after prolonged negotiations, secured Belgian representation on the chief &quot; Centrales &quot;(i.c, the German commissions controlling various native produce), and from that basiswe should be able more or less to fight any German claims in the future that there is any surplus of any kind of native Belgian produce. At the same time, the export of 28,000 tonsof fruit and vegetables, consisting largely of such vegetables as chicory, rhubarb, andasparagus, need perhaps not very seriously concern us. Finally, there is no doubtthat in the local markets and, to a certain extent still, by isolated requisitions on asmall scale, German soldiers are obtaining, for the use of the local occupying forces,considerable quantities of vegetables, butter, eggs, and cheese. For the last eight months or so our information as to the disposal of native produce in Belgium has been fairly complete, owing to the fact that we haye been receiving regularly the detailedreports of the Commission^ Bureau of Inspection and Control, which records even the.smallest reqirisitions of or interference with native supplies over the whole ofBelgium, except the military zone in East and West Flanders and Hainaut.4. There has never been any cause for anxiety as to the imported foodstuffs,which have always been respected by the Germans.5. As regards Northern France, the problem is much simpler, since before therelief commission began its work in that territory in March 1915 the Germans hadalready taken practically the whole native foodstuffs of the country. They obtained agood deal of the harvest in Northern France in 1915, but this year more satisfactoryconditions have been wrung from them, and they themselves claim that, taking intoaccount the fact that the harvest there fell considerably below expectation, the Frenchpopulation is now receiving practically the whole produce of the soil.6. The upshot of the whole matter is that, however strong a fight the neutralcommission may, with our support, be able to put up against the Germans from timeto time in Belgium, and whatever measures we may be able to wring from the Germansfor the enforcement of their guarantees, there is little or no prospect of permanentlyputting a stop to exports of Belgian live-stock, and from time to time these exportswill reach a considerable figure. They will then be temporarily reduced or even cut off,in reply to vigorous protests, only to begin again within a few weeks. Whatever doubtsmay be felt as to whether, in fact, the Germans would have taken any less from Belgiumif the relief commission had never existed, it is impossible not to admit that, as thingsstand at the present moment, the relief commission^ imports into Belgium are to acertain extent, in replacement of food taken by the Germans. The present policy ofHis Majest3^&apos;s Government is to reduce these imports so far as possible by makingimmediately available to the population as large an amount as possible of nativefoodstuffs. To that end, we are endeavouring to secure the consent of the BelgianGovernment to a demand upon the Germans that they shall cancel a decree issuedabout a year ago prohibiting the slaughter of young cattle. From a purelyadministrative point of view, this decree has been very successful, and the result hasbeen that in the last twelve months the total head of cattle in Belgium has notdecreased, but the withdrawal of a large amount of live-stock from the market inconsequence is one of the factors which keep imports at their present high level, andthere can be little doubt that the Germans are keeping these reserves of live-stock asan insurance against a possible stoppage of imports, with the full intention of seizingall the live-stock of the country before they retreat from Belgium. But even if theGerman decree is rescinded and imports are reduced, we cannot feel any certainty that exports will not take place on a considerable scale.7. In view of our relations with the Belgian and French Governments (for if therelief of Belgium were stopped, the relief of Northern France could not be continued)
it seems difficult, if not impossible, to stop the relief work now, and it is indeed hardly&quot;conceivable that, if we were to do so, the Belgian Government would face a prolongation&apos; of the war, especially as the Germans are probably prepared to offer them now acomplete restoration of their independence together with a reconstruction indemnity.Though we have often used the threat of stopping imports in order to put pressure onthe Germans, we have always recognised that, for this reason, it was&apos; a weapon toodangerous for us to use.8. The whole question is therefore submitted to the Cabinet as frankly an extremely unsatisfactory one, but as one to which, in spite of the disadvantages whichit entails upon the Allies, there appears to be no rough-and-ready solution.R. C.Foreign Office, December 22, 1916.(2.)Draft for Consideration by tlie Cabinet.My dear Ambassador/Minister, Foreign Office, December    , 1916.I HAVE frequently had to communicate with you on the subject of the observa-tion of the German guarantees under which the work of the neutral commission for relief in Belgium is carried on.You will recollect that the original guarantee given by the German government when this work was first set on foot at the end of October 1914 was merely that thefoodstuffs imported by the neutral commission should be free from all requisition andseizure. Immediately thereafter, how-ever, on the 31st December, 1914, the GermanGovernment gave a guarantee that there should be no requisition or seizure of anynative foodstuffs in Belgium which wrould have to be replaced by the importations ofthe neutral commission. During the six months following that guarantee theneutral commission assured His Majesty&apos;s Government that these guarantees werebeing reasonably well observed, but in the summer of 1915 it became necessary tomake further arrangements covering the native harvest in Belgium. These arrange-in ents resulted in the giving of various comprehensive guarantees by the german authorities covering the native harvest, the general freedom of the neutral commis-sion to conduct the work of relief unhampered, and more particularly the freedom of workmen in Belgium to accept relief from the commission without any coercion oftheir labour by the German authorities. In the month of November 1915 the neutralcommission became no longer able to&quot; assure His Majestj^s Government that theGerman Governments guarantees of the 31st December were being properly carriedout, and they could not deny the truth of the reports which reached His Majesty&apos;sGovernment regarding the export of large quantities of lnre-stock to Germany and tothe army in Northern France. On the 31st December, 1915, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment were therefore obliged to ask the neutral commission and the patron ministers to extend and strengthen their arrangements With the German authorities so as to prohibit absolutely the export from Belgium of all Belgian foodstuffs, live-stock, andother articles necessary to the maintenance of Belgian agriculture. The negotiations on this subject were long and complicated, but they finally resulted in the giving bythe Germans on the 14th April last of certain comprehensive guarantees entirelyprohibiting the export or the use by the occupying army of Belgian native produce and live-stock. The only exception recognised to these guarantees was that the questionof the export of Belgian chicory or other vegetables of which there was an admittedsurplus might be left for subsequent consideration on its merits.3. For about six months from the giving of these guarantees, the neutral corn-mission was able to assure His Majesty&apos;s Government that they wrere being reasonably well observed, but latterly, as at the same time last year, there had been a greatrecrudescence of food exports, and live-stock has been purchased in large quantitiesfor the consumption of the occupying army. Even before this time the german authorities had construed the exception made to the guarantees of 14th April, aspermitting the export of excessive quantities of vegetables of various kinds, andpurchases of butter and vegetables by the occupying army have been conducted on alarge scale. These accumulated occurrences became the subject of strong representa-tions from the patron ministers and the neutral commission. In reply to these representations, the German authorities at Brussels have assured the patron ministers
that they have taken certain measures to check illicit exports of live-stock and food-stuffs through certain Belgian frontier towns, aud to prevent movements of suchfoodstuffs by rail in the vicinity of the frontier. According, however, to reports whichreach His Majesty&apos;s Government, and which are not denied by the neutral commission,the consumption of Belgian live-stock as well as of important minor products, such asbutter and vegetables, by the occupying army continues unchecked, and the whole situation can only be regarded as absolutely unsatisfactory, and must clearly have been caused either by deliberate bad faith or by continued administrative inefficiency on thepart of the German authorities.I must leave it to your Excellency to explain to your Government the full facts ofthe situation as recorded in the numerous communications between the patronministers and the German authorities, which are in your possession, but I shall be glad if your Excellency will transmit to your Government an urgent appeal to intervenestrongly in defence not of the policy of the Allied Governments, which is not here inquestion but in defence of the whole system of guarantees built up by the neutralcommission, which guarantees have been solemnly given by the German Governmentto the United States, Spanish, and Netherlands representatives at Brussels. Thelocus standi of the Allied Governments in this matter is not that of their belligerentpolicy, which it is for them to carry on and to defend, aud with which neutral Govern-ments can, of course, in the nature of things, have nothing to do ; but it is the positionof the Allied Governments as parties to agreements with the neutral commission, acting on behalf of the civilian population of Belgium, which the neutral commission is nolonger able to carry out in view of the attitude of the German authorities.APPENDIX HI.RELIEF OF BELGIUM.Memorandum by Lord Robert Cecil, dated, the 3rd January, 1917.1. WITH reference to the memorandum regarding the relief of Belgium, which I circulated on the 22nd December, I add the following note on a further subject of controversy which has arisen.2. An additional portion of the province of Hainaut was recently transferred from the sphere of the Civil Government at Brussels and was added to the militaryzone. It is expected that Mons and parts of Belgian Luxemburg will be similarlytransferred, and there is a suspicion that gradually the whole of Belgium will beplaced under military administration.3. A difficulty has arisen in regard to the application of the guarantees to thesetransferred territories, and the Germans have hitherto refused to apply to the trans-ferred portion of Hainaut either tbe guarantees given by General von Bissing whichhad previously been enforced there, or the guarantee of rations of wheat ant 1 potatoeswhich apply in the military zone.4. In addition, in the north of France and the military zone in Belgium theGermans have shown a disposition to reduce the potato ration which they haveguaranteed to the population, on the ground of the general failure of the crops both inthe occupied territories and in Germany.5. We have addressed strong protests on both these subjects to the AmericanRelief Commission, and threatened to discontinue or restrict the work of relief. Amember of the Commission has left for Brussels and Berlin to put pressure on theGerman authorities. These protests were made at the suggestion of the ReliefCommission itself with a view to furnish a basis for such pressure.6. A time-limit of one month has been set for the reply.(InitiaUed) R.
