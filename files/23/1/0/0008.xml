The Chancellor of the Exchequer asked the authority of theWar Cabinet for the construction by the Shipjung Controller, onbehalf of the Government, of tramp steamers. He stated that theShipping Controller had been in communication with the Admiralty,and had come to an agreement with them as to the building of these ships. .decisions on the first two subjects Mr. Bonar Law retired and the Chair; was taken by-8] B
2Aircraft.Provision of high-powered engines for the british expeditionary force.The First Reportof the Air Board.The First Sea Lord stated that he was opposed to the building of very large merchant ships, owing to the activities of the enemy&apos;ssubmarines. He undertook to look personally into the details of thearrangements made between the Admiralty and the ShippingController.The War Cabinet decided in principle on the construction bythe State of merchant shipping, and authorised the Shipping Con-troller to proceed with his p&apos;ans subject to the condition that theAdmiralty were in complete agreement. In the event of any difference of opinion between the Board of Admiralty and theShipping Controller, the question should be brought back to theWar Cabinet.3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that he hadreceived several communications from the Commander-in-Chief ofthe British Expeditionary Force on the subject of the supply of air-craft. Sir Douglas Haig had expressed some anxiety owing to theincreased efficiency of the German aeroplanes, and laid the utmoststress on the importance of providing sufficient high-powered engines for next year.Lord Curzon, who stated that he was still acting as Presidentof the Air Board, reported to the Cabinet that this question hadbeen discussed at a very recent meeting. General Trenchardhad put forward his full requirements. It was clear that thestiperior resources of the Navy in high-powered engines rendered itcertain that the necessary additional supply for the british expeditionary Force could only be obtained from the Admiralty.The representatives of the Admiralty at the Air Board had shownevery desire to meet the requirements of the British ExpeditionaryForce ; had at once promised to hand over a considerable part ofthe material needed ; and the remainder was left for discussion between the two Departments. For the moment, Lord Curzonconsidered that everything possible was being done to supply therequirements of the Army for next year. He hoped that it wouldbe possible to settle the questions raised in the first Report of theAir Board at an early date.The First Sea Lord informed the War Cabinet that the question was now under consideration by the First Lord and himself. he undertook to communicate with the Secretary as soon as theAdmiralty were prepared to discuss the question.El Arish.4. The War Cabinet discussed the political aspects of theforthcoming military operations against El Arish, which are setforth in the Note by the General Staff printed in Appendix II.Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Mark Sykes explained that, if theforthcoming operations proved successful, it was possible that the tribes east of the Medina Railway would rise, and, as the headquarters of these tribes were in the French sphere, as defined by the Agreement entered into by the French, Russian, and british governments, in the spring of this year, it was important to securethe French political co-operation.The War Cabinet decided that the Foreign Office should informthe French Government, with the utmost secrecy, of our intentions,that our sole object is to defeat the Turks, and that we should welcome their political co-operation, both in the international sphereand in any negotiations which may become necessary in the Frenchsphere of direct control, and in that of commercial and political interest.The War Cabinet also decided that we should do&quot; our utmost toavoid the association of any French troops with our own, since theGeneral Staff regard a mixed force as objectionable for many reasons,political and military.
The Balkans. 6. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the WarCabinet that the French force at Salonica only amounted to 111,000men, and was much below strength. In spite of their shortage ofdrafts, the French intended to send two more divisions, though itwas difficult to see how they were to be transported in the presentshipping situation. He read an extract from General Jofl&apos;re&apos;s orders to General Sarrail to the following effect: -(a.) The army to be established in a strong position which willenable it to withstand any attack that may be made bythe enemy, and which may serve as a base for an ultimate resumption of the offensive.(6.) Not to  abandon, except  under military necessitj7,  the territories which it holds in pledge,(e.) To maintain itself in a position, in case of necessity, to takerapid action against Greece.&apos;Sir William Robertson stated that he did not much like these orders, and proposed to make a further communication to general off re.The Arab Revolt, 5. Since the 11th December, when the War Cabinet authorisedRariegh and Yenbo. Sirdar to despatch an infantry brigade with the necessaryartillery, engineers, medical services, &amp;c, to Rabegh (provided thathe was satisiied that this force is sufficient; that it can be supplied with water and all necessities; and that there is still time for thepreparation of an entrenched position at Rabegh), the information has been somewhat conflictingThere appears to be no doubt, however, about the followingfacts : The Sherif, after cancelling a previous application for theimmediate despatch of six European battalions, asked Colonel Wilson,on the 11th December, i&apos;or a British brigade to be kept at Suez or PortSudan ready to proceed immediately on his request. At the sametime, he stated his immediate need to be 1,500 Moslem troops forRabegh and 500 for Yenbo. This request was repeated on theJ 3th December. The Sirdar reported on the latter date that hecould send no more Moslem troops from the Egyptian Army inEgypt, or from the Sudan, and that the Naval Commander-in-Chief,East Indies station, reported that it would take some time to collectsufficient transports to convey a brigade from Suez to either Rabeghor Port Sudan, and that the retention of troops on board the transports in the latter port for an indefinite period was renderedimpracticable by the shortage of sea transport. In the presentcircumstances, if Rabegh or Yenbo were attacked by the Turks inforce, the Sirdar intended to evacuate the Egyptian detachments and stores at these places, and was making preparations for thisemergency.The War Cabinet decided that the Foreign Office should send atelegram to the Sirdar in the following sense : That the Government realised that the responsibility forthe possible collapse of the Sherifs movement would rest withhim, owing to his final refusal of military assistance, which wewere prepared to send in response to his earlier request.The Sirdar was informed that he had the authority ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government to arrange for sending a Britishbrigade and a French contingent to Rabegh, if transport couldbe provided, and if he was satisfied as regarded conditionsnamed to him in earlier telegrams.The Sirdar was also authorised to inform the Sherif, if hethought it prudent to do so, that the Sinai offensive would takeplace immediately, and to indicate to him the assistance whichmight result from this, especially if the Arab tribes in SouthernPalestine could be induced to rise against the Turks.
The War Cabinet have nothing to add to their decision on the9th December, when they authorised the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff to inform General Joffre that the situation in the balkans caused them considerable anxiety (War Cabinet, No. 1,Minute 1). They authorised the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff, in communicating with General Joffre, to make such furtheruse of this decision as he thought fit.The Transport ofRailway Aiaterialto France.7. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that, inconsequence of the arrangement sanctioned for the reduction ofrailway facilities, the rolling-stock, locomotives. &amp;c, required forthe railways in France, would be forthcoming more rapidly thanthe transport to carry them.The First Sea Lord Undertook to examine this question atonce.(vjroeno S.

Hodge, M.P.,Minister of Labour.10- The Labour Minister made a statement to the War Cabinetregarding the strike of boiler-makers at Liverpool. An abstract ofthis statement is given in Appendix IV.The War Cabinet approved the policy proposed by the labour minister, that is to say, not to negotiate until work had been resumed ;to issue a warning under the Munitions Act and the Defence of the realm Act; to follow this by a proclamation and the arrest of threemen, in the first instance, against whom evidence of a breach of thelaw was available ; to undertake house-to-house visitation with theobject of providing protection for the men who wish to work, andof isolating the strikers ; and for the reinforcement of the localpolice.(Initialled)    &apos; A.

Deducting the operating expenses, say, 20.000Z. per month, would leave, a net profit to the owners of117,000Z., equal to 1,400,OOOZ. a year. The time charter rate to-day is really higherthan the above figure. The builders of these boats, viz., the Kawasaki DockyardCompany, refuse to charter because they have incurred a great deal of financialexpenditure in building these and later vessels, and wish to clear off their loans.The price the owner is asking is 105 American dollars per ton, which, at thepresent rate of exchange, works out at nearly.i5,2OO,O0(*Z. I have, asked for a firm offerat 3.000,00OZ., payment 1,000,000Z. in cash, the balance in British Government securities,with an undertaking that these securities will not be negotiated or sold in the UnitedKingdom either or anywhere else for a period of three years from the date of the contract, or for a period of one year after the conclusion of the war, at the option ofthe seller. Alternatively, I have asked for an offer at 3,000,0O0Z., payment in -Japanesesecurities, on the chance that, under the Deposit of Security Scheme, the treasury may have that amount on hand.The same firm have an additional twelve steamers building for delivery the last half of 1917, and, if business results on the above steamers, I would stipulate that theyshould give us the option of the remaining twelve steamers for delivery the latter partof next year at a reduced price for the whole twenty steamers, or, failing this, toundertake to give us the first offer of the vessels before disposing of them elsewhere.The above figure of 3,00O,00OZ. would be equivalent to about 38Z. 14s. per ton.December 9, 1916.APPENDIX II.El Arish Operations.Note by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff.Operations will shortly be begun in the Sinai Desert with the immediate objects of occupying El Arish, thence a further advance on Rafa is projected. Subsequentoperations must depend upon circumstances, and we desire to have liberty to follow up any success we may achieve.If our advance is continued beyond Bafa the international sphere as defined by theagreement entered into by the French, Russian, and British Governments in the spring of this year would become part of the theatre of operations. It would therefore seem desirable that the French Government should be informed, with the utmost secrecy, ofour intentions, otherwise the reason for the operations may be misinterpreted by themin view of their well-known susceptibilities in regard to Syria.The French might also be informed that our sole object is to defeat the Turks, andthat we should welcome their political co-operation both in the international sphereand in any negotiations which may become necessary in the French sphere of direct control, and in that of commercial and political interest. We should, however, do our utmost to avoid the association of any French troops with our own, as a mixed force is,for many reasons, political and military, always objectionable.General Staff, December 14, 1916.[1365-8]C
.. Telegram to Sir F. Elliot (Athens).You should propose to your colleagues that, if Greek Government return asatisfactory reply to the ultimatum within the time laid down, a further communication should be addressed to -that Government in the following terms : &quot; The representatives of France, Great Britain, Italy, and Russia have the.honourto take note with satisfaction of the reply- returned to their communication of.14th December. They have now the honour to invite the assent of the GreekGovernment to the following demands for guarantees of security and reparation, suchas were foreshadowed in the conclusion of the above-mentioned communication : &quot; 1. The prohibition of all meetings of reservists in Greece north of the Isthmusof Corinth, whether in the form of leagues or of political or social clubs, and theprohibition against all civilians carrying fire-arms in xmblic:&quot; 2. The re-establishment of the various Allied controls, the form of which will bediscussed with the Greek Government, in order that they.may be rendered as littlevexatious as possible.&quot; Reparation.&quot; 1. All Venizelists who have been imprisoned to be immediately released, and compensation paid to those who have suffered unjustly.&quot;2. The institution of full enquiries by a Special Court of Enquiry into the events of 1st and 2nd December, the punishment of all those found guilty of excesses on thosedays, and compensation for any destruction or damags done to the property of allied nationals. The Greek Government shall consult the Allies as to the composition and procedure of the Court of Enquiry, so as to ensure its effectiveness and rigidimpartiality.&quot; 3. The dismissal of the officer responsible for having failed to carry out the written assurances given by the King to French Admiral on 28th November.&quot; 4. The Greek Government to offer a formal apology to the Ministers of the Allies,and the British, French, Italian, and Russian flags to be formally saluted in a publicsquare at a full parade of the garrison at Athens.&quot;We are unaware of the number and nature of the Greek forces that will remain in and near Athens, and in other parts of Northern Greece outside Thessaly and Epirus,assuming that the demands put forward in the note verbale of the Military Attaches arecomplied wdth. It is, in our view, of great importance that these forces should, ifpossible, be reduced to the number absolutely necessary for police purposes, and ademand to this effect should be put forward as the first and most important guarantee against the renewal of disturbances similar to those that occurred on 1st and 2ndDecember, but we are unable to suggest the form that this demand should take until we have fuller information on the point.Please therefore let us have immediately all the facts relevant to this question.APPENDIX IV.Abstract of Statement by the Labour Minister.The whole question of the boiler-makers&apos; strike had been discussed at a recent conference at which Mr. Hodge had been present. It was.his opinion that it wouldbe a great mistake to apprehend and deport participators in the strike. sufficient evidence was available to justify the prosecution in the ordinary course of three men.From his experience, he thought that the only way to deal with strikes of this naturewas to refuse to negotiate with men who had thrown down their tools. Therefor, his reply to a proposal that he should receive a deputation of strikers was that resump-tion of work must precede any discussion. The Secretary of the Boiler-makers&apos; Societyhad assured him that the men would return to work, and the Assistant Secretary had
invited him to address a mass meeting. To do this would be, he felt, to weaken onhis first reply, as the fundamental practice was, in his view, never to treat with strikersnntil they had resumed work.   He therefore endorsed his first &quot;reply.The character of the speeches made at the strikers&apos; meetings was such as couldnot be allowed, as it suggested that the men would get their own way if they onlystood together. The men wanted an increased war bonus which would bring the total amount to 11s. He had suggested that if the men went back to work the matter might go before a local arbitration board. There was a difference between men and employers on the Mersey on the question of war bonus, and the naval authorities were much concerned about prospective troubles. A. conference had been held between theMinistry of Munitions, the Admiralty, and the Labour Adviser, audit had been decidedto administer one section of the Munitions Act and one section of the Defence of the realm Act.printed at the foreign office bt c. r. harrison. 23/12/1916.
