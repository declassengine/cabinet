Man-Power.Report of theDirector ofNational Service.Agriculture.Mining.Munitions.Railways.Relation withMinistry ofMunitions.General.1. THE War Cabinet considered tbe Report of the Director-General of National Service (Appendix I), and decided :-r-(a.) That 30,000 men now engaged in agriculture should bemade available for general service by the end of January,and that the Board of Agriculture, in consultation withthe War Office, should make arrangements, wherebyevery man certified as indispensable by tbe County war agricultural Committee, who was called up for militaryservice, should be returned to agriculture, provided thatthe Board could furnish the recruiting authority wirh a substitute fit for general service drawn from agriculturalemployment within one week.(6.) That the figure of 30,000 in the case of agriculture shouldnot be exceeded without fresh authority from theCabinet.(c.) lhat 20,000 men now engaged in mining should be madeavailable for general service by the end of January, andthat the War Office should consult with the Home office as to the melhod of selection.(d.) That 50,(K)0 semi-skilled and unskilled men now engagedin munition works should be made available for general service by the end of January, and that the Ministry ofMunitions should proceed with the measures already inoperation for this purpose.(e.) That the President ol the Board of Trade should considermeasures for releasing a further number of men fromthe railways.(/.) That the Director and Minister of Munitions in consultationshould prepare a statement of their mutual relations andrespective powers and functions to replace paragraphs14, 16, and 21 of the Directors Report.*(g.) That the Director should submit a revised scheme of organisation embodying the results of the discussion,and based on the following general principles : (i.) That, subject to the decisions in paragraphs (a)to (d), the Director should proceed as in Part Iof his report by releasing for the Armyall men of 18 to 22, but scheduling as exempt from military recruiting within those ages menin those occupations which are found to be of vital national- importance, i.e., men employedin the production of steel, in the occupationscovered by the trade card scheme, and inagriculture, mines and quarries, railway shops,transport work, and shipyards,(ii.) That the Director should have full authority,subject to appeal to the War Cabinet, to decide on the relative claims for men put forward bythe several Departments, including the WarOffice, and to require them to transfer orrelease labour which might in his view bemore usefully employed elsewhere.(iii.) That the Recruiting Department of the War office should not be transferred to the Director.(iv.) That the Employment Exchanges should remain under the control of the Minister of Labour,who undertook, to place them at the disposalof the Director for the organisation of NationalService.* The War Cabinet resumed its sittings at this point at 3-30, and proceeded withthe further consideration of the Directors Report (Minute 1), Ministers andMr. N. Chamberlain only being present.
Calling up of Menunder 19.*2. The Adjutant-General was authorised to proceed with his proposal to call up men of 18 (Appendix Hj.Instructions toLocal Tribunals.*3. The Local Government Board were authorised to proceedwith the issue of their Circular R. 113, and annexed R. 114 andand R. 115 (Appendix III).Man-Power in home defence units.4. The War Office undertook to reconsider immediately thenumber, classification, and use of the men retained in this countryfor Home Defence, and to report to the War Cabinet on the subject,.with a view particularly to considering whether better use could bemade of them in assisting necessary work.Man-Power Behind 5. The War Cabinet decided to take into consideration at anthe Lines. early date, after receiving a similar report, the question of replacingImported Labour.     by coloured labour a proportion of the men now engaged on servicesbehind the lines abroad.(Initialled) D.

REPORT BY DIRECTOR-GENERAL OF NATIONAL SERVICE TOTHE WAR  CABINET.Part I. The Military Situation.1. I HAVE to report that I have examined, as fully as the time at my disposalhas permitted, the whole question of the requirements and resources of man power asthey exist to-day. I am satisfied that the greatest and most urgent requirement is toprovide for the Army men who are fit for General Service. If the forces in the fieldare to be maintained in the months of Ap&apos;il, May, and June, it is necessary for theArmy to&apos; receive in January 100,000 Category &quot;A&quot; recruits, in February 120,000, inMarch 130,000 ; the total for the first quarter of the-year is thus no less than 350,000Category &quot;A&quot; men. in addition, the Army requires in January 40,000 recruits ofCategories &quot; B&quot; and &quot; C,&quot; in February 30,000, and in March 30,000 of the samecategories, a total of 100,000 &quot; B &quot; and C &quot; men for three months. The grand total for the same peiiod is therefore 450,000 men.There are at present, in civil life, according to the most recent W^ar Office figures which have been obtained from a count of the Military Registers, 3,071,573 men ofmilitary age. Of these the War Office estimates that approximately 1,800,000 are fit for General Service, that 1,500,000 are fit for one or other of the remaining medicalcategories, and that the balance, of between 300,000 and 400,000 men, is unfit for any form of Military Service.Further, the War Office estimates that of the men&apos; born in 1895, 1896, 1897, and1898 remaining in civil life, 280,000 are fit for General Service.2. In order to meet the immediate and pressing demand of the Army, I recommendthat a general order be issued to the effect that ail exemptions held by men born in1895, 1896, 1897, and 1898, and issued to them by or under the authority of Govern-ment Departments he forthwith cancelled.Further, I recommend that an instruction be issued to tribunals to the effect thatit is in the national interest that no man who was^born in one or other of the yearsenumerated shall hold a Tribunal Certificate of Exemption unless bis case be a most exceptional one of individual hardship, or unless he be, for some peculiar reason, reallyindispensable to the nation in civil lile.Still further, I recommend that it be announced by the Prime Minister that thecircumstances attending every exemption granted by tribunals to men of these yearsof birth shall be the subject of special inspection and investigation by the Government.3. Among the men whose exemptions would be cancelhd in. this way there would of necessity be an appreciable number of skilled men belonging to one or other of the skilled engineering trades. To prevent the nation losing the benefit of their technicalskill, I rec-ommf-md that a definite instruction be issueci by the Cabinet to the WarOffice to the effect that no man who becomes available for recruitment under theproposed general order, and who posses^es real individual technical skill as a metalworker, is to be employed in the Army in any capacity in which his skill is nut fullyutilised, and if it cannot be so utilised that he be relegated 10 the reserve forthwith.I am informed that the War Office has developed a scheme of trade testing whichis working satisfactorily, and that under it men who are in possession of a degree ofskill not immediately required in the Army are passed to Class &quot; T &quot; Army Reserve. Iam also informed that, an arrangement exists between the War Office and the Ministryof Munitions wliei-eh)&apos; skilled men who fall into the net of the recruiting authorities can,if they are really of outstanding value to the Ministry, be claimed by that department as very necessary to them. The claims which the Ministry puts forward are, Iunderstand, arranged in three grades of urgency and the degree of urgency, togetherwith the man&apos;s skill balanced against the needs of the Army, determine his disposal.As a whole this arrangement appears to be working satisfactorily. I would suggestthat these arrangements be continued in the case of the men made available by theproposed general order, and that if weaknesses are hereafter discovered steps should betaken by the War Office to see that its local representatives do not knowingly withdraw from civil life any skilled man of the skilled engineering trades, unless he be required-in his skilled capacity as an artificer in one or other of the technical corps.4. In this connection, too, the provisions of the Trade Card Agreement entered.
into by Mr. Austen Chamberlain, Mr. Montagu, and Mr. Henderson, on behalf of thelate Government and certain of the Engineering Unions, is of considerable importance.As, &apos;however, the trade cards are in fact certificates of exemption granted by a Govcrn-ment (the War office, they would be withdrawn from the men affected by toegeneralorder in the same way as all other certificates of exemption issued by a GovernmentDepartment.It would therefore be necessary to confer with the Trad^ Unions concerned, and, ifpossible, obtain their concurrence, in the modifications of their agreements necessary toobtain the men required. It might be pointed out to them in this connection that,although under the proposal now put forward the Trade Card Agreement wool i be prejudiced to the extent that the certificates held by men of the years of birthenumerated above would lose their validity the men themselves would not cease to beemployed in the nation&apos;s interests, in a skilled capacity, either in civil life or m theArmy, as the army needs might determine.5. It will be noted that miners, quarrymen, men employed in the primary,processes of the Metai Trades and in Shipyards would all be equally affected by such ageneral order. This obvioudy raises difficulties, but it is impracticable to set up and toset in motion the new and elaborate machinery which would be necessary in connectionwith any other scheme which I have been able to think or&apos; for obtaining the menrequire i for the Army within the short period in wnich they have to be recruited Ifany other scheme be tried, and there are several possible schemes, I am persuaded thatthe time absorbed in establishing the requisite machinery will make it impossible forthe War Odice t) obtain the men the Armv needs in time to train them. In other words, if the Armv is to be supplie t with men to carry on the spring and early summerfighting, without the iiievit ible hindrances and delays which must ensue if traineddrafts are n it available, a drastic step of the nature I have indicated must be taken andsome risks must be run.6. Having reviewed the situation as a whole, I am of opinion that the risksattendant upon the scheme proposed are in reality less than those which will attendany other method of obtaining the men within the limit of time imposed by the rapidpassing of the winter a cl the approach of spring.7. The scheme outlined above will, in mv opinion, render a sufficient number ofmen available for military service to be of very material assistance to the RecruitingDepartment in the months of January and February, and with the numbers of menwhom the War Office may reasonably expect to obtain from other sources it will makeit possible for the Adjutant-General to provide the drafts required in the, late spring.8. In February it may become obvious that a further general cancellation of certificates of exemption is necessary, or, it may be possible to devise in the intervalsome other scheme which will enable the recruiting needs in March to be met. Marchis from the point of view or&apos; recruiting the crisis of the year. After that month the requirement begins to fall; that for April is a 120,000 Category &quot; A&quot; recruits and20,000 recruits of Categories &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot;; in May 100,000 Category &quot; A &quot; recruitswiil be required and 10,000 men of Categories &quot;B&quot; and &quot; C in June 80,000Category &quot; A&quot; men are wanted and 10,000 men of Categories &quot; B:&apos; and &quot; C.&quot; At themoment it does not appear, necessary to make provision for the comparatively smallrequirements of July, August, and September. It is by no means impossible that theWar Odice will ne able to m et them without special assistance.9. The effect of withdrawing from civil life the mass of men requited by the Armyin the early months of the year will be to create an urgent demand for men in theessential civil industries. The procedure under which it is proposed to meet this demand in. so far as it can be met from civil sources is detailed in Part II of thisreport. It must be remembered, however, that the Army is itself a source from whichreinforcements for industry can be drawn, for it is continually degrading men fromCategory &quot; A &quot; to Categories &quot; B,&quot; &quot; C,&quot; and &quot; E,&quot; and further the heavier the fighting was six, seven, or eight months ago the greater is the volume of definitive degradationand consequently the greater is the volume of the return flow to civil life. It is likely,therefore, that the return flow from the Army to civil life will tend to grow in volumefrom now onward. This, to some extent, will help, to meet the civil demand whichrecruiting for the Army will create.10. It is especially to be noted that thd scheme for Army Recruitment put forwardpre-supposes that in the earhy summer the Army Council will exercise its legal rightof sending overseas in its drafts, a certain number of young men who will not have completed their 19th year.This follows upon the inclusion of the men born in 1898 in the proposed general order.[1365--39] &quot;   &quot; C
11. Tf it be decided not to include these men but to maintain the practice of notBending any man overseas until he has at least completed his liith year, it will benecess ry, if the requisite numbers of recruits are to be secured, to include in the general order the men born in 189 4 and 1894. Each of these years is rc presented in civil life by approximately o ,000 Category &quot;A&quot; men, as against a corresponding approximatefigure of 100,000 Category &quot;A&quot; men, born in the second-half of 18U8. From everypoiit of \ iew it seems desirable to include the younger men in the scheme ; first, because etheir withdrawal from et vii life in the drastic fashion now proposed would create lessdisturbance m indusiry tnan ihe withdrawal of a similar number of the older men;second, realise these vounsr men are much keener to serve than their seniors who areafter all, speaking broadly, tne men who in the days of voluntary enlistment had lessenthusiasm and less determination to fi^ht than their contemporaries.12. Concurrently with the foregoing proposals, the releasing of labour from semi-essentiiC and unessential industries will be expedited by the periodical revision of the list of cert fied occupations, and the Local Government Board have arranged to issue atonce fresh directions to Tribunals similar to those in the circular dated the 1stDecember, 1^16, but raising the age limit from &quot;under 26 years of age&quot; to under31 years of age.Part II. Proposals for Organisation of National Service.1. In order to provide the substitutes which may be found necessary to replacemen withdrawn from civil life for military purposes in consequence of the proceduredesciibed in Part I, and to provide the reinforcements which may be needed byessential industries, it is proposed to make a great patriotic appeal for recruits for national service.   It is suggested that this might be designated &quot; The Industrial Army.&quot;2. There will be a headquarters staff established, co-ordinating the military and civil sections in one building (St. Ermin&apos;s/).3. It is proposed to divide the country into areas, and for this purpose, in orderthat existing State administrative machinery may be utilised to the speediest and best advantage, this division will be that of the Employment Exchange Divisional Areas,eight in number.4. It is aho proposed to attach a National Service Commissioner to each area.5. The services of the L-.cal Government Board will be requisitioned in order thatall the facilities of the Leal authorities may be invoked fir enrolment of recruits at thetown halls, and that the assistance of their staffs may be readily available in thisconnection.6. 1 he organisation of the headquarters&apos; staff for meeting immediate requirements is already nearly completed on the following lines : National Service : Headquarters Staff : Provisional Arrangement.(All to be located at St. Ermin&apos;s Westminster.)D.

7. It is recommended that the Reserved Occupations Committee be attached to theNational Service Department ; this Committee was under the jurisdiction of the ManPower Distribution Board ui til that Board was dissolved and its powers transferred tothe Director-General of National Service.8. An appeal, to be successful, must be made in such a way as to arouse patrioticsentiments, and to achieve this it is proposed (a.) To enlist the aid ol&apos;the editors nf the leading newspapers by calling them intoconference with the Director-General fort n with ;(o.) To launch an advertising campaign by a Publicity Sub-Section of the Depart-ment, already arranged for the purpose;(c.) To supplement it, with the assistance of the Local Government Board, bycalling upon  all  local authorities to arrange public meetings, and toestablish local committees to organise local campaigns ;(d.) To utilise the services of all other suitable bodies, including Employers&apos; Federations,Trade Unions,War Savings&apos; Associations,Chambers of Commerce,&amp;c, &amp;c.9. The machinery for enrolment will be : (a.) A District Commissioner (with Sub-Commissioners when necessary), torepresent the Director-General of National Service in each of the eightdistricts already indicated ;(6.) National Service Bureaux to be opened in municipal buildings throughout thecountry ;(c.) The bureaux to be staffed by local committees, assisted by experienced officers from the Employment Exchanges, who will ascertain and register thecapabilities of each volunteer enrolled ;(d.) The last day for enrolment to be the 28th February, 1917 ;(e.) Daily returns of enrolments, classilied, will be forwarded to the Director-General of National Service, to enable allocation to be made without delay.10. An outline of the enrolment plan is given in this diagram : D. G N. Sisstif s toEnrolment Department. Local Authorities.Appeal to enrol.

N. s.11. Volunteers will be asked : (a.) To state, when enrolling, the work for which they are best fitted, in order thatthey may be allocated to such work as far as possible.(b.) To sign an undertaking to serve anywhere in the United Kingdom, to take up any work indicated by the Director-General of National Service on theterms printed on the form.12. Volunteers now eligible for enrolment as War Munition Volunteers will beenrolled as such, signing the customary form.JPub &apos;ic.
13. The terms proposed are : (a.) The wages of volunteers to be the rates prevailing in the trade and establish-ment to which they are to be allocated, with a guaranteed minimum of25s. per week.(o.) Subsistence and other allowances to be at the same rates as those already given,to War Munition Volunteers.14. The Director-General, having satisfied himself of the necessity of any demandfor labour, will allocate to the Government Departments or firms the available supply,accordingly, the Director-General retaining the power to re-allocate, from time to time,the labour provided, or its equivalent, as the necessity for re-allocation arises.15. The actual transference of the labour allocated, as required by the newemployer, will be effected by the existing machinery of the Employment Exchanges,which should be transferred to the National Service Department for the period of thewar. It seems to be most desirable that the organisation which is to be mainly usedfor the purpose of local enrolment and the allocation of the volunteers should be underthe immediate control of the Director-General of National Service.16. Where suitable opportunities occur the men will be worked in squads, controlled by civilian officers selected from the volunteers, under the general directions of theDistrict Commissioner and his staff.17. The duties of each District Commissioner would include : (a.) Examination and report to the Director-General on the necessity, extent, and.   the degree of priority of demand for labour in his district, after conferringwith the representatives of any Government Department concerned.(b.) Investigation and settlement of complaints and appaals by employers and employees arising out of the use of National Service Volunteers, theCommissioner having powers to impose psnalties, not exceeding 31., for any breach of a volunteers enrolment undertaking,(c.) Determination of the amount of subsistence and other allowances payable tovolunteers under the terms of his enrolment.Note. For the purposes stated in (6) and (c) the Commissioner wouldbe assisted by Assessors equally representative of employers and workmen,on lines similar to those set out in the form signed by war munitionvolunteers.18. So far as can be seen at this stage, the above proposals would merge, without difficulty, into any compulsory scheme which may be found necessarj&apos;&apos; hereafter.19. A Commission of three experts has been appointed, and has begun to consider and report upon the statistical data of man power, &amp;c, prepared by the various government Departments, so that the Director-General of National Service may beinformed of the necessity or otherwise for farther steps to be taken to furnish him withparticulars of man and woman power available.(A Memorandum prepared by the Director of the Agricultural Section of theNational Service Department is annexed as Appendix A.)20. It is proposed to proceed as soon as possible to organise female labour on linesparallel to the foregoing proposals.21. The powers and obligations of the Man Power Distribution Board have alreadybeen transferred to the Director-General of National Service, and to enable him to give full effect to the above scheme it will be necessary to invest him with further powers as follows : To determine all questions, which can be dealt with under the Acts, orders in Council, and Regulations now in force or hereafter passed, relating to theorganisation, utilisation, and transfer of male and female civilian labour for thepurpose of providing the necessary man and woman power for naval and militaryoperations (as authorised from time to time by the War Cabinet! and the con-,continuation and development of industries; to issue Orders and Regulations, and tocreate the requisite machinery for giving full effect to such determination.NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN, Director-General
Under the Military Service Act, 1916, section 2, it is provided that steps shall betaken to prevent, so far as possible, the sending of men to serve abroad before theyattain the age of 19.This is not a prohibition. It is open to the Army Council under this provision ifthe circumstances are such that men under 19 are required to be sent abroad to send them. It would be a matter to defend in Parliament, and it would lie on the militaryauthorities to satisfy Parliament that the step had been necessary in the national interest.The Statute does not apply to voluntarily attested men, but the same Parliamentaryconsiderations arise in their case.At present men are not called up under IS years and 7 months. Men of that agehave been called up with a view to being trained and ready for foreign service as andwhen they attain the age of 19. In view of the present recruiting position it is nowproposed to call up men of 13 years for immediate training, and to hold them availableto be sent abroad before 19, if diminution of other sources of supply of men for theArmy renders this course necessary. Probably the intentions of the Army council with respect to these men will be raised in Parliament and the Press on the publicationof the Proclamation calling up men of 18, and the CouncLVs objects would have to be explained when Parliament meets.(Initialled)      C.F.N.M.,January 9, 1917. A.-G.APPENDIX III.Circular. R. 113.Local Tribunals.Appeal Tribunals.Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W.,Sir, January 1917.I AM desired by Lord Rhondda to state that he has been requested to informTribunals that it is of urgent importance that all men fit for general service(Category A) or garrison service abroad (Category B i) who can be spared without serious detriment to work of essential national importance or who have not other very strong grounds for exemption should be made available for military service as soon aspossible-at latest by the 31st March next in order that they may be put under training.If in any particular case the Tribunal consider that the man should be given ashort time to enable him or bis employer to make necessary arrangements before hejoins the Army, it is advantageous that they should not grant exemption, but should arrange with the military representative that the man shall not be called up before a stipulated date.2. A statement is enclosed (R. 114) which supersedes the similar statement issued on the 1st December (K. 107).   In view of this pronouncement of the Government,Tribunals will not be justified in exempting, beyond the 31st instant, on grounds of[1365-39] DAPPENDIX II.i _Foreign Service for Recruits under 19 Years oe Age.Note by the Adjutant-General.War Office, January 13, 1917.The Secretary, Committee of Imperial Defence.THE attached Minute is forwarded with the request from the Secretary of Statefor War that a decision may he obtained at the earliest possible moment.One month must elapse between the date on which the posters are put out, andthat on which men will become available.It is requested that, if possible, the decision may be communicated not later thanMondav the 15 th.(Signed)       C.

employment, any man under 31 years of age fit for general service (A) or garrisonservice abroad (B i), except in the special cases mentioned in the statement.Agriculture continues to be excluded from this arrangement.3. Difficulties have recently arisen with regard to exemptions in the boot trade.The matter has been specially considered, and the statement (R. 115) issued on the15th instant, sets out the decisions at which the several Departments concerned havearrived.I am, &amp;c.H. C. MONRO, Secretary.The Clerk or secretary to the Tribunal.R. 111.Men under 31 Years of Age.The Government, after a careful survey of the situation, have come to the definite conclusion that, as regards cases which come before Tribunals on grounds ofbusiness or employment, with the exceptions specified in (3) and (4) below, every manunder 31 years of age who is fit for general service (Category A) or for garrisonservice abroad (Category B i) will be, after the 31st instant, of more value to thecountry with the forces than he would lie in civil employment.2. Having regard to this pronouncement, Tribunals will not be justified inexempting beyond the 31st iustant, on the ground that it is expedient in the national interest that, he should continue in civil employment, any man under 31 years of age who is fit for general service or for garrison service abroad, unless he clearly comes within the exceptions specified in (3) or (4. below.3. The following are exceptions to the general rule : (a.) If the man belongs to one of the occupations specified in Appendix (A) to the list of Certified Occupations, skilled men in which are urgently requiredfor munitions or other work of essential national importance. A manshould not be exempted because in one of these occupations, unless he is engaged on work of essential national importance ; or becomes engaged onsuch work within fourteen days, or such extended period as the Tribunalmay allow ; or, in suitable cases, enrols as a War Munitions Volunteer. *(6.) If the man, with due regard to the age limits, is in a certified occupation.Any such case has to be dealt with in accordance with the special provisions relating to certified occupations.* &quot;(c.) If the man, though in one of the occupations mentioned above, is engaged on work of high national importance and possesses special qualifications forthat work which makes him manifestly irreplaceable. Exemptions underthis head should be rare, and should not be admitted unless the requiredconditions are clearly fulfilled.A. The policy here announced does not apply to agriculture.5. The special decision mentioned above with regard to men under 31 years ofage should not make the Tribunals less strict in deciding applications in respect ofmen above that age. The demand for men at all military ages who are fit for generalservic (A) or for garrison service abroad (B i; is so great that exemption is not justifiedunless supported on very strong grounds.Whitehall, S.W., January 1U17.R. 115.Wholesale Boot and Shoe (other than Slipper) Manufacture.- The Government Departments concerned have recently had under consideration the conditions in the Boot Trade, and it has been decided to alter the list of CertifiedOccupations in this Trade (see page 12, R.105).* Special attention is drawn to Section 2 of the introduction to the Certified List, which reads as follows: &quot; The only ground for making these reservations is that the men protected ate engaged on work ofnational importance. These reservations, therefore, are not intended to protect men who have a bad recordfor absenting themselves from work, and exemption should not be granted or continued in such cases.&quot;
