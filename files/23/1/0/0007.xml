Mr- falter Long,  the   Adjutant-General,   and   the Director of recruiting. nThe present position is that the adoption of compulsory national Service for all men up to the age of 60 years was approved in principle by the late War Committee on the 1st December, 1916,the late President of the Board of Trade dissenting. A Committee,with the late Minister of Munitions in the chair, was appointed to draft a Bill, and the late War Committee attached great importanceto the enactment of the necessary legislation before Christmas.The exact terms of their decision on the subject are printed inAppendix I. The Bill was prepared, though certain points ofprinciple still remain to be settled. The draft, with a covering memorandum by Mr. Montagu, was before the War Cabinet.In the absence of the Prime Minister the War Cabinet couldnot reach any final -decision on this complex and far-reachingsubject.   They were able, however, to make a useful preliminary[1365-7] B
Women.2. The War Cabinet were inclined to favour the inclusion ofwomen in the scheme of Compulsory National Service, although theywere informed that this would affect no less than 14,000,000 women and would involve the compilation of a new Register. If this were finally decided, there should be a Woman&apos;s Advisory Board attachedto the Directorate of National Service. Another alternative wassuggested, viz., that there should be a third branch of the directorate of National Service dealing solely with&apos; women and presided overby a lady.Ireland.3. In the absence of the Prime Minister, the War Cabinet didnot feel entitled to discuss so large a question of policy as theinclusion of Ireland in any scheme of Compulsory National Service.The Man-Power *Distribution Board.4. The War Cabinet had before them a letter, dated the13th December, 19.16, from the Man-Power Distribution Board,proposing that, in view of the concentration of all business relatingto labour under the new Ministry of Labour,- the Man-PowerDistribution Board should cease to exist.   (Appendix II.)The War Cabinet decided that, pending the settlement of thequestion of distribution of responsibilities in respect to man-powerbetween the different offices concerned, including the neio Ministryof Labour and the proposed Director of National Service, theMan-Power Distribution Board should continue to discharge its functions.Fifth Keport of theMan-Power Distri-bution Board.5. The War Cabinet decided that the questions discussed inthe Fifth Report of the Man-Power Distribution Board, dated the28th November, 1916, and which relate to the more efficientorganisation for dealing with miscellaneous offers of service in a professional, clerical, or  administrative  capacity, could not   besurvey of the question, and they reached the following provisional conclusions : (a.) A Director of National Service should be appointed who should be in charge both of the Military and Civil sideof Compulsory National Service.(b.) The Civil and the Military sides of the Directorate ofNational Service shoidd be entirely separate-that is tosay, the Director of National Service woidd have underhim a Military Director and a Civil Director, with a. clearline of demarcation between them. The object of thisproviso is to allay any suspicion that the adoption of compulsory National Service for Civil purposes would bring the persons affected under Military control.(c.) The functions of the Ministry of Labour and the Directorof National Service will have to be carefully defef l m atan early date. Mr. Henderson undertook to discuss this question xcith the new Labour Minister and hiscolleagues.(d.) No announcement should be made in regard to the Directorof National Service until the holder of the post has been nominated and the scope of his duties and responsibilitieshave been defined.[The members of the War Cabinet present were strongly of opinion that Mr. E. S. Montaguwould be a good selection for this post, andthey commend this suggestion to &quot;the con-sideration of the Prime Minister.]
finally settled until a decision had been reached in regard to thedistribution of responsibilities referred to in the previous paragraph.6. The War Cabinet decided that the India Office telegramsThe Circulation of relating to military matters, which were formerly circulated to^P018- Members of the Cabinet, should be ^ent to the same Heads of departments as in the case of Foreign Office, War Office, and admiralty telegrams and documents, as decided in paragraph lj ofthe Minutes of the 12th December (War Cabinet No.. 3),namely : The Members of the War Cabinet.The Secretary of State fOr Foreign Affairs.The Secretary of State for the Colonies.The Secretary of State for India. &apos;The Secretary of State for War.The First Lox-d of the Admiralty.The Minister of Blockade.The President of the Board of Trade.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,December 14, 1916.(Initialled)      C, of K.APPENDIX I.(Extract from the Proceedings of a War Committee held onNovember 30, 1916.)Compulsory With reference to the discussion on this subject on theNational Service.      21st November I W.C.-90, Conclusion 2), the War Committee havereceived the following proposals for the adoption of compulsory national service:  (i.) A proposal contained in Section XI of the Third Report ofthe Man-Power Distributio l Board,(ii.) A proposal contained in a memorandum by the Minister ofMunitions, dated the 15th November, 1916.(iii.)
