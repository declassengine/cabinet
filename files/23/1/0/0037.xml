The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that thePortuguese Division was ready to start, and some of the ships hadbeen waiting since the beginning of the month, but the portuguese government were not satisfied with the Admiralty arrangements forescort, and would not allow them to sail.The First Sea Lord explained the impossibility of providingdestroyer escorts of sufficient strength for the whole voyage, asstipulated by the Portuguese Government, without jeopardising thesecurity of the Grand Fleet, and gave details of the- arrangements proposed by the Admiralty, which are explained in Foreign office telegram JMo. 25, dated the 14th January, 1917 (Appendix I;.Having regard to the fact that the Admiralty are providingprecisely similar arrangements for the security of the Portuguesetransports as they provide for their own, the War Cabinet decidedthat: The First Sea Lord and the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff should arrange with the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs for a personal interview with thePortuguese Minister in London, and impress on him theimportance of accepting the proposed arrangements.Cross-ChannelTransport of.Polling-stock.Attended forSubjects 7 and 8 :Sir A. Stanley,President of theBoard of Trade.7. With reference to the discussion on this subject at theprevious Meeting (War Cabinet 36, Minute 9), the President of theBoard of Trade reported that he had conferred with the interdepartmental Committee on Restriction of Imports. It wouldtake about forty ships to convey the railway stock, and the admiralty would take the necessary steps to get this tonnage. the interdepartmental Committee will be submitting proposals to lord curzon&apos;s Committee at an early date, and it is understood that thetotal restriction of imports will release a much larger amount ofshipping than the space required for the railway material.The War Cabinet invited the President of the Board of Tradeto take note that the transport of the great accumulation of ammu-nition is just as important as that of the railway material, and provision for this must also be made.-government control of Coalfields.8. The War Cabinet ruled that the decision that, the Govern-ment should take over the coalfields should apply to the whole ofthe British and Irish coalfields ; that the organisation should be ina separate department under the control of the Board of Trade ; and
that the head of the new organisation should be directly responsible to the President.The forthcoming conference inEussia.Military Aspects.Guns andAeroplanes9, The War Cabinet attached great importance to the develop-ment of Russia&apos;s offensive capacities in order to use up Germany&apos;reserves, and thus help the operations on the Western Front or even to break down the German resistance on the Eastern Front. lord milner was authorised to assume the existing promise of guns toRussia as a minimum. If, after the most searching enquiry, he andhis expert advisers come to the conclusion that Russia could make effective use of a greater quantity, it was arranged that he should&apos;report fully by telegraph to the War Cabinet. In forming his proposal for the decision of the War Cabinet, he should be guidednot only by technical considerations but also by those of a generalstrategical and political character.10. Lord Milner Was especially invited to enquire into thepossibility of sending British guns Avith their gunners, and receivingin exchange divisions of Russian infantry, who could be incorporatedinto our army organisation on the Western Front.11. The same principles should govern the assistance we should furnish in respect of aeroplanes.12. The Secretary was instructed to make enquiries about thepossibility of transporting and equipping any infantry which theRussians might be willing to send, and to inform Lord Milner. .Railways.13. The War Cabinet particularly drew Lord Milner&apos;s attentionto Minute 8 at the meeting held on the 9th January (War Cabinet 30,Minute 8), with reference to the possible appointment of a Britishrailway expert to assist the Russians.Political Aspects.Attended forSubjects 14 and 15 :Mr.    A.    Balfour,Secretary     ofState for ForeignAffairs.14. The War Cabinet discussed with the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs the political aspect of the mission. Lord Milnerwas authorised to use full discretion in taking advantage of any opportunity that might present itself to speak very plainly to theEmperor in regard to the danger threatened to the Allied cause bythe internal situation in Russia,Poland.15. The difficulty arising from the unwillingness of the Poles,on the one side, to rely upon any purely Russian guarantee of their future autonomous status, and of the Emperor, on the other, toallow the status of even an enlarged Poland to be treated asotherwise than a domestic Russian concern, was discussed.Lord Milner was authorised to exercise his discretion as tothe extent to which he might be able to urge upon the Russianauthorities the importance oi: conciliating Polish opinion, from thepoint of view both of Germany&apos;s efforts to organise a Polish army,and of the influence of the large Polish element in the UnitedStates.

Paraphrase of a telegram from Foreign Office to Sir L. Carnegie, Lisbon,at 11%50 a.m., January 14, 1917.WITH reference to your telegram No. 15 of the 11th January, the question of sending destroyers to escort the transports conveying the Portuguese Division hasalready been carefully considered by the British Admiralty. If they considered thatthereby additional safety would be guaranteed, they would be very willing to under-take such convoy, but they are of opinion that there would be great risk. On accountof the limited fuel supply of the destroyers, the transports and their proposed escortwould have to take an almost direct route, and thus the former would have to pass through a very dangerous zone. Moreover, the destroyers might not be able to keep up with the transports on account of heavy weather, which may be expected at this time of the year.Most careful consideration has been given re the orders which have been sent forthe transports, and they should be well clear by day-break if they leave at night-fall.As each ship is armed she can drive off an attack by gun fire. The destroyer escort,such as is proposed, could not prevent torpedo attack, but, as the ships would betogether, the escort would tend to increase the danger, as the transports could be firedat from a distance with reasonable chance of success. A good look out, quick use ofthe helm, and steering a zig -zag course are the best means to avoid an attack. Thiswill be done.The Admiralty feel sure that the Portuguese Government will, under thecircumstances, realise that the best and safest course to adopt is for the ships to sailas proposed, and for the arrangements for tire destroyers to join the ships later in the voyage to hold good.APPENDIX   ILMemorandum by the Financial Secretary to the War Office.1. TO exclude from the flat rate increase the wife with one child would add about350,000 to the number of cases to be investigated by the Statutory Committee, with considerable consequent delay. (The War Office hopes to begin payments at the new rates within a week of the iinal confirmation of the scale, and to finish by the endof the second week.)2. It is understood that the draft scale contemplated by the Statutory Committeewould allow payments up to 5s. a week for a wife with no child, and 0s. iid. for a wifewith one child. The War Office flat rate increase is nothing for the wife with nochild, and 2s. for the wife with one child. Allowing for the fact that&apos;the StatutoryCommittee figures are maxima, it is not clear that the War Office scale would in theresult cost more.3. The War Office, before putting forward its scale, discussed the question with persons of great practical, experience in the matter ; in particular, the Secretary of the manchester Social Workers&apos; Organisation (Guild of Help). The exclusion of thechildless .wife from increase was entirely approved ; but great stress was laid on thenecessity for giving the mother with one child sufficient to relieve her of the necessityfor working. It is feared that even if no increase is made, many mothers will endeavour to carry on with the present allowances, to the injury of their young children.It is held that there is no danger of the moderate increases proposed operating towithdraw any female labour from the market.4. I should anticipate considerable pressure in Parliament if the woman with one child is excluded as well as the woman with none, and some difficulty in successfullydefending the point.o
