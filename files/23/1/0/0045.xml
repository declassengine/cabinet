Food Supplies. Egypt and the Soudan.Note by the Foreign Office.Minute I.Air. L. Oliphant,THE Prime Minister has been enquiring whether any steps have been or arebeing taken to accumulate supplies of wheat and other foodstuffs in Egypt.The D.M.I., War Office, has no information on the subject. Has the ForeignOffice, please ?(Signed) L. STORE.January 22, 1917.Minute II.Major Storr,The question of accumulating stocks of wheat and foodstuffs in Egypt has notbeen raised, but the Foreign Office telegraphed to Cairo and Khartoum early inDecember last to instruct Sir H. McMahon and Sir R. Wingate to make thoroughenquiries into the possibility of increasing the area sown with wheat and other food-stuffs in Egypt and the Soudan respectively.The reply received from Cairo was to the effect that the winter crops were alreadyplanted, and it was impossible to change them, though the area sown with millet and maize might perhaps be increased in Upper Egypt ; and Sir H. McMahon also pointedout that Egypt did not normally sow enough wheat for her own consumption. At the instance of the Board of Agriculture, we have since called the attention of theEgyptian Government to the importance of increasing the production of durra as muchas possible.The enquiries as regards the Soudan are not yet complete, but it is hoped that thearea planted with wheat, can be increased by about 10,000 acres this season, and muchmore can be sown next season if means for extra artificial irrigation can be provided.This question is being carefully considered.(Initialled) D.January 22, 1917.APPENDIX II.Sugar.Note by the Food Controller.On the basis of 12 oz. per head per week, tonnage require-ments would be     ... ... ... ... ... 1,209,900On the basis of 8 oz. per head per week, tonnage require-ments would be    ... ... ... ... ...      960,317From July to December 1916 distribution was at annual rate of    ... ... ... ... ... ... 1,389,640 tons.During 12 weeks October 30, 1916, to January 20, 1917, atannual rate of       ... ... ... ... ... 1,268,621     ,,During 3 weeks January 1 to January 20, 1917, at annual rate of    ... ... ... ... ... ... 1,179,739The figures suggest that consumption is being steadily reduced, and during thepast three weeks has been lower than that estimated on the basis of a 12-oz. ration.
