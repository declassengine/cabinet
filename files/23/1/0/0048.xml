THE First Sea Lord and the Chief of the Imperial Generalregarding the sink-   Staff reported that they had no knowledge of the sinking of a troop-ing of a Transport.    ship, as reported in the German wireless news to have taken placeon the 9th January, 1917.Future Military 2. The War Cabinet laid stress on the preparation of timelyOperations. and adequate plans to meet the possible failure of the great offensive... by the Allies in the spring of 1917, in the West, to achieve decisiveresults. .   They consider such preparations to be important, to[1365- 48] , B
provide against any reaction of public opinion in tbe Allied countries.Several possible alternative theatres of operations were discussed.3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff, at the request ofthe Prime Minister, undertook to report to the War Cabinet as tothe preparations that were being made for operations from Egyptagainst Turkey as soon as local climatic conditions render themfeasible.5. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that theBritish losses at Kut during the attack on the 2oth instantamounted to only about 1,000, whereas we had buried 950 Turks,whose losses might be assumed to be very much greater.5. The War Cabinet took note of the arrangements made by thePrime Minister with the Representatives of the Italian Governmenton the 2Rth January, 1917, for the provision of coal to Italy(Appendix 1).6. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that hehad received information indicating that the Germans weremanufacturing large quantities of shells containing cyanide ofpotassium.The War Cabinet took note of the decision of the late war committee (War Committee, Paper 57, Conclusion 3), that shellscontaining Jellite should be manufactured and despatched for theuse of the Expeditionary Force in France.The Secretary was instructed to ascertain from the Ministry ofMunitions exactly what the present position was as regards themanufacture and supply of shells containing cyanide of potassiumand similar constituents.7. The War Cabinet approved a proposal of the First Sea Lordthat the Admiralty should waive their objection to the despatch ofpart of the Portuguese contingent, destined for the Western front,under a Portuguese naval escort, as a British naval escort was not immediately available, on the understanding that all responsibilityrested with the Portuguese Government.8. The First Sea Lord stated that he had received information from the British naval Attache at Christiania of the press reports ofthe sinking of a German submarine by a British auxiliary cruiser,but that no report had yet been received from the commander ofthe cruiser.9. The First Sea Lord reported the loss of a British submarineof the latest type during her trials. He trusted that it might bepossible eventually to raise the submarine, but he could not noldout much hope as regards the crew.10. In continuation of the discussion on this question, adjournedfrom the 25th January, the War Cabinet had under consideration the following documents : (a.) Note by the Secretary of State for India, dated the 25th.January, 1917 (Appendix II).
(o.) Paraphrase of Foreign Office telegram to. Sir C. Greene,His MajestyV Ambassador, Tokyo, No. 47, dated the23rd January, 1917 (Appendix III),(c.) Paraphrase of telegram from Sir C. Greene to ForeignOffice, No. 54, dated the 26th January, 1917 (Appendix-IV). &apos;(d.) Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the effect inLancashire of the proposed duty on cotton imported intoIndia (Appendix V).Having regard to the tenor of these reports and the verbalconfirmation afforded to them during the discussion, the WarCabinet decided : (1.) To authorise the raising of the import duty on cottons to7-g- per cent.(2.) To leave the excise duty unchanged for the present.The War Cabinet laid stress on the importance of the develop-ment of India&apos;s supplies, not only for the support of the mother country, but also of Egypt.The Secretary of State for India reviewed the position, andcalled attention to the difficulties he was experiencing in obtaining the necessary machinery and material for increasing India&apos;s pro-ductioo, and in obtaining transport for rice which was available in burma for export. As regards additional men for military service,he was in communication with the Government of India, and hadtransmitted to them suggestions received from the War Office: The Secretary of State for India undertook&apos;to consider a proposal that a special Mission should be sent to India to stimulateIndia&apos;s contribution to the War.Position ofMilitary Membersof Parliament.11. The War Cabinet had before them a copy of a letter from lord Winterton to the Prime Minister, dated the 21st December,1916 (Appendix VI), regarding the position of Members of Parliamentserving with the Expeditionary Forces.The War Cabinet conferred with the Speaker of the House ofCommons on the subject of the position of Members of Parliamentwho were also performing military service, whose numbers are statedto be about 170, of whom some 80 members are estimated to beserving abroad. The Speaker stated that, if an Order were issuedsummoning the Members to Parliament, in his opinion they wouldhave to resume their parliamentary duties, with or without leavefrom the military authorities ; but, in the absence of such an Order,their military would have to take precedence of their parliamentary duties.The War Cabinet decided : To maintain the present arrangement, viz., that, in the ordinary course, Members should elect which form of service theywould undertake ; but that, in the event of an urgentparliamentary question arising, those Members performing-naval or military service would have the right to return to-Parliament.Alien Princes&quot; Deprivation ofTitles &quot; Bill.12. The War Cabinet continued the discussion of this questioninitiated on the 23rd December, 191(5 (War Cabinet 16, Minute 1),.and had before them particulars of the various parliamentarypledges on the subject (War Cabinet, Paper G-117).It was generally agreed that the matter has no real and intrinsicimportance, but, having regard to the strong feeling on the subjectof aliens generally in the House of Commons, which has alreadyfound expression in drastic provision against aliens of low degree,,the War Cabinet were of opinion that some action must be taken.
It was decided that : The Home Secretary should re-draft the Bill in such form as totake away from alien enendes and persons who have bornearms against us in the present war all titles and privileges and vested rights, the removal of which requires Parlia-mentary sanction, including more particularly the right to sit in Parliament, and the right of succession to the Thronej13. The Fourth Sea Lord, who was supported on military grounds by Sir Guy Granet, reported that it was imperative and essential, for the punctual discharge of British ships at Salonica, toobtain the use of certain sheds on the British Quay at Salonicawhich are at present occupied by the Greeks for Customs and commercial purposes. General Milne reported that the GreekProvisional Government had agreed to the utilisation by the british forces of these sheds, but that General Sarrail had hitherto been unwilling to sanction this arrangement.The War Cabinet decided that : The Foreign Office should make representations to the FrenchGovernment to the pffect that the War Cabinet hadcarefully examined this question, and attached greatimportance to the allocation of these sheds for the use ofthe British Forces at Salonica.The Fourth Sea Lord was instructed to draft a telegram forthe Foreign Office to send to the French Government.-German Prisoners 14. The Adjutant-General read to the War Cabinet the para-of War employed phrase of a telegram, dated the 25th instant, which had been received in the Western that morning from the American Ambassador at Berlin, stating thatZone of Operations. the German Foreign Office were informed that the British Expedi-tionary Force were employing, near the immediate front in France,large numbers of German prisoners, who were reported lo be badlyfed and lodged, and that these men were suffering on account of the severity of the work, and from various other disabilities. It m&apos;as also stated that deaihs and wounds had resulted from exposureto German fire and battle risks. The German Government contended that no British prisoners, except sick and wounded and thoseassisting in lazarets, were detained in France or Belgium, and theydemanded the removal of all German prisoners to a point 30kilom. from the firing line, where they should receive suitabletreatment. The German Government added that should asatisfactory reply not be received by the 1st February, to the effectthat the above-mentioned demands would be fulfilled by the BritishGovernment, a number of British prisoners would be removed to the zone of war in the West, from Germany, and subjected to the same treatment as that meted out to German prisoners by the british military authorities. &apos; It was further stated that all prisoners takenin future would, until further notice, be retained in the zone of operations under similar conditions.The Adjutant-General stated that he had made enquiries of theField-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief, British Expeditionary Force,and that he had been informed by him that out of 58 prisoners-of-war companies 40 were hutted, and the remainder were temporarily in tents provided with flooi boards and stoves, that,all prisoners were--!, supplied with two blankets, one water-proof sheet, great-coat, andcardigan jacket, and that they received the same issue of warmunder-clothing as our own men, that only one prisoner had been:,. ;  ; wounded by German gunfire, and that the nearest possible positionSalonica:Port Facilities.
of an enemy gun was about 12,300 yards. The War cabinet decided: .,, (1.) That, in the first instance, the Adjutant-General should ascertain what the French practice was in thisconnection ;(2.) That the Adjutant-General should enquire as to what extent the withdrawal of enemy prisoner labour parties to aminimum distance of 10 miles from the British frontlines would be detrimental to works of militaryconstruction in France.(Initialled)      D.

Coal for Italy.Note of the Conference held at 1.0, Downing Street on January 26, 1917, between thePrime Minister and Representatives of the Italian Government.; THE Prime Minister, accompanied by the Shipping Controller, saw the italian ambassador, Admiral Corsi, Italian Minister of Marine ; General Dallolio, italian minister of Munitions ; Signor Ancona, Under-Secretary, Italian Ministry of Transport;and Professor Attolico, Commission Internationale de Ravitaillement, this evening, tofurther discuss the Italian requirements of tonnage.The Prime Minister assured the Italian Ministers that the British Governmentwere most anxious to assist Italy to obtain additional tonnage for coal, of which shewas in so great need, but, unfortunately, there was very little British tonnage available.He understood that the Italian Government could themselves furnish 500,000 tons per month out of the 800,000 tons which was required, leaving a balance of 300,000 tons to be provided for ; the British Government would do their best to help in making up this balance. He hoped that a portion would be supplied by neutral vessels. Undera recent allocation of neutral tonnage by the newly-established Inter-Ally CharteringCommittee, France had been given half of the neutral tonnage available, and the otherbalf had gone to Italy, England having renounced her share in favour of the ItalianGovernment.He was of the opinion that France was getting more than her share ; in fact,her tonnage position at the present moment is better than British, and in thesecircumstances he was going to propose to the French Government that they should give up 100,000 tons of the British tonnage at present in her employ. He had approached the Admiralty, and had asked them to find 125,000 tons during next month,but he drew the attention of the Italian Ministers to the fact that in so doing we were running grave risks, since not only this country, but also France and Italy, were dependent on the British Fleet for the mastery of the seas.He felt confident, therefore, that it would be possible to make up the balance of300,000 tons for February as follows : Tons.From the British Admiralty .. . ... ..       125,000To be withdrawn from French service        .. .... ..       100,000Neutral tonnage .. .. ,. .. . . ., 75,000300,000The Prime Minister referred to the question of sending&apos; coal by rail across france to Italy, and although it might only be possible to send a very small quantity, yet itwould relieve the situation, it was agreed that this question should be carefully considered with a view to seeing what could be done.General Dallolio asked whether it would be possible to supply an additional quantity of coal this month. It was explained to him by the Prime Minister that thiswould be quite impossible. Signor Ancona said that in these circumstances he wouldbe obliged to ask the Minister of Marine to let him have 100,000 tons immediately fromthe naval reserve. Mr. Lloyd George pointed out in reply that the British Governmenthad already been obliged to take this step and draw upon the Admiralty StrategicalDeserve in order to supply Italy with additional coal, and that, owing to this action, theAdmiralty were short of their requirements last month by 70,000 tons.Signor Ancona asked whether any information was forthcoming with regard tothe amount of British tonnage that would be allocated to Italy for the carriage ofwheat, and was informed in reply that this matter would be discussed with the WheatExecutive and Admiralty officials concerned.The Italian Ambassador, in thanking the Prime Minister for the assistance whichbe had promised to the Italian Government, stated that the Italian Ministers were alsomost grateful for the way in which their request had been met.
India&apos;s Financial Contribution to the War., .;1.1 CIRCULATE for the information of the War Cabinet a Minute (Appendix A)from a Committee of the whole Council on the proposals of the Government of india for raising revenue sufficient to enable a contribution of 100,000,OOOZ. to be made by india to the cost of the war.2. I desire to press most strongly for the assent of the Cabinet to the raising of theimport duty on cotton to 7^ per cent. I regard this proposal as a sine qua non of theoffer of the Government of India, without which their proposal will not be practicableeither financially or politically.3. I should be very glad if the Cabinet could at the same time authorise anannouncement that when money is available the existing excise duty of 3-g- per cent,may be abolished. On this point I attach an extract from a note circulated by me.tothe late Cabinet in January 1916 (Appendix B). There is, as 1 there stated, no question on which all opinion in India is so united, and there is no single announcement whichwould do more to unite Indian opinion in support of the proposed Imperial contribu-tion. But 1 recognise the difficulties, and if the Cabinet feels that, constituted as that body is, it cannot pledge the future, I shall, though with great reluctance, urge Counciland the Government of India to waive this condition.4. I agree with the Committee of Council that the question of a future generalenhancement of the rate of customs duties may be left to be decided if and when thefinancial necessity arises.5. It is right that I should call attention to the fact that the offer of the Govern-ment of India is and must be * subject to the condition that India &quot; does not have tomeet, as a consequence of the European war, a conflagration on the North-west frontier, which -would involve us in a very heavy expenditure, and pro tanto reduce our ability to render direct assistance His Majesty&apos;s Government.&quot;6. The Viceroy also asks me to impress upon the Cabinet that while they have not made any conditions as regards a naval contribution, they are offering all that inpresent circumstances they can safely ask India to give ; that one of the main reasonsby which they can justify their proposal is the protection afforded to the trade andcoasts of India by His Majesty&apos;s Navy.AC.January 25, 1917.Appendix A.Minute of a Committee of the Whole Council.The majority of the Committee of the whole Council recommend : 1. That the Government of India be allowed to increase the cotton import duty &apos;in 1917-18 without an accompanying increase in the cotton excise duty, as proposedby them.2. That, if the proposal in 1 is not accepted by the War Cabinet, the question ofthe amount of the War Contribution should be regarded as one to be reconsidered inconsultation with the Government of. India.3. That permission be granted to the Government of India to announce theintention to remit the cotton excise duty when financial conditions permit.4. The Committee understand that the Government of India do not. ask permission to make any announcement regarding an increase of the general customs tariff toprovide new revenue hereafter. They doubt the value of any permission that could now be given by the Secretary of State to the Government of India to raise futurerevenue by an enhancement of the general customs duties. The uncertainty regardingthe future fiscal relations of the various parts of the Empire is the chief difficulty which would prevent any such permission from having an appreciable value.5. Provided the proposals in (1) above are accepted, the Committee recommendthat, a War Contribution of 100,000,000^. be offered to the Home Government on behalf
of India ; the contribution to take the form partly of the transfer to the Home Govern-ment of the proceeds of the rupee loan to be issued in 1917, partly of the transfer ofthe proceeds of any Indian loan that may be issued in America, and (as regards theremainder) of the assumption by India of liability for British War Loan. The offer should be accompanied by a statement that the contribution may have to be less thanthe amount now proposed if, as an incident or consequence of the present war, theGovernment of India is involved in heavy expenditure for military operations on or near the frontiers of India.6. In the above recommendations recorded in accordance with the Secretary ofState&apos;s wishes, for submission, if he so desires, to the War Cabinet, the Committee havemade no reference to the proposals in paragraph 7 of the telegram from Governmentof India, dated the 6th January, because these matters do not seem to need CabinetConsideration.Note by Mr. Currie, dated January 24, 1917.; 1 differ from the majority of the Committee on the question of authorising theGovernment of India to announce that they propose to abolish the existing cottonexcise duty at the earliest favourable opportunity. 1 think it would be unwise to givea &quot;pledge to forego what will probably be an increasing source of revenue for the sake6f obtaining popularity.r:; I regret that&apos;the question of India&apos;s contribution should have been brought forward before the end of the war; but, as the 100,000,0001. proposal has been made,I recognise that it would be hardly possible to resist the raising of the existing cottonduties to 7ij- per cent., notwithstanding the controversy that such a measure,^unaccompanied by a corresponding excise duty, is certain to arouse.Appendix B.- Extract from a Note circulated to Cabinet in January 1916.th    The point on which I require a decision from the Cabinet is as follows :  Whilst raising the customs duty on imported cotton manufactures from 3i percent, to 5 per. cent., the Government of India propose to leave the excise duty at itspresent figure of 3-g- per cent.The Cabinet will remember the acute controversies which raged around thereimposition of the cotton duties by Sir Henry Fowler in 1894, and I can well believethat they may be unwilling to confront a renewal of the same agitation in Lancashireat the present time. On the other hand, any attempt to raise the excise dutj^ will bebitterly resented in India. There is no question on which Indian opinion is sounanimous, and in so speaking I include Anglo-Indian as well as native-indian opinion. I attach to this note an extract from a memorandum sent privately to me bythe Viceroy (Lord Hardinge), together with the comments of the members of his council and other distinguished officials, to whom he referred the memorandum forcriticism. It will be seen that they are not merely opposed to any increase in theexcise duty, but that they are unanimous in asking that the excise duty should betotally abolished.In forwarding the Budget proposals to me the Government of India telegraphed : &quot;We put revision of tariff in forefront as cardinal feature of any largei    scheme of taxation, and proposals regarding income tax and salt duty elaboratedbelow are supplementary.   We believe that our scheme as a whole, if the tariffproposals stand, will command that general measure of acquiescence which inpresent political conditions is essential.   We should indeed have much liked toamplify tariff portion of our taxation scheme by associating with it remission ofexisting excise duty on cotton.   Financial condition, however, makes it obviouslyunsuitable to remit existing taxation at this moment.    We urge most strongly,:; however, that we be authorised to give undertaking that excise duty will be,:: abolished as soon as financial circumstances permit.    We attach very greatv i i   political importance to such announcement.   Feeling in India against excise is constantly growing in strength and the announcement of its future abolitionwould be regarded as a real earnest of goodwill and appreciation by His Majesty&apos;s,a; Government and&apos; as removal of what is universally regarded as a grave injustice.&quot;
,  In a private telegram dated the 5th January Lord Hardinge adds : &quot;You are aware of strength of feeling in favour of an industrial policy for India. I am convinced that Indians will never believe in sincerity of BritishGovernment in this matter until pledge is given for withdrawal of excise duty on cotton piece-goods. Demand voiced in recent Gongress meetings at Bombay forautonomy in fiscal questions is largely based on argument that British Govern-memVs fiscal policy in India is dictated by British manufacturers, and anomaly ofexcise duty is invariably cited in support of this contention, since, in the case ofother manufacturers, there is no countervailing excise. I would very stronglyurge Cabinet should weigh our proposals in this connection most carefully andsympathetically, and that in any case they should not reject or modify them without confidential negotiations with Manchester Chamber of Commerce,especially on the point whether there is really serious competition betweenproducts of our mills and Lancashire piece-goods. This is manifestly an oppor-tunity when Manchester can be pressed on patriotic and Imperial grounds toendeavour to meet Indian opinion.&quot;I have written to the Viceroy privately that I cannot expect the Cabinet toauthorise me to give any pledge as to the future total abolition of the excise. I do,however, earnestly hope that, having regard to the anxieties of the position in Indiaand to the very strong Indian opinion upon this question, the Cabinet will allow theGovernment of India to leave the excise duty untouched at its present figure whileraising the customs duty as proposed. In some ways we are in a strong position to do this, inasmuch as no party in Lancashire could make party capital out of our action.But I have to admit that I have always felt that our position in regard to these dutieswas a very weak one, and that it appeared to me to be the only point in which it couldbe shown that British policy in India was determined neither by consideration for indian feeling nor by Indian interests, but by the supposed interests of our own trade.A. C.January 17, 191b.APPENDIX III.Paraphrase of Telegram No. 47, dated the 2ord January, 1917, from Foreign Officeto Sir C. Greene, Tokio.THE Government of India are contemplating thS imposition of additional importduties on cotton with a view to raising revenue and making a substantial contributionto the expenses of the war.It is anticipated that, if the duties are raised to 1\ per cent., the general tariffstandard, the yield would be 1,000,OOOZ. Should His Majesty&apos;s Government accede tothis proposal, and also permit remission of cotton excise when financial conditions arefavourable, it would greatly facilitate acceptance of new taxation, be politicallybeneficial, and produce a large contribution towards the expenses of the war.Cotton imports into India from Japan for 1913-1914 were only 1-g- per cent. Nodifferentiation against Japan is contemplated, nor would Japan have any locus standiin objecting; there could&apos;be no justification for Japan taking up the position ofdictating; what should be the fiscal policy of India.Nevertheless, we must take account of any possible resentment which may be caused by the raising of the duty such as would affect Japan&apos;s participation in the war,at a time when we and the Russians are asking material assistance from her.You are therefore asked to consider the probable effect of the proposal in Japan,and to telegraph your own views. The Japanese Government should not be approached. Provision for the change will not be published in India until March,when it will be included in the Budget. No immediate announcement is contemplated.
Paraphrase of a Telegram from Sir G. Greene, Tokyo, No. 54, dated January 26, 1917.IT is not likely that resentment would be caused here by your proposal to increaseimport duty. The Japanese are familiar with tariffs, and themselves have a tariff ofabout 20 per cent on cotton goods. There has been some anticipation of such ameasure among exporters in Japan, but so long as Japan and the United kingdom are not differentiated, opposition is unlikely, in 1916 cotton tissues exported to Indiasurpassed twice those of 1915 by 1,000,OOOL, but even this is only about a sixth of thecotton piece-goods exported from Japan.The financial arrangements of the Japanese cotton merchants are nrach upset atthe moment by the Council [sic: ?Importer] Bill. Once this is out of the way, theproposed increase of import duties would not, 1 imagine, cause trouble, provided Ishall be in a position to announce here, simultaneously with the announcement inIndia, that Japan and the United Kingdom will be treated identically.The effect of the charge on cotton hosiery, largely exported to India, should beconsidered.APPENDIX V.Effect of Increased Import Duty in India on Cotton.Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.I HAVE made enquiries, so far as I am able, as to the effect of increasing thecotton duties in India without a corresponding increase in the excise.In addition to consulting a small number of those engaged in the cotton trade of lancashire, I have discussed the subject with Mr. Hodge, who is the member forGorton.The opinion of all those whom I have consulted is to the same effect. It is thatthe proposal will receive a certain amount of opposition, but that if it justified as awar measure to enable India to give increased help in carrying on the war, theopposition is not likely to be serious.(Initialled)      A. B. L.January 27, 1917. *APPENDIX VI.Position of Members of Parliament Serving with Expeditionary Forces.Copy of Letter from Lord Winterton to the Prime Minister, dated the21st December, 1916.Dear Mr. Lloyd George, ,I MUST ask you to accept my apology for writing to you personally at a time,when you must be very busy, and for writing in pencil, which the circumstances inwhich 1 am necessitate.Though I am speaking only for myself, I believe I voice the opinion of a good many Members of Parliament serving in this Force, when I say that we feel we mayin the near or distant future be faced by the problem of deciding whether we oughtto remain out here, or. apply for leave home to attend to our Parliamentary duties. Iunderstand that the constitutional position of Members serving abroad is that leave to attend to Parliamentary duties is granted at the discretion of the Commander-in-Chief of the Force in which the Member is serving, but each Member has a right (or at any rate it has been laid down that he will be given the option) of being secondedor put in the reserve, with of course no guarantee of being taken again on the active list.
While it would be improper on my part to suggest, nor do I think it likely thatthe&apos; Commander-in-Chief of this force would refuse leave, it is clear that it is a verydelicate and invidious matter for a Member to ask for leave (except in a grave crisis)from this country to attend to Parliamentary duties, especially when it might meanblocking the chances of a brother officer who might urgently require leave for other reasons. Again, no one of us out here, or for that matter anywhere, who is both anM.P. and a soldier, likes to give up his military duties which seconding would involve.I speak feelingly, being in command of a camel corps company, and having had, andhaving, a lot of very interesting work and fighting to do. But I would rather lose myjob here, and risk the inevitable retort that I prefer voting to fighting, than feel that,as a humble supporter of your Government, you needed my vote and I should beat home.So I venture to ask you if you could, through your Secretary, instruct me as to thecourse that you wish me and others out&quot; here to pursue if which I hope they may not circumstances arise in which you require every vote of your supporters.May I add that a public utterance of yours on the subject, and a declaration as toour duty, would greatly ease the difficulties to which I have referred.I am, &amp;c.(Signed) WINTERTOK
