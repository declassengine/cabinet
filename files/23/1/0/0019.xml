THE War Cabinet discussed the proposals made by theFrench representatives at the Conference on the previous afternoonfor a considerable extension of the British line on the western front.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff read a letter he had just received on the subject from General Sir Douglas Haig, fromwhich it appeared that he had already agreed to take over nearly half of the line proposed by General jSTivelle. Before giving adefinite reply in regard to the remainder of the line, he wished toknow what other troops he might expect to receive from Englandand elsewhere during the next two or three months.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that two divisions would be&apos; ready to proceed abroad from this country inJanuary and probably two more divisions in February. He addedthat there was no disagreement between General Sir Douglas haig and General Nivelle in principle provided there is no diminution ofthe British force in France.The War Cabinet decided to reply to the French representatives that they were in general, sympathy with the french proposal that we should take over more line, but that wecould not commit ourselves in detail until we had had anopportunity to go into the matter with General Sir douglas haig.
The Balkans: The 2. The War Cabinet  had - under consideration the french military Policy.       proposal that two additional British divisions should be sent to salonica.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff made a statement onthe subject, which is printed in the Appendix.No final decisions were taken pending the Conference with therepresentatives of the French Government, to follow immediatelyafter this Meeting, but the general trend of the views expressed was. in the following direction : (i.) That the Allies should hold Monastir and the line atpresent occupied as long as possible, but that a second and, shorter defensive, line must be made ready for occupation in case of emergency,(ii.) That British drafts and heavy artillery should be expeditedin accordance with the decision already taken by theWar Cabinet.(hi.) That the British Government should render any assistancein their power in expediting the transport of the two additional divisions which the French Government havedecided to send out, and which, under existing arrange-ments, cannot arrive before the middle of February. Itwas indicated that this might be effected by diverting,to temporary service in the Mediterranean, some seventransports about to proceed to Australia to bring backAustralian drafts.^(iv.) That further pressure should, if possible, be put on theItalian Government to send some additional divisions,not to Valona, but to Salonica.Having regard to the shipping difficulties, and the delays which already exist in the despatch of drafts to Salonica, the view was generally held that additional British divisions should not be sent,but no final decision was taken.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff undertook to consultGeneral Milne as to the desirability of supplying him with additionalheavy guns.(Initialled)      D. LI. G.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,December 27, 1916.* Note by the First Sea Lord of the. Admiralty. As regards (hi) it is pointed out that the transports inquestion will not he available for French use until probably tbe end of January as they are included in those required for (ii). By the end of January possibly they will be of no use to the French. It is also pointedout that these transports bring back meat from Australia as well as troops.
(Secret.) &apos;WHEN the two French divisions arranged for at the Boulogne Conference and.the necessary French drafts have arrived at Salonica there will be about 480,000 allied troops as against 300,000 of the enemy. There will then he twenty-one and a halfAllied-divisions, and two more French divisions are due to arrive by the middle ofFebruary. The six - Serbian divisions are now about two-thirds the strength of theFrench divisions, and therefore there will be by the middle of February the equivalent of twenty-one and a half complete divisions.Colonel Billotte, who represents General Joffre, explained to me last night thattheir estimate of the total number of divisions which the enemy might bring againstMacedonia is thirty-three as compared with our estimate of thirty-five or thirty-six.General Milne has estimated that to hold the present line twenty-nine divisionswill be necessary, and that to hold a more retired line stretching from Veria byOstrovo and then along the present front would require twenty-two divisions.The French think that Sarrail might be able to hold the present line with twenty-one and a half divisions, but they have left him liberty of action, in the event of heavy attack, to hold such position as he deems best. But if the Greeks become hostile theyconsider that more divisions would be needed. They admit that the threatened attackon Macedonia about which so much has been heard may be German bluff, but in orderto meet the possibility of a hostile Greece they wish us to send two more divisions now,and if Greece does not prove to be hostile these divisions could return to France. Thiswould mean placing two divisions out of action for a period of at least five months and making two changes in the kind of land transport they need. I understand form colonel Billotte that General Cadorna has replied that he does not agree with theproposal to send any more Italians divisions. The French lay great stress on holdingMonastir if possible, as they think that its evacuation would mean the disaffection -ofthe Serbians and the fall of the French Ministry.As regards Greece, she now seems to be doing all we wish, and the chance of herbecoming hostile is less than it was. In any case, 1 do not think it ought to bepossible for a German force of any strength to move down into Greece with an allied force of twenty-one and a half divisions on its eastern flank. On the other hand, I certainly cannot guarantee that German troops will not enter Greece, because I haveno confidence in Sarrail, nor is it possible to guarantee anything in war. the quartermaster-General and I think that even if we sent more divisions they could notbe properly maintained. Our troops abroad are now suffering from being ill-equipped with drafts. Further, I do not think that if more divisions were sent and could besupplied that they would arrive in time to take part in warding off a German attack,because we could not hope to get them there and equip them with fresh transportbefore March.In my opinion, no more divisions should be sent ; the risk of the Germans enteringGreece should be taken ; Monastir should be evacuated and the present line shortenedif and when a German attack is threatened ; the Salonica forces should now haveprimarily a defensive role.I recommend a defensive role, because at the present time our forces at Salonicaare in a very dangerous condition owing to the breakdown of shipping and to insecurelines of communication. The shipping difficulty and insecurity of the lines ofcommunication will in all probability become much greater in the future, and by sending more divisions we should greatly be increasing the chance of eventual disaster.Our general object now should be the security of the force.December 27, 1916.PBIHTBD AT IHB ffOBBIOM OFFICE BY G.
