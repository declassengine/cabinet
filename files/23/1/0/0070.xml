I*aPer- 2. With regard to Section I of the Interdepartmental Com-mittee&apos;s Report, the President of the Board of Trade reported thatthe restrictions on paper would cut down the paper for the newspapers considerably below the minimum amounts stipulated forby the deputation of newspaper proprietors to the Prime Minister.He pointed out the severe effects this would have on many other branches of trade : such as the book trade, tbe printing trade, andadvertising. He stated that the Chairman of the Paper commission had made a fresh proposal, the effect of which was that imports of white paper should be cut down to one-third of the imports of 1914,and mill-board to one-fifth of the 1914 figures, and that Govern-ment Departments should deal with their own requirements (the^ilc-nt. e^trmtrte of which had now been increased) through the PaperCommission.Sir Henry Babington-Smith pointed out that the differencebetween this proposal and that of the Interdepartmental Committeewas that the former would bear more heavily on the packing trades,and the latter on the printing and newspaper trades.Mr. Wintour laid stress on the importance of the moral effecton our Dominions and Allies of cutting down the newspapers.The drastic curtailments of their own exports to this country: would, he thought, be more acceptable if the British newspaperswere cut down.After hearing the views of each of the Ministers present, theWar Cabinet decided that The reduction should be divided equally between the packingand printing trades, unless it is found to bear inequitablyor to be unworkable. The President of the Board ofTrade and. Sir Henry Babington Smith undertook toexamine this in concert.*3. The War Cabinet approved the proposal in paragraph 17of the Report of the Interdepartmental Committee for the total prohibition of the importation of printed posters and other coatedpaper, as well as paper hangings, in addition to the importation offoreign printed matter, including books, newspapers, magazines,periodicals, &amp;c, except for single copies sent through the post,subject to the grant of licences in exceptional cases.They also approved the following recommendations : (a.) That further steps should be taken to enforce economy inthe consumption of paper, both by Government Depart-ments and by others.In this connection they decided that the secretary should particularly call the attention of Sir GeorgeToulmin, the Chairman of the Parliamentary Committeeon Publications, to No. 4 of the Interdepartmental Com-mittee&apos;s recommendations in paragraph 18, and that the* As a result of this consultation, it was decided that The total import of paper, paper-making1 materials, boards, &amp;c. includingGovernment requirements, should not exceed 640,000 tons in 1917, and that thereduction should be effected so that the total imports of white paper and paper-making materials in 1917 should not exceed one-third of their import in 1914.Kestrietion of lm- 1. THE War Cabinet approved the Report of Lord Curzon&apos;sports. Committee on the Restriction of Imports, dated tbe 14th February,covering and approving generally a detailed Report by Sir H.Babington Smith&apos;s Interdepartmental Committee (War cabinet paper G.-124), and recommending restrictions on tbe scale of500,000 tons per month, subject to the following observations.
Timber.    &apos; 4. Impressed with the importance of curtailing the imports of timber, the estimate for which amounts to no less than 200,000 tonsout of the proposed total restriction of 500,000 tons a month, theWar Cabinet, who also had before them a Memorandum by theFirst Commissioner of Works on this subject, dated the 26thJanuary, 1917, approved the proposals of the interdepartmental committee (including the issue of a Cabinet Instruction on economy in the ease-of Timber), and the following proposals on page (ii) ofthe Report of Lord Curzon&apos;s Committee, viz., that: (a.) A Director of Timber Supplies should be appointed inthe War Office.(b.) He should have an Interdepartmental Committee to assist them.(c.) The functions of the Home-Grown Timber Committee andother existing authorities should be absorbed in the newauthority.They approved the appointment of Sir J. Bampfylde Fuller as director of Timber Supplies, and authorised theSecretary of State for War to set up this new Depart-ment of the War Office without delay. aEaw Fruit. 5. The War Cabinet approved the proposals of Lord Curzon&apos;sReport in regard to raw fruit and vegetables that is to say, thatthe following should be cut down 75 per cent, (it being understoodthat this figure includes a margin of, say, 25 per cent, with which it-may be found necessary in some cases to bargain):  Oranges.Grapes.Bananas.Onions.Other reductions to be as recommended in the Report. jLuxuries. 6. With regard to the imports of canned salmon, the WarCabinet decided that This article of food should be allowed to be imported for theuse of the Canadian troops in excess of the amount to be licensed under the Committee&apos;s proposals. The Secretaryof State for the Colonies undertook to examine the matter.[1365-70] B 2Controller of the Stationery Office should be notified bythe Secretary, on behalf of the War Cabinet, to form aPriority List for printed Parliamentary Reports, with aview to a material postponement in the printing of bulkyand less important documents.(6.) That increased efforts should be made to organise thecollection of waste paper.With reference to this recommendation, the WarCabinet decided that the President of the LocalGovernment Board should be invited to draw up a circular addressed to the Local Authorities, and that theSecretary for Scotland and the Chief Secretary for ireland should also arrange for the issue of a circular to Local Authorities in Scotland and Ireland respectively to the same effect.
7. Sir Henry Babington Smith pointed out that, in order toreach the total figure of 500,000 tons per month to be restricted,some reduction in foods and feeding stuffs would be needed, andin particular that another reduction of brewing will be necessary.The last regulation caused a saving at the rate of 24,000 tons per month, and it was now proposed to make a further cut in order to save another 24,000 tons per month. The War Cabinet therefore decided that This proposal should be adopted, viz., a further reduction ofbrewing by 30 per cent, on the figure permitted under theOutput of Beer Restriction Act. The result of this wouldbe that, whereas before the war there were about35,000,000 standard barrels brewed in the year, now therewill be about 10,000,000 barrels.The Food Controller and the President of the Board ofAgriculture should consider in what way the imports of food and feeding stuffs can best be reduced, so as to bring the total savingup to 500,000 tons per month.Mineral Oils. 8. The War Cabinet instructed the Secretary to communicate with the Local Government Board, the Secretary for Scotland, andthe Chief Secretary for Ireland in order that they should consider in concert measures for securing the pooling by tradesmen, newspaper proprietors, newsagents, &amp;c, of delivery vans, either through the agency of the licensing authorities or otherwise.Brewing Materials.Foods and FeedingStuffs.Painters&apos; Colours 9. With regard to the Interdepartmental Committee&apos;s suggestion and Pigments. that tenants and landlords should be released during the War fromcovenants requiring them to proceed with internal and externalpainting of houses at specified intervals, &amp;c., the War Cabinet decidedthat The Home Secretaiy and the Secretary for Scotland should confer on this subject and report to the War Cabinet.Cinematograph 10. The War Cabinet decided &quot;1    &apos; Not to prohibit the importation of cinematograph films, as recommended in Section V of the interdepartmental committee&apos;s Report.Fixing Prices. 11. The question of controlling the price of food, in order toprevent speculation and the creation of monopolies in articles thatare arbitrarily reduced, referred to in the last paragraph of LordGurzon&apos;s Committee, was discussed by the War Cabinet, whodecided that The Food Controller should consider the whole question of fixing prices, as a consequence of the restriction.Publication. 12. The War Cabinet decided that The announcement of these restrictions should be made by thePrime Minister in the House of Commons at an early date,after communication with the Dominions and foreign,countries.
Imports in enemy ships now in neutral Ports.13. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs asked the WarCabinet whether, in the course of his negotiations with neutral governments, he might inform them that any articles brought tothis country in enemy ships at present in neutral ports would notbe liable to prohibition.The War Cabinet agreed to this request of the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs.Proclamation. 14. The War Cabinet authorised the President of the Boardof Trade to announce in the press that a Proclamation will shortly be made prohibiting the importation, except under licence, of alarge number of commodities. Further, that the Board of trade will reserve the right to refuse licences to goods of the prohibitedclasses unless they are shipped to or paid for by a consignee in theUnited Kingdom before the 17th February, 1917.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,February 17,. 1917.(Initialled)D.
