THE War Cabinet held a preliminary discussion on thesubject of the overtures made by the President of the United Statesof America in regard to peace.   (Appendix I.)TheWar Cabinet decided that., in the first instance, they required information as to what would be the effect on british and Allied interests if President Wilson were touse the maximum pressure on the Allies of which he wascapable in order to stop the war, and, secondly, whatwould be the effect in America of hostile trade and financial measures against the Entente Powers.The Secretary; who had already been in&apos; 6bmmunication with.the: Treasury, the,Miriistry of Munitions, the Board of Trade, and theBoard of Agriculture and Fisheries, in regard to this matter, was instructed to furnish a Memorandum oh the subject at the earliestpossible date.1365--13]B
2. It was decided that the note from the President of theUnited States could be published in the Press on Friday,the 22nd December.Canada. 3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff inquired whether,from the point of view of defence, it was necessary to warn theCanadian Government confidentially of the possibility of troublearising with the United States in connection with the peace overturesof the President of that country.The War Cabinet decided that no such action was necessary atthis juncture.The Russian 4- With reference to Minute No. 15 of the Meeting of the WarMission.Cabinet of the 20th December, the First Sea Lord asked that an armed merchant cruiser, which had already been waiting in orderto convey the Mission, might be released for service in the blockade,from which force it had been necessary to withdraw ships to pursuea German raiding vessel known to be at large in the Atlantic.The War Cabinet approved this proposal, provided that the cruiser should be ready when required at three days&apos;notice.Coal for Italy.The Shortage ofMerchant Shipping.Attended for Ques-tions 5, 6, 7, 8, 910, 11, &amp; 12:Sir.Albert Stanley,President of theBoard of Trade.Sir Joseph Maclay,Bart., ShippingController.Sir H. Llewellyn-Smith,    Perma-retary to theBoard of Trade.5. The War Cabinet had under consideration a note by thePresident of the Board of Trade, dated the 19th December, 1916, onthe subject of the coal situation in Italy, produced by the serious shortage of shipping (Appendix II), and were greatly impressed with the political importance of expediting the transport of coal tothat country.The Board of Trade were directed to keep in view thepossibility of utilising the French and Italian railways to supplement sea transport in case of emergency, forwhich the Italian Government should supply rolling-stock,owing to the shortage of it in France.The President of the Board of Trade stated that he hoped inthe course of a week or two some alleviation of the situation wouldbe produced by the cancellation of existing arrangements for limitingrates.The First Sea Lord explained the difficulties which theAdmiralty experienced in releasing any colliers at the present time.The War Cabinet decided that the Admiralty and War office should prepare and circulate full reports showing what usewas being made of every class of mercantile tonnage at their disposal for naval and military purposes, and givingreasons, where they exist, why more cannot be released.6. The Admiralty were also asked to examine and report to theWar Cabinet upon the possibility of carrying troops, guns,munitions, and stores on board cruisers in the Mediterranean, andas to the possibility of packing troops more closely on boardtransports.
Proposed Curtail-ment of DomesticCoal consumption in the United King-dom in order to freeLocomotives and&quot;Waggons for use inFrance.7. The President of the Board of Trade undertook to reportto the War Cabinet on the possibility, of reducing the,demands on railway transport in this country by curtailing the domestic consumption of coal in the United Kingdom.Transport Workers&apos;Battalions.Attended for Ques-tions 8, 9, 10, 11,&amp; 12:The Earl of Derby,Secretaryof Statefor War.Lieut.-Gen. Sir C. F.N&quot;. Macready, Ad-jutant-General tothe Forces.Brig.-Gen. A. C.Geddes, Directorof Recruiting.Sir Norman Hill.8. The Secretary of State for War reported to the War Cabinet,the details in regard to the development of the Transport Workers&apos;Battalion to a total of 10,000&apos; men, as approved by the late war committee on the 23rd November, 1916 (W.C.-91, paragraph 3).The essence of Lord Derby&apos;s statement was that, inclusive of thenumber of men at present in the Transport Workers&apos; Battalion, thetotal number would be brought up to approximately 5,000 men bythe end of the current week, and that another 5,000 would besupplied later on, briuging the gross total to be furnished up to10,000 men, as laid down by the late War Committee.He pointed out, however, that a fresh demand for 40,000 menof the same class had just been received from France, for work onthe railways, and that it might be necessary to delay somewhat theprovision of this extra 5,000 men.The Debadging of skilled Workers inShipyards.9. The Shipping Controller put forward the necessity forstopping the debadging of skilled workmen in shipyards and engineering shops. Lord Derby stated that nearly the whole of the skilled men in the shipbuilding trades, whose release from the army had been demanded, had either been returned by the army or hadbeen accounted for. The Director of Recruiting explained the safeguards which had been provided, and which, in fact, prevented the withdrawal of skilled workmen from shipyards.Having regard to the present critical situation in merchant-shipping and the importance of stimulating the output ofships, the War Cabinet were agreed that no men should be withdrawn from shipbuilding except after consultation between the Government Departments concerned and theShipping Controller.10. The Shipping Controller drew attention to the jointproclamation signed by the Secretary of State for War and theMinister of Munitions, entitled &quot; War Service Badges and Certifi-cates,&quot; dated the 18th December, .191.6 (Appendix III), more par-ticularly in reference to the following passage : &quot;And whereas the Minister of Munitions has now decidedthat such men are more urgently needed in the army than for munitions work.&quot;The War Cabinet, however, considered that the position was sufficiently safeguarded by the following extract from the note to the Proclamation : &quot; (1.) Men falling within the above-mentioned descrip-tion may be called to the colours by the competent military authority after consultation and by agreement with theGovernment Departments concerned.&quot;y
Discharge&apos; from; the; 11. The Shipping Controller reported that the shipbuilders and&apos;Service of Reservists&apos; engineers desired that those men who had been brought back fromSin Work &quot; coloiirs  aiid   were  working   in  the&apos; shipyards  should  be-m mg   or . discharged.The War Cabinet decided that Mr. Neville Chamberlain, theAdmiralty, the Board of Trade, and the Shipping Cort-troller should discuss this question and report.Restriction ofImports.12. The War Cabinet decided that an Interdepartmental Com-mittee should at once be assembled to consider andreport oh the question of the Restriction of Imports,,this Committee to consist of the following members : Lord Curzon (in the Chair).The Chancellor of the Exchequer, or a representativeof: the Treasury . .The Minister of Munitions.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.The President of the Board of Trade.The Shipping Controller.Captain Clement Jones (Secretary).That representatives of the Colonial Office and IndiaOffice were to be invited to attend when required, andthat the Heads of the Departments on the above committee should be accompanied, when necessary, bytheir experts.Conciliation and arbitration board for government employees.13. With reference to Minute 6 of the tenth meeting of the WarCabinet, held on 18th December, the War cabinet approved the report (Appendix IV) upon the termsof reference and the method of procedure for theConciliation and Arbitration Board for government employees, put forward by the Labour Minister.(Initialled) D.

Note communicated by the United States Ambassador, December 20, 1916iTHE President of the United States has instructed me to suggest to theGovernment of His Britannic Majesty a course of action with regard to the present war which he hopes that His Majesty&apos;s Government will take under consideration,as suggested in the most friendly spirit and as coming not only from a friend, butalso as coming from the representative of a neutral nation whose interests have been.most seriously affected by the war, and whose concern for its early conclusion arisesout of a manifest necessity to determine how best to safeguard those interests if thewar is to continue.The suggestion which I am instructed to make the President has long had itin his mind to offer. He is somewhat embarrassed to offer it at this particular time,because it may now seem to have been prompted by the recent overtures of theCentral Powers. It is, in fact, in no way associated with them in its origin,and the President would have delayed offering it until those overtures had beenanswered but for the fact that it also concerns the question of peace, and may best be considered in connection with other proposals which have the same end in view.The President can only beg that his suggestion be considered entirely on its own merits and as if it had been made in other circumstances.The President suggests that an early occasion be&apos;sought to call out from all thenations now at war such an avowal of their respective views as to the terms uponwhich the war might be concluded, and the arrangements which would be deemedsatisfactory as a guarantee against its renewal or the kindling of any similar conflict inthe future as would make it possible frankly to compare them. He is indifferent as tothe means taken to accomplish this. He would be happy himself to serve or even totake the initiative in its accomplishment in any way that might prove acceptable, buthe has no desire to determine the method or the instrumentality. One way will be as acceptable to him as another if only the great object he has in mind be attained.He takes the liberty of calling attention to the fact that the objects which thestatesmen of the belligerents on both sides have in mind in this war are virtually thesame, as stated in general terms to their own people and to the world. Each sidedesires to make the rights and privileges of weak peoples and small States as secureagainst aggression or denial in the future as the rights and privileges of the great andpowerful States now at war. Each wishes itself to be made secure in the future, along with all other nations and peoples, against the recurrence of wars like this, and against aggression or seliish interference of any kind. Each would be jealous of theformation of any more rival leagues to preserve an uncertain balance of power amidstmultiplying suspicions ; but each is ready to consider the formation of a league ofnations to insure peace and justice throughout the world. Before that final step can betaken, however, each deems it necessary first to settle the issues of the present warupon terms which will certainly safeguard the independence, the territorial integrity,,and the political and commercial freedom of the nation involved.In the measures to be taken to secure the future peace of the world the people andthe Government of the United States are as vitally and as directly interested as theGovernments now at war. Their interest, moreover, in the means to be adopted to relieve the smaller and weaker peoples of the workp of the peril of wrong and violenceis as quick and ardent as that of any other people or Government. They stand ready,and even eager, to co-operate in the accomplishment of these ends when the war is over with every influence and resource at their command. But the war must first be concluded. The terms upon which it is to be concluded they are not at liberty to.suggest; but the President does feel that it is his right and his duty to point out theirintimate interest in its conclusion, lest it should presently be too late to accomplish,the greater things which lie beyond its conclusion; lest the situation of neutral nations,,now exceedingly hard to endure, be rendered altogether intolerable; and lest more thanall an injury be done civilisation itself which can never be atoned or repaired.The President, therefore, feels altogether justified in suggesting an immediateopportunity for a comparison of views as to the terms which must precede thoseultimate arrangements for the peace of the world, which all desire and in which theneutral nations, as well as those at war, are ready to play their full responsi ble part..
If the contest must continue to proceed towards undefined ends by slow attrition untilthe one group of belligerents or the other is exhausted; if million after million of human lives must continue to be offered up until on the one side or the other there areno more to offer ; if resentments must be kindled that can never cool and despairsengendered from which there can be no recovery, hopes of peace and of the willingconcert of free peoples will be rendered vain and idle.The life of the entire world has been profoundly affected. Every part of the greatfamily of mankind has felt the burden and terror of this unprecedented contest of arms.No nation in the civilised world can be said in truth to stand outside its influence or tobe safe against its disturbing effects. And yet the concrete objects for which it isbeing waged have never been definitely stated.The leaders of the several belligerents have, as has been said, stated those objectsin general terms. But, stated in general terms, they seem the same on both sides.Never yet have the authoritative spokesmen of either side avowed the precise objectswhich would, if attained, satisfy them and their people that the war had been foughtout. The world has been left to conjecture what definite results, what actual exchangeof guarantees, what political or territorial changes or readjustments, what stage ofmilitary success even, would bring the war to an end.It may be that peace is nearer than we know; that the terms which the belligerents on the one side and on the other would deem it necessary to insist uponare not so irreconcilable as some have feared; that an interchange of views would clear the way at least for conference and make the permanent concord of the nations a hopeof the immediate future, a concert of nations immediately practicable.The President is not proposing peace ; he is not even offering mediation. He is merely proposing that soundings be taken in order that, we may learn, the neutralnations with the belligerents, how near the haven of peace may be for which allmankind longs with an intense and increasing longing. He believes that the spirit inwhich he speaks and the objects which he seeks will be understood by all concerned,and he confidently hopes for a reponse which will bring a new light into the affairs ofthe world.United States Embassy,London, December 20, 1910.
Coal Situation in Italy.(Note by the President of tbe Board of Trade.)At a conference held at Pallanza in August last, Mr. Runciman and Sir RennellBodd met Italian Ministers to discuss the coal situation in Italy. As a result of thenegotiations which then took place, a scheme on similar lines to arrangements already in force for the French Channel and Atlantic ports was extended to Italy and French.Mediterranean ports. This scheme provided (a) for limitation of the price of coalshipped to these ports, and (6) for limitation of coal freights.The minimum Italian requirements, of coal are estimated to be 800,000 tons per month. Of this amount it has been calculated that 600,000 tons were needed for purely Government requirements, such as the Navy, Munitions Factories, and StateRailways, leaving 200,000 tons per month for private consumption.During the first part of the present year coal was imported from the United Statesof America to Italy at the rate of approximately 200,000 tons per month. As theresult, however, of representations by His Majesty&apos;s Government as to the uneconomicaluse of tonnage employed to bring coal from the other side of the Atlantic, the Americanimport has recently been largely reduced, as will be seen from the following figuresgiving the amounts imported from the United States during the last three months : 1916. Tons.September . . . .. .. .. &apos;        .. 122,846October . . .. . . .. .. ..     77,288November .. .. ... .. .. .. 41,769Consequently, Italy is now practically entirely dependent upon this country forber supply of coal. The actual quantities shipped from this country to Italy duringthe last three months have been as follows : 1916. Tons.September .. ...... -. .. . .           .. 655,860October . . . . .. .. .. 655,748November . . .. .. .. ..           .. 502,262The total quantities of coal, therefore, received in Italy from both the UnitedKingdom and the United States during the three months mentioned only amounted to2,055,243 tons, as against the minimum requirements of 2,400,000 tons.The position during this month is even worse, since the Customs and Admiraltyreturns for the first twelve days of December show that only 147,062 tons wereshipped from this country to Italy. At this rate only some 375,000 tons will havebeen shipped to Italy by the end of the month, showing a total deficit of nearly 800,000tons for the last four months of the year.These figures are sufficient to show tliat the deficiency in Italy&apos;s essential suppliesof coal is increasing, and that urgent steps are necessary to meet what has become aserious situation.The principal reason for the failure of Italy to keep up her supplies is thedifficulty of obtaining neutral tonnage, owing to (1) the limitation of coal freights,which has made other voyages more attractive, and (2) the great increase in the activity of enemy submarines in the Mediterranean.In order to provide the tonnage urgently required by Italy, it has been agreedthat, as an emergency measure, an endeavour should be made to charter on a voyagebasis as many neutral vessels as may be available, even though the rates paid were inexcess of those fixed by the limitation scheme. I also understand that the admiralty have obtained the authority of the Shipping Controller to place at the disposal of theItalian Government, at the rates fixed under the limitation scheme, every availableBritish ship. Up to the present, however, these efforts have not met with any appreciable success.The provision of British tonnage for Italian needs is of course within the province of the Shipping Controller. The Board of Trade are, however, intimately concernedin preventing a breakdown in the arrangements for supplying Italy with the coal[18155-13] D
which she requires, and, owing to the great urgency of the situation, I venture to bringthe matter to the attention of the War Cabinet.   It seems essential (1.) That no stone should be left unturned by the Shipping Controller and theAdmiralty to obtain prompt British tonnage for the carriage of coal toItaly ; and(2.) That our control of the bunkering stations should be utilised in every possible way to bring pressure to bear on neutral shipowners to continue runningtheir ships in the Italian coal trade.It is unnecessary to emphasise the political anxiety which is being caused to theItalian Government. Continual representations are being received by the Italianrepresentatives in this country as to the embarrassing situation in which their government finds itself owing&apos; to tbe failure to maintain imports of coal on anadequate level.(Initialled) A.
