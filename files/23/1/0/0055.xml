APPENDIX I.Memorandum by the Army Council regarding the Supply of Men forthe Army.I. IN a memorandum dated the 28th November last the Military Members of theArmy Council brought to the notice of the Secretary of State for War, for theinformation of His Majesty&apos;s Government, the necessity of providing more men for theArmy, and stated that &quot; unless steps are taken at once by His Majesty&apos;s Government tointroduce some better system of utilizing the manhood of the nation, untrammelled byconditions that in practice now nullify to a great extent the object of the MilitaryService Acts, it will be impossible after April next to keep the armies up to strength.&quot;They suggested that &quot; the military age should be raised to 55 years and that all men upto that age should be utilized for such national service as His Majesty&apos;s Governmentdeem to be essential to the effective prosecution of the war,&quot; and they added that &quot; the gravity of the situation is the more serious because from April next onwards, if not before, fighting of a heavy and perhaps decisive nature may occur, and unless steps are taken at once to provide more men, there will not be sufficient time to train them before april, and therefore the armies must of necessity then begin to diminish in numbers.In our judgment such diminution, even if only temporary, will certainly postpone, andmay well prove fatal to, a successful termination of the war. In order to ensure successaot only should the present armies be maintained at full strength, but every effort shouldbe made to augment them.&quot;2. Since the date of the above-mentioned memorandum certain measures have been introduced with a view to providing more men, but they have proved to be quite inadequate. The recruits fit for General Service raised in January were 50,000, whereas the minimum number required was 100,000. Inclusive of this shortage of 50,000 in the january intake, the requirement for February is 170,000 men. The requirement for march is 130,000, and for April 120,000 men. The total required from 1st February to30th April is therefore 4-20,000 Category &quot;A&quot; men. The remainder of the 800,000Category &quot; A &quot; men required in 1917 must be forthcoming at subsequent dates.3. The situation foreseen by the military members in November last has now arisen, and the Adjutant-General has informed the Army Council that if heavy fightingis renewed in April next, as it probably will be, the strength of the armies in the fieldcannot possibly be maintained that month, no matter what steps are now taken.Further, as there is no evidence that recruiting will, under present conditions, be materially better in February it is hopeless to expect other than that there will be a continued diminution in the strength of the forces in subsequent months unless drastic *action is at once taken. It must also be remembered that the nature and duration ofthe fighting which may be expected to commence as soon as the season permits are notquestions regarding which the Entente armies will necessarily be able to decide for themselves.   The enemy will have something to say in the matter.4, The Army Council have for long held the opinion vide their Memorandum ofthe 6th April last &quot;that the circumstances attending the war are such as to render itabsolutely necessary that every man of military age who is physically fit and can be spared from Naval service or industrial or other indispensable employment should bemade available for service in the military forces.&quot; They hold this opinion even more strongly to-day, when Germany has apparently decided to employ for the coming decisiveeffort the whole of her resources of men. She has called up her 1918 Class and is nowcommencing to call up her 1919 Class, and new formations continue to be mobilized.During last year she formed 37 new divisions, six others are known to be in process offormation, and reports recently received indicate that 11 more are being formed.5. Various papers have been laid before the War Cabinet by the War Office, showing that the shortage of recruits is not so much due to the lack of men of military age, as tothe want of organization for utilising the men and women of the country to the best advantage, and pointing out how defective are the provisions of the MilitaryService Acts, and how excessive are the powers to exempt men conferred by thoseActs on Tribunals and Government Departments. The Council realize the difficultnature of the man-power question, and are aware that many conflicting factors enterinto it which affect Departments other than the War Office.   They do not consider,
therefore, that it is for them definitely to specify the steps which ought to be taken to remedy the grave situation now existing. They suggest, however, that at least legal powers should be obtained to cancel by successive age groups all existing exemptionswhether granted by Government Departments, by Tribunals, or under the MilitaryService Acts.6. They further suggest that, unless His Majesty&apos;s Government are satisfiedthat the present voluntary methods in regard to National Service can be relied upon toproduce forthwith the men required, legal powers should immediately be taken to compel all men up to the age of 55 or 60 to engage in work of national importancewhere and when required. In making this suggestion the Council are impressed bythe fact that delay in taking adequate action will mean not merely a correspondingdelay in making good the prospective shortage of men, commencing as from April next,but it will mean, also, as stated by the military members in November last, a certainprolongation of the war, and it may even be fatal to a successful termination of it.By Command of the Army Council,R. H. BRADE. ;2nd February, 1917. ;APPENDIX II.Second Report of the Director-General of National Service.BY Minute 1 (g) (i) of the 20th January, I was instructed by the Cabinet toproceed as in Part I of my Report of the 13th January, 1917, &quot; by releasing for thearmy all men of 18 to 22, but scheduling as exempt from military recruiting withinthose ages men in those occupations which are found to be of vital national importance, i.e., men employed in the production of steel, in the occupations coveredby the trade card scheme, and in agriculture, mines, and quarries, railway shops,transport work, aud shipyards.&quot; :After careful consideration, I have come to the conclusion that the limited actionpermitted under this decision would not release a sufficient number of men to justifyitself.Bearing in mind that men in munition works are already covered by the agreement,between the War Office and the Ministry of Munitions, and that the exemptions on personal grounds granted by the Tribunals would not be affected by the cancellation ofGovernment exemptions, the only available sources from which men of 18-22 couldbe obtained, are as follows : . (a.) Men employed in Government offices and holding exemption certificates fromtheir own departments.(6.) Men employed in certified occupations and protected through the listsprepared by the Reserved Occupations Committee, and issued to the tribunals by the Local Government Board,(c.) Men exempted by Recruiting Officers&apos; certificates.(Note. The only men of 18 to 22 remaining in non-essential trades are thosegranted exemptions presumably on personal grounds by the Tribunals.)With regard to (a.): I have prepared from returns made in October last in mypossession an approximate estimate of the number of men who would be released bythe cancellation of these certificates. This gives a figure of about 5,000, of whomprobably not more than 50 per cent, wmild be fit for general service or garrison dutyabroad. The total number of A and Bl. men obtainable from this source would probably not exceed about 2,000. - j;(6.) An examination of the latest list of certified occupations shows that a quitenegligible number of men below the age of 25 are protected in this way and of thesea considerable number would still be protected by the exclusions decided on by theCabinet.(c.) There are large numbers of these exemptions, but I understand that theyare being reviewed and as this is a. matter lying within the powers of the War Officealready, I think it may he assumed that they are looking after their own interests and doing all that is possible to secure every useful man for military purposes from this source.
Nnmber of Men required.	Progressive Total.	Month.	Age Groups of i Estimated Number of Men to Report.    Men in &quot; A &quot; Class.		Progressive Total.170,000 130,000 120,000 100,000 80,000	300,000 420,000 520,000 600,000	February March.. April May ... June ..	18-19 20-2i-22 23-24 25 26	176,000 161,000 121,000 65,000 67,000	337!000 458,000 523,000 590,000I suggest that the Act might specify the dates by which certain age-groupsshould report, leaving later groups to be called up by Proclamation, as required bycircumstances.A considerable number of men in category B 1 are also required, but, as I havenot got exact figures of the numbers in civil life at different ages, I have not includedthem in the above table.If the present, situation is critical, it would be necessary to abolish Tribunalappeals, with their consequent delays, for the age groups and medical categories inquestion.In accordance with Minute 1 (/) of the War Cabinet 39, I have consulted withthe Minister of Munitions upon paragraphs to replace 14, 16, and 21 in my previous report, and now submit amended paragraphs as follows: 14. The Director-General, having satisfied himself as to the necessity of any demand for labour, will allocate to the Government Departments (or by arrangement with the Government Departments to industries direct) the available supply,but he will retain the power to reallocate the labour so provided, or its equivalent,when, after consultation with the Government Department concerned, he is satisfiedthat the circumstances in which the original allocation was made no longer apply.16. Where, after consultation with the Government Department concerned, itappears that the circumstances are suitable, the men will be worked in squadscontrolled by civilian officers selected from the volunteers under the general directions of the district Commissioner and his staff.21. It rests with the Director-General of National Service to assign to their proper places in industry, occupation, or service all men and women who are availablefor the purpose, whether they are available voluntarily or whether they are available by means of any direct or indirect form of compulsory power, and whether they are for the time being engaged in any industry, occupation, service or not.In view of the foregoing circumstances, I have considered what steps could be taken  to bring about the prompt release of substantial numbers of men in categoriesA and Bl.The question as to whether it is more important to provide the drafts required forthe army to carry through the coming offensive with a risk of diminishing the outputof coal, munitions, &amp;c, or to maintain the latter at the risk of being unable to throwfresh forces into the struggle at the critical moment is not one which it falls withinmy province to decide.But I consider it my duty to point out that if men are to be obtained in time tobe trained and sent to the front, as planned by the Army Council, this can only bedone by prompt and drastic measures.I believe that if these measures were universal in character they would have avery much better chance of acceptance than any half-hearted attempts to deal witha critical situation, and so far at any rate as munitions works are concerned, I am convinced that the removal of men of military age and fitness would not dislocate theoutput provided that a little time were given for adaptation to new conditions.My information leads me to believe that many employers and trade unionistswould actually welcome the sweeping away of the present restrictions which protectcertain fortunate individuals whilst leaving others equally deserving to risk their livesfor the common cause.Assuming that the military demands are to be met, a short Act of parliament would be necessary and, in my opinion, this Act should cancel all exemptions up to theage of 31, but should provide that specified age groups should report to the recruitingofficers at stated intervals thus giving employers time to adjust their arrangements.The following table shows by way of illustration how the required numbers ofmen in Category A could be obtained : 
oThe Director-General will, as respects any work, occupation, or service which is controlled by any other Government Department, work in co-operation with that department, but the ultimate responsibility for the allocation of any men or womenavailable remains with him, and it follows that his final decision on the matter mustgovern the action of the Department, and that no Department should enter into anyengagement affecting the organisation, supply, or distribution of labour or other manor woman power in any other Department without consultation with him.In the event of any military forces being diverted for civilian labour by order ofthe Cabinet, the allocation of such labour shall be decided by the Director-Generalafter consultation with any Departments concerned.I ask for the approval of the &quot;War Cabinet to the above definition of my powers.(Signed) NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN.February 3, 1917.
