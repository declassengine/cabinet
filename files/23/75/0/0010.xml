MANCHURIA .League ofNationsReport.(previous reference:Cabinet 9(S3), Con-elusion 1,)1. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP.-42(33)) entitled &quot;The Far East and Geneva&quot;, to whichwas attached a copy of the Draft Report of theCommittee of Nineteen on the Chino-Japanese dispute.The part of the Report to which the Secretary ofState called the special attention of the cabinet was Part IV, which contained recommendations.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary was returning to geneva with the intention of expressing theacceptance by His Majesty&apos;s Government of theReport as it stood, and the Secretary of Statewished to be assured that the attitude of theForeign Office in this respect was approved.   Atthe end of the Memorandum some broad reflectionswere submitted as to possible future developments in regard to which decisions would have to be takenby the Cabinet,   These included:- (l) No resort tosanctions under Article XVI:    (S) The probability that the Government will shortly be challenged asto whether they would prohibit the export of armsand munitions of war to Japan If all the othercountries producing, or dealing in armaments did the same;    (3) The probable resignation of japan from the League.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs asked for a decision by the Cabinet on the questionof sanctions under Article XVI of the Covenant, andon the export of arms and munitions of war to thewarring countries.On the question of applying sanctions to Japanthere was general agreement with the Secretary ofState&apos;s view that we must dissociate ourselves fromany such proposal.    In reply to a question as to how
this could he presented to the public, theSecretary of state pointed out that this was amatter on which every country had to he the judgeas to how far it could put Article XVI into opera-tion.   We should have to state that we had no intention of doing so on this occasion.    It waspointed out that there might be pressure from someof the smaller Powers, but there was general agree-ment that the Naval Powers would have to be the judge on this issue.In connection with the export of war material to China and Japan, the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs drew special attention to theResolution by the Executive Committee of the Leagueof Nations Union, attached as an Appendix to his memorandum, and to evidence that there was likelyto be a sustained demand in the House of Commonsagainst allowing the export of war material to japan.    On the other hand, he pointed out thedifficulties that would arise if Japan were to stop a British ship carrying arms to China, and tothe possibility that Japan might even declare a blockade of China.   He was informed that in taking such action Japan would put herself wrong with international Law unless there was a formaldeclaration of war.   Neither party, however, was likely to desire a formal declaration of war:Japan because she preferred to characterise heraction as punitive operations, and. China becauseshe wished.to avoid a blockade.In the -course of the discussion the suggestion was made that we should ask other nations toagree to supply arms to neither side, and that,
irrespective of others, we might announce that thiswas our intention.    It was pointed out, however,that this course would not stop hostilities andwould not vindicate the attitude of the League,since it would hit China harder than Japan.    Theonly result would he to arouse the irritation ofboth contestants because they were not allowed, toplace contracts here.   Moreover,  the orders wouldbe placed in foreign industry instead of here.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve that the representativeof the United Kingdom at the Assemblyof the League should be authorised toaccept, on behalf of His majesty&apos;s government, the Draft Report of theCommittee of Nineteen on the Chino-Japanese dispute:(b) To approve the proposal of theSecretary of State far Foreign-Affairs that there must be no resort to economic or other sanctions underArticle XVI of the Covenant, and thatat any rate we must,  if necessary,dissociate ourselves from any such,proposal:(c) That the Governmentrs attitude towardsthe question of the supply of warmaterial to China and Japan should beconsidered in the first instance bythe Ministerial Committee on Disarm-ament, which had already arranged to meet the same afternoon at 4 p.m,,and subsequently at a Special Meetingof the Cabinet at 7-30 p,m.(NOTE:    The Secretary was instructedto arrange that, in theabsence of the President ofthe Board of Trade, thePermanent Secretary to theBoard of Trade should beavailable at the Meetingof the Ministerial Committeeon Disarmament.)
VISITS OP 2, The Prime Minister asked his colleagues to ministers^0 FOREIGN note that if any Minister should have occasion toCAPITALS.pay a visit to the Capital of a foreign countryhe should normally give ample notice of his visitboth to the Foreign Office and to the Ambassador,and call upon the latter soon after arrival.    Thiswas especially important if he wished to see any minister in the Government of the country concerned.Ministers at the head of Departments were askedto notify Under-Secretaries accordingly.The above procedure, of course, does not applyto passage through a foreign Capital on the way toother destinations.
(previous reference:Cabinet 68(32), Oon-clusion 1,)3 , The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for India (G.P.-39 ( 33))asking the approval of his colleagues to certain proposals as to the size of the Joint SelectCommittee on the Indian Constitution and the number and status of the Indians who are to participate in its work.    His own suggestion was that thestrength of the1 Committee should be about 20,10 from the Lords  (including the Chairman)  and 10from the Commons, and that the number of Indianparticipators (who would not actually be members ofthe Committee or be entitled to sign any Report)should be on a basis  of 15,  10 from British Indiaand 5 from the States.   Attached to the memorandum was an Appendix reproducing various pronouncementswhich have been made from time to time regarding theJoint Select Committee and the participation of indians.While realising that the Secretary of State might find, it impossible to limit the strength of theCommittee to the numbers mentioned above, the cabinet approved his proposals and agreed  That every effort should be madeto get the Joint Select Committeeon the Indian Constitution set up before the Easter Recess.joint SeleetCommittee onthe indian constitution,
ADEN. 4. The Cabinet had before them the followingFuture responsibility-i- documents on the question of the Future Responsi-bility for.bility for Aden:-(previous reference: A Memorandum by the Secretary ofCabinet 66 State for India (CP.-37 (33)) in(26), Con- which, after briefly indicating the elusion 4.) present position in regard to Aden,he asked his colleagues to decide the following questions:-(i) Whether, in their view, thebalance of advantage rests with the separation of Adenfrom India:and(ii) Whether, if so, the Secretaryof State might inform theGovernment of India that, inthe event of their agreeing to separation, His MajestyYsGovernment will be preparedto relieve them of the contribution at present paidby them towards military andpolitical expenditure at Aden:In paragraph 12 of his Memorandum he called attention to the following recommendations of the Committee ofImperial Defence in 1923:-&quot;(1)  That as Aden is an essentialfuelling station on the Imperiallines of communication to theFar East, it is of greatergeneral strategic importance tothe Empire than to India.      Ithas also a strategic importance-with regard to the Suez Canal,Somaliland and Arabia,- and is the site of an important wireless telegraph station.(2) That so far as strategical con-siderations, as set out in (1)above, are concerned, it would be advisable for the administrative responsibility for Aden to rest with the Imperial Government.&quot;(175th Meeting, held on July 23,1923) .A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Air (CP.-40 (33)),commenting on CP.-37 (33) andreplying to the above two questions as&apos;follows:-
(a) It is essential, on grounds ofImperial strategy, to retain the defence of Aden as a responsibility of the ImperialGovernment:(b) I agree that if the loss of any contribution by India is an inevitable consequence of the separation of Aden, then thereis no alternative but to accept it.The First Lord of the Admiralty and the Secretaryof State for War expressed verbally their concurrence in the views of the Secretary of State for Air asset forth in CP.-40 (33).The Chancellor of the Exchequer shared the viewthat Aden should be an Imperial rather than an Indianresponsibility, and that the implication that india would not in future contribute towards the expensemust be accepted.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve in principle that thebalance of advantage rests withthe separation of Aden from India,and that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould be prepared to relieve india of the contribution at present paidby them towards the military andpolitical expenditure there:(b) That the Government Department aconcerned should work out thedetails .
ADMIRALTYECONOMIES .Conditions of re-engagement,(previous reference:Cabinet 61(31), Con-conclusion 1.)5.   The Cabinet had before them a Most secret memorandum by the First lord of the Admiralty(CP.-33 (33)) on the subject of Conditions of re-engagement in the Royal Navy .   In this memorandum the First Lord stated that during the past year there had come to the notice of the Admiralty agreat deal of evidence indicating the existence inthe Navy of a widespread feeling that certain cutsadopted in the Defence Services in 1931, which werein excess of the general 10 per cent, cut in paymade in order to meet the financial emergency, hadunfairly penalised a large number of the men in theNavy - a view which was also generally held bythe Flag and Commanding Officers and Officers ofthe Fleet.   After setting forth the grounds onwhich this feeling was based, the Memorandum statedthat, subsequent to the Prime Minister&apos;s statement in the House of Commons on September 21, 19 31, theCabinet had ruled that in the case of the defence services the Prime Minister&apos;s pledge limitingreductions to not more than 10 per cent, should beregarded as applying only to the period, of a man&apos;sexisting engagement.    On entering into his secondengagement, however, he was required to accept thelarger reductions in pay and the lower pension sealswhich formed part of the original Economy measures.It was this ruling, as applied to the Naval Rating,which appeared to both officers and men.ito&apos; be unfair.The estimated cost of allowing men to retain their1931 rates of pay, i.e., the 1919 rates less 10 percent., on re-engagement, would be  6,000 in thefinancial year 1933, rising in subsequent years toa peak figure of  83,868 in 1939, after which thecost would fall gradually to  5,242 in 1948;   the-8-
total cost over the whole 16 years amounting to 809,000.   The Admiralty therefore asked permissionimmediately to issue the orders necessary for theremoval of what they strongly felt to be a fair and reasonable cause of a sense of hardship in the Wavy,The Cabinet were informed that the numbers ofWar Office personnel who re-engaged was small, andthe extent to which the War Office would be affectedby the adoption of the proposal of the First Lordof the Admiralty would involve very little money.The effect on the ^^s^^e^^^e^ Vas also reportedto present no difficulty.    It appeared that neitherthe Teachers nor the Police were affected.   Theproposal was, however, criticised on grounds ofprinciple.    Some importance was attached to the factthat the men affected had made their proposal throughthe constitutional channels, and there had as yetbeen no sign of political pressure being used, inspite of the strong feelings that existed in theNavy on the subject.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he wouldlike time to consider the matter further and, ifnecessary, to submit a Memorandxm.The Cabinet agreed  That the First  Lord of the admiralty should confer on the subject with theChancellor of the Exchequer, and, if agreement was not reached within three days,  they should bring the questionback to the Cabinet. f&quot;
t^HE agricultural marketing BILL.(previous reference:Cabinet 67(32), Con-clusion 6.)the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries (C.P.-38(3s)) covering the draft Agricultural Marketing bill which the Cabinet, at the Meeting mentioned in the margin, had authorised him to prepare.   The minister asked, if the Cabinet approved the principles involved,for authority to submit the Bill Immediately to theCommittee of Home Affairs, with a view to its intro-duction.   The Bill, the provisions of which had beendiscussed with the Ministry of Agriculture andFisheries, the Board of Trade, the Scottish Officeand the Home Office (i.e., as to the provisions relating to Northern Ireland), provided:-(i) (Clause 1) for the regulation of theimportation of any agricultural productinto the United Kingdom by Order by theBoard of Trade if it appears  (a) that unless the Order is made there organisation contemplated by an agricultural Marketing Scheme forthe time being in force cannot beachieved: or(b) that the Order is necessary to meetan emergency affecting the economic stability of any branch of theagricultural industry in the UnitedKingdom.(ii) (Clause 3) for the regulation by Orderof sales of home-produced agricultural products;(iii) (Clause 4) for the appointment of a market Supply Committee to advise theagricultural Ministers in connectionwith the discharge of their functions under the Act;(iv) (Clause 5) for the submission and approval of agricultural development schemes for the purpose of regulating the production, of &quot;secondary&quot; productssuch as bacon and hams;(v) For certain minor amendments to theAgricultural Marketing Act, 1931.
The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet thatthe Secretary to the Cabinet had received a letterfrom the Permanent Secretary to the Eoard of trade which stated that that Department was very much concerned with the Bill and that Part I would be mainly operated by the Board of Trade.   Moreover,the President of the Board of Trade was stated tohold strong views as to the policy involved.In these circumstances a request had been made thatthe Cabinet wovild not arrive at conclusions in theunavoidable absence &apos; through bereavement) of thePresident of the Board of Trade.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, while not asking for a decision committing the Presidentof the Board of Trade, hoped that, in view of the urgency of the matter, he might obtain a decisionof the Cabinet which could be held up until he hadthe &quot;All clear&quot; from the President of the Board ofTrade,After a preliminary discussion of the question the Cabinet agreed  That the question should be postponed for consideration at the next regular weekly meeting of the Cabinet.11-
financial policy ANDTRADEACTIVITY.(previous reference:Cabinet 46(32), Con-conclusion ion 12.)7. The Cabinet&apos;had before them copies of a most secret letter to the Prime Minister from the Committeeon Economic Information of the Economic Ad\n.soryCouncil (CP.-34 (33)), submitting their views on financial Policy and Trade Activity, which had been circulated for the information of the Cabinet on theinstructions of the Prime Minister,The Cabinet were informed that the letter beforethem was based on a misapprehension of the policy ofthe Ministry o&quot;P Health, and that some of the assump-tions as affecting the economic future were not borne out by the latest information at the disposal of theGovernment.The Prime Minister pointed out that there wereadvantages in obtaining these valuable Reports asto what informed and expert persons outside theGovernment were thinking, without trammelling themby contacts with Government Departments, which wouldhave the disadvantage of making those Departments tosome extent responsible.The Cabinet took note of this statement and of the Report.-12-
8.   The Cabinet had before them, the Report ofthe Severn Barrage Committee of the economic advisory Council (C.P.-35 (.33)), which had been circulated for their information by direction ofthe Prime Minister.The Prime Minister paid a tribute to the very valuable scientific information on which thisReport was based.    The only objection that had beenmade to publication was on the ground, that it mightcontain information of assistance to foreigners.The Cabinet were informed, however, that inhydro-electric matters some foreign countries wereahead, of us and that there was no objection fromthis point of view to publication.Another objection to publication was that theReport was so optimistic that it would lead to pressure on the Government to proceed with thescheme.   The Cabinet were reminded, however, that even if the scheme were approved to-day, no workaffecting unemployment would be begun for fiveyears, and the maximum employment would not bereached for ten years .    It would be 25 years before electrical current was produced, and then,by reducing the consumption of coal, the scheme would tend to increase unemployment rather thanotherwise .The Cabinet were also reminded that no decisionon the scheme could be taken until further investi-gation had been made of the proposed secondarystorage system on the River Wye (Para.36).The Cabinet agreed -(a) That the Report should be published:(b) That the Prime Minister should consult Lieutenant-Colonel Moore-Brabazon, the Chairman of the
Committee, as to the advisability of allowing further investigationon the question of the secondarystorage system.14-

Sir Ronald Lindsay had seen Mr.Roosevelt, but not much progress had teen made as yet.    It had been a good thing to get into personalcontact with the President-Elect, and Sir Ronald,was at once to meet Mr Hull, whose appointment as secretary of State would be announced almost immediately .-15-
