DEDUCTION and limitation of armaments .;he Disarma-ment Confer-ence .previous reference:Cabinet 1?(33), Con-clusion 2 .)F.R.Tanks .1. The Cabinet had before them an Immediatetelegram from the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs for the Lord President of the Council andthe Cabinet (G-eneva No.185 L,N.) stating that signor Mussolini had invited the Prime Ministerand Secretary of State to visit Rome and that ifthe Cabinet approved they were disposed to accept.The telegram further intimated that the PrimeMinister was contemplating making a statement inthe Conference, before leaving fo1&quot; Rome, probably on Thursday,    He proposed to outline the draftConvention and to stress the cardinal importance of reducing the political tension, without which no scheme of disarmament could be generally acceptable.Afterwards he proposed to circulate the text of thedraft Convention.    On the subject of Tanks thePrime Minister and Foreign Secretary pointed outthat the Convention would provide for the creationof a Permanent Disarmament Commission which, duringthe next five years, would have a variety of functions, and. invited the Cabinet to authorise thesuggestion that one of these functions should be toadvise upon the number of Tanks, if any, not exceed-ing 16 tons weight to be a^nualiy retained by each party, with a view to their reduction to the lowestnumber consistent with its national safety andobiigations .The Lord President of the Council informed theCabinet that the Prime Minister&apos;s probable programme would result in his return to London on Wednesdaynight or Thursday of next week.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs,who had spoken on the telephone to the PrimeMinister, said that the Prime Minister had not yetdecided to produce the draft Convention.
The Secretary of State for Air suggested thatthe Prime Minister and the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should he given some knowledge ofthe state of opinion in the House of Commons, asrevealed in the Debate on the previous day.    It waspointed out, however, that the more important criti-cisms in the House of Commons were perhaps not whollydisinterested and had been prompted to some extent by political motives.In the course of the discussion some doxibts were expressed, as to the expediency of tabling a draftConvention at Geneva at the present time.    It wassuggested, that such action might give Germany a pretext for abandoning the Conference and throwingthe blame on ourselves.   This would be particularlylikely to happen if the tables contained in theoriginal draft Convention were included.   The cabinet were reminded, however, that during the discussions at the Ministerial Committee on Disarmament theinclusion of the tables had been deprecated and itwas thought unlikely that they would be included Inany published draft.Considerable discussion took place on the subjectof the proposals as to Tanks.The Secretary of State for War pointed out thatin practice these proposals would involve thenecessity of justifying the number of Tanks were quired for Imperial defence before the permanent disarmament Commission.   Russia, presumably, would berepresented on this Commission, and would know exactlyhow many Tanks we required for the defence of thefrontier of India.
The suggestion was made that the proposals inthe draft Convention relating to manks, which hadrepeatedly been made public, including twice in white papers, were less liable to create difficulties atthe Conference than some other parts of our proposals,such as those relating to Aircraft,   This would be true more especially if the draft included the tableas to numbers of aeroplanes, in which Germany figuredas followsPRANCE .,. 500GERMANY        ... 0GREECE 75.In this connection, however, the attention of theCabinet was called to the view expressed in the telegram, &quot;that there will be no precipitate german withdrawal from the Conference&quot;,The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the lord President of the council should at once send a telegram to thePrime Minister and Foreign Secretarywelcoming their intention to acceptSignor Mussolini&apos;s invitation to visitRome:(b) That the Lord President of the council should follow the above telegram witha second telegram setting out the doubtsfelt by some members of the Cabinet asto the expediency of tabling a draftConvention in present circumstances,and summarising the objections feltunanimously by the Cabinet to the new proposal for Tanks .(A copy of the telegram referredto in (b) is attached in theAppendix .)
2,   The Lord President of the Council said thathe had to answer a Question that afternoon on the arrest of British subjects in Soviet Russia, and he proposed to give all available information.   he proposed to say that the Government took a very grave view of this matter.   The Lord President addedthat His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Moscow wantedSir Robert Vansittart to see the Russian ambassador in London and make certain representations to him.At present no action was    contemplated, but later on it might be necessary to take certain steps.   he added that the R,0,P. Company was suspected of propaganda here, and it would be an advantage ifevidence of this could be obtained.The President of the Board of Trade informed the Cabinet that directly the first telegram, hadbeen received announcing the arrest of Britishsubjects, he had suspended the Trade Negotiations.It was suggested that the Lord President mightannounce this in the House of Commons *The Cabinet agreed with the lord president of the Council that thePermanent Under-Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs should beauthorised to make to the RussianAmbassador the representationsasked for by Sir E. Ovey.
MEAT POLICY. 3. ^he Cabinet had before them the followingArgentine documents on the subject of the Argentine Ne^otia-Uegotia- -&quot;tions . t ions :-A Note by the President of the Boardof Trade (CP.-65 (33)) circulating a Memorandum on the present state ofthe negotiations.   After explainingtheir object, the President askedauthority to offer to guarantee tothe Argentines that in the next three years any temporary reductionin the amount of chilled beef allowedto be imported into this country which might be required to maintainprices at a remunerative level shouldnot In any one year exceed. 10 percent, of the imports from Argentinain the standard Ottawa period, i.e.,the twelve months ended June 30,  1932:A Memorandum by the Minister of Agri-culture and Fisheries (C .P.-66 (33))stating that the proposal in C.P.-65(33) raises questions of the gravestimportance to home agriculture:recalling the unrecorded conclusions reached at the Committee on commercial negotiations with Foreign Countries,according to which,  inter alia, forpurposes of negotiation with theArgentine, the United Kingdom Govern-ment was to agree not to impose a tariff on Argentine meat, but mightreserve the right to impose asufficient measure of quantitativSregulation to maintain a remunerativelevel of prices;    expressing a prefer-ence that restriction should not beemployed beyond, what was necessaryin order to maintain a remunerativelevel  of prices;    but, with theobject of assisting the Presidentof the Board of Trade in his negotia-tions, suggesting that a figure of15 per cent, should be given as themaximum beyond which we should bindourselves not to reduce Argentineimports of beef in any year.In the course of the discussion attention was(previous reference:Cabinet 68(32), Con-clusion 11.)F.R.drawn to a discrepancy between the figures for the exportation of chilled beef to this country fromArgentina, contained in C.P.-65 (33), para.6(7*7 million cwts, July 19 31 to June 1932) and thefigure of 442,000 tons in para.5 of CP.-66 (33).It was explained that the latter Memorandum had hadto be produced at very short notice and that there
The President of the Board of Trade made clearthat if there were anything in the nature of acatastrophic fall in the prices of beef, theArgentine Delegation were prepared, to enter into discussions with a view to a voluntary agreementsimilar to that concluded a month or two ago.   he saw no reason why this should not be included in theAgreement,The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs informed the Cabinet that he was satisfied that,whether the figure of temporary reduction amountedto 10 per cent, or to 15 per cent, of the importsfrom the Argentine, the Ottawa Agreement would notbe infringed.    It was possible, however, that someof the Dominions might suggest that the spirit ofthe Agreement was infringed.    At present some of theDominions were themselves making difficulties incarrying :out the Ottawa Agreements, and this made it important that we should be able to show that any action we took would violate neither the spirit northe letter.   He was satisfied, however, that thepresent proposals did not constitute, any such viola-tion.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, whileexpressing sympathy with the difficulties of thePresident of the Board of Trade,  felt botmd to explain jto his colleagues the effect of the 10 per cent,proposal on the agricultural industry.   A 10 per cent,reduction in the amount of chilled beef from theArgentine allowed to be imported into this country had already been made and had not been effective in raising the price of beef.   He illustrated this with ig-ures .    In the case of mutton and bacon there had- S-
been a rise, but there was nothing comparable in thecase of beef.    If the President of the Board ofTrade&apos;s proposal were carried out it would be tantamount to saying to the farmers that this wasall they would get in the lifetime of the present government.   The psychological effect would be very bad.    &apos;5hei:;sc*u%t*vap%%^%SMS^and farmers had been advised to turn to livestock.It was important that the market should not be toorigidly restricted and that there should be some playfor the farmers to work on.    He thought that the farmer ought to have the prospect of supplying 50per cent. of the whole market.   Even if the whole15 per cent, restriction which he proposed were applied to the Argentine trade and it were all givento the home producer and none to the Dominions, the farmer would only just get his 50 per cent.   Thepolitical aspects of the matter were of great import-ance,    From this point of view the pegging of themarket in beef for the lifetime of this Governmentwould be very regrettable ,    It would be said that once more the agricultural industry was beingsacrificed to the is*due^tM?a*4 p^u4a*W?0n.   The case against the Government in this respect would be an easy one to make, whereas the advantages of the ottawa Agreement, and in particular the exchangeadvantages, however great they might be, were difficult for most Members of Parliament to explain to their constituencies.The Secretary of State for Scotland supported the view of the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries ,as did the Home Secretary as a former Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries and one who had been present at the Ottawa Conference.
The President of the Board of Trade pointed outhow essential it was to obtain an agreement withthe Argentine Republic,     450,000,000 were invested in Argentina, considerable sums being held by people with small means,&apos;-, who depended on the dividends.The unfreezing of the frozen credits would result inthe setting free of vast credits elsewhere.   Atpresent traders were constantly coming to the Boardof Trade and informing them that they, could get orders and compete with their foreign competitors if theywere not obstructed by these frozen credits.   Byunfreezing credits the agreement would give animpetus to the City of London that would free manyof our industries from their trammels.   The coal trade, for example, particularly in South Wales, was largely dependent on orders from Argentina.   Theengineering industries were perfectly able to compete with other nations but could not get credits.The advantages of the Agreement, therefore, were by no means confined to the textile trade, to which hehad. referred earlier in the Meeting.   He recalled that an eventual Agreement with Argentina was alwaysin mind during the Ottawa Conference.    If the negotiation ,     . ,Argentine        /     &apos;- came to an end, not only should we lose the great advantages that opened up, especiallyin unfreezing credits and promoting trade, but weshould also fail to reach agreement with othercountries .   Prom the first he had considered thetariff policy of the National Government to be apivot round which negotiations were to be opened up.If these negotiations were now to be abandoned, hisusefulness would come to an end and he could not continue in such circumstances.The Secretary of State for War pointed out thatthe choice before the Cabinet did not lie between
a 10 per cent, and a 15 per cent, restriction.    if that were the case he would favour 15 per cent.The choice, however, as made clear by the Presidentof the Board of Trade, was between 10 per cent, andno Agreement,The Chancellor of the Exchequer drew attentionto the fact that the different points of view expressed on this question in the Cabinet did not follow Partylines at all, and that any division there was was rather on Departmental lines.   He could not put too strongly his sense of the disaster that would result from a breakdown in the Argentine negotiations,   Itwas not only a matter of unfreezing credits andrestoring trade, but also of dividends, which had their effect on revenue and on the movement towardswise spending.   Moreover, the reaction of a failure on the negotiations with other countries would putin question the whole of our foreign trade policy., In reply to a criticism that the textile trade wouldbe beaten out of the Argentine market by japanese competition as soon as the Japanese entered thatmarket, he pointed out that the population of theArgentine was of a totally different character tothat of West Africa, with a demand for a differentclass of goods.   He felt, therefore, it would be avery serious matter to take any decision which theBoard of ^rade felt would prejudice the conditionsof a successful issue to the  negotiations.On the other hand, he als o felt very strongly the arguments on the other, side, put forward so ablyand the Home secretary by the Minister of Agriculture - and Fisheries/,   he agreed that the case of British agriculture was an easy one to work up effectively. He shared the view which had been expressed by some of his colleagues,
however, that the difference between 10 per cent.and 15 per cent. was not really of vital importancein this connection.   There was something to be said for giving the farmer a margin to play with, butthe value of this must not be exaggerated.   On theother hand, the President of the Board of Trademaintained that to increase the restriction above10 per cent, was to lose the Agreement.    At thepresent time we were dealing with a situation inwhich meat consumption was declining. It waspossible, however, that in time the process mightbe reversed, which would help.In view of the above circumstances he made thefollowing proposal:-That we should suggest to theArgentine Delegation -(1) That there should be no.reduction of Argentine chilled beefimport beyond 10 per oenx ,without previous consultation;and(2) That there should be no reduction beyond 10 per cent,without a limitation onDominion imports.To the home-producers we should add -(5) Any natural expansion of themarket should be for thebenefit of the home-producerup to .... per cent.The suggestion was made that (3) was reallyredundant,The President of the Board, of Trade and theMinister of Agriculture and Fisheries and theSecretary of State for Scotland agreed that these were useful suggestions, but felt that, in viewof the importance of the subject, they requiredcareful consideration.
^he Cabinet agreed  (a) That, provided agreement wasreached between the Presidentof the Board of Trade, theMinister of Agriculture andFisheries and the Secretary ofState for Scotland, the formershould have authority to proceedwith his negotiations on the basessuggested by the Chancellor of theExchequer, as set forth above:(b) That if the Ministers primarily concerned considered necessary,a further Meeting of the cabinet should be held on the morning ofFriday, March 17th:(c) That the President of the Board ofTrade should use every endeavourto introduce into the ArgentineAgreement an undertaking by theArgentine Government that if therewere a catastrophic fall in theprice of meat they would enterinto consultation with us with aview to a voluntary arrangementsimilar to that recently concluded.
the SHOPS ACTS(V&apos;l2 to 1928)KbndmentIs ill.PA.4. The Cabinet had under consideration the ShopsActs (1912 to 1928) Amendment Bill, to be introduced in the House of Commons by a Private Member on Friday,March 17th.The Home Secretary informed the Cabinet thathe proposed to resist the above Bill,
tihe FACTORIES 5, The Cabinet had under consideration theItfD WORKSHOPS(BAKEHOUSES) Factories and Workshops  (Bakehouses) Bill, to beRILL.introduced in the House of Commons by a PrxvateMember on Friday, March 17th.The Home Secretary advised the Cabinet thatthe Debate on the Shops Acts(1912 to 1928) Amend-ment Bill was likely to occupy the whole time ofthe House of Commons, in which event the above bill would not be taken.

The Cabinet took note of a Memorandum by theMinister of Health (C ,P,-62 (33)) vc-irculating forthe information of his colleagues the final draftof the Circular to Local Authorities on the Reportof the Committee on Local Fxpenditttre.   The drafthad been revised in accordance with the conclusionsof the Cabinet Committee appointed at the meeting mentioned in the margin.
TRAWLING IN the moray FIRTHAND FIRTH OFCLYDE *(previous reference:Cabinet 15(32), Oon-clusion 6.)7, The Cabinet agreed  That the Papers recently circulated on the subject of Trawling in the moray Firth and Firth of Clydeshould be referred,  in the firstinstance, to the Cabinet committee set up on February 24th, 19 32, atthe Meeting referred to in the margin, which was composed asfollows:-TheTheTheTheTheTheTheMinister of Health (in home Secretary,Secretary of State for affairs,Secretary of State for Scotland,First Lord of the Admiralty.the Chair)ForeignMinister of fisheries,First CommissionerAgriculture andof Works*  .  *2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,March 15,  1933.
APPENDIX-.Following from Lord President of Council to PrimeMinister and Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.Your telegram No. 185 L.N. was discussed by   *Cabinet this morning.     I ought to mention that some members of the Cabinet are rather apprehensive as tothe expediency of tabling a draft Convention inpresent circumstances, lest it should give theGermans a pretext for leaving the Conference andcasting the blame on us.     The risk of this would ofcourse be greatly increased if the Tables of figurescontained in the original draft were included, butthe Cabinet presume that this is not your intention.It is however impossible here in London to appreciate the situation at Geneva with its complexities andanxieties, and the Cabinet were unanimous in leavingto you the decision, which will have their confidentsupport.The Cabinet felt that it was impossible toaccept your suggestion as to tanks.     It would inpractice compel us to justify the numbers of tankswe require for Imperial Defence (including the defenceof India) before the permanent disarmament commissionon which presumably Russia would be represented.During the discussion the suggestion was made that our proposals as to tanks, which are merely areaffirmation of a policy we have repeatedly announced,are possibly less provocative than some other partsof the draft Convention e.g. those relating to aircraft.In stressing the danger of Germany starting tobuild unlimited tanks you will of course not overlookthat tanks are very expensive and that Germany has
many other immediate requirements, including aircraft, as mentioned in Minutes of lastCabinet meeting.If you decide to table a draft ConventionCabinet hope you will agree to base any referenceto tanks on previous decisions, which have been several times reaffirmed.
