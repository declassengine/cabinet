(previous reference:Cabinet 10(33), Con-clusion 1.)F.R.The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet thatthe Ministerial Committee on Disarmament had that afternoon investigated the question of the proposedembargo on the export of arms to Japan and Chinaat some length.   Every course had been found to beopen to strong objections.    In the result, theCommittee had decided to recommend a policy which,since the Meeting, had been put into shape by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs in the followingnot e: -In the view of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentthe control of the supply of arms to theFar East cannot be satisfactorily and effectively dealt with except by aninternational agreement which actiiallysecures common action by all the armamentproducing and armament selling countrieswhether members of the League or not.The Government will be prepared to take part in discussion to secure such agree-ment and common action and hope that such discussion may speedily take place.Pending such agreement, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have decided for the time being to suspend the issue of licences underfuture contracts for the export of arms from this country to either China or Japan.At the same time, I must make it plain that this country - could not maintainisolated action for longer than the time which is necessary for the nations concerned to discuss and decide whether and what inter-national action is possible.   accordingly the suspension which I have just announcedis not intended to operate beyond one month from today.The above proposal raised the following questions:-(l) Why is your isolated action directed against China as well as Japan?Answer: If differentiation is to bemade, that should, be as theresult of international action.(2) What proposal do you intend to putforward at Geneva?Answer:    The whole subject is more compli-sated than appears at first   sight,and it is not possible at suchshort notice to answer.   We have proposed Anr?Embargo.
taken a definite step whichleaves out hands free, andwe now expect others to state their attitude .(S) Will you apply this unilateral actionto the wars now going on in SouthAmerica?There was general agreement in the purport ofthe first two sentences of the Cabinet Committee&apos;draft, namely, that the question was  one that couldonly be satisfactorily dealt with by an international agreement and that the Government must be prepared totake part therein;   but hesitation was expressed inacceptance of the proposal to suspend for a month theissue of licences under future contracts for theexport of arms from this country either to China orJapan.   This matter, the Cabinet were reminded, was of very great importance from the point of view ofthe armament firms and of unemployment.   This coumtrywas very dependent on the private armament firms, andthe Principal Supply Officers Committee were veryuneasy about their continued decline.    ^he moment had now arrived when both Japan and China were desirous of placing orders .    If we suspended licences unilaterallyit meant that the orders would be placed abroadinstead of in this country.    If the.orders were placedabroad today, this would continue in the future.The effect of our policy would be to deprive ourown firms of orders and to benefit the armament industry of other countries, without in any waypromoting the policy of the League of Nations.   as president Hoover had said,  it was a futility to dealwith the question except on an international basis.It was suggested, therefore, that instead of takingunilateral action as proposed, we should at once
ilOTE: Some of the objectionsibo stoppingiLicences toIJapan, whilefpermittingIthem to China,lare referred[to in Cabinet110 (33), page12.Initiate enquiries with the Governments of the foreignarmament-producing countries and take the initiative in a discussion at Geneva with a view to stopping thesupply of arms both to China and Japan.The Cabinet were informed that the ministerial committee had discussed similar proposals.    One greatdifficulty was that no war material could be exported from this country without a licence from the government if export licences were granted it would mean that theGovernment of the United Kingdom., which was about to subscribe at Geneva to a Report condemning the actionof Japan in Manchuria, would be accused of aiding andabetting Japan in her misdeeds,    Other countries werenot in the same position, and some (the United Statesof America, for example) had at present no legal powerto stop the export of arms .    It was owing to thispeculiar position in which we were situated that the ministerial Committee had decided to recommend a suspension of licences.   A month had been fixed asthe period, as, from an administrative point of view,this seemed to be about the shortest time for which a suspension would be of any value.The Cabinet were informed that the fixing of solong a period would injure our industry, as all thelarge orders were likely to be placed within a month.The deliberations of the Cabinet led to theconclusion that immediate action ought to be taken through the ordinary diplomatic channels to sound theother armament-manufacturing countries as to what line they were proposing to adopt.    It was realisedalso that the question was almost certain to be raised at Geneva immediately after the adoption on Friday,February 24th, of the Report now before the Assembly.In the circumstances it was felt that the issue of licences ought to be suspended,  but that it was
$ -unnecessary to fix a limit of time, and that it wouldhe better to indicate that the suspension would onlylast so long as       was necessary to conclude inter-national agreements as to the line to be adopted, withthe understanding that other nations must not beallowed to obtain trade advantages over us .The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should, through the normaldiplomatic channels, at once consult the Governments of the principal armamentmanufacturing countries as to what coursethey proposed to adopt concerning thesupply of armaments to Japan and China in the present emergency:(b) That the issue of licences under futurecontracts for the export of arms fromthis  country to either China or japan should be&apos;temporarily suspended pendingthe result of the enquiries through diplomatic channels referred to in (a)and probable discussion;, of the question at Geneva, with the understanding thatopportunity must not be given to othercountries to obtain trade advantages outof this situation at our expense:(c) That the line to be taken in parliament should be that, in the view of HisMajesty&apos;s Government, the control of thesupply of arms to the Far East cannot be satisfactorily and effectively dealt withexcept by an international agreement whichactually secures common action by all the armament-producing and armament-sellingcountries, whether members of the Leagueor not;   that even before the Assemblyhad met to take its final decision onthe dispute His Majesty&apos;s Government hadtaken urgent steps to ascertain the viewsof the other armament-producing countries and had decided to suspend the issue of export licences under future contracts for the export of arms from this countryto either China or Japan pending agreementwith the other countries concerned.   as other countries could not be allowed toobtain trade advantages at the expenseof this country, however, it must be made plain -that this country could not maintainisolated action for longer than the time which was necessary for the nations con-eerned to discover and decide whether and what international action is possible.2, Whitehall gardens.w.i,February 22, 19 33
