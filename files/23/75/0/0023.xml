1.   The Attorney-General informed the Cabinet thaton Monday he had received a letter from Mr JusticeMacnaghten, one of the High Court Judges, announcinghis intention of presenting a Petition of Right againstthe legality of the cuts in Judges&apos; Salaries.   Reunderstood that the senior High Court Jiidge was inagreement, and that two other Judges had wished to associate themselves with Mr Justice Macnaghten, butthat he had decided to proceed alone.    It was possiblethat the two other Judges might present their ownPetitions.    Mr Justice Macnaghten had said that he hoped his Petition would be presented on the 4th or5th April.    The ordinary procedure would be for the petition of Right to be addressed to the HomeSecretary, who would refer it to the Attorney-general for remarks.    This normal procedure would take abouta month.   Most likely it would be impossible to refusea fiat.    In the ordinary way the Petition would thengo to a High Court Judge, with a right of appeal by either party to the Court of Appeal and the House ofLords ,    This procedure, hoxvever, was inapplicable tothe present case, as the High Court Judge and the judges in the Court of Appeal would be personallyaffected.    There appeared to be three possibleprocedures:-(l) To restore the cuts in salaries:(2) ^o pass legislation declaring that thepresent salaries were deemed to havebeen included in previous legislation:(3) ^o refer the issue to the JudicialCommittee of the Privy Council underthe Act of 1833 and to tell Mr JusticeMacnaghten and the other Judges concerned that this was to be done.It would be difficult to constitute the JudicialCommittee so as to avoid including any Judge whosesalary was involved, but there were four or five
Judges who were on pension and might be nominated.The Attorney-Generalrs own view was that the Judgeswere not likely to win their case, but it was con-eeivable, of course, that they might.    If the Cabinetmade up their mind that an adverse opinion by theCourt could not be allowed to upset the decision ofParliament, it might be best to legislate and toinform the Judges concerned of this intention andthus to deter them from presenting a Petition.The Cabinet were informed that some of the cireum-stances mentioned by the Attorney-General had been published in the Press of the same day.The discussion showed that there could be noquestion of restoring the Judges&apos; salaries.    Retro-spective legislation, it was admitted, was unpopular,but it was felt that this would be necessary if the judges concerned insisted on proceeding with theirPetition of Right.The Cabinet were reminded that the JudicialCommittee could not give a decision, but only an opinion.    If the Jxidges were asked to bind themselvesto accept the opinion of the Judicial Committee inadvance, the Government could hardly refrain from giving a similar undertaking.    If the opinion wereagainst the Government it would create a very difficults situation.After discussion the Cabinet agreed  -(a) That there could be no question of restoring the Judges&apos; salaries,having regard to the disaterous efect that it would have on other classes of the community that had submitted to cuts in salary or. pay:(b) That, if necessary, legislation should be introduced to validatethe cuts on Judges&apos;  salaries,whether such legislation waspreceded by an inquiry by theJudicial Committee of the privy council or not:
(c) That the Lord. Chancellor and theSecretary of State for War should see Mr Justice Macnaghten and theother Judges concerned and inform them of the Government&apos;s intentionas set forth above, so as to give them an opportunity, if they should think fit, of refraining frompresenting their Petition of Right.(mhe Attorney-General withdrewat this point .)
it 7?(previous reference:Cabinet 22(33), Con-clusion 2 .)F.R.2. ^he Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,who was to introduce the Russian Goods (ImportProhibit ion)Fill in Parliament the same afternoon,drew the attention of the Cabinet to two points that were liable to be raised in debate.    First, the bill had no time limit, so that it not only gave unlimitedpowers to the Executive, but gave them for ever;    and,second, even though Parliament was sitting, when thepowers conferred by the Bill were put in operationno opportunity was provided for consulting the Houseof Commons,The President of the Board of ^rade pointed outthat it had been found that Orders could only be issued under the provisions of the Customs Consolidation act of 1B76, the powers under which were exercised by proclamation.   Hitherto the Russian Soviet had been at a great advantage in trading with us for the reason that their trade was all centralised in the Government,which enabled them to control every sort of trade,whether in imports or exports .    He had hoped that thepowers to be conferred by the Russian Goods (import prohibition) Bill would place the Government in astrong position in negotiating the new Trade Agreement,The Cabinet were also reminded that the time to terminate, the Bill would come when a reasonable ^radeAgreement was reached with Russia.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat, in view of the discussion, it was unnecessaryfor him to press his questions further.o4ie RussianGoods (import prohibition)Bill&apos;
pHE british&apos;ar debt totfle unitedstates of America,(previous reference:Cabinet 10(33), Con-clusion 9,)3. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet thathe and his colleagues on the American Debts Committee .had held various conversations, some among themselves and others with Mr Norman Davis, the American repre-sentative.   He thought he was right in saying thathis colleagues on that Committee wished him to proceedto the United States of America and to sail on Saturday,April 15th.   He wanted the Cabinet&apos;s endorsement,because a message would have to be sent at once tothe British Ambassador in Washington so that president roosevelt would&apos;send the official invitation which itwas known to be his intention to do if assured of afavourable response.   The Prime Minister&apos;s intention was to sail and return in the same ship and only toremain in America for four days.    His -object would beto make contact with President Roosevelt and to makethe best he could of his opportunities.   He mighthave to leave some Experts behind to go into questionsof detail, affecting, for example, the World monetary and Economic Conference.The Chancellor of the Exchequer strongly pressed the Prime Minister to go to Washington, and emphasised the importance of securing, if possible, a moratoriumin respect of the payment due on June 15th.The only doubts expressed as to the desirability&apos;of the Prime Ministers visit were lest he should return without having secured any result,  or that the visit should be tinged with disappointment.The Cabinet were reminded, however, that president roosevelt was known to desire the visit.    If, later on, the United States Congress should refuse a moratorium and it was known that the Prime minister had not been willing to accept the Presidents invita-tion to Washington, the failure would be laid at hisdoor.
The Cabinet were reminded, however, that even ifthe Prime Minister secured a suspension of thepayment due on June 15th, he would not be able to announce it on his return, since President Rooseveltalone could do that when he had obtained his powers from Congress.^he Cabinet were also reminded that the PrimeMinister was Chairman of the World Monetary andEconomic Conference,    As President Roosevelt couldnot leave the United States of America it was onlynatural that the Chairman of the Conference should visit him in order to advise him as to the probableatmosphere of the Conference, explaining, forexample, that without some kind of a Debt settlement the Conference would have no prospect of success.After this discussion the Cabinet strongly urged the Prime Minister to accept an invitation from president Roosevelt to visit the United States ofAmerica, and agreed  (a) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should at oncenotify His Majesty&apos;s ambassador at Washington&apos; that the PrimeMinister had acceded to the Cabinet&apos;desire that he should express a willingness to accept an invitation to visit Washington^  leaving on saturday, April 15th:(b) That when the time came for anannouncement it should be made clear that the Prime Minister was going at the express wish of theCabinet and that the object of his visit was not to negotiate but tomake contact with the President:(c) That whatever the result of thePrime Minister&apos;s visit, the cabinet would give.him their united support.
THE BUDGET. 4. The Cabinet agreed  (a) That a Special Meeting to -consider(Previous                            the Budget should be held on reference: THURSDAY, APRIL 15th, at 11 a .m.,Cabinet 22 . in the Prime Minister&apos;s Room at(52), Con- the House of Commons:elusion 1.)(b) That even more than usual vigilancewould be required to avoid leakage of Budget secrets owing to theV(3$)t Cabinet Meeting taking place sometwelve days before the Budgetannouncement.
ItteNS   RES- 5, The Home Secretary informed the Cabinet, as aIrOTlONS;.T__ matter of urgency, that in consequence of events mM^xpsion offirman jews,       Germany there had been a considerable increase in thenumber of Jews entering this country under the Aliens/previousInferences:       Act.    In two days there had been about one hundredICatinet 171(29), Con- admittances.    Most of these were persons of thelelus ion 8:land Cabinet       professional classes on temporary visits.   There hadIj3 (33), Con-lelusioh 3 V&apos;)       been some entries, however, of Jews who were completely K. destitute.    Representatives of the Jewish community had. visited the Home Office with a scheme to providemoney and work for destitute Jews.   These representa-tives had anticipated that the numbers might be as many as 3,000 to 4,000,   ^he matter was rather compli-cated, and he thought it was one for a Cabinet Committee,A short discussion confirmed the view of the HomeSecretary.   As against the objection of admittingpersons who might become destitute was the guarantee of the Jewish community, as well as evidence that some industries (e.g, the fur industry of Leipzig) mightbe transferred to this country.The Cabinet agreed  That a Cabinet Committee, composed asfollows  The Home Secretary (in the Chair),The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs and/or a representative,The Secretary of State for theColonies and/or a representative;The President of the Board of Tradeand/or a representative.The Minister of Labour and/or arepr es representative ive,The First Commissioner of.Works -should meet to examine the proposals made to the Home Secretary on behalfof the Jewish community.

In the course of the discussion referred toin the preceding Minute, the Prime Minister suggested to his colleagues that in the case of many Sub-Committees it might be an advantage to admit the(29), C onelusion 3.)    presence of a limited number of Official advisers.-9-
rnHE IRON ANDjgijEEL JNDUSTRY.7.The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer (C.P.-88 (33)) on!e-organic a-lion of.IfPreviousI Reference:I Cabinet 91(32), Con-I elusion 15 *the subject of the Reorganisation of the Iron andSteel Industry.    In his Memorandum the Chancellorof the Exchequer recalled that when, in April 19 32,Duties were imposed on iron and steel on the recommend-ation of the Import Duties Advisory Committee, he had reported to the Cabinet that one of the intentions ofthe Committee in recommending the Duties was to stimulate reorganisation in the industry.   The Commit-tee had been actively pursuing this object, and aNational Committee of Representatives of the industry had now submitted a scheme under which reorganisationcould take place.    Attached to the Memorandum werethe Papers he had received on the subject from sir george May, and the terms of the reply he proposed tomake (which had been agreed with the President of theBoard of Trade) were set out in the Memorandum,After hearing a full explanation of the position from the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the cabinet agreed  To approve the terms of the draft reply, included in CP,-88 (33),to be sent by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer to the Chairman ofthe Import Duties Advisory Committee.

The announee-ment had not been well received, as a large part ofthe Bouse of Commons had anticipated that Income tax would be imposed on the Societies .   He drew theattention of the Cabinet to the Report of theCommittee, which was attached to C.p .-19 (33), and pointed out that it would be difficult to find reason-able grounds for not acting thereon.    In all thecircumstances, the onus of proving the contrary would rest with those who objected to the Report.The subject was discussed mainly in its political aspects .There was not time to complete this discussion,which was adjourned until the same evening at 9 p.m.in the Prime Minister&apos;s Room at the House of Commons.-is-

No objection was raised bythe Authorities concerned, and in these circumstances the Minister of Transport considered that no objectionneed be taken to the issue of the necessary consent,in which the Minister of Health and the first commissioner of Works concurred.   The expenditure involved was  275,000,    and about a year&apos;s work would be provided for 1,400 men.   The Minister ofTransport asked authority to arrange for a statement to be made in the House of Lords at an early date . -The Cabinet were informed that Chelsea borough council were to consider the question the same afternoon, and it was anticipated that they wouldnot raise any objection to the application of theLondon Power Company, Ltd.
