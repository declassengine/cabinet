Con-. elusion 9-*)Dis armament *(previous reference:Cabinet 66If 38). Con-plus ion 1 *)en,1;   The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that,although there was some regular business on the agenda paper, his main purpose in summoning the Meeting hadbeen to consider the preparatory work for the coming session of Parliament,   He then referred to theprincipal questions of policy that were likely to arise ,The first question was Unemployment, which wasbeing attacked on two main lines :*-(l) The stimulation of trade, on which aCommittee, composed partly ofMinisters and partly of business men,presided over by the Secretary ofState for the Colonies, was at work,though, on such a subject results were bound to require some time^and(S) Contact with,the Council of social services in their work with the objectof maintaining the moral of the unem-ployed.   This branch of the subjectextended to work on Land Settlement,o^ which the operations  of the Societyor Friends provided the best example,The second large question was Transport,   This was raised, by the situation arising from the Wages BoardReport ,   The Salter Report was also involved, butthe problem of Transport went much further than these reports, and the Cabinet would have to consider thelarger problems for carrying on the work begun bythe London Passenger Transport Bill,The third big question was Disarmament.   The presentsituation arose out of the success of our lead inDecember in getting Germany back to the Conference,-which created problems of its  own. (See also Conclusion3). -There were other important questions, but if theCabinet could get their views olear on these main issues he thought they could, see their way throughthe coming Session,

Con-conclusion 7,)3)  SocialServicesand LandSettlement.(Previous -Reference&apos;Cabinet  35^33). Con-clusion 6.)3^(35)^,4.)Turning to the subject of Ministerial responsi-bility for Unemployment questions, the PrimeMinister pointed out that a difficult position was created so far as the House of Commons was concerned.   He was anxious to avoid any impression in the House of Commons that any one minister could be treated as a Minister of unemployment to whom Questions could be addressed on everyaspect of the subject.   He was particularly anxious that the different aspects of the question shouldbe Departmentalised:    for example, the Minister ofLabour should be responsible, whether in answer to questions or in Debate, for Unemployment figures,the Unemployment Register, Employment, and theMeans Test, and all matters cognate thereto9Similarly, all matters relating to the developmentof trade in relation to unemployment would fall within the province of the President of the Boardof Trade.The question of Social Services raised a little difficulty. Land Settlement, at any rate, shouldbe dealt with, so far as England was concerned, bythe Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, and, sofar as Scotland was concerned, by the Secretary ofState for Scotland.Thus the brunt of the work on these subjectswould fall upon the Minister of Labour, the Presidentof the Board of Trade, the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries, and the Secretary of State for Scotland,to whom he would add the Minister of Health on certain aspects of these questions.Later in the Meeting the Prime Minister invited the attention of his colleagues to the Weekly Listof Questions Awaiting Consideration.-2-
(a) That there should be no ooncentrationof Parliamentary responsibility forUnemployment on any one Minister, andthat the normal allocation of responsi-bility as indicated above should be adhered to as closely as possible:(b) ^hat Ministers should examine the weekly List of Questions AwaitingConsideration by the Cabinet, andthat each Minister should report as early as possible when the legislation or other business which fell within his province would be ready.
2. The Prime Minister reminded the cabinet of a rule adopted by some previous governments which had become a general understanding, that noMinister should take part in a by-election.    It hadbeen strongly urged upon him., however, that now and again, for some special reason, an exceptionmight be made.   He was advised by the parliamentary secretary to the Treasury that such a case arose inconnection with the forthcoming election in EastFife, where there was a strong desire that theAgricultural Policy of the Government should beexpounded by the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries .   He asked for the views of his colleagues on the subject.The Cabinet were reminded that the moment the rule had been broken in the case of one constituencyit would be extremely difficult to resist equallycompelling reasons that would be raised in favour ofother constituencies.   They were also reminded thatthe past the custom of abstention from, participation in by-elections had been taken to apply to Leaders of theOpposition as well as to Cabinet Ministers.   At thepresent moment some of the Leaders of the opposition were not observing the practice.The Cabinet agreed  That the practice that cabinet ministers should abstain from taking part in by-elections shouldbe adhered to, but that this shouldnot apply to Ministers who were not members of the Cabinet.
3. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (C.P.-3(33)) oh the subject of the future procedure of theDisarmament Conference, in which he stated that unless a new direction and an effective lead could be givento the Conference now, the impetus which it hadreceived from the return of Germany would quicklydie away and the Conference would reach a completestandstill.   A new programme, firmly promoted andboldly pursued, was the sole hope, and only by doingour utmost to give the right lead ourselves could weescape the verdict, undeserved as it might be, thatit was our own shortcomings which had eaused theConference to fail.    In an effort to provide such a lead, the Secretary of State attached to his Memo-randum a draft Programme of Work for the Conference,drawn up in the form of a Resolution to be adopted bythe General Commission, and he asked for authority,in case of need, to put forward suggestions on theselines.   He had seen Mr Henderson, who was contemplatingputting forward in outline a new Convention as a basis,of work by the Conference, Article 1 of which dealtwith &quot;Security&quot; and Article 2 with &quot;Equality of Rights&quot;.If discussion began promptly on the subject-matter ofthese two Articles the Conference would soon reach the heart of the matter, but with what consequences hewould not venture to predict.There was general agreement in the Cabinet that a programme put forward by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, after consultation with representativesof the other leading Powers at Geneva, would be more likely to expedite the work of the Conference than oneemanating from the President of the Disarmament Confer-ence.
The Cabinet were reminded that a number oxdocuments had been prepared with a bearing onsubjects raised in C .P .-3 (.35) which were not beforethe Meeting.   These documents had been intended forthe Cabinet Committee, which originally was to have met before the Cabinet.    In the circumstances it wassuggested that the Cabinet could not take any decision that afternoon.In the course of the discussion certain commentswere made on the draft programme, e,g.:-(l) That the utmost care should be takento arrange that the phrasing of theprogramme of work should not commitHis Majesty&apos;s Government in any wayto the principles  of the French SectirityPlan, or any other matter that had not received the approval of the Cabinet:(2) That in technical questions relatingto such matters as the weight of tanks,calibre of heavy guns, weight of aircraft, and so forth, the programme as at present drafted was misleading.It was suggested that in some of the paragraphs the Disarmament conference was being invited to adopt figures as maxima which had been acceptedby the Cabinet as minima, and thatin other paragraphs figures werebeing suggested as a basis for thework of the Disarmament Conferencewithout mention of the conditionsattaching to their acceptance by theCabinet and the Defence Departments;(3) That the tendency of the draft was toconfuse a programme of work for theConference with a programme to whichHis MajjestyTs Government could assent.It was suggested, however, that most ofthe difficulties in the programme inits present form might be met by re-drafting.The Cabinet agreed -To adjourn the question until a report was received from the Cabinet Committeewhich was meeting on the morrow.
DISARMAMENT. 4. In the course of the preceding discussion theEmployment Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to of the RoyalAir Force in a Memorandum he had circulated (0,P.-4 (.33)) coveringIraa *a Despatch from Sir Francis Humphrys on the subject(Previous of the use of aircraft in Iraq,   This Despatch, reference:Cabinet 37 pointed out, had an important bearing on Air(32), Con-elusion 4.) Disarmament questions.In the absence of the Secretary of State for air the Cabinet did not discuss this Memorandum, ofwhich they took note for future reference,   ifnec essary .
MANCHURIA.II     ...The LyttonReport.e * *(previous reference:Cabinet 67(32), Con-clusion 2).F.R..7 *V5.     The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, whohad returned by air the same afternoon from Geneva,gave the Cabinet an account of the present positionof the question at issue between China and Japan beforethe Committee of Nineteen at the League of Nations.He indicated that the first stage in the applicationof Article 15 of the Covenant to the dispute, namely,the stage of conciliation, was nearing an end.     thanks to the intervention of Mr. Lester, the representativeof the Irish Free State on the Council, to whom theForeign Secretary had spoken, the Committee ofNineteen were willing to accede to the Japanese proposal that the United States and Soviet Russia should not beinvited to take part in the proposed ConciliationCommittee.     Nevertheless, the Secretary of Stateadvised that China and Japan were so far apart thatconciliation offered little prospect of a succesful issue.      If conciliation failed the League of nations would have to present a Report.     He himself stronglyfavoured a short Report, adopting the Lytton Report in preference to a new Report   on these involved circumstancessince a new Report was likely to lead to interminablediscussion.The Secretary of State then gave an account of a conversation he had had with a Chinese delegate, whowas about to become Chinese Minister in London.      Hehad been somewhat re-assured to find that the Chinesedid not expect very much from the League of Nations.They were now more and more inclined to rely on theirown forces and strength, and thought they would be ableto put up considerable resistance.     The Chinese delegateanticipated that the Japanese intentions were of a widerscope than had hitherto been believed, and involved the
creation of a buffer State, South of the Great Wall ofChina, and absorption of Manchuria by Japan.     he believed, however, that in the long run events would compel the Japanese to recede.The Secretary of State emphasised that the important new factor in the situation, compared with a few months ago, was that nearly every responsible person nowrealised that the application of sanctions to this dispute was not feasible.The Secretary of State reviewed the possibilitiesof the future in the event of a Report   which was boundto reflect to some extent on Japan.      If Japan didnothing an odd situation would arise, since, notwith-standing the implied censure of the League, Japan, asa permanent Member of the Council, would continue toparticipate in all the work of the League.      Anotherpossibility was that Japan would withdraw from theLeague.      A third possibility, which might be pressed by the small Nations, was that Japan should be expelledfrom the League.     A fourth possibility was Japanesewithdrawal from the Disarmament Conference.     He didnot ask for any decision at the moment.
PERSIA.*   *   VThe threat to the Anglo-Persian oil company....(Previous: Reference:: Cabinet 67(32), Con-clusion 3).3^1^)3.6.     The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that he had asked Sir John Gadmanto come out to Geneva in connection with the disputeftwith Persia.     The position that the British representa-,&apos;;)tive would have to make clear at Geneva was that theAnglo-Persian Oil Company could not proceed tonegotiate with the Persian Government on the basis that the Concession was cancelled.
i &quot;jTHE ECONOMYCUTS.m * *(previous reference:Cabinet 61(31), Con-elusion 1).F.R.7.     The Prime Minister said that a number of questions were to be asked on the re-assembly ofParliament.     He would not raise the question today, but he instructed the Secretary to keep it onthe Agenda Paper of the Cabinet.
NAVAL OONSTRUO-   8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theTTON FOR 193o^irst Lord Qf the Admiralty (0.P.-444 (32)) asking(Previous     Cabinet approval to the following New Constructioni Cabinet 4   Programme for inclusion in the Navy Estimates for 1933:-( 32) . C on- .elusion 3.) 1 Cruiser (LEANDER Class)fX. 3 small Cruisers (ARETHUSA Class)9(^P- 1 Leader and 8 Destroyers3 Submarines (one Minelayer Submarine and&amp;(j&amp;)7, two &quot;Sn or Patrol type)3 Sloops (one General Service type,one Sloop Minesweeper,one Convoy Sloop)1 Special Service Vessel3 small Vessels (namely, one Coastal Sloop,one Boom Defence Vessel andone Sailing Barque) .Attached to the Memorandum was a financial statement showing the total estimated cost of the programme andthe manner in which the expenditure would normally bespread over the years of building.The First Lord of the Admiralty gave the cabinet an account of a conversation he had had with Mr Bruce,,the Resident Minister in London for the AustralianCommonwealth.   Mr Bruce, of course, had not been ableto commit the Australian Government, but the conversa-tion opened up the possibility of some satisfactory arrangement for the replacement of the &quot;BRISBANE&quot; and,in due course, of other Australian Cruisers.   The matter,however, must be kept strictly secret and regarded asentirely tentative at the present stage.The Cabinet approved the programme ofNaval Construction as set forth in cp.-444 (32) .
WATERLOO 9. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theBRIDGE. Minister of Transport (C.P.-2 (35))  on the subject of(RefIrence:    Waterloo Bridge,  in which he stated that, in view of the(slf^Con-   attitude of Parliament and of the circumstances of the case,elusion 9.) ^ thougnt the time had now come to intimate to the London^ &quot;        County Council that the Government have come to the conclu-si0n that the Bridge should be re-conditioned.   The reportof the Engineers retained by the London County Councilshowed that the existing bridge could be re-conditioned ata cost estimated at  685,000, including the cost of corbel-ling out the bridge so as to provide for four lines oftraffic.   He therefore annexed to his Memorandum, for theinformation of his colleagues, a copy of a letter he proposed to send to the Council.   The Minister furtherstated that the Treasury had agreed that a grant of 60per cent, should be made to the approved cost of re-conditioning the bridge on the lines proposed.It was suggested that the Government ought to assurethemselves that the bridge would not be rendered too unsight-ly by the corbelling process;    that particulars should beobtained;    and that the Government should, if necessary,use their influence with the London County Council toensure that the appearance of the bridge was not spoiled.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the proposal of the Minister ofTransport as set forth in C.P.-3 (33) and summarised above:(b) That the Minister of Transport should ascertain what Architect is to undertake thecorbelling and obtain particulars as to theappearance of the bridge after the corbellingprocess has been completed:(c) That the following alteration should be madeU ln the suggested draft letter to the Clerk of^                                   the London County Council attached to0.P.-8.(33), viz.:-Page 8. lines 15 ajgdjus to be amended to read as follows:-&quot;that there is no alternative but to proceed to re-conditionthe existing bridge&quot;, etc.-13-
