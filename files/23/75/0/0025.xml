JO-operative societies.Proposed,Paxati on if.eg11(previous reference:Cabinet 241(33), Con-clusion 1. )F.R.1.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed theCabinet that, in accordance with the undertaking hehad given at the Meeting referred to in the margin,he had carried out some investigations with a viewto finding an agreed solution of the difficultyarising out of the Report on the Taxation of Co-operative Societies.    The proposal which he himself had made for finding some system whereby the Co-operative Societies could compound their taxationhad been found to present insuperable difficultiesowing to the large number of these Societies.     Hehad then turned to the proposal that had been madeto cut out all exemption except under Schedule D andto confine taxation under Schedule D to trading profitswith non-members.    The difficulty here was that ifSection 39 (4) of the Income Tax Act, 1918, wererepealed, a position might be reached where the Co-oi^era-tive Societies could deduct the tax from the interestthey paid to members, with the result that the exchequer would receive less than they did today.    He then made the following suggestion:-To approach the Co-operative societies and suggest to them an agreed solution,which, of course, could only bind thepresent Government and the present parliament.     The solution he proposed was to undertake not to attempt total profits arising out of trade with the Societies&apos;members,   or to challenge the principleof mutuality in the Courts, but to tax theremainder of the items marked as exempt inthe table in paragraph 13 of the RaeburnReport.     The Societies on their side, toagree not to deduct the tax from payments to members.If this arrangement were refused by thaCo-operative Societies he would proposeto repeal Section 39 (4) reserving theright to challenge the principle of mutualityin the Courts.     So long as the Societies
did not deduct the tax from the paymentof interest or dividends on share capitalthis was estimated to produce about fr&apos;00,000 p. a. for the exchequer.    If,however, tax were deducted that would bring about a situation in which further action would certainly be required butit might be some time before it became necessary.The Secretary of State for War suggested thatthe Chancellor of the Exchequer should also agree,for the lifetime of this Government, not to introduce legislation to enable the profits of members to betaxed.The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained thatthis was his intention.In the course of the discussion it was pointedout that the Chancellor of the Exchequers proposalinvolved the repeal of Section 39 (4) of the IncomeTax Act, 1918.      It was clear, however, from paragraph of the Report of the Committee that even after theremoval of this Section, according to one view ofthe Income Tax law as interpreted by the Courts, aSociety might still be liable to Income Tax inrespect of a surplus arising from transactions withits own members.      The question would then be asked,after the statutory exemption had been removed, asto what right the Government had to release these particular interests from taxation?     It was suggestedthat an alternative method of dealing with the question might be not to repeal Section 39 (4) of theIncome Tax Act, 1918, but to amend it in such a way that the fundamental protection would not be removed.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that that proposal went rather further than he had intended,but would provide an additional protection to the societies.
The Cabinet agreed(a) That the Chancellor of the exchequer should be authorised to approach theCo-operative Societies and suggest to-them an agreed solution, which, ofcourse, could only bind the present government and the present Parliament.The   solution he proposed was toundertake not to attempt to taxprofits arising out of trade withthe Societiest members, or to challengethe principle of mutuality in the Courts,but to tax the remainder of the itemsmarked as exempt in the table inparagraph 13 of the Raeburn Report.The Societies on their side, to agreenot to deduct the tax from payments to members;(Ts) That,instead of repealing Section 39(4) of the Income Tax Act, 1918, Itshould be amended in such a way thatthe fundamental protection to the societies against taxation of members&apos;profits should not be removed:(c) That the Chancellor of the exchequer should formulate his proposal inwriting and communicate it to theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs,who wished to have an opportunity to study the precise effect of the pro-posal before finally assenting to it:(d) That if the offer made to the Societieswere not accepted by them, the Chancellorof the Exchequer should be authorisedto include a clause in the Finance Billrepealing Section 39 (4) of the IncomeTax Act, 1918.

Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,April 7, 19 33.The Cabinet began the discussion on the abovedocuments, but time did not permit of its completion.The Prime Minister made a special appeal to theCabinet to exercise the utmost reticence on the subjectof this discussion.A summary of the discussion is attached, by specialrequest, in the Appendix.The Cabinet agreed  To resume the discussion onMonday, April 10th, at 10-30a .m,
APPENDIX. &apos;Summary of discussion on Unemployment Insurance at theCabinet on Friday,  7th April,  1933.THE PRIME MINISTER said he had read the papers,hut he thought it would be useful if the Cabinet were to hear both points of view stated.MR.CHAMBERLAIN said that the question before theCabinet was really a political matter.    The Cabinet had asked their Committee to take back their originalrecommendations and ^e-^4ns4?4^r them in the light of cabinet discussions.    The Cabinet Committee had understood that theCabinet sympathised generally with their proposals and hoped to be able to give their assent.    The Committee had sincehad a number of meetings at which the Minister of Labour,who from the first had disliked the scheme,  offered detailedcriticisms.    All these criticisms had been carefully considered and appreciated by the Committee.    It was recognisedthat all these points had either to be met or controverted,and in many cases the original proposals had been amended.The outline of the scheme now before the Cabinet     was believed by the Committee to be one that could be worked.on points of detail the Minister of Labour, while making criticisms7, had neverleft the Committee under much doubt as to his maintenanceof his original objections in principle.    He himself didnot complain if his colleague challenggd the scheme, buttime was getting on,  the year was advancing,  a good deal oftime had been spent on the scheme and to reject  it now wouldnot only result in all this effort having been wasted, but would bring the Cabinet back to their starting point.At the bottom of the difficulties of the Ministerof Labour was the fact that he could not bring himself toagree to any scheme that did not put the    class of person who
was at present receiving transitional payment into aprivileged position. He considered it fundamentalthat this class should he  differentiate^ from the Poor LawGlass . ,    He desired to draw a distinction betweennowthose who were/receiving Poor Law treatment and those enjoyingunemployment benefit and transitional payments.The Chancellor thought ho could show that therewas no such hard and fast line drawn in the Committee1sproposal.    It was possible to treat differently those whowere&apos; insickness or ill-health and the aged and infirm, butfor other categories there should be no difference in treatment.    He did not think it would be much use for himto enter into details of the document in a general statementbut he must make some reference to a point raised by theSecretary of State for War when the question was last beforethe Cabinet.    The Secretary of State had suggested that thefirst seven clauses of the Bill were an entirely new proposal.As a matter of fact, they were merely a re-statement of theposition which had to be met owing to the repeal of the poor Law in Article 1.The new proposals started in Article 8 which dealtwith the establishment of a Commission followed by Article9 which defined its powers and duties.    To the Chancellorof the Exchequers mind the prospects of the schemedepended upon the Government&apos;s ability to present it tothe public as the Committee had conceived it; that is tosay, as an Intention to    bring the treatment of theinto line withable-bodied unemployed ^.        modern conditions.      Theywould have to say that these included many people who wereunemployed through no fault of their own, because therewas not enough work to go round.    Further, that this was a semi-permanent problem.      The Committee had sought to
draw a distinction between those who would come under the administration of the Commission and those under the Minister of Labour.    The duty of theMinister of Labour would be to try and find workfor the unemployed and to teach them new trades.The duty of the Commission would be not to try and give men a specialist training for specific trades,but rather to undertake their general treatment  inorder to render them fit to work.    Thus    inArticle 9 (1)   (a)   one of the duties of theCommission was  &apos;to maintain and improve theirphysical and mental condition with a view to fittingthem for entry into or return to employment and forthat purpose to provide opportunities for occupation and recreation&apos;.    He thought it essentialthat that aspect of the scheme should be given greatprominence.    The Minister of Labour appeared to fear either that there would, be a greater expenditurethan we could afford or that undue hopes would bearoused among the unemployed.    Those criticisms werenot without substance, but so long as theGovernment had in mind the financial limits withinwhich they were prepared to act, he was notapprehensive.    He agreed, however,  that too much money must not be spent on these services.    TheCommission would work through voluntary organisations,and he thought there was no reason why it shouldcost too much.
Turning to Article 10, dealing with the Regula-tions, the Chancellor drew attention to the following:-&quot;(e) Right of appeal on the part of an applicant for assistance againstthe decision of an Officer&quot;of theCommission to a superior Officer&quot;.He understood that the Minister of Labour had made ato some outside bodycriticism that unless there was an appeal/a dangerous situation would be created.   He regarded the situationnow as not open to objection, because an&apos;appeal to an outside tribunal had been provided for in cases ofbreach of Regulation., The new proposals would bring an improvement.AInstead of having different bodies all over the countrysubject only to very vague instructions, the commission would be much more tightly bound.   The Commission^Regulations would have to pass first       the Ministerand then *    Parliament.   The Regulations would provideguidance for almost every kind of case.   His point,then, was that if the scheme went through Parliament,Regulations would be laid down for the guidance of theCommission, but nevertheless it would still leave somediscretion to the Officers of the Commission as to how the Regulations should be interpreted and administered.Two questions, however, might arise:-(l) Had the Commission complied with theRegulations laid down for them?and(2) Had. they misused the discretion leftto them in the administration of theRegulations?Taking (2) first, if an appeal were allowed to someoutside Tribunal, the decision would be left with a body outside the Commission, which would be bound to weaken it.   Moreover, there would be numbers of tribunials all over the country each giving differentdecisions.   Consequently, so far as (2) was concerned,the -the Committee felt that/appeal should lie \to   the
superior Officers of the Commission,Taking (l), he said that this was a matter whichmight very properly beoutsidereferred to the/Tribunal as provided in Article 21.Turning to Article 11, the Chancellor of theExchequer quoted the following:-&quot;In deciding whether money or investmentsought to be treated as capital assets,the Commission are to have regard totheir source, and in particular to thequestion whether they represent savings on the part of the applicant or of anymember of his family&quot;.That was intended to allow of a distinction betweenmoney accumulated by thrift and money obtained from somewindfall.Turning to Article   12, the Chancellor said that under the present law the Public Assistance Committeehad the power of recovery against &quot;persons liable toin the case of the sick and infirm,maintain&quot;/   They had no such power in the case of theable-bodied.    The Committee had discussed whether .they shotild not take the opportunity to apply power toma*i**fra-an to the able-bodied also.    It had been urgedthat there was no logical reason for a difference betweenassisting the&quot; sick and the able-bodied.  mhe position wasillogical today, so the Committee had thought that itwas best to re-enact the existing law rather than tointroduce a controversial element whichwas not worth while in order to get something of no great val\ie.   For in assessing needs the circumstancesof brothers and sisters in employment and living in the family were taken into account, but there was no powerof recovery.    Consequently the proposal had been abandoned and there was no power to recover in the case of able-bodied, though it existed in the case of persons gettingmedical relief,
Turning to Article 15, Local Authorities&apos;  Contri-butions, the Chancellor said that under the present scheme the Exchequer made a contribution to LocalAuthorities the size of which was affected by theestimate of the number of applicants they expectedfor public assistance.    He saw no reason why, whenthe Local Authorities were relieved of responsibilityfor public assistance, they should get any contribution.The   Minister   of   Labour       thought that the LocalAuthorities would ask for it, and he agreed that theyfrom .  .probably would, but/his experience in the Ministry ofHealth he thought that,while at first they would protest,when it came to the stage of negotiation some reasonableagreement could be reached, though the Local authorities would always make something out of it.   That alsorendered it possible to do something for the distressed areas .Turning to the Minister of Labourrs alternative,the Chancellor said that it was a scheme for administra-tion by a Government Department, applying either toLocal Authorities, if included,or alternatively to be administered through Labour Exchanges.   He summarisedhis objections as follows(l) ^he whole policy could be changed when a new Minister came into office, withoutany legislation.   That was a danger.(2.) There would be two standards for assess-ment in every Government area, namely,the ordinary Poor Law and Out Relief.He believed this would, be an acuteembarrassment to the Minister ofHealth.(3) It would put the matter back into thehands of Local Authorities .(4)  It would put real responsibility intothe hands of Local Tribunals, whowould have no responsibility.(5) mhe Minister of Labour wanted to havea general responsibility for the scheme without responsibility for the individuals.He believed that this was impossible.
(6) It would perpetuate some of the worstevils of the present system.THE. MINISTER OP LABOUR said that this discussionraised a political question of the greatest importance,the reactions of which might be incalculable.   To his great regret he found himself in disagreement withall the members of the Sub-Committee, except possibly the Secretary of State for Scotland, who would explainhis own position,   ^he case had been stated with complete fairness by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
Many of his own detailed criticisms had been met during theCommitteeTs discussions.    Consequently,  it was of thefundamental objection to the scheme and of its probable effecton Parliament that he wished to speak.-   First of all, this was a different scheme fromthe original plan which   .at first sight had made some appealto him personally, that is to say,  until he had gone into thedetails,   ^hat  scheme provided for a statutory independentCommission outside of politics.      He had examined that proposala long time ago, before it had come up at the Cabinet.    Thatwas rather a difficult scheme, because the Cabinet had feltthat it was impossible to carry out a scheme that  did not provide for Ministerial responsibility.    Consequently, this new scheme had emerged from the deliberations of the CabinetCommittee.       He felt certain it would be said that this schemeshowed that the Government treated the question, not as an industrial but as a Poor Law problem.    In other words,  itapplied Poor Law methods, through a Poor Law Commission,  in poor Law language.    He reminded the Cabinet of how inSeptember 1931 the National Government had started the means test and the machinery for operating it.    It had then beendecided that the assessing authority for the means test shouldbe the Public Assistance Committees,    At once it was said thatthe Governments policy was the same as the Poor Law.    He had replied:  &quot;Not at all.    We have, as a matter of fact, secured inthe Order in Council safeguards against this, for example, thereis no payment in kind, no test work, no payment on loan andno institutions.&quot;       Under this Bill, every one of these safeguardshad disappeared.       Test work had been specifically re-enacted.
Turning to the Bill, he said that the first fourpages did not concern this point and were only a re-affirmationof existing legislation.    From page 5 onwards, however, everyprovision would affect some one-and-a-quarter million people and their dependants who, for the first time, would be brought under Poor Law conditions.    For example, he quoted Article 10,(1),  (a):-&quot;Conditions including conditions as to performingwork or undergoing training, which may be attached tothe grant of home assistance.&quot;That he considered as a direct breach of the national governments undertaking that test ?/ork should not be applied.He quoted also Article 32, containing regulations as to thepowers of a Court of Summary Jurisdiction to impose penalties for :-&quot;(a)  Refusing to perform work in an institution.&quot;THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS pointed outthat this referred only to work Tin an institution1.THE MINISTER OF LABOUR said that the institutionswould- be under the jurisdiction of the Commission.MR. CHAMBERLAIN said that the Commission in Article 10,(1),   (a)  referred to grants of home assistance, whereas the penalties in Article 32 referred only to institutions.THE MINISTER OF LABOUR withdrew the criticism ofArticle 32, but said his remarks.were still applicable to article 10,  (1),   (a).      He then referred to Article 25:-&quot;The Commission to make arrangements with each Councilconcerned with regard to the transfer to the Commissionof officers engaged in the Public Assistance work whichis to be transferred to the Commission.&quot;Thus Poor Law personnel would be employed.      He had no doubt thatthis would be regarded as a Bill designed to put a large numberof people under Poor Law conditions.
The Minister of Labour&apos;s next pointreferred to the segregation of those persons in insurance and those who had fallen out&quot; of insurance from the PoorLaw category.    Some years ago he had come to the following conclusions:(1) That a difference must be made between those whowere in insurance and those who were not, that is tosay, those who had been entitled to benefit should be ina different position from the others.He adhered to this and his own draft Bill provided forsuch segregation:(2)  Pour years ago he had formed the view shared byMr.Davidson,  a prominent writer on this subject, It hatresponsibility for the intermediate class should be handed over to the Poor Law Authorities.He had changed his view in this respect.    Pour years agothere had only been about one hundred thousand persons affected, many of whom were suitable for Poor Law xxxiEfxtreatment.    The problem had now completely changed owingto the fact that there were one and a quarter millionpersons in the intermediate categories.    These were not all out of work all the time.    He thought it was wrongthat persons who were in and out  of work in this wayshould be segregated from those who were in insurance.The moment they were segregated people would think theywere being graded and put into different categories. Hequoted a recent instance at Glasgow where it had been proposed, as a matter of convenience, to make the payments to the intermediate class on a different day from thepayments to insured persons.    At once the impression ofsegregation had got abroad. . There had been an outcry
and it had been necessary to abandon the plan.    He was certain that anything of this hind would create astrong and critical public opinion.The Minister of Labour then replied one&apos; one ortwo of the points mentioned by the Chancellor of theExchequer.    He agreed that it was impossible to confine the plan to those who were now drawing transit ionaibpayment.    He quoted the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs who at a previous meeting had said that therewere one hundred thousand railway men out of work whowere neither in railway insurance nor in Governmentinsurance, and whose only source of relief was the PoorLaw.    He agreed that that position was indefensible.He thought therefore that they should include in thescheme all those who had a reasonable prospect of gettingemployment.    The question whether such men fell wkfewithin the scheme was one that ought to be decided bysome local authority.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES asked if therefore the Minister of Labour&apos;s scheme did not include every able-bodied man.THE MINISTER OP LABOUR replied in the affirmative.It would apply to all men who had a reasonable prospectof finding work.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER remarked thatmight leave a great number of men outside.THE MINISTER OF LABOUR said it would apply toall those to whom.the Labour Exchanges might proveof some value in finding work.    He recalled Mr.Chamberlain&apos;s apprehensions of what would happen when anew Government came into office holding different views.
In any event such a Government with a Parliamentary majoritycould do what it liked irrespective of whatever scheme was now adopted.Summing up, he thought it would be a political mistakeof the first magnitude to adopt a scheme which could notbe defended against the criticism that it  savoured of the poor Law.    Referring to the Chancellor of the Exchequer^point that the scheme was intended to re-condition theunemployed, he pointed out that no money was provided and thefirst criticism would be where is the money to come from.If it was thought that money could be obtained bytightening up the existing administration,  as Minister ofLabour he felt sure that this was not the case.    He did notthink that the time of the Committee had been wasted as theirexplorations had given them a greater knowledge of the problemthan ever before.THE SECRET ART OP STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS said hehad attended every meeting of the Committee.    His naturalinclinations were,  of course, towards sympathy with theunemployed and to look carefully at the reactions of the plan.He could say to the Minister of Labour that no Bill that could be produced would not be opposed.    The business of theopposition was to oppose and whatever the plan they would oppose.    He hoped also that  it would not be represented thatthis was a Poor Law Bill.    The very first article of the Billrepealed the Poor Law.      In addition the Bill made provision for the problem of the tramp.    In modern days thetramps included many fine young fellows who took to the road to seek a living and gradually became demoralised.    TheGovernment could not stand asqpxiHH^ by and do nothing for this class.    This was the first occasion on which there had been
an attempt to make provision for them and it was theduty of the State to do what they could for the physical and moral condition of these men.    Was the Cabinetwilling to see Municipal Government break down? Thatwas a danger that arose under the Public assistance committee system.    People would not enter MunicipalGovernment owing to what they were subjected to inconnection with these Committees.      It was essential toget the subject out of that atmosphere.    He was not infavour of taking the question out of the- jurisdiction ofParliament,    He gathered that the Minister of Labourobjected on the ground that it segregated the transitionalclass from the insured class.    He must know that it wasno use today to go to the House of Commons and say thatwe must go on without a self-supporting scheme.    TheMinister of Labour wanted to create three classes andnot two.    The Committee provided for looking after the physical and moral well-being of these men.    He believedthat instead of being hailed as a Poor Law scheme,public opinion would regard it as a great effort.    he agreed that much depended upon the presentation of thescheme which abolished the Poor Law and dealt withthe question in the only possible way.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR SCOTLAND said hehad understood that the Committee&apos;s intention was first to draw up a scheme for England before attempting toprovide one for Scotland.    He did not want to take theadministration of the Poor Law in Scotland away from the poor Law Authorities as the present scheme worked quitewell, but he wanted the men coming out of insurance to bein a separate category under the Minister of Labour,who had the special machinery, acting throughba statutory commission;  individuals should have the right of appeal toa body representing relatively large areas.13.
Committee had always said that when a scheme had been drawn for England, the Scottish problem would be tackled,but not necessarily on the same lines.     He saw noinsuperable objection to Scotland being dealt with on different lines from England.THE MINISTER OP HEALTH saw nothing irreconcilablein the proposals of the Secretary of State for Scotlandand those of the Committee,   Historically^ &apos;the positionof Scotland had always been different in Poor Law matters.On the main problem, he had v-ese-y little to add to whatthe Chancellor of the Exchequer had said.    The vital point was whether the scheme was or was not a Poor Law scheme,or could be described as such.    Against this he pointedout that it had been framed so that the first provisionof it was a repeal of the Poor Lav/ Act.    It was, in fact,a final stage in the break up of the Poor Law.   Under thisfLJ- Ju^r ij Itcscheme the Poor Lav/ would disappear, as well as^t^eorganisation^ that^administered it.    The first part ofthe Bill w&amp;s--a&amp;&amp;&amp;i$^-3*-J2&amp;^^ but it had a. very important bearing on the main question, because its$ffi^^ye^fVo^^^^jlwb- all the-s-e-p-evre-ps- v;ould now be administered,W^   not fe^  the Poor Law, but/Jay- -the -med-Pe-atb-relief machinery.Next came the administration by a Commission.      There was really no resemblance between this and Poor Lawadministration, and it must be plain to anyone that anew machinery was being created which ;&quot;as not subject toPoor Law methodo.    First of all,  an entirely new body wasto be set up,  and the Public Assistance Committees were togo.       There would be a new body with new methods, which-14-
7/hich would &quot;be looked at in a new light as a body of trustees for TJ^emg^JgO^aenfc.....-Ino^igano-e .     54? would depend upon the personnel of the Commission, but he felt sure that they would be looked on by the public with- a newThe assigning   to them of welfare work was most important in this respect.    They would have the active duty of tending the physical and mental y/elfare/tv 1/C islets   j *-nttrtX-A-A^   uAfk.   lA&apos;of the unemployed.

He gathered that the Minister of Labourattached importance to certain safeguards instituted by the National Government in g.e-p.teei?b-e*--4J9^e.     As, tothe question of payments in cash and not in kind, thiswas a matter of no great importance/a^--e4^5J3ms4^H&amp;o-sfoad- cfoaaged.       Payment in kind was e-sigr contemplated asa matter of convenience to the administration.     As to test work, in the new atmosphere .this was merely acondition that, for his own good, the recipientof assistance ought to do some kind of work or *^e-&amp;*ie-atiaa.The regulations in this respect would be subject tothe approval of the Minister..   As regards payments on loan, no such payments were no?; contemplated. aaaeU-tee%4tei*gterb-t-frere was a misunderstanding.

It would be a great pity to separate thatclass from the responsibility of the Commission.Gradually, therefore,  as the enquiry proceeded, ho had formed the impression that any attempt to representthe scheme as a Poor Law scheme would fail.    If hehad had to put forward a scheme it would have beena different one, but he doubted if it would have beenadopted.   He now thought that this was the only feasiblescheme.

THE MINISTER OP AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES saidthat- all the Ministers who had spoken up to now had had the advantage of studying the subject as membersof the Committee.   mhe Cabinet were bound to be influenced by their examination, and especially bythe fact that they had reduced their scheme to the formof heads for a Bill.    He thought there was certainly avery strong case for a Commission, as well as a very strong case for moving the frontier of administrationbetween the Poor Law class and Insurance, so as toinclude a larger number in the middle field.   Thedifficulty was in settling where the line was to bedrawn.    But why, he asked, was the scheme placed underthe Minister of Health?   The proposal would go far to abolish the functions of the Minister of Labour, whowould have far        fewer people to administer than inthe past.   The work would fall to the already over-burdened shoulders of the Minister of Health, on whom would fall the responsibility for organising this greatenterprise.    Pie did not believe that the needs ofScotland were so very different.   Take, for instance,the case of one man working on the Midland and ScottishRailway in Glasgow and another working on the same line in Newcastle.    They apparently would be dealt with onquite different lines.    In the same way, an agriculturallabourer would be, so to speak, the subject of theMinister of Labour in Scotland and of the Minister ofHealth in England.   There was also the objection of aPoor Law atmosphere.   He agreed with the Secretary ofState, for Dominion Affairs in considering this a remedialmeasure.    He thought, however, it was very important to law down under which colours the scheme was to sail.His own inclination was that it should pass under theMinistry of Labour, under whom. it. would be possible to
secure trie right atmosphere.   If it were placed tinderthe Ministry of Health, where it would be dealt with bythe same officials as dealt with the Public AssistanceCommittees, who would refer to the Officers of PublicAssistance Committees in localities, the scheme couldnot escape the criticism that it was associated withthe Poor Law.   As a minor point also, the areas of theMinistry of Labour were much more convenient for dealingwith this mobile class of labour.    Por administrativereasons he preferred the scheme should be under theMinistry of labour, but for psychological reasons he considered, this essential.   This view, he pointed out,was reinforced by the views of the Secretary of Statefor Scotland in favour of using the Ministry of labour for that country.THE MINISTER OP HEALTH pointed out that the Reportof the Sub-Committee did not say to which particularMinistry the scheme was to be attached.    That could besettled later.THE MINISTER OP LABOUR said in his view theappropriate Ministry was the Ministry of Health, forthe reason that in his opinion the scheme could only beregarded as a Poor Lav; scheme.    He admitted that therewere advantages in taking the matter out of the hands ofLocal Authorities, but in dealing with instructions, etc.,he thought the Ministry of Health was the right Department.The Cabinet then adjourned, untilMonday, April 10th, at 10-30 a .m.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,April 7, 1933,
