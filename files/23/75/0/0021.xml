The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs gave the Cabinet an account of a telephone conversa-tion he had held that afternoon with Sir E. Ovey, at moscow (Appendix) .    Owing to the certainty of the conversation being &quot;tapped&quot; he had not been able toascertain by direct question and answer the Ambassador^opinion as to the probable effect of the proposals before the Cabinet for taking powers to prohibitimports from Soviet Russia after the expiration ofthe existing Trade Agreement on April 17th.   Aninconvenient episode had been a telephone messagesent by Reuters Agency in London to their representa-tive in Moscow indicating that public interest inEngland was waning on this subject and suggestingshorter reports ,   This had been corrected, after   ,the personal intervention of the Secretary of State,by a later instruction, but the incident might havedone some harm.On reflection, the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs was opposed to any withdrawal or threat of withdrawl of the Ambassador at the present stage.This step would involve the absence of the Ambassadorwhen he was most needed at Moscow;    it would be ineffective;    and it would provide an inconvenientprecedent, which might be followed by other nationsom insufficient groundsi and the Government might be pressed to follow it in the ease of disputes withother nations, where it was less applicable.   this measure should be kept in reserve for possible laterapplication, for example, if and when the prisoners in Moscow were given a farcical trial and condemned.The proposal to obtain powers for use after April 17thwas in a different category .   The fact of asking forpowers should bring home to the Soviet Government the
seriousness o.f the position.    Sir E. Ovey had already informed M * Litvinoff that this step was in mindhut had not been announced publicly solely becauseat that moment the release of the prisoners had appeared possible.   He advised, therefore, that parliamentary Counsel should be asked to draft thenecessary legislation.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs addedthat his advisers took the view that if the SovietGovernment had decided to convict and punish the prisoners nothing would atop them.   M. Litvinoff had made clear to Sir E. Ovey that if the choice laybetween the Soviet&apos;s right to apply their own laws to foreigners and the Trade Agreement they must choose the former.   If, however, the Soviet was wavering,which seemed possible from their present silence,the Foreign Office thought that anything in the natureof a threat might tend to harden their attitude.Hence he advised that there should be a day or two&apos;sdelay, but that if within the next few days therewas no sign of a more accommodating attitude, anannouncement should be made of the Government&apos;intention to take the proposed powers for appliea-tion, if necessary and desirable, after April 17th.The Cabinet accepted the Foreign Secretary&apos;view, but it was suggested that advantage should betaken of the interval not only to prepare a draftBill, as advised by the Secretary of State, but alsoto ascertain by cipher telegram the Ambassador&apos;views of what the Cabinet had in mind.The President of the Board&apos;of Trade pointed outthat there were alternative methods of gaining thesame object without legislation:    e.g., by a
prohibitive tariff on goods of Russian origin.   Itwas suggested, however, that at the present stage a threat to take powers might be more effective inRus s ia.Another suggestion was that an immediate effecton Soviet Russia might be produced by the inclusion in the Prime minister&apos;s forthcoming statement ofParliamentary business next week of an announcement that it might be necessary to take time for thepassage of a Bill conferring powers for use, ifnecessary, after April 17th.   An objection to thisproposal was that it might result in divertingattention in the forthcoming Debate on Foreign Policyfrom the Prime Minister&apos;s and Foreign Secretary&apos;recent negotiations to Russia.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should telegraphat once to Sir E. Ovey and inform him that the proposal to withdraw the Ambassadors from their respectiveCapitals did not commend itself tothe Cabinet at the present stage,for the reasons given above, though this step might be reserved for alater stage .   At the same time heshould invite the Ambassador&apos;opinion as to the proposal favoured by the Cabinet, viz., to announce that powers would be taken to prohibit imports from Soviet Russiaafter the expiration of the presentTrade Agreement on April 17th:(b) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should instructParliamentary Counsel to draft a Bill to implement the latterproposal:(c) That the President of the Boardof Trade, in consultation with theTreasury, should examine thepossibility of accomplishing thesame object without legislation:(d) That the following members of theCabinet -The Prime Minister,The Lord President of the Council,The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs -
in consultation as necessary withany other Ministers concerned,should he given full powers onbehalf of the Cabinet to takethe necessary steps to giveeffect to the policy indicated above, to such extent as theymight deem advisable, after thereceipt of Sir E. 0vey&apos;s replyto the above telegram:(e) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should inform theSecretary of State for War, as leader of the House of Lords, ofthe nature of any statement he proposed to make in the House ofCommons on this subject.
TANGANYIKA.The Mandate(previous reference:Cabinet 15(32), Con-elusion 12.)2. The Secretary of State for the colonies informed the Cabinet that, in reply to a Parlia-mentary Question as to whether further consideration would be given to the question of- surrendering ourin TanganyikaMandate^ he proposed to reply that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have never contemplated any surrender of the Mandate .The Cabinet approved this reply.
3,    The Home Secretary invited the Cabinet&apos;attention to a Memorandum he had circulated on thesubject of the Police (C.P.-60 (33)) and asked fora Special Meeting of the Cabinet for its discussion.The Prime Minister invited theHome Secretary to confer v/ithhim on the subject.*  *  *2, Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.1,March 22, 1933.THE POLICE.f previous reference:Cabinet 20(33), Con-clusion 2.)
APPENDIX.SUMMARY OF A TELEPHONE CONVERSATION BETWEENTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs and HIS MAJESTY^AMBASSADOR AT MOSCOW ON&apos;THE AFTERNOON OF MARCH 22nd,  1955, ASCOMMUNICATED VERBALLY TO THE CABINET BY THESECRETARY OP STATE.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that both he and the Ambassador had in mind the possibilityof their conversation being overheard.-       &apos;   The ambassador had told him, as an example, of how little the SovietGovernment realised the feeling in the United Kingdom;that the Moscow Press Department was putting about theinformation that the Ambassador himself was %n a. hystericalcondition and did not represent correctly what they felt in London.      The Secretary of State had replied to thisfirmly and clearly that the Ambassador had said and donewhat he had been instructed to say and do.     The Ambassadorreplied that this would strengthen his position.     TheSecretary of State mentioned,as a possibility, that theGovernment might be asking Parliament for powers to stopimports from Russia after April 17th, and had asked himto think it over.     He had explained that for technical reasons this could not be announced for a day or two.Sir E. Ovey had no further news to communicate.     Hehad, however, received a copy of a letter which stalin had written in regard to an enquiry from the american ambassador as to the position of American engineers inRussia.     This reply had been of a re-assuring character as to their safety and freedom from arrest.      The Secretaryof State read part of the letter to the Cabinet.The Secretary of State then mentioned the incident of instructions to neuter&apos;s Agencies, which is referred toin the Cabinet Minutes.
