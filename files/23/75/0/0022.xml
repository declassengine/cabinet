lousfterenoe:IB,met *jiolusxon1.  The Cabinet had before them a Most secret memorandum by the Home Secretary (G.P.-60 (33))circulating for their consideration certain proposals submitted by Lord Trenchard for the reform of theMetropolitan Police Force, directed partly to changesin administration and partly to changes of organisa-tion.   The Home Secretary trusted that the cabinet would decide in favour of these reforms, and at theend of his Memorandum described the course of events which would make it possible for an announcement ofthe schemes for the reform of the Metropolitan police to be made shortly after the Easter Recess.The Prime Minister expressed his regret that ithad not been possible to arrange for a Meeting ofthe Cabinet to take this item on the previous after-noon or evening.The Home Secretary made a statement in explanation of the proposals.The principal doubts expressed as to the proposals were, - that the Police Force has a very highreputation with the general public;    that in thesecircumstances it would be difficult to convinceParliament of the need for such drastic reforms atthe present time, the more so as a good deal of discretion would have to be observed by the government speakers:    that the nature of the scheme lent itselfto misrepresentation;&apos; for example, it would be statedthat it involved militarisation of the Police Forceand the reservation of the best posts for a privilegedclass.    In particular, it was urged that in anypublished report such phrases as the &quot;educated class&quot;or &quot;officer class&quot; should be avoided, although therewas no objection to an indication that it was desirableto introduce graduates of a University into thePolice Force . ..,V
The Cabinet were informed that the Commissioner ofthe Metropolitan Police was about to submit hisAnnu.al Report to the Home Secretary, whose present intention was to print and circulate it on the Thursdaybefore the House of Commons rose.   During the RecessMembers would have an opportunity to study the Report,in which attention would be drawn to certain of the defects mentioned in the Papers before the Cabinet.The Press also, no doubt, would give the matter agood deal of publicity, and the Home Secretary would see the appropriate Parliamentary Committee as soonas the House met.   Public opinion having thus beenenlightened, the necessary legislation would be intro-duced.    ^his programme, however, did not altogethercommend itself to the Cabinet.    It was suggested thatit might be better if the Home Secretary publishedthe Report by the Commissioner of Police after thePaster Recess, when members of the Government were in personal contact with the House of Commons .    shortly after the publication of the Report a day could begiven to Debate, when the Home Secretary would havean opportunity still further to enlighten publicopinion and thus to avoid misrepresentations .In this connection the Home Secretary informed the Cabinet that his general idea was to impress onthe House of Commons that the new forms of crime that had recently appeared required new methods for theirdetection and prevention;    that at present there wasno General Staff and no prompt Information Service atScotland Yard, and that this necessitated personnel of a higher standard of education than at present.At a later stage of his speech he would call attentionto some of the factors mentioned in the Commissioner&apos;sReport which militated against discipline.
The Cabinet were reminded that the reform of theMetropolitan Police Force would be a task of greatdifficulty for an ordinary Party Government.    If itwere not undertaken by the National Government itmight be delayed indefinitely.   The post of commissioner of Police was occupied by a man of outstanding qualities,and, with his Report before them, the National Governmentcould not afford to neglect the question of reform.There was very general agreement that public opinion would have to be instructed very carefully as to the need of new methods.   It wassuggested, for example, that it might not be necessaryto disclose all the details of the scheme at once.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve generally the proposals submitted by the Home Secretary in cp .-60 (33):(b) That a Cabinet Committee, composed as follows -The Lord President of the Council,The Secretary of State for War,The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs -should be appointed to consult withthe Home Secretary on the publicationof the Annual Report of the commissioner of the Metropolitan Police.
RUSSIA.inglo-SovIetdelations .lowest ofBritishSubjects .Draft RussianGoods (Import-Prohibition)Bill.ffossibleEffects uponIfnited Kingdom-interests .(previous reference:fabinet 21.(33), Con-idusion 1 &amp;Appendix .)FLU.2. The Cabinet had before them the following memoranda by the President of the Board of ^rade:-C.P.-85 (33), covering the draftRussian Goods (import Prohibition)BilliC ,P .-86 (33), covering a memorandum prepared in the Board of Trade show-ing the possible effects upon UnitedKingdom interests of the prohibitionof Russian imports.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairscommunicated to the Cabinet the information containedin the latest telegrams from Moscow,   When Sir E, Oveyhad attempted to inform M. Litvinoff that a Bill hadbeen drafted and would be disctissed by the Cabinetnext day, M, Litvinoff had stated that he was not inthe slightest degree interested in what happened atthe British Cabinet and had intimated that he did not wish to hear any more.   The Ambassador, however, had succeeded in stating that these powers would be takenunless he was in a position to tell His Majesty&apos;sGovernment before the Gabinet Meeting that the trial of the British prisoners would not take place.M. Litvinoff had refused to listen to the terms ofthe Bill.    Only at a later stage of the conversationhad the Ambassador beenable to refer to the announce-ment which it was proposed to make in Parliament onMarch 30th.    Other information indicated the probability that a trial would take place.On the whole, the Cabinet inclined to the viewthat the announcement of the Bill was not likely to deter the Russian Soviet Government from proceeding with the trial.    On the other hand, they had to take into account that the Ambassador had notifiedM, Litvinoff of the&apos; intention to introduce a Bill.Not to announce its introduction, therefore, would place the Ambassador in a very embarrassing position.
The Cabinet were not unmindful of the serious effects upon United Kingdom interests of prohibitionof Russian imports, as set forth in C.P.-86 (S3).They realised, however, that the Bill was only anEnabling Bill and that even after it had been enactedthe Government would not be compelled to exercise their powers.    In order to enable them later on, ifnecessary, to resist pressure to do so, it was generally agreed that in the announcement of theGovernment&apos;s intentions it should be indicated thatthe question whether those powers would be exercisedwould depend on the treatment accorded to the british prisoners in Russia.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That on the following day, Thursday,March 30th, the Prime Minister should,give notice of the Government&apos;s inten-tion to pass a Bill before Easterconferring powers for the prohibitionof Russian imports:(b) That the Prime Minister should seethe Parliamentary Secretary to theTreasury with a view to passing theBill in the House of Commons throug hall its stages in a single day:(c) That the Chancellor of the exchequer should confer with the President ofthe Board of Trade as to a proposalhe had in mind, for using the proceeds of licensed imports to recompense the creditors in this country of theRussian Soviet Government.

The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that he had nothing to add to the various reportsof conversations that the Prime Minister and himself had had with foreign representatives during their recent visits to Geneva, Rome and Paris,   He would invite the attention&apos; of his colleagues&apos; in particular to his conversations with Dr. Benes, m. Titulescuand Dr. Potich.
4. The Cabinet again had before them the followingdocument? on the subject of Japanese Competition inthe Textile Trade, which were summarised in theConclusions of the Cabinet held on March 8th (Cabinet15 (33), Conclusion 3):-(previous reference:Cabinet SO(33), Con-elusion 8.The President of the Board of Trade informed theCabinet that the situation had become much more acutesince the subject was last discussed.    A deputation from the Manchester Chamber of Commerce had informed him that they wanted a re-opening of the Treaty position with Japan.    For the immediate present his suggestion was to withdraw the West African and West IndianColonies from the Anglo-Japanese Commercial treaty in order that they might be able to withhold most-favoured-nation treatment in future from Japan..   Thfltwould clear the ground so far as Lancashire was concerned, but competition was now spreading   to a wide range of other goods .    The very low wages paidin Japan, coupled with the low value of the yen,made it impossible for this country to compete.    Theposition had passed beyond that of a sporadic attack by business men on the trade of another country andwas approaching a national movement by Japan to capture the markets of Asia and beyond that continent.    he hoped eventually to arrive at a position where cartelarrangements might be discussed with the Japanese,but this must be preceded by action such as he had proposed.The Secretary of State for the Colonies informed the Cabinet that the West African and West IndianColonies were ready and anxious for the proposed-7-
withdrawal of the Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty,He had received information from a prominentLancashire business man who had discussed thequestion with M. Matsuoka.    ^he latter had said thatthe proper way to handle the question was by meansof a cartel, though he thought the present momentinopportune.The Secretary of State for India read to theCabinet a telegram from the Government of Indiapressing for the immediate denunciation of the Indo-Japanese Commercial Convention of 1904.   He was willing to do his best to arrange that India shouldmarch in step with the United Kingdom Government, but pointed out that the Indian position was really anindependent one and was governed by a differentTreaty .The Prime Minister read to the Cabinet telegramNo. 76, from Tokyo, dated March 13th, which had arrived during his absence abroad with the foreign secretary,   This indicated that denunciation of theTreaty by the West African Colonies alone should notprovoke undue resentment in Japan so long as it was clearly dissociated from anything in the nature of sanctions .    ^he Ambassador did not entirely exclude the possibility of a limited cartel arrangement betveenthe United Kingdom and Japanese cotton interests, and.thought this should be tried.    If denunciation wasdecided on he asked authority to make full and friendly verbal explanations at the Ministry ofForeign Affairs.The Cabinet were reminded that this was the possibleopening of a very serious question, namely, a strugglebetween East and West arising out of the great differ-ence between their respective standards of living.
(a) To approve generally the policy of taking steps, on behalf of theColonies in West Africa and theWest Indies, to withdraw from theAnglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty,in order that they should, be in aposition to withhold most-favoured-nation treatment in future from japan, subject to -(b) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs&apos; suggestion shouldbe adopted that he should see theJapanese Ambassador as soon aspossible and warn him that several of his colleagues (viz., thePresident of the Board of Tradeand the Secretary of State for theColonies) were concerned at the veryserious extent of Japanese commercialcompetition.   He should add alsothat the Government of India hadsimilar preoccupations.      In raising the question he should make clearthat it was totally disconnectedfrom any political issue such asthose that had arisen at geneva and was a purely commercial diffi-culty,   He should indicate generally the course which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment proposed to take, asset forth above in (a):    but shouldpoint out that 12 months would elapse before the withdrawal of certainColonies from the Convention wouldtake effect.    In the circumstances he should invite the Ambassador to visit the President of the Board ofTrade, who would be able to give himall information and discuss the matter in detail.  In addition, he should notify the British Ambassador in ^okyo:fc) That the Secretary of State for india should be authorised to approve therequest of the Government of Indiato denounce the Indo-JapaneseConvention of 19 04, but the cabinet took note that the Secretary ofState for India would not take action until after the conversations referredto above in (b), and that India would keep in step with the United Kingdomso far as the separate nature of theirdifficulty with Japan renderedf eas ible.
IIHI5.      The Cabinet took note that the Secretary ofState for the Colonies, after consultation with theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, had decidedthat the moment was inopportune for carrying out thepolicy approved by the Cabinet at the meeting referredto In the margin.
M 3 S6.      The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for the Colonies (C.P.-81 (33))circulating the Report of Sir Samuel Wilson, thePermanent Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies,on his recent visit to Malaya with a view to discussing with the High Commissioner, the Malay Rulers and theleaders of public opinion the proposals which hadbeen made to decentralise certain public services in the Federated Malay States . The Secretary of Stateagreed with the line of policy advocated by Sir SamuelWilson, and unless he found strong reactions in malaya which might lead him to reconsider this view-he proposed to adopt generally the recommendations in the Report,The Secretary of State for India said he could see no objection from the point of view of India tothe proposals in CP. 81(33), but he warned the Cabinetthat if the proposals had a bad reception in IndiaIt might be necessary for him to make representations to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.The Cabinet approved the proposals of theSecretary of State for the Colonies as setforth in CP. 81(33).

There would be a token vote of  100 whichhe understood would cover the cost.     He asked for authority for the introduction of the Resolution in both Houses of Parliament before Easter.     If this were approved he would communicate with the Parlia-mentary Secretary to the Treasury, and would arrangefor him to inform the Secretary of State for War, as leader of the House of Lords, of what had beenarranged.The Cabinet approved the Prime MInistervsproposal.

Afterreviewing all the circumstances in the light ofthe recommendations contained in the Report of the milk Re-organisation Commission, the Ministerreached the following oonelusion:-&quot;So far as the milk marketing scheme under the 19 31 Agricultural&quot; MarketingAct recommended by the Commission is&quot;concerned, this is following thestatutory procedure.    As regards theestablishment of a dairymen&apos;s boardand a joint council, I ask for authority to announce that theGovernment is not prepared as atpresent advised to introduce furthernew legislation to set up a statutorydistributors&apos;  organisation as recom-mended by the Milk Commission.    Ineffect, however, the intentions ofthe Commission as to consultation between distributors, manufacturers and producers before fixing milkprices, with or without arbitration by persons nominated by the Government,can^ if desired, largely be securedunder legislation already beforeParliament&quot; ,The Cabinet approved the proposal of theMinister of Agriculture and Fisheries,as set forth In CP. 83(33), and quoted above.

The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Transport ^C-,P,-75 (33))  on theextent of the application of Section 116 of theRoad Traffic Act, 1930, relating to compensation.At the Meeting mentioned in the margin the minister had undertaken to consider the possibility of insert-ing a provision in the proposed Bill which wouldhave the effect of imposing upon the Local authority concerned an obligation to pay any of its employeesaffected by agreements entered into under Section 105of the Act the same compensation which any suchemployees would be entitled to obtain from the road fund under Section 116 as it now stands.    It was clear that it was not the intention of Parliament,when the Road Traffic Bill was under consideration,to impose such a liability upon Local Authorities,and the Minister of Transport had come to the conclu-sion that the extension of the scope of the bill would be both ineffective and anomalous .   He therefore asked authority to proceed with the Bill as originally proposed.The Cabinet approved the proposal of the Minister of Transport in cp. 75(33) as summarised above.

The Home Secretary anticipatedthat the &quot;Bill would be supported by the general feeling of the House, and suggested that it shouldbe given a free vote and that the attitvide of theGovernment spokesman should be to express approvalof the principle of the Bill, while making itclea^ that its acceptance by the Government wouldbe conditional on considerable amendment of variousprovisions,The Cabinet were reminded that on the 30thNovember the Prime Minister had suggested that theGovernment should adopt not rigidly but so far as might prove practicable the following procedure indealing with Private Members&apos; Bills:(a) As a general rule, where practicable,Ministers should abstain from makingstatements of Government Policy on.Private Members&apos; Bills:(b) That when Ministers did speak onbehalf of the Government on private members&apos; Bills they must be very careful not to promise facilities.In these circumstances the Home Secretary statedthat he proposed to leave the Bill to the House ofCommons, but that if a speech had to be made onbehalf of the Government it would be on the lines suggested in CP. 77(33), as summarised above.The Cabinet approved this proposal.-19-
