iplOYMENTbang E.n ovserence:inet 25), Con-[ision 2 andbendix .)V-A- a 7,ft..1. The Cabinet resumed their discussion, begun onFriday last, on the subject of Unemployment Insurance,and again had before them the two following documents,which were briefly summarised on page 4 of theConclusions mentioned in the margin, viz.:-The Third Report of the CabinetCommittee (C.P.-89 (S3.)):A Memorandum by the Minister ofLabour  fC,P.-90  (33)).The Minister of Labour referred to the last paragraph of the summary of the discussion onUnemployment Insurance appended to the Conclusionsof the Cabinet Meeting mentioned in the margin, and explained that he had not intended to imply that theonly possible Minister to undertake responsibilityfor those outside insurance should, be the Ministerof Health.   What he did mean was that the proposed bill incorporated many duties which were obviouslyduties of the Minister of Health.He also made a number of observations in reply tothe Chancellor of the Exchequers statement of hisobjections on page 6 of the summary of thediscuss ionat the preceding Meeting.    If the Cabinet wished to convert the Bill into a Ministry of Labour Bill, hewould be willing to take the Bill into his department and make every possible effort to meet the various points that had been raised in the course of thediscussion, within the instructions of the Cabinet;but he regarded the Bill, the heads of which were before the Cabinet, as definitely retrograde.    In thecourse of the discussion he made quite clear that ifthe Bill was to be a Ministry of Labour Bill theMinister must have responsibility for preparing thescheme for consideration by the Cabinet.
6 kDuring the discussion explanations were given to clear up misunderstandings on certain points:    e .g..,the Chancellor of the Exchequer explained that the contribution of the Local Authorities was intended tobe put into a common fund and handed over to theCommission, which would adopt large areas within whichthe fund would be used.The Minister of Health explained that he had contem-plated that the Commission would resort to His Majesty&apos;office  of Works for the purchase or hire of buildings,etc., exactly the same as would any Government Depart-meht.A good deal of the discussion was devoted to thequestion of whether the responsibility for the scheme should rest with the Minister of Health or the Ministerof Labour.    One suggestion was that there might be advantages in amalgamating the Ministry of Health andthe Ministry of Labour into a single Ministry embracingthe field of social service at present covered by thetwo Departments .   This proposal, however, did not receive any support.The Cabinet were informed that the Committee had never discussed the question of which Ministry shouldbe responsible.   mhe main reason why several membersof the Cabinet preferred the Ministry of Labour to theMinistry of Health was in order to avoid Poor Law taint.The Minister of Health said he had considered thisquestion since the last Meeting and was of opinionthat the scheme could be worked under either theMinister of Health or the&apos;Minister of Labour.This question of which should be the responsibleDepartment was stated, to have both political andadministrative aspects .    It was suggested that thedecision turned on whether the problem of the transitional
payment class was regarded as part of our industrialproblem or as part of the problem of relief to poorpeople:    in other words, as to whether the problemof helping these people who wanted work and were capable of work, but for whom work could not be found,was one of industry or assistance.^he Prime Minister pointed out that everyone wasagreed in the desire to abolish the Poor Law,    It was contemplated under the scheme to divide the functionsof the Poor Law between the Local Authorities and theCommission, and, in addition, to deal with the transitional payment class, which lay between the insured class and the casual class .   He was not sure that the Cabinet were clear as to the precise line of demarcation.On this point the Minister of Health explainedthat the Local Authorities would become responsiblefor infirmaries.public hospitals, children&apos;s homes,mental institutions and medical relief in the domicile:that is to say, all kinds of relief of a medical nature,mhe Commission would take responsibility for assistanceto the transitional payment class and all out-relief which was not in the nature of medical relief, andwhich would therefore include outside payments now made under the Poor Law, The Commission would also take over the casual wards,trans itionalIt was suggested that this involved some confusionof function, since the Commission would have toarrange at the same time for payments at present madeby the Poor Law to aged folk who would never workaerain, as1 well as to the able-bodied man who was outof work.
The Minister of Health agreed that the point atwhich the line was to he drawn was fundamental.    In thescheme the frontier was drawn between out-door reliefmedical ^ *u^u,oL out-doorand/institutional relief;    that is to say,/relief whichwas at present Poor Law relief would be transferredmedicalto the Commission, whereas,institutional relief wouldbe transferred to the Local Authorities.   The reasonsfor this were twofold:    first, that the experts of his department were unanimous that any definition of the&quot;able-bodied&quot; was,  for administrative purposes, imprac-ticable:    and, second, that there was no real distinctionin principle between an elderly person receiving assist-ance at the domicile and a young able-bodied man whowas out of work.    Both ought to be treated with thesame consideration.^he Minister of Labour reported that his expertsgave exactly the contrary advice, and the Secretary ofState for Scotland advised the Cabinet that in Scotland a differentiation was in fact regularly practisedbetween the &quot;able-bodied&quot; and persons  &quot;unfit for employment&quot;.At this point the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs summed up the position as follows:-All the Cabinet appeared to be agreed that they didwant an important scheme which would strike the publicimagination and should emphasise that the State was taking in hand more effectively than hitherto the caseof those who want work but cannot find it.    The methodby which that was to be accomplished included the setting up of a Commission and the abolition of theexisting Poor Law.    The practical difficulty was todraw the line as to what functions should be transferredto the Commission and what to the Local Authorities.
He suggested that if the object of the Bill was clearit should not be impossible to discover how the line was to be drawn, and the experts of the Departmentsconcerned might be called in for this purpose.&quot;&quot;he Cabinet agreedThat a Cabinet Committee, composed asfollows -The Chancellor of the Exchequer(in the Chair),The Secretary of State for HomeAffairs,The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs,mhe Secretary of State for Scotland,^he Minister of Health,The Minister of Agriculture andFisheries,0he Minister of Labour,The First Commissioner of Works  should re-examine the scheme submittedto the Cabinet in CP.-89 (33), in thelight of the Cabinet&apos;s discussions,with a view to reaching an agreedscheme.    They should also report asto which Ministry, or Ministries,the responsibility for carrying outthe scheme should be allotted.
LfliPLOYMENTIjJjgORANOE.Note of censure.(previous reference:Cabinet 25(33), Con-elusion 2.)PR,2. The Cabinet had under consideration thefollowing Vote of Censure to be moved on Wednesday,April 12th, in the House of Commons:-&quot;That this House regrets that,instead of making the burdenof unemployment a nationalcharge, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment have driven large numbersof able-bodied unemployed persons to seek the aid of the Poor Law,thereby exhausting the resourcesof an ever-increasing number oflocal authorities&quot;.The Minister of Health pointed out that thedifficulties of the Debate would be very considerableif only a temporising or negative reply were givento the representations on behalf of the distressed areas.   He urged that some form of non-permanentrelief to the seriously distressed areas should be announced pending the completion of the Government&apos;sp e rma n e nt s cheme .This raised the question as to whether some general reference could be made in the Debate to the scheme now under consideration by the Cabinet.The Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s difficulty wasthat once extra grants were given, even though nominallythey were only temporary, they could never be recovered;they would form the starting-point of the negotiationswith Local Authorities in connection with the scheme now in contemplation, instead of being merged intothe scheme.   He thought that possibly some relief-might be given in the most urgent cases by means of are-distribution of block grants.The Minister of Health suggested that any exchequer grant given might be assessed in a temporary mannerpending the adoption of the larger scheme now underconsideration, which in any event could not take effect until next year.    If assistance was to begiven, why should it not be prompt?-6-
Attention was drawn to statements in the Press thatthe Government considered that the cost of relief tothe able-bodied should rest with the Chancellor of theExchequer.    No decision to that effect had been taken.It was suggested that the Minister of Health might be permitted to announce that, in the circumstances of thecountry, the Government were prepared to take the costof relief to able-bodied unemployed on to the Exchequer,but that the Local Authorities would have to recognisethat this meant a readjustment of the block grants.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Minister of Health should reply on behalf of the Governmentto the Vote of Censure:(b) That the Minister of Health andthe Chancellor of the exchequer should discuss the question of announcing some temporary as sist-ance to the most distressed areaspending the permanent scheme onwhich the Cabinet are working:(c) That the Minister of Health should circulate to the Cabinet, beforeWednesday&apos;s Meeting, a briefindication in summary of the linehe proposed to take in the Debate:id) ^hat the question of who shouldwind up the Debate should be leftto the Prime Minister to decide inconsultation with the Lord Presidentof the Council.
RUSSIA.Anglo-Sovietdelations ,III imArrest ofBritish.Subjects ,(previous reference:Cabinet 23(33),  Oon-clusion 2.)3,   The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that there appeared every risk that the Englishmen now under trial in Russia wouldbe convicted and sentenced.    It seemed very desirable,therefore, to let the British public know the mannerin which the evidence had been taken.   After consulta-tion with Mr Strang, our Charge dTAffaires at Moscow,and with his agreement, he had come to the conclusionthat it would be advisable to issue a new White paper which would prepare the public for what was likely tobe the result of the trial.A short discussion took place as to whether astenographic note of the trial should be taken.    Itwas urged that the British public was likely to insist on very full information.   On the other hand, it wassuggested that the evidence of a shorthand-note,giving baldly the trumped-up evidence irrespective of the surrounding circumstances, might be completelymisleading.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat more effective practical information was likelyto be obtained from a note taken by a diplomaticrepresentative.The Cabinet agreed  To approve the suggestion of theSecretary of State&quot;for ForeignAffairs for the issue of a newWhite Paper.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,April 10, 19 33.
