U   INDIA,RnstltutionalReforms .IfPrevi ousI Reference:I Cabinet 10(33), Con-elusion 3.)1.      The Cabinet had before them the following memoranda by the Secretary of State for India onthe subject of Indian Constitutional Reforms:-C.P.-49 (33), circulating for theapproval of his colleagues the draftof the White Paper which the Govern-ment had undertaken to present toParliament, with a view.to its exam-ination by a Joint Select Committee,containing their proposals for IndianConstitutional Reform:C.P.-49A (33), calling attention tocertain points in the above proposals and suggesting alterations following a detailed examination by the CabinetCommittee on India:CP,-59 (33). circulating for theinformation of his colleagues atelegram from the Government ofIndia giving an appreciation ofthe probable reception of the white paper in India.THE SECRETARY OP STAmE FOR INDIA, said that hewould give the Cabinet a picture of what the CabinetCommittee had been trying to do during the last fewHe emphasised that the White Paper was not aEill, but rather a Terms of Reference to the proposedJoint Select Committee.   Necessarily, therefore,there were a certain number of ragged ends, and therewere possibilities of alteration by the SelectCommittee, if found necessary.   The production ofthese proposals was a /remarkable achievement, andhad been one of the most difficult tasks ever attemptedin the way of Constitutional development.   The diffi-culties had been enormous, owing to the complexity of the problem.    He would not like to say that it wasa ^a^iy^^od^scheme, and he thought that if the taskhad been approached with a clean sheet a differentand better plan might have been produced.   That,however, had not been the case,  owing to the commit-ments of various Governments in the past.   He didthink, however, that, given thes commitments and
all the surrounding difficulties, it would be verydifficult for anyone to produce a better scheme.He then turned to some of the difficulties.    Thefirst of these was the fact that we were breaking upa unitary Government.   We were bringing into existencea Federation composed of very incongruous units,including the Native States and the Provinces,Unlike other Federations in the British Empire, wewere not building up from existing elements ,   Anotherfactor   in the complexity of the task was the necessityfor providing safeguards for the tremendous Britishinterests in India today.    That, perhaps, was themain cause of complication.   Yet another difficulty was that the comments of the Government of India hadto be sought on every point that arose, and here thematter was complicated by the differences that/existed*MteUi the Government of India and in-, the Provinces.Those considerations would indicate some of thedifficulties that had had to be faced.The Secretary of State admitted, that the scheme would be open to attacks from two points of view:first, from the Indians, who would say that theConstitution was tied up too much by the safeguards,and, second, by critics here, who would maintain thatthe safeguards were inadequate, while other criticswould say that the whole scheme was too complicatedto work.   However, he could not see how a betterscheme could be produced,The plan covered the whole field, namely, theCentral Government and the Provinces,    Even if theycould, not come into operation q^ritre simultaneously in point of time, nevertheless the more he thought the matter over the more he realised that these, twoaspects were interdependent anS could not be^separated.
Coming to details, the Secretary of State saidthat the scheme was conditional on an All-IndiaFederation,  on which all the proposals depended.It would not come into operation unless a sufficient number of the important Indian States acceded.   Hewas constantly being pressed/to say that if the princes did not come in we should give the same kindof Constitution to British India alone.   He had u^k^Lr-e^bs^d thisAand made it clear that the bringing into effect of the Constitution depended upon theconditions being made effective, that is to say, notless than half the seats available to the Statesbeing filled, and not less than half the populationof the States represented.    That was rather a morerigid stipulation than appeared at first sight,since some of the States were governed by minors,IL .       j .     . /-   -     . ^    iThis test, therefore, was probablyas good a working test as was  likely to be found.This was an aspect of the question that he anticipatedwould be much discussed on the Select Committee.Another safeguard was that the scheme would onlycome into operation after a Proclamation, whichwould become effective only after a Resolution by both Houses of Parliament,At the head of the Government would be theGovernor-General, who would have great powers.   Hewould .be the Constitutional Head^ of the Government ^* &quot; ei?arrtmeTE%s .   The Governor-General-3-
would have complete control of the reserved Depart-ments, namely, Foreign Affairs; m*l Defence/.   Therewould be no divided control of the Army, and theresponsibility of the Governor-General in this matterremained, intact.   Apart from the reserved Departmentsthere was a wide field within which the Governor-General would have special responsibilities, in whichhe was entitled to intervene at his discretion inorder to safeguard certain vital interests;    forexample, in finance, and in the matter of commercialdiscrimination, which were two of the most difficultsubjects .   In both these fields the proposals hadbeen accepted by the Chancellor of the Exchequerand by the President of the Board of Trade, subjectto any remarks which they might like to make.    Forcarrying out his duties the Governor-General had power to issue Ordinances for a? long as he liked,and he also had the power of making Governor-General^Acts   powers which he did not possess today.    Hecould also control the conduct of parliamentary business so as to aid him in his task.   The Governor-General would have the right, when he so desired, to preside at the Cabinet and to get access to anyPapers he required.   He could add charges to theBudget.Referring to the Governor-General&apos;s powersvis-a-vis the Federal Ministers, the Secretary ofState recalled that, though there was much talk ofresponsibility at the centre, in fact the responsi-bility of Ministers  in India would differ considerably from the collective responsibilities of the Cabinethere,   There would be two kinds of Ministers,
0ne-third oome from the States, and it was SkJCrather than to the Legislature that thes.vS4*^s- would look for HWJwaJMiAadjafi their jjaJteaaaAe ,In addition, the G-governor-General would have tosee that minorities were represent ed^ bfio i-Miinao tor^*\nOinlTi,,,,fmOV,.....ran.J,ntr^wir&quot;&quot;-*-f^hnj-n joint nrnnt.fi,   Therewould be two or three Ministers, namely, those concerned   in the reserved Departments, who,though normally sitting with the responsible ministers, would not themselves be responsible tothe Federal Legislature, but, through theGovernor-General, to the Secretary of St ate. andJ^ta*s*^pai*v^l0*^efen,
The Federal Legislature would consist of twoChambers with equal powers.    If they came into collisionprovision was made for a joint session.    It was not a plan he particularly liked, but he could not see a betterin the circumstances.    In connection with the giving of equal powers to the two Chambers it must be remembered  thatthe position was not the same in India as it was here.  one reason was that the Indian States expected to be in a stronger position in the Second Chamber where theirrepresentation was higher,  so that this Chamber would have aspecial responsibility.    That was why the Princes had pressed for equal powers both Chambers. He himself did not see any particular reason for making one Chamber stronger thanthe other.    He thought there was no great risk of a Congressmajority.    The States would have thirty per centrepresentation in the lower and forty per cent in the upper house,  The Moslems would have about thirty per cent in each.That would make  it difficult for Congress to get ase-s^e^aaAfe4*ii--at the Centre,    In addition to that  it had to be rememberedthat&apos; the Hindu vote would be split to some extent.    short of a landslide to the left both in British India and theStates        it would seem/impossible for Gongress to get amajority in the Legislature.    He thought, therefore,  that adequate safeguards had been provided against Congressgetting the upper hand,  a point which had been very muchstressed by the critics to the scheme.    This might happen in some of the Provinces but not at the Centre.Turning to the Franchise,  the Secretary of Staterecalled there had been -&amp;&amp;e&amp; m&amp;&amp;&amp;3 attacks on the government scheme owing to the^extension of the franchise.    The criticshad confused the proposals for the Provinces with those forthe Centre,    The big increase in the franchise had only been6.
in the Provinces.    In the Centre,  though considerable,  itwould he nothing like so great and not at all what the critics alleged.    Most reluctantly he had been driven to avoid indirect election to the^ Centre,    He had foundthat indirect election had no friends in India, whetheramong officials or Hindus or,  especially, Moslems, whothought that they would be beaten by the cleverer Hindusin the event of indirect election.    Ho doubt this subject also would be raised in the Select Committee,    He thoughtit a mistake to suggest that the extension of the franchisewas to our disadvantage.    It brought into the franchisemembers of the agricultural community, labourers,  depressed classes, all of whom were hostile to the domination of theCaste Hindus/;    There had been special criticism of theextension of the franchise to women voters.    He had been anxious to get a substantial number :   of women included as he thought they were a stabilising element from our point of view.    The Government of India, however, and allthe Provinces advised that^the/extension of the franchise to women would not work.    They said that it would involve too great a load on the machine, particularly if it were desiredto include the wives of voters.    This would involve too much enquiry within families to be accepted.    Consequently,it had been found necessary to amend the recommendationsof the Lothian Committee in this respect and the franchisewould only be extended to wives on application.    That againwas a point that would no doubt be discussed by the joint select Committee,Turning to the powers of the Federal Legislature,the Secretary of State said that these were set out at length in the clauses and in Appendix VI,    He emphasised the great changes involved as compared with the presentsituation in India.    At the present time the powers of the.
Federal Legislature pervaded every field of Indian life.It was a unitary system which could do anything anywhere.In devising the present scheme the range of action of theFederal Government and of the Federal Legislature had deliberately been limited to a restricted field.    More powers had been given to the Provinces.    He thought      this was an advantage from our point of view as we substituted for aWe&amp;&amp;&amp;*3&amp; Government that could do harm everywhere ese/whosepphere was strictly limited.There was, of course,  a need for a Tribunal 1rpdecide Federal questions and this need was met by theprovision of a Federal Court.    At the last session of the round Table  Conference the view had eventually prevailed,after much discussion, that the British Government should. appoint the Judges, not so much because the Indians liked us,but because they were so suspicious of one another.    Finally,there was a clause providing that in the event of a &quot;breakdown of the Government the Governor-General could take full powersand revert to the present position.    Such powers had been shown to be useful by what had occurred in recent times inGermany,Referring to the Provinces,  the Secretary of Statedrew attention to the fact that the list included Burma^-andtwo new Provinces, namely Sind and Orissa and did not by  . .name exclude Aden,    So far as Burma was conlTarne^d^ j^js^t$&amp;^e^&amp;ss^Beiwted not because it was thought that Burma wouldnot separate, but simply because the Burmans would not make up their mind.    For the moment^ t&amp;ms&amp; &amp;%k&amp;.,  it was thoughtbetter to let the  question simmer and to leave Burma withinthe scheme.    He thought, however,  that almost inevitably theBurmans would decide to leave the scheme in which event &quot;h^oadjustments would have to be made.    The reference to Burmaat the end of the Introduction was to be moved to a less
prominent position.    Referring to Sind and Orissa, theSecretary of State was satisfied that it was necessary tocreate these new Provinces.    The Moslems regarded thecreation of a Province of Sind as a test case.    It was-true that this would be a deficiency&apos; Province, but thatwould be the case of Bombay if Sind were left withirj that province,    Orissa was inhabited by people of a differentrace and would also have to be a. separate Province.Aden, the Cabinet would recall,was to be separated from India by a recent decision.    The question       how ite-e**id be dealt with in the White Paper was only a matter of tactics.    There had been an undertaking that before Adenwas separated from India there should be a discussion in theAssembly and this had not yet taken place. Consequently,  itwas not proposed to say more than that the question of Adenwas under consideration.    There was not the smallestintention of going back on the decision of the Cabinet.The position of Governors of Provinces was similar&apos;in the scheme to that of the Governor-General; that is tosay, they were being given very extended powers that theydid not now possess;  e.g. for:   making Ordinances andGovernor&apos;s Acts.Reverting to the question of law and order,  it hadbeen decided after much discussion that these should beProvincial and not Central Government subjects.    The latter had been desired by the Hindus, but was strongly objected to by the Moslems.    He himself had supported the latter sothat law and order had become a Provincial subject. Promthis decision two difficult questions emerged;  one was   that it assumed the- transfer of law and order to ministers.    He had nothing to add  in this respect to the9.
$ asai considered recommendation of the SimonCommission which was to the effect that itwould not he possible to have provincial autonomy without giving the Provinceresponsibility for law and order.    To do other-wise would be a contradiction in terms and noProvincial Government would do its work without this responsibility.    The case of the Moslemsalso had been kept  carefully in mind.  Theyespecially desired Provincial autonomy and noMoslem leader would agree - e,g. in the Punjabwhere it was expected the Moslems would run theGovernment very well - to carry on withoutresponsibility for law and order.
Bengal was the     hardesfycase since there was apossibility/        there of a Congress majority.    In that Provinceabout half the legislature would be composed of Moslems,thirty-six per cent,  of Hindus and the Europeans with ;   i-ten per cent, would hold the balance of power.    Consequentlyno ffreatthere was perhaps /risk of a Congress majority, butBa^^l^^aa^e^^jao^e-^ ^^q^^^j^sjs of victimisation of thepolice and that Ministers wS&amp;d make their ^SsSaeS&apos; felton the police in such a way as to destroy its morale.Secondly, there was the question of the C.I.P., which wasthe intelligence organisation of the police service and,more particularly, what was to be done with the secretdossiers and their custody.      No question had been foundmore troublesome than that.       At first the  idea had been to keep the C.I.D.  outside the scheme and te place them under the Defence Department,  so that it would be a reservedsubject.      The trouble was that intelligence enteredessentially into the work of the maintenance of law andorder in the Provinces.      Both Sir John Anderson, theGovernor of Bengal,  and Sir Herbert Emerson, the formerHome Member and now the Governor of the Punjab, held thatthe G.I.D.  organisation could not be divorced from theadministration.    Consequently,  it had been foundnecessary to fall back on an alternative and to give tothe Governor-General and to the Governors powers and responsibility to watch the internal administration of thepolice and to see that no abuses took place.    Powers wouldalso be included enabling them to withhold information at discretion,  even from a particular Minister.      Thisarrangement was not being set forth in detail in the schemebecause it had not been discussed at any recent Round table conference, but the Secretary of State was quite agreed thatit should be inserted and that the powers would have to be- 11 -
covered in the clauses setting out the special instructions to the Governor-General and the Governors.The necessary words will be added as an additionalsub-paragraph to paragraph 47 of the Introduction,and would be as follows:-&quot;All the matters dealt with in this paragraphhave been discussed and reported on by the RoundTable Conference at its Third Session..    Apprehensionwas expressed by some members at the first RoundTable Conference that great danger to the peace andtranquility of a Province might develop if theinternal administration and discipline of the policewere not secured, but this matter was not discussed at the Third Round Table Conference in relation tothe special responsibilities of the Governor.His Majesty&apos;s Government proposa to deal with it byinserting in the Instrument of instructions to theGovernor a direction that he should bear in mind the close connection between his special responsibilityfor peace and tranquility and the internal administration and discipline of the police, theforce upon which he would depend,  in the last resort,for the discharge of the special responsibility.&quot;Franchise was dealt with In full in theAppendix to the White Paper, but it was not a matter by which the Government intended to stand or fall.    Hewould watch with interest the development of this question on the Select Committee.With regard to Second Chambers,    these were provided for in only three Provinces.      In most Provinces,there were not a sufficient number of well-qualifiedrepresentatives available for more than one Chamber,There would, however,,  be two Chambers in Bengal, Behar,and the United Provinces, and in those cases provision was made for a joint session in case of difference.    Thepowers of the two Chambers, however, were not equal, asthey were in the case of the Central Government.      Theproblem in the Provinces, however, was rather different.
The question of the relations of the centre andof the units was always a difficult one in any federation and their respective fields had been set out in some detail,namely, a federal field, a provincial field, a concurrentfield and a residual field.       They had started from bitterand at first apparently insurmountable disputes betweenthe Moslems, who wished to keep everything in the Provinces,and the Hindus, who wanted all powers at the centre.Eventually it had been agreed that the last word should be with the Governor-General.       That was an advantage from our point of view as it enabled the Governor-General toregulate ttee^aj^atxi,miiJ! ^aB^ ^Js^s^^&amp;^&amp;&apos; between the centre and the Provinces^, i&amp;^^d^^^e^-^poi^i^s-.
The question of Federal and Provincial Financepresented another difficulty. There had been muchdismiss ion with the Government of India, who had pressed for &quot;a more rigid scheme:    for example, theimposition of an.obligatory Federal Income Tax onthe States ,   This had been felt at home to be t4*asig4*^. calculated to stir up trouble. Gons^eqsuestt-y-p u*th. k)LClr P^yL,&apos; 3cLt*^- ^ *&amp;*a*^Mj &quot;b%^ik,ithe financial provisions./w^^*^a?feared*her-&apos;*mefl?e^subject to possible future adjustment.   Provision hadbeen made, however, to ensure the payment of Imperialobligations and Services, including Defence and pensions ,    In order to make it as watertight aspossible, provision had been made for the final wordto be s*pok-en&quot;by an Order-in-Council, which would lieon the mable of both Houses of Parliament.Another difficulty was the question of theFuture of the Services.   This was one of the keyquestions.(The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs entered at this point.jHe wished to distinguish the case of India from thatof Ireland.    In the latter the safeguards had broken down because there was no-one to carry them out.In India, under this scheme the Governor-general would have full powers in this respect.    The Governor-General and the Governors roust have a cadre of whiteOfficials to carry out their own powers ,    For thisreason provision had been made for rights similar tothose that now existed, which would provide that theSecretary of State&apos;s Services and other IndianServices were safeguarded.   Details were set out inthe White Paper.   Provision was also being madeLhtL forthat certain posts should be ^mi^t^eH-t^ these services and should not be changed without theauthority of the Governor-General and Secretary of
e.   ^his was an absolutely essential safeguard;otherwise there would be no security/*^4*e**gPreand it would not be possible to recruit the Services.After a period o-p five years , during which no alteration could, be made,  it was proposed to have a statutory Inquiry, but to keep the power of making any change here in London.    Parliament would have complete authority to decide whether the recruiting of the Services should continue as at present or not.Some Provinces had wanted to leave these powers withthe Federal Government and Legislature or provincial governments, but he himself had set his face against this .Summing up, the Secretary of State admitted thatthe scheme was complicated and liable to attack, butin existing conditions he did not believe that abetter one could be devised.    He asked to place on record in the Cabinet Minutes how much he wasindebted, to the work of the Officials of the IndiaOffice and of ot)v r high Officials, such as Sir ClaudSchuster and Sir Maurice Gwyer.    For eight months the Officials had been working oontinuously onthis subject, and it was due to them that so completea picture was no^: available.    Much simpler Constitu-tions than this had taken years to complete.It was a remarkable feat, therefore,  to have worked out this complicated Constitution in so short aperiod.   He thought it had been wise to push onquickly in this way.   The appearance of vacillationand long delay in the past had caused, our bona fidesto be doubted.   During the last  18 months a definiteline of conduct had been adopted and the matter hadbeen pushed on at full speed.    He was inclined toagree with the Government of India that after a
preliminary splutter a good many people in india would come down in favour of the scheme, &quot;but ofcourse it was impossible to make an accurateforecast.   He could not judge how the scheme wouldbe accepted here, but, given the commitments of thepast, he thought it had been unavoidable to go on inthis manner.THE LORD CHANCELLOR congratulated the Secretaryof State, and as an Englishman thanked him for allit washe had done.   He thought/the best piece of work that had been done in recent times .   Anyone could producesome kind of a Constitution in a week or two, butthe circumstances of this Constitution were unprecedent-dented.    This was a plan that he thought would work,and would in fact be worked   not perhaps by allthe parties at once, but eventually.    Prom the firstwe could count on the Europeans and the Moslemsand some of the Hindu Liberals to work the scheme,and eventually, he thought, all would come in tohelp.    A good many different plans had been considered.This scheme had less risk;   than other plans, for thereason that it pursued a middle course.   If it had gone too far one way, chaos in India must have resulted:    if too far the other way, nothing wouldhave been accomplished.   This middle scheme, inhis viev , was the least that we could do to honourour pledges.   He thought it would settle India forthe lifetime of the youngest member of the Cabinet.If action were not taken now, extreme danger wouldresult both to India and to this country, and in afew years&apos; time we should be placed in appallingdifficulties.   The present scheme hung together well,and had better be put forward in its present form.
He hoped that members of the Select Committee wouldnot only consider any proposals that were made but would also think of their effect on other parts ofthe scheme.^The Lord Chancellor withdrew at thispoint, as he had to sit at theJudicial Committee of the Privy Councilon an important Canadian Appeal.)THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said he was particularly concerned with the financial aspect ofthe scheme and its repercussions on financial condi-tions here.   He did not pretend that the scheme,even with the safeguards,  did not increase the risks to the British Exchequer.    After much consideration,however, he was satisfied that no-one could produce any scheme without risks in this respect.    It was a choice of risks, and he was prepared to accept thepresent scheme as presenting the least risks.   he recalled that the Secretary of State for India had stated in C.P.-49A that he proposed to give hiscolleagues his recommendations on certain pointsorally.   He hoped, therefore, that the Secretary ofState would give the Cabinet the substance of certain amendments that had been agreed to to strengthen the safeguards .THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA said that  it hadbeen his intention to bring out these points orally.The object of the financial safeguards had been tobring out certain points included in the Report drawnup by a Committee of the Third Round Table Conference.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER recalled that atan earlier stage of this question he had expressedapprehensions lest we-might convey to India a different-impression to that which we had obtained ourselvesfrom the Reports   He did not think that our view
t-i-on.    It was very essential that there should be nomisunderstanding on this point, and consequently thefollowing amendment had been agreed as a new paragraph to Paragraph 32, on page 9:-&quot;If a situation should arise in which,all other requirements for the inauguration of the Federation havingbeen satisfied, it had so far proved impossible successfully to start theReserve Bank or if financial, economic or political conditions were such asto render it impracticable to start the new Federal and Provincial Govern-ments on a stable basis, it would inevitably be necessary to reconsider the position and determine in thelight of the then circumstances what course should be pursued.    If,unfortunately, such reconsiderationbecame necessary, His majesty&apos;s government are pledged to call intoconference representatives of indian opinion&quot;.Other amendments to the financial provisions hadbeen agreed to, mainly with the same object in view,to avoid any possible misunderstanding.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD  OF TRADE said he was satisfied with the safeguards  from a commercialpoint of view, but he-attached importance to thelast sub-paragraph of Paragraph 12? of the proposals,as follows:-&quot;Provision will be made on the same lines for equal treatment on a reciprocal basis of ships registeredrespectively in British India andthe United Kingdom&quot;.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA said that  evenwithout this paragraph, he had intended to cover
merchant shipping, and thought it had been covered.For political reasons he -would have preferred notto include the sub-paragraph quoted above,  since itwas likely to cause political difficulties in India.He appreciated, however, the difficulties of thePresident of the Board of Trade, and agreed to its inclusion.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE said he hadbeen advised that it was essential to include thisprovision as a separate stipulation, as in the caseof all Commercial Treaties.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE 00I-0NIES called attention to the last sub-paragraph of Paragraph 122of the proposals:-&quot;A Federal or Provincial law, however,which might  otherwise be void oh theground of its discriminatory character,will be valid if previously declared by the 0overnor-General or a Governor,as the case may be, in his discretion,to be necessary in the interests ofthe peace and tranquility of Indiaor any part thereof&quot;.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA explained thatthis was not a commercial but a police measure,required/in the event of a communal trouble in aparticular city, to which it would then be applied.The Government of India attached importance to it  .
PARAGRAPH 125.      THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR   -INDIA said t hat the arrangements for preventingdiscrimination applied not only to trade and shipping,hut also to professions such as lawyers and doctors.Some difficulty had been raised in regard to doctors.There was some hope how,  however,  of overcoming these difficulties as legislation was now under consideration in the Legislative Assembly which might lead to an agreement being reached.     He  proposed to insert a note to this effect in the White Paper. ^ A^.O ^ ^ StJ?^-THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES thendrew attention to the possibility that only fifty per cent of the seats available to the Indian States would be filledin which case the calculations:   as to the balance of parties and the risk of control Qf thetwo Houses by congress might be upset.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA agreed that this might happen.    The Government of India anticipated, however,that if fifty per cent of the States came in, the otherscould not stay out for long.    The Princes were likely touse their position to drive a hard bargain on a number of outstanding questions  and it was necessary that the cominginto force ofthe scheme should not be entirely in their hands.In regard to a suggestion that the expenses ofgovernment in India would be increased by these proposals,the Secretary of State thought that the increase wouldnot be very serious,  the Assembly being larger would be alittle more costly.   ministers salaries would be fixed inthe Act, though they might be raised later.On the question of the right of appeal to the privy Council, the SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA said thatthe policy was to try and restrict appeals.    At presentIndians wished to appeal on a great number of cases,
particularly in the case of capital sentences, though theappeals had at present to be ignored.    The present provisionsmight possibly be altered by the Select Committee.THE MINISTER OF HEALTH asked questions as tothe practicalworking of the financial safeguards and thepowers of the Governor-General for compelling the adoptionof his own proposals for balancing the Budget.    He pointedout the Financial Adviser had no executive powers.    The task of the Governor-General would be very difficult unless hehad the same knowledge as the Minister and there appeared tobe considerable possibilities of friction unless the financial adviser and the Finance Minister agreed.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA said that thealternative was to have a rival Finance Minister under theGovernor-General.    Although the Financial. Adviser had no executive powers, the Governor-General would be in a positionto give directions that he was to see all necessary papers.The Governor-General would often preside at meetings of his cabinet and could insist on all information being given to-the Financial Adviser.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF EDUCATION pointedout that the Financial Adviser would be in a position togive advice to the Governor-General if the Budget appearedinsecure.    At any point he could advise the Governor-general to inform the Finance Minister that he might have to interfereHe did not think there should be any special difficulty,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA did not thinkthat the independence of the Finance Minister would beatrophied as long as an effort was made to work the systemreasonably.    The Governor-General would see the financial adviser had access to all the documents he required. TheGovernor-General also had a special responsibility for seeing that the charges were aad-e; for example, he could, ifnecessary,  seize the Customs.
THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP EDUCATION,  revertingto the question of appeals to the Privy Council,  suggestedthat it would he possible for the Secretary of State forIndia to insert a footnote, stating that it was considered desirable to restrict appeals to the Privy Council,and that the point might be considered in the committee stage.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR INDIA agreed to considerthe suggestion, but asked for full liberty in the matter as it would be necessary to consult the Government of India.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP EDUCATION&apos;, referring to a suggestion that the task of the Viceroy would involveresponsibility and work beyond human capacity, thought this was not the case.    At present the Viceroy was responsible to parliament for everything in India,    Infuture he would be responsible for certain things only and otherwise would be advised by responsible Ministers,THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR recalled that hehad been a member of the Cabinet Committee.      From the firsthe had had misgivings as to our Indian policy and he felt it would not be right for him to allow his colleagues toassume that he was satisfied.      He could say that,  if wewere to go forward On a policy of responsibility withsafeguards, he was satisfied he could not suggest a betterscheme.    He agreed that the work of the Civil Servantshad been wonderful.    He violently rejected the suggestion,, ^however, that this was the minimum that was required toI t. UifaiUtitJ&apos; satisfy our pledges.      The present Government had givenl^c^ ^JuA^c /na pledge except that they would do their best to^jgi3^ -hU+bj iJiUt^AjJ fe^^^^h^a^^he^^s^rt^df.      The Conservative Ministers hadis- in^t igot the wording of the declaration altered so as to ensurethat the pledge did not go beyond this point.    He thought,therefore, that they could wipe eff the slate any pledgesexcept that the Government would do their best.    The first question On which he felt doubts w as as to whether the- 22 -
safeguards were effective.      That was the point on whichthe present House of Commons would fasten.      His doubts were, first,  as to whether there existed a superman who could fulfil the responsibilities of the Governor-General.In this constitution, the Governor-General would in somematters be a constitutional ruler and in others an autocrat,but subject to the Secretary of State,  and he had to be constantly watching to see if his authority was beinginfringed by anything done. If the  person could be foundto discharge these functions,  he could only do  so providedhe had at his disposal a proper machine.      That was thereason for the precautions in regard to the Public Service.Were the Cabinet satisfied that the Civil Service would prove effective in providing him with eyes and ears?   he himself felt the gravest doubt Qn the point.      Even today,the number of white officials in India was appreciablysmaller than in the past.      In the future it might be almost impossible to obtain white men of the right calibre.    even to-day, there were vast tracts of India where therewas     only one white man in an oasis surrounded bynumbers of Indians.      It was true that the- Indian civil servant had the right to appeal to the Governor-General,It was not likely he would be suffering so much in thematter of pay as in promotion and appointments.      No Viceroycould judge of such matters at a vast distance.   All thepatronage would be with Indian Ministers and it was doubtful if the Governor-General would ever be able to use his powers.This was even more true of the Governors,    In time there might even be Indian Governors and he doubted of their moralresponsibility for protecting white officials.      His nextdifficulty was in regard to the responsibility for law andorder.     He understood that the Secretary of State for India- 23 -
hoped, in most oases there would not he a Congressmajority, &quot;but what if this did happen?.    There would heCommunist Ministers  in charge of the police.      He didnot believe the best authorities in India believedthat a proper supply of information could be obtained in such circumstances,  and the whole system of law andorder might very easily break down. The fourthpoint was that if half the Indian States did not enterinto this scheme, the position would be very difficult.There would be tremendous pressure te go on with it inspite of their abstention.    He thought,  therefore, thatthe safeguards were likely to break down. India wouldbe run more and more by Indians who were very clever,but not good, administrators and often corrupt,  as theiro,wn religion compelled them to look after their ownrelations.    Justice would be sold, the poor oppressed,and there would be a break-down in the services.        Inthe result there might be a Moslem Empire,  or a seriesOf Communist outbreaks and eventually a situationdeteriorating into that now existing in China whereWar Lords exercised a precarious control over vast regions,He agreed that it was very difficult to find a practical alternative.    He himself had always thought that theright course was to endow the Governor-General with great powers and to provide him with an Assembly and Ministers,but without constitutional power to make him take their advice.        As every member of the Cabinet had te make up his mind before March 17th (when the proposals wereto, be published)  as to whether they could take responsibility for them, he had felt it only right tomake his position clear.       The belief of the Secretaryof State for India that the scheme could be made to work was the strongest argument in his own case.-24-
THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR INDIA expressedgratitude to the Secretary of State for War for the helphe had given on the Cabinet Committee, the more so ashe had never concealed his doubts as to the wisdom of thepolicy.      He himself did not  claim to be confident oroptimistic and shared many of the doubts of the Secretaryof State for War, but every alternative policy appearedto lead to a situation of great danger in which everyonein India wmi4- be against us.    For the last eighteen monthswe had been faced with much trouble in India and had takenmore drastic action than ever before.    Latterly, however,we had had considerable support and many doubters, especiallyamong the Princes,  had cvme down on our side.      any alternative plan which did not provide responsibility foranyone would put the Moslems against us, as they were determined to have provincial autonomy.       (He thought/the basic principles ioft&quot;raoji-a^l-nlAg.....Po-s-44i-jro-n--in..... -nd^^t-w^to knjp l^jiith tho -Moslems,    ^im^tr^ee&amp;^^sMe oday1 mo rethan at any time since the War.      To say that provincial autonomy would not be granted would put/the Moslems againstwereus.     So far as the Civil Servants /-  concerned, he pointedout that the present position was far from satisfactory.They were^in jeopardy even now.      So far as the position ofthe Governor-General was concerned, he was content to leave it to what the President of the Board of Education had said.The Governor-General was to have whatever staff he needed for his work and the money for that staff was not to be voted.So far as the Services were concerned,  even today three outof four officials were working under Indians.    He could nottell whether recruiting would continue or not,, but he wasreassured by the fact that three of the most efficient officials in India had lately sent their sons into the Indian Civil-25-
Service.       So far as patronage was concerned,power was retained under this scheme with theGovernor-General and the Governors to preventserious victimisation.      There was so much mutualsuspicion between Moslems and Hindus that perhapsthere would not be/discrimination against whiteofficials^     y^-f^^j
Referring to the police, he agreed that sir charles Teggart--  had been disquieted by the arrangementsmade.    Sir Charles feared that if Indian Ministers hadresponsibility, the sources of information would dry up.Sir Herbert Emerson and Sir John Anderson boththought the system by which the Governors could withholdpapers would work.    If a terrorist Government came into power, they would refuse to have it and take over theGovernment themselves.    He admitted, however, that he sharedmany of the Secretary of State for War&apos;s anxieties.THE LORD PRESIDENT OP THE COUNCIL said he hoped the Secretary of State for War would realise that everythinghe said had some echo in the hearts of all the Cabinet.   Asa Conservative his fundamental creed was the preservation ofthe Empire and some curious things had been done in relationto the white parts of the Empire by such Imperialists as thelate Lord   Balfour and Mr.Amery.    The present proposalsfor India might save India to the Empire, but if they werenot introduced we should certainly lose it.    The situation was full of dangers and difficulties, but these were greaterif action were not taken.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR shared generally the view of the Secretary of State for War.   He made someenquiries as  to the position of Aden on which the Secretaryof State for India re^assured him as explained above.The Cabinet agreed:-To approve the issue of the White Paperattached to CP.49 (33)  subject to amendmentsmade by the Cabinet Committee and to those mentioned above and subject to any smalldrafting alterations which the Secretary ofState for India might deem necessary.(NOTE:  In view of the absence of the PrimeMinister and the importance of thesubject, the Secretary was instructedto make a full summary of the discus-sion for purposes of record.)
HE PAR east the ArmsBprevi ousI Reference:I Cabinet 14I&apos;(53), Con-elusion 1.)iprobableCabinetfeet in p.2, The Lord President of the Council warned theCabinet that he was expecting to receive a message from the Prime Minister on the subject of the ParFast Arms Embargo, and it might be necessary for himto summon a Meeting of the Cabinet on the morning ofMonday next, March 13th, with a view to withdrax^ingthe embargo.The Chancellor of the Exchequer reminded theCabinet that at previous discussions on this subjectthey had been led to believe that our position wasdifferent from that        other countries,   He had morethan once been assured of this.    The President ofthe Board of Trade had then informed him that theFrench Government had the same powers as the Britishbut did not exercise them.   He had wondered if thisonly meant that they could,  if they wished, put on an embargo,   ^he Foreign Office, however, had made enquiries through the Paris Embassy and had obtainedfull information, from which it appeared, that theFrench Government were in exactly the same positionas the British and that the export of arms had to be licensed.The Cabinet took note that it mightbe necessary to hold an emergencyMeeting on the morning of Monday,March 13.  19 33.2, Whitehall Gardens, s.&apos;&apos;M,March 10,   1933.
