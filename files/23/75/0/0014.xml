1. The Cabinet had been summoned at very short notice to consider whether the embargo on arms and munitions to Japan and China should be continued ornot ,The Prime Minister informed his colleagues thatthe matter had been raised at the ministerial committee on Disarmament late on the previous evening.No conclusion had been reached, but the Committeehad felt troubled about the situation.    Othercountries had as yet done nothing to follow our lead and were known to be accepting and executing ordersfor the Par Past,   The immediate urgency arose owingto Questions to be answered in Parliament that after-noon.    For the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs to announce in Parliament that the embargo would be withdrawn would be a serious matter.    One way outthat had occurred to him was that immediately on his arrival at Geneva he himself should ask the arms-exporting Powers what they intended t.o do, and, if their reply was unsatisfactory, communicate at once with the Cabinet with a view to the lifting of the embargo.The Prime Minister&apos;s proposal commended itselfto his colleagues.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that he had to answer fourQuestions in Parliament the same afternoon (Appendix).He proposed to answer all these together.    In replying to. the Questions.as to the attitude of foreigncountries he encountered some difficulty.   Only oneof these replies was definitely opposed to theimposition of an embargo, namely, the reply fromthe United States of America.   Mr Stimson had made clear that there was strong opposition in Congress,
and that no action was possible until the special session of Congress, which was then due in the middleof April.    The matter was complicated, however, bythe fact that Mr Roosevelt had since announced thatthe Special Session of Congress would be summoned onThursday, March 9th.   The American answer had beenreceived before the embargo had been announced.    none of the other nations had definitely refused the proposal,though their attitude was ambiguous .   Belgium had said they would gladly join in measures which might beadopted by arms-producing and arms-selling countries as a whole.   The Czecho-Slovak Government was inprinciple in favour of common action, but wanted toknow beforehand details of the action proposed by theGreat Powers,  the conditions under which action wouldbe taken, and whether the United States would partici-pate,    Sweden agreed that the question should be settled by international agreement, but was not contemplatingunilateral action,    Italy had promised to consider theproblem,    (For Prance and Holland see the Conclusionsof the Cabinet Meeting referred to in the margin.)Meanwhile there appeared no immediate prospect of ameeting on the subject at Geneva.   Although, apartfrom the United States of America, there had been no definite refusal, there was no present reason to believethat any country intended to impose an arms embargo.The Cabinet were reminded that not only had noother country taken unilateral action, but that therewas a good deal of information to show that in practiceforeign countries were accepting and executing ordersfor the Par East, and Supplementary Questions were almost sure to be asked as to our information on this aspect of the question.
The President of the Board of Trade added thatthe Licence Officer of the Board of Trade was receiving   many requests for information as to how long the embargo would last,  and some reply wouldhave to be given.The Cabinet were reminded that the embargo hadbeen imposed a week before owing to the peculiarposition in which our Government found itself throughthe existence of the Arms Export Prohibition Orderof May 19, 1931, which made the Government of thiscountry, alone among the nations, responsible for the exportation or restriction of arms.   This had beenmade clear by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs in his speech in the House of Commons onMonday, February 27th,  1933, and he had also saidthat &quot;any efforts and any sacrifices are worth makingwhich will reduce the risk of a widening of the field of conflict or will tend to prolong the bloodshed&quot;.In these circumstances it was felt to be very difficultto announce today that we would license the exportation,of arms and munitions.It was suggested that the proper course would be,if international agreement was not reached, towithdraw the Arms Export Prohibition Order of May 19,1931, as soon as possible after the matter had been raised at Geneva.    On the other hand it was. pointedout that some important sections of public opinion would be distressed at the withdrawal of the Order,which enabled us to stop exportation of arms to countries in a state of revolution,-&apos;The Cabinet agreed  (a) That, in reply to the Questions to beasked the same day in the House ofCommons, it would be sufficient tostate, so far as the Government&apos;intentions were concerned, that thePrime Minister intended to raise thequestion with the arms-exporting and
arms-selling countries immediatelyafter his arrival at Geneva:(b) That, if a Supplementary question were asked as to the position offoreign armament firms, the reply should be that information isreaching the Government to theeffect that foreign armament firms are accepting and carrying outorders for the Par East,   Furtherinformation should be refused:(c) ^hat, in regard to requests for licences or information as to theprobable duration of the arms embargo in relation to the accept-ance of immediate orders offeringfrom China and Japan, the Presidentof the Board of Trade should have full discretion, on behalf of theCabinet, to give such replies ashe might deem appropriate to thesituation and in accordance withthe discussion.
2. The Chancellor of the Exchequer read thefollowing telegram:-&quot;Reuter Washington states Rooseveltissued proclamation giving Govern-ment absolute control nation&apos;s Goldsupply.    Proclamation which becomeseffective this morning places embargo on Gold Silver exports, forbidsearmarking Gold by foreign nationsproclaims National Bank fiolidayup to including Thursday. Reuter.&quot;The situation was extremely anxious.   Want ofconfidence in Dollars and Francs had resulted ina flight of capital to this covintry, and astonishingamounts were being sent here.   An effort had beenmade to keep down the amounts by using the exchange equalisation Account, which had been worked withconsummate skill.    It had been necessary to buyquantities of foreign currency.    In doing so,those responsible had had to face the possibilityof a collapse of United States currency, with consequential loss on the devaluation of the Dollar.The.matter had been under constant and careful review, more especially during the last 48 hours .A good deal of foreign currency had been converted into Gold, with the object of avoiding being caxightwith too much foreign currency on our hands .   Owingto the new development mentioned in the tel egramthe situation was more puzzling than ever, as it-was impossible to tell whether Gold would retainits value:    whether the United States could get back on to Gold, as they themselves anticipated;and whether France could remain on Gold,   There was even a possibility that there might grow up separateareas for Sterling, Continental and American Gold.A continuance of the policy of converting foreign currency into Gold was rendered impossible by
In the course of a. short discussion the cabinet were reminded that if America went completely offGold the situation in regard to War Debts might be altered very considerably.
