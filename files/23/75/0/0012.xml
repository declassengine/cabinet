In his Memorandum theit4-(55Ji Secretary of State said that on reflection he doubted whether the decision arrived at by theCabinet at the Meeting mentioned in the margincould stand.    That decision involved announcingin the Debate that the Government had decided to suspend the issue of licences for the export ofarms and ammunition to China and Japan for, say, a fortnight, in respect of new contracts.   Thiscourse now appeared to the Secretary of State tohave no. advantages, for the reasons stated in theMemorandum.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet&apos; that, in accordance withthe previous decision, he had consulted the Govern-ments of the principal armament-manufacturingcountries as to what course they proposed to adoptconcerning the supply of armaments to Japan and china in the present emergency.    Several countries had. sent preliminary replies .   Belgium could neverconsent unless the embargo was universal.   Hollandwould not agree to the inclusion of oil.   TheUnited States of America had no power to exercise control, and the necessary legislation could not be passed now mainly owing to the fear lest control should, involve a dangerous commitment in the far east:    no action was possible until a special session of Congress, due in the middle of April.
The French Government was willing to take any stepthat we judged fit and proper and which upheld theCovenant.There was general agreement that, in view of this information, it was useless to announce that an embargo would be limited to a fortnight   a time limit that had been mentioned at the previous discussion but not recorded in the Cabinet Minutes.On the one hand, in view of the position inthe United States,  it was clearly impossible that agreement among the armament-producing nations couldbe reached within a fortnight,    On the other hand,if we maintained a unilateral embargo for as longas a fortnight, there would be strong pressure forits retention.The Cabinet then discussed their policy fromthe point of view of the attitude to be adopted atGeneva and in the Debate in Parliament the same afternoon.There was general agreement that nothingeffective could be done except by international action, but that it was unnecessary to tie the handsof our delegate at Geneva by announcing beforehandin Parliament what instructions had been given tohim.In the course of the discussion each of thepossibilities that were open to the Government wasconsidered in turn, namely:-(l) To allow the exportation of armsfreely to both belligerents:(2) To prohibit, or to propose atGeneva to prohibit, their export to Japan only, allowing their export to China:(3) To prohibit, or to propose atGeneva to prohibit, the exportof arms and munitions  to bothbelligerents.
The first course, namely, to allow arms topass freely to both combatants, was recognised to be the one which, in view of the presentposition in America and other countries, was not unlikely to be reached.    If the United States ofAmerica could not or would not control exports, it seemed almost certain that other nations would refuse to do so.   Morally, however, this was not regarded as a defensible attitude for us to adopteither at home or at Geneva after the Assemblyof the League of Nations had condemned the actionof Japan.The second course, namely, to prohibit, or to propose at Geneva to prohibit, the export of armsand munitions to Japan only, allowing their export to China, was generally admitted to be the onewhich ought to be adopted on purely moral groundsif practical considerations could be disregarded.It was also the course likely to be favoured incertain quarters at Geneva.   Were it adopted,however, Japan would almost certainly retaliate,either by declaring a naval blockade of China orby intercepting ships and taking them into port.Either course involved the gfavest risks of extending the war.    For example, a blockade ofChina would involve a formal declaration of war.In that event not only the trade in arms but thewhole of our imports by sea to China would cease.Even if such a course were,pressed for, as mightwell happen at Geneva, It was urged that we shouldresist, since the brunt of the consequences would fall upon this country.    In this connection theFirst Lord&apos; of the Admiralty, who was absentindisposed, had written a letter which contained-3-
the following comment on this policy: -&quot;In my opinion we cannot go into a scheme ofthis sort without dire risk of war, and inconnection with this&apos; I think the Cabinet should know that the Admiralty have lately had informa-tlon to the effect that the Japanese have adefinite scheme for an attack on Singapore.The Information stated that this Force was actually ready to embark at the time of the shanghai crisis of 1932, and is possibly readynow&quot;.This confirmed the view of the Secretary of State for War,who warned the Cabinet that we were not in a position froma defensive point of view to run any risk of war in the far east.      The second course, therefore, was rejected as highly dangerous.One objection to the third proposal, namely, thepossibility of allowing arms and munitions to neitherbelligerent, was that our armament industry would be hit ascompared with other nations.     Not only should we lose immediateorders, but also repeat orders, and other nations might be deterred from giving orders in this country for fear thatlicences might be refused when the munitions were most needed.It was suggested, however, that the operations in Jehol were likely to be so short that there would not be any considerableorders.      Doubt was raised also as to whether the armament industry did depend so much upon foreign orders, and it wassuggested that in any event It was a dying industry.It was urged that the force of moral sense in this country must not he under-rated, and that large numbers of peoplerevolted against the idea that we should show profits out of supplying munitions in a war of this kind.     ItTwas pointed out,however, that the moral reason for this course lost a good dealof its weight when it was realised that the prohibition of export of munitions to both belligerents would greatly handicapChina, which was poorly armed, as against Japan, which was wellarmed, with a large armaments industry.       In     effect     weshould     be     assisting     Japan     as     against     China.
The suggestion that our armament industry wasnot dependent on foreign orders was contested, andthe anxiety of the three Service Departments inregard to the deterioration of the private armament industry was emphasised.    Consequently it wassuggested that the only result of this course wouldbe to send orders abroad and to injure still furtherour armaments industry without obtaining any moraladvantage ,The President of the Board of Trade confirmed that the result of this policy was likely to be to deter orders to the armament and shipbuilding industries   a matter which gave him serious concern.In mitigation of this objection, however,  it wassuggested that it should, be made clear that all existing contracts should be allowed to be completed,and that the embargo should apply only to futurecontracts.    Thus, foreign Governments or firmsplacing orders for armaments in the future with thiscountry would know that in the present instance our policy had been to allow all contracts made beforethe crisis to be carried out, and this should reassurethem in placing orders here in the future.As a further mitigation, the Prime minister suggested that it ought to be possible to force adecision at Geneva within two or three days.The third course, it was urged, could be defendedon the ground that our policy was to stop the fighting and to prevent its extension.The Cabinet then discussed briefly paragraph of the Secretary of State &apos;s Memorandum (CP .-48 (33))of the Covenant,dealing with our attitude under Article XVI/ and took the decision recorded below in Conclusion (d).
In conditions where it was recognised that every course was open to objections, the Cabinet(a) That, pending the issue of negotiationswith foreign armament-producing countries,the issue of future export licences both to China and Japan should be suspended.The stispension would apply to completedarms and munitions, as laid down in theOrder in Council of May 19, 19 31 (butnot to the materials from which sucharmaments are made) .    It would applyto all contracts entered into on or after February 27, 1933, but not toorders placed before that date.   Thiscourse could be defended on the groundthat our policy was to stop the fighting and. to prevent its extension.(b) That our representative at Geneva shouldnot be instructed to take a lead atGeneva in this matter, since the onlylead that he could take which would be acceptable to Geneva would be for an embargo on arms to Japan only.    this might lead to an extension of the conflict and could not be contemplated.(c) That it was unnecessary to tie the handsof our delegate at Geneva by announcingbeforehand in Parliament what instructions had been given to him.(d) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should be authorised to state in Parliament that in present conditions,and In the situation now prevailing, HisMajesty&apos;s Government do not considerthat there can be any question of theapplication of the economic sanctionsof Article XVI of the Covenant to thedispute relating to Manchuria.agreed2, Whitehall Gardens,S.W.1,February 27, 1933.
