(previous reference:Cabinet 1P6(55), Con-c Ins ion %,)(Mote:  A copy of a private notice of theQuestion and of the reply theretoIs attached as Appendix I)..The arms embargo.telegram (C,P.-64 (33)) from the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs (at Geneva) to thelord President of the Council, dated March 13th,on the subject of the Embargo on Arms to the far east.    The telegram stated that enquiries at Genevahad. made it plain that no international agreement was realisable, at any rate for some time,, andthat the Prime Minister and. the Secretary of Stateconsidered thatin these regrettable circumstances the provisiona&apos;! announcement made in the House ofCommons on February 27th should be withdrawn.After a short discussion the cabinet agreed:-(a) That the provisional embargo onthe export to either China orJapanof any articles mentionedin the Arms Prohibition Order,1931, which was announced in the&apos;House of Commons on February 27th,1933, should be withdrawn, and thatlicences should be issued from thepresent date:(b) That the terms of the announcement in Parliament should be drawn upby the following Ministers:-The Lord President of the Council,The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The President of the Board of Trade.
2.      The Cabinet had. before them copies of atelegram from the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs to the Lord President of the Council(No.180 L.N.) giving an account of the efforts ofthe Prime Minister and the Secretary of State atGeneva to save the Disarmament Conference from a breakdown.    It was possible that the Prime minister might decide to put before the Conference the general lines of the draft Convention which the Cabinet hadalready examined and provisionally authorised, butthe Secretary of State for War and the Cabinet wereto considerasked/whether the proposal with regard to Tanks couldnot be modified, for if nothing more was proposedthan that manks of unlimited number should not exceed16 tons each, this must involve permission to Germanyto provide herself with Tanks on similar terms.The Lord President of the Council read to hiscolleagues a private letter he had received from thePrime Minister on the situation he and the foreign secretary had found at Geneva.The Secretary of State for War gave to theCabinet a summary of a statement he had made at aMeeting of the Ministerial Committee on Disarmament,held on the 7th March, 1933, on the subject of Tanks.This statement was of so secret a character that Ithad not been recorded in detail In the Minutes of the ministerial Committee.     Its effect was to show thatTanks were definitely a substitute for men in our Army,and that this was a policy which we had initiated,partly as a result of the enormous reductions in personnel which had been effected after the war.Tanks had become pivotal in our military scheme ofdefence.     A five year holiday in Tank construction,as proposed in the telegram under consideration, would
result in making our Army incapable of conductingwarfare successfully for years to come.     Even plansthat had been approved before the cancellation of theassumption that no war would take place for ten years from any given date could not be carried out if aholiday in Tank construction were imposed.     Thisforwas a policy/which no Secretary of State for War could make himself responsible.     In reply to questions, theSecretary of State for War pointed out that our programme of mechanisation was so far behind our requirements that it would have to be pursued,irrespective of foreign nations in general, and ofGerman tank construction in particular.     He thoughtIt unlikely that Germany could build any large numberof Tanks, owing to their high cost and other more immediate requirements, such as the development ofan Air Force.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled thatthe Secretary of State for War had developed his case at greater length before the ministerial committee.   The matter had been gone into very fully, and he thought the Cabinet could hardly beasked to take a decision reversing the previous decision.   He did not gather from the telegram thatthe Delegation^ difficulties in making a good case against Germany on Tanks resulted from any statement made by foreign Delegations.   It was rather thefeeling of our own Delegation.   He realised fromthe statements made by the Secretary of State forWar that Tanks were the pivot of the scheme on whichthe Army Cou.ncil depended, and that without Tankstheir ability to conduct any kind of war would comeinto question.    To give up our whole scheme on the chance of some success at Geneva appeared to be
at least premature.    If a scheme was put forwardhe thought it should be on the previously agreedbasis .    If, later on, it transpired that Tanks werethe stumbling-block, the matter might be re-examined in order to see if any modification were possible.He hoped, however, that at the present moment theCabinet would not go back on their previous decision.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs pointed out that the British Delegation could makea good case against Germany on every point exceptTanks.    On the other hand, the Secretary of Statefor War, in his opinion, had made a most convincingcase.   He doubted, however, whether in any case theChancellor of the Exchequer would be able to find the money required by the Secretary of State for war to complete his programme.    On the previous day ithad occurred to him that the best plan might be to adjourn the Disarmament Conference, as in existingcircumstances, when there was so much talk of war on the Continent, the possibilities of successmust be slight.   He gathered, however, that if this were proposed, all the blame would be placed on thiscountry.    In any event the Cabinet had not sufficientinformation to advise that course.   On the whole he- supported the view of the Chancellor of theExchequer, but emphasised the importance of theCabinet sharing all the responsibility for the PrimeMinister&apos;s action.The Secretary of State for the Colonies agreed with this latter suggestion.    He pointed out that the ministerial Committee&apos;s recommendations had deliberate-ately represented the extreme limit to which we could go, and stood on record as such.   He reminded theCabinet of the definite statement made of our policy
on Tanks in the published Statement of November 17,1932, and quoted the following passage:-&quot;Indeed, a universal prohibition would inevitably involve, as far as theUnited Kingdom is concerned, in viewof its world-wide responsibilities,an increase in its present land forcesin terms of man-power, and would thus,as a measure of disarmament, tend to defeat its own ends &quot;,The Lord Chancellor suggested that theSecretary of State for War should go to Geneva.The Secretary of State for War was willing togo anywhere, but had nothing to add to the statement the had made to the Ministerial Committee.The Secretary of State for Air was opposed to a departure from plans that had been exhaustivelyconsidered.    If we were to propose a plan it shouldbe something definite.The Secretary of State for India supported theChancellor of the Exchequer and suggested that theright course was to send the Prime Minister an account of the discussion and let him decide.The Lord President of the Council read to theCabinet an extract from the White Paper of July,1932, in regard, to Tanks:-&quot;Moreover, in a small voluntarilyenlisted army like our own, they constitute an essential compensationfor lack of numbers which it would beimpossible to surrender.   As far as this country is concerned,  in view ofits world-wide responsibilities, anygeneral prohibition would require anincrease in our present land forcesin terms of man-power and. thus, as ameasure of disarmament, would tendto defeat its own ends,&quot;The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested thatthis should be quoted in the telegram to Geneva.The First Commissioner of Works questioned themeaning of the following sentence in paragraph 4 ofthe telegram:-
&quot;(e) Without this proposal we gravelyfear that not only will othersconstruct tanks without limithut the whole of the rest of thedraft may be rejected as not beingconsistent with the treatment promised&quot;.He asked what was the meaning of this?The Secretary of State for War recalled that oneof the reasons why the Ministerial Committee had felt that any plan was rather dangerous was that itwould give Germany an opportunity to break away fromthe Conference and put the blame on us.   He thoughtit important not to give Germany any g-round for doing so.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That, while recognising and sharingthe anxieties of &quot;the Prime Ministerand the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs at Geneva, and anxious toassist them in every way, it would notbe justifiable to risk undermining our whole scheme of military defence on the chance of a possible, though not very probable, success at Geneva today:(b) That a summary of the discussion shouldbe telegraphed at once to Geneva:(c) That the Secretary should record inthe Minutes  of the Cabinet a fullsummary of the discussion for theinformation of the Prime Minister and secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.(A copy of the telegram as sent to geneva is attached in Appendix III.)

APPENDIX I,QUESTION AND ANSWER IN THE HOUSE OP COMMONS. ONMtNDAY, 15TH MARCH, 1935.BY PRIVATE NOTICE:MR. LANS BURY   -   To ask the Lord President of theCouncil whether the Government are now in aposition to make any further statement on thequestion of the Arms Embargo? .(Answered by the Lord President of the Council.)Yes Sir.     The decision of the Government announced by my Right Hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary on the 27thFebruary, that no licences for the export of any articlementioned in the Arms Export Prohibition Order of 1931to either China or Japan would be authorised as from that day, was, as stated at the time, a provisional arrangementpending the opportunity of international consultation and decision.Since then, the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretaryhave had the opportunity Of discussing this matter withthe representatives of various other countries, and theyhave now informed us that, in their opinion, there is no prospect of any international agreement upon the subject in the near future.In these circumstances, no useful purpose would be served by maintaining an embargo observed by this countryalone, and, accordingly, the Government have decided toremove.it as from to-day.At the same time, the Government remains firmlyconvinced that the only satisfactory solution of a problem,which is bound to recur in the future, is to be found in aninternational agreement.Accordingly, it is their intention vigorously to pursue the conversations already begun as and when opportunity offers with the earnest desire to arrive at a form ofagreement which will in the future secure uniformity ofaction on this important subject.

H.M.. &apos;s Consul (Geneva).12th March., 1933,D.     1.40 a.m., 13th March, 1933VR,     2.15 a.n., 13th March, 1833,No. 180 L.N.Jniaedlate,.Following for Mr. Baldwin from Secretary ox State,,In viov/ of the moeting of the Cabinet tomorrow you may care for the following report.The Prime Minister and I, as a result of manyinterviews yesterday and today, entirely confirmMr. Eden&apos;8 view that the Disarmament Conference is in amost serious condition and adjournment with nothing moredone would he equivalent to veritable downfall,     TheCommittees now sitting have been marking time and are ina state of deadlock.     Consequently the choice is betweenletting the Conference fade sway without anything materialbeing achieved and making promptly a new effort alongsome fresh lines,     Consequences of a breakdown are so serious that we are bound to examine the alternative,unattractive and doubtful of acceptance as it may be,with close attention.     It would (two grps.&apos; undec,)proposal put before the Conference by the United kingdom on the general lines of draft which Cabinet examined andprovisionally authorised after amendment.2.     It may well be that adoption of this course &quot;willnot ...
not produce agreement and that Germany will, run out.But even so the fact remains that we (grp. undec.) draftconvention will stand us in good stead and Prime Ministercan neither stay here nor go away with nothing attempted.It is not necessary to emphasise what may happen if germany declares herself dissatisfied and claims freedom to re-arm.     In such conditions it might make a great difference if cur positive action now received thegeneral support of world opinion,30     In going through the draft we see our way tomake a good case against Germany on every point exceptone.    Exception is tanks.    We would earnestly ask thatthe Secretary of State for War and the Cabinet should consider whether in view of all that is at stake inother directions proposal on this head cannot he modifiedif nothing more is proposed&apos;than that tanks of unlimitednumber sha.ll not exceed sixteen tons each, this mustinvolve permission to Germany to provide herself withtanks on similar terms,;    Concession of equality of rights which we made and signed last December cannot he applied.We do not see how this can he avoided unless there isuniversal agreement for holier in tank construction for five years.4.    We fully appreciate the arguments previouslypresented against this hold proposal hut (a) it is aproposal which only becomes operative if every other country agrees,  (b) if Germany and other countries startconstructing unlimited tanks we apprehend that the needfor yet more construction on our part will.be such as togive ...
3,give us grave concern both on financial and defencegrounds, (c) without this proposal we gravely fear that not only will others construct tanks without,limit butthe whole of the rest of the draft may be rejected as not being consistent with the treatment promised.   these considerations are so serious that we might be driven back into the position of proposing nothing at all when a positive scheme would be greatly in the interest bothof our own country and of European peace.5.     You will understand that the above permission-is made provisional upon the Prime Minister   resolvingto table a plan.     On this we are not yet decided butevents may move very quickly.    We are greatly concerned&apos;by the aim of Germany&apos;s Air Minister as indicated inBerlin telegram to Geneva No. 18 of last night.
APPENDIX III.IMMEDIATE.-     Following for Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs from Lord Presidentof the Council:Your telegram No. 180 L.N. was discussed at a meeting of the Cabinet this morning.      LordHailsham summarised the highly secret statement he had made to the Ministerial Committee on Disarmament ohMarch 7th showing that tanks are the pivot of ourpost-war army and that a holiday in tank constructionfor five years, such as you suggest, would render our army almost impotent to conduct any kind of war andeven to carry out plans approved before the removalof the assumption of ten years peace.      The cabinet were reminded also of the very specific statement made in the White Paper of July and repeated in theWhite Paper of November 17th, 1932, that, so far asthe United Kingdom is concerned, in view of its world-wide responsibilities, any general prohibition wouldrequire &quot;an increase in our present land forcesin terms of man-power and thus as a measure of disarmament would tend to defeat its own ends&quot;.In the White Paper of the 17th November it was pointedout that the admission of equal treatment would makeit impossible to deny in principle to Germany the rightto possess a limited number of tan&amp;s.While recognising and sharing your anxieties,and anxious to assist you in every possible way, theCabinet felt that it would not be justifiable to riskundermining our whole scheme of military defence on
the chance of a possible, though as we gather not very probable,  success at Geneva.      In reaching this conclusion the Cabinet were not unmindful of your owncaution to the Ministerial Committee that any statement to-day is liable to be quoted against us on futureoccasions.       We suggest that if you put forward ascheme it should be on the previously agreed basis,and that if later on the proposals as to tanks prove astumbling-block, the question should be re-examinedto see if any modification   is possible.The Secretary of State for War would gladlycome to Geneva if you think it is desirable, buton this subject he has nothing to add to thestatement he made to the Ministerial Committee.
