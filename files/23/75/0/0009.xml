previous reference:Cabinet 68(32), Con-elusion 16 ,8. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum, by the3Secretary of State for India (.C.P.-26 (3^)) circulatingfor the consideration of his colleagues some papers in regard to the political situation in India, withparticular reference to the general question of Eritishpolicy as to Mr Gandhi and the civil disobedienceprisoners .    In his Memorandum the Secretary of Statedrew special attention to an important and valuablenote by Sir H.G,Haig, the Home Member of the Viceroy&apos;sCo\mcil, with.a great deal of which he was in agreement.There could be no question of a negotiation as to theterms on which the civil disobedience prisoners wouldrecover their liberty, and there were certain individ-actuals who could not in any event be released at present.The Secretary of State agreed with Sir H .G, H.aig&apos;sstrong opposition to an act of grace amounting to aspectacular gaol delivery, but he was not sure thatwe had       alternative feast to let the policy of the last twelve months take its course        that there was a^yrelaxation of the present regime which could safely beundertaken..The Secretary of State for India made a statement to the Cabinet describing in some detail the politicalsituation as affecting civil disobedience prisoners,at the end. of which he said that his  own view was,while making no change in policy, to speed up therelease of the existing prisoners, who at presentnumbered 13,500, and meanwhile to watch carefully thesituation created by an increase in the numbers released.This view, he said, was shared by Sir Herbert Emerson,&apos;a former Secretary to the Government of India in theHome Department, who was about to become Governor ofthe Punjab.oliticalSituationn.
In the course of a short discussion a proposal was made that the Secretary of State should suggest to the Government of India not to adhere too closely to the line they had hitherto taken, that Mr Gandhicould not he released until he gave a pledge not to revive civil disobedience.    It was suggested that abetter formula would be that he should not be released &quot;until there is no longer a danger of civildisobedience&quot;.The Secretary of State for India said he would draw the Viceroy^ attention to this suggestion.The Cabinet agreed  To give their support to theSecretary of State for India&apos;proposal as set forth above.
%AVAL CONSTRUC-        3. The Cabinet had before them a Most SeeretTT0N FOR 1933.   Memorandum by the pirst Lord of the Admiralty(0 P -25 (33)) reminding his colleagues of a serious(Prevxous lu,f&apos;        -    &quot;&quot;flSbSSt0 V warning he had given to the Cabinet in CP .-64 (32),elusionT)       at the time of the crisis at Shanghai, in regard to &amp;. the Navy1 s deficiency in material necessary for the performance of its duty in any emergency.    On theunderstanding that the question of adopting a regular programme for remedying the whole of the deficiencies within some definite period should beconsidered before the Estimates for 1934 were submitted, the Admiralty were prepared to take onlya small step in the direction of making good the deficiencies in question, and he had accordingly proposed to the Chancellor of the Exchequer thefollowing special provision in addition to the normal--requirements of the year:-Defensive equipment and reserves  100,000Oil Fuel Storage 118,000Flights for Fleet Air Arm 146,000Oil Fuel 100 pop-  464,000.The Chancellor of the Exchequer had found himselfunable to agree to the inclusion of any part of thisprovision, for reasons set out in the Memorandum, butthe First Lord hoped that the Cabinet would feel ableto authorise at least a substantial part of the verysmall additional expenditure he proposed;    otherwisehe thought the Admiralty were entitled to have an assurance from the Cabinet that they realised and% took responsibility for the continued unreadiness ofthe Navy .The First Lord of the Admiralty informed the Cabinetthat when the existence of so many naval deficienciesIwas brought to his notice he had felt bound to notifythem to the Cabinet.   He suggested that some time formula
was required to take the place of the former assump-tion governing the Estimates of the Defence Servicesthat from any given date there would be no. major war for ten years, and he suggested that some investigationshould be undertaken with a view to making a start indefensive prepare.tions ./ next year.   He was particularly apprehensive owing tothe situation in the Par East, and in this connection he drew attention to a recent telegram (No.38, ofFebruary 9th) from the British Ambassador at Tokyostating that a well-balanced and experienceddiplomatic colleague was warning his Government thata threat of sanctions would not merely be resistedbut might well be answered by immediate hostile actswithout a declaration of war.     At Singapore the dockswere in a very unprotected state, more especially asattack, if it ever came, was likely to be made without warning,The Secretary of State for War and the Secretaryof State for Air both called attention to correspondingdeficiencies in their revSpective Departments ,    Theformer stated his intention o&quot;f circulating a summaryof a Minute in which the retiring Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff had put on record the position of the ArmyWhen the Cabinet were being asked to take responsibilityfor the present position he felt bound to let themknow, as he had done a year ago, what that position was.The Secretary of State for Air expressed dissatisfation as to the co-ordination of the Services.The Chancellor of the Exchequer drer attention to aMemorandum by the Treasury (C.I.D. 1087-B) which hadbeen considered by the Committee of Imperial Defencewhen they recommended the cancellation of the ten-yearassumption, the last sentence of which was as follows:--5-c-
if m^hat a start should be made in providing for commitments whichare purely defensive,  includingthe defence of bases&quot;, first&quot;They do, however, submit that todayfinancial and. economic risks are by far the most serious and urgent thatthe country has to face, and that other risks must be run until thecountry has had. time and opportunityto recuperate and our financial situation to improve&quot;.That situation still applied.    The Treasury did notdeny the risks, but considered the financial riskgreater than the war risk.   He recalled that theCommittee of Imperial Defence had also recommendedthat a start should be made in providing for commit-ments which are purely defensive, including the defenceof bases, priority being given to requirements in the far East.   That seemed to him the only policy.The Prime Minister agreed with the First Lord ofthe Admiralty that it was more convenient to work on some time assumption than to be without a hypothesisat all.   The discussion tended to show, however, thatat the present moment it would be difficult to find any assumption on which even to base an inquiry.    Inthe financial conditions described by the Chancellorof the Exchequer the Cabinet would have to take responsibility,  as they had done before, for the deficiencies of the Defence Departments.    If therewas any matter of particular urgency the defence minister concerned should raise it through the ordinarychannels.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To take responsibility for the deficiencies in the Defence Services which are imposed by the difficult financial situation ofthe country at the present time:(b) l^&apos;Lthn pol:i?y should be that recommendedby the Committee of Imperial Defence onMarch 22, 19 32:-
priority being given to requierements in the&apos; ParEas t:e) That if any questions of specialurgency arise, the Defence ministers concerned should raise them throughthe usual channels .

fjfoAL MINES.JV .. .[internationalConventionlimitingHours of Work.pPreviousReference:Cabinet 12(52), Con-conclusion   3).FA.5, Trie Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (C.P.-27(33)) on thesubject of the International Convention on the Hoursof Work in Coal Mines, In which he asked, as a matterof urgency, for a decision on the line the Secretary for mines should take at a meeting called by the Internation-al Labour Office to take place on February 20th todiscuss the position of the Convention.     He recalled that in February, 1932, the then Secretary for Mineshad announced, with the authority of the Government,that we were favourably disposed towards the Convention;that the detailed application of some of its provisionspresented problems that were under consideration;    thatas soon as these points had been disposed of the Govern-ment would be prepared to ratify, provided that six othercountries did so at the same time.      The InternationalLabour Office had now secured from six countriesstatements that they were ready to proceed to simultaneously-Carbonaceous ratification and had invited the Governmentsconcerned to attend an informal meeting at Geneva onFebruary 20th &quot;to examine the situation in the light ofrecent developments&quot;.      The President of the Board ofTrade warned his colleagues that If the Convention (which involved a reduction in this country of ^ of an hour aday) became operative, there was grave danger that thepresent peace in the coal industry would be replaced byserious trouble, as the present wage rates could not bemaintained if hours were reduced unless the coal tradeshowed a more marked improvement than could yet before seen.      He had already received a Deputation from theMining Association.      He therefore recommended that our representatives should be instructed to press technicalobjections at the meeting, but he warned his colleagues
that if we adopted these delaying tactics   a policy to which he saw no alternative - the Government wouldhe the subject of public criticism in Europe generallyfrom the International Miners&apos; Federation, and in thiscountry from the Miners&apos; Federation.     Attached to theMemorandum was an Appendix setting out the more importantobjections and the line which the President recommendedthat the Secretary for Mines should take on each.In the course of discussion it was suggested tha.tthe position would be very much eased if the leadersof the Miners&apos; Federation were themselves to formulateobjections (which they were believed to hold) to the ratification of the Convention in its present form.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the proposals of the Presidentof the Board of Trade as set forth in cp.-27  (35):(b) That the President of the Board ofTrade should continue efforts up toFebruary 20th in order to try and find some point or points on which1 theGovernment would have the support bothof the Miners&apos;  Federation and the mining association in urging objections to ratification of the Convention in itspresent form.

CO-operative societies.ProposedTaxation of.(previous reference:Cabinet 22(32), Con-elusion 2).7. The Cabinet had before them a Note by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP.-19(33))  covering the Report of the Committee which v;as set up, inaccordance with the decision of the Cabinet at theMeeting referred to in the margin, to enquire intothe position of Co-operative Societies in relationto Income Tax.      The principal recommendations ofthe Committee were as follows:-(a) That Co-operative Societies should becharged to Income Tax in respect ofall trading, whether with members or with non-members, the charge beingcomputed in accordance with theordinary provisions as to allowable ex-penses, wear and tear, etc., applicableunder the Income Tax Acts in the caseof corporate bodies carrying on trade:(b) That the &quot;divi.&quot; should be treated asa trade expense:(c) That the statutory exemption granted by Section 39 (4) of the Income Taxhot, 1918,  should be withdrawn:There was an additional recommendation:That Co-operative Societies shouldmake their distributions of interestwithout deduction of Income Tax, the recipients being directly chargeableIn accordance with their individualliabilities.The Report further stated that if the above recommendations were carried out, certain legislation would be necessary.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That a Cabinet Committee, composed asfollows -The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs,The Secretary of State for War -should be set up for the purpose ofobtaining information as to theapplication of the principles of theReport of the Committee on the Positionof Ob-operative Societies in relationto Income Tax, with complete discretion to consult any person whose assistancethey might think desirable:(b) That in the meantime the publication of theReport should be suspended.
old Miningn Native.eserves .previous reference:Cabinet 5(33), Con-conclusion O8.The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for the Colonies (CP.-31 (33)) onthe subject  of Gold Mining in Native Reserves in Kenya,in which he ashed for a Cabinet decision on a question raised in the recent Debate in the House of Lords,when the Archbishop of Canterbury had sought an under-taking that no action should be taken on the Report ofthe Carter Commission (the Land Commission which isenquiring into the adequacy of the Native reserves and the working of the Lands Trust Ordinance) untilParliament had considered the Report.   The Secretaryof State thought it would be unwise and contrary toNative interests to give so comprehensive a pledge,which would preclude prompt action being taken wheneveryone agreed that such action was necessary.    Inthe circumstances he thought the answer ought to bethat Parliament would certainly be given full opportunity-nity of discussing the Report, but that it would be unreasonable to say that no action of any kind shouldbe taken in advance of a Parliamentary Debate, whichmight not be immediately possible.   He would also draw attention to the proviso governing the terms of refer-ence to the Carter Commission, and would say that,notwithstanding this,  if the Report recommended any changes in the provisions of the Ordinance these shouldhad an opportunity ofnot be carried into effect until Parliament had/discussing the Report.   On the question of prospecting, theGovernor of Kenya had had a report from Sir AlbertKitson, which had been published.   The Governor desiredto follow Sir Albert Kits on&apos;s advice, with which theSecretary of State concurred, but he had laid down thecondition that the Governor must be satisfied that hisadministrative arrangements were complete and satisfac-tory before prospecting was allowed in any area.
The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the proposals of theSecretary of State for the colonies as set forth in CP.-31 (33), and(b) To suggest that the Secretary ofState for the Colonies should invite the Archbishop of Canterburyto visit him in connection with aletter from the Governor of Kenyawhich the Secretary of State had read to the Cabinet .-14-
