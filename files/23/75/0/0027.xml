RUSSIA.Anglo-soviet relations .Arrest ofBritishSubjects .(previous reference:Cabinet 26(S3), Con-clusion 3.)\1. The Prime Minister said he had received aletter from some of the Leaders of the Oppositioncontaining a suggestion for extending the russian trade Agreement temporarily pending the developmentof the existing difficulties with Soviet Russia.As the matter of the Russian Trade Agreement fell within the province of the Board of Trade, the PrimeMinister handed the letter to the President of theBoard of Trade to deal with.
GERMANY.Icent Perse en-on of Jewsj Others .i-previous/Inference:bbinet 2353j, Con-2. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that he had received a despatch from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Berlin on the perse-cution of Jews and other persons in Germany,   Thereport was objective and not critical in character.The question of publication was certain to be raised.His present view was that it would be better not to publish the Despatch.A suggestion was made that the non-publicationof the Despatch would be rendered easier if theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs were to showit confidentially to Lord Reading and Sir HerbertSamuel, and later perhaps to Mr Lansbury.    He mightshow them at the same time the Ambassador&apos;s telegramadvising against publication, in the interests ofthe Jews in Germany.The Prime Minister suggested that in the debate on the following day the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs might consider saying something aboutthe general European situation.   The recent episodein Germany was not a negligible factor in that situa-tion.    International affairs were delicate at thebest, but recent events had come on the public withsomething of a shock.   He might indicate that this government considered that the situation had beenworsened by certain events .   This was a suggestionrather than a definite proposal, and he hoped todiscuss the matter with the Foreign Secretary.    Inthe meanwhile he thought it would be a mistake ofthe first order to publish the Despatch from Berlinas it would render the Ambassador almost useless inthe future.
The Cabinet agreed --(a) That the Despatch from His Majesty&apos;ambassador at Berlin should not bepublished:(b) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affaire, in reply to aQuestion to be addressed to him the same afternoon, should statethat a Despatch had been receivedfrom His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador butthat it was impossible for him tomake a statement today, as it hadnot yet been examined;   he understood,however, that the question would beraised in the Debate on the following day:(3) That the Secretary of State shouldalso have discretion,  if he thought fit, to show the Despatch to lord reading, Sir Herbert Samuel andMr&apos; George Lansbury, with a view to avoiding press in? e for publication,in the interests of the Jews inGermany:(d) That the Secretary of State should discuss with the Prime Minister thedesirability, in the Debate on thefollowing day, of speaking on thelines suggested by the Prime Ministerand summarised above.
rig RUSSIAN 3. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum byrn0DS (import prohibition) the President of the Board of Trade (CP,-101 (33))covering a Note prepared in his Department on the(previous two following points on which decisions were requiredReference:Cabinet 23 if action was to be taken under the Russian Goods(33), Con-elusion 2.) (Import Prohibition) Act, 1933:-p.o tffzz) f. A,   What shall be included in anyProclamation issued underSection 1.B,   The policy to be adopted by theBoard of Trade in issuing licencesunder Section. 2,Annexed to the Note was a list of goods which it wasnot proposed to prohibit.The President of the Board of Trade explainedthat in raising these questions he had in mindprincipally that the Board of Trade had to make preparations for action if and when the decision wastaken.   He had always contemplated that that decisions would rest with the Cabinet.This raised the question as to the procedure to&quot;beadopted during the Recess for taking a decision inthe event of the trial of the British prisoners inRussia having an untoward end next week.    suggestions were made either for a Special Meeting of the cabinet or, alternatively, for the appointment of a CabinetCommittee.On re-examining the list of the classes of goods to be specified in the Proclamation as submitted onpage 2 of the Board of ^rade Memorandum, the Cabinetgradually came to the conclusion that the articlesto be.included therein might very likely vary accordingto the result of, and sequels to, the trialJ   forexample, in certain circumstances it might be deemedsufficient to cut off supplies of petroleum (which appeared to inflict a maximum disadvantage on Soviet
Russia with a minimum disadvantage to ourselves)rather than to include articles the exclusion ofwhich might have unfavourable reactions on ourselves.It was suggested that the exclusion of timber would have many disadvantages, while the exclusion of cotton might lead to the building up ofa Russian cotton industry.The Cabinet agreed -(a) That the Lord President of theCouncil, in the absence of the PrimeMinister, should, exercise his disere-tion to summon a meeting of cabinet ministers during the Easter Recessif he deemed this necessary and desirable having regard to theresult of the trial:(b) That Ministers who are at a greatdistance from London and to whom it would be a matter of inconvenience,should not be expected to attendunless on special request as a matterof urgency:(c) That this meeting should have authorityto take decisions both as to the issueof a Proclamation under the RussianGoods (import Prohibition) Act, 19 33,and as to what classes of goods shouldbe specified therein.-5-

ALIENSRESTRICTIONS:Admission ofGerman jewish refugees.(previous reference:Cabinet 23(33) Conclus-ion 5).F.R.p. The Cabinet had before them a Report(paper CP. 96 (33)) by the Cabinet Committeewhich had been appointed in pursuance of theCabinet Conclusion mentioned in the margin toexamine the proposals made to the Home secretary on behalf of the Jewish Community, for dealingwith the problem of the influx of Jews from germany in consequence of recent events in that country.After summarising the more important facts of the situation, and drawing attention to the grave objections involved in the adoption at the moment,either of a policy of making the present restrict-ions more severe, or of a policy of relaxing thoserestrictions in the direction desired by the BritishJewish Community, the Committee submitted thefollowing recommendations to the Cabinet:(l) That the existing arrangementsrelative to the admission andexclusion of German jewish refugees should he maintained for the time being until it is seen how the situation develops:(2) That the existing arrangements should be strengthened by theaddition to the conditionsregarding duration of visit and non-employment already required,of a further condition that therefugee should in every caseregister himself with the Policeimmediately on reaching hisdestination in the United Kingdom;(3) That the answer to the BritishJewish Authorities should be to theeffect that there can he no question at the present time of relaxing therestrictions on the entry of aliensto the United Kingdom for the benefitof German Jewish refugees.     In caseswhere such refugees had been givenpermission to land for a temporarystay, and desired to extend it, theGovernment would be prepared toconsider a further extension providedthat the Jewish Community wereprepared to guarantee, so far as might he necessary, adequate meansof maintenance for the refugeesconcerned:

This would notonly obtain for this country the advantage of their knowledge and experience, but would also create avery favourable impression in the world, particularly if our hospitality were offered with some warmth.It was suggested that perhaps the Lord President ofthe Council might be willing to consult officials and Members of such bodies as the Department of scientific and Industrial Research, the medical research Council and the Royal Society on thesematters and advise the Home Secretary and theCabinet Committee as to whether anything could bedone .While fully realising the importance of notallowing this country to be flooded with foreignrefugees who would before long either become a burden to the community or replace other workers Mhowould become a burden, the Cabinet were anxious toavoid the other danger of creating an atmospherein Europe critical to this country.
The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve generally the proposalsof the Cabinet Committee as summarised above:(b) To invite the Cabinet Committeeto consider the suggestionssummarised above for offeringthe hospitality of this country,with as much warmth as possible,to refugees from Germany whowere eminent in science, technology,art, music, etc.:(c) To approve the following reply which the Home Secretary proposedto make to a Question that wasbeing put to him the same after-noon:-&quot;The question whether a foreignerseeking admission to this countryis in a position to supporthimself and his dependantsis only one of the factors to be taken into account when deciding whether leave to land can properly begranted to him.   As I statedin reply to a question on the21st February, the interestsof this country must predominateover all other considerations,but subject to this guiding principle each case will be carefully considered on itsindividual merits and I can assure the h&apos;ono&apos;u:rable Memberthat in accordance with thetime-honoured tradition ofthis country no unnecessaryobstacles are placed in theway of foreigners seekingadmiasl on.&quot;
