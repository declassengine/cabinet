REDUCTION and limitation of armaments.Air Disarm-ament.(Previous&apos;Reference:Cabinet 13(33), Con-elusion 1,)1. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet thatthe Ministerial Committee on Disarmament, after several Meetings, had on the previous eveningreached a number of conclusions..  Those relating to naval and military disarmament conformed generally to previous decisions of the Cabinet, subject,possibly, to some variations of detail that were accepted by the Departments concerned.So far as disarmament in the air was concerned,the Prime Minister read to his colleagues a preliminar-ary draft of Conclusions arrived at on the previous evening, which the Secretary had prepared (Appendix).He explained that there had not been time to circulatethese to members of the Committee, and he muchregretted, the absence, through indisposition, of theSecretary of State for Air, to whom, of course, acopy of the draft Conclusions would be sent.After hearing the draft Conclusions, a memberof the Ministerial Committee on Disarmament pointedout that one result of Conclusion (c)(ii) (providingfor the retention in each country of a ^sanctions&quot;force of aircraft) was the necessity for providingsome air forces, not necessarily large, for navalpurposes;    otherwise part of an enemyTs  &quot;sanctions&quot;aircraft might be used for co-operation with thefleet and our Navy would have no reply.^he Prime Minister agreed that it would be inaccordance with the intentions of the ministerial committee to modify the draft Conclusions accordingly.The Prime Minister also explained that the plansrecommended for the United Kingdom Delegates tosuggest in Conclusions (c),  (d) and (e) were not inthe nature of an instruction but only to be used
on the assumption that the situation at theDisarmament Conference was favourable.    (An amend-ment to this effect has been introduced in the preamble to Conclusion (c) in the Appendix.)In reply to a question as to whether the&quot;sanctions&quot; force of aircraft was to be qualifiedin any way, the Prime Minister explained that ithad been the intention of the Committee that these aircraft should not include bombers.In reply to a request for information as towhat was intended in the matter of army co-operationaircraft, the Secretary of State-fbr War explainedthat if military aircraft were abolished the army would dispense with army co-operation machines,but otherwise the strength of these would have tobe negotiated within the limits of the air forcesremaining after the quantitative reduction referredto in (c)(iii).The Cabinet were informed that in addition tothe Conclusions and Recommendations of the ministerial Committee given in the Appendix. theMinutes of their Meeting contained a definite conclusion, reached after long discussion, -&quot;That, as a matter of principle, itwould be in the best interests ofthis country to attempt to securethe abolition of bombing from theair&quot; .The Secretary of State for India, who, though a member of the Ministerial Committee, had notbeen able to attend owing to great pressure ofwork in his own Department at the present time,was disquieted at the proposals of the ministerial committee and did not believe that they could workin practice.    In particular, he was apprehensivelest Continental States with large armies should
insist on having a proportionately large number of army co-operation machines which could, in contra-vention of the proposed Convention, be used to bombthis country,The Cabinet were reminded, in this connection,that under Conclusion (c)(iii) of the ministerial committee the total air forces of the leading AirPowers would be no greater than our own.The Prime Minister said that he and the foreign secretary, when at Geneva, would carefully bear inmind the various points that had been raised at theCabinet, and that if any point arose on which they felt that the Cabinet were doubtful they would refer the question back to London.    On this understanding the Cabinet agreed  To approve the proposals of the ministerial Committee on Disarma-ment, including the conclusions and Recommendations on Air Disarm-ament as set forth in the Appendix,. for use by the United kingdom delegates at the DisarmamentConference if the situation shouldrender this desirable.(NOTE: The amendments to the preliminary draft, suggested by members of the ministerial Committee during theMeeting, have been embodied inthe Appendix and are marked byasterisks .)
REDUCTION and limitation 0?ARMAMENTS .forthcoming visit by thePrime Ministerand foreign secretary to geneva,(previous previous reference:Cabinet 15(33) , Con-clusion 1.)2. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that he had seen the german ambassador at the latter&apos;s request.   The ambassador had informed him that the principal members of theGerman Delegation at the Disarmament conference were unable to come to Geneva to meet the PrimeMinister and himself.   The reason given was thatthey were very busy just now with internal matters and that the first possible date at which they could come was the 24th March,   The Ambassador had addedthat Baron von Neurath did not think there was muchuse in a meeting of the Heads of Delegations at thepresent time and that nothing could come out of it.The Ambassador had pointed out that there would beno fully authorised representative of the UnitedStates of America, and that Italy could not berepresented by a Foreign Minister.    The foreign secretary had told the Ambassador how gravely HisMajesty&apos;s Government would regret the absence ofthe German Chief Delegates.    It was clear that the ambassador was delivering a message from hisGovernment,   The Foreign Secretary had enquired of him whether, now that the German Election was overand the Government was established, they were likelyto drop the emergency measures .    The Ambassador had replied by referring to the experience of Italy.The measures of the Facist regime had at first beenresented, but the people had become accustomed tothem.    In saying this the Ambassador appeared tohave hinted discreetly at the relation between germany and Italy, which, as a matter of fact, was becoming increasingly obvious over a wide field.The Ambassador had pointed out that 90 per cent, ofthe population had voted at the recent Election,
that the Government was now firmly established with a Parliamentary majority and likely to remainin office for some years.The Foreign Secretary undertook to circulate a note of the conversation referred to.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said he had also received a message from Mo Boneour,who was very pleased at the prospect of a short stayby the Prime Minister and. himself in Paris.M. Boncour had expressed, in his message his firmconviction that,whatever was attempted at Geneva,co-operation from Germany could not be expected in present conditions.    The French had noticed acomplete change of attitude on the part of theGerman Frontier Guards, who up to recently had adopted a not unfriendly attitude.   The implicationof these remarks was that the German Government,havirg obtained a Parliamentary majority, felt in aposition to adopt a more.forward policy.   TheForeign Secretary added that the underlying signifi-cance of the above observations was only too clear.So far as Italy was concerned, the foreign secretary thought it possible, but not certain,that M. Aloisi would be present at Geneva, butthere was no prospect of M. Mussolini, who was hisown Foreign Minister, attending.The Prime Minister said that the situation was undoubtedly very serious, but this did not lead him. to think that it would be inadvisable tocarry out the Geneva visit .   He felt it was allthe more important for the United Kingdom to let the world know that we would leave no stoneunturned to establish peace in Europe.    He thought
also that the German refusal -would react on them,if the general situation deteriorated further.He added that he thought the Cabinet would have toleave him and the Foreign Secretary a free hand todo their best in difficult circumstances.The Cabinet, while recognising that the difficul-ties of the Prime Minister and the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs would be very great, particularly if they were met by German and Italian representativesof secondary status, accepted, the Prime Minister&apos;view that the visit ought nevertheless to take place,for the reasons he had given.    One suggestion wasthat if European countries behaved badly by notresponding to the proposal of a Meeting of Heads of delegations at Geneva they might be brought to theirbearings by a hint that we should withdraw ourselvesfrom European politics.&apos;
THE TEXTILE 3, The Cabinet had before them the followingTRADE .  documents on the subject of Japanese competitionJapaneseCompetition in the textile trade:-A Note by the President of theBoard of Trade (C.P.-55 (33))covering a Memorandum prepared in his Department and suggesting that the only conceivable remedy,so far as competition in foreing markets was concerned, would be theconclusion of a trade arrangement between the Lancashire and Japaneseexportersi it it were practicable.Competition in the Colonies, however,was a matter which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment could and should dealwith,  and in the case of West Africathere was yet time to act.   TheMemorandum, therefore suggested that,without denunciation of the Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty as such,steps should be taken on behalf ofour West African Colonies to withdraw from the Treaty in order that theyshould be in a position to withholdmost-favoured-nation treatment infuture from Japan:A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for the Colonies (CP.-54 (33))proposing that the Japanese ambassador should be informed that the pressure of public opinion in this country willmake it necessary for us to safeguard our markets here and in the Coloniesagainst Japanese competition, and that unless an agreement could be reached as to the scale of imports we shouldbe bound to denounce the Treaty, thusleaving ourselves free here and in theColonies to impose any duties against japanese goods.   At the same time hewould propose, as an alternative, anagreement by which the imports of japanese goods into the United- Kingdomand the various Colonial markets wouldbe limited to an agreed quota, basedon the average relative imports of japan and this country over a periodof years, say, five years.   Such anagreement would be better thandenouncing the Treaty, for obvious reasons.    If action on these lineswere taken by this country it wouldbe a great encouragement to Indiaand to the Dominions to treat japanese competition in the same way,   He hadalready outlined this scheme confidential -tially in a letter to the governors of all African and West Indian Colonies,the terms of which were reproduced asan Appendix to the Memorandum.colonies and in theDominionsand India,
In the course of the discussion the Secretaryof State for the Colonies pointed out that it -wouldhe extremely difficult for him, from a Parliamentarypoint of view, not to apply in the West Indies,where at the present time there was much good willtowards the United Kingdom, the same policy as in west Africa .So far as the Dominions were concerned, theCabinet were reminded that the original Treaty was between Japan and the United Kingdom, and had been extended to Dominions and Colonies.   The initiative,therefore, for withdrawal, if they so desired, wouldhave to come from the Dominions concerned.^he Cabinet were informed that Japan also hadthe right of withdrawal of the Treaty from a dominion or Colony.   Questions were raised, as towhat would be the effect of this.   The Secretary ofState for the Colonies stated that this aspect ofthe question had been examined exhaustively from acommercial point of view so far as the Colonieswere concerned, and on the whole he thought japan would lose, on balance, by withdrawing.   Malaya andong-Kong were principally affected.    In reply to aquestion he explained that it would not be prudent to suggest that Ceylon should withdraw, though itmight be that that Colony,  later on, would follow the example of others .The Secretary of State for India informed theCabinet that Japanese competition in India was extremely formidable.   Japanese imports in 1932,notwithstanding a very high Duty of 50 per cent.,had doubled as compared with 1931, though 19 31 and1932 had been bad years for the United Kingdom.The Indian position was regulated not by the Treaty
now under consideration, but by an Indo-JapaneseConvention of 1904.   The Viceroy and his Government,as well as the Chambers of Commerce, were clamouringthat this Convention should be abrogated and discrim-inatory action taken against Japan,  on the ground of depreciated Exchange.    A-y^eas&quot; would be requiredafter denunciation before the Treaty expired.   he himself, while sympathising fully with the Indianviews, had tried to moderate them, as he realised that the moment was inopportune, from a political point of view, for opening this question,   that waswhy he had not raised the matter at the Cabinet,but as it had been raised elsewhere he felt boundto make clear the importance of the Indian position.Some of the members of the Cabinet ratherfavoured the alternative idea of the Secretary ofState for the Colonies, in its application both toColonies and India, namely, that there should be anagreement by which the imports of Japanese goodswould be limited to an agreed quota.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat everyone in the Foreign Office was agreed, thatthe. Japanese inroads on our trade could not be disregarded for long, but that the present time wassingularly inopportune for raising the question.He was still in communication with the british ambassador in Tokyo and hoped to hear from him very-short ly .The Cabinet, while recognising that action could not be long delayed and that even afterwithdrawal from the Treaty a year would elapse before the withdrawal became effective, were impressed by the inopportuneness of raising the
question at the present moment &quot;before the considered views of the British Ambassador in Tokyo wereavailable.   They accordingly agreed  (a) That the question should be placedagain on the Agenda of the cabinet after an interval in any event notexceeding three weeks, or earlierif the Ministers concerned, shoulddeem advisable:(b) That the Secretary of State for theColonies should be authorised tocommunicate by Secret telegram withthe Governors of the Colonies in WestAfrica and the West Indies informing them of the line which the cabinet were now inclined to adopt (viz.,withdrawal from the Treaty byspecified Colonies) so that theymight be ready to take action assoon as a decision was reached:(e) that the President of the Board ofTrade should be authorised tointimate to the representatives ofthe Cotton Industry that the Govern-ment were very sympathetic to their case and intended to take appropriate action as soon as the international situation rendered this possible:(d) that whatever action was eventuallytaken should not be defended on theground of depreciation of Exchanges,as this would have unfortunatereactions:(e) that the possibility of retaliationby Japan should be further examined,both in Its political and commercialaspects, by the Ministers concernedbefore the matter is again raised atthe Cabinet.
4.       The Cabinet had before them a Note by theMinister of Health (C.P.-51 (33)) covering a Circularwhich he proposed to send to Local Authorities on those recommendations of the Ray Committee on local expenditure which directly concerned the Ministryof Health,   The Report of the Committee containedvarious suggestions for better and more carefuladministration which he proposed to commend to LocalAuthorities;    and the Circular, in addition t.o general guidance, stressed the need for new developments in health provision, indicated that these could andshould be financed out of savings, and traversedcertain views expressed by the Committee adverse tothe Mental Deficiency Service,Discussion concentrated mainly on the paragraphat the top of Page 8 (last paragraph of Chapter VI(b)(1) of the Draft Circular), in which were summarised the principles which ought to govern the economicaladministration of Poor Relief.      In particular, doubts were expressed as to the expediency of the following passage at the end of the paragraph -    &quot;       thetherequirement of work as a condition of out-relief to/abled-bodied is an economy - the practice of offering,In appropriate cases, institutional instead of outrelief should be revived and extended&quot;.It was explained that the reason for the insertion of this paragraph in a document dealing with theReport of the Committee on Local Expenditure was toemphasise the importance of economic administration and in addition to sum up principles which would be useful to have on record, even when the new schemefor the administration of transitional benefit and relief, now under consideration, came into operation.- 11 -
9 9 9  6 aIn view of the doubts expressed as to thepolitical expediency of including this paragraph theMinister of Health decided to withdraw it and to rely on the previous short paragraph, expanded as necessary.Doubts were also expressed as to the desirabilityof including a short paragraph in the middle of Page 1oft. the Draft Circular, calling attention to a recommen-dation that there should be an examination by a SpecialBody of a system of block grants to Local Authoritiesin respect of all Exchequer aided local services.It was suggested that an alteration of the presentsystem might involve loss  to the Exchequer from thepoint of view of education.      On the whole, however,taking into consideration other services included In the block grants as well as education It was not considered necessary to withdraw these paragraphs.In regard to the remarks at the foot of Page of the Draft Circular on paragraph 240 of the Report ofthe Committee on Local Expenditure, it was suggested thatan addition might with advantage be made in accordancewith recent statements in the House of Commons by theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Health.The latter, however, thought that this was unnecessary,as Local Authorities would fully realise that therecommendations of the Report were superseded by therecent pronouncements.A general observation was that the Report had tobe considered very carefully from the point of view ofthe new system of administration of transitional benefit and relief, now under consideration by the Government.Having regard to the conflict between the aspectsof economic administration and political considerartions the Cabinet agreed:-
(a) That the circular should he examined in detail by a Committee composedof -The Lord President of the Council,The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs,The Minister of Health.(b) That the paragraph at the head of Page 8of the Draft Circular should be deleted,and that such addition as might be deemed necessary and desirable should be madeto the preceding paragraph.
5.       The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe President of the Board of Trade (C.P.-56 (33))circulating for the consideration of his colleaguesa Note by the Secretary for Mines  on the subjectof the Miners&apos; Welfare Fund, and asking authorityfor the Secretary for Mines to make a statement to the effect that the Government agree generally with the findings of the Inquiry Committee (Cmd.4236(1933)) and that as soon as Parliamentary businesspermits legislation will be introduced, which will include a provision for the reduction of the outputlevy to a halfpenny, commending (retrospectively)with the levy for 1932, and for its extension fora period of 20 years .The proposal to include provision for thereduction of the output levy to a half-penny to commence retrospectively, in other words, for the levy to be reduced in anticipation Of legislation,was felt to provide a dangerous precedent, and analternative proposal that the penny levy might bemade by the Bill to apply for two years was preferred.The Cabinet agreed:-To approve the proposal of the Presidentof the Board of Trade subject to thepenny levy being made to apply in theBill for two years.
90gTHE ROAD 6t The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum byTRAFFICACT, 1930. the Minister of Transport (C.P.-47 (33))  on theExtent of subject of the extent of the application of SectionApplicationof Section 116 of the Road Traffic Act, 1930, relating to116, relatingto Compensation. Compensation, in which he asked authority tointroduce a Bill repealing the obligation put upon(previous reference: the Road Fund arising from the fact that the SectionCabinet 33(30), Con- was made to apply to the whole Act and not limitedelusion 4.)FAto Part P7* and conferring no rights of compensationupon the Staff affected by agreements under Part Vof the Act J but providing that the liability uponthe Road Fund should not be removed retrospectively,i,e,, in respect of any agreement entered into(and, where approval is necessary, approved) beforethe date of the introduction of the Bill.To meet a criticism by the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs, the Minister of transportundertook to consider the possibility of insertinga provision in the Bill which would have the effectof imposing upon the Local Authority concerned an obligation to pay to any of its employees affectedby agreements entered into under Section 105 ofthe Road Traffic Act, 1930, the same compensation which any such employees would be entitled to obtain from the Road Fund under Section 116 as it now stands,Subject to the above, the cabinet approved the proposals of theMinister of Transport.
GLASGOW0 ORPORA^ IONAllegedBribery andCorruptionin.ProposedInquiryunder theTribunalsof Inquiry(Evidence)Act, 1921.7.    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe secretary of State for Scotland (C.P.-57 (S3))stating that in recent years representations hadbeen made to a number of Ministers, and in the Press,to the effect that corrupt practices were takingplace in the conduct of municipal business in glasgow, and that after careful consideration ofall the circumstances he had reached the conclusion,in consultation with the Lord Advocate, that therewas now sufficiently definite subject-matter ofurgent public importance to justify the appointmentof a Tribunal under the tribunals of Inquiry(Evidence) Act, 1921, to inquire into the allegation-tions.   The Secretary of State asked authority to announce,  in reply to a Parliamentary Question,that steps were to be taken to appoint a Tribunal,,and added that, in accordance with the terms of theAct, a Resolution would be necessary in both houses of Parliament that it is expedient that a mribunalshould be established.The Secretary of State for Scotland informed .the Cabinet that he was considering, the question of whether it would be expedient to indemnify witnesseswho were selected to give evidence.The view was expressed that the inquiry shouldbe a strong one.The Cabinet approved the recommendationof the Secretary of State for Scotland.

AIR DISARMAMENT.SUMMARY OP CONCLUSIONS AND RE00MME1NTDA-TI0.N5 OF THE MINISTERIAL COMMITTEE on disarmament.NOTE: Amendments to the preliminary draft,made during the Cabinet Meeting, aremarked by asterisks .(a) Among the serious results which would follow a failure of the Disarmament Conference wouldbe the re-armament of Germany, including thecreation of a military air force on anunrestricted scale.   This would be highly dangerous both to the peace of Europe and the safety of the British Empire.    Among themeasures for averting the breakdown of theConference, international restriction ofmilitary and naval aviation takes a high place.(b) The total abolition of military and navalaviation is generally recognised to dependon effective measures to prevent the use ofcivil aircraft for military and naval purposes in time of wa^ ,   To the United Kingdom, owingto the exposed position of London and the unfavourable conditions, compared with Contin-ental countries, for the development internallyof civil aviation, this latter consideration isof particular interest.    Investigation, both inLondon and at Geneva, has as yet failed toproduce any scheme that could be relied on intime of war to prevent the use of civil aircraft for military and naval purposes , and in particularas bombers .   Consequently the total abolition of.military air forces is not practicable and other methods have had to be considered.(e) The plan recommended for the United kingdom delegates to suggest,*assuming that the situation at the Disarmament Conference is favourable ,is as follows:-(i) ^he abolition of bombing aircraft and bombing from the air, apart from the useof s\ioh machines as are necessary for police purposes, as set  out in theDeclaration of the United Kingdom&apos;policy dated November 17,  19 32.(ii) The retention in each country of a&quot;sanctions&quot; force of airci-aft to combatthe possible misuse in time of war,contrary to the Convention?., of civil aircraft as bombers .   *This necessitatesalso the provision of some air forces,     ^not necessarily large, for naval purposes  .APPEND I y.
(iii) A quantitative reduction of Air Forcesin accordance with the suggestioncontained in the Declaration of theUnited Kingdom&apos;s Policy dated november 17, 1932, viz.:- (1) theimmediate reduction of the air forcesof the leading Powers to the level ofthose of the United&apos; Kingdom;    (2)  a cut of 3373 per cent, all round onthe air forces of the world thusreduced, United Kingdom included;(3) a limitation of the unladen weight of military aircraft to the lowest figure upon which generalagreement can be obtained.(iv) Civil aviation to be controlled inaccordance with the proposals ofthe Air Ministry (Annex).(d) In the event of a rejection of the proposals in (c) by the Disarmament Conference it is recommended that the United Kingdom Dele-gates should propose the following alterna-tive plan: -(1) An international prohibition ofthe bombing of centres of the civilian population.(ii)  Quantitative reduction of airforces as set forth in (c)(iii)above.(iii)  Control of civil aviation as inthe Annex.(e) If the Disarmament Conference is unwilling to accept any of the above proposals the United Kingdom Delegates are recommended to fall back on a quantitative reductionof Air Forces as in (c)(iii) above.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.March 8, 1933.

The effect of these proposals would be to establish,,.under the direction of the League, a complete internationalregister of all civil aircraft - comparable to the registers of shipping at present maintained by Lloyd&apos;sand similar organisations..11.    Civil Aviation Personnel.The   High Contracting Parties agree that they will not-iv-
require civil aviation enterprises to employ personnel speciallytrained for military purposed, and that they will notprescribe the training of civil aviation personnel in military duties.III.
