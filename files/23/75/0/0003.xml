,    The Cabinet had before them a Most SecretINSURANCE. Memoranda by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP.-10(Previous (33)) on the subject of the Unemployment InsuranceCabinetC61        Committee,, which had been constituted to consider theolSsion04&quot;)       future of Unemployment Insurance and of assistanceffc for the unemployed outside insurance and to frame9fea)t. recommendations.   A difference of opinion had arisen in the Committee on certain important questions ofprinciple, and until the views of the Cabinet had been ascertained the Committee did not feel that they could usefully carry their discussions further.   The proposalsof the Chancellor of the Exchequer involved the settingup of a Statutory Commission to administer relief, andcontemplated the transference to that Commission of theduties now falling on the Public Assistance committee as regards domiciliary relief (except medical attention and treatment) and the duties of the Minister of labour with respect to transitional payments.   The Minister ofLabour held the view that these proposals raised mostserious constitutional and political issues, in thatthey involved the withdrawal of Parliamentary and ministerial control over the expenditure of at least 50,000,000 or  60,000,000 a year, and also deprivedMembers of the House of Commons of the right to call inquestion the treatment of their constituents by theproposed Commission.   He also offered various criticismsin detail.   In the Memorandum the Chancellor of theExchequer set forth the possible alternative solutionsif the Statutory Commission was rejected, although theCabinet was not asked to pronounce on any of them.   Hee added that the Secretary of State for Scotland had made proposals intended to meet the special circumstances ofScotland, and that the best method of dealing with theScottish problem would be considered by the Committee-1-
when the Cabinet had decided the question of principleraised in his Memorandum.After the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theMinister of Labour had developed in detail theirrespective points of view, the Cabinet discussed thepoint; at issue in its constitutional, political,Parliamentary, financial and administrative aspects.There was general agreement that the presentposition of Unemployment Insurance and relief as affecting the unemployed outside insurance was unsatisfactory, and that some drastic changes were necessary,   but the Cabinet were not prepared todecide the principle at issue without furtherinformation and reflection, -While the discuseion centred mainly on the largeconstitutional and $political issue raised in C,P,-10(33), Paragraph 9, other important points emerged.One of these points was the proposal in theChancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s Memorandum to transfer to the Statvitory Commission the duties now falling on the Public Assistance Cewmittees as regardsdomiciliary relief (except medical attention and treatment) and the duties of the Minister of labour with respect to transitional payments .    Evidence wasadduced to show that the administration of these services resulted in unequal treatment in differentlocalities and consequent discontent, strained the finances of Local Authorities in depressed areas,and entailed such severe pressure on those elected members of Local Councils involved in public ass ist-ance as to threaten a shortage of suitable candidates for such bodies, and a consequential deterioration oflocal government in many districts.The Cabinet were impressed by the seriousness ofthis aspect of the question, but the Minister of Labour,-2-
for the reasons given in paragraph 12 of CP.-10 (33),was most reluctant to agree that the Public AssistanceCommittees should be dispensed with.On the question of the financial responsibilityof Parliament, explanations given by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer and the Minister of Health went fartowards satisfying the Cabinet that the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer&apos;s scheme fulfilled the main conditionsof House of Commons responsibility for finance, viz.,retention of initiative of the House of Commons:    the voting of public moneys on Departmental Estimates(including Supplementary Estimates), appropriation,and audit.    It was also shown that ample opportunities for debate, both on the policy aid the administrationof the Statutory Commission, would be provided.In this connection the Cabinet were informed that itwas proposed that the Statutory Commission should furnish an Annual Report, and, in addition, that, witha view to establishing a right Parliamentary outlooktowards the Commission, this Report should be subjected to examination by a Select Committee before it was discussed in the House of Commons .-^he principal point on which further consideration was felt to be necessary was the question of Ministerialauthority.    It was recognised that there were practicaldisadvantages in any system under which a stream of questions on individual cases of supposed hardship ormaladministration could be directed daily in the Houseof Commons to the Ministers concerned, especially assuch  &apos;under a system Members of Parliament    we&quot;re      unableto resist pressure from their constituents to put those questions.    On the other hand, it was suggested that theremoval of an expenditure of  50,000,000 or  60,000,000a year from the administrative responsibility of --3-
The Cabinet agreed  To invite the Cabinet Committee to addressitself once more to the problem of Minis-terial responsibility in the light of theCabinet discussion, and to submit a second report on the subject containing, inter alia,information on the above points with a viewto further discussion by the Cabinet.system.    If a democratic system was to survive it mustfind means to cope with its difficulties withoutdevolving on outside organisations the responsibilityfor vitally important services.    &quot;Ministerial responsi-bility is the price of Parliamentary government&quot;.In order to enable the Cabinet to pursue its deliberations on this important constitutional andpolitical aspect of the question it was suggested that further information was required as to the composition and functions of the Statutory Commission and its relations to Ministers and Parliament.    In particular,it was suggested that information should be given onthe following questions:-(.1) What will be the size of the StatutoryC ommiss ion?(s) Will the Government or the statutory commission decide, within the limits of the Statute, such questions as thescale of relief and the conditions of relief (e.g., Means Test)?(S) In the event of a change in Unemployment-(e.g,, a substantial rise or fall in thefigures), will the Government or theStatutory Commission initiate any consequential changes in policy ora dmin is t ra t i on?(4) Is the Government or the statutory commission to work out the methods forre-conditioning the unemployed -bearing in mind that, while everything possible should be done in this respectsafeguards must be provided against two&quot;&quot;dangers, viz.:- (i) such over-expenditure as to break down our industrial system;and (ii) making unemployment too populart(5) Will there be Local Commissions underthe Statutory Commission?
