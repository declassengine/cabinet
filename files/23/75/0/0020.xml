3 1 iHE ARMY&quot; ANDIR FORCEIANNUAL) BILL,previous reference:Cabinet 19(32), Con-clusion 8.)ii (iii) (f.l.The Cabinet had before them a Memorandtum bythe Secretary of State for War (CP.-68 (35))covering the draft Army and Air Force (Annual) Bill.The Memorandum stated that there were no amendments to the Army Act, but the Air Force Act had been amended to provide -(l) that when any body of the Royal AirForce is acting with any body of theIndian Air Force, a member of the oneForce may, by regulations to be madeby the Air Council and the Governor-General, be given the powers of commandover members of the other Force whichhe would, have had if he were a memberof the other Force of relative rank:and(2) that officers or airmen of the IndianAir Force, when attached to the Royal &apos;Air Force outside India, shall besubject to the Air Force Act, subjectto exceptions to be laid down in regu-lations made by the Air Council andthe Governor-General.The Memorandum pointed out that the Bill must receivethe Royal Assent by the end of April, and that thisyear it was necessary that it should pass through allthe stages before Easter,   The Secretary of Statetherefore asked the concurrence of his colleagues inthe immediate circulation of the Bill.The Secretary of State for India said that theGovernment of India could contract out of the arrange-ment if they should think it necessary, but he hopedthat this would not be the case.    Subject to this he agreed in the proposal.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the immediate circulation of the draft Army and Air Force (Annual)Bill:(b) That the War Office should be given theopportunity of considering any regula-tions for the exercise of mutual powersof command between the Royal Air Forceand the Indian Air Force before theyare made   in case they should prejudice the Army&apos;s position.
2. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Home Secretary (C.P.-69 (33)) on the subject ofthe 10 per cent, cut in Police Pay, in which he proposed that the existing practice of making the economy cut for a period of twelve months   a practicepeculiar to the Police-should be discontinued and thatthe cut should be imposed without an express time limit.The Home Secretary considered that the change of practice now proposed should be made when the police council meets early in April to consider the recommenda-tions of the Higgins Committee on the Pay of all new entrants to the Police.   This course would alsoiprovide an early opportunity of informing the police council of the Government&apos;s intention to continue the10 per cent, cut in Police pay after September next.The Home Secretary said that he proposed to make clear that the 10 per cent. cut to the Police wasto be on the same footing as for all other servicesof the Crown, and would be dealt with as and when theGovernment deal with the question of cuts as a whole.The Cabinet approved the proposal ofthe Home Secretary as set forth in cp,-69 (33) and summarised above.

the GOAL MINES 3, The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum byirw   1930.&apos;     the President of the Board of Trade (C.P.-67 (33))part Ioon the subject of Part I of the Coal Mines Act, 1930[previous In his Memorandum the President stated that he was reference:Cabinet 28       satisfied that the Schemes in force under Part I of(32), Con-elusion 8.)      the Act must be maintained in operation.   By the CoalMines Act, 1932, the life of the Schemes was extended for five years, on the implied condition that theywould be amended in those respects which experience had shown to be necessary.    So far the coalowners,largely owing to the opposition of certain districts,had been unable to secure the majority requisite forthe submission for approval of amendments to theCentral Scheme.    It was essential that the CentralScheme should be amended to permit of separate outputallocations for the export trade, in order to free that trade from qtiantitative control, and that there shouldbe inter-district co-ordination of minimum prices.In view of the urgency of the matter he had informed the Chairman of the Central Council of Coalowners that unless by the middle of April the Council submittedamendments of the Central Scheme dealing with thesematters he would have no alternative but to recommendthat the Government should introduce legislation togive the Board of Trade general powers of amendment ofthe Central Scheme in order that these two amendmentsmight be made.   The President wished to know that hiscolleagues concurred in the action he had taken andthat they were prepared to authorise him to make anannouncement in the House of Commons on the above linesThe President of the Board of Trade pointed outthat his proposals had an important bearing on thenegotiations with Norway, Sweden and Denmark.   Thecoalowners were ready to give an undertaking to supply
the ooal required in these countries, but could notbe sure of being able to fulfil their orders unlessthe proposed amendments to the Central Scheme were adopted.   This was quite well-known to the Scandinaviannegotiators, and it was important to reassure themby clearing up the point as soon as possible.    In thecourse of the discussion he mentioned that he did notapprehend notices of a stoppage being handed in inSouth Wales, largely owing to the effect of a speechmade by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.The Cabinet agreed  To approve the proposals of thePresident of the Board of trade as set forth in C.P.-67 (55)and summarised above.
ItHE RUBBER 4.  The Cabinet had before them a Note by the&apos; -INDUSTRY , f     ^BILL. President of the Board of Trade (C.P.-71 (33)) covering a Memorandum prepared in the Board of Trade on the: (previous reference:        subject of the Rubber Industry Bill.   The Bill, which cabinet 52(33), Con-       was a Private Member&apos;s Bill, was not likely to makeelusion and Appendix.)further progress unless it could be adopted by theI   fR,Government.    It authorised the Research Association ofBritish Rubber Manufacturers to collect a smallstatutory levy on all raw rubber used in manufacture in the United Kingdom, the proceeds of which would beapplied to research.    If the Bill was not passed into law before the end of the Session there would be no alternative but the closing down of the ResearchAssociation.   The President of the Board of Tradetherefore suggested that if the Bill were adopted bythe Government it should be introduced forthwith inthe Rouse of Lords, where discussion might disclose the grounds on which any opposition to the Bill was based.Doubts were expressed as to whether there was muchenthusiasm in the rubber industry for the Bill, or asto the value of the research carried out by the research Association compared with what was being doneby the larger firms themselves.    It was felt, however,that the result of introducing the Bill in the Houseof Lords would be to ascertain what the real feeling was in the matter and whether it was worth while toproceed with the Bill in the House of Commons.The Secretary of State for War, as Leader of theHouse of Lords, raised the question as to whether, inview of the extent to which this Bill was concernedwith finance, it could properly be introduced in theHouse of Lords.   Apart from this he had no objection.-5-
Subject to enquiry by the Presidentof the Board of Trade on this point the Cabinet approved the introduction in the House of Lords of the RubberIndustry Bill.
SURVEY. Minister of Health (C.P.-72 (33)) covering thefollowing draft Motion to be moved by Dr.W.H.Mcleanon Civil Estimates:-&quot;That, in the opinion of this House,it would be advantageous to prepare a National Development Survey toassist the Government and localauthorities in estimating the effectof the prevailing social and economictendencies on the nature and extentof the development for which localauthorities should provide in theirschemes under the Town and country planning Act of 1932;    and also toassist the Government in taking any action in the light of these tenden-cies which may bo necessary toco-ordinate and promote the tradeand other developments of the country under private enterprise&quot;.The Note stated that the Motion was almost sure to be debated, and the Minister of Health suggested that heshould -(a) express general sympathy with the object&apos;(b) point out that the surveys and investiga-tions needed for present action are beingmade continuously by Government departments and the various special inquiries whichthe Government has in being;(c) say that the wider inquiries which theresolution contemplates and which arenot needed for present action may beleft till less arduous times .The Minister of Health Informed the Cabinetthat he had received from the President of the Boardof Trade a Memorandum, which was very enlightening, onaspects of a National Development Survey rather wider than those in which the Ministry of Health were con-cerned.    In the circumstances he thought it possiblethat the Board of Trade might like to deal with the motion.The Cabinet- agreed  That the Minister of Health should consult Dra W.H.McLean as to theaspects of a National DevelopmentSurvey which he proposed to raisein Debate, after which the Ministerof Health and the President of the
Board of Trade should arrange forthe Parliamentary Under-Secretaryof one or other Department to actas spokesman for the Government.

The Cabinet had under consideration the following bills to be introduced in the House of Commons by private Members on Friday, March 24th:-The Solicitors (Scotland) Bill,The Trout (Scotland) Bill,The Banditry Bill.The Secretary of State for Scotland informed theCabinet that the two Scottish Bills were harmless.The Home Secretary informed his colleagues thatthe Banditry Bill was not a useful measure.The Lord President of the Council thought it possible that the House would rise early on thedate on which these Bills were to be introduced.

The Cabinet took note of a Memorandum bythe President of the Board of Trade (C.P.-70 (33))cireulating for the information of his colleaguesa Memorandum by the Secretary for Mines on thesubject of the Meeting of Governments at geneva on February 20th to discuss the draft international convention on Miners&apos; Hours.The President of the Board of Trade informed the Cabinet that the proceedings at Geneva had worked out almost exactly as he had forecast.InternationalConventionlimiting Honrsof Work.

He had received repliesCabinet 15(35), Con- from nearly all these Colonies, and in most cases theyelusion 3.)accepted, his suggestions with enthusiasm.The Secretary of State for India thought it probablethat the reply of India would be that they wished towithdraw from the Indo-Japanese Convention of 1904.He understood, however, that the question would beraised in the near future.
099ts ifj hiINDIA.9.   The Secretary of State for India informedConstitutional the Cabinet that the reception of the White PaperReforms .had been better in India than he had anticipated.The White-Paper,(^previous reference:Cabinet 19133), Con-elusion 1.)The Liberals had not taken advantage of the opportunityto repudiate It and go over to Congress.    Sir Tej Sapruhad criticised the White Paper, but had made clear thatthere was no question of non-cooperation.    It looked,therefore, as though the Indians would respond to the invitation to come to London.   The Moslems appeared tohave no great objection,   mhe Viceroy was not dissatis-fied.    One of the Princes was making difficulties, butit had never been expected that the Princes could reach a final decision until they saw the Bill.    mhe reception of the White Paper in this country also had been betterthan he had anticipated.   Referring to the draft Motion,he said that after the Meeting of the Cabinet mentionedin the margin, where it had been discussed, he had seen the Speaker of the Kouse of Commons, who had admitted that the Government could put the Motion down if they wished.    The Motion had been well received, and theConservative opposition had come to the conclusionthat they could not put down an amendment to it, and,as the Lord President added, had intimated that theywould not stand out of the Joint Select Committee ifthey were adequately represented.-IS-
IbuCTlON ANDJflTATlON troops ,,,&apos;jie d i s a rmaro. en tConference.If Previous: Reference:Cabinet 18i (33), Con-; elusion 1.)Visit toItaly.The State ofKir ope.(The Prime Minister and the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs enteredat this point, having arrived by airfrom Paris .)10.   The Prime Minister made a statement to theCabinet as to the visit which he had paid, in company with the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs, to theDisarmament Conference at Geneva and to Rome,At Geneva they had found a very bad position.The various problems were being dealt with each in isolation by different Committees and Sub-Committees,no-one seeing what was the whole commitment.    It had become plain, therefore, that if the Conference wasto be saved and the position of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentjustified, it was necessary to produce a comprehensivedocument.    After taking this decision it had become more and more clear that it would be unavoidable toproduce figures, which they had done with some reluctant-tance.    It had also become clear that the first effectof&apos;producing figures would be to cause irritationbut that we should gain respect, since someone at somepoint had to shoulder this burden.    He had anticipated,however, that the annoyance would pass and that the respect would continue; and this appeared to be what had happened.    Originally the disarmament plan was tohave been examined at Geneva on Thursday, March 23rd,but he had heard on the previous day that Mr Henderson &apos;,the President of the Disarmament Conference, had decidedto invite the General Commission to adjourn theConference until after Easter, probably April 25th.There was a danger that if the matter was not handledwisely, the Conference, in considering the draftConvention, would drift back to the old position.The proper course appeared to be for the DisarmamentConference to sit, as the House of Commons does, as a
Committee of the whole House. He had felt somewhatuncertain after reaching the decision to launch thedraft Convention, hut now he was well satisfied.Reverting to the visit to Italy, the Prime ministers aid that, shortly after their arrival in Geneva,information had arrived from various quarters that signor Mussolini was putting out soundings as towhether they were willing to visit Rome, and had intimated that he had some ideas to discuss withthem.    On arrival at Rome they had found that Signorpp        Mussolini had formed the idea of the four great3b(33)U-   Western Powers (the United Kingdom, Prance, Italy andGermany) getting together to secure the peace ofEurope for at least ten years .    Signor Mussoliniconsidered the peace in jeopardy unless the,Treatyof Versailles was revised.   He had referred moreparticularly to the revision of the Polish Corridor,but had mentioned more vaguely the question of Hungary.He&apos; had made clear that he was strongly opposed toGermany re-arming.   That, it was true, did not quitecorrespond to Article III of the Italian proposal(Rome Telegram No. 50, of March 18th) which providedfor the method by which, in the event of the Disarma-ment Conference leading only to partial results,Germany was to obtain parity.    Signor Mussolini had made clear that he wanted his plan worked within thespirit of the League of Nations.    He was anxious for peace and had. said plainly that no country in Europecould afford to indulge in war,  or ought to indulge in war at the present time.   All had great internalproblems to deal with, and should, combine to establishconfidence and tranquility, so that each could turn to its own affairs.    mhe Prime Minister added thatthe story he had seen in the Press that he had
expressed willingness to cede British Colonies toGermany was totally untrue.    Colonies had only been mentioned in the vague reference to them in Article 17of the Italian plan, and he and the Foreign secretary had been at pains to get the reference deleted.He and his colleague had been careful to give nothingaway and to incur no commitment.   The only point atwrhich they had got on the margin of a commitment wasin the first part of the draft Convention submittedto the Disarmament Conference, but this was contingent on the co-operation of the United States of Americaand was perfectly safe4   At Rome they had listened,asked questions, and, without committing themselvesin the slightest degree, had suggested that ifSignor Mussolini wanted, his ideas considered favour-ably he should make certain alterations.    He had made clear that the question had to be discussedfirst with the French Government on their way home,and then the Cabinet, and that they were entering into no commitment pending these consultations.They had also made it clear that the four powers could not impose themselves on the rest of Europe.Any other country concerned in anyway wouldhave to be called into consultation.In Paris the French Government had been toldplainly that the present position could not be held for ever .The Prime Minister added one interesting remarkthat Signor Mussolini had made:   &apos;&quot;All Treaties areholy,, but no Treaty is eternal&quot;.   That was the frame of mind in which he approached the problem.
The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs didnot wish to add much to the Prime Minister&apos;s accountof what had happened.   He emphasised, however,  thatthe visit to Rome had definitely checked the tendency for Europe to divide itself into two camps.   the visit had also given the utmost satisfaction to theItalians.    Signor Mussolini had aligned himself with us in a way which would make it difficult for him to go over to the Germans, and that had beenespecially emphasised by our Ambassador in Rome.Signor Mussolini&apos;s plan, though conceived in theinterest of peace, offered certain opportunities toItaly to obtain advantage.Referring to Geneva, the Secretary of State sailthat the Prime Minister had made a tremendousimpression and had raised British prestige to thehighest point.   He was satisfied, therefore, that whatever was the ultimate fate of the draft Convention,the visit could not result in our discomfiture.The result of including the figures had been thatthe whole Conference pricked tip its ears and feltthat business was being done.    Even the german delegation, which, it had been feared, might evenrun out, had recognised the practical importance of figures ,   Mo Delegation had left in dudgeon, and, sofar as he had heard, the only objection to thefigures had been taken by the Turks, on the ground thatthey had not been included among, the States of Europe.He endorsed what the Prime Minister had said as to no commitment having been entered into.In Paris, the Secretary of State added, he andthe Prime Minister had emphasised two dangers to theFrench:    (l) that Germany, in furtherance of heradmitted equality of rights, might start to re-arm:
(S) that she might take up the revision of peace treaties, as provided for in Article XIX of the Covenant.Was it not worth while, therefore, considering anarrangement by which the Powers, including Italy andGermany, should consider the mode of treatment ofthese problems?    The French had not given a definite answer.   They had shown some anxiety on the groundthat any quadruple arrangement of the kind put them in difficulties with Poland and the Little Entente.   signor mussolini, however, had made clear that he would not recognise the Little Entente as a Power,The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, inthe course of his statement, said that at a meeting ofthe Disarmament Conference at Geneva on the morrow therepresentative of the United Kingdom would make clearthat we had been quite willing to proceed with thediscussion of the draft Convention but would consent to an adjournment if generally desired.The Prime Minister gave some evidence of the closeunderstanding between Italy and Germany, and emphasisedhow important it was that this proposal had been madeby Signor Mussolini and not by Herr Hitler,   He agreed with the Foreign Secretary that the division of Europeinto two camps had been averted.   One of the problems that lay before us now was to avoid the isolation ofFrance.   He gave a number of illustrations of the extraordinary regeneration of Italy under the Fascistregime. - a regeneration which affected not only theefficiency of the whole administration and system ofgovernment but had resulted in a widespread spiritualdevelopment among the Italian people.   He had tried tobring home to M. Daladier (whom he had found exceptionallypleasant to deal with)- the realities of the situationand the importance of France coming into line with the-17-
other Great Powers.   He felt that the situation wasfull of danger.   We might make some move at Genevawhich would result in isolating Prance;    or, bysticking too closely to Prance, we might run into anopposite danger.    The greatest service we could renderto Prance at the moment was to get her to realise whatwas going on in Europe outside her own country.   mhatwas his impression of the problem of our Europeanpolicy in a nutshell.The Prime Minister thought that the best plan forpursuing this matter would be as follows:-(l) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should prepare a Report, for theinformation of Signor Mussolini, on theresults of the Paris Conversations:(2) That the Secretary of State for- ForeignAffairs should circulate his views andrecommendations to the Cabinet:(3) That any approach to the German Govern-ment should for the moment be left to signor Mussolini:(4) That a small group of Ministers shouldstudy the problem and make recommenda-tions to the Cabinet,The Cabinet offered their warm congratulations to the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary on theresults of their visit.    It was realised that,although a new set of problems now presented themselves, thiswas an advantage compared with the old problems, whichhad proved well-nigh insoluble.
I    RUSSIA.Anglo-soviet relations ,firrest ofBritishSubjects .(previous reference:Cabinet 18(33), Con-clusion 2.)11. At the outset of the Meeting copies of aMemorandum by the Permanent Under-Secretary of State,Foreign Office (G.P.-78 (33)), were handed to theCabinet, giving an account of the present positionfollowing the arrest of Metropolitan-Vickers employeesby the Soviet Government.    After describing the stepsso far taken and the means of pressure on the SovietGovernment, to be applied progressively, as suggestedby Sir E. Ovey, the Permanent Under-Secretary of Statemade the following recommendations:-That in the unlikely event of the prisoners being shot, we shouldbreak off all relations and bringSir E. Ovey home;That in the more probable event ofthere being a trial and an adverseverdict, followed by either releaseor a light sentence, we should - decline to renew commercial negotiations;That in the now still more unlikely event of the early release of the prisoners we should drive an evenharder commercial bargain than weshould otherwise have attempted.In the course of a discussion of a preliminary character some doubts were expressed as to the wisdom of rejecting the advice of Sir E. Ovey, more particu-larly as he was on the spot and we were not dealingwith a people of ordinary - mentality .   It was suggested as being one of those cases where the views of theman on the spot were of special importance.   It wasalso suggested that there was a real risk that publicopinion in this country might demand much strongermeasures than were at present contemplated.&apos; While a good deal of dotibt was expressed as to the advisability of threatening or adopting a breach of diplomatic relations, which were always difficult to restore, two suggestions were made for puttingpressure on the Russian Soviet Government, viz.,
(l) to stop all export credits, and (2) to prohibit the import of Russian goods after the expiration ofthe existing Trade Agreement on April 17th.The President of the Board of Trade informed hiscolleagues that when these difficulties with Russiaarose he had put himself in communication with the firms concerned in export credits and had advised themto proceed slowly in carrying out their orders.   Theresult was that no exports to Russia of such goods were taking place at this moment.    As to the proposedprohibition of imports, the Cabinet were reminded that Sir E. Ovey had already been instructed to bring to the notice of M. Litvinoff the power of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to impose prohibitions on Soviet imports.Towards the end of the Meeting the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs read telegram No. 91, of the22nd March, which had arrived by telephone during theMeeting from Sir E. Ovey, indicating, inter alia, thatthe Soviet Government are now at last aware of the seriousness of His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s attitude.In view of the fact that the Prime Minister and secretary of State for Foreign Affairs had onlyreturned during the Meeting from Paris, and that thelatter had had no opportunity to inform himself ofthe situation sufficiently fully to give consideredadvice to his colleagues, the Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should communicateat once, and if possible by telephone,with His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in moscow, not rejecting his proposals but mentioning some of the objectionsto them, and asking what he thoughtwould be the effect of taking powersto stop all imports from Russ&apos;ia afterApril 17th and of stopping export credits to Rvissia:(b) That the Cabinet should meet again at p.m. the same evening in the
Prime Minister&apos;s Room at theHouse of Commons, and that theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs should advise them asto the course to he adopted.(NOTE: It was realised that several members of the Cabinet wouldprobably be unable to be present, owing to engagementsin Parliament and otherwise.)2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,March 22, 1935,
