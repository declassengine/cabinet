THE BRITISH.jtfAR DEBT TOepHE UNITEDSTATES OEAMERICA,(previous reference:Cabinet 68(32), Con-clusion 3.)1. The Cabinet had before them telegrams exchanged between the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs and the British Ambassador at Washington on thesubject of the proposed negotiations for the discussionof the British War Debt to the United States ofAmerica (Telegrams Nos , 31 and 32 from Sir R. Lindsay,received January 21, 1933, and telegram No.37 toSir R. Lindsay despatched January 24, 1933).The Prime Minister, the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave the Cabinet full information as to the progress ofthis question.The Cabinet agreed  That the Prime Minister, the lord president of the Council, theChancellor of the Exchequer, theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs and the President of theBoard of Trade should keep intoiich with one another on thisquestion and confer with the british ambassador at Washington on his arrival in London next week.(NOTE:    The Secretary was instructed toprepare a summary of the state-ments made at the Cabinet on thissubject, and, after circulatingit to the Prime Minister, the lord president of the Council, theChancellor of the Exchequer andthe Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs for correction and initialsto keep a single copy with thestandard file &quot;of Cabinet Minutes,)t
2.   The Secretary of State for the Coloniesraised as a matter of urgency a question relating tothe recent Ordinance Issued in connection with the discovery of gold in the Native Reserves in KenyaColony.   The Government&apos;s case on this question, he explained, was a very strong one, which had the supportof everyone in Kenya and was not seriously challenged by persons with knowledge of the conditions.   the ordinance had been issued last December, with theapproval of the Governor of the Colony.   One formalityremained, namely, for the Secretary of State for theColonies to intimate that Eis Majesty did not disallowthe Ordinance,   Normally this intimation would be given at once.    there was, however, to be a Debate in theHouse of Lords on the subject on February 8th, and thequestion arose as to whether the intimation should beheld up until after the Debate.On balance, the Cabinet came to the conclusionthat it would be inadvisable to suspend action owingto the forthcoming Debate in the House of Lords .The result of that Debate might well be to establish the Government * s case so firmly that no Debate wouldbe necessary in the House of Commons,If any Question was asked on the subject the reply would be that the procedure had followed the ordinaryroutine, that the Ordinance was issued with the author-ity of the Governor last December, and that,  inaccordance with the usual custom, the formal assentwas given as soon as the Ordinance was received.The Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary of State for theColonies should be authorised, inaccordance with the normal practice to notify that the King did not       *disallow the Kenya Ordinance referredto in this Conclusion,GtfSld Discoveryin native reserves .The recentOrdinance.
THE monetary and ECONOMICCONFERENCE.(previous reference:Cabinet 68(32), Con-clusion 4.)3, The Prime Minister informed his colleagues that he had received a formal letter from, the deputy secretary-General of the League of Nations notifyinghim that the Council of the League of Nations, at its meeting held on January 26th, had decided to invitehim to act as President of the Monetary and EconomicConference,   It was, of course, only the fact thatthe Conference was to be held in London that made it possible for him to accept, but before doing so he wished to ask the assent of the Cabinet.The Cabinet agreed  That the Prime Minister should acceptthe invitation of the Council of theLeague of Nations to preside over the monetary and Economic Conference.
transport policy.(previous reference:Cabinet 3(33), Con-clusion 3,f.24.   The Prime Minister warned his colleagues thatthe question of Internal Transport was likely to raise-issues wider than the Salter Report, and that a special meeting of the Cabinet would probably be required forthe discussion of Transport questions.   The matter wasurgent, and as soon as the Cabinet Committee had madesufficient progress he proposed to arrange a special meeting of the Cabinet.2, Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.1,January 30, 19 33.

(This Document is the Prpperty,ofLHis., B^jtarinie,&quot;Majjests \ s, Government.)S E 0 R. E.T -CABINET on toe, subject of the &quot;BRITISH WAR DEBT TO THE UNITEDJANUARY 30&apos;  1933,  at, gJ^ETT.(Cabinet 5 (ggs) .)THE PRIME MINISTER recalled that the conference which Mr Roosevelt, the President-Eleet   had held atWashington with President Hoover^on the subject of war debts had resulted in a deadlock.   He himself had feltthat this must not prevent us from getting in as directtouch as might prove possible with the President-Elect.Various gentlemen had proposed themselves as intermediaries.At. last, however, he had received information &quot;of the mostreliable character from Mr Roosevelt himself of a man whohad been in,London not Iqrq ngu and imd DUBm sentjitoLondon by the President-Elect,-   Ite/had given warning thatthe fact of conversations was likely to get into the newspapers.   The individual in question was Mr Bullatt,whom he himself had known as a friend for many years.As soon as Mr Bullett arrived here, questions had been raised as to whether he was tho right mat..   He was, however,the bearer of a letter from Mr Roosevelt, and the authenti-city of his recent contact with Mr Roosevelt was beyond shadow of doxibt.   The Prime Minister even had the evidenceof a telephonic conversation between Mr Bull&amp;tt andMr Roosevelt, which had been taken down by a person in hisconfidence, with Mr Bulljtfs consent, from a secondreceiver, word for word.   He himself felt it his duty to-1-
listen to anyone who purported to come from Mr Roosevelt,so as to obtain every possible information as to what wasin Mr Roosevelt&apos;s mind.Certain proposals had been made in the preliminarystages.   The position at the moment was that, as theresult of a conversation between the Prime Minister, theLord President of the Council, the Chancellor of theExcheouer and the President of the Board of Trade, a    \(JkJ^ fpi^.   o-f   [at e-^&quot;&quot; /request by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs^had been agreed to that Sir Ronald Lindsay, the british ambassador in Washington.should be asked to return atonce.   That information had been allowed to become publicdeliberately.   The immediate result had been thatMr Roosevelt had asked Sir Ronald Lindsay to visit him.A conversation had taken place, and Sir Ronald Lindsaywas due in London at the beginning of the following week.That was where matters stood as regards consultation upto date.   He and three or four of his colleagues had been considering what should be the attitude of the G-overnment,and he would now ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer toexplain what ho ^q^^^mYnrl .,tj pc^vy^H^^J) /-^*^*THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said that the conversations had been of an exploratory character.Mr BullBtt had brought certain suggestions, which wereunderstood to emanate from Mr Roosevelt himself.   The firstneed was to understand the nature of the proposals, most ofwhich had been published in the United States and here.It seemed clear that Mr Roosevelt was anxious to comefinally to agreement with us.   He appeared to be particu-larly apprehensive of the possibility of a default.The position of the new President was that he exercisedhis power at a maximum at the beginning of his term of office, for the reason that he *i*44 had a good deal of-2-
patronage to dispose of, and that was apt to renderCongress the more amenable.   Mr Roosevelt was no doubtaware of his ultimate difficulties with Congress, andconsequently wanted to arrange beforehand proposalswhich he could submit to Congress while he was in astrong position.It appeared to the Chancellor of the exchequer that Mr Roosevelt had devoted his attention almostentirely to obtaining a settlement with the UnitedKingdom without fully realising the importance of asettlement with others if chaos was to be avoided.   Hehad been considering what he could afford to concede tous with a prospect of getting it accepted by Congress,and what concessions he could obtain from us to make theacceptance of his proposals easier.   His idea was saidto be to scale down the debt very considerably, so thatthe interest on the debt would be reduced to .4 per cent.This, for practical purposes, was the lowest rate demanded by America from any debtor (viz., Italy).   At the sametime he had expressed a desire for conversations at anearly date, with a view to reaching an understanding before march 4th.   Mr Roosevelt evidently realised that if anyonein a Ministerial position was sent for the purpose of such conversations his activities would be the subject ofincessant observation in America, and he rather hoped,therefore, that someone might undertake the mission whowould not be observed.   He was also hoping to discuss thequestion of getting us back to Gold, and other questionsof that order.   His spirit was friendly, and he was willingto use his influence to obtain co-operation from theSmeriean Federal Reserve Bank.In considering this suggestion, one question thatarose at once was as to whether it would be retrospective.-5-
He gathered that this was not the intention.   Anotherquestion was as to whether, supposing a settlement wasagreed upon, payments would be resumed immediately, orwhether there was a possibility of a moratorium.   He was glad to say that Mr Roosevelt contemplated somethingcomparable to the Lausanne moratorium, probably Ma tho-^ett hvs-eS- three years .THE PRIME MINISTER observed that this had been thefirst proposal, but that there seemed to be an idea thatthe moratorium might last so long that the American public would forget what was to be paid.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER continued thatMr Bullmtt had been given to understand that, although wewere very interested, there still seemed to be a consider-able gap between Mr Roosevelt&apos;s ideas and our own.   TheBritish Ministers had emphasised the importance of the lausanne settlement being ratified, which necessitated an interest on our part in the position of other countries.The reply had been that something of the same kind was contemplated in their case also.    That would put us atsome disadvantage, since hitherto we had paid on a much higher rate of interest than they.   Nevertheless it wouldbe difficult to settle with Mr Roosevelt without knowingthe position of other nations and to be sure that theywould be able to ratify the Lausanne Treaty.   All thiswas a good way short of what he had hoped for.   very heavy payments would still be involved under these proposals,far more than would be received from Germany.   What hewould like would be a global settlement comparable to theterms accorded to Germany at Lausanne.   It had to beremembered, however, that we were a creditor as well as adebtor nation, and could demand something from our debtors.It did not look easy, however, to get a settlement of that-4-
kind.   The Prime Minister had made clear to Mr Bullffittthat a number of conditions would have to be satisfiedbefore we could get back to the Gold Standard, and had intimated also that it would be extremely difficult tomake agreements outside of debts on matters that would come before the World Monetary and Economic Conference.If that happened, other nations might refuse to come tothe Conference.   The Prime Minister had pointed out the dangers in that direction, and had also made clear thedifficulties of finding a suitable emissary who was neither a Minister nor an Official.    It was thought that conversations might be conducted by Sir Ronald Lindsay.Consequently it had been a very happy coincidence thatthe announcement of Sir Ronald Lindsay&apos;s visit to london had resulted in his invitation from Mr Roosevelt.   Thiswould enable conversations to take place without any suggestion of secret diplomacy.    It was  obvious that american public opinion had a long way to go, as hadMr Roosevelt himself, before their ideas approached toour own.    For this a certain amount of time was necessary.So long as we could obtain a moratorium during the conversations it was unnecessary to agitate ourselvesabout delay.   Time must work in our favovir, for the facts of the situation would tend to bring the Americans to seethe ill effects on the United States of a continuance ofpayments.   Although it was impossible as yet to see our way through the jungle, nevertheless he felt fairly confidentin his own mind.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the first difficultythax, had been foreseen in using Sir Ronald Lindsay for the conversations had been that this would have violated thecanons of propriety.    It was known that at first theproposal was not aoeeptableto the United States Government.The invitation to Sir Ronald Lindsay to visit Mr Roosevelt,-5-
however, had been sent with the approval of Mr Stimson,which cleared away this particular difficulty. Mr Rooseveltwould not be back in Ma&amp;&amp;Mi &amp;&apos;&amp;&amp; until February 20th, andthen/conversations might take place direct between theLPresident-Elect and the Ambassador.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS, in replyto a question, said that no details had yet been received of Sir Ronald Lindsay&apos;s conversations with Mr Roosevelt.THE PRIME MINISTER said it was now known thatMr roosevelt&apos;s idea was to approach other Governments.Mr Builitt had proceeded to Paris and Rome, and was nowunderstood to be in Berlin, though he was probably handi-capped by the Government crisis there.   An invitation had actually been sent to Italy to send someone to Washingtonfor conversations.   Mr roosevelt&apos;s attitude was to make a distinction between those nations who had paid theirinstalment of the Debt last December, and. those who had not.An exception appeared to have been made in the case ofFrance, but it was understood that M. Paul-Boncour had beenaiming at some arrangement whereby the instalment could betreated as a payment which it was intended to make.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS drew attention to the telegram in which the American invitation to send representatives had been answered.   Its terms hadeconomic questions, but to make clear that they must not prejudice the World Monetary and Economic Conference.The French had been gratified to see that we did notencourage an Anglo-American bargain prior to the world conference.THE PRIME MINISTER added that they realised that wewere playing, as usual, the straight game.been veryout discussions on
THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS suggestedthat there was as much to be done in the way of preparatory work on this side as in America.   The kind of questions that would have to be considered were:-   Are we to agreeto pay anything in June:    if so, what maximum paymentcoulo. we make?   Was there any quid pro quo that we could offer America?   What would be the effect of default?THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said that thematter was not really quite so simple.   The answer to thefirst question, for example, would be that materially wecould pay.   We had collected a certain amount of gold,and might collect some more, and another shipment, there-fore, would not be impossible.   But this could not go onindefinitely, and the evil results would accumulate with every payment.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said thathis question was not intended to mean^oould we paymaterially? but rather whether, in negotiating,a payment was within the possibilities that we could consider.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said it was really a matter of principle.   He thought that either we shouldhave to pay the whole or nothing.THE PRIME MINISTER said that what he really wanted\A i Vi n3- was what Gu^ht to be our attitude in June?L We\toArkeat the December payment as the last under theold systemjf^ We ought also to consider what was to be ouridea of a settlement;    that is to say, what should we beprepared to put before Mr Roosevelt as the BritishGovernment&apos;s idea of the final settlement?   Put in another way, the question was as to how was America to become,as it were, a partner in the Lausanne settlement?   He wouldlike the Treasury to get to work on these questions.Their Paper must be a very clear one, and in such a form
J that Sir Ronald Lindsay could take it away with him touse as a brief.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER hoped that therewould be no question of recording on the Minutes thatif America was so foolish as to press us to pay we shoulddefault.   This d*a,d. aaot-meanfthat we couldjaa* negotiate on the assumption that any further payment, except onthe lines of the Lausanne terms, would be impossible.THE PRIME MINISTER said the question was, giventhe existence of the Lausanne settlement, by which theGovernment intended to stand, how could America make asettlement with Europe?   What should be our attitude, soas to render the United States, in effect, a partner inthe Lausanne settlement?   He thought we should be very careful about a moratorium, as it might tend to blockthe whole of the European recovery.   Lausanne had provedinvaluable in holding up a great deal of uns ettlenientand difficulty, but at present the agreement was not inactive operation.    It might be that the best plan wouldbe a moratorium in June, but Mr Roosevelt must not be encouraged to think that we could continue from June toDecember and December to June, and so on.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat Sir Ronald Lindsay would require a good deal ofassistance in the way of information and instructions.THE PRIME MINISTER said his idea would be to prepare a Memorandum, to give it to Sir Ronald Lindsay on his arrival and to ask him to consider it and come back withhis views .    In reply to a question, he said that the idea was that Sir Ronald Lindsay should be put in a position toJa&amp;gofea^Le with Mr Roosevelt jua *l he had made his inauguralspeech as President.   That speech was a very important eventin the life of a President, and before making it he ought-8-
to be in possession of our views .THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said that he washoping that Sir Ronald. Lindsay would come with a seriesof questions from Mr Roosevelt. He was having somefigures made out as to the effect of various proposals,but it was rather difficult to formulate anything very definite until he had heard what Sir Ronald Lindsay hadto say.Some discussion took place as to the reportedactivities of various Professors of Economics who were at work on these questions on Mr roosevelt&apos;s behalf, after which the Cabinet took the decision recorded in the cabinet minutes .&apos;7, v2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,January 30, 1933.
